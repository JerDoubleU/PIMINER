Page 5 EXAMINATION BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.       Sir, would you please state your full name.

A.   Charles David Garner.

Q.       And what is your current occupation, sir?

A.  My current occupation is I'm a senior director in regulatory oversight for Reynolds American Services Company.

Q.  What is your business address, sir?

A.  My business address is 401 North Main Street, Winston-Salem, North Carolina 27102.

Q.  And, sir, are you a medical doctor?

A.   I am not.

Q.  You are a PhD, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And am I correct in that your training is in the field of toxicology?

A.  Yes, sir, that's correct.

g   Can we agree that toxicology generally is the study of adverse effects of chemicals on the human body?

A.  I think that's reasonable.

Q.   And will you agree, sir, that there are chemicals in cigarette smoke?

A.  Yes.  Yes, I would.

1       Q.  And would you agree, sir, that the

2  chemicals in cigarette smoke have harmful effects on

3  humans?

4       A.  Yeah.  I would certainly agree that there

5  are some chemicals in cigarette smoke that have the

6  potential to cause harmful effects in humans.

7       Q.   Is lung cancer a harmful effect, sir?

8       A.  Yes.  I would classify lung cancer as a

9  harmful effect,

10      Q.   And can lung cancer be caused by smoking

11  Reynolds' cigarettes?

13  for lung cancer in people that smoke, yes.

14       Q.  And would you agree, sir, that addiction is

15  a harmful effect of smoking?

16      A.  Well, I would agree that addiction is sort

17  of a classification of a behavior of which smoking is

18  one,  I don't know if addiction in and of itself is a

19  harmful effect because it's not really an effect.

20           But certainly many people that smoke can be

21  classified by current definitions as being addicted.

22       Q.  Well, you just told m. that smoking

23  Reynolds' cigarettes today can cause lung cancer,

24  right?

25      A.  That's correct.

Page 7 Q.  And can we agree that smoking Reynolds' cigarettes today can result in addiction to nicotine?

A.  Yes, it certainly can.

q. And can we agree, sir, today that nicotine is a chemical in Reynolds' cigarettes?

A.  I think we can.  Nicotine is in the tobacco that we use, and we make cigarettes from tobacco, so nicotine is in Reynolds' cigarettes, yes?

Q.   And has nicotine been in Reynolds' cigare^T^es since tns x^ous.

A.  Well, I think that there has been nicotine in all cigarettes because nicotine is naturally present in tobacco.

Q.  Well, then can we agree that there has been nicotine present in all Reynolds' cigarettes manufactured from 1950 to the present time?

A.  Yes.  Yes, we can.

Q. Can we agree that all Reynolds' cigarettes manufactured from 1950 to the present time can cause lung cancer in smokers?

A.  Yeah.  I don't think there is � I don't think there is a safe cigarette.  I think all cigarettes carry with them risk.  So all cigarettes have the potential to cause lung cancer.

Q.   Okay.  So as a toxicologist, you are

1  trained to study the harmful effects of chemicals,

2  correct?

3       A.  That's correct.

4       Q.  And there are chemicals in all Reynolds'

5  products that are sold today, correct?

6      A.   I don't know what you mean by "chemicals,"

7  sir.  I mean, if you're saying when a cigarette is

8  smoked, are there products from the pyrolysis of the

9  tobacco that are formed, the answer is "yes."

10           But there are a number of cigarettes that

11  we make that we don't add any chemicals to.  So if

12  you're talking about the constituents of cigarette

13  smoke, then the answer would be "yes."

14       Q.  Don't you use recon, reconstituted tobacco,

15  in the manufacture of your cigarettes?

16      A.   Yes, sir.

17       Q.  And don't you, during the process of

18  creating the modern cigarette with reconstituted

19  tobacco � doesn't that result in the production of

20  harmful carcinogenic chemicals?

21       A.   Well, I think the production of chemicals

22  during the smoking of the cigarette is not just from

23  the recon, it's from all of the tobacco that's

24  present.  So I guess I'm not really following your

25  link to reconstituted tobacco.

Page 9 Q.  Well, let's talk just briefly, and we'll explore this in greater detail a little bit later in the deposition, but let's talk about what cancer � what carcinogens are in the tobacco that Reynolds uses before it's even burned. A.   Okay.

Do you understand?

O LI X" c* *

And what is a tobacco-specific nitrosamine,

A. Q.

sir?

A.  A tobacco-specific nitrosamine, which I'll refer to as a TSNA going forward because it's easier, it's a chemical that is formed during the curing of tobacco.

Q.  And that is formed during the curing of reconstituted tobacco, correct?

A.  No.  Reconstituted tobacco is not cured. Reconstituted tobacco is made from pieces of tobacco that are not � not appropriate based on their size to be incorporated into a cigarette.

So reconstituted tobacco is made from already cured tobacco, and it's just made into what we call a sheet form and is cut into the appropriate size to be incorporated into a cigarette.

1  nitrosamines that are present in your product, they

2  are very strong cancer-causing chemicals, are they

4       A.  They have been shown to cause cancer in

5  laboratory animals, yes.

6      Q.   Well, they have been linked directly to

7  lung cancer in humans, haven't they?

8      A.   I'm not aware of that.

9      Q.   Okay.  Well, does the level of TSNAs in

10  Reynolds' cigarettes depend on the type of tobacco

11  used?

12      A.  Yes.  There are differences in levels of

13  TSNAs from certain types of tobaccos, yes,

14       Q.  Does the level of TSNAs in Reynolds'

15  cigarettes depend on how the tobacco used is

16  processed?

17       A.   I'm not sure I follow your question,

18  Mr. Wichmann.

19      Q.  Okay.  Well, we've agreed that there are

20  TSNAs in the tobacco used in Reynolds' cigarettes,

23      Q.   And we have agreed that the levels of the

24  TSNAs in Reynolds' cigarettes depends on the type of

25  tobacco used, correct?

Page 11 A.  Correct.

Q.   How does the processing of the tobacco affect the level of TSNAs, if at all?

Pim       well, i�c me jusl asK a ciantying question. When you say the "processing" of tobacco, do you mean the way we process it to manufacture cigarettes, or by "processing" do you mean curing?

Q.  I mean both.  I mean both.

A.  Okay. Well, let's start with the � let's start with the curing phase.

Q.   Okay.

A.  There is basically three types of tobaccos that are included in an American-blended cigarette. There is burley tobacco, there's flue-cured tobacco, and there's Turkish tobacco.

Let's start with Turkish.  Turkish is grown in, obviously, Turkey, but also in Greece and other countries.  It's a different type of a variety of tobacco.  It's grown in a very dry type of a climate, it's sun-cured, and it has very low levels of TSNAs. The second type of tobacco I mentioned is called flue-cured tobacco. That's the type of tobacco that's grown in North Carolina and Virginia. It's large-leaf tobacco.  That tobacco is harvested by the leaf. It's hung in a barn, and it's

1  heat-cured.

2           Now, with respect to the curing process,

3  the levels of TSNAs in flue-cured tobacco have been

4  reduced very significantly since probably late '90s,

5  early 2000s when Reynolds kind of was responsible for

6  the introduction of a process called indirect fire

7  curing.

8           And I can go into as much detail about that

9  as you want, but the end result of that was the

10  levels of TSNAs in flue-cured tobacco have been

11  reduced somewhere in the neighborhood of 90 to

12  95 percent since the introduction of those process

13  changes, those curing changes.

14           Third type of tobacco is called burley

15  tobacco. That's grown in Tennessee and parts of

16  Virginia and other parts of North Carolina.  That

17  tobacco is air-cured, which means it's harvested and

18  it is cured in a barn, but it is not heated.

19           We have made some strides in being able to

20  reduce the levels of TSNAs in burley tobacco, but

21  since it is not heat-cured, it's air-cured, the

22  weather during the curing phase has a significant

23  impact on that and we don't have -- we don't have any

24  tools currently to be able to control that.

25           We have made some steps that have been able

to reduce TSNAs in hurley, but not to the extent that we have been able to reduce them in flue-cured tobacco.

So that's the � I'm sorry? Q.   Go ahead.  Please finish.

Then I asked you for clarification on curing versus processing.  If by "processing" you mean what we do to the tobacco when we receive it, as we're getting ready to prepare it to be included in cigarettes, I'm really � I'm struggling to find anything we do to it that has an impact on that. Most of the TSNA formation is during the curing phase.

So with respect to the lamina, which is the leaf tobacco, I don't think there's much that we do that has an impact on that either to raise or lower it.

With respect to processing of, say, the reconstituted tobacco, probably on a per-gram basis, I think the recon has probably lower levels of TSNAs than do the lamina in hurley and flue-cured by virtue of the fact that there are stems or pieces of stems that are incorporated into the reconstituted tobacco, and those stems have very low levels of TSNAs.

1           So I don't know if that's what you were

2  trying to get at with your question, but that's my

3  answer.

4       O   Well  1st' s t&lJc "lust birisflv sbout thG

z^    three types of tobacco that you testified to and the

6  curing phase for each.

7       A.   Sure.

9    manufactured from 1955 through 1994, which blend of

10  tobacco was used?

11       A.  Well, again, you know, I haven't studied

12  blend sheets sort of across that entire phase, but

13  Winston is an American-blended cigarette, so I think

14  it would be reasonable to conclude that it included a

15  mix of all three types of those tobaccos, the burley,

16  the flue-cured and the oriental.

1*7     Q.  Would you agree, sir, that the tobacco used

18  in Winston cigarettes from 1954 to 1994 had higher

19  TSNAs, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, than the

20  Winston cigarettes that are sold today?

21      A.   I'm really not sure.  I mean, I would have

22  to kind of go back and look at those levels in

23  tobaccos.  But it's probably � it's probably

24  important to note that people didn't even know that

25  there were a particular class of compounds called

1  TSNAs back in the '50s.  I don't think that became a

2  scientific fact until probably at the earliest

3  sometime in the late '60s, maybe even in the '70s.

4           So it's probably unlikely that we would

5  even have any measurements for TSNAs going back to

6  1954, whatever the time you quoted from the 1950s*

7       Q.   Do you currently work for � well, let me

8  backtrack.

9           Who do you receive your paychecks from

10  today?

11       A.  I receive my paycheck from Reynolds

12  American Services Company-

13      Q.   And Reynolds American Services Company

14  controls R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, correct?

15       A.  No, that's not correct. lb     q,  What is the relationship?

17       A.   Let me try to explain this.  I don't even

18  know if this is the right term because I'm a

19  scientist, I'm not a business guy, but the parent

20  company, for lack of a better term, is called

21  Reynolds American, Incorporated. And then under

22  Reynolds American, Incorporated, there are a number

23  of companies. One is R. J. Reynolds Tobacco,

24  There's a couple of other tobacco companies, American

25  Snuff Company, Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company.

15  responsibilities as a senior director.

16           And based on my performance against those

17  goals, that is how my overall bonus is calculated.

18      Q.   Well, let's talk first about the

19  performance of the company.  The company stock is up

20  today, isn't it?

21      A.   I haven't checked it today.

22      Q.   How has it been doing in the last month?

23      A.  It's been relatively stable.  I think it

24  was down for a while and then it came up.  I think

Q.  Well, you would agree that the company is doing pretty well this year, isn't it?

A.  Well, the year is not over.  I think the company is doing fine.  I think we're kind of on plan.  But, again, I'm a scientist.  I'm not a finance guy.  I don't spend a lot of time tracking that.

A.  Yes.  Correct.

Q.  And what are those goals? Do those goals include testifying on behalf of Reynolds in Engle progeny cases in Florida?

A.  That is not one of my goals.  That is not factored into my performance at all.

2  am given stock, and that stock is calculated roughly

3  using the same formula that the bonus is calculated

4  on.  So it's based on the performance of the company

Q.  How many shares of stock do you own today in Reynolds American?

1       Q.   So is the disclosure that is marked as

2  Exhibit C � is it up to date insofar as your

3  previous testimony is concerned?

4       A.  Yes, I believe it is.

5      Q.  Are you planning on appearing at trial in

7       A.  If they want me to testify in this case,

8  then I will make myself available.

9      Q.  When were you first aware that you were

10  listed as a fact and an expert witness in the George

11  Dion versus R. J. Reynolds case?

12       A.  I don't have an exact date.  I mean, as

13  best I understand the process, you guys say that you

14  want a deposition, that's usually a couple of months

15  in advance.  I offer some dates that work for me, and

16  then you and Mr. Latham or whoever else figure out

17  what date works best for you.

18           So I'm guessing probably a couple of months

19  ago.

20      Q.   Now, the reliance list that has been

21  provided and is attached as an exhibit to this

22  deposition is 51 pages long, correct, sir?

23      A.   Yes, that's correct.

24       Q.  Does this list contain all of the material

25  that you plan on relying on in order to testify in

11  correct?

12      A.   Yeah, in general terms.  I think it's

A.  Well, I think we are � we're working with the FDA.  I know that's one of the main points that the FDA is focused on right now. And we have people that are members of the TPSAC, Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory Committee, that are looking into that particular aspect of smoking.

because the FDA regulates tobacco products, and

we manufacture tobacco products. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.  All of your tobacco products � all of Reynolds' tobacco products that they sell today contain nicotine, correct?

A.  Yes.  Correct.

Q.   And nicotine is a drug, correct?

A.   In some forms, yes.

Q.  Well, you would agree that nicotine, in its form in a cigarette, when smoked has a physiological impact on the body?

A.   Yes.  Yes, I would.

Q.   As a toxicologist, sir, is nicotine a poison?

A.  At high doses nicotine can be a poison. Obviously, at doses that people can be exposed to nicotine either through use of tobacco products or use of drugs that contain nicotine, like NRTs, it's not a poison.

Q.  At what levels does nicotine go from being a drug to a poison, sir?

A.  I don't have that information off the top of my head.

Q.  Do you know whether Reynolds ever acquired the American Tobacco Company?

Q.   And what is the relationship in the history of R. J. Reynolds between R. J. Reynolds and British American Tobacco Company?

5      A.  I don't know,

7       A.  Well, I mean, for the most part it was my g     job to choose the documents that I wanted on my

9    reliance list.  I would ask people in the Reynolds'

10  library to provide me documents.  I would go to

11  RJRTdocs.com, print out documents.  I've asked

12  various people for help in getting me documents on

13  any particular subject matter.

15  help you put this reliance list together employees of

16  Reynolds or one of its affiliated companies?

17       A.   Probably out of all of these documents, I

18  probably asked people at Womble to provide me

19  documents on a particular subject matter, but the

20  choice of documents to include on the list was solely

21  mine.

22       Q.  Again, the people at Womble would be the

2  for,  I'm guessing probably some of them were

3  paralegals and other members of the clerical staff.

4  But it was a request from me for documents on a

5  particular topic. They provided me the documents, I

6  reviewed the documents, and I chose what documents I

7  wanted to be on my reliance list.

8       Q.   Do you have any U.S. Surgeon General's

9  reports on your reliance list?

10      A.  Again, I don't recall.  Do you want me to

11  look through it?

12       Q.   Sure.

13      A.  Okay.  Yes.

14       Q.       Which one, sir?

15      A.  Well, I'm going in chronological order

16  here, so the first one I came up with is document or

17  number 292, which is the 1964 Surgeon General's

18  report, which was the first one. I'm sure you're

19  aware of that.

20      Q.  Right.  Okay.  The 1964 Surgeon General's

21  report, you asked someone to pull that to include on

22  your reliance list, correct?

23      A.  Well, again, I don't recall the process.  I

Q.   What is that, sir?

A.   That is the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company website.

Q.   And what is posted on the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company website, sir?

A.  Well, there's a lot of information posted on the website. What's posted on the website is a detailed summary of our guiding principles and beliefs. Also posted on our website is the list of ingredients that we use in our products. Also posted on the website are links to some very useful information that our consumers might have with respect to the risk of smoking, such as the previous Surgeon General's reports and other publications in tnat particular arena.

Q.  And doesn't R. J. Reynolds, on its website today, tell consumers to look to and rely on the U.S. Surgeon General's reports for smoking and health information?

A.  Not yet, but I will shortly.  Okay.

Q.       We discussed the last two pages of that earlier, correct, when we discussed your prior testimony?

A.   Yes, we did.

1  rundown on which products you intend to testify

2  about.

3      A.  Well, R. J. Reynolds makes a product called

4  Camel Snus, which is a smokeless tobacco product.  It

5  was developed in Sweden.  It's got a long history in

6  Sweden of being a migration strategy to move people

7  from smoking cigarettes to smoking � I'm sorry, to

8  using Snus.

9           It's been a huge success in Sweden with

10  respect to decreasing the risk from the use of the

11  tobacco products.  Smoking rates have gone down.

12  They're probably the lowest in the EU, and rates of

13  lung cancer have gone down, and they're probably the

14  lowest in EU.

15           So our hope is that we can use that model

16  in the United States to move people from smoking

17  cigarettes, which are sort of on the higher end of

18  the risk scale, with respect to the use of tobacco

19  products, to something that's on the lower end.

20           And Camel Snus is the largest selling brand

21  of Snus in the United States.

22      Q.      And it is sold also in Sweden, correct?

23      A.  Camel Snus is not. Snus in general is a

24  very big market in Sweden. Camel Snus is limited to

25  the United States.

Page 55 Q.  The European union banned the sale of Snus in 1992, correct?

A.  That's correct.  I don't know about the date, but I know there are several Nordic countries where Snus is used, but in the EU in general, the use of Snus is not allowed.

A.   I think most of the EU except for perhaps Sweden and some of the other Scandinavian countries.

Q.   So you'd agree in most of Europe it's against the law to sell Snus?

A.  That's correct.

Q.   And one of the reasons for that is the World Health Organization concluded that Snus contains carcinogens, correct?

THE WITNESS:  I don't know what their

A.  It probably does. If it's a tobacco product it probably contains some TSNAs, but certainly the TSNAs are much lower than other forms of tobacco.  Because of the way that Snus is processed, it's not fermented and it's heat-treated, the levels of most toxicants that you would see in other forms of smokeless tobacco are significantly lower.

Q.   But Snus does carry soma risks, doesn't it?

A.   Sure.  All tobacco products carry risk. But certainly those risks are not equal for all tobacco products, and I think the risk in using Snus is much less from the risk of smoking.

Q.  Well, Snus contains nicotine, does it not?

A.  Yes, it does.

Q.  So it has a couple of things in common with cigarettes, right?

A.  It's made from tobacco.  It contains some of the same components that are present in cigarettes. But, again the overall risk is significantly lower than the risk of smoking.

Q.  Well, it does contain nicotine, and cigarettes contain nicotine, right?

A.   Correct.

cigarettes contain nitrosamines, correct?

A.   Yes.  Although the levels of nitrosamines in Snus are significantly lower than the levels in cigarettes and other types of smokeless products.

Q.   Is it your testimony here today, Dr. Garner, that Snus delivers less cancer"Causing nitrosamines than R. J. Reynolds' cigarettes?

from using Snus is lower than from smoking cigarettes, not just R. J. Reynolds' cigarettes, any cigarettes.

Q.  Well, aren't there studies that show that young adults smoke cigarettes along with Snus?

A.  I have not seen any of those studies, but it would be reasonable to think that perhaps people use Snus and cigarettes during the path of migration from smoking to sole use of Snus.

Q.  Well, along that path, sir, that's not a one-way street in the sense that many teens use Snus at the same time they smoke cigarettes, right?  It's not one or the other.  You'd agree to that, right? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I think that's what I just

Q.       So the FDA, the U.S. government, made it illegal for Reynolds to use the terms "lights/* "mild" or "ultralights" on their cigarette packages, correct?

A.  Yes, sir, that's correct.

Q.  And that's because Reynolds, by using those descriptors, was giving smokers the impression that

	THE WITNESS:  That probably was their

	to let the consumers know that there's basically

14
	
	different tar levels between a light cigarette

15

Q.  Would you agree or disagree with this statement: Low tar and filtered cigarette smokers inhale essentially the same amount of tar and nicotine as they would from regular cigarettes?

A.  I would disagree with that.

Q.  Why?

A.  Because we have done studies and that is not � that's not true.  People that smoke lower tar cigarettes do receive, on average, less tar and nicotine than do smokers of higher tar cigarettes. And there is a number of publications out there from a number of different authors that demonstrate that

Q.  Well, you would agree, would you not, that over the years many smokers switched to low tar and

light cigarettes were less harmful?

A.  Yeah, I certainly think that's reasonable because the Surgeon General in a number of SGRs clearly stated if you're going to smoke, you would be better off switching to a lower tar product and not over smoking it.

So I'm not aware that Reynolds ever made any statements with respect to that, but that was laid out clearly in several of the Surgeon General's

Q.  Well, are you aware of a document that he authored in 1972 that states the following:  "If as claimed by some anti-tobacco critics, the alleged health hazard of smoking is directly related to the amount of tar to which the smoker is exposed per day and the smoker bases his consumption on nicotine, then a present low tar, low nicotine cigarette offers zero advantage to the smoker over regular filtered

Are you aware of that document, sir?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't recall having read that document or seen it in deposition.  But, again, that would be obviously � that would be Dr. Teague's view.  I don't think that was the view of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco. That was the view of one individual.

1  in cigarette smoke is tar, correct?

2      A.  Well, this is where I have to be a

3  scientist. Tar is technically not a chemical. Tar

4  is a classification of the particulate matter, weight

5  of total particulate matter minus water and nicotine

6  that is collected on a pad during smoking, using a

7  standardized method on a smoking machine.

8           So tar technically is not a chemical.  It's

9  a description of what I just described.

10      Q.   Well, it's a mixture of a lot of chemicals,

11  isn't it?

12       A.   Correct.

13      Q.   And many of those chemicals that form tar

14  cause cancer, right?

15      A.  Many of the carcinogens that have been

16  identified in cigarette smoke are in the particulate

17  fraction, which means that they are contained in the

18  tar, if that's the question that you're asking.

19      Q.  Well, in simple terms, wouldn't you agree

20  that tar is the constituent in cigarettes � one of

21  the constituents in cigarettes that causes lung

22  cancer?

23      A.  It feels like we're kind of speaking a

24  different language here, Mr. Wichmann.  I don't view

25  tar as a constituent.  I view a constituent as an

1  individual chemical. But certainly many of the

2  chemicals that have been identified by some agency as

3  being carcinogens are present in the tar fraction.  I

4  think we're saying the same thing.

5      Q.   Let me see if I can break my question down.

6           Isn't it true that when a cigarette burns

7  it produces tar?

8       A.  That is true.

9      Q.   And isn't it true that tar is a mixture of

10  chemicals?

11      A.  That also is true.

12      Q.   And isn't it true that some of the

13  chemicals in the mixture known as tar cause lung

14  cancer?

15       A.   Some of the components that are present in

16  the tar fraction have been identified as carcinogens

17  by a number of different agencies or regulatory

18  bodies. Whether they specifically cause lung cancer

19  or not, some probably have been determined to cause

20  lung cancer, some probably have not.

21           But with respect to carcinogens present in

22  tar, of which there's about 70, yes, some of them

23  have been classified as carcinogens.  I don't know if

24  they specifically have been classified as lung

25  carcinogens.

In simple terms/ when a cigarette is burned, it produces smoke and the smoke contains benzene, right?

A.  Yes.  In simple terms, yes.

7       Q.   Would agree that smokers can have up to

8  four times as much cadmium in their blood as

9  nonsmokers?

10      A.   I don't know where those numbers came from,

11  but certainly smokers could be exposed to more

12  cadmium than people that aren't exposed to cadmium

13  through other sources.

14       Q.      Cadmium is a known cause of cancer,

19  having the possibility of being a carcinogen.

Q.  How about formaldehyde? What is formaldehyde?

A.  Formaldehyde is � it's a liquid at room temperature.  It's an organic compound of low molecular weight that is formed during the pyrolysis of tobacco.

Q.  So in simple terms, can we agree that when tobacco smoke � when cigarette smoke is produced, it is a source of formaldehyde?

10  chemicals on an individual basis.  I know it's

11  classified as some level of its carcinogenicity.  I

12  just don't know whether it's a known carcinogen or a

13  potential carcinogen or a probable carcinogen. There

14  are a number of classifications.  But it would be

15  included as one of my 70.

16      Q.       What is polonium 210, sir?

18  element plutonium.

19      Q.   Does tobacco smoke produce polonium 210?

20      A.   I don't know.  I know there have been some

21  reports that you can measure polonium 210 in tobacco

23           But, again, that's one that would not be

A.  Is that your question?

Page 76 f the tar level in their cigarettes, right?

A. Yeah, well � yes, we make our cigarettes at differing tar levels because people's tastes are different. Some people prefer a fuller smoke, some people prefer a less full smoke.

So, you know, sort of across all of our cigarette brands, we have some that are higher in tar, we have some that are lower in tar.

Q.  Well, in a general sense, wouldn't you agree that by controlling the tar in their cigarette, that Reynolds can also control the nicotine in their cigarettes?

A.   In a very general sense, I probably would. I mean, the nicotine tracks the tar.  So as tar levels go down, the nicotine levels go down.  But it's not a one-to-one relationship due to variability in crop year. And so it's not a tight control of the nicotine as we have control of the tar.

But in a general sense, I think you're correct.  The nicotine � as tar goes down, the nicotine will also go down.

20  since ammonium hydroxide has a base, it theoretically

21  could impact the PH of cigarette smoke, but in

22  practice, it doesn't.

Q.       Correct.

A.   I believe � again, I haven't been through blend sheets going back to when � you know, going back as far as I could, but I know Reynolds has added diammonium phosphate and ammonium hydroxide to reconstituted tobacco that are used in some of our cigarette brands.

Q.       And reconstituted tobacco was used prior to 1994 in Winston brand Reynolds' cigarettes, correct?

A.  Yes, sir, that's correct.

Q.   Does Reynolds add ammonia to their reconstituted cigarettes for flavor?

3       Q.   Okay.  And how about freon? What is freon?

4       A.   Is freon on the list?  I don't see freon on

5  the list.

6       Q.  I'm going to get to that in a second.

7  First I'm going to ask you, what is freon?

8       A.  Freon is a chemical that is used for a

9  number of purposes, but back probably '70s, '80s, it

10  was used � it was used as a processing aid to aid in

11  the expansion of our tobacco.

12            Essentially, you take tobacco, you

13  impregnate that with freon, and then you expose it to

14  changes in temperature and pressure.  It causes the

15  tobacco to expand, and then the freon is removed.

16            So what you have is a � you have a tobacco

17  that is less dense.  It has more filling capacity,

18  but there's less mass that's present.  So when you

19  burn that tobacco, it's an aid that we can use to

20  reduce the tar because there is less tobacco mass in

21  the cigarette.

22       Q.   Doctor, can we agree that Exhibit E, the

23  list of additives and ingredients from the website,

24  is public knowledge?

2       Q.  What is levulinic acid, Doctor?

3      A.  That is an organic acid that we � I don't

4  think we use it today, but I know we've used it in

5  the past.  It's a flavoring component that we've

6  added to our cigarettes.

7       Q.   So would you agree that R. J* Reynolds

8  added levulinic acid to its cigarettes prior to 1994?

9       A.   I believe Reynolds added levulinic acid to 10    some of our cigarettes prior to 1994.

12  cigarettes reduce the harshness of nicotine?

13      A.  Well, I know that it is a flavorant, and I

14  know that it's used as a flavor.  But, again, when

15  you talk about what does it do, I think that is a

16  subjective judgment that one individual might answer

17  one way, one might answer another way.

18           I mean, I know we have used it in some of

19  our brands as a component of all of the flavors and

20  whether it increases the harshness or not, you know,

21  again, that's a subjective decision.

22       Q.      Well, do you know if it could make the

23  smoke smoother and less irritating to the smoker? Is

24  that possible?

Page 90 Q.   Is it possible that the addition of levulinic acid to Reynolds' cigarettes might reduce the harshness of nicotine?

A.  Well, you know, again, I don't know how you would be able to differentiate the harshness of nicotine with the harshness of smoke in general, but it may be used to make a smoother tasting smoke. Whether that's related to nicotine or whether that's related to just the flavoring, the other components of cigarette smoke, I don't have that information.

Q.  Does Reynolds add sugars to their cigarettes?

A.  We add sugars to some of our cigarette brands, yes.

cigarette brands prior to 1994?

A.   I believe the answer to that is "yes." Q.   And could the addition of sugars to R. J. Reynolds' cigarettes make the tobacco smoke smoother?

A.   It could make the tobacco smoke smoother, I would suspect, but I think there's one place we have to go to with this list of ingredients that you keep mentioning.

I mean, we add ingredients for a specific

Page 91 reason, and we add ingredients so you can be able to differentiate one cigarette from another, much like you add ingredients to other types of consumer products where taste is a factor.

We want our Camel to taste like a Camel, and we want to be able to differentiate that from a different type of cigarette on the market.  So we add ingredients for the differentiation of our specific taste profile in comparison to another cigarette. So I don't know whether it's to reduce harshness or what the specific component does, but the addition of ingredients in general is used to be able to differentiate one brand from another.  That's probably an important point that I should have made at the beginning.

Q.  What is a bronchodilator, sir?

A.  A bronchodilator? A bronchodilator is something that dilates the bronchus. I don't have a specific scientific definition, but, you know, it causes the bronchi to increase in diameter, I believe.

Q.  Are bronchodilators chemicals, sir?

A.   I would suspect that some of them could be an individual chemical or some combination of chemicals, yes.

So I don't know � at least I have not reviewed any documents that we've tested out in smokers in clinical studies that weren't tied to our reduced risk product platform.

Page 95 Dr. Fagerstrom, I think, has changed the name from Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence to Fagerstrom test for cigarette dependence. We can get into that in as much detail as you want.

But it measures a number of criteria.  It measures how many cigarettes you smoke per day.  It measures time per cigarette.  It measures other types of behavioral outcomes, and then it comes up with a composite score at the end that is used to rate an individual's level of dependence on cigarettes and tobacco products.

Q.  Is it your understanding that dependence is synonymous with addiction in the context of the Fagerstrom test?

A.  In the general context it probably is, yeah.

Q.  And is the Fagerstrom test for nicotine or cigarette dependence a valid test to measure a smoker's dependence for addiction?

A.  Well, again, valid test is in the eye of the beholder.  There are a number of tests out there that can be used to measure an individual's level of dependence on cigarettes, one of which is the Fagerstrom test, one of which is called the heaviness of smoking index, one of which is called the WISDM

2  Measures, or something like that.

3           So there are a number of tests out there.

4  I don't think any one of them is better than the

5  other.  They're all somewhat similar, and they all

6  look at roughly the same types of inputs.  But they

7  are tests that are used to sort of get a rough

8  evaluation of a person's level of dependence to

9  either cigarettes or tobacco products.

10      Q.  Well, you mentioned the eye of the

11  beholder.  At least in Reynolds' eyes, wouldn't you

12  agree that the Fagerstrom test for nicotine or

13  cigarette addiction is a valid test to measure a

14  smoker's dependency or addiction on cigarettes?

15      A.  Yeah, it's one of the tests that we use.

16  And, again, it's one of the many tests that are out

17  there.  It's one that we've chosen to use, but I

18  don't know if it's any better than any of the other

19  tests, but it certainly is a rough-cut way to kind of

20  look at the level of dependence that an individual

21  has to smoking cigarettes.

22      Q.  And when you say "we" use, you mean R. J. 2 3    Reynolds, correct?

24       A.   Yes.

25      Q.       Are you aware of any other specific tests

1  other than the Fagerstrom test for nicotine or

2  cigarette dependence that R. J. Reynolds uses as

3  criteria to determine whether or not a smoker is

4  addicted or dependent? Do you understand my 3    oruestion?

6      A.  Yes,  And the answer �

7       Q.   I know you testified earlier there is a

8  whole constellation of tests.  Now I'm specifically

9  asking you about tests that Reynolds has used to your

10  knowledge, and I want to know are there any other

11  than the Fagerstrom test?

12      A.  Short answer is I don't know the answer.  I

13  mean, I know there are other tests out there.  I know

14  Reynolds has used the Fagerstrom test. I don't know

15  if we've ever used any of the other tests. But there

16  certainly are a number of other tests out there that

17  measure sort of the same kind of point using the same

18  types of inputs.

Q.   You were asked some questions about using the chemical freon to expand tobacco.  Do you recall

those Questions?

A.   Yes, I do.

Q.   What does Reynolds use today to expand

A.  We use a chemical called carbon dioxide.

Q.  And will you remind the jury the reasons why Reynolds uses expanded tobacco in its cigarette products?

A.   Sure.  Kind of going back to something that we talked about previously, in the 1950s, one of the things that Mr. Wichmann brought up was reducing tar since tar contains many of the components thought to be hazardous would be a really good idea. And Reynolds took that seriously starting in the '50s, and we developed ways to reduce the tar in cigarettes.

The first and most obvious one was the addition of the filter. This is other things that we have done, using more porous paper. But one of the tools, one of the many tools that we used in the tobacco blend was the inclusion of the reconstituted tobacco, because that generates less tar per gram

pgNbr=103
Page 104 than does the lamina, but also the use of expanded

As I think I explained, as you do the expansion of the tobacco piece, it creates sort of a puffed version of tobacco. And then the expandent, whether it be freon or carbon dioxide, is removed, so you have a piece of tobacco that's much less dense than lamina.  So you can fill the cigarette to a higher extent with that, but when you burn it, because there's less mass there, there is less tar that was generated.

So I realize that was a long answer, but the simple answer is that is a tool that we have used to reduce tar and bring tar levels down in our cigarettes over the last 20 or 30 or 40 years or more.

Q.   In the 1970s, I think you testified that Reynolds was using freon as its expansion processing agent; is that right?

Q, When Reynolds decided to use freon, did it conduct scientific testing to verify that the use of freon wouldn't increase the toxicity of the expanded tobacco?

A.  We conducted very significant scientific

1  testing, which included chemistry, in vitro biology,

2  which is a work in cells, as well as, if I'm not

3  mistaken, we did some animal work as well to

4  determine if the inclusion of freon would increase

5  the overall inherent risk of smoking. And the answer

6  came out no, it did not, which again, is not that

7  surprising because freon is very volatile.

8           It's used as a processing aid to expand the

9  tobacco, but then it's blown off at the end. And I

10  don't think there is any residual freon that's even

11  left in the processed tobacco.

12       Q.  You were asked about a chemical called

13  phosgene.  Do you know whether or not Reynolds did

14  chemical testing to verify that phosgene was not

15  produced when its expanded tobacco was burned?

16      A.   I believe we did, and I believe the answer

17  was no.  There was no phosgene that was able to be

18  measured in that expanded tobacco.

19      Q.   You were asked a number of questions about

20  ingredients, and you were shown a version of the

21  ingredient list on your website.  I want to ask you

22  some follow-up questions about that, the first of

23  which is a basic question:  Why does Reynolds use

24  additives or ingredients in its cigarette products?

25      A.  Sure.  I tried to get into that a little

1  bit on the question from Mr. Wichmann, but we want

2  our Camel to taste like a Camel. We want all of our

3  brands to have a distinct difference so our consumers

4  can be able to differentiate them from a different

5  brand.

6            So we add chemicals, we add them at the

7  lowest level possible, and we add as few as possible

8  to be able to achieve the sensory properties that we

9  want in our particular products.

10            As kind of an aside, but something that I

11  think is relevant to my answer, is all of the

12  chemicals that are used in our products, not only the

13  ingredients but anything that's in the cigarette, is

14  evaluated by our product stewardship group.

15            So they look at the potential for

16  increasing the risk, and they do an evaluation at not

17  only the addition of new chemicals, but an increase

18  in the level of the chemical that we already use.  So

19  all of those changes are reviewed by board certified

20  toxicologists before those changes can be implemented zi.     at tns product stage.

22       Q.       Do all Reynolds' cigarette brands contain

A.  The only ingredient that Winston contains is water.

Q.  And tobacco?

A.  Sorry. And tobacco.

Q.       Has the Surgeon General or any other public health authority taken the position that a cigarette without additives are safe to smoke?

A.  No.  They haven't taken the position that a nonadditive cigarette is safe or even safer.  All cigarettes carry with them risk.  And I haven't seen anyone say that an additive-free cigarette is any safer than an additive-containing cigarette.

Q.   You were shown the composite list of the ingredients used across Reynolds' various brands. Does Reynolds also have a section on its website where a consumer can see what ingredients are used in a particular brand?

A.  Yes.  Yes, they can.  You can click on your brand name, the particular brand style, and you can get a list of ingredients in decreasing level that's present in that particular cigarette brand.

9  cigarette.

10      Q.   And when did that reporting start to the

19      Q.   Do you know whether or not the Department

20  of Health and Human Services has ever reported to

21  Congress or anyone else that any of the cigarette

22  ingredients that Reynolds uses in its products

23  creates any additional risk to smokers?

Q.   So would HHS and the FDA know that Reynolds is using ammonia-containing products in some of its cigarette brands?

A.  Yeah, definitely.

Q.  Has FDA or the HHS ever told Reynolds you should take out ammonia-containing compounds from your brands because they're making cigarettes more

A,   No.

Q.   You were asked some questions about tobacco-specific nitrosamines, and you referenced a concept called indirect heating.  Do you recall that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you recall that?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  Will you explain what Reynolds discovered about ways to reduce tobacco-specific nitrosamines in flue-cured tobacco?

A.  Sure.  The way that the flue-cured tobacco is cured, it's picked by the leaf, it's hung in a barn and then that barn is heated, hence the term "flue-cured."

1  they used a method called direct fire.  So they would

2  have, like, a propane heat source. There would be

3  sort of an open flame and that process could

4  introduce some nitrogen-containing compounds that

5  could enhance the formation of TSNAs.

6           Reynolds' scientists did some work sort of

7  creating an indirect fire system where that heat

8  source was vented outside of the barn.  So the

9  tobacco was cured without the exposure to the

10  nitrogenous compounds that were present in the heat

11  source of the direct fire system, and the resulting

12  tobacco showed probably 90 to 95 percent reduction in

13  TSNAs compared to the direct fired system.

14           And I think if you look at, you know,

15  taking that from the tobacco source to the level in

16  cigarettes, there was a publication that came out a

17  year or so ago that looked at sort of the trend in

18  TSNA levels in first finished cigarettes over I think

19  it was a 35-year span, and you could see that that

20  level was sort of decreasing slightly. But around

21  the 2000 time frame it decreased at a much more

22  significant rate.

23           And the author was clear to point out that

24  that was probably efforts by the tobacco industry and

25  the growers to reduce the levels of TSNAs in

1  flue-cured tobacco.  So it's a very good story.

2       Q.  When Reynolds discovered that it could

3  reduce TSNAs in flue-cured tobacco, what did it do

4  with respect to the design of its product?

5       A.  Well, we switched to only using the

6  indirect fired tobaccos in our products.

7       Q.   Did that have the result of reducing the

8  TSNA content in the tobacco used in your cigarettes?

9      A.  Yeah, it significantly did.

10      Q.       Did Reynolds keep that discovery to itself,

11  or did Reynolds publish its discovery in the open

12  literature?

13      A.   Well, we did not keep it to ourself.  I do

14  believe we have a patent on the technology, but we

15  shared that information, we made presentations, we

16  published that information, we provided technologies.

17  As a matter of fact, we paid for barn conversions for

18  our growers.

19           And I think in the U.S. at this point,

20  based on that work, all of the barns that cure

21  flue-cured tobacco have been transformed into the

22  indirect fire method.

Subject Matter of Expert Testimony

Dr. Gamer will testify that R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company manufactures tobacco products, including cigarettes, smokeless tobacco, and heat-not-bum products. Today, Reynolds is an industry leader in scientific innovation and harm reduction, offering a full range of tobacco products across the risk continuum. Reynolds maintains state-of-the-art research and development facilities, staffed by scientists specializing in a number of disciplines. A key focus of Reynolds (and B&W and ATQ has been the development of methods to evaluate, understand, and reduce the inherent risk of tobacco products, including cigarettes. Reynolds (and B&W and ATQ scientists have pioneered many techniques for the evaluation and assessment of the components of tobacco and tobacco smoke.

Dr. Garner will testify that B&W and ATC followed and contributed to the body of publicly available literature on smoking and health as it developed, worked to understand the relationship between smoke constituents and the health impact of smoking, evaluated and developed chemical and biological tools to measure the contents of smoke and the health effects of smoking and changes to cigarette design that could reduce the health impact of smoking. He will testify that through research spanning many decades, ATC and B&W, like Reynolds,

4
pgNbr=139
actively engaged in fundamental research to identify and quantify the constituents in cigarette smoke. Dr. Garner will testify that ATC and B&W followed the publicly available scientific literature on smoking and health. Dr. Garner will also discuss how B&W and ATC, like Reynolds, attempted to reduce or eliminate certain constituents in smoke. In addition, he will testify about the reduction in tar and nicotine yields of commercially available cigarettes from the late 1950s to the present and that B&W and ATC provided their customers with a variety of products across a wide range of standardized machine generated "tar1* and nicotine yields. Additionally, Dr. Garner will testify that since 1980, Reynolds' scientists have published over 1,000 peer-reviewed articles, presented to external audiences on scientific topics approximately ljOOO times, and obtained over 900 patents. These publications have been cited by members of the government and public health community (including Surgeon General's reports) and address issues such as tobacco and smoke chemistry, biological activity, and toxicity: B&W and ATC followed work done by Reynolds and others in collaboration with the public health community and the government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group, to investigate and develop a less hazardous cigarette.

Dr. Gamer will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol produced during the pyrotysis of tobacco. In simple terms, cigarette smoke can be considered as biphasic because it is made up of a particulate phase and a gas/vapor phase, consisting of thousands of individual chemical compounds. The particulate phase makes up the visible portion of cigarette smoke and can be measured by entrapment on filter pads using standardized smoking machine methodologies. The vapor phase consists of gasses and volatile chemicals produced during pyrolysis. Cigarette smoke is comprised of over 7,000 chemical constituents, many of which were first identified by the work of Reynolds scientists.  There are over seventy chemicals

5
pgNbr=140
produced during the pyrolysis of tobacco that have been classified as known or potential carcinogens by various governmental and public health entities. Scientists at Reynolds (and B&W and ATQ have spent significant effort developing and implementing technologies that reduce smoke levels of carcinogens in its cigarettes as measured by standardized testing methods.

A number of different research efforts have focused on attempting to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents thought to be related to the inherent risk of smoking. While cigarette designers may have the technical goal of reducing or eliminating certain cigarette smoke constituents, they must consider a number of additional factors when designing a cigarette, including manufacturing feasibility and consumer acceptability. It is important to carefully evaluate the balance between technical success, manufacturing feasibility, and consumer acceptance. Consumer acceptance is a significant factor in designing cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risk of smoking, and scientists have worked for decades to attempt to successfully reduce the risk of a product that is acceptable to consumers. Products like carbon-fiitered cigarettes, tobacco-heating cigarettes, and cigarettes with extremely low FTC yields of V and/or nicotine may have achieved important technical milestones, but are unfortunately often not acceptable to consumers.

Attempting to reduce the inherent risk of cigarette smoking is and has been a very difficult endeavor. Many theories have been put forth over several decades that have suggested different chemicals or chemical classes (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, ciliastats, and tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs")), as well as different mechanisms of action, as the potential cause or causes of smoking-related diseases. Dr. Garner may discuss historical techniques employed to attempt to reduce the inherent risk of cigarettes, including

6
pgNbr=141
general and selective reduction. General reduction techniques work to reduce the overall yields of "tar" and nicotine as determined by standardized machine-measured methods. The theory behind general reduction is that while the individual chemical or chemicals responsible for smoking-related disease are oot known, reducing the total level of "tar" will result in a reduction of all potentially harmful constituents in tobacco. General reduction is most often accomplished by the inclusion of one or more of the following technologies in a cigarette product cellulose acetate or other filters, the incorporation of expanded, reconstituted, and other processed tobaccos, the use of more porous cigarette paper, reductions in the weight and circumference of cigarettes, and the use of filter ventilation. Dr. Garner is prepared to testify about the inclusion of general reduction technologies in Reynolds' products generally and B&W's and ATCs products specifically.

The machine measured "tar" and nicotine yields of commercial cigarettes have declined substantially since the 1950s due in large part to these general reduction techniques. Indeed, the sales-weighted machine measured V and nicotine yields of commercial cigarettes have fallen over 60% since the 1950s. The utilization of these technologies was driven, in part, by public health scientists who were encouraging cigarette manufacturers to develop cigarettes with lower "tar" and nicotine yields. Manufacturers, including B&W and ATC, responded to both the public health community and consumer demand by utilizing these general reduction techniques on existing brands as well as introducing brand family line extensions that yielded less "tar" and nicotine. In addition to discussing general reduction broadly, Dr. Garner may testify to the incorporation of general reduction techniques over time in specific cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

7
pgNbr=142
Another approach to reduce the inherent risk of cigarette smoking is called selective reduction. Selective reduction is an approach designed to target specific chemicals or chemical classes to attempt to reduce their levels as found in cigarette smoke. Selective reduction efforts focused on the scientific and public health community's various theories about which chemicals or classes of chemicals may be responsible for causing smoking-related diseases in people, which have changed over time as scientific information about cigarettes and cigarette smoke evolved. A primary challenge to developing selective reduction techniques has been that the ever-evolving theories of the scientific and public health communities have created a moving and expanding target. Despite this moving target, B&W and ATC, like Reynolds, consistently evaluated how to address each theory.

Dr. Garner may testify regarding any allegations regarding additives and/or ingredients, including menthol. Reynolds uses as few additives and ingredients as necessary to achieve the unique taste characteristics of a particular cigarette brand. In addition to being used for brand differentiation, some additives are also used in cigarettes as manufacturing aids, such as hnmectants. The use of additives does not increase the inherent risk of cigarette smoking.

Dr. Garner will testify that Reynolds has developed and maintained an extensive product stewardship program to understand and evaluate its tobacco products. Product stewardship is an evaluation of new and modified tobacco products to avoid making changes to existing tobacco products or developing new tobacco products that may increase the inherent risk associated with tobacco use. Reynolds has evaluated all of the additives and ingredients used in its tobacco products through its product stewardship program. Additionally, Reynolds does not add any additives to tobacco products to increase their inhaiability or their potential addicti veness. Reynolds and other tobacco companies have provided a list of all additives and ingredients used

3
pgNbr=143
in its cigarettes to HHS since 1986. To date, HHS has not notified Congress of any concerns about the additives or ingredients included on this list. Dr. Gamer will testify about Reynolds' work to pioneer heat-not-bum technology as a potential risk reduction including Premier and Eclipse.

A major component of Dr. Garner's work for Reynolds through RAIS is to ensure Reynolds' compliance with the Family Smoking and Tobacco Prevention Act of 2009 and the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products' rules and regulations. Since 2009, the FDA has had the authority to regulate ail aspects of Reynolds tobacco product portfolio. Among other things, the FDA oversees the manufacture, marketing, and sale of tobacco products and has the authority to mandate the removal of particular cigarette ingredients; regulate the amount of "tar" and nicotine in tobacco products (though the FDA cannot require nicotine to be completely removed); and determine what new, different, or modified risk products can be sold to consumers. To date, the FDA has not directed Reynolds to remove any of the additives it uses or reduce the nicotine in its products. The FDA's regulatory program is funded entirely by the tobacco industry.

Dr. Garner is prepared to address plaintiff's allegations regarding nicotine and nicotine manipulation, including the use of ammonia, smoke pH, and so-called "free nicotine." Reynolds does not manipulate nicotine or alter smoke pH to increase the amount of "free" nicotine in cigarettes to addict smokers. If asked, Dr. Garner may also testify about smoker "compensation" and what is known as the former FTC test method.

In addition to being prepared to testify about Reynolds' product stewardship program, Dr. Garner may offer testimony concerning Reynolds' current positions on smoking and health, statements on Reynolds' website, and Reynolds' efforts to develop smokeless tobacco products and to migrate smokers to those products. He may also testify about corporate entities such as

9
pgNbr=144
Targacept, R. J. Reynolds Vapor Co. and Niconovum, and the products sold by those entities, including electronic cigarettes (Vuse) and Qicotine replacement therapy (Zonnic). Dr. Gamer may also testify about certain publicly available financial information such as MSA payments, excise and sales taxes, manufacturer's cost, and profit per cigarette pack.

Dr. Garner may also testify in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent that it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Garner reserves the right to amend this disclosure.

Fees Dr. Garner does not charge a fee for deposition or trial testimony and receives no

additional compensation for his time spent as an expert/fact witness in litigation.
