case?

A Well, it contains the contents of this

list of materials reviewed, yes

Q And that would be all the materials that

you anticipate utilizing for your testimony in this

case, I would assume?

A No, not necessarily.  I mean, I've got,

	answer.

8
	thousands of scientific articles.  I think I provided

16
	testimony at the trial of this matter, does the CD,

	Exhibit 1, contain all those materials?
	

18
	A It contains all the materials on
	

19
	Exhibit 2, yeah.

	ask you if Exhibit 1 contained the materials in

Do you need to hear the question again,

sir?

A Yes.

Q All right.

MR. NORTON:  Madam Court Reporter, if

you'll reread

(The reporter read the requested portion

of the record.)

BY MR. NORTON:

Q Your answer, sir?

A I mean, it contains those materials.  I

just don't fully understand the question.  I just

want to clarify that, you know 

Q You don't understand that question?

A It's okay.  You know, I have  a number of questions could come up during my testimony.  I have a lot of experience.  I've read, you know, many different papers.  I don't want to limit my testimony just to these materials.  So if that's  I just want

to make sure that you understand that.

Q Well, I want to make sure you understand

the question.

to reread the question.

These are not trick questions.  I'm just

trying to lay some groundwork

MR. NORTON:  Madam Court Reporter, will

you, again, indulge the witness.

(The reporter read the requested portion

A Yes.

BY MR. NORTON

Q Thank you

And, obviously, Exhibit 2 reflects those

materials as a list, correct?

A Yes.

Q Now, with regard to your role in this

case, you have had occasion to appear as a witness 

strike that

You have had occasion to appear as a

representative and witness for PM  I will call PM Philip Morris  in the past, correct, sir?

A I've been  I've been a witness for

Philip Morris USA.  I don't recall that I've been a

representative.

BY MR. NORTON

Q So you don't call yourself a

representative; you'd call yourself a witness?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A Well, you know, I just don't know if

there's some legal meaning there when you say "representative," but I clearly, you know, have been a witness for the company Philip Morris, yes.

BY MR. NORTON

Q And as I understand it, you've only

appeared for Philip Morris in conjunction with phase

two proceedings in Engle trials.

Am I correct about that?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form

A No, you are not

BY MR. NORTON:

Q Okay.  You've appeared in other  other

than phase two proceedings?

A Yes, I have.

Q And what were those cases, if you can

recall them for me?

A Just limiting myself to trial testimony in the courtroom, and just drawing from my memory, I don't have a list in front of me.  I appeared in what

I would call the Inzerella case in New York

appeared in the Eastman case in Florida.  Appeared in Tune in Florida.  I was in the Haglund case in

Massachusetts.

I think that  and none of those were

phase two.  And then I have some other phase two

appearances

Q With regard to Engle progeny cases, have you only appeared in Florida in phase two testimony?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A Well, I mean, I've given depositions

That's testimony.  These sound like pretty legal questions, but my understanding, when I was in court for Engle cases, was that it was phase two, yes.

BY MR. NORTON:

Q You're correct.  I meant  that question was meant to ask you, have you only appeared in phase

two proceedings in trial when you've appeared in Engle progeny cases in Florida.

And I think your answer is that's correct?

A Yes, that's correct.

Q All right.  With regard to what you intend to do in this case  and I recognize that some of that has to do with what you are asked, particularly on cross-examination, but would your areas of focus and the issues that you intend to address in Buchanan be substantially similar to the issues that you addressed in other Engle phase two cases in court? MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A You know, because those were phase two, I don't want to  I think that's too narrow.  The best way to answer, I think, for me is that I have a disclosure that lays out the type of testimony that I plan to provide in the Buchanan case, and it covers a number of different issues.  And those issues have been covered, and they are substantially the same as what I had been deposed on in other Engle cases. BY MR. NORTON:

Q Well, your disclosure that you have

there  I think it is Exhibit 3  is detailed in

the Buchanan case.

Is that a substantially similar disclosure as to other Engle phase two cases you testified in in

Florida?

A Yes, it is

MR. SEXTON:  Bill, this is Terry.  Just to streamline and maybe to help you out, we do reserve the right to call Dr. Lipowicz in either a phase one or phase two, but we do expect his testimony to be substantially similar to the other testimony he's given in Engle.  And as Dr. Lipowicz just affirmed, this is the same disclosure he's used in his prior cases.

So to the extent that gives you additional assurance about the predictability of his testimony,

there you go

MR. NORTON:  All right

2
	A Well, I  just to clarify, that was never

	a name of the department that I'm in.  The department
	

4
	I'm in is called tobacco regulatory and health

6
	Q And you've been in that department at
	

7
	Altria for how long?
	

8
	A That department is actually relatively
	

9
	new, so I've been in that department for several
	

10

Q What is that product?
	

A Marlboro Snus.
	

Q When you say "occasionally," how often do
	

you use Marlboro Snus?
	

A Infrequently.  I think I've used, you
	

know, a pack in the last week and maybe two packs 
	

a few packs in the last few months.
	

Q And for how long a period of time have you
	

been using some sort of tobacco product?
	

I know you quit smoking, but I'm trying to
	

figure out how long you've been using other tobacco
	

products.
	

A I think since it came out in 2006,
	

Marlboro Snus, I've used it, you know, a number of
	

times.  Like I said, it's an occasional use, but back
	

to about 2006.
	

Q And was that when you quit smoking?
	

A  I quit smoking in 2002.
	

Q Between 2002 and 2006, did you use any
	

type of tobacco products or nicotine replacement
	

products whatsoever?
	

A Yes, I had.

Q What were they?

And give me the dates, if you can.

A Well, I used some nicotine replacement products, including nicotine gum, nicotine lozenges. I might have smoked an occasional cigarette, talking about once a year, just to try something, but really,

it was nicotine replacement products.

Q Would you say that you used nicotine

replacement products, either nicotine gum or lozenges, on a regular basis between 2002 and 2006?

A Yes

Q And in  you said also in the 2002 to

2006 time frame, you would occasionally smoke a

cigarette?

A Well, you know, there's  a couple of puffs on a newer product.  I wouldn't really call myself a smoker there.  I can't say I absolutely didn't have a cigarette.  Now that I think about it, I may have had, you know, parts of a cigar from time

to time, you know, once or twice a year.

Q With regard to the cigarette smoking

between 2002 and 2006, is it your testimony that on

occasion, you would smoke an entire cigarette?

A No.  I don't recall doing that, but, you know, I certainly wasn't taking note of it at the time.  I just don't recall that I  I might have smoked a few puffs of a cigarette, really, but I don't remember smoking a whole cigarette.

Q In the 2002/2006 time frame, when you did smoke a cigarette at least partially, was that only to try a new product, or were there other occasions

where you smoked part of a cigarette?

A As I recall, it's only to try something

new.  You know, we  for example, I think we had marketed Marlboro UltraSmooth at that time, and I

certainly wanted to try that.  Yeah, that's my

recollection, it was only for a new product.

Q And between  I'm sorry, in 2006 and

using the Marlboro Smooth; is that correct?

A Yes

Q And 

A Let me clarify.  In 2006, there was no

Marlboro Snus.  It was a different product called

Taboka, but it was a similar product.

Q So in 2006, you began using a product

similar to Marlboro Snus, and when Marlboro Snus came

out, you switched to them, correct?

A That's kind of implies a little more

regular use, I think, than I really had.  When Marlboro Snus came out, I used that.  Before that, I used some Taboka, but it was all Snus, smokeless

product.

Q So in the last week you've smoked 

utilized a pack of Marlboro Snus, correct?

A I think it was maybe a little bit  maybe

a pack and a half

today?

A It's irregular.  There were some times

when I used it  used them every day and periods

where I didn't use it for months in a row.  I

certainly was not a regular user the whole time, but, you know, looking back, it's hard for me to give you a number.  There were times I used maybe as much as a pack, that's six different Snus in a day, and then

months I didn't have any.

Q Why would you at times smoke a pack  up to a pack  utilize up to a pack and a half of Snus  Marlboro Snus in a week and at other times, as your testimony says, go months in a row without

utilizing any Snus?

A I mean, I don't think I have any

particular scientific reason for it.  It's just  Q I didn't ask for a specific scientific, emotional, physiologic, psychological reason.  I just

asked for why you did that

MR. SEXTON:  Go ahead and finish your

answer.

A You know, it's a product, and I can sort of use it as I choose.  When I didn't want to use it, I didn't.  That's really my only answer for you.  I

Snus?

Q What would make you personally choose to

use more Snus at times and then at other times, as

you say, not use any?

With regard to materials generated in the Buchanan case that are case specific to the Buchanan case, have you reviewed any such materials other than such things as notice of taking deposition?

A No.

MR. SEXTON:  Bill, this is Terry.  Just for purposes of streamlining this, I'll let you know that the only case-specific information that we would intend to get into with Dr. Lipowicz at the trial of this case would be the brands that plaintiff smoked and the time period in which he smoked them.

Other than that  as with his prior testimony, Dr. Lipowicz will not be coming in and testifying about whether Mr. Buchanan was addicted or not, what disease he had, what caused it, those sorts of things.  He doesn't get into that.  So the only case-specific testimony he'11 give would concern plaintiff's smoking history as it pertains to Philip Morris' products.

Q Now, Doctor, having had that clarification from counsel  and I thank you, Terry  what is your understanding of the brands that Mr. Buchanan smoked, and if you can weave into your answer the time frames for which he smoked those brands? What

is your understanding of that?

A Well, I understand that he smoked

Chesterfield cigarettes in the 1950s, starting there. Then at some time, he smoked L&M cigarettes. I don't know exactly when he started that. This is just what I've been told.  Then started to smoke Marlboro Light

cigarettes from Philip Morris in 1974

Q When did Marlboro Lights come out?

A It came out in 1971.

Q And the Chesterfields that it's your understanding he smoked in the '50s were unfiltered?

A You know, I don't really know what they

were.  I just know they were Chesterfields

Q And with regard to the brands he smoked,

is there any significance to you as to the brands he smoked and when he smoked them with regard to the testimony and issues that you plan to address at the

trial of this matter?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A You know, I know  I plan on  I know he smoked Marlboro Lights from '74 on.  That's a lower tar cigarette.  That's, I think  I'm going to testify about cigarettes, that's what I would be

largely limited to.

that.

Q I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last part of

A I'm going to testify about what he smoked

I think  you know, my understanding is he smoked Marlboro Lights, and, you know, my testimony may

include information about that cigarette.

Q Was it your understanding that he smoked

Marlboros before he went to Marlboro Lights?

A No

Q With regard to the Marlboro Lights, were

Marlboro Lights a cigarette that was marketed by Philip Morris as a cigarette with reduced tar yields?

A Yes.

Q Marketed as a healthier cigarette, if you

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A No, that's not  you know, I agree that it had reduced tar yields and that was represented, but not that  don't agree that it was ever represented by the company as a healthier cigarette

BY MR. NORTON:

Q How was it represented by Philip Morris

that Marlboro Lights had lower tar yields?

Was that in their advertisements?

A Well, there are requirements set forth by

the Federal Trade Commission for measurement of tar

and nicotine, and those numbers were  at times have been on the pack of cigarettes, and also, I think, for Marlboro Lights, they've always been on any

advertisement for cigarettes.

Q At the point in time that Philip Morris was indicating that Marlboro Lights had a lower tar yield, is it your understanding that, in general, the public had an understanding that a lower tar cigarette would be better for them than a cigarette

with more tar?

Q It would have been easier if I had done

that that way in the beginning.

Do you have  does it make logical sense to you, Doctor, that if Philip Morris was marketing information on Marlboro Lights, that they had a lower tar yield, that the public would think that it would

Q Do you have any opinions for me as to why Philip Morris began to market information on Marlboro Lights that included information that it was a lower

tar yield cigarette?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form

A No, I don't.

BY MR. NORTON:

Q Logically, does it make sense to you that Philip Morris may have marketed that Marlboro Lights with information that they were a lower tar yield cigarette in an effort to inform the public that it

was a healthier cigarette?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

Bill, you continue to use the word

"markets," and I think the witness has clearly identified for you that the FTC required those disclosures.  So I want to object to the use of your

term "markets.

But subject to that objection, Doctor, if

you can answer his question, please do so.

BY MR. NORTON:

Q If you have no opinion, you can say, I

have no opinion on that, that's fine

A I think I, in effect, said that

Q All right.  Now, other than the

requirement to put tar yields on cigarettes, are you aware of Philip Morris, with regard to Marlboro Lights, marketing them with the concept that they

were a lower tar yield cigarette'

A I mean, in a general sense, yeah, I think

it was represented as a lower tar yield cigarette,

yes

Q And that was in their marketing and on the

box itself, right?

A You know, I'm just trying to remember and really not  not here really so much to talk about marketing.  I do agree that it was represented as a

lower tar cigarette, yes.

Q Your understanding is that was mandatory

from the government?

Q Do you also  I think you said, and

correct me if I'm wrong, that you understood that, independent of government-required marking on the box of tar yields, that Marlboro Lights were represented to the public, in general, as a lower tar yield

cigarette

Am I correct about that?

A Yes.

Q Now, do you intend to discuss with the

jury the concept of lower tar yield cigarettes in general or focus on Marlboro Lights specifically?

I'm trying to find out what it is that you

plan on talking to the jury about with regard to

Marlboro Lights.

effective cigarette smoke constituents, efforts toward general reduction of tar and nicotine, and selective reduction of smoke constituents.  Those are areas I'11 talk about with respect to cigarette design, and, you know, I can apply some of those to

Marlboro Lights as well

Q What design features do you intend to

discuss with respect to the Marlboro Lights?

A Well, I'll talk about design features that make cigarettes lower tar.  I'll talk about features such as expanded tobacco, reconstituted leaf, porous paper, filter ventilation, filters, in general, filter efficiency.  And, you know, that's  as I sit here today, those are the types of design features that I'11 talk about.

Q Are there any other design features you intend to discuss with the jury other than those that

you've just given me a list?

And I appreciate that.

Q I have read a deposition given in, I

think, the Huish case that was, I want to say, February of 2011 where your depo was taken by one of

my partners, Mr. Sales.

Do you recall generally that deposition

being taken?

I'm not asking you everything in it

A Yes, I do

Q Since that time, has there been any

products developed by Philip Morris or any of its subsidiaries or what have you that would fall into the category of products, the subject of which would be harm reduction, in general, as a broad category?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form

A Well, we have introduced products since

that time, and many of those products are lower tar products.  So they fall generally within the type of products I could talk about.  There haven't been any

products, you know, for example, with activated charcoal that were introduced since that time.

BY MR. NORTON: Q I'm a little confused.  I was looking at the time frame  I thought Mr. Sales did a good job  we won't tell him that.  I thought Mr. Sales did a good job of going over the products that had been developed at Philip Morris, the subject of which would be, broadly speaking, harm reduction.

And I wanted to know, since February of 2011, have there been any other such products developed, or are there any such products in development at Philip Morris?

I know that's a compound question.

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form. A And the answer is, you know, sort of very generally, that I think lower tar products meet that definition, and, you know, we continue to work on trying to reduce the risk of cigarettes and have projects ongoing for that.  But since February this year, there haven't been any products that are a very different nature from some typical cigarettes or

conventional cigarettes such as activated charcoal.

So I'm trying to answer your question. I think I've done a pretty good job. The idea of what you mean by "reduce harm," you know, I will include, you know, our lower tar cigarettes in that category.

BY MR. NORTON

Q Well, since 2011, have there been any new lower tar cigarettes introduced by Philip Morris?

A All of our cigarettes are lower tar relative to, you know, certainly what tar had been in the past.  You know, I don't really have  I can't list them for you right now.  I know we've introduced

some new products.

Q Is it appropriate for Philip Morris to try

to reduce nicotine levels in their cigarette

products?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form

A Well, it's something that, you know, we've

had projects to do.  We've actually had a product that did do that, De-nik product (phonetic).  So,

yeah, I would say that when we did it, it's

appropriate.

BY MR. NORTON: Q Is it a goal of Philip Morris to try to reduce nicotine in their cigarettes?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form. A Well, the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, as we are now regulated by the FDA, is something that is really the FDA's determination. You know, Philip Morris makes cigarettes from tobacco.  Tobacco contains nicotine.  You know, that's really unlikely to change, and so we expect that cigarettes, you know, will contain nicotine.

see.

Morris does with nicotine in cigarettes.  So, you

Q Does Philip Morris have a continuing, ongoing goal to reduce nicotine in its cigarettes?

Yes or no?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form. A You know, we've lowered our tar and nicotine in cigarette.  I think, historically, there has been reductions in nicotine, and I think we are  if you look at our product introductions, we don't introduce products at the same tar and nicotine levels that we did that were out there 50 to 60 years ago.  So I think, historically, you know, we have had a goal of lowering tar, lowering nicotine, yeah.

BY MR. NORTON: Q Okay.  Just so you understand the question, Doctor, I wasn't asking you on a historical basis.  I appreciate what you just told me on the history of tar and nicotine in Philip Morris' cigarette products.

My question to you, sir, is  and we can start in 2010, if you would like.

Starting in 2010 and going on into the future, is it an ongoing goal of Philip Morris to

reduce nicotine levels in their cigarette products?

Yes or no?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A Well, you know, I think I've answered that because we have had  as we introduce lower tar and

nicotine cigarettes and done that historically  that is what our brands are today, lower tar and nicotine, and that is really not something that I

anticipate is going to change.

So that's the answer that I can provide to

you.  If you want to have some more specificity to your question, I can maybe provide you more details

I think I've given the answer that I can

BY MR. NORTON:

Q Well, you just went back again to a

historic look at tar and nicotine levels.  My

question deals with nicotine, so that we're very

clear

Has Philip Morris, since 2010, been making

ongoing efforts to try to reduce the nicotine levels

in its cigarettes?

respectfully, sir.  You haven't even attempted to

argumentative.  There's no need for that.  I think Dr. Lipowicz has done his best to answer your

question

MR. NORTON:  And it has not even been

close to being answered. The only reason I said that was because there was colloquy from the witness about how well he's done answering the question that

right back.

Q The question, Doctor, so that we're clear,

not looking at the historical reduction in tar or nicotine, I'm talking about in 2010 forward, is Philip Morris trying to reduce the nicotine in its

cigarette products?

It seems a pretty simple question?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A Well, and I've answered it. If we'd like, we can read back the answers. The court reporter can read back all of my answer on that question.

BY MR. NORTON

Q I don't need to hear your answers where

you evade the question.  I don't want to go back through that.  I know what you've said on the record, and I don't really want to take this to the Court and do all that stuff, but you're leaving me really with

no alternative

Can you name, Doctor, any Philip Morris'

cigarettes that have reduced the nicotine in them

from 2010 forward?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A Yeah.  Marlboro Gold, Marlboro Silver,

Merit, Bronze.  You know, really just essentially our entire portfolio.  Most of the products in our  that we sell are reduced tar, reduced nicotine, certainly relative to what was on the market when Philip Morris began, you know, these low tar efforts

in the 1950s

BY MR. NORTON:

Q I didn't ask you about the 1950s.

Doctor, just so we're very clear, because I want to be very clear for your counsel and, obviously, for the Court, since 2010, Doctor  not 50 years ago  since 2010, has Philip Morris reduced the level of nicotine in any of its cigarette

products?

MR. SEXTON:  Bill, just so the question is

clear, are you asking whether the brands that

Dr. Lipowicz mentioned, such as Marlboro Gold or Marlboro Bronze, have lowered their levels since 2010?  That is, are the levels in the cigarettes

today lower than they were in 2010?

MR. NORTON:  It's a broader question than that.  It didn't limit it to those particular brands

I said, since 2010, has Philip Morris lowered the level of nicotine in any of its cigarette products.

MR. SEXTON:  So from 2010 forward, in any brand, has Philip Morris reduced the level of nicotine in that brand to a level lower than what it was pre-2010?  Okay.

MR. NORTON:  No, not pre-2010. BY MR. NORTON: Q Here's the question.  Doctor, there are certain levels of nicotine in all of Philip Morris' cigarettes, correct? A Yes.

Q The company knows what those levels are at any given point in time, correct?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form. A That's not correct.

BY MR. NORTON: Q Why not?

A Well, we don't test every cigarette that we make.

Q Okay.

A We test

Q In general  I understand you don't test

In general, Philip Morris would know the

nicotine level of any of its brand of cigarettes,

correct?

A Yes.  We would know the levels from the

Cambridge filter testing, yes, we would.

Q All right.  And you would know  if I gave you a brand and said, In 2010, what would be the level of nicotine in a given brand, you could go look up that material and tell me the answer, correct?

A That's correct

Q All right.  The question is, since 2010, with regard to any brand of Philip Morris' cigarettes, has Philip Morris reduced intentionally the level of nicotine in any of their cigarettes?

A Well, the answer is that the  we make cigarettes the same way we did in 2010.  I think that's part of also our FDA regulation, you know, just so  I think cigarettes today are substantially the same and equivalent to what they were in 2010. No  you know, no change in  no expected change in

tar or nicotine levels.

cigarettes, correct'

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A Well, yeah.  I mean, you know, I can't

speak to every single brand, but I think the answer

that I gave is correct, yes.

BY MR. NORTON

Q All right.  Let me ask you another

question.

Is it your testimony that the FDA

regulates Philip Morris in a way that it dictates what the nicotine and tar levels have to be in Philip

Morris's cigarettes?

A You know, I  in a sense, yes

Q In a sense or

A In a sense, yes.  It's not a specific part of the regulation.  The FDA does have authority over

what those levels are.  They have made rules that essentially require cigarettes to be unchanged, you know, from what they were February 15th, 2007.  So yes, they have regulation over the tar and nicotine. BY MR. NORTON:

Q Does the FDA dictate the exact levels of nicotine or tar in the Philip Morris' cigarettes?

A Well, I wouldn't  I wouldn't put it that way.  Not to the sense that we get a letter saying, This brand must be this, but by requiring that the cigarettes be the same as they were on February 15th, 2007, they in a sense do, in fact, do just that.  We need to make the cigarettes that were on the market several years ago  the same way that we made them then, we have to make them today.

Q Other than the requirements by the FDA that Philip Morris' cigarettes remain unchanged as to nicotine and tar from the levels that were in their cigarettes in February 15 of 2007, does the FDA dictate what the levels of tar and nicotine should

be?

A Well, I don't see where there's anything

left in the "other than" category that is comprehensive.  FDA regulates every new product introduction, and so every time we introduce a new cigarette product, we provide the FDA advanced notice, and they have to authorize the introduction So  and for whatever reason, you know, it's up to them as to whether they decide or not.  They have complete regulatory control of Philip Morris.

"other than" exclusion of what the FDA regulates. BY MR. NORTON:

Q Doctor, the FDA doesn't tell Philip Morris what the nicotine levels has to be in its cigarettes other than it has to comply with the nicotine levels of February 15, 2007, correct?

A No, that's not correct.  I think, there's also  for any new product that we introduce that was not on the market February 15th, 2007, the FDA needs to authorize the introduction of that product. In order to authorize that, we have to provide information to the FDA.  How they decide on their authorization is not  that's something that they do, and certainly, tar and nicotine levels are something that they can be looking at.

So they have a broad authority to regulate tar and nicotine levels. So  like I said, we don't get a letter from them saying, This must be this, but their regulation gives them the authority, and they exercise that authority to essentially determine what our products are.

Q As to current products that Philip Morris

manufactures, cigarette products, the FDA does not have a specific requirement for tar or nicotine levels other than that it should be unchanged from the February 15th, 2007 levels, correct?

A I mean, that's  that covers just about everything, but to the extent that we have to do new products, they can review those applications and decide  for example, if somehow we were to make a product and it had some tar level that they didn't like, I think it's within their jurisdiction to maybe not authorize that product.

So I think that they have  they don't necessarily tell us what it can be, but on the other hand, they can refuse to authorize products that we make in a sense they regulate what the levels are in our products.

Q As to any new products that Philip Morris comes out with, we can't sit here and say whether the FDA will or will not approve them?

That's in the future, no one knows, right?

A No.  That's already in the  in the present.  Right now we have applications with the FDA

Q All right.  Currently, you could put out a product that had  if those were the right ranges in 2007, you could put out a cigarette product  Philip Morris could  with tar between 1 milligram and 18 milligrams and nicotine between .1 milligram and 1.2 milligrams, correct?

A No.

Q Why not?

A Because there's other requirements.

Q Okay.  If it meets the  otherwise meets the other requirements  with regard to the requirements for tar and nicotine, Philip Morris put out a cigarette with tar, if these levels are correct  and we're using hypothetical levels  put out a cigarette with tar levels of 1 milligram to 18 milligrams and nicotine of .1 milligram to 1.2 milligrams, correct?

A Look, you said a lot there

BY MR. NORTON:

Q  I did.

A I think you've got a back- 

misunderstand what the FDA's regulation is about.  I provided you with a range of tar and a range of

nicotine.

Q Right.

A The FDA has not said that anything in that range is okay.  They've not said that.  They simply say that your products have to be like they were

February 15th, 2007

So to the extent that you want to

extrapolate from this range to say that the FDA has somehow approved anything in that range, I cannot accept that as a basis of any reasonable assumption

of what the FDA is about

Q All right.  You would know and be able to tell us what the tar and nicotine values were for any of Philip Morris's cigarettes in general  not individual cigarettes  as of February 15th, 2007

manufacture dates, correct?

A  Yes.

Q And the FDA said you can go forward with

cigarettes that are unchanged from those types of cigarettes you were making in February of 2007,

correct?

A Yes

Q And since 2009, when they came out with

this rule, the FDA has not dictated to Philip Morris or any cigarette company exact levels of nicotine or tar to have in their cigarettes, correct?

A Well, they have not provided and said,

Your cigarettes need to be this, but they do have the authority to not authorize cigarettes.  Certainly, tar and nicotine levels in those cigarettes would be one of the things they could look at.

Q All right.  So it's your understanding, Doctor, that after June 22nd, 2009 up until today, the FDA could  per your understanding, could come out and say, Philip Morris, we do not want you to produce any cigarettes with a tar level above X and a nicotine level above Y?

They could do that, that's your

understanding?

A Well, that's the law.  Yes, they can. They could actually set product standards that would actually apply to current products and could change tar and nicotine levels in those products.  They have

not done so

Q That was my point.

They haven't done that to date, correct?

A That's correct.

Q And as long as you don't exceed  Philip

Morris doesn't exceed the tar and nicotine levels of the 2007 cigarettes that Philip Morris was making, Philip Morris could actually reduce the tar levels and reduce the nicotine levels if they desired to do

so, correct?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form

A That's not correct

BY MR. NORTON

Q Why not?

A Because these cigarettes that we make have to be substantially equivalent to the cigarettes that we made.  I don't understand everything about what

that means, but essentially what it means is they need to be made in the same way, with the same ingredients, with the same tobacco, with the same cigarette design, with the same filters, with the same paper, with the same kind of ventilation, everything about them being the same.  When you make a cigarette the same way, you will get the same tar

and nicotine.

Q So the FDA requirement of substantially equivalent to the 2007 cigarette, it's your understanding that Philip Morris could not make a substantially similar equivalent cigarette and merely reduce the tar and nicotine because that would be not

in compliance with the FDA rule of 2009?

Is that your understanding?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form

A Well, you know, I can't  I mean,

essentially it is, yes, that when you make changes in a cigarette that result in changes to tar up or down, changes to nicotine up or down, then those changes may not be viewed as being substantially equivalent and therefore could run afoul of FDA regulations.

BY MR. NORTON: Q So you think if Philip Morris came out with a cigarette tomorrow that was substantially equivalent to the cigarettes it was making in February of 2007 except for one detail, that is that they reduced significantly the nicotine level, you think that that would be disapproved and run afoul of the FDA rule of 2009?

Is that your testimony?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form, misstates the

witness's testimony.  Also an improper hypothetical

Go ahead

A It's hard to predict what the FDA will do. They have the regulatory authority.  They have the ability to make these judgments.  But within the law, as I understand it and the way that the company's

applying it, the cigarettes are  to be

substantially equivalent, they need to be essentially unchanged.  So I can't see how significant reductions in constituents such as nicotine, tar, or anything else could be achieved without making significant changes in the cigarettes.  Therefore, it seems to me

that it would not meet with FDA approval.

BY MR. NORTON: Q  So in your words  in your understanding, Doctor, substantially equivalent means substantially equivalent in tar and nicotine levels, too?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form, misstates the witness's testimony.

A No.  Substantially equivalent has  you know, I'm not  substantially equivalent means just that, substantially equivalent, so what I've said before, it's made the same way, made with tobacco, made with the same cigarette design.  I can't see how a substantially equivalent cigarette could have a remarkably different tar and nicotine level and still be substantially equivalent.

BY MR. NORTON: Q Let me see if I can do some  a little bit of housekeeping.

There was a lot of discussion during your deposition in February of 2011 in the Huish case about graphic representations, company warnings on cigarettes.

implicated  excuse me, any of those graphic images

for the warnings been implemented to date?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A Well, they are not on packs to date.

That's not the regulation.  In fact, the FDA just a couple of days ago announced which nine graphic warnings they will require on packs starting in the

BY MR. NORTON:

Q Have you reviewed those graphic warnings

that are going on packs in the fall of 2012?

A You know, not in detail.  I did watch some

of the press conference.  I have seen some of the warnings, read about them, but I haven't really

studied them in detail.

warnings based on the size of the warning or the

A The company has made comments to the FDA about how these warnings can be implemented.  I am not aware that the company has objected to any specific graphic warning. BY MR. NORTON:

Q Didn't you testify that the company did have some comments about the size and location of some of the graphic warnings?

A Well, yeah  I think that's part of the implementation and, you know, just  it is the company's job  Philip Morris's job to actually implement these warnings, to actually put them on the packs.  So we had some very practical comments from the FDA as to, Could you make them a certain aspect ratio, give us time to allow for the packs to be printed, give us a practical way to rotate the graphic warnings.  That was part of our comments.  I think we also did comment relative to the size.

Q What were the company's comments regarding

the size?

Q I'm sorry?  Let's go back over that again

The question pending, sir, is, what

questions or comments did the company have about the

size of the warnings proposed?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.  That was

just asked and answered

Try again, Doctor

A I think with regard to the size, the

company made comments to the FDA with respect to the size and whether the size did  was, you know, adequate within our rights in terms of the constitution, but that's  you know, those are the

kinds of comments we made about the size

time ago.  I can't really reiterate them to you in any detail.  That's my understanding of the comments

and what we said about the size.

Q Did they say it was too big?  Too small?

What?

A I'm not  I don't remember exactly how it was put, but we raised questions about the size and whether it was something that was, you know, really within the law and the constitution to have a size

like that.

Q Was it your understanding, without

remembering the specific comments on size, that they dealt with the company's feeling that the size of the

warning was too big for whatever reason?

A I think generally, you know, that's

correct, but as  I wouldn't  I don't think we

ever said it in that way.

Q Well, if you're going to tell me, We

didn't say it that way, I want to know how you said it.  Either you know or you don't know, because

earlier you told me, I don't remember

A I just said I don't know that we said it

that way.

Q But it did relate to the size of the

warning being too big?

A In a general sense, yes, but I don't know exactly how we  I can't recall exactly what our comments were, but I think in a general sense, yes, we were saying that, you know, 50 percent  that we certainly recognize that's a very large warning, and we spoke to the  you know, whether that was, you know, a lawful requirement given protections of the constitution.

Q Would you agree that, in general, the larger the warning, the more effective it could be?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form, lacks foundation, completely outside this witness's

expertise.

If you want to guess at that, go ahead,

BY MR. NORTON

Q Sorry, what was the answer?

First to state, I'm really no expert in

warnings.  I think it stands to reason that a warning that is incredibly small is not effective.  I don't

Q Do you know  other than the requirements in the fall of 2012 from the FDA concerning the warnings that we've just touched on, is there any other expected regulation of the company's business, either Altria or Philip Morris USA, in the near future, as far as you know?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A Well, there's ongoing regulation by the FDA, and they can make rules at any time.  They're contemplating rules on menthol as we speak.  They are prepared to inspect our factories, our manufacturing plants and those of other companies.  So there's a comprehensive set of rules that are in place from the FDA.  There's a constant dialog between the company and the FDA with respect to those.  For example, they can continue and have continued to make document requests to us.

answered.

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form, asked and

Go ahead. A I answered that question.  It's an ongoing regulation.  There are a number of points of regulation.  Inspection is part of the regulation. Document requests are part of the regulation.  Those are ongoing.  Those are happening as we speak.  So it's not a matter of simply there's just one thing going on in 2012.  There are pesticide regulations

coming forth.

I don't know the timing of every single

regulation, but there are a number of things

happening.  The headlines are certainly around these graphic warnings, but we are in  you know, constantly being regulated by the FDA and things are happening on a weekly and even daily basis.

You know, there's maybe new issues that come up in this trial from either your experts or as it relates to Mr. Buchanan and his smoking history.  So I just want to reserve the right to, you know, talk about those things. BY MR. NORTON:

Q Is there anything about Mr. Buchanan's smoking history that you think is significant in terms of what you plan to address with the jury in the Buchanan case?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A I don't know if it's significan-  the fact that he's  I think it's important to know what brand he smoked in the sense that questions may come up about that brand.  That's really what I plan to address.

Q Why is it significant what brands he smoked  I'm not following that  for purposes of

your testimony?

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

A I didn't say necessarily that it was significant, but I know that that's one of the reasons  you know, he smoked a Philip Morris brand, and I think that's why Philip Morris is in this case. We've applied low tar technologies to Marlboro Light, and the jury may be interested in how we did that. BY MR. NORTON:

Q What were the technologies employed to lower tar in Marlboro Lights?

A Well, it's a full range of technologies that we have, including higher efficiency filtration, filler ventilation, expanded tobacco, reconstituted leaf, some porous paper, and also just less tobacco in the cigarette.  And those are actually  you know, the cigarette, of course, evolved over time during the time that Mr. Buchanan smoked, and, of course, many of these features also apply to other Philip Morris' cigarettes.

Q Any other technologies that you intend to address with regard to any of the Philip Morris'

your answer

MR. SEXTON:  Object to form.

Doctor, I'm instructing you not to answer this question to the extent that it requires you to divulge conversations that you've had with attorneys of the company or attorneys who represent the company

in litigation

Apart from those conversations that you

may have with lawyers for the company, if you had conversations with others at the company where they evaluate your testimony, you can go ahead and do

that

A Subject to that, there's been no

evaluation.

PHILIP MORRIS USA AND PETER J. LIPOWICZ, PH.D

BY MR. SEXTON

Q You were asked some questions earlier

about the reasons why brands with lower tar like

Marlboro Lights were initially introduced

Do you recall those questions?

A Yes, I do.

Q Are you generally aware of efforts by the federal government and the public health community over time to persuade Philip Morris and other tobacco manufacturers to lower the tar yields of their

cigarettes?

A Yes.  I mean, there were significant

efforts.  Public health had  Surgeon General had certainly made those suggestions.  Scientists said that lower tar was the way to reduce risk, and Philip Morris did respond by making lower tar products.

Q And was the introduction of Marlboro

Lights one of Philip Morris's efforts to comply with

MR. SEXTON:  I think that's all I've got

for you right now.  Thank you, Doctor

FURTHER EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR THE PLAINTIFFS

BY MR. NORTON:

Q At the time, Doctor, that Philip Morris lowered the tar in Marlboro Lights, were they under government compulsion to do so, or is it your

testimony that was voluntary?

A Well, it was voluntary.  It was not a law

that said we had to do it, but there were 

certainly, public health was suggesting that it be done, was asking that it be done, but it wasn't mandated.  So I guess, to your point, it was

voluntary

further.

Anybody else?
