1         Q   Okay.  When did the Brown & Williamson Tobacco f

2    Company and the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company merge?

3         A   In 2004.                                                                                      \

4         Q   And did R.J. Reynolds take over the operations 1

5    of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company?

6         A    The way I understand it, it was decided that

7    the operations and the manufacturing would be run in

8    Winston-Salem, after that merger, and so all the Brown & \

9    Williamson headquarters and facilities were wound down   f

10    in roughly about a 12- to 16-month period, something

11    like that.                                                                                                        j

12         Q   And did R.J. Reynolds continue to manufacture  f

13    and sell the cigarette brands that the Brown &                         f

14    Williamson Corporation was selling at the time of the   f

15    merger?

	A   Internal business records, it's hard to put a

	number on it.  My reliance list is over a thousand      f

6
	documents long, those are not all internal records

7

8

9
	time, internal documents.                            jj

10
	Q   And in the thousands of documents that you've  f

11

	Dr. Eman?                                         \

14
	looked for one either, so I suppose I could � I suppose j

15
	I could search, but I have not.

17
	designated as the recipient or somebody who was CCed on  |

18
	a document?

19
	A   I believe I have, but, you know, I'd have to  |

	go and look and check that.                           \

22
	A   No, not that � no.  And his name doesn't

	A   It would be fairly bland, maybe a little      \

5
	taste good to a consumer.

9

3    testify in trial this year?

4        A    More than that.

5         Q    And then approximately how many trials have

6    you participated in since 2008?

7        A    I think my first trial was in 2009, I think

8    I've been in � I think I've testified 20 � 20 times.

9         Q   And in getting yourself prepared for either

10    depositions or trials, you have met with attorneys for

11    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

12         A   I have, yes.  Certainly in the past I have,

13    but we certainly meet, yeah.

14         Q   And do you remember testifying in the Hughes

15    case, California?

16         A   I have not testified in that case.

17         Q   By deposition.

18        A   A deposition is not completed yet, but I did

19    begin a deposition in the Hughes and Majors case.

20         Q   Okay.  Do you recall testifying in the Hughes

21    case that you have � you would approximate the hours

22    that you have spent meeting with lawyers over the years

23    in preparation for other depositions for trial in the

24    hundreds of hours?

w

25         A   Yeah, I can't remember if that's what I said | ^J

1    or not, but it sounds reasonable.  That's -- over the

2    years i  would say that's probably reasonable, yeah.

3         Q   Okay.  Because you don't specifically track

4    the number of hours that you sit down and meet with a

6         A    I do not, no.

7         Q   So when you gave an estimate, it would be

8    reasonable that you have spent hundreds of hours, that

9    was your best estimate of the time that you spent

10    working with attorneys getting ready for either

11    deposition or trial in the work that you do for R.J.

12    Reynolds?

13         A   I represent R.J. Reynolds, so, yeah, we

14    certainly take litigation seriously, so I do prepare.

15    The bulk of the time I spent with lawyers would have

16    been in 2008 where I met with them on a weekly basis to

17    really learn the history of Reynolds.  So from a

18    case-specific perspective we don't spend very much time

19    getting ready for depositions or trial anymore with Z\)         the ~*~~ with some exceptions .

21         Q   My question was, in testifying that it would

22    be reasonable to estimate that you have spent into the

2
	A
	In total, yes, I would say so.

3
	Q
	And then there's also time spent obviously

H.
	actually
	in usposiLion as well as in trial, correct.     i

5
	A
	There is, yes.

6
	Q
	Okay.  And, typically, how long do your

7
	depositions last on average?                          \
	
8
	/\
	You know, it depends on -- you know, it's not  j

9
	my deposition so it's really on the plaintiff's attorney |
	
10
	to make
	the determination how long they want to spend,

11
	so it's
	hard to say.

12
	Q
	Okay.                                      |

13
	A
	Some of them last, you know, more than a full

14
	eight-hour day, some of them last 45 minutes, so it's � j
	
15
	it's qui
	te variable.                                j

16
	Q
	My question was, though, do you have an       j

17
	estimate
	as to what the average number of hours is that

18
	you have
	testified in deposition?                     |

19
	c\
	Oh, I don't have that estimate, no.          j

20
	Q
	You would expect -- strike that.

21
	
	Would a reasonable estimate be into the       I

22
	hundreds
	of hours, if you had given 45 depositions since j

23
	2008?
	

24

	I mean, I would think so, I just really have

25   never th
		ought about it, but, you know, I would say so.   \

1
	I mean, they certainly last an hour and I've done about

2
	45 of them, so it's probably not unreasonable to think

3
	that there's hundreds of hours there.  But I never      j

4
	really bothered to count it up or think about that.

5
	Q   Okay.  And in the testimony that you have

6
	given actually at trial in the 20-plus trials that you

7
	estimate that you've given, you probably will be into at \

8
	least over a hundred hours of trial testimony, correct,

9
	if you've done that 20 times?

10
	A   Again, I don't know.  I never really thought

11
	about it.  It could be � it could be a hundred hours,

12
	it could be over a hundred hours, it could be a little  j

13
	less.  I haven't really thought about it.  I mean,

14
	sometimes I only go on the stand for, you know, like a

15
	two- or three-hour period, so it's hard to say.         j

16
	Q   So either between - either testifying in

17
	deposition or trial or preparing with attorneys to

18
	testify in deposition or trial, you have devoted many   \

19
	hundreds of hours for that type of work that you do on

20
	behalf of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, correct?

21
	A   Again, I don't characterize it as work, it's

22
	something I chose to do.  It's not part of my job

23
	description, but in that sense, yes, I'm an experienced j

24
	witness, I've spent many hours doing this, so, yes.

25        Q   And how many attorneys do you think that you  |

	A   Why was I?

	And to be frank, most of the time, the same sets of

2         Q   Have you met with any R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

3    Company employees other than attorneys in connection

4    with preparation for either deposition or trial?

5         A   No.

6         Q    So in getting prepared for the work that you

7    do as a witness for R.J. Reynolds, you've reviewed

o         ousiness records, internal company records, men wmn

9         attorneys and reviewed deposition testimony at times of

10    various witnesses, correct?

11         A   Are you asking me in general, in terms of my

12    general preparation for --

13         Q   Yes.

14         A   In general, my preparation has been that.  But

15    also my experience as a scientist.  I do talk to other

16    scientists and have throughout my career, so I certainly

17    rely on those discussions when I talk about issues with

18    regard to litigation.  So I don't specifically talk to

19    people at Reynolds to get ready for trial, but I

20    certainly rely on that experience � that business

21    experience and R&D experience at trial.

22         Q   And that has been true since 2008 when you

23    started getting involved in litigation, that you have

24    not specifically spoken with employees of R.J. Reynolds

25    in preparation for either deposition or trial?

Okay.  When did you first give a presentation? A science presentation?

Yeah.  Strike that.  Bad question.  Since --since starting work at Brown & Williamson in 1999, from that point forward, when was the first time you gave a 9   scientific presentation outside of the company? 10       A   Oh, outside of the company, I have not given a

12         Q   So if somebody �

13         A   I'm sorry.  I'm not � I'm not remembering my

14    own history.  I've given presentations to various health

15    groups over time.  I made a presentation � participated

16    in presentations with the -- to Greg Connolly,

17    Massachussets Department of Health.  I made

18    presentations to the Arizona Department of Health.  I've

19    been present at and participated in a presentation Brown

20    & Williamson made at CDC in Atlanta.  More recently I

21    have presented to the FDA in 2011, I think -- or early

22    2012.

23              So I apologize, I wasn't thinking.  I was

19    how can -- what types of designs and what kinds of

20    technologies could be utilized to reduce the harm

17
	A   Right around the 2000 time frame, in my       j

18
	opinion.

19
	Q   Okay.  So just so I understand your testimony, j

20
	it's your testimony that in the 2000 -- not earlier than \

21
	2000, we're talking about post 2000, correct?

	A    2000, that's right.

*�� -hS

1     that there was nroof sufficient to establish that

2    cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer? 4        A   When I -- when I contemplate what their

6    prior to 2004 was more verbose than, say, Brown &

7    Williamson's was, but when I read that as a scientist, I

8    concluded that Reynolds suggested that cigarette smoking

10              Yes, it's a longer statement than what Brown &

11    Williamson had, but it all really, to me, meant the same

12    thing even though I wasn't working there at the time.

13         Q   And what is your testimony in the post 2000

14    time frame that the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company

15    had taken with regards to whether or not cigarette

16    smoking had been sufficiently and scientifically proven

17    to be a cause of lung cancer and other fatal diseases?

18         A   I think Brown & Williamson's position was

19    after the year 2000 or 1999, was that cigarette smoking

20    is a cause of disease.  And I think that was � I think

22    they used.

23         Q   And in speaking -- and in speaking about ~-

24    strike that,

1    frame, the American Tobacco Company was no longer an

6         Alt was.

8    and R.J. Reynolds, what scientific study came out in the

10    Reynolds Tobacco Company to come out publicly and

11    definitively state that cigarette smoking had now been

12    scientifically established to be a cause of lung cancer

13    and other fatal diseases?

14              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

15         A   I don't know that any specific scientific

16    study drove that decision to � to continue to evolve

17    their position on cause and effect.  So I don't know

18    that there was a single study or a particular scientific

19    event that occurred that triggered that change in

20    position, but the position had basically changed and

21    evolved over -- over decades.  And this was really kind 1

1           Q   But if it wasn't a specific study or

2     scientific event in the year 2000 that, as you said,

3     prompted this change for either Brown & Williamson or

4     R.J. Reynolds to come to the conclusion that it had been

5     scientifically established that cigarette smoking was a

6     cause of lung cancer and other fatal diseases, what

7     other event in the year 2000 prompted Brown & Williamson

8     and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to make that change?

9           A   Again, I don't know that it was a specific

10     event, and obviously I was not -- I was not in a

11     position at that point in the companies that really --

12     that I participated in those discussions.  But certainly

13     there's a multitude of reasons why.

14                  Companies will � will change their public

15     positions on things or evolve their public positions on

16     particular issues.  So I couldn't say specifically what

17     individual event or series of events would have prompted

18     that.

19           Q   Okay.  And that's true -- that answer � your

20     answer is true despite all of the documents that you've

21     reviewed over the years and all of the preparation that

23     Reynolds Tobacco Company, correct?

1    the same in terms of not knowing what the event was in

2    the year 2000 that prompted both Brown & Williamson and

3    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to make that change that

5              Despite all the work that you've done in

6    preparation for depositions or trials and litigation

7    since 2008, you don't know what the event was in the

8    year 2000 that prompted both Brown & Williamson and the

9    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to make that change to

10    publicly state that there was scientific proof that

11    cigarette smoking was the cause of lung cancer and other

13              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

14         A   I have not seen sets of documents with regard

15    to this issue that would indicate any singular event

16    occurred that prompted a change in position of whether

17    it be R.J. Reynolds or Brown & Williamson.  I certainly

18    know that there had been discussions around the topic

19    for years.  I believe that -- and I just thought of the

20    man's name who was the head of Brown & Williamson in

21    '99, Nick Brookes.  I remember some information of what

22    might have been in a press release or something where he

23    talked about how our position was not well understood,

24    you know, prior to 2000, and how it was misrepresented  , w

1              So there may have been a whole bunch of

2    reasons and events that happened at the companies that

3    would prompt them to change that position.

4         Q   So it's your testimony that the public,

5    including public health agencies, simply misunderstood

6    Brown & Williamson's position on whether or not

8         A   I think -- I think in general, yeah.  I mean,

9    if you look at what the company's positions were over

10    time, I would say absolutely they were not -� they were

11    not well understood, and they're not well understood

13    easy scientific concepts to understand.

14              So, yeah, I think in general it was not well

15    understood what the -- why the companies had those

16    positions and what those positions might have been.

17         Q   And given what you know about R.J. Reynolds

18    and the work that you've done in preparation for

19    litigation, do you feel the same way, that R.J. Reynolds

20    was also misunderstood by the public, including the

21    public health agencies over all � you know, over the

22    past many decades?

23         A   I think in general, yes.

24         Q   And you don't think the public's

25    misunderstanding of either Brown & Williamson or R.J.

1    Reynolds had anything to do with the things that Brown &

4              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

5         A   They -- I -- quite possibly, yeah.  I think

6    there's -- there's -- try and understand what the

7    scientific position was of Reynolds going back in time,

8    is, again, not an easy concept and it's not easily

9    communicated, especially over whether its a newspaper

11    communicated.

12         Q    It's your testimony that it was not easy for

13    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to communicate it's

14    positions publicly regarding whether or not cigarettes

15    were scientifically proven to cause disease?

16         A   No,  I didn't say that.  I said it was not

17    easy to understand what they are from a scientific

18    perspective, because it is a complicated issue with --

19    which requires more explanation than a simple quick

20    tagline.

21         Q   Meaning it's difficult for folks to

22    understand?

23              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

13         Q   On how to answer questions when you're being

18    exposure-type cigarette, we anticipated media coverage

a  bonus  by  R.J.   Reynolds?

A Q

A

Well, yes.  I qualify for a bonus, yes. In 2011 your bonus

PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED

That's probably about right, yes.

What was it in 2012?

In   2 012    PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED

my annual salary, is what I would qualify for if the

that's what the annual bonus is for somebody at my

1    that, that it was dangerous and it caused disease.  So I

2    never really questioned that.

3         Q   You believed it, though, in 1984, right?

4         A   I did, yeah.  I mean, I had no reason to doubt

6       Q   Okay.  And when you joined Brown & Williamson

8    of lung cancer, correct?

9         A   I would say so, yeah.

10         Q   And in 1999, had Brown & Williamson publicly

11    stated that it was their corporate position that

12    cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer?

13         A   In '99, I don't know if they had made a public

14    pronouncement, per se, but certainly when I interviewed

15    there in '99 in April or March of that year, I was

16    struck that that -- that that seemed to be what their

17    position was, certainly the people I talked to.

18              MR. McPHARLIN:  Move to strike, nonresponsive.

19         Q   My question to you was, in 1999 when you began

20    work at Brown & Williamson, was the company's public --

21    corporate position that cigarette smoking was a cause

22    of -- was proven, scientifically and medically proven,

24    other fatal diseases?

1    '99 or 2000 when they had that position, it was right at

2    that time frame, so I don't know.  It may have been, it

3    may not have been.  But it was right in that -- right in

4    that time frame for Brown & Williamson.

5         Q    Do you know based on all the work that you've

6    done in preparing for and testifying in litigation, was

7    that Brown & Williamson's position in 1998 that there

8    had been scientifically and medically established proof

9    that cigarette smokinq was a cause of lunq cancer and

10    other fatal diseases?

11         A   In '98?  I don't know.  I think Brown and

12    Williamson's position would have been that cigarette

14    factor in the development of those diseases, so it

15    wouldn't have been as clearcut as a cause of disease.

16              MR. McPHARLIN:  Move to strike, nonresponsive.

17         Q   My question to you was:  In 1998, was it the

18    position of Brown & Williamson that cigarette smoking

19    had been scientifically and medically proven to be a

20    cause of lung cancer and other fatal diseases?

21              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

22         A   I'm sorry, I thought I'd answered your

24    corporate position at that point.

25         Q   Okay.  And do you know if that was their

en United Reporting, Inc.                                                                               o

1    corporate position, that cigarette smoking had been

2    proven to be a cause of lung cancer and other fatal

3    diseases in 1984?

4         A   I would say that would not have been their

5    position.

6         Q   Do you know if that was the position of the

7    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1984?

8         A   That would not have been their position.

9         Q   Do you know if that was the position of the

10    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company or the Brown & Williamson

11    Tobacco Company in 1994?

12         A   In 1994, no, that would not have been their

13    exact position, no.

14         Q    In any of the decades prior to 2000 given what

16         that you're thinking that both companies publicly stated

jl i          Ltiai cigarette smoKing caused �� was a cause or lung

18    cancer, but prior to ~~ any decade prior to 2000, was

19    that the position of either Brown & Williamson, the

20    American Tobacco Company or R.J. Reynolds, that

21    cigarette smoking had been proven to be the cause --

22    strike that.  Bad question.  Too long.

23              Prior to 2000, was it the position --

j         it wouio. nave oeen   j-qj.. jxeynoiois l umnK it was rignu

6    at 2000, so my answer would be, no, their position would

7    not have been the same as what you just stated prior to o         that.

9        Q   And when did R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

10    publicly admit that cigarette smoking was addictive?

11         A   Again, I believe the time frame would have

12    been around the year 2000.

13         Q   Prior to the year 2000, did the R.J. Reynolds

14    Tobacco Company publicly admit that cigarette smoking

15    was addictive?

16         A   Prior to that the company's position would

17    have been that which was consistent with the 1964

18    definition, so the answer to that is no.

19              MR. McPHARLIN:  Move to strike, nonresponsive.

20         Q   The question was, prior to 2000, was it R.J.

21    Reynolds' public position that cigarette smoking was

22    addictive?

23              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

24         Q    Yes or no?

25         A   The answer is no, that was not their position.

10    thinking of that specific case.

13    of these cases is the same.

14         Q    But my question is:  It would be difficult for

15    you to remember specific subjects that came up in a

16    specific case regardless of whether it was a year ago or

17    five years ago, am I correct?

20    questions like, Were the companies forthright and honest

21    in the Cohen case? The subject matter is always the

22    same.

23         Q   Okay.  So back to my original question:

13

18

20
	MR. LATHAM:  Objection, form.                :

21
	A   Again, no.  Cigarettes are designed to be     |

22
	smoked.  Obviously Reynolds knows that lots of people

23
	inhale but they were not designed for that necessarily.

24
	Q   And the distinction between being smoked and

25   being inhaled is drawing the smoke into your mouth as

2    being inhaled which is drawing the smoke further into

4         A   I would say so.  Inhalation is a two-step

	the cigarettes that they designed, manufactured and sold 1

	in the '60s, '70s, '80s and into the 2000s, when the

3
	smoke from those cigarettes are inhaled by the smoker,

4
	nicotine is rapidly delivered to the brain, correct?    f

	A   Are you asking me what current knowledge is at 1

	Reynolds?

7
	Q    I asked you what they know now.

8
	A   What we know now is, yes, that would be the

9
	case.  If cigarette smoke is inhaled that would be the  j

10
	fastest way in which nicotine would be transferred to    |

11
	the brain, correct.

12
	Q   And R.J. Reynolds recognizes that rapid       1

	Q   Okay.  You don't think that a product that    j

18
	enables rapid absorption of nicotine into the receptors  j

19
	of the brain puts that user at risk from becoming       >

1    which has nothing to do with inhalation and nothing to

2    do with rapid absorption to the brain, so my answer is

3    most definitively no.

4         Q   Okay.  So I just want to be clear, it's the

5    position of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company that a product

6    that allows for rapid absorption, chronic rapid

7    absorption of nicotine to the receptors of the brain

8    does not expose the user of that product to an increased

9    risk of addiction?

10              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

11         A   That's not what I said.

12         0   Okav  Well  is that true^  Is that what R J

13    Reynolds believes?

14         A   I think � I think R.J. Reynolds believes that

15    exposure to nicotine, which is the addictive substance

16    in tobacco products, can present addiction.  People can

17    get addicted to nicotine.  So chronic exposure to

18    nicotine, that's a possibility.

19         Q   All right.  Is it the -- is it your testimony

20    on behalf of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company that there

21    is -- that rapid absorption of nicotine by the receptors

22    in the brain, chronic rapid absorption is -- puts the

23    user at the same risk of addiction for somebody who just

24    absorbs nicotine through the lining of their mouth?

7         A   We certainly would recognize that smoking

9    Anything is inhalable, however.  Inhalation is a learned

19              MR, LATHAM:  Objection to form.

20         A   There is no feature to allow people to inhale,

21    it is a learned behavior.  To my understanding, Reynolds

22    has not addressed whether or not cigarette smoke can or

23    shouldn't be inhaled.

1         Q   Any diseases that have been linked to being

2    caused by smoking, did R.J. Reynolds intend their

3    cigarette products to cause those diseases?

4         A   R.J. Reynolds never intended to cause any

5    disease through the use of their products.  So my answer

6    would be certainly not -- no product was designed to do

7    that.

8         Q   When R.J. Reynolds designed, manufactured and

9    sold Winston, Winston Lights, Salem, Salem Lights, Kool,

10    Kool Lights and Doral Menthol Lights, did R.J. Reynolds

11    intend for the smoker to become addicted to the

12    nicotine?

13              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

14         A   No, they did not.

15         Q   With respect to those brands that I just

16    listed that R.J. Reynolds designed, manufactured and

17    sold, did R.J. Reynolds intend that the cigarettes would

18    deliver nicotine in sufficient quantities to sustain

19    addiction?

20              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

21         A   No, they did not.

22         Q   Okay.  R.J. Reynolds recognizes that, for

23    example, Doral Menthol Lights delivers nicotine in

24    sufficient quantities to sustain addiction, correct?

25         A   I would � I would say the answer to that is

1    yes and no.  Because no one knows what that line is,

2    what -- what amount of nicotine can be delivered that

3    would not sustain somebody who's addicted to nicotine.

4    I don't think that that has been scientifically

5    established.  So we � it's a yes and no answer.  I'm

6    sorry to not being any more specific than that.

7         Q   But you know � R.J. Reynolds knows that the

12         A   The amount that's in current � all current

13    cigarettes today are considered to be addictive, so I

14    guess the answer would have to be yes, that is known.

1         A   No.  That was never intended, no.

2         Q   Okay.  When R.J. Reynolds designed,

3    manufactured and sold Winston Lights, Salem Lights, Kool

4    Lights and Doral Menthol Lights, RJR intended for

5    smokers to smoke more deeply and take more puffs of

8         Q   When R.J. Reynolds designed, manufactured and

9    sold Winston, Winston Lights, Salem, Salem Lights, Kool,

10    Kool Lights, Doral Menthol Lights, R.J. Reynolds

11    expected that those cigarettes would expose smokers to

13    cause lung cancer and other fatal diseases?

14              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

15         A   No, that's not necessarily true, no.

16         Q   Is it indirectly true?

17         A   Certainly Reynolds knew by the time those

18    products were designed, because I believe those would be

19    in the 1970s, that carcinogens would be present in

20    cigarette products, but it would not be intended that

1    those cigarettes would expose the smoker to carcinogens

2    in sufficient quantities such that it could cause lung

3    cancer and other fatal diseases?

4         A   And my answer would be no.

5         Q   Okay.  And that would be true for the

6    cigarette -- those same cigarettes that we just listed

7    from the 1960s through the 2000s, that R.J. Reynolds did

8    not expect that those cigarettes � strike that.  Same

9    question I just asked you.

10              When R.J. Reynolds designed, manufactured and

11    sold Winston, Winston Lights, Salem, Salem Lights, Kool

13    Reynolds -- did R.J. Reynolds expect that the smoker

14    would become addicted to nicotine?

15         A   No.  Again, they would not have expected that,

16    depending on the time frame, but certainly not.

17         Q   Okay.  When R.J. Reynolds designed,

18    manufactured and sold Winston, Winston Lights, Salem,

19    Salem Lights, Kool, Kool Lights and Doral Menthol Lights

20    in the 1960s -- well, let me ask you that -- when did

21    Doral Menthol Lights first come on the market?

22         A   Doral Menthol Lights?  I think in the '70s.

10    Reynolds expect that the user of those cigarette

11    products could become addicted to it?

12         A   They would not have expected that, no.  And

13    mainly because they were not -- cigarettes were not

14    considered to be addictive in the 1970s.

16         of your answer as nonresponsive.

1    not the design intent.

2         Q   Okay.  R.J. Reynolds recognizes that smokers

3    of, quote/unquote, light cigarette products will take

4    deeper breaths of the smoke when they puff on the

6        A   I can't agree with that, because smoking

i          behavior is so variable

8         Q   You recognize that happens?

9         A   It can happen, yes.  Certainly.

10         Q   And it can happen because of -- of the way

11    that the light product is designed, correct?

12         A   No, that's not how.

13         Q    It has nothing to do with the design of the

14    product?

15         A   No, if I can explain I will.  When a person

16    who smokes a cigarette, if they smoke a heavier

17    cigarette and are used to that cigarette -- or are

18    acclimated to that product, if they try a light --

19    lighter cigarette, they are going to immediately notice

20    a difference, and then likely or possibly take a larger

21    puff to try to get what they were used to from a heavier

22    cigarette.  That does happen.  That's been recognized

23    for a long period of time.  The -- that type of behavior

24    is not necessarily sustained for a long period of time,

25    but it can happen during that transition period.

1         Q   R.J. Reynolds, then, recognizes that when a

2    individual smokes a, quote/unquote, light cigarette,

3    that they can, because of the differences in between a

4    regular cigarette and a light cigarette, take deeper

5    puffs on the cigarette?

6              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

7         A   I think �

8         Q   I think what you just testified to.

9         A   Yeah.  I think Reynolds has always recognized

10    that human smoking behavior is highly variable.  It is a

11    human behavior -- smoking itself regulating � is a

12    self-regulating behavior.  So people are going to change

13    their behavior based on the product that they're

14    presented with.  It does not mean that that's what the

16         Q   When R.J. Reynolds designed, manufactured and |

17    sold Winston, Winston Lights, Salem, Salem Lights, Kool,

18    Kool Lights and Doral Menthol Lights in the '60s and

19    '70s, given that the light products didn't come on the

20    market until the '70s, was it reasonable for R.J.

21    Reynolds not to expect that those cigarettes would

22    expose a smoker to carcinogens in sufficient quantities

23    to cause lung cancer years down the road?

1    position at that time, that it � that it was known that

2    that's what would happen.

3         Q   Right.  So you're --

4         A   But there was � certainly they recognized

5    there was an association between smoking and lung

6    cancer.  As -- with regard to your specific question on

7    the exposure to carcinogens, I think the answer has to

8    be no.

9         Q   It was not reasonable for R.J. Reynolds to

10    expect that users of those cigarette products would --

11    would be exposed to carcinogens in sufficient quantities

12    to develop lung cancer years down the road after chronic �

13    use?

14         A   I think Reynolds � I don't think � it's kind 1

15    of a convoluted question.

16         Q   I just want an answer to that question first.

17         A   Okay.

18         Q   Let me restate it again, hold on.  I just want j

19    to restate it again and then you can explain, but I

20    would actually just -- just for the purposes of the

21    record, I would like an answer to the question first.

22              MR. LATHAM:  Wait he can only answer a

23         question he understands and I think �

24              MR. McPHARLIN:  I know.

25              MR. LATHAM:  Okay.

3    sold Winston, Winston Lights, Salem, Salem Lights, Kool,

4    Kool Lights and Doral Menthol Lights in the 1960s and d            /Us, it was reasonable tor- R.u. Reynolds lobacco

6    Company to expect that the users of those cigarette

7    products would be exposed to carcinogens from those

8    cigarettes in sufficient quantities to cause lung

9    cancer?  It was reasonable that R.J. Reynolds would

10    expect that, right?

13         that R.J. Reynolds would have expected that, no.

14         Q   So it was reasonable --

16    have to explain because I don't believe that R.J.

17    Reynolds knew whether or not the exposure to carcinogens

18    that were in cigarette smoke would have been --

24    very complicated questions.

4              It was then, and based on your testimony, it

5    was reasonable for R.J. Reynolds not to expect that

7    and sold in the 1960s and '70s would deliver carcinogens

8    in sufficient quantities to the user such that chronic

11              THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Because they could not

12         necessarily make that link between what their

13         products were delivering to account for the

14         association between cigarette smoking and disease.

15         That's the reason.

16         Q   And then the indi- -- the consumers who

17    purchased and used Winston, Winston Lights, Salem, Salem

18    Lights, Kool, Kool Lights, Doral Menthol Lights in the

19    1960s and '70s, it would have also been reasonable for

20    them not to have expected that using those cigarette

21    products would expose them to carcinogens in sufficient

22    quantities such that chronic use of those products could

23    cause them to develop lung cancer and other fatal

24    diseases, correct?

1         A   I don't know whether it would have been

2    reasonable or not for them.  Certainly, I'm sure certain

4    that. j        \2         oo it was reasonaoie tor K,.ij * rveynoicts nor lo

7    the consuming public to expect it?

8              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

9         A   No, I didn't say that.  I said certain people 10         may have -- may have done that.  I think based on my

12    that most people didn't think that way.  Okay.  Most

13    people thought by the 1970s that cigarette smoking would

14    have been a cause of disease.  So that's all I'm saying.

15    I'm just � I'm not trying to reconstruct history.  I do

16    have an understanding of what had happened.

17         Q   So I just want to be clear, though:  You think

18    it's reasonable that R.J. Reynolds did not expect their

19    cigarette products to expose the users of those

20    cigarette products to carcinogens in sufficient

21    quantities such that it would cause � it could cause

22    lung cancer and other fatal diseases in the 1960s and

23     '70s, but it would not be reasonable for the consuming

24    public to have the same expectation?

12         A    If they knew about the delivery of carcinogens   f

13    in significant quantity, would it be reasonable for             f

14    them?  No, they could share Reynolds' opinion or they         |

15    could share Reynolds' position on that.  With regard to     f

16    carcinogens, I don't know that that was well known.              j

17    That's -- that's the reason I'm saying.  Is because             f

18    you're saying the products were designed was to deliver

19    carcinogens in sufficient quantity to account for lung

20    cancer, that's the part that I'm saying Reynolds                    j

21    didn't -- wouldn't have known, so it wouldn't have been z         unreasonable, ana so � but I don t nave any idea about

3                        A         Okay.

4         Q   So it's not your testimony that it would be

6    expectation as R.J. Reynolds did regarding whether or

7    not chronic use of those cigarette products that we've

8    listed in the 1960s and '70s would expose the user to

9    quantities of carcinogens sufficient to cause lung

10    cancer and other fatal diseases?

11              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

12              THE WITNESS:  Again, I think I answered the

13         question.  I don't -- I don't know �

14         Q   But you do know as to Reynolds, you just don't

15    know as to the public?

16         A   Right.  Because I don't know if the public was

17    exposed to that type of information.  Okay, it's not the

18    same type of information.  But, it � would it be

19    unreasonable, I don't think � if someone in the general

20    public had the same amount of information that Reynolds

21    had with regard to delivery of carcinogens and all the

22    health information, it's not unreasonable for the public

23    to have the same position that Reynolds had, no.  I just

24    don't know if that amount of information was really that

25    well known in the � in the � a lot of stuff was known I ^f

1    but it's just -- to that level, I'm not sure.

2         Q   You think the general public -- you don't

4    the delivery of carcinogens to the user of cigarettes in

5    the 1960s and '70s than R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

6    did, do you?

7         A   No, it was certainly known, but, I mean, I

8    would say in general Reynolds would have more

9    information or know more information than people in the

10    public.

11         Q   And what about -- what about like, let's say,

12    for example, a 16-year-old in 1965, do you think based

13    on your knowledge and expertise, that the R.J. Reynolds

14    Tobacco Company would have known more than that 15- or

15    16-year-old in 1965 regarding whether or not cigarettes

16    delivered quantities of carcinogens sufficient to cause

17    lung cancer and other fatal diseases?

18              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

19         A   Okay.  You kind of string a lot of things in

20    there.

21              Reynolds would not have � the answer is,

22    Reynolds would know -- would know more in general, but

23    Reynolds didn't know that their products would have

24    delivered enough carcinogens to cause lung disease in

25    1965.  But it's certainly reasonable to think that R.J.

1    expectation have a similar connotation to it.

2         Q   So you're saying that �

3         A   Do you understand what I mean?

4         Q   Well, you're saying in the '80s � in the

5    1980s R.J. Reynolds expected their cigarette products to

6    cause lung cancer and other fatal diseases?

7         A   They didn't expect it, but they recognized

8    that there was -- that that was a potential risk factor,

9    in the late '80s that's certainly where their position

10    was.  And as the 1990s progressed, the position was that

11    there was a major risk factor.  So there was � I guess

12    you would have to say that Reynolds would have

13    recognized that that expectation certainly existed and

14    that that was a possibility, certainly a strong

15    possibility moving forward.

16         Q   When R.J. Reynolds designed, manufactured and

17    sold Winston, Winston Lights, Salem, Salem Lights, Kool,

18    Kool Lights, and Doral Menthol Lights in the '60s and

19    the '70s, R.J. Reynolds -- it was reasonable for R.J.

20    Reynolds not to expect that those cigarettes would cause

21    a smoker to become addicted to nicotine?

22              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

23         A   Correct.

24         Q   And it was also reasonable for R.J. Reynolds

25    with regards to those cigarette products that I just

	listed in the 1960s and '70s not to expect that the use

2
	of those cigarette products could sustain somebody's    |

3
	addiction to nicotine?

4
	A   That is correct.

5
	Q   Okay.  And the same would be true for the     \

6
	consuming public in the 1960s and '70s, you would agree, \

7
	then, right, that it would not have been their

8
	expectation that the use of those cigarette products

9
	could have caused addiction to nicotine?

12
	considered addictive at that time.                      j

13
	Q   That's not my question.  You just testified

14
	that it was reasonable for R.J. Reynolds not to expect

15
	that those cigarette products in the 1960s that they    j

16
	designed, manufactured and sold would cause addiction,   j

1    Kool Lights and Doral Menthol Lights in the '70s, '80s

2    and into the '90s, it was reasonable for R.J. Reynolds

4    products could cause the smoker to become addicted?

5         A   Again, depending on the time frame.  I mean,

6    you understand that in '88 is when public health

7    authorities thought the product was addictive.

\j                                                   \ffi                        -L      1IL      \J 11 -lu y        L* O. -X J\ JL 11 vJ      CX hs \*s LJl K*      X\ # KJ   *       X\ vZ* V 11 v^ JL v_a O �        O JL JL   �

9        A   Well, but that's important because R.J.

10    Reynolds operates in -- in the world, at which

11    scientific, you know, information is discussed.  So I

12    can't just remove it from what it relies on and what it

13    gets influenced by.  So is it -- is it unreasonable?

14    R.J. Reynolds' position was that nicotine and cigarettes

15    was not addictive prior to 2000, so I think it's

16    reasonable for R.J. Reynolds to say that they did not

17    agree and that their products were not designed to

18    sustain addiction.

19         Q    So then it would -- when R.J. Reynolds

20    designed, manufactured and sold Winston, Winston Lights,

21    Salem, Salem Lights, Kool, Kool Lights, Doral Menthol

22    Lights in the '70s '80s and into the '90s, it was

23    reasonable for R.J. Reynolds not to expect that those

24    cigarette products could cause the user to become

25    addicted, correct?

5
	would be -- it would be reasonable to share Reynolds'

	position if they knew exactly the kinds of things that

1    would block the vent holes?

2         A   I mean, not all smokers block vent holes. o                     \2          inan wasn c my question.

4         A   I know that, but, I mean, you're asking me to

5    make large generalities about whether or not something

6    is reasonable or unreasonable and -- but the fact of the

7    matter is, is that some people block vent holes and some

8    people don't, so when would it be reasonable for

9    Reynolds to have an expectation that some people might

10    block vent holes?  Probably I would say in the late '70s

11    after some information was out there that some people

12    may or may not block the vent holes.  I don't know when

13    the first public literature was coming out, but

14    certainly some of this was being discussed in Surgeon

16              That would be my answer to your question.  Not

17    all answers can be quite easy and succinct, I'm afraid.

18         Q   After Reynolds learned that smokers could

19    block the vent holes of their light cigarette products,

20    did Reynolds then conduct any kind of advertising

22              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

23         A   Not that I'm aware of.  And it's not

24    necessarily a problem to block vent holes.  It's not

25    how -- it's not how the product was intended.  But, you

2    '60s, early '70s, correct?

3         A   Roughly.

4         Q   Was it reasonable for R.J. Reynolds not to

6    would take deeper puffs of those cigarettes based on the

7    way that people smoked light cigarettes?

8         A   Based on the design, no.  But certainly

9    Reynolds would have recognized that smoking behavior is

10    highly variable.

11         Q   So they knew it then when they manufactured -~

12    when they originally designed and manufactured those

13    light cigarettes that smokers would take deeper puffs?

14              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

15         A   No, they � they knew that certainly people

16    had variable smoking habits.  As a consequence of

17    design, no, they would not have expected that

18    necessarily.

5    nicotine, would carry with it the most risk.

6         Q   Is there any -- is there any method that

7    you're aware of today where people ingest nicotine

8    through a commercial product -- is there any product on

14    are commercially available today in which the -- the

16    on the market today that is more dangerous to the user

17    other than -- more dangerous than a cigarette to the

19         A   In the sense of which products carry the most

20    risk, no, absolutely cigarettes would carry the most

21    risk.  So that's -- that's how I would characterize it.

22         Q   And you would agree that a -- a cigarette is

23    dangerous -- smoking cigarettes is dangerous to the

24    health of the smoker?

1         A   Yeah, I mean, I don't -- I don't -- maybe I

2    can answer the question.  I don't know that Reynolds

3    knows that.  From my understanding of the scientific

4    literature, I don't know that Reynolds would know that

5    either.

6         Q   So let's just be clear because we were kind of

7    stepping over each other and that was partly my fault.

8    Does Reynolds -- R.J. Reynolds know whether or not speed

9    of a delivery of a drug to the brain increases the

10    likelihood that the user of the drug will become

11    addicted?

12         A   I don't believe Reynolds knows that, no.

13         Q   Does Reynolds know if quick absorption of a

14    drug increases the likelihood that the user of the drug

15    will become addicted?

16              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

17         A   I don't know that Reynolds knows that nor as a

18    scientist do I necessarily agree with that.

19         Q   You don't agree that absorption of a drug into

20    the bloodstream has any impact on whether or not it will

21    become -- the user will become addicted?

22         A   No, I didn't say that.  I � I thought you

23    said speed at which.  And absorption of a drug into the

24    blood supply, if that drug is addictive, then obviously

25    that mechanism by which the drug is absorbed could lead

2    it's absorbed, I'm not sure that that has a bearing on

3    how addictive it is.

4         Q   Reynolds doesn't know if the speed of

5    absorption has an impact on whether or not a -- or how

6    addictive a particular drug is?

7         A   That's correct.

8         Q   Okay.  But Reynolds recognizes that nicotine

9    through a cigarette when it's inhaled by the smoker is

10    absorbed into the bloodstream of the smoker?

11         A   It does, yes.

12         Q   And once that nicotine is inhaled and absorbed

14    then quickly delivered to the brain, correct?

15         A   It is -- in essence it is.  And the reason for

16    that is because when one inhales a drug or a cigarette,

17    the -- the absorption through the lung goes to arterial

18    blood, which then goes to the brain.  As opposed to

19    mouth absorption where the drug or nicotine, in this

20    case, would go through veinous blood and, therefore,

21    process through your metabolic pathways, through the

22    liver and whatnot before it would go to the brain.

23         Q    It is a much different delivery method for

24    nicotine to be delivered to the brain via the lunqs or

25    the lining of the mouth, correct?                                                   | ^

1         A   It is a different delivery method.  That is

2    absolutely correct; however, that doesn't mean that

3    smokeless tobacco is not addictive, which goes through

4    your mouth.

5         Q   Inhalation of cigarette smoke is the --

6    without inhalation of cigarette smoke you would not see

7    the -- the degree of lung cancer that you see with

8    cigarette smoking, correct?

10    base that opinion on the fact that cigar smoking is very

11    minorly related to lung cancers and most people do not iz*         engage in tne oenavior on innaiation witn cigar smoke,

13    although some people do.

14         Q    It's a � it's a � it's a very small

15    minority.

16         A   Right.  There are not a lot of people that I'm

17    aware of that do it, although I know that there are

18    people that do.  Same with pipe tobacco.

lj        \2         Kiyfit.  oo wiunoui. n.ne innaiation, n you hook

20    the inhalation out of the picture, you would not see the

21    epidemic form of lung cancer that you see with regards

23              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

24         A   I would say � you know, I don't know.  I

25    think certainly inhalation presents toxicants to the

1    lung, but I think the progression of disease has got to

2    do with the length of exposure by which people choose to

3    engage in that behavior.  So, yes, inhalation will

4    present a higher degree of risk of contracting disease,

5    but really it's -- it's a matter of the length of exposure by which one continues to expose their lungs to

7    that.

8              So if one -- I mean, that's pretty obvious, if

9    one quits smoking, your chances of lung cancer decrease

10    rapidly.

11         Q   If � if you designed a cigarette such that it

12    was highly unlikely that users of the cigarette would

13    inhale the smoke into their lungs, they -- there would

14    be -- you would not have that significant increased risk

15    for developing lung cancer, correct?

16              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

17         A   Again, I don't know that for sure because what

19    toxicants and carcinogens and one is going to expose

20    themselves whether they inhale the cigarette or not to

21    those toxicants.  To me it is a length of time by which

22    one exposes themselves to those toxicants and

4         Q   Well, just a moment ago you testified in your

5    opinion there is a very minor risk for developing lung

6    cancer through cigar smoking, correct?

7         A   Correct.

9         that it was very unlikely for the user to inhale the

10    cigarette smoke into their lungs, we would see the same

11    picture with cigarettes as we do with cigars, that it

12    would be a very minor risk for lung cancer, correct?

13              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form,

14         A   Potentially but those products already do

18         A   Okay.  Well, why would we redesign a product

19    to a product that already exists?

20         Q   But you agree that if � if the cigarettes

21    were designed similarly to the cigar such that it was

22    highly unlikely that the user would inhale the cigarette

23    smoke, you would see the same minor risk for the

24    development of lung cancer as you do with cigars,

	that, correct?

8
	><� A   Well, I just -- what I would agree with --    \

9
	what I would agree to is that if people didn't inhale

10
	cigarette smoke to the same amount that they inhaled    j

11
	cigarette smoke today that there would likely be a drop j

12
	in the lung cancer rates.  That I would agree to.  But I f

13
	would not agree to, if we designed a cigarette to be a

14
	cigar, it would no longer be a cigarette, it would be a j

15
	cigar.

16
	Q    If you designed the cigarette such that it was j

17
	just as unlikely to be inhaled as a cigar, you would see j

18
	the same very minor risk of developing lung cancer from \

19
	the users of that product, correct?                    \

20
	A   But the design has got nothing to do with

21
	inhalation.  That's my point.  If we wanted to make

22
	cigars we o. maKe cigars.  ine oesign or tne cigar is tne

23
	design of the cigar.                                  \

1    cigarette.  Both can be inhaled just as equally easily

2    as another.  It's -- you know, that is -- people inhale

3    cigar smoke, it's a learned behavior.  Anybody who's

4    ever started smoking, the first time they've tried to

6         Q   Reynolds could design their cigarettes � does

7    Reynolds -- does Reynolds manufacturer cigars?

8         A   We do not.

9         Q   Has they -- have they ever or any of the

10    companies that Reynolds has owned manufactured cigars?

11         A   I don't know, it's possible.  I haven't

12    thought about it.

13         Q   What about Brown & Williamson?

14         A   That's what I mean.  Whether Brown &

15    Williamson or American had made cigars.  They may have

16    at one time.

17         Q   You're not saying �

18         A   I can't rule it out.  I just � I just don't

19    know.

20         Q    You're not saying that Reynolds could not

21    manufacture a cigarette that is similar to that of a

22    cigar with respect to the unlikelihood of it being

23    inhaled by the user, you're not saying that Reynolds

24    couldn't do that?

1         A   I am saying that they couldn't do it because I

2    don't believe in that design.  I mean, you're offering

3    up a safer design hypothesis to me as I'm listening to

4    you, and I'm saying that that doesn't exist.  No one in

5    the public health community would suggest that a safer

6    design exists for cigarettes.

7              The suggestion that somebody should make a

8    cigarette taste like a cigar to end up being a safer

9    cigarette design has not -- has not been suggested in

10    my -- that I'm aware of, so I can't agree with your

11    hypothesis.

12         Q   So it's your testimony that Reynolds could not

13    develop a -- a cigarette that has the same qualities as

14    a cigar in which it would be unlikely for the user to

15    inhale it, that's what you're telling us?

16              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

17         A   No.  What I'm saying is that the design of a

18    cigar or the design of a cigarette doesn't have anything

19    to do with inhalation.  Inhalation is a learned

20    behavior.  If I want to learn how to inhale a cigar I

21    will, and people do.  People learn how to inhale

22    cigarette smoke, because it's not inhalable the first

23    time they smoke a cigarette.  If you've ever smoked a

24    cigarette you would know that, it's not an easy thing to I oi

�  00

2     difficult, no, I guess not.

3          Q   Okay.  And R.J. Reynolds has never gone out

4     and publicly stated that cigarettes were not designed to

5     be inhaled, correct?

6          A   To my knowledge, we have not, no.

7          Q   And R.J. Reynolds in the '60s, '70s, '80s and

8     into the '90s did not inform users of their cigarette

u          cause them to develop lung cancer and other fatal

11     diseases, correct?

12          A   Not that I'm aware of, no.

13          Q   Why didn't R.J. Reynolds inform their

16     that they would develop lung cancer from chronic use of

17     their products?

18          A   Because I don't know that Reynolds could

19     have -- would have known that, at a given point in time.

20          Q   Okay,  When did they know that?

21          A   I mean, I think it's generally believed today,

22     but certainly Reynolds' position would have been that

23     that wasn't established earlier � at earlier points in

24     time.                                                                                                                         I co

1         Q   I'm asking, it would have been reasonable for

2    them to do it?

3         A   It would have been � I don't know that it

4    would have been.  I don't believe it would have been

5    reasonable at a given point in time, certainly prior to

6    2000.  Because I don't know that Reynolds would have

7    held that position.  They would have agreed at various

8    points in time that smoking cigarettes and inhalation of

9    cigarette smoke would increase the risk of developing

10    disease.

11         Q   R.J. Reynolds never told their customers that

12    they would be better off from a health standpoint if

13    they simply smoked a cigar or a pipe, by puffing the

14    cigarette smoke into -- the smoke into their mouth as

15    opposed to inhaling it into their lungs?

16              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

17         A    Are you -- I'm sorry.  Are you asking me if

18    they had done that?

19         Q   R.J. -- I'll ask you again.  R.J. Reynolds

20    never informed their customers that they would be better

21    off from a health standpoint by smoking a cigar or a

22    pipe by puffing the smoke into their mouth rather than

23    inhaling it into their lungs?

1    or smooth the cigarette smoke is on the throat and lungs

2    of a smoker, correct?

3              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

4         A   To some degree.  Depending on, you know, what

5    you're talking about.  It's not necessarily the intent

6    of all additives, so I can't fully agree.

7         Q   They've known -- they've known that additives

8    and blending can affect the harshness and the smoothness

9    of the smoke on the smoker's lungs and throat since the

10    '60s, correct?

11              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

12         A   Again, there's a lot of additives for

13    different purposes, but some in some cases, yes.

14         Q   And since -- in the 1960s did they inform

15    smokers of their products that R.J. Reynolds cigarettes

16    were not designed to be inhaled by the smoker?

17              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

18         A   No.  We had never made that statement.  They

21    cigarette that tastes good to the smoker, correct?

2
	Q   You're saying R.J. Reynolds has never worked

3
	on designing and manufacturing a cigarette based on how I

4
	harsh the cigarette smoke is on the smoker?

5
	A   I did not say that, no.

6
	Q   So they've done that?

7
	A   No, they have not.  The difference that --    \

8
	well, the issue is, is you don't recognize what

9
	cigarette design is about.  And there is harshness that

10
	is expected with cigarette smoke, there is a harshness

11
	to cigarette smoke, but there are degrees.  And there is 1

12
	a balance that is struck when designing particular

13
	products.                                         |

14
	If there is no harshness to cigarette smoke   j

15
	it's not acceptable to consumers.  If it's too harsh    I

16
	it's not acceptable to consumers.  So there is a -     \

17
	someplace in the median where most cigarettes exist.  So

18
	tne aosence or narsnness is just as unacceptable as an  i

19
	overly harsh cigarette.                               \

20
	Q   Harshness affects inhalability, correct?      j

21
	A   No, not really.  It certainly is an indie- --  j

22
	is an indicator of inhalation.  When people feel the

23
	impact and harshness of cigarette smoke it gives them an j

24
	indication of how much -- for those who inhale, how much I

25   they will inhale.  So it is an indicator, but it does    \

1    not affect inhalation.  People control their inhalation.

2         Q   So it's your testimony as a representative of

3    R.J. Reynolds that the harshness of cigarette smoke does

4    not affect whether or not -- or how inhalable that

5    cigarette is?

6         A   Correct.  It's not -- again, with cigar smoke

7    being much more harsh than any cigarette smoke, that is

9         in my mind, is harsher than cigarette smoke.  So the

10    level of harshness of a product is an indication to the

11    smoker of how much smoke they have drawn into their

12    mouth and gives them an indication of how much they

13    would like to inhale based on what their behavior is, in

14    my opinion.

15         Q   And you recognize that smokers of cigars are

16    highly unlikely to inhale based on R.J. Reynolds'

17    experience in this industry, correct?

18              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

19         A   Again, it has nothing to do with --

	Q   Smooth menthol.  Is smooth menthol designed to f

3
	be smooth to the inside of the smoker's mouth or is it   |

4
	designed to be smooth to the smokers throat and lungs?   f

5
	A   I think the term smooth is supposed to be in   |

6
	reference to how the smoke would feel.  And menthol is

7
	an additive that's used that certainly provides a

8
	cooling effect in the smoke.

9
	Q   Right,  So my question was, is it designed to

10
	have that cooling effect on the inside of the smoker's  i

11
	mouth or is it designed to have that cooling effect on

12
	the smoker's throat and lungs?                       \

	MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.               =

14
	A   I mean, I think it's -- I think it has that   [

15
	effect throughout.                                  \

16
	Q   How is it designed?                        j

17
	A   It was designed to be cooling.               1

18
	Q   To what?                                  |

22
	soon as a smoker smokes it � we design our products in j

23
	recognition of how our consumers use them.  So we       |

	recognize that consumers inhale.  We also recognize that \

1    our consumers use them.  Those who inhale and those who

2    do not.  So it does both.

3         Q    So Reynolds designed menthol cigarettes based

4    on their understandmcr that their customers were

5    inhaling their cigarette products?

6         A   Certainly we knew that, yes.

7         Q   And that was the reason why you designed

8    menthol cigarettes, so that that inhalation of the

10    smoker?

11         A   No.  We wanted to make a cooling sensation for

12    the smoker.  That's why those products are designed that

13    way, and that's what it delivers,

14         Q   It wasn't designed -- menthol cigarettes were

15    not designed, you're telling us, so that they would be

16    cool -- cooling -- have a cooling effect on the smoker's �

17    lungs and throat?

18         A   No, I think -- I think it � it was

19    designed -- it was � menthol was used to do that, to

20    provide a cooling sensation to the smoker, both for the

21    mouth and for the throat and potentially for the lungs. c.z,         i oon t Know tnat it necessarily coois lug lungs,

23    because menthol actually is a bit sharp, in my opinion.

24    But certainly you get a cooling sensation in your mouth

25    when you smoke a menthol cigarette.

1         Q   And Reynolds understands that by making the

2    smoke smooth or cool to the smoker, they are increasing

3    the likelihood that somebody would inhale the cigarette

4    smoke?

5         A   Again, I don't believe that that is the case.

6    Okay.  Inhalation is a learned behavior.  Menthol

7    products for me, as when I was a nonmenthol smoker, I

8    found menthol products to be completely unacceptable.  I

9    felt they actually burned as opposed to cooled, so not

10    everybody is going to have that � that feeling.

11         Q    Did R.J. Reynolds run any ads instructing

12    their customers not to inhale their cigarettes?

1         A    I -- I don't -- I don't know whether or not

2    that is true.  Certainly the Surgeon General and others

3    would have made that suggestion.  But in all likelihood,

9    nonfiltered cigarettes?

10              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

11         A   Again, I'm not an expert on what consumer

12    awarenesses are.  So I don't know that.  I know about

13    science and I know about the epidemiology.  And

14    certainly the epidemiology would suggest that filters

15    compared to nonfilters is definitely reduced risk �

16    relative risk is lower.

1   would -- I would say I don't know what -- what the

3    can imagine, because what public health community was

4    saying about filters versus nonfilters, that people

5    would believe that filters are potentially safer than

6    nonfilters.  Certainly the Surgeon General said that for

7    decades, so it would not be surprising to me that the

8    public would think that filters would be better.

9              MR, McPHARLIN:  Move to strike, nonresponsive,

10         Q   I didn't ask you anything about what anybody

9

10

11
	filtered cigarettes were safer than nonfiltered         I

17

	MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

20
	A   The reason I think it's possible � well,     |

21
	because I can't -- I can't argue for what every single  j

22
	consumer would know, but I think in general based on    j

23
	what I know about public awareness and what the public  j

25   versus nonfiltered cigarettes, then I would say it's    j

8    would say that we have not finished with that

9    deposition, so it's an incomplete deposition.

10         Q   Okay.  Sure.  At Page 231 you were asked this

11    question:  Reynolds believed when it first marketed

12    light cigarettes that they were safer cigarettes,

13    correct? Answer:  Reynolds would have believed that a

14    light cigarette, if a risk existed, would be lower, they

15    would have believed that.

16              So that was a question that you were asked and

17    that was your answer, correct?

18         A   Uh-huh.

19         Q   Yes?

20         A   I agree with that, yeah.

21         Q   All right.  So when Reynolds first marketed

22    light cigarettes they believed they were safer, correct?

23              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

24         A   Right.  But I -- my answer was in context to

1    position was at the time, so I would certainly stand by

2    my answer.

1         A   Not completely.  You're not completely

2    correct.  They were designed to lower tar and

3    nicotine -- which has -- public health community

4    recommendations would suggest, but also consumer demand

5    was there.  The consumers demanded lower tar and

7         Q   Part of the � part of the reason for the

10    correct.

11         Q   And how many -- how many people have died from

12    smoking cigarettes since the 1960s, filtered cigarettes?

13         A    I don't know.

14         Q   Okay.  The vast majority of cigarettes on the

15    market from � probably starting somewhere in the 1960s

16    and on were filtered cigarette products, correct?

17         A   Correct, yes.

18         Q   The vast majority of the smoking-related

19    illnesses and deaths past the '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s

20    until today are connected to people who use filtered

21    cigarette products, correct?

22              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

23         A   I think it's � I think it's reasonable to

24    suggest that certainly since the '70s the vast majority

1    certainly has not eliminated the risk associated with

2    smoking through the use of filters or lower tar

3    products.

4         Q   And the numbers in the � let's say, for

5    example, in the 1990s, the people who died from

6    smoking-related illnesses, the vast majority of those

7    people would have acquired those illnesses through a

8    filtered cigarette product, correct?

9         A   Again, that --

10         Q    If they were -- if they were, in fact, smoking

11    related.

12         A   Not necessarily.  I mean, people who have died

13    in the '90s might have been born in the '30s, they

14    probably would have used the nonfiltered cigarettes.  So

15    I can't fully agree with that.  I would say certainly

16    that filtered cigarettes and lower tar cigarettes have

17    not eliminated the risk associated with smoking, so

18    people have died and will die through the chronic use of

19    filtered cigarettes potentially.

20         Q   As you � as you've testified, the vast

21    majority of cigarettes that have been on the market and

22    used have been filtered since the '60s, you recog- --

6    agencies in the '70s, the '80s, the '90s, the 2000s, up

9         A   There -- there are those studies, yes.

10         Q   And if we were to consider the number of

16         A   � or an annual basis?

17         Q   Yes.

18         A   I think the -- well, the CDC would suggest

19    there's over 400,000 people that die from

20    smoking-related diseases on an annual basis, but -- and zi         LnG r UA may disagree.  xnere s an ru/\ report l. nat says

2    vast majority of them probably smoked -- most likely

3    smoked filtered cigarette products?

4              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

5         A   Again, I have no way of knowing how that would

6    be calculated.  I would certainly concede that many of

7    them probably did, but I don't know how that would be

8    known.

9         Q   What's the -- what's the percentage of

10    filtered cigarettes on the market as opposed to

11    nonfiltered cigarettes on the market from -- in the

12    1980s?

13         A   In the 1980s I would say that most people were

14    smoking filtered cigarettes by then.

15         Q   Pretty much like 95 percent?

16         A   I don't know what the numbers are but very

17    high, yeah.

18         Q   Almost exclusively, correct?

19              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

20         Q   If you're talking about the percentage of

21    people who smoke, it is a very minor percentage of those

22    in the 1980s who did not smoke a filtered cigarette.

23              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

24         A   Probably so.  But --

4         Q   R.J. Reynolds is still not sure today if light

7         A   They're not prohibited, we have not sought to

2              Answer:  I wouldn't say that we are

4    been trying to do is make very low tar yielding

5    products.  Part of that, when you lower the tar

6    associated in combustible products, you will also lower

7    the nicotine.  I mean, by the same token there have been

8    a lot of efforts to try and change the target nicotine

9    ratio as well, which we've attempted to do, but from a

10    commercial aspect have not been successful.

11              So when you were asked, why are you trying so

12    hard � well, you were asked that question, you gave

13    that answer, correct?

14         A   Perhaps.  I mean �

	the answer I gave there, it was in reference to the     [

4
	question before that which said:  You said that nicotine j

5
	does not cause disease, do you remember that?  And my   \

6
	answer was:  That is correct, nicotine has not been     \

7
	causally linked to particular diseases so far as I know. \

8
	So then the question was:  So if that's the   \

9
	case then why were you guys trying so hard to make      j

10
	products with very low nicotine yields?  And I was      |

11
	suggesting that ultimately we were trying to lower tar   \

12
	and when you lower tar you lower nicotine.  They both go \

13
	together.  Because the tar portion of the smoke is where j

1
	We aren't necessarily trying to, correct?              \

2
	A        Correct.  Because what we're trying to do is

3
	address the potential association between smoking and   j

4
	disease, nicotine doesn't cause disease.  Okay.  It's   j

5
	the toxicants in smoke that do.  And when you lower tar,

6
	you lower toxicants.  And potentially if you lower      [

7
	toxicants, you might reduce disease.  So that's why we  f

8
	do that.  But the consequence is you're also lowering    \

10    what you mean.

11         Q    Is it R.J. Reynolds' position that it is the

12    taste of the cigarette that compels chronic repetitive

13    use as opposed to the nicotine in the cigarette?

14         A    I, my -- I think taste can certainly have

15    something to do with that, yes.  Certainly nicotine can

16    have something to do with that.  I think it's a

17    complicated scenario.

19    has more to do with chronic repetitive use than

20    nicotine?

22         Q   One of the tests �

1        A   I think in general it is.  And, again, it's --

2    the test is on the person, of course, not on the

3    products.

4        Q    The product is the � is the addictive

5    product, though, correct?

6             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

7        A   Well, again, it's -- the test is run on the

8    person and that is how it's determined.  You can't make

9    that determination on the product.

10        Q   But you don't need to run --

11        A   You can't run -- you can't run Fagerstrom on a

1 ^            CXUui BLLc �

13        Q   Right.  But you don't have to run Fagerstrom

14    on a cigarette to know that a cigarette can be

16        A   I don't.  I believe that it's feasible.

17        Q   And you still get cravings for cigarettes,

18    don't you?

19             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  Beyond the

20         scope.

21        A   I don't know, from time to time, perhaps.

22    Yeah, I miss smoking from time to time.

1              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

2         A   I don't know, I'm not an expert in that area.

4    anything that one ingests in the body I think

5    potentially affects the brain and does.

6         Q   Getting back to the Cohen deposition, were you

7    asked this question and did you give this answer:  Do

8    you agree that when you smoke, the nicotine actually

9    changes the brain, that's why quitting is so hard?

10              Answer:  You know, I'm not that -- I'm not

11    that familiar with the kind of scientific information.

12    I do understand that nicotine can, does go to the brain

13    and there are receptors, nicotinic receptors that

14    changes the brain, you know, I don't know.  From a

15    chemistry standpoint, sure, I would say yes.  But,

16    again, eating food changes the brain as well, so, you

17    know, I'm not really sure that I know what that means

18    necessarily.

iy                              but in looKing at your answer, you saiQ

20    were you asked that question and did you give that

21    answer?

22         A   Yeah, I think that sounds like the answer I

23    gave and it sounds similar to the answer I just gave

24    you, I think.  So I would stand by that answer.

25         Q   Right.  You said from a chemistry standpoint,

1         sure, I would say yes.

3              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

4         Q   I Qidn t say that s all you said.  But that is

5    part of your answer, correct?

6              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

7         A   It is part of my answer, correct.

8         Q   Right.  Part of the answer to the question:

9    Do you agree that when you smoke, the nicotine actually

10    changes the brain, that's why quitting is so hard?  Part

11    or your answer was, rroin a cnemisury standpoint., sure, i

12    would say yes.

13              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

15              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

16         A   Again, I can -- I would rest by my whole

17    answer on that.

18         Q    Okay.  But my question is from a chemis----

19    from a chemistry standpoint, you would agree with that

20    statement that nicotine changes the brain, that's why

21    quitting is so hard?

23         A   I don't know that that's necessarily the case.

24    I know that nicotine when it goes into the brain can --

25    there are changes that occur, so I agree with that.  But

ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm                                                                                       g

1    I don't know that's why quitting is so hard.

2         Q   Okay.  Well, that --

3         A    Okay,  So I can't -- I'm sorry, but I've got

4    to separate the two.  So when I say from a chemistry

5    perspective, yes, it changes the brain, that's the part

6    I know.  Whether or not that's connected to making it

7    harder to quit, that I don't know.

8         Q   But you didn't -- you didn't separate the two

9    in your answer that you gave, correct?

10              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

11         A   Well, I'm sorry, but I kind of did because I

12    explained my answer.

13         Q   Where did you say in your answer that I'm ~~

14    from a chemistry standpoint, sure, I would say, yes, but

15    I don't mean that as to whether -- as to why that's

16    so -- makes it so hard to quit?

17         A   Bingo, right there.

18         Q   No, you didn't say that.  I'm asking you,

19    where in your answer do you say that?

20              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

21         A   Well, if you read the rest of my answer again

22    I think it explains it.  So, I mean, if you read the

23    whole answer, I think it puts it into context.  I would

24    say that I don't know that those are all the -- that I

25    don't have that information.  So if you read � I mean,

1    I can't -- I don't have a photographic memory, but if

2    you just read the answer, I think it speaks for itself. J        Q   So from what you re saying � at least from

4    what you're saying, at least today, you're saying that

5    you agree that chronic use of nicotine changes the

6    brain?

7              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

8         A   From that aspect I would say sure, yes, that

9    is -- that is possible.

10         Q   And when Reynolds designed their cigarettes

11    including the list of cigarettes that we had gone

12    through already in this deposition back in the 1960s and

14    intention that chronic use of those cigarettes would

15    cause changes in a smoker's brain?

16         A   No.

17         Q   is pure nicotine cytotoxic?

18         A   I mean, anything is cytotoxic depending on

20    would say probably, yes, at certain concentrations it

21    could be.

15    I don't know that we've tested pure nicotine or not in

17              That was partially -- my whole answer again

18    is, pure nicotine question.  I don't know that we have

19    a -- I don't know that we have a position on that.  I'm

20    trying to think if it is -- if it -- if it is cytotoxic.

7
	A   I don't -- again, I don't know that we have or \

8
	have not looked.  Okay.  I don't know as I'm sitting    j

9
	here.  All I know is what I know about cytotoxicity     f

10
	testing, is that most things can be cytotoxic given the

11
	concentration.  So nicotine might very well be cytotoxic \

12
	depending on the concentration, which is the first      |

13
	answer I think I gave you when you asked me that        \

14
	question.                                            \

15
	Q   What is cytotoxicity?

16
	A   It's basically cell death.

17
	Q   What is genotoxicity?

1 0
	A   It causes gene disruption, gene mutations.    j

19
	Q   So a substance that can cause either          j

20
	cytotoxicity or genotoxicity, cell death or gene death,  |

21
	could be dangerous to the user, correct?              \

22
	A   Again, possibly.  But it's all based on a

23
	relative oasis oecause just sdoul anytning can oe

24
	cytotoxic and genotoxic, but, yes, that's a possibility, j

25   That's what the tests are meant to do --              |

	Q    I'm sorry to interrupt you.  What has Reynolds |

	done to determine the cytotoxicity or the genotoxicity  j

5
	of nicotine in their cigarette products?

6
	A   In their cigarette products, it's neither     \

7
	genotoxic or cytotoxic as far as I know because the     \

8
	concentration is quite low.                           \

14
	nicotine in their cigarette products is either cytotoxic j

15
	or genotoxic?                                        \

16
	A   That would be not really easy to determine in  j

17
	cigarette products.  What I can say with regard to      |

18
	nicotine on those measures is that nicotine is neither  j

19
	considered -- is not considered to be a health hazard by |

2         A   I don't know that we've � we've not done

3    anything because it's not been necessary to do, it's not |

4    a health concern, so we wouldn't have done that with

5    regard to nicotine.

6         Q   And what has -- well, you -- what has Reynolds

7    done to determine if nicotine is cytotoxic or genotoxic?

8         A   Nothing that I'm aware of, because it's not a

9    health issue.

10         Q   Okay.  Well, you've already testified that you

11    don't know if nicotine is or isn't cytotoxic, correct?

12         A   Correct.

13         Q   And you are -- you don't know if nicotine is

14    or isn't genotoxic, correct?

15         A   Correct.

16         Q   And Reynolds doesn't know it either, correct?

17              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

18         Q   Okay.  I'll rephrase the question.  Reynolds

20    cytotoxic, correct?

21              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

21        A   They have. And I believe to Minnesota and

22    Texas as well.

5    to read it and go through it.

6        Q   Sure.  Sure.  Just give me a second, though.

7    Well, regardless of the method that they came up with

8    their results, you understand that the results they came

9    up with showed an increase in nicotine yield from 1998

10    to 2004, correct?

14    increase of about .0 � either 002 milligrams or

15    02 milligrams, which I would argue is not statistically

16    significant at all.

17             So I'm aware of their conclusion, but I �

18    I � the basis by which they render that conclusion is j_y         actually a dit silly.

20        Q   So the Massachussets Department of Health is

21    silly?

22             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

23        A   That statement is in my opinion, yes.  Because

24    manufacturing variability and year-to-year crop

23    nicotine yields above 10 percent for the seven-year

25    the largest percent increase, 36 percent in nicotine

4        A   That's what they said.  I can � I can

5    certainly tell you that manufacturing variability on

6    nicotine is about 20 percent.  So we're no better from a

7    manufacturing standpoint on nicotine yields than about

8    20 percent.  So, again, with crop-to-crop year

9    variability added into that, 36 percent is not a very

10    large change so �

11        Q   You're saying that �

12        A   � what I'm saying is, there is no major

13    increase with nicotine for that particular brand.

14        Q   You're saying that an inc- � a nicotine yield

19    particular number, nicotine, as measured in smoke, then

21    I can tell you from crop-to-crop year, you will have a

22    fairly large change depending on the weather conditions

23    that also needs to get added into that.  So that's part

17    was looking at the � I thought I was looking at a

18    reprint of the published article.  This doesn't look

22    like a -- it doesn't look like that.

7        Q   This is a study conducted by the Massachussets

8    Department of Health?

9        A   That was not my question.  This is not a

10    peer-reviewed study that it will be reviewed by other

11    scientists for validity purposes, right, in concordance

12    with scientific principle?

8    38 percent increase in the Doral cigarette of nicotine

9    yield between '98 and 2004, and you hand me an article

10    that's purported to have this data in here, and it

11    doesn't have any data in it and it's not a peer-reviewed

12    article.  And I don't see any data or any numbers that

13    would suggest that Doral went up by that percentage.

14              So I'm not quite sure where you're getting

15    that number and where in this article it talks about the

16    actual data.

17         Q   Okay.  Hang on one second.

20         Q   Let me ask you something, Dr. Figlar.  Are you

21    aware of a study conducted by   the Massachussets

22    Department of Health in which   they analyzed the nicotine

23    yield of cigarettes including   several brands by R.J.

24    Reynolds?                                                                                                      1 oi

1    Greg Connolly, which was working for the Massachussets

2    Department of Health, and they analyzed the data that we

5    they purported an increase of nicotine over a period of

6    time which we then went and talked to them and basically

7    explained that there was no intentional increase,

8    because it was so small and not statistically

9    significant, in my opinion.

10             Now, this article that I've got in front of me

11    here that you've handed me to me is neither a � it is

12    neither a peer-reviewed scientific article and it

13    doesn't contain any data.  And I think you would agree

14    with that because it doesn't.

15        Q   Okay.  I'm asking you if you're familiar with

16    the study that they did.

17             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

18        A   I'm under ~ I'm familiar with that study that

19    I just talked about.

20        Q   Okay.  So you're not familiar with the

21    Massachussets Department of Health study regarding the

22    change of nicotine yields from 1998 to 2004?

P

1    would say I don't know what they studied because there's

2    no data in there.

3        Q   Okay.  Are you aware, yes or no, if the

4    Massachussets Department of Health ran a study where

6    brands?

7        A   Well, I'm � no, I'm aware of the Connolly

8    one.  If that was it, then I would say that they didn't

9    run any data because they didn't have any data.  Or

10    there's no data on that, at least.

11        Q   So then you don't know if they � if they

12    found an increase in nicotine yields in the Doral

13    Menthol Light brand, for example?

14        A   I don't know if they did or did not.

15        Q   Okay.

16        A   And I haven't seen any data to make that

17    evaluation.  I can certainly testify that nicotine

18    yields vary on an annual basis, on a year-to-year basis

19    based on crop years.

20        Q   Right.

21        A   And there's a -- and, of course, manufacturing

22    variability, so it's not surprising that it moves

23    around.

24        Q   Right.  And then you � you know that the �

25    hold on a second, I need to find it.

5    say that there was an increase on a year-to-year basis,

6    but if you -- if you actually recite what the number is,

7    you'll find that it's certainly below both manufacturing

8    variability as well as year-to-year crop variability.

9        Q   Right.  But whether you think the � the

10    year-to-year increase is significant or not, they found

11    an increase in nicotine yields from year to year between

12    1997 and 2005, correct?

13             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

14        A   Well, what � again, what is that number?

15    What are they �

16        Q   I'm not asking you what the number is,

17    Dr. Figlar.  I'm asking you if that study determined

18    that there was an increase in nicotine yield for each of

19    the years from 1997 to 2005.

1    increase, yes.  And, again, I will reiterate that you

2    can � of course, you can find an increase if one looks

3    for it, but if you don't actually recognize the sources

4    of variability then the increase is meaningless.  I

5    mean, that's scientific knowledge.  I can't help it that

6    they didn't account for manufacturing variability in

7    their study, but they should have.

8        Q   So they didn't do a good job in their study?

9        A   Correct.  That would be my � that would be my

10    argument, yes.

11        Q   Right.  And if they had found a decrease in

12    nicotine yield, would you have been of the same opinion?

13        A   Based on the -- based on the degree of which

14    the increase was found with the same kind of number, it

15    wouldn't surprise me.  I mean, if you would like to read

16    what the percentage was I'm pretty sure it was like .002 /         or ,uz milligram increase per year, wnicn is a Lotaiiy

18    nonsignificant amount.  It's not even really measurable

19    on a tobacco percentage basis.

20             I can't help it that sometimes scientists

21    stretch in terms of what they think they see.

1    manufacturing variability is, it's 20 percent.  So if

2    you're not larger than the manufacturing increase, then I

17         A   I don't think it would be.

18         Q   Well, you said in general, so that implies

19    there are some situations where you don't have to be

20    clear.

21         A   I think there is some cases where you are not

22    intentionally � where you might unintentionally be

23    unclear.  Does that make sense?

24             I mean, if you look back in time and you say,

5        Q   All right.  Let me -- I'll rephrase it.  He --

16    were hazardous, correct?

5        Q   Perhaps a better working arrangement, an

7    purpose were rephrased in a manner that would not assume

8    the existence of a hazard that has not been

9    scientifically established.  That's what he said, right?

10        A   That � that is what he said, yes.

11        Q   He is saying in no uncertain terms that there

12    is no proof that cigarette smoking poses a hazard to the

13    cigarette smoker, correct?

14        A   He's suggesting that there's certainly � that

15    that has not been established, but, you know, of course,

16    the Tobacco Working Group went on to try to make a safer

17    cigarette and that's what they called the project and he

18    participated in it.

2    statistics were there and real, but they didn't know

4        Q   Where does he say that here, that they're �

5    that we recognize the statistics?

6        A   He didn't here.  But, I mean, Bowman Gray did

7    four years earlier in congressional testimony, so that

8    was known then.

10        A   I'm sorry?

11        Q   You don't know that that was nonresponsive?

12        A   No, I didn't.  I'm sorry, I thought I was

13    adding contextual pieces to my answer.

14        Q   Okay.  And where does he recognize that there

15    is any risk at all? In fact, he says the opposite,

17             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

18        A   Where does he say there's no risk?

19        Q   Where does he say there's risk?

20        A   All right.  But don't say that he said the

21    opposite because I don't see that in here.  He says at

22    the very end, I assure there's an intense interest in

23    helping with what you have aptly described as a complex

24    problem.

4        Q   That was a national ad campaign developed and

5    disseminated by R.J. Reynolds?

6        A   I believe that is correct, yes.

7        Q   Okay.  And if you look at Page 3, first

8    column, Mr. Long states at the bottom of that column:

9    The fact is that questions that had been raised about

10    the use of tobacco products remain unanswered.  For

4    undertaken campaigns to make those products � those who |

6    outcasts.  That's what he said, correct?

8        Q   If you can continue down.  Through our new

11    issues and respond to the charges that have been leveled

13             So not only is he going to defend the company,

3             So he saw that it was necessary for R.J,

4    Reynolds to be the leader that they were in the industry

5    to step forward and tell the public what they really

6    believed about cigarettes and smoking and health,

7    correct?

8        A   That's what he believed.

9        Q   Right.  If you go to the next page.  That's a

10    print of the � one of the versions of the ad campaign,

11    Open Debate, correct?

12        A   It looks to be, yes.  I don't know if this is

13    one of the ones that ran or not, but it looks to be one,

14    yes.

15        Q   If you go to the � about the � quarter of a

16    way down, studies which conclude that smoking causes

17    disease have regularly ignored significant scientific

18    evidence to the contrary.  These scientific findings

19    come from research completely independent of the tobacco

20    industry.  That's what R.J. Reynolds said, right?

21        A   Yes, that's what's written here, yes.

22        Q   We at R.J. Reynolds think you will find such

23    evidence very interesting because we think reasonable

24    people who analyze it may come to see this as not a

25    closed case but as an open controversy.

1    debate campaign that we were just reviewing together,

2    right?

3        A   It would be, yes.

4             MR. McPHARLIN: Now, let's go ahead and mark

5        this as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 5.

11        Q   is this a reprint of the open debate campaign

12    that we were � had been talking about?

13        A   It looks to be, yes.

14        Q   Do you see at the top a reference to New York

16        A   I do, yes.

17        Q   Do you have any -- any reason to doubt whether

18    or not this was actually run in the New York Times?

19        A   I don't.

23    with regard to the open debate campaign.

13    something that is � that the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

14    Company actually believes about their product?

15             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

16        A   I think whatever was written and published in

17    the New York Times with regard to their position on

18    smoking and health, what was � what was published, the

19    public certainly had the right to say that is what

20    Reynolds believed because that would have been true.

21        Q   And when Edward Horrigan goes on Nightline and

22    talks about the company's position about whether or not

23    there's any proof that cigarette smoking is the cause of

24    any disease, the public has the right to rely on that

25    information as well from R.J. Reynolds?

1                    A        Based  on what  Horrigan  said,   yes,   that's

2    correct.

3        Q   And did he take the position on Nightline that

4    there was proof sufficient to conclude that smoking was

5    the cause of any disease?

2        A   I don't � I don't have any reason to doubt

3    it, no.

4        Q   And the Tobacco Institute, as we established

5    earlier, is the entity that was formed by the companies

6    including R.J. Reynolds for the purpose of speaking on

7    behalf of the companies about issues like this, correct?

8        A   They did have that authority, yes.

9        Q   Right.  So when Bill Dwyer is issuing this

10    press release he's doing that not only on behalf of the

11    Tobacco Institute but on behalf of R.J. Reynolds,

12    correct?

13        A   He was.  That's my understanding of the

14    relationship is that Reynolds would have approved of

15    what Mr. Dwyer would have said.

16        Q   Okay.  And this is dated January 10, 1979?

17        A   Correct.

18        Q   Do you know what the significance of

19    January 10, 1979, is?

20        A   I don't, but I think this is just before the

21    '79 Surgeon General's Report would have come out.

22        Q   Okay.

23        A   I believe.

24        Q   January 11th? When did the Report come out?

25        A   I don't know, but it came out soon after, I

1         think.

2        Q   Right.  The release of the new Surgeon

3    General's Report on smoking on the 15th anniversary of

4    the first one suggests it would be more rehash than

5    research.  Science doesn't time its findings; that's

6    what he said, right?

7        A   That is what that says, correct.

8        Q   So he's referring to the Surgeon General's

9    Report as more rehash than research, right?

10        A   He did say that, yes.

11        Q   Okay.  And that's what he said on behalf of

12    R.J. Reynolds, right?

14        Q   Do you know if Bill Dwyer or the Tobacco

15    Institute was ever reprimanded for making statements    K

16    like this by R.J. Reynolds?

17        A   I don't know if they were or not.

18        Q   Have you ever seen anything to suggest that

19    they were?

20        A   I have not, no.  But that � I'm not saying it

21    doesn't exist, but I have not seen it.

22        Q    In none of the thousands of documents that

23    you've reviewed have you seen anything like that?

24        A   Not that I recall, no.                                                   1 o\

2    publicity stunt is an insult to serious science; that's

3    what Bill Dwyer said, right?

4        A   Correct.

5        Q   At the end he says:  If this is the best way

6    the H-E-W secretary can find to fortify his angry

7    attacks, a credibility question is indeed at hand.  His

8    endeavor is subjective, stubborn, and strident.  We

9    rather resent attempts to guess us out of the business.

10    That's what he said, right?

3        Q   Have you ever heard this one: C.B.

4    Ehringhaus, Jr., vice president and counsel for the

5    Washington-based Tobacco Institute, said here today that

6    the 1972 Report of the Surgeon General to Congress on

7    smoking and health insults the scientific community and

8    that the number one health problem is not cigarette

9    smoking but is the extent to which the public officials

10    may knowingly mislead the American public.  That sounds

11    pretty critical, right?

2        talking about this one -- whether he's seen it

3        before --

4             MR. LATHAM:  As a corporate representative,

5        since it wasn't disclosed, yes.

6             MR. McPHARLIN:  Okay.

9        A   In my opinion --

10        Q   You've seen this before, though, right?

11        A   I don't I think have.  I mean, in my opinion

12    this one from '79, to me, has always been the one that

13    was most critical.  Now, that's just my opinion and I

14    have read a lot of them.

15        Q   Right.

16        A   I don't know that I � that I remember reading i /            tridt one in particular, out....

18        Q   Well, let's just assume that this one was

19    issued, right?  Can you -- can you make that assumption

20    for a second?

21        A   I guess, yeah, okay.

22        Q   And if this one was issued, do you think this

23    sounds like an organization that is working side by side

24    with the agency that is charged with developing and     I ^

1    health problem is not cigarette smoking but is the

2    extent to which the public health officials may

3    knowingly mislead the American public?

4        A   It doesn't.  But the Tobacco Institute wasn't

5    meant to work side by side with public health.  Okay?

6    But R.J. Reynolds actually was at that time in '72 -- as

7    you well know, R.J. Reynolds was a full participant in

8    the NCITWG.  So the � the TI wasn't � is an industry

9    group, not a � not a group to try to work with the

10    Surgeon General or other public health groups.

11        Q   But they were speaking, and it was public

12    knowledge that they were speaking on behalf of the

13    industry including R.J. Reynolds?

14        A   They were, yes.

15        Q   So when they say this, R.J. Reynolds is saying 6   this?

17             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

18        A   In general, yes, that is correct.

19        Q   Okay.  That the Surgeon General's office is

20    knowingly misleading the American public; that was the

21    position that the Tobacco Institute and R.J. Reynolds

22    took in 1972, correct?

23             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

2        Q   Okay.  And you've seen --

3        A   Although I don't remember seeing that one in the documents.

6    R.J. Reynolds disapproved of any press release issued by

7    the Tobacco Institute?

8        A   I � I don't know.  No, not that I can � not

9    that I can think of.  Although I haven't dove into TI

10    files to see what may or may not have gone through.

11        Q   Okay.  Now, in addition to issuing press

12    releases, another method of getting the company's public

13    position out is by sending letters to consumers, right?

14             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

15        A   I don't know if that would be the best way to

16    get your public position out, to send letters to

18        Q   I didn't say it was the best way; I said it

19    was one of the ways.

20        A   I don't know that that would be considered a

21    way, but, okay.  I mean, we � did we � did we send

22    letters to consumers? Yes, we did.

3    tobacco or tobacco smoke has a direct causal link with

4    any disease.  That's what T.K. Cahill said, right?

5        A   Correct.

6        Q   The enclosed publications prepared by the

15        Q   The position I just read.

16        A   That was the position, yes.

17        Q   Right.  And no proof that there's any

19    causal link with any human disease, correct?

20        A   That's not exactly what this says.  It is

21    unable to conclusively establish that any substance as

22    found in tobacco or tobacco smoke has a direct causal

23    link with any human disease, and that � that's a true

1    concerned about the charges being made that smoking is

2    responsible for so many serious diseases.  Long before

3    the present criticism began, the tobacco industry made a

4    sincere attempt to determine what harmful effects, if

5    any, smoking might have on human health, established the

6    Council for Tobacco Research-USA.  The industry has also

7    supported research grants directed by the American

8    Medical Association.

9             Over the years the tobacco industry has given

10    in excess of $162 million to independent research on the

11    controversy surrounc}ing smoking � more than all the

12    voluntary health associations combined.

13             Now, the Council for Tobacco Research-USA,

14    R.J. Reynolds was a founding member of that, right?

15        A   They were; along with a number of others, but

16    yes.

18    executives of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company,

12    statistically associated with smoking -- we believe can

13    only be determined through much more scientific

14    research.  That's what they say, right?

15        A   That's what � that's what's said, yeah.

1    wrote Reynolds at some point, said that they were doing

2    some search project.

3        Q   Right.  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company took the

6        A   Right.  Because they were solicited to do so.

7    So, I mean -- I mean, this is � you know, every time --

8    the school letters that I've seen it's been the school

9    has solicited a response from Reynolds and Reynolds has

10    replied.  And basically states what their position is at

11    that given point in time.

12        Q    It would not be unreasonable for R.J. Reynolds

13    to believe that this letter was actually read to the

14    fourth grade class, right?

15             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

16        A   I have � I have no reason to know if it did

17    or it didn't.

18        Q   Right.  But when they're writing a letter

19    to � to a class � a class � a fourth grade class, it

20    would be reasonable for them to assume that the letter

21    was actually read to the class?

22        A   It's possible, yeah.

23        Q   Right.  And so they're telling them that

24    despite many years of extensive research, medical

25    science has been unable to establish that smoking has a

2    they told the class, right?

3        A   Correct.

4        Q    That's what they told fourth graders in 1963?

5        A   Correct.

6             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

7        A   In theory.

8        Q   Well, they didn't in theory tell them that;

9    they actually wrote it, right?

10        A   That's what they wrote.

16        Q   So when we were talking earlier about clearly

21        A    '90, but yes.  In general.  But that doesn't

22    necessarily mean that the position is not complex.

23        Q   Now, it's the position of R.J. Reynolds that

24    R.J. Reynolds has never gone after new smokers, correct?

2     this deposition I have seen the videos, yes.

3          Q   Okay.  You're familiar with this line of

4     question and answers � and correct me if I'm wrong � I

5     want to talk to you just a minute about the position of

6     American Tobacco Company.

7               At the time you first went to work for

8     American Tobacco Company had they already taken a

9    position that smoking � on smoking and health to the

10     effect that cigarettes were not injurious to your

11     health?

iz                                 An swer*  �es.

13                                 Had they taken that position?

15               Is that a position that they maintained

16     throughout your employment with American Tobacco?

17               Answer:  Yes.

18               Would it be correct, then, from 1954 until

19     1980 -- which is approximately the time that he left the

20     company, you understand that, right?

21          A   Roughly, yes.

22          Q   Okay.  He's speaking on behalf of � he's

23     speaking about the company from the time that he was

24     there, correct?                                                                                                  f co

1        Q    So would it be correct, then, from 1954 until

2    1980 it was American Tobacco's position that cigarettes

3    are not injurious to your health?

4             Answer:  That is so.

5             That's what he said, right?

6        A   Correct.

7        Q    At the time that that position was formulated

8    in 1954 based upon your information, who formulated that

9    position for American Tobacco? U                            Answer:  The rormulator and spokesman was the

16        Q   Question:  Would you expect a consumer to rely

7        upon your advertisements?

18             Answer:  Yes, our advertising is truthful.

19             And we anticipate that they would rely on it

20    if they chose?

21             Certainly.

22             Thatfs what he said, right?

23        A   I believe that's correct, yes.

1          Q   And you agree with that as it relates to R.J.

2     Reynolds as well, right?

3          A   I would, yes.

4          Q   And that's the sort � Question:  That's the

5     sort of -- strike that.  Question:  That's sort of a

6     promise for the consumer to expect from your product?

7                Answer:  Yes, I'm sure it is.

8                That's what he said, right?

9          A   It is.

10          Q   And you agree that the same would be true for

11     R.J. Reynolds advertisements?

12                MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

13          Q   Correct?

14          A   In general, yes.

15          Q   Okay.  Throughout your tender -- strike that.

16                Throughout your tenure with the American

17     Tobacco Company, it was not only American's position but

18     your position that cigarettes were not injurious to

19     health; is that correct?

20                Answer:  Through my tenure?

22                Answer:  Yes, that is so.

23                Question:  That's something American wanted

24     the public to believe; is that correct?                                           i en

4        Q   And the same -- and you � the same would be

5    true for Reynolds, correct?

6             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

7        A   I mean, I � I don't � I don't know whether

8    or not a Reynolds' executive would have said the exact

9    same type of thing, but in general I can say the

10    Reynolds' executive would have said we believe our

11    positions and we would believe that consumers have the

12    right to know them and to believe them.

13        Q   Right.

14             Question:  Is that a statement American

15    Tobacco placed great reliance on?

16             Answer:  We issued that statement, yes.

17    Certainly we wanted them to believe.

20        Q   And based on what you know about R.J.

21    Reynolds, R.J. Reynolds felt -- would have felt the same

22    way, that they would have wanted the American public to

23    believe the statements that they made?

24        A   I would think so, yes.

3             That's what he said, right?

6        A   In general, yes.

7        Q   No reason you know of why the public couldn't

8    accept your company's position, is there?

9             Answer:  Well, in the area of scientific

10    integrity, I know of no reason why they should not

11    accept our position.

12             That's what he said, correct?

13        A   I believe so.

14        Q   And you believe the same would be true as it

15    relates to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's position

16    that they took, correct?

17        A    I would, yes.

18        Q   Question:  Would you blame a person for

19    smoking two packs a day?  Would you?

20             Answer:  No.

21             You wouldn't fault him for smoking one pack or

2    two packs; is that correct? 23                            I think so.

7             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

8        A   As to whether or not I blame somebody for

9    smoking one or two packs of cigarettes?  I mean, it's

10    their choice.  It's the consumers' choice on how much

11    they smoke, so, no, I wouldn't.

12        Q   As far as you're concerned, is the Surgeon

13    General simply wrong in concluding that cigarette

14    smoking causes lung cancer?

15             Answer:  I would use the term misguided.

16             That was the question he was asked and that

17    was the answer he gave, correct?

10         A   He did, yes.

11         Q   Okay.  And the opinion of the R.J. Reynolds

12    Tobacco Company at the time was also that the Surgeon ij         uGnsrdi was wrong, correct!.

14         A   I don't know that we would have necessarily

15    had that opinion.  We did not have the same view of what

16    science told us, that's for sure.

17         Q   Now, did the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

18    take advice from their legal department with regards to

19    the subjects that they investigated from a scientific

20    standpoint related to their cigarette products?

9    document?

10        A   I � is it Brown & Williamson or American, I

11    can't remember which.  It could � it could be.  It must

12    be.  Yes, this must be a Brown & Williamson document,

13    because it's London, so it would be to BAT, so I believe

14    it's Brown & Williamson.

15        Q   You believe this to be an authentic business

16    record of Brown & Williamson?

17        A   I have no reason to dispute it.

18        Q   What is Compound W?

19        A   I believe that would be nicotine.  I think

20    that that is their code name for nicotine.

21        Q   Why would they need a code name for nicotine?

22        A   I have no idea since it's so easily

23    deciphered, it seems pretty silly to me.

24        Q   Right, exactly.  Were you able to determine in

25    any of the business records that you reviewed why Brown

1    & Williamson would feel the need to code the word

2    nicotine as Compound W?

3        A   I don't.  And I don't understand it.  I mean,

4    obviously I've seen these documents � this type of

5    document before with this Compound W business, I've

6    never understood it.

7        Q   Have you ever seen a document for Brown &

8    Williamson in which there was an instruction that the �

9    that the term nicotine would not be used and Compound W

10    would be used in its place?

11        A   I mean, I think I have seen that document.  I

12    thought you were asking me why they would do that.  I

13    don't -- I'm not aware of why they would have done that.

14        Q   You don't think they might have been concerned

15    about other people seeing the documents in the future?

16        A   Well, you know, I don't know whether they were

18    decipherable.  I mean, it makes virtually no sense to

19    me.

20        Q   I didn't say they were smart, I just said that

21    they were trying to conceal the term, correct?

2        Q   Okay.  To incorporate -- to study potential

3    designs to incorporate into cigarette products?

4        A   Typically, no.  I mean, most of the IBT stuff

5    that I know that was done was to go out to do animal

6    studies on tobacco products.

7        Q   Right.  In connection with understanding and

8    maybe developing new designs of a product or --

9        A   Mostly to try to get methodologies developed

10    that would be reliable animal models that one could

11    utilize as opposed to � but, I mean, ultimately that

12    would be the end, if you had a good animal model you

13    could test designs, but until you get a reliable animal

14    model it's difficult to test designs.

15        Q   As a result of discussions with Dr. Teague and

16    with Section Heads, the following are suggested as

17    possible IBT undertakings.

9         A   No.  Not that I'm aware of.  I do know where

10    he ended up in his career which was the head of R&D

11    administration where he, you know, kind of made sure

13    of pens and ashtrays and stuff.  I mean, that's how

20         A   At this time ~ I'm sorry, but at this time he

21    was reporting directly to Murray Senkus as his

4    of Research & Development, Dr. Senkus, the programs that

5    Dr. league is suggesting that they work on, correct?

6        A   Well, the Section Heads and with Dr. Teague.

7        Q   Exactly.  Right.  Those are Dr. league's

8    projects that they are suggesting that they work on?

9        A   Well, I can't differentiate between which ones

10    are Dr. league's and which ones are the Section Heads.

21    that came out of some meeting.

22        Q    Number 1 is pH in mouth in response to Turkish

3             Tar is the product of tobacco smoke, correct?

4        A   It is the solid portion of smoke, yes.

5        Q   Yeah, okay.  So in 1971 when you're � when

6    you're considering � you're recognizing that there's --

7    nicotine causes habituation?

8        A   That's exactly what Surgeon General said in

9    '64, correct, and that's what -- Reynolds apparently

10    agrees with that, yes.

13        A    Sorry.

14        Q   That's okay.  When you're talking about

15    nicotine being habituating, the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

16    Company is trying to figure out how low they can go in

17    order to continue to maintain that habituating level,

18    right?

19        A   That was the suggested research.  I don't know

20    that they were successful in making that determination

21    however.

6    they did or didn't do the studies?

2        A   Frank Colby was the head of the library at

4        Q   He's a scientist at R.J. Reynolds, right?

8        A   ultimately he was in charge of the library.

10    librarian, was ever designated by the R.J. Reynolds

11    Tobacco Company as the person with most knowledge in the

12    company regarding smoking and health?

13        A   He was.  I'm not saying he was just a

15    certainly an important scientist at the company for

16    years.

12    authored by Frank Colby, right?

13         A   It is, yes.

4        A   Uh-huh, yeah.

5        Q   They deliver more puffs/ at least 20 percent

6    more.  A fringe benefit which may or may not be

7    promotable, such as � such a cigarette would develop a

8    much less percentage of side stream smoke compared to

9    today's cigarette, right?

10        A   Okay.  Yeah.

11        Q   All right.  So you don't agree that they're

12    ref errincr to how nicotine effects the smoker

13        A   Well, I mean, it says � he's talking about

14    cigarettes that are made in the 1950s, okay.  So those

15    designs would have delivered more tar and more nicotine 6        ana that s what he s talking about, and then more purrs.

17        Q    Right.

18        A   So I don't know how � where we're talking

21        A   Okay.

22        Q    In my judgment for public relations reasons it

23    would be impossible to go all the way back to the

3    in tar and 1.8 milligrams of nicotine.  Still with an

4    old style filter, any desired additional nicotine,

5    quote, kick, end quote, could be easily obtained through

6    pH regulation.  Did I read that correctly?

7        A   You did, yes.

8        Q   Okay.  So Dr. Colby is talking about a very

10    and a certain amount of nicotine in a cigarette, right?

11        A   Well, he's talking about what Pall Mall

12    nonfilter yields, yes.

13        Q   Well, he's saying that that � that that can

14    be achieved, correct?  That precise level?

15        A   In general it could, yes.  I mean, you could

16    certainly design a cigarette to 29 milligrams of tar.

17        Q   And 1.8 milligrams of nicotine?

18        A   Well, I mean, you can probably get close.

9    we can make a projection of what that nicotine value    (

11    measurements that we make.

2        Q   Okay.  Isn't it true that R.J. Reynolds

3    Tobacco Company investigated whether or not the use of

4    ammonia to increase the -- to affect the pH of

5    cigarettes resulted in increased sales of cigarettes?

6        A   I'm sorry?  If the pH?

7        Q   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco -- isn't it true that

8    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company specifically investigated

9    the idea that use of ammonia in their cigarettes could

10    affect pH which would in turn increase their sales of

11    cigarettes?

12        A   Sort of.  There's � there was a theory that

13    if one could increase the pH of smoke that you would

14    increase the amount of free nicotine available, and that

16    that was around at Reynolds in the early '70s, mainly in

17    association with the sales climb of Marlboro and Kool,

18    which were two products that Reynolds believed used

19    ammonia technology in both of those products.  So they

20    had the hypothesis.

22    deconstructed the cigarette and investigated the

23    presence of ammonia in tobacco, correct?

24        A   That's likely, yes.  I'm sure they would have

25    looked for that.  And they � I think they would have

1    believed that there was added ammonia in Marlboro.

2        Q   And they investigated and put into place the

3    design changes based on the investigation regarding the

4    use of ammonia in tobacco, right?

5        A   R.J. � well -- well, I don't know about that.

6    I think R.J. Reynolds looked at developing ammonia

7    technology for its brands and they did do that.

8        Q   And they did that because Reynolds was

9    interested in selling more cigarettes than their

10    competition, correct?

11        A   Certainly Reynolds is in a competitive

12    marketplace, so they were -- they were interested in

-JL <mJ                             X LICjL -J- X m L� O. JL. X X JL LI \-A        !�� X X \3> JL JL         ��) X X Q J�. KJ*       \s JL.        �*? XIL\s JFV. K*Jt JL   O*   �              o L*        L* J. X CL L-r        L* JL XI L*w g

14    Reynolds brands were declining in the marketplace, so

15    they were grasping and looking for reasons as to why

16    that might be the case.

17        Q   They were worried about losing market share to

19                  A   They were, yes.  I would say that's fair.

21    cigarettes?

22        A   Currently, I don't � I don't think so.  There

23    are some alginate compounds that we use in cigarette



24    paper, but the ammonia compounds are found in                        | g

1        Q   Reynolds uses brown sugar in their cigarettes?

2        A   They do, yes.

4    Karen Whitney smoked?

5        A   Possibly, yes.

6        Q   Caramel?

7        A   Caramel? There might be a caramel flavor.

8    I'm not sure that the actual caramel is used.

9        Q   Okay.

10        A   We could look at the ingredients disclosed

11    list.  I don't have it memorized.

12        Q   If any of these are not in any of the

13    cigarette brands that Karen Whitney smoked, let me know.

14    I'm just going to list the ingredients for you, okay,

15    the additives?

16        A   I don't know all the brands that Mrs. Whitney

17    smoked.

18        Q   Okay.

19        A   You know, and, again, going through time

20    things would have changed, so that's why it's not a very

21    easy thing to answer.

22        Q   All right.  So let's just go through these

Chocolate liquor?

9    chocolate liquor that occur naturally in tobacco, so...

10        Q   Is chocolate liquor, is that naturally � does

11    chocolate liquor naturally occur in tobacco?

12        A   Chocolate liquor is not a single compound.

13        Q   Does car- �

1        Q   You said part of it probably does, so which --

2    what part of it are you talking about?

3        A   I don't know.  I don't have the specifics, but

4    at the end of the day most natural products contain

5    commonalities.  Tobacco is a natural product as I'm sure

17        A   And phosphate is in tobacco, so, yes.

18        Q   So you're saying that diammonium phosphate is

19    naturally found in a tobacco plant?

20        A   It might very well be.  Ammonia and phosphate

21    are found in tobacco and they may be found in that salt

22    combination naturally in tobacco.

23        Q   So you're saying that they are?

24        A   I'm not � I'm saying that it's possible that

25    they are.  I know ammonia occurs naturally in tobacco

3        Q   Menthol, that's � that's an additive you put

4    in cigarettes?

5        A   It is, yes.

6        Q   Okay.  That's not naturally occurring in

7    tobacco, is it?

8        A   There is some menthol found in some tobacco

9    plants. 10        Q   Vanilla, do you put that in tobacco -- in your

i        cigarettes.

12        A   It is an additive, yes.

13        Q   That's not naturally occurring in tobacco, is

14    it?

15        A   Again, vanilla is a natural extract, parts of

16    it would be, but, in general, there is some vanillin in

17    tobacco.

18        Q   What -- what's the basis for you to say that

19    there's vanilla in tobacco?

20        A   Because it's vanillin and I know that part

21    of -- when you deconstruct a tobacco plant you will find

1        A    NO.

2        Q   You don't intend to do that at this trial,

4        A   Typically � no, other than what their brand

5    history might be, but, no, with relation to the brands

6    they smoked.

7        Q   What does that mean?

8        A   That's typically what I would offer opinions

9    on is about the brands that they would smoke.

10        Q   Correct.  But what about the brands that they

11    would smoke?

14             MR. McPHARLIN:  I'm asking him.  He just

15        testified that he's going to testify about the

16        brands that they smoked and I want to know �

17             MR. LATHAM:  He is, but this is a corporate

18        rep deposition, now you're transferring it to --

19             MR. McPHARLIN:  I'm not.

20             MR. LATHAM:  We can take another deposition.

21             MR. McPHARLIN:  I'm not � I'm not

22        transferring anything.

23             MR. LATHAM:  Okay.

24             MR. McPHARLIN:  I'm asking him what he intends

10        Q   What is it you intend to testify about the

11    brands?

13    What I would typically testify to would be � would be

14    what I would � what's in my disclosure and what's in my

15    testimony.

16        Q   Which is what?

17        A   With regard to brand history?

19        A   With regard to the history of the brands?

20        Q   What is it that you would typically -- you

1        Q   Okay.  Anything else?

2        A   I could do the history of whatever brands are

3    at issue.  I would do the same type of thing.

4        Q   Just history of the brand?

5        A   How it was designed, what kind of technologies

6    went into it, yes.

13        A   They could or they could be coupons.

14        Q   Right.  They could have put onserts in their

15    cigarettes in the '70s if they wanted to, right?

16        A   I don't know if they could or couldn't.  I

17    don't know.

18        Q   What makes you think they couldn't?

19        A   Technology.  I don't know when the technology

20    was developed, but �

21        Q   Other than the technology.

22        A   Well, I mean, it's kind of hard to put -- to

23    put it in there if the technology isn't developed, but I

24    don't know when that was.

25        Q   Right.  But an onsert is something that R.J.

1    Reynolds has decided � has determined voluntarily to

2    do, right?  They're not compelled to do onserts?

3             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

4        A   Correct.  Yes.

5        Q   It's just a voluntary statement that the

6    company makes about their cigarette product, right?

7        A   In general, yes.  I would say that's -- it's a

8    way to communicate, yes.

9        Q   Right.  They could have commun� ~ they could

10    have -- assuming that they could *"nav*e; developed the

11    technology to do it, they could have done it in the

12    '60s, '70s, '80s and 90s �

13             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

14        Q   � correct?

15        A   I would say they could do it when the

16    technology was available for them to do it.

17        Q    Right.

18        A   You can't go to the moon until you build a

19    rocket to go to the moon.

20        Q   But we're talking about putting a piece of

21    paper inside the cigarette pack.

22        A   Which is not necessarily easy, yes.

23        Q   Okay.  All right.  But that's what the onsert

24    is, it's putting a piece of paper inside the cigarette

25    pack and giving the � giving the consumer some

1    additional information about the cigarette, right?

2        A   Correct.  And what I'm saying is it's not

3    necessarily easy.

4        Q   Right.  But if R.J. Reynolds could have

5    figured out a way to put a piece of paper in a cigarette

6    pack in the 1970s, for example, they could have done

7    that if they had chose to?

8        A   Perhaps.  I mean, you're asking me whether �

9    I don't know when the technology was implemented or

10    developed to put onserts on.

11        q   i  just Said, if they had figured out a way to

12    put a piece of paper inside their cigarette packs they

13    could have done that had they chose to in the '70s?

14        A   As a hypothetical question, yeah.  If they

15    had -- if they had figured out how to do it in the '70s

16    and chose to do it, then, yes, they would have.

17        Q   Right.  And they could have � they could

18    have, for example, on that onsert in the 1960s or the

19    '70s, have instructed their consumers, Do not inhale

20    cigarette smoke, correct?

21             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

22        A   So if they had invented a way to put onserts

23    in the pack and if they had chose to do that and if they

24    had chose to write, Don't inhale the cigarette, could

25    they have done that?  I suppose they could have, yes.

1        Q   Right.  That would have taken just the ability

2    for them to put a piece of paper in the cigarette pack

3    and then the choice to actually decide to do it, right?

4             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

5        A   The choice to � to write the words and to

6    put -- and to put it in?

7        Q   Right.

8        A   Right.  I would not trivialize the onsert

9    technology however.

10        Q   Okay.  Does R.J. Reynolds accept the U.S.

11    Surgeon General as an authority on smoking and health? itL                   i\        i wouiu say SO/ yes.

13        Q   As a leading authority on smoking and health?

14        A   I would say in general, yes.

15        Q   They haven't always accepted the Surgeon

16    General as the leading authority on smoking and health,

17    though, correct?

18             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

19        A   I don't know if they had or not.  Today we

20    certainly would, in the past we might not have agreed

21    with the Surgeon General.

22        Q   We've gone through some documents in which

1    that the Surgeon General was misguided and misleading

2    the public, correct?

3             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

4        A   From what I recall, yes.

5        Q   Okay.  R.J, Reynolds has a responsibility to be honest to the public, right?

7        A   I think so, yes.

8        Q   And they have a responsibility to be honest

9    with the medical community regarding what they say about

10    their cigarette products?

11        A   Yes. lz        Q   And it s your opinion that R.J. Reynolds has

13    always been honest with the public and the public health

14    community, correct?

15        A    I believe so, yes.

17    positions on whether or not smoking causes disease both

18    internally and externally, correct?

19        A   Their internal position and external position

20    were the � would have been the same moving through time

21    although they did change over time.

22        Q   But even though the position � you're saying

23    the position may have changed, but the -- they didn't

24    say something internal and then at the same time say

25    something publicly that was different.

2    has evolved over time.

3        Q   R.J. Reynolds is no longer allowed to use

4    terms like light, low tar, low nicotine in conjunction

5    with advertising their cigarettes, correct?

6             MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

7        A   They're not allowed to use those brand

9        Q   They used them for decades, though, right?

10        A   They did, yes.

11        Q   And the only reason they're not doing it is

12    because they were -~ they are prohibited from doing it?

13        A   The FDA does not allow those brand

14    designations, correct.  We would -- I see no reason why

15    we wouldn't use them were it not for that.

16        Q   What level of toxicants in cigarettes has R.J.

17    Reynolds determined to be too high to safely and

18    responsibly sell cigarettes to consumers?

19        A   I don't know if that level can be established.

20        Q   Okay.  What have they done to determine what

22        a.   I don't know that we've -- that we know what

23    level is too high.  I think what's been done over the

24    years is try to bring those levels down.  So I don't

25    know what would be considered to be too high.  Perhaps

6    significant risks of developing disease in the user in

7    order to responsibly sell the product to consumers?

9        Reynolds has attempted to reduce the toxicant load, but

10    we don't know what that level would be whereby one could

11    make a safe cigarette.

Dr. Kenneth M. Endicott

Director

National Cancer Institute

Bethesda, Maryland 20014

Dear Dr. Endicott:

In your letter of March 6, 1968 you extended to Jne an invitation to serve as a member of an informal working group to develop a "less hazardous cigarette". This group, I understand, is a subcommittee of the Lung Cancer Task Force of the National Cancer lastltute. From the discussion of the meeting held on March 11, 1968, I also understand that the group will concern itself with the development of a cigarette which might be regarded as less hazardous than cigarettes now available from the standpoint of some alleged causal connections between the smoke of such cigarettes and human lung cancer.

I am agreeable to serving on the informal work group referred~to by you and making available ay experience and knowledge in research relating to tobacco and smoking if it is clearly understood that 1 am in no manner accepting the view (1) that present cigarettes are hazardous or Q)  that the smoke of such cigarettes causes or contributes to the development of huaan lung cancer. It is important that this reservation be noted, particularly in light of the unfortunately designated purpose of the group, namely to develop a "less hazardous cigarette". Perhaps a better working arrangement and understanding by all involved could be achieved if the purpose were rephrased in a-manner that would not assume the existence of a "hazard" that has not been scientifically established.

Because of the lack of scientific, experimental or clinical evidence that smoking cigarettes causes or contributes to the development of lung cancer, it seems to me that before meaningful work can be commenced on a "less hazardous cigarette" it must first be established that there i� some causal connection. Only then could truly meaningful work be started to determine any particular causal agent or agents in the.smoke and the Best

method for the eliuination or reduction of such agents. It is possible, of course, pending determination of causation, to analyze smoke constituents and conduct experiments with animals or cellular material, thus perhaps expediting development of an altered cigarette should causation ever be established.

With these reservations, but with a sincere desire to be at assistance as a scientific advisor, X am hopefvl that our relationship on this working group will be such as to encourage further cooperation between the tobacco industry and government. I assure you of our intense interest in helping with what you have aptly described as a "complex problem".

Sincerely yours,

Viewpoint

Ad campaign calls for open debate

Throughout its 109 year history, RJ, ReyiK>!ds Tobacco Company has been a leader of trie (J.S. tolsocco Industry. That leadership has taken many forms � scientific developments, innovative products, advances in technolocry and many others.

in this leadership rote, we have never hesitated wfien faced with a controversial problem, or when everyone else said something could not be done. If wc had, Mr. Reynolds would never have produced Camel hack in 1913 when n nationally advertised, blended cigarette was considered impossible by his competitors.

On Jaa 30, our company took on another tough job, one 1 am sure some people may consider difficult Through a national advertising program (pages Jj 4-5), we began telling the American pub lie that there are otl ler points of view on the issues surrounding the use of tobacco products. We dared to dial* lenge our critics who Iwrve tried to make the public believe tfwrt the so-called case against tobacco is closed on issues such as youth smoking and smoking and health.

The fact is that tr�e questions that have been raised about tte use of tobacco products remain unanswered. For example, 30 years of research about smoking and Ivcatih has produced no scientific proof that tobacco causes disease. It has produced no scientific proof that tobacco smoke is harmful to nansmokcrs.

y



What it has produced are questions that must be answered through unbiased scientific research, the kind of research R J. Reynolds and the tobacco industry have been funding for decades.

Unfortunately, many of tobacco's critics have not been willing to let such research proceed in an orderly, unemotional environment Instead they preach an anti-tobacco gospel that portrays our company and industry as caring only about profit and catlous about the welfare c�f the public. At the same time, they have undertaken campaigns to make those w!k> use tobacco products

'We believe the vast majority of the citizens of this countiy are willing to allow us to present our side of tobacco Issues.1

second-class citizens and social outcasts.

At RJ. Reynolds Tobacco, we believe that this type of anti-tobacco activism represents the views of only a small, but highly vocal, minority. We believe that the vast majority of the citizens of this country are willing to allow us to present our side of tobacco issues. We believe that Ihey not only feel we have a right to present our story, but they want to hear it

Through our new advertising program, we will present a factual, unemotional statement of our positions on many tobacco issues and respond to

the charges tlwt have been leveled against our company and industry. We believe that with such a program, we can help demonstrate that there can be an open debate about these issues.

We believe that by not speaking out more strongly and more often in the past, we have helped foster public mis* understanding about the facts regarding tobacco questions. We also believe that by allowing the public to hear our views, we wiN be allowing them to make truly informed decisions for themselves about the tobacco controversy.

We are aware tltat some of our views will be controversial, but a company that makes any valid claim to leadership of any industry must be willing to step forward when the need is clear.

Canwhave anopend*ate about smoking?

The issues that surround smoking are so complex, and so emotional, it's hard to debate them objectively.

In fact, many of you probably believe there is nothing to debate.

Over the years, you Ve heard so many negative reports about smoking and health�and so little to challenge these reports�that you may assume the case against smoking is closed.

But this is far from the truth.

St udies which conclude that smoking causes disease have regularly ignored significant evidence to the contrary These scientific findings come from research completely independent of the tobacco industry.

We at R J. Reynolds think you will find such evidence very interesting.                             ^

Because we think reasonable people who analyze it may come to see this issue not as a closed case, but as an open controversy

We know some of you may be suspicious of what we'll say, simply because wete a cigarette company.

We know some of you may question our motives.

But we also know that by keeping silent, we ve contributed to this climate of doubt and distrust We may also have created the mistaken impression that we have nothinglosayontheseissues.

That is why we've decided to speak out now, and why we intend to continue speaking out in the future.

During the coming months we will discuss a number of key questions relating to smoking and health. We will also explore other important issues including relations between smokers and non-smokers, smoking among our youth, and "passive smoking."

Some of the things we say may surprise you. Even the fact that we say them may prove controversial.

But we wont shy away from the controversy because, quite frankly, that's our whole point.

We don't say there are no questions about smoking. Just the opposite. We say                     oi

there are lots of questions�but, as yet, no simple answers.                                                      "

Like any controversy, this one has more than one side. We hope the debate                        ^

will be an open one.

Ad campaign draws mixed reaction

"Thank goodness you are finally going to Tight back," wrote a woman from Morganton, fiC

"I admire the motivation that brought it about," said a top executive at Reynolds "Tobacco's fiercest rival.

"I think this campaign is sort of humorous," said an anti-smoking advocate.

"Laughable and ridiculous," were the words of another.

Those were among the many reac-

"I admire the motivation that brought it about"

lions to the company's Jan. 30 launch gv of a national advertising campaign pre ty/ senting Reynolds Tobacco's position on various smoking Issues.

The woman in Morganton was among dozens of people from across the country who called or wrote (he company during the first few days of the campaign. During the two weeks folbwing the announcement, responses were running better than two to one In favor of the compan/s position.

One man tried to call Chairman EA Horrigan Jr. "to congratulate him and to pat him on the back" after his Feb. 3 appearance on the NBC Today shew.

On Today, Horrigan told a national audience, "white there are studies that continue to statistically link us to the diseases that we are accused of causing, there is also a significant body of science that says that tire case against smoking Is stitl an open controversy. And these scientific submissions are, in fad, on file In Congress.'4

iponsored by Reynolds Tobacco cuttt for *n open debate on the Issues.

The night More, Horrigan appeared live on ABCs Ntghtline, a highly regarded national news program that devoted about two-thirds of its one-hour show to the issues addressed by the company's campalga

During that broadcast, Horrigan debated John F. Banzhaf IH, the head of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), an extremely vocal anti-smoking group. Joining r lorrigan and Banzhaf was Dr.Vincent Ouinec, a cancer specialist, who admitted that although he believes smoking causes cancer, neither he nor anyone else knows wiry many smokers do not get cancer.

Through both Interviews, Horrigan reiterated the campaign's premise � "that reasonable people who examine all the evidence concerning smoking and disease would agree this is an open scientific controversy, not a closed case"

Since its announcement, the company's action has attracted a great deal

of attention, including coast-to-coast media coverage, R even prompted praise from a staunch competitor. "I think it's an interesting move and I cer-tainry hope It's effective" said James C. Bowling, senior vice president at Philip Morris Inc. "I admire the motivation that brought it alKHit"

While most of the reaction was supportive, as expected, spokesmen for various organisations that have traditionally taken anti-smoking stands condemned the campaign.

Karen Monaco of the American Lung Association In New York was quoted as saying. "I think this campaign is sort of humorous. They're trying to create a controversy wttere there really Isn't anyf

Charles Dahle, director of media legations for the American Cancer Society In New York, told a reporter that the c ompany s position Is "laughable and ridiculous."

"What they're doing Is investing several milfion dollars trying to convince

Responses were better than two to one in favor of the company's action.

their constituency that there still is a controversy on this issue when, in fact, the controversy was settled years ago" he said.

Despite Dahle's contention that there is no controversy, the (xarnpany's call for "an open debate" on the issues was carried across the country through hundreds of newspaper articles and television and radio broadcasts.

Within hours of its announcement, the campaign generated calls for additional information from such publications as Ihe New ttw* Times, The Chicago Tribune, IheBatUmore Sun, Vie Chartotte Observer, Business Week, Fortune and US, News & Wodd Report

hfonnation was also sought by ABC CBS and NBC television network news, National fabric Radio and Cable News Network. The Walt Street Journal announced the campaign, and stones appeared in hundreds of newspapers that subscribe to the two major wire services, AP and (JP1.

You thought the club was for engineers?

wawawamawawawa^am

Though it has l>een in existence for more than half a century, the Reynolds Engineering Club remains unknown to most employees and a mystery to those who have heard of it.

"We've thought about changing our name, but we don't know witat to call ourselves," says ISobby Brown, former president of the company's oldest club.

What many employees think of as a professional engineering organization is really a social club made up of more than 500 employees representing many positions and departments.

"We have members from all levels of the company, from management to air conditioning specialists to secretaries," says Peggy Boyles, the club's secretary. "And about 150 retirees arc active as well/'

The club was formed in 1930 by R.P, Recce, a chief engineer, "to benefit its members socially, morally, intellectually, physically and otherwise."

"The club was slow growing at first," * says Vodte Gough, a retiree who joined in tiie mkl*30s and is still active at 85. "We didn't have many staff officers. Then we became more organized and began to have more activities."

Qough, who worked in the pipe and plumbing shop before he retired in 1966, doesn't take as many trips with the club as he used to. "But I attend most of the social functions," he says. "It gives rue trie opportunity to slay in touch with old friends, meet younger employees and team about trie company and what's going on,"

Taking trips would be enough to keep members busy. Each year the

6

club sponsors about eight chartered trips. Last year, members enjoyed excursions to Pennsylvania Dutch Amish country, New York City, Washington, D.C, Atlantic City (for the Miss America pageant) and Charleston, S.C

Plans this year caH for trips to Disney World's Epcot Center, Nashville's Opry-land and the WoikTs Fair in New Orleans.

"Most of these are two- or three-day trips, but we take others that are one-day excursions," says Brown. "They include visits to places like the Hot Air Balloon Works at Love Valley near Statesville, the Mmore House and tours of such things as the Celanese Plant In Virginia. Reynolds Tobacco's Central Distribution Center and the Christmas Light Display in McAden-viHe(N.C):*

Most of the chartered bus trips are open to members, their families and their guests.

Other activities include an annual barbecue, an Installation dinner, two golf tournaments each year and various seminars on topics such as finances.

Back to the early '40s, when the men went off to war, some 6 million American women moved from the home to the factory.

They became machinists, mechanics, plumbers, carpenters, welders, lumberjacks, blacksmiths. They dkl any job that needed to be done.

When the war ended, the men returned home. The women, for the most part, also went home, giving their jobs back to the men.

Jan Brown Yard lift operator

"People are usually shocked when I tell them what I do for e living," says Jan Brown. "They usually say, 'A tiny thing Bkeyou?1"

Their response is not surprising. Brown, who weighs 100 pounds, spends her days driving "Big Bertha," a 40,000-pound yard lift at tltc Davie County Processing Plant

As one of six yard lift operators at the plant. Brown transports hogsheads of

to its 32 storage sheds. Her average load is eight hogsheads * about four tons,

Becoming a yard lift operator was more a matter of circumstance than planning, Brown says. Eight years ago, she took a job as a pallet repairer at Brook Cove. She was promoted to fork-Hft operator, and then worked as a hogshead repairer at Shed No. 116.

She didn't much like tlval work, she says, so when she was offered the opportunity to operate a yard lift, she jumped all- That was four years ago.

Although Brown says she enjoys her work, she admits, "f d prefer doing something a little, more fernlnlnc and f d rather be doing something where t could be creatrvkt> : y V -.

But, she adds, "I make a good living and I dc�V$^lfically,know what I'd rather d6."*':;,;i:;VtN;/..     ,:: �/>��'�;.

The bnry thingi about tor Job that realty bothers her rs that people tend to stereotype her when they find out what she does, she says.

"A lot of people thlnk/ph. you*re a women's libber.' But fm not," Brown says. "I'm just out here doing a Job, try. ing to make a livjng. I've got a Sttte girt to support. 7 / ,� >�,'�}��� "�-    �  .'    '' �

Also by 1980, women accounted for about 42 percent of the American workforce, compared to about 18 percent at the turn of the century and 25 percent In 1950.

Other women got Jobs by choice. Some felt the need to achieve. Some were searching for challenges.

For the past several years, an increasingly larger number of women throughout the country have been choosing to do the same types of Jobs that women did out of necessity during World War 11

At Reynolds Tobacco, this trend Is evident The company now employs women as truck drivers, yard lift operators, electricians, machinists, electronics technicians, sales managers. One woman

Rebecca Mlddleton Chief repairer

Eight years ago. when Rebecca Mlddleton was "asked to go out for mechanic," she had no hesitations.

"I said yes," she recalls, "I thought, 'Why not give Ha try? It was a chance to move up"

And move up she has. Last November, when she was offered the opportunity for the fourth time, Mlddleton became the company's first female chief repairer.

"I turned chief down Ihree times because I didn't feel 1 was ready," she notes. "I felt very comfortable with my mechanical abilities, but i felt 1 needed more experience dealing with people because the chief job is a leadership job. You've got to get along well with people to get quality and productivity from them."

As much as she enjoys her work, Mlddleton admits that trie road to the top has not been easy. When she started as a repairer, she wasn't well accepted by her male coworkers and she took a lot of ribbing from them, she recalls.

"At first, they hesitated on calling me," she says. "There were a lot of men that thought a lady couldn't do the job. But after they found out that I could do';' the job, It aN wotted out well." ,� ,

Whether for the challenge, or because of the opportunity to advance, women are working In a variety of fields that were qnce. the sole domain of men.

"I just tike machines, I always have," says Lynda C Ketner, a packing machine repairer at No. 1 Cigarette.

It's not every day a woman gets to do this type of job, and I enjoy IC* says Grace Brewer, a yard Bft operator at Brook Cove. "It's the satisfaction of knowing I can do the job."

Iinda Bolder* Electrician A

Unda Bolden used to be deathly afraid of electricity.

"If a breaker tripped In the basement, I wouldn't touch ft," she recalls. "But now that I understand it, I'm not afraid of Hl I respect it"

Bolden's understanding of electricity can fill a book. In the last six years, she's worked her way up to electrician A She's assigned to R&D Maintenance, but there Isn't an electrical job In the company that she isn't qualified to handle. :  "I didn't think I could do it/' she reflects. "But atllhe men at the shop used to tell me, "You can do It, you can

o j(/leaacvJrbi

do it," and then 1 storied telting myself I could do It I've worked with a tot of good men along the. way,"    /

Bolden's fear of electricity wasn't the only obstacle she had to overcome. She was also afraid of "what people were gonna think when they saw a woman doing electrical work."

That's why it took Bolden's supervisor a year to talk her Into training to < become an electrician's helper.

In 1977, Bolden was under contract, to the company, working as an engraver in the electrical shop. She wanted to get hired as an engraver, but she couldn't unless she qualified as an electrician's helper.

"And then 1 made up my mind that if I was going to school to learn swnething,, ] might os well use it," Bolden says. Now, she wouldn't trade her job for anything.

Computers boost sales efficiency

A lot of electronic games are being ptayed in drug stores, supermarkets and convenience stores these days, but the sound of one computet isn't Tor amusement

In a pilot test of a new reporting system, sales representatives In the Winston-Salem sales region have been using hand-held computers to report their retail activity in each call for the past three months.

'Til admit that 1 was a bit apprehensive at first" says JJA. McLauren, area sates representative in the Charlotte, N.C., division. "Now, I wouldn't be able to get along without my computer."

The computers are programmed to assist sales representatives in each step of their calls, recording and displaying data such as inventory, advertising activity, and package and carton fixture placements.

"After an initial training session, it took about three days to get contort-able with it," says McLauren. "The computer is a big help in being able to pinpoint trouble spots In some cafe right away."

Are* Sates ReprtscnUlfoc Jhckfe McUmren record* Inventory, *tiuetVs(ng and ether cart datm In her hand-held computer In a Charlotte grocery store*

At U>e end of each day, sales representatives plug their computers into a modem (a telephone coupling device) which transmits data by telephone to a host computer in Winston-Salem Their activity reports are available to Field Sales managers the next day, through a video display terminal In the manager's office.

"We're very excited about the advantages of the new system," says Sam Hendrix, Winston-Salem regional sales manager. "Before, reporting involved a lot of paper work, sending that paper work by mail and having the data avail-

able two weeks after the activity. Now It happens overnight."

"The system benefits everyone," says Yancey Ford, vice president � Sales Operations. "It improves the sales representative's efficiency in each call. H allows division managers overnight access to sales activity in their division. And it puts our company years ahead of competition with immediate access to marketplace information."

The company is expected to begin a national rollout of the system In April.

FOR RELEASE TO AMs AND PMs OF MONDAY, JANUARY 30*

WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. � A series of advertisements dealing with a variety of public issues about smoking was launched today by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.

The advertisements, which will discuss R.J. Reynolds* point of view on such subjects as passive smoking, youth smoking, smoking courtesy and smoking and health, will appear in various national newspapers and news magazines in the coming months.

"We recognize that some of the messages will be controversial," said E.A. Horrigan Jr., chairman of the board. "But we believe that by not speaking out more frequently over the years, we have led people to believe we have nothing to say, and that is not the case.

"By stating our position on these issues, Reynolds Tobacco is adding another dimension to the tobacco industry's communications effort. We want to try and substitute rational discussion for the emotionalism currently surrounding smoking.

"We believe, for example, that smokers and nonsmokers can work out their relationships with each other through mutual cooperation and consideration without legislative interference,n he said.

Horrigan said the company believes the public not only has a right to hear, but also wants to hear, its side of these issues.

"The question of smoking by youth is ah excellent example of the need to communicate our position," he said.  "Some anti-smoking activists have attempted to make the public believe R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company encourages smoking by young people. The truth is that our long-standing position has been that smoking is an adult custom, and we do not believe young people should smoke.

"There is also need for further understanding of the company*s views on other smoking issues," Horrigan said.  "We recognize there are statistical studies that have led some to claim that smoking causes some diseases. There are other studies that raise questions about these claims. The unfortunate fact is that scientists do not know the causes of the diseases statistically linked to smoking.

"The tobacco industry, government health agencies and private health agencies have funded smoking and health research for 30 years. After all of this study, there are many scientists who believe there is no laboratory or clinical proof that cigarette smoke does -� or does not � cause disease," he said.

"There are, however, numerous questions that need to be answered. We believe this can best be done through continued objective scientific research into the causes of the diseases statistically linked to smoking."

During the last three .decades, R.J, Reynolds and the tobacco industry have spent more than $110 million in support of independent scientific research at many leading medical institutions, searching for answers to smoking and health questions. And the industry continues to spend more for such research each year than all of the private health agencies combined�

*We believe that reasonable people who examine all the evidence concerning smoking and disease would agree this is an open scientific controversy, not a closed case.

"We recognize that it is going to be tough to overcome years of one-sided communications," he said.  "But we have confidence in the ability of people to reason after they have been presented with all points of view."

Can we have anopen debate about smoking?

The issues that surround smoking are so complex, and so emotional, its hard to debate them objectively.

In fact, many of you probably believe there is nothing to debate.

Over the years, you've heard so many negative reports about smoking and health*�and so little to challenge these reports�that you may assume the case against smoking is closed.

But this is far from the truth.

Studies which conclude that smoking causes disease have regularly ignored significant evidence to the contrary These scientific findings come from research completely independent of the tobacco industry.

We at RJ. Reynolds think you will find such evidence very interesting. Because we think reasonable people who analyze it may come to see this issue not as a closed case, but as an open controversy.

We know some of you may be suspicious of what we'll say, simply because we're a cigarette company.

We know some of you may question our motives.

But we also know that by keeping silent, we've contributed to this climate of doubt and distrust. We may also have created the mistaken impression that we have nothing to say on these issues.

That is why we've decided to speak out now, and why we intend to continue speaking out in the future.

During the coming months we will discuss a number of key questions relating to smoking and health. We will also explore other important issues including relations between smokers and non-smokers, smoking among our youth, and "passive smoking."

Some of the things we say may surprise you. Even the fact that we say them may prove controversial.

But we won't shy away from the controversy because, quite frankly, that's our whole point.

We don't say there are no questions about smoking. Just the opposite. We say there are lots of questions�but, as yet, no simple answers.

Like any controversy, this one has more than one side. We hope the debate                   ^

will be an open one.                          ____                                       ^^          ___       c*j

STAIEMOT W BILL DTCH, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE, AT A SEWS COKTEREHCE OM SMOKING & HEALTH, VASHDETOH, DC, 'WEDHESDAI, JANUARY. 10, 1979

Tb� release of a new Surgeon General's Heport on S&ol&ig on the 15th anniversary of the first one suggests it will be more rehash, than research. Science doesn't time its findings.

It was suspect froa the start. KEV Secretary Califano launched his anti-sacking caapaign a year ago with ail the zeal of a reformed sinner.

la an apparent attempt to bring soae science to the side of his new evangeliaa, the former three-oack-a-day Secretary told the Surgeon General to prepare a new 3epcrt. Its issuance, an internal HEM skew said, "would be a media event." Turning a significant health question into a publicity stunt is an insult to serious scienca.

America beware if Joe Calif ano ever jives up drinking or other pleasure pursuits�even the most intimate.

. But, it isn't so ouch this schema to grab tise and space for Califano's cigarette condemnation that Is troubling, it's the more important issue of credito ilitv

The Surgeon General's office said in its own consideration of a new Report: teaching scientific consensus could be difficult however because of'the controversial nature of several of the issues involved.B

Would he allow the views of those who disagree with his mindset on smoking to be heard? Repeated attempts on our part to learn what path would be followed in a new Report got the back of the federal heed.

What about those inside HEW reporting results seen as damaging to the Calif ano canpaign? The lesson of Dr. Gcri's "less hazardous" cigarette research stands as a warning to those vha would avoid Siberia.

Can his public statements be trusted? The HEW Secretary told the news media in Connecticut that one billion dollars of the 13 billion spent each year in^Social Security disability payments is for diseases caused by cigarette socking.

Yet, what we obtained in response to our Freedom of Information request fails to support that figure, la short, the Secretary's own tureaucracy called it into the doubt it deserves. He chose to ignore them. Social Security officials gave hia such cautions as "No data. is readily available...reasoning depends on broad-brush assumptions...sore appropriate data is lacking."

If this is the best way the HEM Secretary can find to fortify his angry attacks, a credibility question is indeed at hand. ^nC^*                                         u\

Dear Ms. Licbomiani

Thank you for your interest in our company and the industry of which we tire a partt It va* good of you to take the time to share your thoughts vith us.

Research on all phages of tobacco use his been substantially supported by our industry for mnny yeare through grants administer cd by The Council for Tobacco Rcaearch-~U.S.A. and the American Medical Association.

While a number of theories similar to yours have been reported in the press, medical science hoe been unable to conclusively establish that ony substance as found in tobacco or tobacco smoke has a direct causal link with any human disease.

The enclosed publications prepared by The Tobacco Institute in Washington, D. C, present the tobacco industry's position and tell about the ongoing research into questions relating to smoking and health.

Many thanks for calling, and best wishes from all of us at R. J. Reynolds.

Dear Sir or Mtdamt

A number of your fifth grade itudente hava written R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company eowmanting that they do not faal our company should allow tha uaa of our brand namee on childran'a toy a and candy cigarettes.

As information, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's policy ia not to allow our brand nanaa to ba used on toy* or candy cigarettes and any currant uaa of our brand naiat in this faehion is not sanctioned by our company.

Soma of tha atudants also Commented about tha controvariias surrounding cigarette smoking* Tht tobacco Industry considers smoking to ba a custom for tboaa adults who darlva plaasura from it. Ha baliava that whether to smoke or not is a dacision that ahould ba fraaly made by individuals who hava reached tha age of mature Judgment. Accordingly, our advertising is dirsctad to adult smokere and not younger paopla.

Tha tobaeoo Industry is also eoncamad about tha charges being nade that sicking is responsible tor so many serious diseases. Long before the present critic 1st* began, the tobacco industry, in a ssnoere ittenpt to determine what harmful effects, if any, snoking sight have on human health, established The Council for Tobacco Reaearch�USX. The industry has also supported reeearch grants directed by the American Medical Association. Over the years ths tobacco industry has given in excess of $163 million to independent research on the controversies surrounding smoking � more than all the voluntary health aesociitions combined *

Despite all the research going on, the simple and unfortunate fact ia that aciantists do not know the cause or causes of tha chronic diseases reported to be associated with smoking. The

Fourth Graders, Rooj 22 Gelger School Tacoma, Washington

Dear Students:

Thank you for thinking of us In connection with your school research project.

As you know, opinions regarding smoking are by no weans uniform. Our feeling has always been that smoking is a pastime for adults and that young people should not smoke. Whether or not adults choose to smokers, of course, a matter of individual preference.

I.onj* hefore the advent of the current anti-nir.oking campaigns, our industry established the Council for Tobacco Research to support independent scientific research in a sincere attempt to determine what adverse effects, if Any, Booking has upon hurcan health. Moreover, funds have been appropriated by our industry for tobscco and health research grants being arfniniatered by the American Medical Association. To date, over $22 million has been contributed by our industry to support research related to smoking and health.

Despite many years of extensive research, medical science has been unable to establish that smoking has a direct causal link with any human disease. Me are firmly of the opinion, however, that definite answers to the many unanswered sraoking and health questions�and the true causes of human diseases�can be determined only by scientific research. Our Company intcndn, therefore, to continue to support such research until the truth is known,

1 trust that these comments, and the enclosed naterials, will help you to understand our position on this matter,

Sincerely,

Inter-office Memorandum

Date;   October II, 1978

To:  Dr. Chin K. Lee

From: Alan Rodgman

1 discussed with Mr. Hax Crohn (legal) your September 20 memo on our Ames Testing Program, your proposal, and the specific advantages of Investigating tobacco smoke condensate fractions (Including deMcotlnized smoke condensate).

Hr. Crohn retains adamant that Investigation of the mutagenicity of tobacco smoke condensate fractions 1s unwise from a legal point of view. To conduct such experiments will compromise the philosophy of our defense against claims raised 1n the smoking-health Issue.

This refusal and the reasons for It parallel previous ones by Legal to permit study of smoke condensate fractions in mouse skin painting experiments. In fact. Legal has been and Is even unwilling to permit derlcotlnlzatlon of whole smo^e condensate prior to study of Its effect 1n mouse skin painting or mutagenicity studies.

In accordance .with legaVs wishes and reasons, permission tu examine the mutagenicity of smoke condensate fractions and dcnicotmiied tobacco smoke condensate Is refused.

Dear Derek:

Since your recant visit, we have successfully coupleted a series of fectory-level tests involving the use of tha addltlva mentioned In yotrr lattar of June 11 end which we vill rafar to aa * Compound W."

In preparing experimental cigarette bland* Incorporating a significant aatoune of extended reconstituted tobacco. It wa* our desire that tha 'V level of tha finished cigar*tta remain constant.    To maintain tha V level� two approaches ware evaluated:    (1) addition of Compound W during aenufscture of reconstituted tobacco; and (2) addition of "W" to the casing solution which la applied to the tobacco daring processing at the cigarette factory.   White both aethoda of addition appear practicable! we are currently leaning toward the tobacco casing method.

Compound W U converted to the oalate salt (WM) before use by reacting (V" and oaltc acid In a nole-to-raole ratio.   With regard to our production Of 'V,** we believe that availability through conraarctet sources is such that It would be more practicable to proceed in this way, �eenwhlls continuing our production studies.   We have found a source which produce* Che "W" additive in fairly large quantities from natural plant msterial.

In the reconstituted tobacco approach, the desired level of WM va* added to the tobacco extract during reconstituted tobacco manufacture.    Thie Is a very simple method of addition and no problems were encountered.    By varying the WM level in the RC, we could easily maintain the particular cigarette blend involved at the desired level of *M,H   Although this is

Re:    Possible IBT Projects

As a result of discussions with Dr. Teague and with Section Heads, the following are suggested as possible IBT undertakings.

1."   pH in mouth in response to Turkish smoke� burley smoke, and various components, e.g., ammonia, nicotine, etc.

2.    Absorption of nicotine in mouth vs. lungs (blood levels, urine levels).

3.    Difference in nicotine impact from free nicotine and bound nicotine; effect of pH of smoke (blood levels, urine levels, smoking tests).

4.    Habituating level of nicotine (How low can we go?)

5.    What factors important to mouth moistness (menthol, salivating agents, humectants, coating agents, etc.)?

6.    Pattern of deposition of tar (mouth, airways, etc.)

Subject:    CIGARETTE CONCEPT TO ASSURE RJR A                                             Date:     December 4,  1973

LARGER SEGMENT OF THE YOUTH MARKET

To:    Hr. R. A. Bievlne, Jr.                                                               From:     Frank G- c�H>y

Director, Marketing Planning

Summary:

It is suggested to develop a new RJR youth-appeal brand based on the concept of going back - at least halfway - to the technological design of the WINSTON and other filter cigarettes of the 1950*a.

Memorandum:

This will aunnarlxe the suggestions that I made to you by telephone yesterday.

It Is apparently established beyond a doubt that Philip Morris* Marlboro cigarette has a much stronger hold on the up and coning new generation of smokers than WINSTON or our other brands, it seems to me that a "oe too" brand stands very little chance of changing this situation. What is needed la a new concept.

Another condition seems to me to be a need to be able to develop such                                    /

a cigarette for the immediate future and not many months hence*

My suggestion covers all these conditions.  It is basically to go back                                  �

as much as possible - probably at least halfway - towards the old filter                                      {

cigarettes, 1. e., the cigarettes of the 1950'e prior to the Surgeon

General's Report. These cigarettes had the following three naln character-                                *

istlcs as distinguished from today's cigarettes:

1.  They delivered more flavor (tar).

2.  They delivered more "enjoyment" or "kicka" (nicotine).                                                  �

3.  They delivered more puffs - at least 20Z more. (A fringe                                           5 benefit which may or may not be promotable is that such a,

cigarette would develop a much less percentage of sldestreaa                                    <,

smoke cot.4 jred to today's cigarette. This decrease would                                         \

be roughly in proportion to the increased number of puffs.                                         )

The reasons for these differences are not so much between the tobacco of today and that of the 50'a, but the paper (much more porous today) and the filter material (much more absorbent today).

In my judgment, for public relations reasons it would be impossible to go back all the vay to the 1955 type cigarettes. As far as tar and nicotine in the smoke are concerned, I believe it should be possible to achieve the desired effect by going to a tar level of today's Pall Mall (non-filter type) of about 29 mg tar and 1.8 mg nicotine. Still, with an old atyle filter, any desired additional nicotine "kick" could be easily obtained through pH regulation.

Mr. R� A, Blevtns, Jr.

2

December At 1973

To sunroarize, it should be easy to develop* within a relatively few weeks, these new youth-appeal cigarettes for market testing for which the following advertising claims could be unequivocally proven: They will deliver oore flavor, more enjoyment, and more puffs for the money than any large selling cigarette on the Market, or for that natter, than any other cigarette now on the market.

it is sty understanding that a very limited number of cigarettes of the 50't are available from a scarce supply for test comparison purposes from the Tobacco Development Department (Tom Eskew or Del Johnson).

In our conversation yesterday, you mentioned that you were just then trying to develop a concept for a new brand appealing to the old CAMEL and other old type cigarette smoker except having a filter. 1 believe that the concept outlined above can also be need for an old timers* brand with possibly a somewhat different top dressing formula.

	MR. MCPHARLIN:  So my question is, are

	you now in your own deposition?

7
	MR. LATHAM:  I think it's both.

8
	MR. MCPHARLIN:  Well, it can't be both.

9
	So which one is it?

10
	MR. LATHAM:  I think it's both.

11
	MR. MCPHARLIN:  It can't be both.  You

12
	can't be �

	MR. LATHAM:  I'm not going to start

	MR. MCPHARLIN.  you can't --

16
	MR. LATHAM:  I'm only going to ask

17
	questions in one line.

18
	MR. MCPHARLIN:  You can't conduct your

19
	own deposition and also be conducting a cross

20
	examination.  So either you � either you're

21
	in my cross -- you're doing your � a cross

22
	of your own witness.

MR. MCPHARLIN:  I'm objecting to -~

you're characterizing ~~ my objection is to the characterization of that way.  So I don't

MR. LATHAM:  There's no way to solve your problem because I don't want to ask: him the same questions twice.

MR. MCPHARLIN:  Well --

MR. LATHAM:  So � so in the interest of trying to complete the deposition rather than having to ask him identical questions twice � I think these questions are all going to be within the scope of your examination.  If they're not, the Judge can

part of my direct.  And you can disagree on

MR. MCPHARLIN:  All right.  So I object to that process that you're trying to employ because it doesn't enable me to do what I'm trying to do in a deposition.

MR. LATHAM:  I think it does.

MR. MCPHARLIN:  So will you give me a standing objection to outside the scope?

MR. LATHAM:  Yes.

16
	job working for a cigarette company was working

17
	for the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation;

1        Q   What is a reduced-harm project?

2        A   It's trying to investigate

3   scientifically are there ways to reduce toxicants

4   in smoke, for instance, and what means could one

5   employ to do that.  Studying combustion is one of

6   the first projects I worked on.  I tried to

7   understand how toxicants are formed in smoke with

8   the hope that if you know what the mechanism is,

9   you might be able to do something to interrupt

10   the formation.

11        Q   During the entire time that you worked

12   at Brown & Williamson, did you work on

13   harm~*reduction�*related projects?

14        A   I did, yes.

15        Q   When you joined R.J. Reynolds, did you

16   continue to work on harm-reduction projects?

17        A   I have, yes.

18        Q           Can you give the jury some of the major

19   areas that you've worked on in your career 2 0      related to harm reduction at B&W and R.J.

21   Reynolds.

22      A   Sure.  I have a -- certainly have a

23  patent on a selective filtration in smoke.  I've

24  worked on selective filtration and reduced

25  specific toxicants in smoke.  I helped generate

1  the brand Advance for Brown & Williamson, which

2  was a potentially reduced-exposure product. At

3  Reynolds I've worked on the Eclipse brand, which

4  is a potentially reduced-exposure product cigarette.  I nave directed the research or

6  others.  I continue to direct the research of

7  others in harm reduction, whether that being in

8  filtered development or new tobacco-blending

9  techniques or different types of reconstituted

10  tobacco.  So I've worked on a number of things,

11  including plant breeding as well.

12      Q   Was the research that you did at B&W and

14  related to trying to reduce the inherent risk of

15  cigarettes?

16      A   That's correct.  Yes.

17          MR. MCPHARLIN:  Objection to form.

18      Q        Today does the Reynolds Tobacco Company

19  maintain an Internet website?

20      A   We do, yes.

22  tell the public what its positions are on various

23  issues related to smoking and health?

24      A   We do.

(Off-the-record discussion.)

THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're back on the

Q

	MR. LATHAM:  Okay*

	Does this screen shot say that Reynolds'

position
	is that no tobacco product has been

shown to
	be safe and without risks?


	MR. MCPHARLIN:  Objection to form.

ri
	Yes, it does.

Q
	Is that on your current website?

A
	Yes, it is.


	MR. MCPHARLIN:  Object to form.

Q
	If you'll turn to the next screen shot,

it's ANS
	1324 Dem-16.  Your website states

quitting smoking significantly reduces the risk
	
for serious diseases; is that right?
	
r\
	Yes, it does.

15
	Q   What is the con^>anyis position about

17
	A   It says, "Nicotine in tobacco products

18
	is addictive but is not considered a significant

19
	threat to health."

general reduction, selective reduction, tobacco

heating, and tobacco substitutes, those large

research areas to try to address the health --

potential health consequences from smoke.

Q   What is general reduction?

i

A   General reduction means you want to reduce everything all at the same time.  So we're getting basically all the toxicants and carcinogens down at once.

Q   What does selective reduction mean?

A Selective would mean to try to target a specific compound or class of compounds in order to reduce their yields to the smoker.

Q   What is tobacco heating?

A   Tobacco heating is -~ it's been found through research that many toxicants are formed because tobacco is burned.  So if one could generate an aerosol by heating tobacco as opposed to burning it, then you will not form certain

Q   What's the scientific basis for why Reynolds was trying to reduce tar and nicotine yields?

A   Well, the scientific basis was that tnere was an association oetween cigarette smoking and disease.  And the scientific basis was one of the toxicological premises that the dose -- that there was a dose response to the epidemiology.  So if one could reduce the yield of products, then you would be reducing the dose. So it was a likely premise that if the � if you could reduce the overall dose, then one would

Objection to the form of the last question. BY MR. LATHAM:

Q   Will you explain what that i impact was. A   Yeah.  The impact was that the public health community felt that there was a dose response to the epidemiology at the timer so, therefore, that was an indication that lower tar products would be better. And certainly those recommendations were made by the public health community over � over a couple of decades, frankly � several decades actually.

Q   You were asked some questions about Reynolds' position on whether smoking had been scientifically established to be a cause of lung cancer.  Do you recall those questions?

A   I do, yes.

Q   And will you explain for the jury the

historical progression of Reynolds' position on whetner smoking had been shown to cause lung

cancer.

MR. MCPHARLIN:  Objection to form. A   Yes, I can.  Starting in the 1950s, early epidemiological reports were coming out and around 1950, that showed an association.  In addition to that, there were some animal studies that were done showing that painting cigarette smoke condensate on the backs of mice could produce tumors.  So there was a lot of conversation around and public debate around whether or not cigarette smoking and that association was enough to say that it was a cause of disease. And that was debated all through the 1950s in the public health community.

At that time Reynolds did not believe that their products were injurious to health, as

Page 353 they stated in public. Come- into 1964 time

frame, the Surgeon General had a committee that did research on the whole tobacco and health debate area and concluded, based on their report, that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer, at least in men at that time.  The basis by which that conclusion was rendered was � was mainly based on -- on the epidemiology.  And Reynolds at that time would have felt and did feel that epidemiology was not traditionally what one would base a cause and effect relationship on, that prior to what the Surgeon General had said, prior to that, in order to prove cause and effect, one had to have a number of clinical lines of evidence, experimental lines of evidence that were consistent such as having a mechanism by which that disease would progress in a human being, have animal models that were � that were developed and reliable that one could use for testing on those hypothesis, as well as having a good understanding about what the causative agents might be in this case in cigarettes that would � that would cause that disease.  Those lines of evidence were � were lacking in '64. So the � Reynolds would not have agreed.  They

Page 354 would � they would have recognized that the

association was there and the statistics were

sufficient enough proof to -- to say cause and effect.  And that position was maintained roughly into the 1980s when Reynolds began using risk factor analysis.  So epidemiology became a much more popular tool.

Statistics � the power � the statistics were much more -- a tool that was used much more in the medical community.  And so those terminology � that terminology was adopted in the 1980s.  And then certainly in the 1990s it was a major risk factor, that would have been Reynold's position. And finally in 2000f because of the complexities and the issues as to why Reynolds wouldn't say cause and effect because of the -- the science and the complexity of trying to explain that, I think Reynolds' position was misunderstood.  And they basically altered their position in 2000 and said it's basically a cause of lung cancer.

11  questions in � in Mr. McPharlin's examination

12  about a note from Dr. Rodgman to Dr. Lee about

13  testing the mutagenicity of smoke fractions.  Do

14  you recall those questions?

15      A   I do, yes.

16      Q   Did Reynolds' scientists do mutagenicity

17  testing of cigarette smoke fractions?

18      A   They did, yes.

19      Q   I've handed you what I'm marking as

20  Exhibit 20, a January 18th, 1983, memo from Chin

MR. MCPHARLIN:  Objection to form.

A   It could likely have more.  I mean, it's � there's no diluents in roll-your-own tobaccos typically.  And if you grew tobacco in your back yard, you would not have the things that Reynolds' cigarettes have in them that dilute tar and nicotine, so they're likely to have more.

Q   You were asked a number of Questions about cigarette ventilation holes.  What are cigarette ventilation holes and why does Reynolds use them?

A   Cigarette ventilation holes are literally holes that are in the filter and they are used to draw air into the cigarette to dilute the smoke so that you can lower tar and nicotine yields.

Q   Do filter ventilation holes � are they effective at reducing tar and nicotine yields?

A   Sure.  Yes, they are.

Q   Has Reynolds studied or researched

MR, MCPHARLIN:  Objection to form.

A   The '64 Surgeon General's report concluded - I believe it was in chapter 13 or chapter 14, those are the two chapters devoted to nicotine. They said that the nicotine in cigarettes was a drug of habituation.

Q   Did the '64 report look at � at that exact (Question, whether it was proper to classify cigarette smoking as addictive or habituation?

A   Yes.  I spent a great deal of time actually explaining it.

19       Q   You were shown a document that was

20  titled Possible IDT Projects, it was Exhibit 12,

21   by Mr. McPharlin.  Do you know whether or not

22   Reynolds ever hired the IDT Lab to do research on

23   a habituating level of nicotine?

24        A   I don't believe they did.  I've never

25  seen any further reports on that.

4       A   I would argue that they're � that

5   they're two different things, but I don't � I'm

6   unaware that science has been able to establish

7   what the addictive threshold is of nicotine in a

8   cigarette product or in a tobacco product.

9       0   Do you know of any test that you can

10  perform on a cigarette to determine the addictive

11   level of nicotine in a particular cigarette?

12       A   Not that I'm aware of, no.

13       Q   You were shown a document that was

14   authored by a Dr. Colby about a new cigarette

15  brand.  Do you recall that?

16       A   I do.  Yes, I recall the document.

17       Q   Have you researched Reynolds' documents

18   in history to determine whether or not Reynolds

19   ever followed Dr. Colby's recommendation in that 2 0     memo?

21       A   Yes, I have looked at that.

22      Q   And what is the results of that

2  the way it was made in the '50s.

3      Q   Was Dr. Colby ever in charge of product

4  development in R.J. Reynolds?

5      A   No, he was not.

6      Q   Was Dr. Colby trained as a cigarette

7  designer and product developer?

8      A   He was not trained as such, no.

9      Q   You were asked a number of questions

10  about ingredients in various Reynolds brand

11  cigarettes.  What does Reynolds do with respect

13      A   What does it do?  It will use

14  ingredients in cigarettes and of course we

15  steward those ingredients for ~ to try to

16  determine if -- that the inherent risks of

17  cigarette smoking are not increased by the use of

18  any particular ingredient.  And that's how you

19  judge how much of a particular ingredient one

20  would -- one would use in a cigarette product.

21      Q   Does Reynolds have a formal program for

22  product stewardship that applies to all the

23  ingredients it uses in its products?

24      A   It does, yes.

25             Q        Historically has Reynolds disclosed all

2  cigarettes to the Federal Government?

3      A   They have done so, yes, since 1986.

4      Q   Who did it disclose that information to

5  in 1986?

6      A   To the Health and Human Services, and

7  has done every -- every year.

8      Q   Today does Reynolds disclose all the

9  ingredients that it uses to the FDA?

10      A   Yes, we do.

11      Q   Has the Department of Health and Human

12  Services or the FDA ever told Reynolds that any

13  of the ingredients it uses in its cigarettes

16      Q   With respect to Reynolds' commercial

17  cigarettes that it's sold over time starting from

18  the 1950s to the president *"~  to the present, do

19  you have an opinion as to whether or not those

2          MR, MCPHARLIN:  Objection to form.

5  presentations that you gave to the Massachusetts

6  Department of Public Health, the representative

7  of the Department of Health, the CDC, and the

8  FDA, and the National Association of Surgeon

9  General. What was the subject matter of those

10  presentations?

11          MR. MCPHARLIN:  Objection to form.

12      A   The subject matter of almost all those

13  presentations is around harm reduction and what

14  types of technologies one could use to try to

15  accomplish that. The FDA presentation was

16  specifically -- touched on that, but was also a

17  general cigarette design presentation as well.

correlated with sales of those cigarettes over time?

MR. MCPHARLIN:  Objection. A   I have, yes.  I've looked at a number reports on that subject, yes.

Q   And is the use of ammonia in Reynolds' products � was it correlated with sales over the long term?

A   No, it's not correlated.  In fact, Reynolds' sales continued to decline after the use of ammonianized products, so they don't correlate with better sales.

Q   Does the use of ammonia give smokers exposure to more nicotine?

A   No.  No, it does not. Q   Does the use of ammonia give smokers exposure to nicotine that gets to the brain faster than it otherwise would? No, it s not feasible. MR. MCPHARLIN:  Objection to form. MR. LATHAM:  I don't have any more questions.

this screen shot is, "Minors should never use tobacco products."

Q   Okay.  That's a statement � that's a public-purported statement of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company that's included on the website shot that Mr. Latham showed you.

A   It is not in the call-out, no, but, I mean, it's in the -- it's in the background, yes.

Q        Okay.  Well, it's on the document, correct?

A   It is, yes,

Q   Okay.  But Reynolds has, in fact, over the years diligently sought to get minors to smoke their cigarette products, correct?

4  BY MR. MCPHARLIN:

5      Q   Okay.  One of the principles that �

6  that Reynolds claims on their website is not

7  marketing to youths, but you know for a fact

8  based on the documents that you have reviewed

9  that Reynolds has, in fact, encouraged and sought

10  teenagers in the 12- to 14- to 17-year-old range

11  to smoke their products.

12          MR. LATHAM:  I'm going to object to

13      Dr. Figlar did not prepare to answer those

And now you're wasting your time.  So we're going to be gone in one minute.  So why don't you ask questions about the topics and you can go to the Court and ask whether or not you get time to depose him on underage smoking, which I don't think you will because he's not a representative on that.

Page 392 MR. LATHAM:  What topics do you want to

examine on besides underage smoking?

MR. MCPHARLIN: Well, I'm going to go through the questions that you asked,

MR. LATHAM:  What topics?

MR. MCPHARLIN: What do you mean what topics? I'm going to cover the stuff you just asked him about. You asked him �

MR. LATHAM:  That's not the stuff I asked him about.  You brought out � you brought underage marketing out right at the beginning.

MR. MCPHARLIN:  I'm going through the areas that you raised with him right now.

MR. LATHAM:  We're going to have to adjourn the deposition and reschedule.  We're not going to miss our plane.

MR. MCPHARLIN:  The first one I'm going to is the Federal Register that you showed him.  So you're telling me I can't ask him about the Federal Register?

MR. LATHAM:  No.  I'm saying you can ask him about the Federal Register, of course, because I used it.

MR. MCPHARLIN:  So let's go.

1          MR. LATHAM:  We have � we're not going

2      to miss our plane.  Our plane is at 7:54.

3      We've got to get there.

4          MR. MCPHARLIN:  Okay.  First of all, I

5      missed my plane because of this deposition,

6      all right? So I am stuck here tonight. The

7      first time you said anything to me was five

8      minutes ago.

9          DR. FIGLAR:  Can we take two minutes for

10      a bio break?

11          MR. MCPHARLIN:  Yes.

12          THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We're off the record

13      at 6:33,

14           (Recess from 6:33 p.m. to 6:35 p.m.)

15          MR. MCPHARLIN:  I was � I waited in

16      Winston-Salem for Dr. Figlar and there was

17      nothing stated from after � it was like 5:30

18      in the afternoon until like � 8:30 yesterday

19      morning was the first time that anybody said

20      anything to us that he was not appearing and

21      I waited in Winston-Salem for him.  So then I

22      had to fly here so we could take his

23      deposition.  And five minutes � actually at

24      the end of your direct examination, you tell

25      me I have a couple minutes to examine him.

Page 394 That's extremely unprofessional and it is not

how this deposition should have been

conducted, all right?

Now, I have gone through hoops to take his deposition.  I've waited in Winston-Salem to take his deposition.  I have missed my flight back home because of this deposition and I am stuck here tonight.  So I don't see why Dr. Figlar or you are any more important than me � it's any more important for you guys to make your flights than it is for me.

And if you � and if you had � had � had said anything any earlier, that could have made this avoidable.  But you waited until after you finished your direct examination of Dr. Figlar to say anything about the fact that you had a flight and that you were not going to stick around for me to ask my questions in response.

MR. LATHAM:  I think you wasted time by going into subject matters you knew were beyond the scope.

MR. MCPHARLIN:  Well, first of all, I took �

7      reflect how long it took me to ask him about

8      a document that you refused to let him

9      answer.  So I don't see why it's � it's �

10          MR. LATHAM:  Let's stop.  How much time

11      do you legitimately have?

12          MR. MCPHARLIN:  I probably have at

13      least a half an hour's worth of questions.  I

14      mean, you just went for an hour.  I'm

15      entitled to cross-examine him.

16          MR. LATHAM:  I'm not saying you're not.

17      All I'm saying is you're � is why can't we

18      finish this if it's only a half hour another

22      Why can't we?

23          MR. MCPHARLIN:  All right.  Well, first

1      through a lot of documents, and you intend to

2      use your testimony � I'm sure you intend to

3      use it as some sort of trial deposition, so

4      I'm entitled to cross-examine him.

5          MR. LATHAM:  I didn't say you weren't

6      entitled to it.  Did � I never said that and

7      I'm not taking that position.

8           MR. MCPHARLIN:  You're leaving, so of

9      course you're saying I'm not entitled to

10      that.

11           MR. LATHAM:  No.  I'm just saying we're

12      going to have to do it at another time.  And

13      if it's that short, then it's that short.

14      And if we want to go to a Judge � and if

15      he's going to force us to fly back down here,

16      then maybe he'll do that, but I don't think

17      he will because you had seven and a half

18      hours and you're only talking about a half

19      hour more.  That's � it's not unreasonable

20      to do it by telephone.

21          MR. MCPHARLIN:  A half an hour more is a

22      conservative estimate.

Dr.Ubet dtnitd this and says thara was no sign of walling or fibrous tissua on a aacrosoopio examination at autopsy.

No control is shown for tha alteration of watar by rats not given nicotine.    This oalssion aakas it lapotsible to judga tha weening of tha llnas in Pig.l.     Ths rats wara givan aatar and nlcotins by south at saro ^      tiat and tho nicotine should have delayed its aterstlon.    fht authors say

that tha effect of niootlnt tas axartad froa 2-8 hours aftar saro.     Tho action of nlcotins, however, is observed afttr 15 aintites, and tha doss which was usad would hart finished its action by 3 hours, or at tha aost k hours.    Ths difftrance* bstvtan ths controls, tha resistant rats sad tha tolarant rats havs no significsnes in visa of ths absanoa of a control without nleotins and in view of tha delay before the alleged nicotine effect appeared. Dr. Libit was herself puisled by this result.

Possible action of aloof foe via the re^ff ofnor^riniiAnt fgWUffl ffiiPiaQ)

It Is cortainly likely that tha action of nicotine in touting an

�   antidiuretic action has nothing to do with release of noradrenaline.    Such an idea hot inter been suggested.    However, tha results in fig.3 showing tha

^-'     effect of nicotine on rats given reeerplne aartly express the result as a plot of doss against tine in which 50Jf of the euaulative saount of urine aas excreted and there are no observations showing tha tine course of tha excretion of aater alone.     It say be that there is a difference in rata of excretion cf rats given rosarplna alone, and those given nlcotins aftar reserpinej but, on this no information it available*

�            Proa ths results of this section the authors oonoluds that "nicotine /   doaa not saaa to stisolate tha hypothalaaio centre (supraoptic nucleus)

/    that synthasisas tha antidiuratio honsone".   It can be said with reasonable / |    aonfidanoa that this conclusion is wrong*   Plckford deswastrated that tha '  i   antl-dluretio effect of acetylcholine was axartad only whan an inject ion '    was aads into the supraoptic nucleus and not whan the injection waa 0*5aa outside.   Hloctine acts in tha saaa way as acetylcholine and therefore it \       should be without action when the supraoptic nuoleus it destroyed,   the destruction of the nuoleus by electrocoagulation using a stereotactic

apparatus ia a highly skilled procedure, and the aost likely conclusion ia that the authors wero unable to obtain a sufficiently precise localisation and therefore did not in fact destroy the supraoptic nucleus.   Dr. Llbet agrees with this criticise and it Is extraordinary that a scientist cm report on a series of experiments and when questioned about their validity admit that they were not properly carried out.

ACTION OF NICOTINE ON THB "STreSS" MECHANISM (Section 111.

p.12 ft ato.)

The experiments in this section involve biochemical as distinct fro* pharmacological and surgical aethods and are therefore lesa open to errors of technique.

Action of nicotine in the adrenal ascorbic acid depletion test (Section IIIA. p,]"

The figures on p. 14 (Table l) for control rets agree with figures published by others and it is likely that the effect of nicotine is to reduce the adrenal ascorbic content as they say.     The details of these experiaents are now available and it is intended to repeat these crucial observations.     Professor Buttle has aade observations on the action of nicotine on adrenal weight and so far has failed to observe an effect.    The Bat tell a workers have only found an effect on adrenal weight when nicotine was administered over prolonged periods.

Action of nicotine in the adrenal ascorbic acid depletion test after reserpine treataent (Table 2. p.15)

The observations of the diminished effect of nicotine after reserpine treataent are certainly interesting and worth further investigation, because tha depleting action of nloctine aay involve the release of adrenaline fro* the adrenal aedulla.     Adrenaline itself depletes ascorbic acid in the adrenal glands*

Action of nicotine In the adrenal ascorbic acid depletion test after aorphine treataent (Tcble 5. p.17)                ""

The evidence here does not Justify the conclusion that the depletion of ascorbic acid by nlootine after giving aorphine was leas than without aorphine (though it aay in fact be so) because there were no rats given nicotine only in the experiaents of Table J.     It is not peralssible to assume that the figures of Table 1 (p.14) are coaparable.

We are not fasUlor with the aethod used but It would appear to be a bod aethod since rats noraelly eat at night and they do not like a powdered diet.     The Battel!e rats, however, so A.K.I, wis inforoed, flourished on a powdered diet'.     Appetite was measured for only one hour within sn hour of dosing with nicotine and It is likely that sany drugs would show transient anoraxio activity under these conditions.     The dose of nicotine (2 sg./Xg.) used In these experiments (p.26)� which corresponds in son to UOag/TOkg son, Is a dose which would probably csum s rise of blood pressure and general stimulation of the ayspathotic ayatco and thia would be aoooapanied by fright. If this occurredt dialnution in ^petite would be expected.    After one hour when the test of appetite began the anioals appeared nonaal but no observations were sade ta see if this dose of nicotine did In fact stimulate the sympathetic systes of the rat or for how long such an effect lasted. It would, for exanple, have been easy to see if it caused c rise of blood sugar.    It is clear fron Pig. 7 that i-gAs nicotine completely suppresses food intake but the supposed anorexic activity of 1 A 2*g/kg, in flew of the wide scatter, la far froa convincing.

The reeulta of thla aectlon are ahown in Tablea 7*8*     In Table 7 are given flgurea for epldldyawl fat;   nicotine waa without affeot after 2 aontha but eauaed a deeraaae freo 5 aontha onvarda*     It ia difficult to judge the algnlflomnce of the effect because the control figurea roae frow 373ogAOOg at 2 aontha to 667/tOOg at 5 tenths. Certainly such result� ahould be deterained by the uae of litter-aate control..     Tha flguree in Table 8 owviouely show a eignifioant difference, but they nay be explained by the effect of nicotine in tfcrihlahing the aaount of food eaten.

The evidence that nicotine releases free fatty acids Cm) in 10 �Unite* It likely to be correct because It la known that adrenaline releases FPA in the blood, and nicotine nay exert lta action by releasing adrenaline.

the evidence that nicotine enhances the disappctranc* of FFA, the activity apparently being definite after 6 hours (Fig. 10), la intereeting.     However, Konttinen and Rejaselai (Laneot, March 30th, 1963, p.850) have found that in aan the rite of FPA after conavqptton of fat was the sane in 20 lookers as in 20 non-sooker* �* .. m� hitfr �t i hour, ttan �t I hour..   (At mn^ nunber of cigarettes snaked by the lookers In 6 hours was 23) * The final sentence on p.37 is therefore not supported by sufficient evidence*

HEFPKT WO. 1 RSL^RDTJfC IWJECT HOTO 11 This report is in effect a literature survey and we do not wish to eoaaent extensively on it.   On p. 5i line K of the aocount of the action of tranquil Users the statement is wade that reserplne inhibits the electrical activity of hypothalanic structures, particularly those of the posterior nuclei wMcb regulate the sympathetic nerves of the viscera and blood vessels.   This statement appears to be in conflict with the evidence of Iggo and Dr. Martha Vogt, FJ*.3. (Journal of Physiology, I960, Vol.150, p.U4) that there la no diminution In the lcpulua passing along the preganglionic svaptthttlc fibres in the anisal after treatment with reserplne*

The author has relied a good deal on the views of Brodis (see p.6) and it should be pointed out that Brodie has changed his views several Urn** in the last few yesra.   Indeed there are so asny theories and relatively few facts, that so it workers doubt the possibility of any dear description at the present time of the part played by the various substances present In the brain.

Effect of nicotine on brmln serotonin stores in rats (Section U1B. 3Mi. P-ffl

The observations on the effect of nicotine on the serotonin in the brain ore very incomplete, and the conclusion that nicotine "does not act in depleting serotonin stores from brain or other parts of the body" is premature* and contrary to the observations of Werle ihlch the authors theiselves quote.   It is quite certain that nicotine does not act like reserpine in this respect but it is by no aeons certain whether there is for example a transient release of serotonin or catecholamines.

FDUL COMMENTS

Of the three lain lines of investigation to which these reports have been devoted,  we have already commented that the conclusion of the Bat telle sorters that the anti-diuretic action of nicotine is still present when the supraoptic nucleus is destroyed is alaost certainly incorrect.   The cost interesting results in the reports are on the effect of nicotine on the "stress" mechanism but these by themselves are very incomplete and there is some controversy about thai.   These experiments should be repeated and supplemented In the T.3.C. Laboratories at Harrogate*   Concerning the results on the effect of nicotine on body weight regulation, it would be unwise to conclude that smoking can be used as a means of reducing weight on the evidence presented.                                       \

The inforaation of these reports is not sufficiently complete to justify any form of publication.
