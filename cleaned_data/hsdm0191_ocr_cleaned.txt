2        Q,  And in your 32 years has there been any

3   year where you did not receive a bonus?

4        A.   Yes.

5        Q.   Do you remember when that was?

6        A.   No.  I don't recall the specific years

7   other than for  for many years I wouldn't have

8   been eligible for bonuses.  It's not something that

9   was always in place during the time that I've

8
	A.   The company has the general goal of         |

9
	transforming tobacco from the standpoint of           \

10
	providing new and innovative products that have the   f

11
	potential to reduce the risks associated with

12
	i
 tobacco use.  In terms of those goals we would like   |

13
	to see over time the use of tobacco migrate from      j

14
	combustible products to noncombustible products or    \

15
	other products that have the potential to reduce      j

16
	risk.

17
	Q.   And when they give you your bonus at the    \

18
	end of the year, do they explain which goals they     j

19
	met and which ones they did not meet?

20
	A.   That's something that's reviewed, as I      \

21
	understand it, by the compensation committee of the   j

22
	board for the company; and they would put forward     \

23
	basically the scoring against the objectives.

C*  T
	Q.  Okay.  So in 2012 did R.J. Reynolds meet

25
	their internal company goal for transforming

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221pgNbr=12
Page 13

1       tobacco?

2        A.   I believe yes, that they did well in that

3   regard and that they continued to develop new and

4   innovative products,  I think generally, yes.  We

5   did not meet our goals as far as 100 percent of the

6   MAP payout.

7        Q.   What did R.J. Reynolds do in 2012 that

8   was different from every other year as far as

9   transforming tobacco?

10        A.   In terms of 2012 there was a focus on

11   quite a number of things.  In terms of Reynolds

12   American and the companies within it, those

13   companies collectively have a focus on transforming

14   tobacco.  In terms of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

15   Company, Reynolds Tobacco Company would have had a

16   focus on Camel Snus, so on a noncombustible product

18             There's also a focus within R.J. Reynolds

19   Tobacco research and development to do research

20   around electronic cigarettes and to also, through

21   service-level agreements, work with

22   nicotine-replacement therapy products.  So all of

23   these things are part of the concepts of

24   transforming tobacco and trying to reduce the risks

25   associated with tobacco use.

5
	In addition, part of transforming tobacco

6
	is a focus on reducing youth tobacco use.  So part

7
	of what Reynolds and Reynolds American companies

o
	did was to try and interface with state legislators   s

9
	to try to have increased or strengthened penalties    \

10
	for youth possession of tobacco, so that was         \

11
	another area of focus in transforming tobacco.

12
	Q.   Okay.  So in 2012 what did R.J. Reynolds    |

16
	MR. KREINER:  I would, just for the         |

18
	proprietary or business confidential information

19
	with respect to product development; but if you can

21
	A.   What Reynolds did there -- I can't recite

22
	for you all of the details of the operating plan.

23
	But they continued to emphasize trying to improve

24
	those products, to try and have those products

25  available to smokers, for example, that are

2   to use other types of tobacco.

3             So they work to continue to make the

4   highest quality products possible, to make those

5   available, and to make those available in a way

6   that smokers would consider them.

7   BY MS. CHAMBERS:

8        Q.   In 2012 what did R.J. Reynolds do

9   publicly that was different than every other year 10       that would have allowed them to meet their goals

12        A.   In terms of your question, you're asking

13   about "differently"; and part of what they did was

14   to continue to try and have that product be

15   available to smokers, to be something that smokers

16   would consider.

17             So the products available in the

18   marketplace, there are different types of Camel

19   Snus available, different varieties.  There's a

20   different packaging to it now.  But there have been zi       a numDer or ctiiirerenTi. execurionai aspects to ir.

22             That's not different from the concept of

23   recent years of having the product in the market

24   and trying to help smokers understand that it's

25   something there, if they choose to use a tobacco

	of smoking.

3
	Q.   In your answer you said they "continue to

	try," which I don't really understand how someone

5
	continues to try.  So let me ask you something        j

8
	R.J. Reynolds make it more available to consumers

10
	MR, KREINER:  I move to strike the          j

11
	prefatory comment that was not a question.  Go

12
	ahead, Doctor.

13
	A.   I'm not sure what that would mean as far    \

14
	as making it more available.  It's something that     i

15
	is available nationwide; it's something that is       [

16
	available for consumers in general.  But they         |

20
	I would say the work continues.  It's not something   |

1             MR. KREINER:  Again, with the same caveat

2   about not revealing business confidential

3   proprietary information, go ahead, Doctor.

4        A.   In terms of 2012 there would have been a

5   number of studies that had been ongoing, and so we

6   continued our efforts to bring those to successful

7   completion.  They would have been in the areas of,

9       a different tobacco product.  So, for example, a

10   smoker being switched to a noncombustible tobacco

11   product, what their behavior might be, what the

12   difference in exposure to toxicants might be, what

13   their use pattern may be, what biomarkers of effect

14   responses may be.  So this type of general

18   executed for a clinical study depending upon its

19   purpose.  But the studies generally would have been

20   around evaluating what happens if someone were to

21   switch from smoking to using a product that has the

22   potential to reduce exposure or reduce risk.

	risk of cancer if they switched; or are they         j

2
	evaluating whether it would be consumer acceptable

3
	to switch from a cigarette to a noncombustible

Ht
	tobacco product?

5
	A.   They would be more of the former, the

6
	first part of your question, than the latter in

7
	that they're not designed in any way or unto         \

8
	themselves they're not capable of being some sort     |

9
	of product assessment tool from a marketing

10
	standpoint.  They are looking at exposure to

11
	toxicants.  Some of those toxicants would be          j

12
	carcinogens.  So they would be looking to see is      j

13
	there a change in exposure to cancer-causing

14
	compounds and, in some instances, to look at          [

15
	biomarkers that are biomarkers of effect.

16
	Part of the challenge with biomarkers in    \

17
	general is to have biomarkers that are biomarkers     j

18
	of effect for specific diseases.                     f

15        Q.   But have they found that if a smoker

16   switches from regular cigarettes to Camel Snus that

17   there's an increased risk for other illnesses such

18   as mouth or tongue cancer?

19        A.  No.  Again, my understanding of the

20   epidemiology there is there's a greater risk of

21   oral cancer from smoking than from the use of

22   smokeless tobacco.

23        Q,   So from R.J. Reynolds' standpoint, if a

24   smoker of regular cigarettes were to stop smoking

25   the cigarettes and only use Camel Snus, they would

3         BY  MS.   CHAMBERS:

4                   Q.        Right?

5        A.   I believe that's true, yes, based on the

7        Q,   And does R.J. Reynolds tell the public

8   that that's their opinion?

9        A,   R.J. Reynolds is currently regulated by

10   the FDA.  And in terms of the FDA, there is a

11   section of the act, Section 911, that has the

12   legislation around communications about reduced

13   exposure or reduced risk.  So, no, Reynolds makes

14   no communications to the public about any specific

15   product and cannot do that until such time as

16   appropriate information would be put forward

17   through that process and the FDA would issue an

18   order that would allow such communication.

19        Q.   Has R.J. Reynolds applied to the FDA for

20   such a permit or whatever the term is?

21        A.   I would consider that to be proprietary

22   information in general.

23             MR. KREINER:  Based on that

24   consideration, I'll instruct him not to answer

25   absent getting a protective order.

15
	A.   My understanding is the company of course   I

	has been regulated by a number of federal agencies    j

	and state government agencies for many, many years.   [

18
	My understanding is in terms of            j

	have been regulated by the Federal Trade

2

	A.   If they were interested in that, they

11
	A.   I don't believe that the Surgeon General

1        Q.   Yes,  The Surgeon General of the

2   United States does not hold the same position that

3   R.J. Reynolds does, that noncombustible tobacco

4   products have less risk than cigarettes, right?

5             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

6        A.   No.  I don't believe I would agree with

7   that statement.  I believe that -- my understanding

8   of the Surgeon General's reports would be that

9   there's risk associated with all tobacco products.

10   I don't recall any Surgeon General's report that

11   savs that there's the same amount of risk for

12   smokeless or noncombustible tobacco products and

13   for combustible tobacco products.  I think the

14   Surgeon General reports would be well aware of the

15   epidemiology exists.

16             I think the main point that's usually put

17   forward from a Surgeon General's perspective is

18   that all tobacco products have some level of risk;

19   and I believe that is consistent with my view and

20   with R.J. Reynolds' view, as a company.

21   BY MS. CHAMBERS:

22        Q.   But the Surgeon General does not tell the

1        A.   I don't recall all of those.  From a

2   scientific perspective, I think the -- it's not a

3   legal conclusion, as best I understand it, or

4   perhaps it is.

5             But from a scientific perspective, what

6   they indicated is in terms of communications around

7   a product having the potential to reduce risk, that

8   epidemiology studies were very important to

9   reaching that conclusion.  Not that those were the

10   only studies, but that those were one type of study

11   that was important.

i z.       v.   bo tne jucige in tine Vermont case touriQ

13   that the epidemiology studies around Eclipse did

14   not show that there was an actual reduce in risk?

15        A.   No.  It was more around what types of

16   science were required for what types of

17   communication.  In terms of epidemiology for

18   Eclipse, it hadn't existed in the marketplace for a

19   sufficient period of time to conduct epidemiology.

20   So it wasn't any sort of a finding that the

21   epidemiology wasn't sufficient in terms of having

22   been conducted; it just wasn't part of the

23   scientific package that was available for the

24   product.

	In terms of the way that works is that      \

15

8        Q.   But R.J. Reynolds only sells tobacco

9   products?

10        A.   That's correct.

11        Q.   Do they operate anywhere outside of the

12   U.S.?

13        A.   No, not to my knowledge.  R.J. Reynolds

14   Tobacco Company is a domestic U.S. company.

15        Q.   And you're aware that  strike that. lb       Let me start over.

17             You're aware that jury awards or jury

18   verdicts in these Engle progeny cases would affect

19   the price or the value of Reynolds American stock,

20   right?

21        A.  No.  I'm not aware that that's a fact.

22        Q.  You said you're not aware or you are

23   aware?

24        A.   I don't know in  my understanding of

25   the stock market is that investors make choices

jwmmm^;mmmimhmhmm^^

United Reporting, Inc.

954-525-2221pgNbr=34
1   about companies.  I don't know what drives

2   investors to choose particular stocks.  I'm sure

3   that it's one factor that some investors would

4   consider.

5             But as far as any particular investor, I

6   don't know how they would value any information in

7   that regard as far as how it may or may not

8   influence them.  I think for some it may be

9   important; for some it may not.  I don't know.

10        Q.   So you don't know one way or another

11   whether jury verdicts against R.J. Reynolds would

12   reduce the value of the stock in Reynolds American?

13        A.   I believe I've just answered that

14   question.  My understanding is it's something that

15   is provided, in terms of our situation around

16   liticration, in our 10-K to all investors.

17             As far as what motivates a particular

18   investor to buy or sell stock, I can't speak for

19   each individual.  That's something that they

20   decide.  For some it may well be quite important;

21   for others, it may not be.

23   substantial jury verdicts against R.J, Reynolds is

24   one potential factor that could reduce the stock

25   price of Reynolds American, right?

	A.   No.  I mean, my understanding is that I     f

20
	come with a knowledge of facts and expert opinions.   f

21
	All of that is based on my experience.  That's what

22
	I'm here to do, is provide that information.

4
	BY MS. CHAMBERS:

5
	Q.   Yes.  You do not want Sheila Weinstein to

6
	win this case, do you?

7
	A.   Again, what I would hope is that the jury

8
	would consider all of the facts and that the jury

9
	would reach a decision.  In terms of that decision,

10
	after they've considered all the facts in the case

11
	and have been through their role as a juror and

12
	collectively as a jury, if the outcome were in

13
	favor of R.J. Reynolds, I would be pleased with

14
	that.  With that being said, it's up to the jury to

15
	hear the case and decide upon the merits of the

16
	

17
	Q.   And would you be pleased if the jury were

1 0
	to return a verdict for Sheila Weinstein?

19
	A.   Again, my view of our legal system is

20
	that's the jury's role.  I would be pleased if the

21
	jury did their role.  That being said, once they

22
	understand all of the facts of the case, I would be

23
	pleased if the outcome was for R.J. Reynolds

24
	Tobacco Company.

25       Q.   Okay.  My question was a little bit

5        R.J.   Reynolds?

6        A.   I don't know that I would look at it from

7   the standpoint of being pleased or not.  I would

8   accept that that's the verdict that the jury

9   arrived at.  I don't know that I would look at it

10   from the standpoint of being pleased or displeased.

11   It would be the outcome of that trial.

12        Q.  Okay.  But you want R.J. Reynolds to win

13   the case ultimately?

14        A.   As I've just indicated a couple of times,

15   if the trial is conducted, the jury hears all of

16   the facts and were to reach a verdict in favor of

17   Reynolds, I would be pleased.

18        Q.   Okay.  Because when I asked you if you

19   would be equally as pleased if Sheila Weinstein

20   won, you said you wouldn't put it in terms of

21        pleased.

10
	A.   I don't know that I was actually asked as   j

11
	such by anyone.  I was aware that these were going    j

12
	on and that there were individuals within the

1   category and decided which ones did inform my

2   opinion and placed those on the list as well.

3        Q.   Are there documents on here that counsel

4   for r.j. Reynolds provided to you?

5        A.   Counsel would have provided some

6   documents that I did review and make a decision as

7   to if they informed my opinions or not, yes.

8        Q,   Can you specify which ones you found

9   versus which ones you were provided by with defense

10   counsel?

11        A.   I don't know that I can do that quickly,

13             I think, for example, recently there have

14   been some articles by someone at the FDA Center for

15   Tobacco Products, a Dr. Rostron.  Those have been

16   recently added to my list.  They're ones, for

17   example, that I've identified in forming my

18   opinions and being scientific publications that I

19   wanted to add and that I would add as part of

20   forming my opinions.

21             Examples on here, for example that

22   counsel may have provided, would have been a number

24   that's provided to the Federal Trade Commission in

25   terms of tar and nicotine and carbon monoxide

1   yields of various varieties of domestic cigarettes

2   over the years.

3        Q.   Is there a reason that they provided you

4   the Federal Trade Commission reports?

5        A.   Again, I think that they have access to a

6   lot of documents in general.  And based upon areas

7   that I wanted to consider, they may have provided

8   documents.  Those are documents that I had read

9   before, and so it was more of a convenience.  I

10   read them and decided if they formed my opinions or

11   not.  But, no, they did not provide them to me and

12   say, "These are documents we think should inform

13   your opinions."  They provided them to me, I read

14   them, and I decided if they did or did not.

15        Q.   In each case that you're involved in, do

16   you go -- do you do independent research for that

17   case to go try to update yourself on whatever's out

18   there?

19        A.   I'm constantly updating myself.  I don't

20   do it from a standpoint -- on a case-by-case basis.

21   But I'm constantly, as a scientist, reading the

22   literature and informing myself.  Periodically I'll

24   my CV.  I don't have any specified times in which I

25   do that; it's more a matter of when I have the time

11

	chemistry, right?                                   j

14
	A.   Yes.  As I've provided in deposition        j

15
	testimony with your firm previously, Reynolds has     |

16
	an education program that they started in that time

17
	frame; and it's something that they've offered to     l

i 0
	their employees and it's something that I chose to    \

1        A.   It was something that I was interested

2   in.  At Virginia Tech, in fact, they were surprised

3   that I was not going to pursue a Ph.D. at that

4   point in time.  But given the fact that I was

5   sending myself through school, I wanted to go and

6   get a job.  But from the standpoint of pursuing a

7   Ph.D., it was something that I had always been

8   interested in.

9        Q.   When did you first enroll at Wake Forest

10   in the Ph.D. program? What year was that?

11        A,   That would have been I believe in 1981.

12        Q.   And how long does a Ph.D. normally take

14        A.   That would depend upon the program and

15   the student.  I don't know these days.  It probably

16   would be typically at least five years.  I think at

17   a minimum four years, and it's not uncommon for it

18   to be five, six, seven years depending upon the

19   professor, the type of research, the university.

20        Q.   When you were in school for your Ph.D.,

21   were you going full time or part time?

22        A.   When I was in school for the Ph.D., I was

23   doing that part time.  I was working full time.  I

24   was also doing that in addition.

25        Q.   Okay.  And you testified in the past that

10
	Q.
	Have they ever?                            [

11
	A.
	It's my view that Dr. John Robinson in      j

12
	the past
	would have been quite knowledgeable in       |

13
	that area.  I would have considered him an expert     \

	Is he a medical doctor?                    \

	A.
	No.

17
	Q.
	What was his degree in?                    \

18
	A.
	He had a Ph.D.  I don't know his exact

11
	Q.   Okay.  Did he have any formal training in   \

12
	neurobiological behaviors or brain disorders?

13
	A.   Again, my understanding is he had

14
	training and vast knowledge in behavioral science.    \

15
	I would have to review his CV to inform myself of

16
	all of his training, all of his credentials.  He      \

	was quite experienced.                               J

	A.   That would have been probably about two     j

2
	years to three years ago now.

3
	Q.   And as far as you know, did he ever give    \

4
	any testimony in any tobacco litigation?

5
	A.   I believe that he did.

6
	Q.   But you've never reviewed the transcripts

7
	or watched his testimony, right?                   I

8
	A.   Not that I recall, no.

9
	Q.  So currently R.J. Reynolds doesn't employ

10
	anyone that is an expert in nicotine addiction?

11
	A.  Well, I think it would depend upon how     j

12
	you define "expert."  But we have many individuals    |

13
	in the department that are - do things related to    j

14
	measurements of nicotine and so on; but I wouldn't    [

	classify them or characterize them in my opinion as   |

16
	experts in nicotine addiction, no.                 \

17
	Q.   Does R.J. Reynolds employ any medical

18
	doctors?

19
	A.   Currently, I'm not aware of anyone on       j

20
	staff having an M.D.  As far as M.D.s, all of our

21
	clinical studies would be led by an M.D.  We have     j

2
	that are M.D.s,

	Q.  You don't know their specialties?

17
	A,        I'm not sure what that would mean.  I'm     \

	also a number of individuals on staff that would be   1

2
	the leaders of our clinical studies.  Part of         

3
	what's being measured there is exposure to many       j

4
	different things in smoke including nicotine.  But

5
	that's not something that would be a typical type

6
	of job description.

7
	Q.   Is nicotine the thing in cigarettes that

8
	make cigarettes addictive?

9
	A.   Nicotine in toDdcco and in tooacco smoKe

10
	is addictive.  That being said, I think the

11
	literature is quite clear that people smoke for a

12
	variety of reasons.  For some individuals, nicotine   \

13
	may well be a very important part of smoking.  For

14
	others, toe rituals, tne taste, tne actual process    i

15
	of smoking is very important to them.  So I think     \

16
	that it's not possible to characterize things in     j

17
	that single way.                                 1

20
	A.  Again, what I was trying to communicate

21
	in my last answer is what I've read in a number of

22
	scientific articles by a range of authors.  People

23
	smoke for a wide range of reasons.  For some

24
	individuals I believe that it may well be that the

25
	most important aspects of it are not nicotine, but    \

2             So, for example, I read a study in which    |

3   part of that study was to recruit what were defined        I

4   as dependent and nondependent smokers.  And in the          f

5   case of those two groups of people, clearly they              f

6   were smoking for different reasons.  Not everyone            |

8   understanding from all that I've read.

9        Q.   Let me try that again.                                                I

10             The rituals of smoking, such as holding a

11   cigarette in your hand, the smell of smoke, the       j

12   taste of cigarettes, those are not on a biological    |

13   level things that addict a smoker, right?                             j

15        A.   Again, I would not agree with that                       |

16   characterization.                                                                                f

18        Q.   But R.J. Reynolds publicly admits that      f

19   nicotine is the component in cigarettes that causes   f

20   addiction, right?                                                                               I

1   is addictive.  That statement is not on its f^ce 

2   this is my view as a scientist -- meant to imply

3   that that's the only reason people smoke.

5   through the literature that I've read, through the

6   studies that have been conducted by a range of

9       component, and for others it may not be

10   particularly important at all relative to other

11   things.

12        Q.  You agree that some smokers smoke because

13   they are addicted to nicotine, right?

14        A.   I think that's probably so, yes.

15        Q.   And you, yourself, have never been a

16   regular cigarette smoker?

17        A.   No, I haven't.

18        Q.   So you have no personal experience with

19   nicotine addiction?

20        A.   By "personal" if you mean as a smoker,

21   no, I've not been a regular smoker.

	individual versus another in terms of how they view   j

2
	01LI \J J\ JL 11 y *

3
	Q.   Do you think any of your family members     j

4
	are addicted to cigarettes?

5
	A.   I'm sorry.  My family members?

6
	\.   x e a n 

7
	A.   My parents, for example, were smokers.

8
	And when the Surgeon General's report came out,       |

9
	they considered smoking; and they both quit

10
	smoking.                                            1

11
	My understanding from my mother is that     j

12
	it was very difficult for her to quit.  At the same

13
	time, my father went and purchased a couple cartons

14
	of cigarettes, put them in a drawer, and just         j

15
	stopped.                                            |

16
	So I think by today's definition          j

17
	something they enjoy doing, something they do for a

18
	long period of time  both would have been           j

19
	addicted.  In terms of their difficulty in

20
	quitting, it was far more difficult for one to quit

21
	than the other.

22
	Q.   You said when the Surgeon General's

23
	report came out.  Are you talking about the '64       j

24
	report?                                          j

25       A.   Yes.                                      j

1        Q.   Okay,  And it's your opinion that both of

2   them were addicted?

3        A.   By today's definition  something that

4   people tend to do for an ongoing period of time and

5   may find difficult to quit -- I would say based on

6   being difficult to quit, I would say that my mother

7   clearly would meet that definition today.  My

8   father may or may not have met that definition.

9        Q.   Do you think that the Surgeon General's

10   definition of nicotine addiction is difficult to

11   quit and they smoked for an ongoing period of time?

12        A.   I think that's the way society would

1        A.   My understanding is that today it would     f

14   of how the Surgeon General's definition of                           j

15   addiction has changed, you can't say today what the

5

10
	nicotine may be an important component of smoking,

11
	but it's all these things together.

1   yields of tar and nicotine, this was something that

2   was driven by consumer demand, by recommendations

3   fr0m the public Health community, from the Surgeon

4   General, and so on.  So those activities are all

5   because of a demand for such products.

6             In terms of the products that have been

7   evaluated or developed that had greatly reduced

9       someone chose to do research around.

10        Q.   So if it was not for the consumer demand

11   or the Public Health community telling

12   R.J. Reynolds to attempt to take nicotine out of

13   cigarettes, they would not have done so because

14   they do not consider it to be dangerous, right?

15             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

16        A.   If I understand your question  again, I

17   think I've already indicated, it's not  nicotine

18   is not a toxicant from the standpoint it is not an

19   IARC carcinogen.  It's not something associated zu       witn triG risKs or smoKing.  it s not. tnst type or

21   compound.

22             There have been those in the Public /. o       rieaitn community ano. tne government!, even tne

24   Surgeon General, that have suggested a variety of     I   q

25   things.  Some have suggested either increasing or

1   maintaining nicotine and reducing tar.  Other times

2   it's been a suggestion to reduce tar and nicotine.

4   have all been things that have been investigated.

5        Q.  But R.J. Reynolds did not take nicotine

6   out of cigarettes because they thought it was

7   anything that was harmful.  They did it just

8   because the public wanted them to?

9        A.   In terms of reducing the risks associated

10   with smoking  so, for example, the risk of

11   diseases associated with smoking -- there are other

12   compounds that have been reported to be the

13   compounds that may be associated with that.

14             So, for example, for the risk of cancer,

15   there are compounds that are carcinogens that have

16   been shown to be cancer-causing.  Those are the

17   types of compounds that have been focused upon in

18   terms of trying to produce products that would

19   reduce those yields, reduce exposure to

20   cancer-causing compounds.

21        Q.   Does R.J. Reynolds believe the only risk

22   in smoking cigarettes is that there are

23   carcinogenic materials or components in a

24   cigarette?

25        A.   Again, I think R.J. Reynolds has made its

1
	views very clear in terms of our guiding principles   l

2
	and beliefs.  R.J. Reynolds believes that cigarette

3
	smoking causes serious smoking-related diseases in    \

4
	some individuals; and that in terms of the science

5
	around what drives that risk, it's quite complex.

6
	But R.J. Reynolds has been committed for decades to   !

7
	try to study that complex problem, try to identify

8
	solutions that can be implemented to reduce           1
 I

9
	exposure and reduce risk.                             \

10
	Q.   But part of the risk in smoking is that a   j

11
	person will become addicted to cigarettes, right?

12
	A.   In terms of the risk, the risk is in        \

13
	exposure to toxicants.

14
	Q.   And if a person is not addicted to          |

15
	cigarettes, they wouldn't smoke the cigarettes

16
	which contain carcinogens, right?                   \

17
	A.   I would not agree with that.  I think       \

18
	some people that smoke are not addicted to           \

19
	cigarette smoke -- cigarette smoking or nicotine.

20
	They choose to smoke, and they would be exposed to    \

21
	toxicants.

22
	Q.  But the people that are addicted  which

23
	you've already said some people smoke because they    j

 are addicted.  The people that are addicted to

1   there was no nicotine in them; and they would not

2   be exposed to the carcinogens in cigarettes, right?

3             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

4        A.   I think that some individuals that smoke

5   may be, by today's definition, addicted.  But that

6   being said, they may smoke for reasons other than

7   that, whatever they find important about smoking.

8             So they smoke for a wide range of

9   reasons.  In terms of the risks, as I've answered

10   now several times, that comes from exposure to

11   toxicants.

10         ov M^  PHAMRFR^-

13        Q.   Does R.J. Reynolds believe that there are

14   consumers who smoke only because they are addicted?

15        A.   I don't know that R.J. Reynolds holds a

16   view in that regard.  Reynolds' guiding principle

17   and belief is that nicotine is in tobacco and it's

18   in cigarette smoke and that nicotine is addictive.

19        Q.   Okay.  Do you hold the opinion that there

20   are some people who smoke cigarettes only because

21   they are addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes?

22        A.   My view is that for some individuals,

23   nicotine may be very important; for some, even the

24   most important aspect of smoking.  I doubt for

25   anyone that it's the only aspect of smoking that

I      CD l\3

954-525-2221pgNbr=75
Page 76 I

1   they find important to them as far as why they

2   smoke.

3             If, as your question would suggest,

4   everything is all about nicotine, there are

5   cigarettes that have had similar amounts of

6   nicotine to other cigarettes on the market that

7   have not been successful at all.  And those

8   cigarettes, by what I think you're putting forward

10             So it's my view that it's not all about

11   nicotine  it s aoout a range or oenaviors, a range

12   of things that people enjoy about smoking.  That

13   being said, for some individuals, I think nicotine

14   is important; and for some, it may well be the most

15   important aspect of smoking.

16        Q.   Okay.  Taking out an important factor or

17   the most important factor, do you believe there are

18   people who want to quit who hate the taste, hate

19   the smell, they don't like their fingers having

20   nicotine stains on them but they cannot stop

21   smoking because they are addicted to the nicotine

22   in cigarettes?

23             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  Go

24   ahead.

25        A.   I think that smoking  it's been known

10   they can be successful.  For some individuals, the

23             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

24   Asked and answered.

25        A.   I believe I did answer that.  I'm not

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221pgNbr=77
Page 78

X       sure what you mean.

2             My view of addiction is that it's defined

3   as something that someone does on an ongoing basis

4   and may find it difficult to quit.

5             If your question was meant to ask, is the

6   only reason they smoke nicotine; my answer is no.

7        Q.   Okay.  So to be clear, you do not believe

8   that there are individuals who smoke only because

9   they're addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes?

10        A.   That would not be my view, no.  I think,

11   as I've said now several times, for some

13   of smoking, but I don't believe that that would be

14   the only reason that they would smoke.

15        Q.  Okay.  Does R.J. Reynolds want people to

16   quit smoking?

17        A   R J Revnolds wants anv smoker that's

18   concerned about the risks of smoking or for any

19   other reason, anyone that wants to quit to quit,

20   yes.

21        Q.   And what does Reynolds do to help those

22   who want to quit and have difficulty quitting?

23        A.   R.J. Reynolds, first of all, makes those

1                            R.J. Reynolds, as part of transforming

and has introduced products that are tobacco

4   products for those that want to stop smoking but

5   want to continue using tobacco products.  In terms

6   of those products, they would have less risk

7   associated with them.

8             That being said, Reynolds has also

9   through service-level agreements worked with a

10   company called Niconovum to try and introduce --

11   actually introduce nicotine-replacement therapy

12   products, and those are products intended to help

13   smokers quit smoking.

14        Q.   What type of products is R.J. Reynolds

15   currently putting out on the market to help smokers

16   quit smoking cigarettes?

17        A.   I believe I just answered that question.

18   My answer would be the same.

19        Q.   You said "products," so I'm asking

20   specifically what products they're putting out,

21   besides the Camel Snus, if that's what you're

22   talking about.

23        A.   Now I understand your question more

24   precisely.  You're asking for the names of the

25   individual products, as far as the brand names.

	So they would include products such as      \

2
	Camel Snus; they would include Zonnic, which is a

3
	nicotine-replacement therapy product.  That's

4

	Is there any other product that

10

13
	A.
	Again, I'm not sure exactly what you mean   \

14
	when you
	say "help them stop smoking"; but these

1 c
	are products other than cigarettes, so they fall
	
16
	into two
	categories.  One would be tobacco products

17
	rnan. are
	not combustible products; the other would

18
	be, as I
	indicated, a nicotine-replacement therapy    \

	product,
	the Zonnic gum.

	It's a dissolvable tobacco product.

21
	Q.
	Is it something that they put in their

22

	I

23
	A.
	Yes.  All of these would be oral tobacco    !

24

 They're something that's put in the        \


	mouth, and they dissolve and are consumed.            j

1        Q.  What's the difference between all three

2   of these products?

3        A.   The difference between them is their

4   form, their shape.  In terms of -- my understanding

5   is in terms of interacting with smokers and trying

6   to understand from them what types of products they

7   might want to consider, they provided these

8   products.  In fact, they suggested the names for

9   the products.  So these are products that smokers 10       indicated they'd be interested in.  In simple

*|i            f-ciV'iTie  x.Vh^ c|- I pi/  oj_^._^  r^nd j" h p Orb differ in

12   their shape; and they would differ in the amount of

13   time that someone might use them.

15   does it relate in any of these products versus a

16   cigarette?

17        A.   That's a complex question potentially.

18   It depends on what you mean by "relate."

19             They would generally  since they have a

20   much smaller amount of tobacco, they would have far

21   less tobacco in them than a cigarette would have.

22   So they would have less tobacco, they would have

23   less nicotine in terms of the product.

24        Q.   In terms of how much the smoker gets upon

25   using this product, has R.J. Reynolds done any, you

United Reporting, Inc.

954-525-2221pgNbr=86
Page 87

1   know, clinical tests or anything to determine the

2   amount that the smoker is actually receiving?

3        A.   Yes.  We have evaluated these products in

4   studies.  And in terms of the amount of exposure,

5   it would be generally reduced compared to cigarette

6   smoking.  It would depend on how many of the

7   products they would choose to use; but generally

8   they would have anywhere from slightly to

9   moderately reduced amounts to very significantly

10   reduced amounts of exposure to nicotine.

11        Q.   And these products, the Sticks, Strips,

12   and Orbs, are they available, you know, without a

13   prescription?

17        Q.   Does R.J. Reynolds have the ability to

18   control the amount of nicotine that's in a

19   cigarette?

20        A.   In terms of the amount of nicotine that's

21   in a cigarette, it generally is going to be related

22   to the amount of tobacco that's in the cigarette.

23   So different cigarettes would have different

24   amounts of tobacco; they would also have different

25   amounts of nicotine.  If that's what you mean, then

United Reporting, Inc.

954-525-2221pgNbr=87
Page 88

1   the answer would be yes.

2        Q.   And R.J. Reynolds has the ability to take

3   nicotine out of cigarettes?

4        A.   R.J. Reynolds has various designs that

5   have reduced the yields of tar and nicotine, yes. d       v   AnQ rney ve nact mar, capaoiiiry since

7   1980, right?

8        A.   Generally, I would say that's correct,

11   lowest yielding products, ones that had values that

12   were not measurable by the standard test method,

13   those products would have been available in that

14   general time frame.

15             Prior to that there would have been other

16   technologies that also would have also reduced the

17   yields of tar and nicotine.

18        Q,   And are you talking about the low-tar

19   light cigarettes?

20        A.   I'm talking about various technologies

21   such as filters, such as reconstituted tobacco,

22   such as expanded tobacco, such as the porosity of

23   the cigarette paper, filter ventilation.  All of

24   these various cigarette design technologies.

25        Q.   So is it your position that filters on

6

	A.   That would not be a correct statement.

	should be provided in appropriate venues or in an     j

9
	appropriate forum.  So scientific information        l

10
	should be provided in scientific ~ at scientific

23
	I may want to learn may be scientific in nature, it

	may be functional in nature; but I would go and

1   about a particular product.  And I would consider a

3   interested in, and they could include various

4   sources of information.

5   BY MS. CHAMBERS:

6        Q.   So you don't agree with  strike that.

7             Is it the responsibility of the company

8   making a product to make sure that its consumers

9   are fully informed of the health effects of their

10   products?

11             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

12        A.   I'm not sure that I can answer that other

13   than generally I think that information should be

14   provided and that there should be communication in

15   an appropriate venue depending upon the type of

16   information, yes.

17   BY MS. CHAMBERS:

	relayed in a scientific forum, right?                 j

2
	A.   Yes, in terms of studies.  For example, I   f

3
	don't know but I would suspect you've seen science    f

4
	in the newspaper.  That's not a report of science;    1

5
	it's a news report about science.  The actual

6
	science would be reported at a scientific meeting

7
	or in a scientific journal, it would have details

8
	about the methodology that was employed, about the    j

9
	statistical analysis of the data and so on.           [

10
	It's my expectation that many consumers

11
	would not be interested in that level of

12
	information, but they may be interested in a higher   \

13
	level of information.  So they may choose to get      \

14
	that information on the Internet or from a           \

15
	newspaper, or whatever source, as opposed to going    j

16
	lo a scienuiiic meeting.                            .

17
	Q.   Right.  And the reason why the American

18
	public or a layperson who doesn't have a degree in    |

19
	chemistry or biology, the reason why they should      |

20
	seek information from a newspaper as opposed to a    j

21
	scientific journal is because they wouldn't          |

22
	understand what it's saying anyway in a scientific    \

23
	journal, right?                                  \

24
	A.   I don't believe that I would agree with

25  that statement, no,  I think that today people,       j

1   depending upon their interest and depending upon

2   what they want to know, access a wide range of

3   information.  And sometimes it can be quite

4   detailed science, if that's their choice, even

5   without going to a scientific meeting; other times

6   they may not be interested in that level of detail.

7             So, no, if you're trying to suggest that

8   there's a uniform standard and that everyone out in

9   the general public is either aware or not aware or

10   interested or not interested or only wants one type

11   of thing, much like any kind of behavior, there's a

12   wide range of behaviors within the population that

13   is our society.

14        Q.   Do you believe that anybody can just go

_L U                0.11 \JL      LA 11 \JL w L D L CI i 1 \JL      W X1 CI L*-      JL L-       O       O C* V JL X X vJ   

17        A.   Again, it would depend upon the

18   individual.  I think that people are exposed to

19   tremendous amounts of information and they have it

20   today, especially, more readily available to them

21   than ever before; and that people tend to look at

22   all kinds of things depending upon their interest.

23   I would not presume to suggest that any individual



24   could not pursue learning about something if they     I  gj

25        want  to.

	R.J. Reynolds first became a company?

10   cigarette smoking is addictive, I think that at

4   at that time that cigarette smoking could be

10   BY MS. CHAMBERS:

11        Q.   Did R.J. Reynolds ever tell the public

12   that cigarette smoking was difficult to quit before

13   1964 when the Surgeon General came out and told the

14   public that it can be difficult to quit?

15        A.   If by telling the public you mean were

16   there statements made publicly, I believe that

17   there may well have been.  I don't know

18   specifically.

19        Q.   Can you tell me the forum that would have

20   been used by R.J. Reynolds to tell the public that

21   it can be difficult to quit smoking?

22        A.   Again, one example may have been even --

6   1964?

7        A.   I don't right off, no.

8        Q.   Would you dispute that they were only

9   involved in congressional hearings after 1964?

10        A.   Again, as I just indicated, I don't know

11   when they first were, so I have no basis to affirm

12   or dispute.  I don't know when they were first

13   involved in such a hearing.

17   hearings and providing testimony in congressional

18   hearings?

19        A.   I think I was generally aware of how

z,u       smoKing was perceiveo. in our society, or tne tact

21   that there had been Surgeon General's reports.  I'd

22   read about that in Reader's Digest as a child.  I

23   was aware that there were warnings on cigarette

24   packs.  I think I was aware that there was

25   government interaction with tobacco products.

7
	A.   None come to mind as I sit here, no.

8
	Q.   In fact, R.J. Reynolds actually disputed

9
	that statement and said that more research was

10
	necessary to determine whether cigarettes can be

11
	habituating, right?

12
	A.   It's not my understanding that Reynolds     j

13
	was of the view that there was more research to

14
	determine if they could be habituating or not.  I

15
	don't know that that's true, no.                   |

16
	Q.   Do you know if Reynolds told the American   j

17
	public after the 1964 Surgeon General's report that

18
	cigarettes are not habituating?                    j

19
	A,   Well, after 1964, as we sit here today,     J

20
	our website would sav that nicotine in ciaarette

21
	smoke and in tobacco is addictive.                   j

23
	until 1999, right?                                 j

24
	A,   In that time frame, yes.

25       Q.   So from 1964 to 1999, R.J. Reynolds told    |
	
United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221pgNbr=103
Page 104

1   the public that their cigarettes were not

2   addictive, right?

4   an accurate characterization, no.

5        Q.  But you already agreed before 1999

6   R.J. Reynolds never told the public that cigarettes

7   can be addictive, right?

8        A.   It's my understanding that Reynolds held

9   the view in 1964, for example  Reynolds

11   something that could be habituating; and that

12   subsequent to that time there were scientists at

13   Reynolds that published scientific articles in that

14   regard, and those are on the record.

15             As far as what Reynolds told the public,

16   I don't know that there were specific statements

17   about that.  I think that the public was being

18   well-informed.  That's my personal view; I believe

19   that was the situation.  Today our website is quite

20   clear on our guiding principle and belief.

21        Q.   Do you believe that in 1964 the public

22   was well-informed about the addictive nature of

23   cigarettes?

24        A.   Again, Counselor, no disrespect; but

25   those aren't the words that I used.

1                   Q.        I'm  asking  you.

2        A.   I said I think at that point in time it

3   was well-known that cigarette smoking could be

4   difficult to quit.

5        Q.   When do you believe that the public

6   became well-informed that cigarettes could be

7   addictive?

8        A.   In terms of cigarette smoking being

9   addictive, the definition of "addiction" changed;

10   and it changed around the time of the 1988 Surgeon

11   General's report.  So I think there was a

12   tremendous amount of press probably at that time

14   based on that change in definition, it was declared

15   that the Surgeon General has determined that by

16   that definition.

17             I don't know that the press at that time,

18   that all of the general communications went into

19   the fact that the definition had changed or not;

20   but I think that there was a tremendous amount of A1       information aoout wnat tne burgeon oeneral was

22   saying when the report came out.

23        Q.   And you were working at R.J. Reynolds at

24   the time the 1988 Surgeon General's report came

25   out, right?

1
	A.   Yes, I was.

2
	Q.   Did you have any conversations with        |

3
	anyone at R.J. Reynolds about this 1988 Surgeon

4
	General's report?

5
	A.   I don't believe I had anything specific

6
	as far as the report.  I think there were probably

7
	conversations that the report had come out and so

8
	on.

9
	Q.   And you would agree that from 1988 until

10
	1999 R.J. Reynolds publicly disagreed with the        \

11
	Surgeon General that cigarettes could be addictive?   [

12
	A.   Reynolds agreed with the Surgeon            j

13
	General's views in 1964.  What Reynolds disagreed     \

14
	with, at least the scientists at Reynolds that were   \

15
	knowledgeable and working in that area, was that

16
	nothing had changed other than a definition.  So      \

17
	their views  and they've published in that          |

18
	regard -- I think are available and quite clear.

19
	So it wasn't so much a disagreement with

20
	the Surgeon General, per se, as an acknowledgement    j

21
	that what had changed was a definition.

22
	Q.   But from 1988 until 1999 R.J. Reynolds

23
	told the public that they do not agree with the       j

24
	Surgeon General's definition of "addiction," right?   j

7        Q.   When did R.J. Reynolds first publicly

8   acknowledge that cigarettes cause COPD?

9        A.   I don't know the specific date.  But,

10   again, at least by the time frame of around 2000,

11   in terms of putting our views on our website, it

12   would have been part of that.

13             Clearly, in terms of COPD, part of the

14   warning labels that would have been in advertising d       ana on cigarettes oegmning in i^oo wouia nave

16   indicated that cigarette smoking causes emphysema.

17   So I think that those would be examples of when

18   that type of information was communicated.

19        Q.   And R.J. Reynolds did not voluntarily put

21   cigarettes could cause emphysema, right?

22        A.   The warning labels were mandated by

23   Congress, and Reynolds fully complied.

	A.   In terms of your question, it's phrased     [

2
	to say "could cause,"  It's my personal view that     1

3
	in terms of doing research around the risks of

4
	smoking, that Reynolds for many decades was focused

0
	on trying to understand what compounds may be        j

	the possibility.  I think that Reynolds has

10
	acknowledged through its actions that that           \

11
	possibility existed for many decades.  So I think

12
	that's been an ongoing activity, as far as the

13
	possibility.

14

	acknowledged it was a possibility?                  j

16
	A.   By having a research department that was    j

17
	trying to understand what actually drove that risk    |

18
	and by trying to reduce it.                           j

	Q.   And how -- when did they first initiate     !

22
	Q.   So in the 1950s R.J. Reynolds              [

23

1   again, as far as COPD, the warning labels would

2   have been on advertising and packs.  I think that

3   there would have been science evolving.  I don't

4   know at what point in time.  In fact, I doubt for

5   the various scientists there was a single uniform

6   day where their views may have been formed, in

7   terms of it causing that disease.  But at least by

8   the year 2000, I think it would have been in our

9   website communications.

10        Q.   You're not aware of any public statement

11   by R.J. Reynolds prior to 1999 telling the public

13        A.   I don't believe that any of the

14   statements would have suggested there wasn't a risk

15   for that.  As far as by "causing," I think in terms

16   of understanding mechanisms and so on, it probably

17   was not communicated in that way at that time.

18        Q,   Well, it wasn't communicated to the

19   public in any way, right?

20        A.   It's not my view that Reynolds ever zi       suggesneQ unere wasn l a risK, as iar as a

22   statistical association,  I think in terms of 

23   you used the word "cause," and scientists at that

24   time felt mechanisms were important.  The Surgeon

25   General's report in 2010 begins to focus on those

United Reporting, Inc.

1   mechanisms.

2        Q.   And you're aware that R.J. Reynolds told

3   the public that more research was necessary to

4   determine whether cigarettes caused COPD before

5   1999, right?

6             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

7        A.   Again, my understanding is the risks were

8   acknowledged.  As far as causation, which is about

9   the mechanism of the disease, there was more

10   research that was needed to understand the

11   mechanism.  In fact, the 2010 Surgeon General's

12   report is still calling for more work around

13   mechanisms.

14   BY MS. CHAMBERS:

15        Q.   Can you point to any statement where

16   R.J. Reynolds told the public before 1999 that

17   there was a risk that cigarettes caused COPD?

18        A.   None come immediately to mind as I sit

19   here, no.

20        Q.   Isn't it true that prior to 1999,

21   R.J. Reynolds took the public position that there

22   was not enough information to conclude that

23   cigarettes caused lung cancer?

5   views in a straightforward way.  From a science d       standpoint., nnere is always iniQrman.ion oeing

7   gathered; and today what we understand, for

8   example, about the mechanism may well change as

9   more scientific information becomes available.

10             So when you use "truth," I take that to

11   be some sort of an absolute.  I think that based

12   upon the science of today and the company's

13   understanding, they've put forward their views in a

15   that they've changed.

16        Q.   And you've never seen any documents that

17   would indicate that R.J. Reynolds misled the public

18   about the knowledge of cigarettes causing lung

19   cancer, COPD, emphysema, and strokes?

	What I can tell you as a scientist and

2   It's been asked and answered.

3        A.   Again, I believe I've answered that.

4             The company has put forward information

5   and views that have changed over time in a

6   straightforward way.  I would expect that he would

7   consider it for what it is.

8             In terms of reaching a decision or making

9   a choice or doing whatever, he would consider

10   whatever information he deems important in that

11   regard.  It may be that; it may be more.

12        Q.   Is there any reason at any point in time

13   why Mr. Weinstein should not have believed

14   R.J. Reynolds and the statements they were making

15   to the public about smoking and health?

16             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

17        A.   Again, I think I've answered this

18   question in that he should consider that the

19   company was putting forward the information in a

20   straightforward way.  What he chooses to do with

21   that information is up to him.  I wouldn't presume

22   to suggest that I would know what he should or

23   shouldn't do for himself.  But he should rely upon

24   it as what it is, information being put forward in

25   a straightforward manner.

2        Q.   I don't understand what you mean.  You

3   keep saying "he should take it for what it is."

4   What does that mean?

5        A.   What that means, in my experience, again,

6   as I indicated in an earlier answer, if I'm trying

7   to gather information about something I consider

8   many different sources depending upon what question

10   how I put all that information together, how I

11   value that information, what it all means.

12             I take your questions to mean that I

13   should somehow make a judgment about what he should

14   believe or think, and that really is not something

15   I can do for a different individual.  I think that

16   as far as the information itself, the facts are

	Q.   I'm asking you, yeah.  You specifically

8
	when you do your own research to determine

9
	something is healthy to use or safe to use, there

10
	is no reason to believe that the company making the

	product would have the best and most information

	words in your questions referring to my answers       \

16
	that aren't the words that I've been using.  I said

2   consistency of information, when I'm seeing the

4   different sources.  I mean, there are a variety of

5   things to evaluating information.

6             But as far as the way that you've

7   characterized approaching it, to assume that

8   something is absolute or that in all cases a

9   company that produces a product has the most

10   information about it, I wouldn't agree with that.

11   In some instances, that may be true.  There may be

12   companies that are the most knowledgeable about

13   their product.  In other cases the product may be

14   extensively studied, and there's far more knowledge

15   publicly available than just what the company has

16   looked into.

17        Q.   As far as R.J. Reynolds, would Reynolds

18   have the most information about its products?

19        A.   It would depend on the product and the

20   question that you're trying to address.  In terms

1   bodies; and that's been available for many, many

2   decades.

3             So as far as being able to say who has

4   the most, I'd first of all have to have a metric on

6   proportion of that sum total the company had.

7             What I can tell you is the company's been

8   actively enqaged in understanding the composition

9   of tobacco, the composition of tobacco smoke, and

10   trying to identify the compounds that may be

11   associated with the risks of smoking for many, many

13             So, for example, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

14   Company, scientists there, have probably identified

15   more compounds in tobacco and tobacco smoke than

16   &ny other single scientific entity.  But that being

17   said, there are many other entities that have

18   contributed significantly to that knowledge.

19        Q.   You have no reason to doubt that if

20   something is put out into the public by another

21   source that R.J. Reynolds would not have that same

22   information, right?

23        A.  You're saying is  I take your question

24   to mean that Reynolds is fully aware of all

25   publicly available information.

12   not know about its products at any point in time,

13   right?

14        A.   I'm sorry.  Can you ask that question

15   again?

16        Q.   Yeah,  You have no reason to believe that

17   Mr. Weinstein knew something about R.J. Reynolds

18   cigarettes at any point in time that R.J. Reynolds

19   did not know, right?

20        A.   What I -- what I know about Mr. Weinstein

21   is in the various documents that we've designated

9   researching a product you look for consistency.

10   And if something is inconsistent, if there are two

11   inconsistent views in the public about something,

12   it would not be unreasonable for a consumer to side

13   with the statements that are made by the

16        A.   I take your questions to be asking me

17   about judgments and value judgments and judgments

18   about evaluating information.  I can tell you how I

19   va]_ue things or judge things in general; but as far

20   as specifically, it will depend upon the question

21   I'm trying to answer, the product I'm trying to

22   understand, the circumstance in our society I'm

23   trying to understand.

24             How I evaluate information, how I seek Za d       out in i or mat i on, now l value tnat miormation to

1   reach a judgment is something entirely personal to          j

2   me.  I can't speak to Mr. Weinstein in terms of how        f

3   he would approach it.                                                                        f

4   BY MS. CHAMBERS:

5        Q.   Let me back up.  You agree that at                       |

6   certain points in time the information that                         f

7   R.J. Reynolds put out to the public was                                 f

8   inconsistent with what the statements by the health        |

9   community were putting out to the public regarding          f

10   the health effects of smoking, right?                                      f

11             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.        j

12        A.   Again, I'm not sure which specific ones     |

13   you're referring to, but Reynolds has put forward            I

14   its views.  At times, and depending upon the                       |

15   particular scientific area, they may well have been

16   the same or they may have been different.  Is there        j

17   a specific example?                                                                           I

18   BY MS. CHAMBERS:                                                                                  j

19        Q.   Yeah.  If R.J. Reynolds put out a

20   statement that more research was necessary to        j

j:

21   determine whether cigarettes cause health problems,   I

22   like emphysema or strokes or lung cancer, it would

23   not be unreasonable for Mr. Weinstein to agree with   f

I w

24   that, right?                                                                                                    o>

SECOND AMENDED SEVERED COMPLAINT

Plaintiff SHEILA WEINSTEIN, as personal representative of the ESTATE OF IRWIN WEINSTEIN, sues DEFENDANTS and alleges as follows:

|NTROptj(:T10N ANp GRNERAL ALLEGATIONS

1. Plaintiff is a member of the class of persons described by the Supreme Court of Florida in Engle v. Liggett Group, Inc., 945 So.2d 1246 (Fla. 2006) {"Engle"). That class is described as "[a]ll Florida citizens and residents, and their survivors, who have suffered,

pgNbr=148
presently suffer or who have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine." Id at 1256. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Engle.

2,         This action is timely because this Second Amended Severed Complaint relates back, for all purposes permitted under Florida law, to the initial Complaint which was filed within one (1) year of the Florida Supreme Court's mandate in Engle. This action was formerly part of a multi-plaintiff action, Skeila Weimtein et. al v. R.J. Reynolds et al, case number 50-2007-CA-023835-XXXX MB AA, Pursuant to an agreement between the parties, the initial action was voluntarily severed and the Plaintiff, Mrs. Sheila Weirtstein, as personal representative of the estate of Irwin Weinstcin, now files this Second Amended Severed Complaint.

3,         Plaintiff Sheila Weinstein's Decedent died on June 25, 2005. Plaintiff Sheila Weinstcin is or will be the Personal Representative of the Estate of Irwin Wcinstein. Letters of Administration will be forthcoming and filed with the Clerk of this Court. This action is brought on behalf of the Decedent's survivors and Estate. The potential beneficiaries of a recovery by Plaintiff in this action and the relationship to the Decedent arc as follows:

Potential Beneficiary___________________________________Rejationship,

Sheila Wemsteirj                                                                      Spouse

Jeffrey Wcinstein                                                                     Son

Andrew Weinstcin                                                                    Son

4,         The Decedent herein, Irwin Wcinstein, is referred to as the "Decedent or the "Smoker." Decedent was a Florida resident from 1989 until his death. Decedent's death certificate also establishes that Decedent, Irwin Weinstcin, was a Florida resident at all times relevant

2pgNbr=149
5.         Defendant Philip Morris-USA Inc. ("Philip Morris U.S.A.") is a Virginia corporation that conducts business b the State of Florida, including Palm Beach County, and did so during all times relevant to this action

6.         Defendant Lorillard Tobacco Company (which assumed the assets and liabilities of Lorillard, Inc.) is a Delaware corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Palm Beach County, and did so during all times relevant to this action.

7.         Defendant RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company, individually and as successor by merger to Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, individually and as successor by merger to The American Tobacco Company, is a North Carolina corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Palm Beach County, and did so during all times to this action.

8.         Defendant Liggett Group, LLC ("Liggett") is a Delaware limited liability company that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Palm Beach County, and did so during all times relevant to this action. Liggett is a "citizen" of Florida for purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1331 because one or more of the members of Liggett is a "citizen1* of Florida.

9.            Defendant Liggett Group, LLC (f/k/a Liggett Group, Inc., f/k/a Brooke Group, Ltd., Inc., f/k/a Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company) ("Liggett") is a Delaware limited liability company that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Palm Beach County, and It did so during all times relevant to this action. Upon information and belief* one of its members is a Florida citizen making Liggett a Florida citizen for purposes of jurisdiction.

10.          Defendant Vector Group Ltd. Inc. (r7k/a Brooke Group, Ltd., Inc.) ("Vector") is a Delaware corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida and has its principal place of business in Miami, Dade County, Florida, making it a Florida citizen.

3pgNbr=150
11.          Liggett, Brooke Group, Ltd., Inc., ("BGL") and Brooke Group Holding, Inc., ("BGH") were defendants in the Engle class action. The class was estimated lo include several hundred thousand class members seeking damages against Defendants, including Liggett and BGL. On July 7,1999, after a lengthy jury trial in what is known as "Phase I" of the case, the jury found Liggett and BGL liable to the class, exposing them to substantial judgments for compensatory and punitive damages.

12.          In September and October 1999, Defendants Liggett and BGL undertook a sham reorganization of BGL that involved the creation of several new holding companies, multiple mergers* acquisitions, and the shuffling of BGL's assets, including Liggett, in an attempt to mislead or defraud creditors, including Engle class members and the Plaintiff herein, and/or to improperly divert revenues and assets of Liggett and BGL. This sham reorganiyation established Vector as the parent of BGH and Liggett (n/k/a Liggett Group, LLC).

13.          These transactions were the product of an actual intent on the part of these Defendants to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, in violation of Florida's Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Ad

14.          In addition to the reorganization and transfer of assets described above, the management, officers, directors, personnel, location of operation, assets, liabilities, business operations, and stockholders of BGL remained the same when the name was changed to Vector; nominal consideration was involved in the reorganization; the vast majority of Liggett's revenues continue to be diverted to Vector to fund Vector's cigarette operations; and Bennett S. LeBow, through Vector, continued after the reorganization to exercise unilateral control over the assets of BGL and BGH (including the asset Liggett), as he had with the predecessor entities.

4pgNbr=151
15.          Vector therefore is the successor to the original cigarette manufacturer, Liggett, which changed its name to Brooke Group Ltd., Inc. ("BGL"). Vector is a successor to BGL as a mere continuation of BGL and Liggett. Vector is a successor to BGL by way of de facto merger with BGL. Vector also is a successor to BGH.

16.          Vector is but Engle Defendant BGL (f/k/a Liggett Group, Inc., tfk/a Liggett & Myers, Inc. f/k/a Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co.) by another name.

17.          Vector exercises such control over Liggett that Liggett is a mere instrumentality and/or alter ego of Vector. Assets and profits of Liggett have been, and continue to be, improperly diverted from Liggett and BGL in an effort to mislead or defraud creditors, and/or hide assets of Liggett and BGL, from creditors, including Plaintiff herein, and for other impruper purposes.

18.          Vector exercises such control over Liggett that Liggett is the agent of Vector and manifests no separate corporate interests of its own. Vector acknowledges Liggett as its agent for purposes including, but not limited to, the sale, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. Liggett has accepted by act or word to be the agent of Vector and acquiesced in the control exercised over it by Vector. Vector further exercises control over Liggett through the formation of Liggett Vector Brands, Inc., a company controlled by Vector, which now has taken over the sales and marketing of both Vector Tobacco, Inc., and Liggett.

19.          Joinder of Vector as a party defendant is not "fraudulent", within the meaning of decisions interpreting 28 U.S.C.  1441. In remanding a substantially identical action to state court after it was removed to the United States District Court, Judge James Lawrence King held, "Plaintiffs have laid out a reasonable argument that Vector is a liable successor.,. . Plaintiffs have established a possibility that Vector controls [Defendant] Liggett and is liable as Liggett's

pgNbr=152
alter ego___It is possible that a state court will find a cause of action against Vector" Miller,

etal v. RJ. Reynolds* eta!., 07-212274 (S.D. Fla. Aug 17,2007). Other judges throughout the Southern District of Florida agree with this conclusion. See Brawn v. RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No, 07-60432-CIV-M1DDLBBROOKS (S.D. Fla, Aug. 22,2007); Ahnso v RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-22252-CIV-K1NG (S.D. Fla. Sep 11,2007); Ross v. RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co,, No. 07-22251-CIV-KING (S.D, Fla. Sep. 11, 2007); Davis v. RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-22308-CIV-MORENO(S.D. Fla. Sep. 25, 2007); Caprio v. RJ Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-20712-CIV-JORDAN (S.D. Fla, Sep. 28,2007); Ellis v. RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-21503-CJV HIGHSMrrH (S.D. Fla. Oct 2,2007). Accordingly, no basis for the removal of this action to the United States District Court exists because the United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action.

20.       The Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A., Inc. (the "Council") and the Tobacco Institute, Inc. (the "Institute"), at all times relevant to this action, were involved in promotion, lobbying, medical research, legislative and political activities or related ventures throughout Florida and the United States both in connection with and on behalf of the Defendants.

21.          The Decedent purchased, smoked, and was addicted to cigarette products containing nicotine which were the subject of Engle. The cigarette products containing nicotine were designed, manufactured, advertised, and marketed by Defendants at all material times.

22.       At all times relevant to this action, all Defendants manufactured and distributed tobacco products containing nicotine throughout Florida and the United States. The Defendants, including Vector, were and remain Engle defendants.

23.       At all times relevant to this action, the Smoker was a Florida resident and citizen (1) who was addicted lo, purchased, and smoked cigarettes containing nicoline that werepgNbr=153
designed, manufactured, advertised and marketed by all of the Defendants and (2) who did so in sufficient quantities and for a sufficient time period to cause injury in the form of diseases and medical conditions described herein, which was caused by his addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine, and which manifested during the class period, specifically including, but not limited to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cerebral vascular disease. Additionally, the decedent died as a result of to disease or diseases.

24.       Dccedent,s medical records indicate that he was diagnosed with COPD on or about July 26, 1990. The death certificate indicates that chronic airway obstruction was the immediate cause of Decedent's death. The death certificate further indicates that Decedent, Irwin Weinstein, died in Florida on June 25,1995.

25.        Upon information and belief the smoking decedent, smoked several different brands of cigarettes and most likely smoked cigarettes manufactured by each of the defendants including their predecessors and successors.

27. At all times relevant to this action, the Smoker herein was (1) addicted to, purchased, and smoked cigarettes containing nicotine that were designed, manufactured, advertised, and marketed by all of the Defendants, and (2) did so in sufficient quantities and for a sufficient time paiod to cause or substantially contribute to causing injury or aggravation of a preexisting condition in the form of diseases and medical conditions, including the form of diseases and medical conditions that ultimately resulted in the injuries of the Smoker.

8pgNbr=155
28.       In Engle, the Florida Supreme Court approved certification for liability purposes of a class including all Florida citizens and residents, and their survivors, who have suffered, presently suffer, or who have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine.

29.       The Florida Supreme Court decertified the Engle class because class-wide treatment of causation and damages was not feasible. The Florida Supreme Court expressly reserved to class members, including Plaintiffs, the right to bring individual actions against Defendants for smoking-rclatcd injuries and damages, including punitive damages.

30.       Plaintiff asserts the jury findings from the Phase I Engle trial which were given res judicata effect by the Florida Supreme Court, including but not limited to the following:

a.      Smoking cigarettes causes aortic aneurysm, bladder cancer, cerebral vascular disease, cervical cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease (including cardiovascular disease, hardening of the arteries, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease and arteriosclerosis, angina, abnormal blood clotting, blood vessel damage, myocardial infarction (heart attack)), esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, laryngeal cancer, lung cancer (specifically, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma), complications of pregnancy, oral cavity/tongue cancer, pancreatic cancer, peripheral vascular disease, pharyngeal cancer, and stomach cancer.

b.      Nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.

c.      All Defendants placed cigarette on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous.

cjipgNbr=156
d.      All Defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available, knowing that the material was false or misleading, or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or both.

e.      AH Defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers and the public would rely on this information to their detriment.

f.       All Defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective.

g.      All Defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to representations of tact made by Defendants.

h.     All Defendants were negligent

31.       As a direct and proximate result of the Decedent's addiction to smoking Defendants' cigarettes, the Decedent suffered bodily injury and died. Defendants1 cigarettes caused the Decedent to develop one or more cigarette-related diseases or medical conditions that resulted in or substantially contributed to the Decedent's death. Plaintiff claims all damages allowed by the Florida Wrongful Death Act.

32.       Alternatively, in the event the Defendants contend that the Decedent died of some cause unrelated to smoking cigarettes, Plaintiff asserts a claim for survival damages pursuant to Section 46.021, Florida Statutes^ as the Decedent suffered past physical and mental and emotional pain and suffering, loss of enjoyment of life and medical expense for care and treatment. During the period before the Decedent died and in conjunction with an alternative survival claim, Plaintiff also asserts a loss of consortium claim and alleges as a direct and proximate result of the allegations contained in this Complaint, Plaintiff has suffered and will

10pgNbr=157
continue to suffer the loss of services, consortium, and care and comfort of the Decedent's society because of his injuries, disabilities and death, and has incurred expenses for medical treatment rendered to the Decedent

33.       Additionally, whether part of a wrongful death or survival claim, the Decedent's cigarette-related illnesses resulted in his sustaining aggravation of previously existing conditions, physical pain and suffering, mental and emotional distress, and medical expense,

34.       The Plaintiffs Decedent bears some measure of fault, but less than 100% of the applicable fault, for causing his respective smoking-related injuries and death. The Plaintiffs Decedent acts or omissions relating to the frequency and duration of his efforts to quit smoking were a partial proximate cause, in combination with the acts and omissions of Defendants, of his injuries, llic PlaintifF therefore seeks apportionment of fault and damages between the Decedent's survivors and Estate, and each Defendant who is responsible for damages on all Counts other than those alleging intentional torts.

35.       Venue is proper in this Circuit because, at all times material to this action, the Smoker either resided, suffered injuries or died in Palm Beach County, Florida.

Sublet Matter of Eipert Ttstfcnony

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds mainiains a state-of-the-art Research aad Development Department which employs and contracts with high quality scientific staff, engineers and technical personnel. Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the research and development of cigarettes* Reynolds's scientists have been recognized fur their expertise in identifying smoke constituents, quantifying yields of cigarette smoke constituents, reducing smoke constituent yields, and commercializing cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr, Borgerdkg will testify about Rjeynolds's historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products,

Dr, Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has earnestly responded to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products based upon the extensive research conducted in Reynolds's laboratories. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking, diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields, and substantially added to the scientific literature via its own scientific research.   He will testify about Reynolds's R&D library aad

4pgNbr=192
present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. He will testify about Reynolds's efforts to identify, develop, and implement cigarette designs that substantially reduce Smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine smoking methods mouth-level exposure measures, and studies of biomarkeTS. Dr. Borgcrding will testify that Reynolds has developed successful cigarette designs and - technologies that achieve significant reductions in smoke constiniBnts.

Dr. Borgcrding will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of thousands of individual chemical constituents. He will testify that cigarttte smoke contains more than HO chemical compounds identified by various governmental and public health entities as known, probable, or possible carcinogens by the U.S. ERA, 1ARC, or the U.S. National Toxicology Program.

Dr. Borgcrding will testify that, despite considerable technical obstacles, Reynolds has worked to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents associated will) the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify about criteria for new tobacco product development, including ensuring thai products do not introduce unintended consequences, finished products arc cojiaumer acceptable, technologies are feasible from a regulatory standpoint, and technologies arc feasible from a manufacturing standpoint. He will testify that over the years many market introductions by Reynolds and other cigarette manufacturers have achieved technical success in reducing smoke constituents but liave failed to achieve widespread consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such products, including carbon-ftltercd cigarettes, ,4demcotlni/^d" cigarettes, ultra-low yielding cigarettes, and tobacco-heating cigarettes.

Dr, Borgcrding may testify about cigarette test methods, including the Federal Trade Commissioii C'FTC') method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the

5pgNbr=193
conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He wilt testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including, snicker "compensation" as it generally relates to rnachine-mfiasured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. It is Dr. Borgerding's opinion that Reynolds has not designed its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC or any other cigarette test method. Dr. Borgerding will testify that ihe FTC method does not nor was it intended to, duplicate conditions of acrtuai human smoking and that the scientific and public health communities widely recognize that a broad range of smoking behaviors influence smoke yield and intake, He will testify that despite these variations, smokers of lower machine yield cigarettes, on average, receive less smoke than smokers of higher machine yield cigarettes/

Or. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds'^ efforts throughout the years to reduce "tarB and nicotine yields of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds's efforts to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields were a key guiding principle in the development and execution of its product designs and product technologies over the course of many decades.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: (I) general reduction and (2) selective reduction, In discussing general induction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about ihe cigarette design techniques Reynolds has used to achieve smoke yield reductions, including: filtration; filter ventilation; high/increased porosity cigarette paper(s); cigarette paper burn promoters; expanded tobaccos; reconstituted tobaccos; reduced tobacco weight; cigarette tod length reduction; reduced cigarette density; and reducer] rod circumference. He will testify ttiat, at all times, Reynolds's cigarettes conformed to the generally recognized state-of-trKvart in cigarette design and manufacture and used best available technologies to achieve consumerpgNbr=194
acceptance at given standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields. Dr. Borgerdiog will testify that Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies that arc in usfr in the marketplace today. He will testify about the incorporation of general reduction $echnoiogie over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have beca smoked in this case.

Dr. Borgerdmg will testify that Reynolds has modified its products in response to consumer demand for lower '"tar1" products ami government and public health flinhority recorflrnendations for reducing "tar" and nicotine yields as a means of reducing the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify that the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds have substantially lowered machine-measured "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will address the tradeoffs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar"' yields down by designing low "tar" and/or ultra low 'W brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Borgerding will also testify that genera! reduction techniques effectively reduce the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related to smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns and reduce the risks of cigarette smoking.

In discussing selective reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds's work in identifying and quantifying the toxicants of interest, developing technologies to accomplish specific toxicant reductions, and developing products that are commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will testify that Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years. Dr. Borgerding will testify aboutpgNbr=195
Reynolds's development of innovative cigarette designs, including tobacco heating products such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also testify about innovations in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about Reynolds's interactions with the public health community and government, incltiding the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and Reynolds's efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments on the development and evaluation of reduced risk products. We will discuss the fact that no U.S. governmental authority has ever recommended, mandated, acknowledged, or identified any alternative cigarette design to reduce the risks associated with cigarette snicking, la m effort to potentially reduce the risks of smoking, the European Union requires ail cigarette designs to yield no more than 10 nig lttar," 1 rag nicotine, and 10 nig CO, according to standard test procedures. Reynolds was a leader in technologies to develop cigarettes to achieve these mandated levels.

His testimony will describe Reynolds's product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Borgerding will also testify about studies in smokers sponsored by Reynolds, including yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds4? disctosuie of the ingredients used in its cigarettes (website, governmental reporting, and publications) and stewardship of ingredients.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about allegations of nicotine manipulation through altered cigarette design- He will testify that Reynolds has- not altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine or used ammonia for the pwposc of addicting smokers. He will testify thai research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase "free

8pgNbr=196
nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using machine methods.

Or. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds's corporate positions on smoking and health issues and statements about smoking and health issues on its website.

It is overly broad because, at a minimum, the identification of every publication Decedent ever "read" is not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.

to the best of my recollection, the Decedent smoked the following

brands:

13        A.  As I've indicated in earlier answers, I

14   think it's been well-known that stopping smoking

16   known for many decades.  It was generally something

3   that information has evolved over a period of time.   I

4             But I think as far as the fact that there   f

6   for many decades.  As far as the exact date of when

7   that was first known, I'm not sure.

16   expect some of those were definitely outside the

18   don't know the answer to that.

19        Q.   Prior to creating the research and

3        A.   That was about 1952, the early 1950s.

4   1952 or '3 roughly.

5        Q.   So if it was their job to pay attention

6   to smoking- and health-related issues, they would

7   have all the information the American public would

8   have had also, right?

9        A.   Again, you keep asking me sort of

10   rhetorical or hypothetical questions.  They would

11   have been actively trying to monitor and gather

12   scientific information.  That doesn't mean that any

13   of those things are a perfect process.  I'm

United Reporting, Inc.

954-525-2221pgNbr=284
1   no such thing as a cigarette that's devoid of all

2   risk.

3        Q.   Can you tell me how long Reynolds has

4   known that there is no such thing as a safe

5   cigarette?

6        A,   I don't know that I can tell you that

7   specifically.  I think that the information about

8   the risks of smoking evolved over a substantial

9   period of time.  It may evolve even further in the

10   future.

11             In terms of the view that there's risks

12   associated with the use of tobacco products, I

13   think that Reynolds has never disputed the early ~t       6piciemioiogy LiiaL triers was a statist-icax

18   to understand the basis of and to reduce.  It's

19   been a premise.

24   I think that scientists needed mechanism, which was

25   very difficult to understand given the complexity

'^WW^WSi^WWWWWWWt^

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221pgNbr=285

1       of the problem and still is an active area of research.

3             But even without that mechanism, without

4   the ability to definitively know there was a cause

5   and effect, the department operated under the

6   premise that it may be possible and conducted

7   extensive efforts to understand the composition of

8   tobacco; the composition of tobacco smoke; to

9   identify many of the 5,000 or more compounds that

10   are present; and to try and understand which ones

11   may be related to risk and to try and reduce those

13        Q.   So is it your position that from the

14   1950s R.J. Reynolds was working toward reducing the

15   risks associated with smoking although they did not

16   acknowledge that there were indeed risks associated

17   with smoking?

18        A.   It's my view that through their actions

19   the department acknowledged the possibility and zu       tinaL it was tne worKmg premise, tinati it was

21   possible; and there was a tremendous amount of

22   activity to try and build the scientific knowledge

23   around it.  That actually continues today.

2        A.   I'm not sure exactly what that would mean

3   other than they formed the department, and I'm

4   assuming that was public knowledge.  So in terms of

5   their studying tobacco and tobacco smoke, I think

6   that was understood and known; and they reported

7   their findings in the scientific literature.

8        Q.   And aside from someone having to infer

9   that because a research department was created that

10   there must be some acknowledgement of the

11   possibility of risk, R.J. Reynolds did not tell the

12   public by any statements that they were

13   acknowledging there was a possibility that their

6

10
	I should note that all of these things      j

11
	would be to bring out the natural flavors in         \

13
	there was something called "vanilla" added, it        j

14
	wouldn't be such that it would make the smoke taste   \

	like vanilla.  It would be something that would be    \

	presently - or what would be part of the smoke       j

18
	composition.

19
	Q.   And is there a reason why some of these

20

21
	It was based on the research that I         [

	throughout their career.  So it was named the         f

2
	Philip Morris award because Philip Morris had

3
	funded it as an award, but Philip Morris wasn't       \

13        A.   As an individual and in my experience

14   with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, R.J. Reynolds

15   Tobacco Company is a company that competes with

16   other companies that sell tobacco products.  So our

21        Q.   In the time that you have worked for

22   r.j. Reynolds -- so from 1980 until the present

23   day  what kind of changes have you seen in the 2 4       company? 25       A.   Tremendous changes, a wide range of

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221pgNbr=294
Page 161

1   changes.  The scientific knowledge has expanded

2   tremendously.  Wefve learned a lot in that time

3   scientifically.  In terms of the company and its

4   products, those have changed.  In terms of

5   cigarettes, cigarette smoking has declined

6   significantly.  There are many things that have

7   changed.

8        Q.   You said cigarette smoking has declined.

9   Is R.J. Reynolds happy with that result?

10        A.   I don't know that I can put a human

11   emotion on a company.  You've just asked me to

12   declare as a company happy.  I can tell you that

13   our views are articulated on our website in terms

14   of our guiding principles and beliefs.  And that

15   R.J. Reynolds' guiding principle and belief is that

16   anyone that would like to stop smoking should.  And

17   for those that want to stop smoking but don't want

18   to stop using tobacco products, they should

19   consider other products.  So that is part of

20   transforming tobacco.

24        A.   I don't know that it would be a motto.  I

25   think that that's an articulation of our current

United Reporting, Inc.

954-525-2221pgNbr=295
Page 162

1   approach to our business as a company.

2             In terms of understanding the risks of

3   smoking; that is, understanding what compounds in

4   tobacco or smoke may be responsible for the risks

5   of smoking and developing products that potentially

6   reduce those risks or reduce exposure, that's been

7   something that's gone on for many decades.

8             As far as transforming tobacco, that's

9   something more recently that has been put forward

10   as something for all of our company to understand.

12        Q.   How long has the Camel Snus been on the

13   market for?

14        A.   If I recall correctly, I believe Camel

15   Snus may have been introduced in about 2006.

16        Q.   So had Irwin Weinstein wanted to quit

17   smoking because he was aware of the risks of

18   smoking or for whatever reason, before 2005, which

19   is when he passed away, and he was addicted to the

20   nicotine -- I would like you to assume that he was

22   would have been no alternative for him to move to

23   in terms of R.J. Reynolds' products, right?

24             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

25        A.   It would depend upon the time frame.

1 0
	A.   I would agree that in terms of smoking      |

19
	that generally when smokers smoke, they puff, they

20
	inhale.  Not all necessarily inhale, but that they

1   several answers to earlier questions.  I think it's

2   for a wide range of reasons.

3        Q.   Do you believe that nicotine in

4   cigarettes permanently changes the brain?

5        A.   I don't know that it permanently changes

6   it.  It clearly interacts with the brain.  As far

7   as permanent change, I'm not sure about that.

8        Q.   Do you agree that the tobacco companies

9   intentionally designed cigarettes with enough

10   nicotine to create and sustain addiction?

11        A.   No, I would not agree with that as it's

12   stated.  I don't think if there is such a value

13   that it's a single value.  To my knowledge, that's

14   an active area of research.  The FDA is trying to

16   is addictive versus a level that is not.  As with

17   all behaviors and the fact that people are

18   different from one to the next, I doubt there's a

19   single value.

20             That being said 

21        Q.   Do you know if  go ahead.

22        A.   That being said, when cigarettes are

23   developed, they're developed in terms of producing

24   a rod with a certain amount of tobacco.  The bulk

25   of that tobacco is not burned to form mainstream

	based upon how an individual smoker smokes the

10
	A.   As you've phrased the question, I think

12
	necessarily -- that such a thing could be done and    I

13
	the company hasn't done that.

14
	What we have done is various kinds of      I

 i

3             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

4        A.  Reynolds doesn't add nicotine to

5   cigarettes.

6   BY MS. CHAMBERS:

7        Q.   Have they ever done experiments which

8   included manipulating the levels of nicotine?

9        A.   I'm not sure what you would mean by

10   "manipulating the levels of nicotine."  But

11   Reynolds has done a tremendous amount of research

12   to develop cigarette designs that would reduce the

13   yields of tar and nicotine.

14        Q.   Would you agree that low-tar and filtered

15   cigarette smokers inhale essentially the same

16   amount of tar and nicotine as they would from

17   regular cigarettes?

18        A.   I'm not sure what you mean by "regular

19   cigarettes."  Again, in terms of cigarettes in

20   general, it doesn't matter what specific brand, the

21   primary driver of what's yielded from the cigarette

22   is the smoker's behavior.

23        Q.   So in reality, if a cigarette has a lower

24   level of tar and nicotine, it would not make a

25   difference as to how much tar and nicotine the

1   should behave or at least an individual that works

2   for our government; and I would suggest that anyone

3   that works for our government should abide by all

4   laws and regulations.

5             As far as each scientific matter, how

6   that's communicated will depend upon the nature of

7   what's going on, a study or whatever; but I think

8   that's something that should be done according to

9   the laws and according to the regulations that are

10   relevant.

11   BY MS. CHAMBERS:

12        Q.   Is it your opinion that cigarettes today

13   are less dangerous than cigarettes that were

14   manufactured in the '40s or '50s?

15        A.   Yes.  It's my view that the epidemiology

16   shows very clearly that smoking filtered cigarettes

17   has less risk associated with it than smoking

18   nonfiltered cigarettes.

19        Q.   So the cigarettes that Irwin Weinstein

20   smoked in the '40s and '50s were more dangerous

21   than the cigarettes that are available on the

22   market today?

23             MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

24        A.   In terms of the 1950s -- in part, it

25   would depend upon what time in the 1950s because

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221pgNbr=307

	various designs happened.  But risk is not just

5
	So as far as his particular situation, I

6
	don't believe that I can answer that as such.  What

7
	I can tell you is that in terms of the

8
	epidemiology, the risk for example for lung cancer

9
	is greater for a smoker of nonfiltered products       |

10
	than it is for a smoker of filtered products.         |

13

	Q.   Would they have had more carcinogens in     j

18
	them than the cigarettes manufactured today?         !

19
	A.   Again, the yields of the products would     j

20
	have been greater.  I don't think there would have

21
	been more carcinogens, if by "more" you mean the

22
	number of different compounds that have been         [

23
	reported to be cancer-causing.                       \

25   of ingesting the carcinogens that were in             [

1   cigarettes as compared to the cigarettes that they

2   manufacture today?

3        A.   Depending upon how he smoked, yes.

4   Generally, the yields of products at that point in

5   time would have been greater than the yields of

6   many products today.

7        Q.   And that would be due to the certain

8   governmental regulations that are on tobacco

9   products today, right?

10        A.   I'm not sure what you mean by that, but I

11   don't believe that would be -- I don't believe your iz       question, it it s consioereu an answer, is correct,

13   no.

14        Q.   In your disclosure it says that you'll

15   testify that "despite considerable technical

16   obstacles, Reynolds has worked to reduce or

19                            What do you mean "considerable technical

21        A.   I think what that's intended to mean very

22   simply on the surface is this is incredibly complex

23   scientifically, it's incredibly complex from a

Zi       practical or a manufacturing stancpoint to cto tne

1   It's taken tremendous effort, tremendous resource

2   to achieve the things that we have.

3             And so just one example in that regard

4   would be the reductions of tobacco-specific o       nitrosamines m xxue-cureo. tooacco.  inese are

6   compounds that at one point in time weren't

7   understood to be associated with risk.  Generally,

8   at least in the 1970s or '80s, they became

9   compounds that were being considered as ones that

10   may be associated with the risk; and it was not

11   known where they came from.  What was known was for

12   flue-cured tobacco they weren't present in the

13   tobacco as it was grown in the field.

14             So to even discern that, it took a lot of

15   technology to develop ways to actually be able to

16   measure for such compounds.  Once we had the

17   technical capability to measure such compounds, we

18   had to conduct large experiments, large studies to

19   try to find out where nitrosamines came from.

20   There were various prevailing theories.  A number

21   of those, after a lot of effort, it turned out were

22   wrong.

23             Once we did find out where they were

Ol

24   coming from, we had to verify that finding, we had    I o)

	A.   I'm not in our financial area.  I don't     \

10
	reported publicly in the annual report and I          |

4   plaintiffs in this case were asking you.

5             I fii~st want to talk to you about

6   nicotine and addiction.  You were asked a number of

7   questions about nicotine and addiction and what

8   R.J, Reynolds has done.  Do you generally recall

9   being asked questions in those areas? 10       A.   Yes.

1       Q.   Okay.  I want to follow up,

12             Let's first start off, does Reynolds 

13   does R.J. Reynolds add nicotine to its cigarettes?

14        A.   No.

15        Q.   Has it ever done so in the cigarettes

16   that it sold to consumers like Mr. Weinstein?

17        A.   No.

18        Q.   Why is it that cigarettes, including

19   R.J. Reynolds' cigarettes, contain nicotine?

21   because tobacco contains nicotine.  Nicotine is

22   naturally present in tobacco.  Tobacco is part of

23   the cigarette, and that's why there's nicotine in

21
	affected the nicotine yield of its products?          f

22
	A.  Yes.  Examples of the types of technology

23
	would be something that we refer to as

24
	general-reduction technologies.  So they would

25
	include for example inclusion of reconstituted

	tobacco in the blend or inclusion of expanded

	uouacco, cnanges in r,ne nature or cne cigarette

3
	paper

4
	For filtered cigarettes they would

5
	include the filter itself, as well as the way in

6
	which the filter is made; may include ventilation

7
	within the filter.  So these are examples of the

8
	many kinds of technologies that have been

9
	incorporated into cigarette designs to reduce the

10
	yields of tar and nicotine.

	sheet.  For how long has that been incorporated      [

3
	Q.   And what was the consequence or the

4
	effect on the tar and nicotine yields of Tareyton

5
	as those technologies were incorporated into that

6
	product?

v
	A.   The yields of the Tareyton cigarette also

8
	decreased as those technologies were introduced and

9
	ultimately was decreased quite substantially on the

10
	same order as the values I indicated earlier.

11
	Q.   Let me switch topics, Doctor.

12
	Are you aware of certain cigarette brands

13
	that have been marketed at various points in time

14
	that have been claimed to either be denicotinized

15
	or nicotine-free?

	t\.   i6si i am.

17
	Q.  Can you give us an example of a brand or

18
	two that was advertised as such?

19
	A.   They would have been brands with names

20
	such as Merit DeNic, Benson & Hedges DeNic, Next,

21
	King Santo.  There were products known as a Quest

22
	brand.  So a number of different products over the

23
	years.

24
	Q.   Did those cigarette products contain

25   tobacco?

2
	Q.   And despite being advertised as either

3
	denicotinized or nicotine-free, did those

4
	cigarettes also contain some measurable amounts of

5
	nicotine?                                        [

6
	A.   Yes.  They all contained some measurable    \

7
	amounts of nicotine.  Some actually contained a

8
	substantial amount of nicotine.

9
	Q.   In general, have those products claimed

10
	to be denicotinized been consumer acceptable?         j

11
	A.   No.  They've not found acceptance with      [

17
	A.   No.  For something to be viable in terms

18
	of harm reduction, the product itself has to have     j

19
	the potential to reduce risk; and smokers have to     \
 l

20
	prefer that to other products and actually smoke

21
	it.  So it has to be both consumer acceptable and

22
	have the potential to reduce exposure.

23

reduction?

2        A.   No.  They've not found widespread

3   consumer acceptance.  They haven't even found small

4   amounts of consumer acceptance in most cases.

5        Q.   And those products, by virtue of

6   continuing to yield tar and carcinogens and

7   irritants, compared to cigarettes that have typical

8   amounts of nicotine, is there any basis to conclude

9   that they are in fact less risky?

10        A.   No.

11        Q.   And why is that?

12        A.  Because those cigarettes would yield all

13   the toxicants that have been reported to be

15   someone were to smoke them, they would still be

16   exposed to those toxicants.  And, in fact, people

17   don't find them acceptable.  So if they were able

18   to reduce exposure to toxicants, people wouldn't

19   smoke them anyway.

22   areas that they have on the general research plan

5   BY MR. KREINER:

6        Q.   Was Reynolds ever able to introduce into

7   the commercial product -- into the commercial

8   market a cigarette that actually met that objective

9   of either maintaining or increasing nicotine

10   relative to tar?

11        A.   No.

13       about whether Reynolds has designed its cigarettes

iHt       to eitner create or sustain addiction.  .Let me asx

15   you the question directly.

16             To your knowledge has Reynolds ever

17   designed any of its commercial cigarettes to create

18   or sustain addiction?

19        A.   No.

20        Q.   Have you ever been in a meeting in your

21   30-plus years at R.J. Reynolds where someone in the

22   company has said that Reynolds should design its

/* *\                 a.   NO/ xnavent.

25       Q.   Have you ever seen a single document in

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221pgNbr=328
Page 195

1   all your involvement in this litigation and in your

2   three-plus decades at R.J. Reynolds that says

3   Reynolds internally believes that it should design

4   its cigarettes to create and sustain addiction?

5        A,   No, I haven't.

6        Q.   I want to switch topics and talk about

7   transforming tobacco.

8             Doctor, you were asked some questions

9   about this.  Could you briefly explain to us what

10   you mean with respect to Reynolds' focus on

11   transforming tobacco?

12        A.   Yes.  Reynolds' approach to transforming

14   those is around harm reduction  something that

15   I've addressed in some of the questions and answers

16   throughout the day today  and trying to

17   understand what drives the risks of smoking and to

18   develop products that would reduce exposure and

19   would reduce risk.  And that would be true not only

20   for cigarettes but for a range of tobacco products.

21             So part of the concept is that of

22   migrating smokers away from using a combustible

23   tobacco product.  If they want to keep using

24   tobacco, for them to have options other than

25   something that would burn tobacco.  So it's all of

United Reporting, Inc.

954-525-2221pgNbr=329

	Page 196 j

1
	those things together in the area of harm            |

2
	reduction.                                          \

3
	For any given product, trying to reduce

4
	exposure and risk for that type of product and

5
	trying to provide a range of products for those

6
	that want to use tobacco products.

7
	Another element of transforming tobacco

8
	would be accelerating the decline in youth smoking.

9
	Currently youth smoking rates are at a historic

10
	low, and this is something that Reynolds actively     \

11
	is trying to accelerate through interactions with

12
	states and the legislative process and so on, for     j

13
	example, as well as educational materials.

14
	Another area is just the area of trying     \

15
	to have a product integrity plan.  So a product

16
	integrity plan would be one that is focused on       |

17
	maKing our products to specifications, to try to      \

18
	make sure that nothing that we do would increase     |

19
	x.ne innerent risK, tne risK unat s already present    \

20
	in products, while also trying to reduce risk; and

21
	then also would involve complying with all the       j

22
	appropriate laws and regulations.

23
	So these are elements of transforming

24
	tobacco.  As part of it, too, we have a focus on

25  trying to be as innovative as possible and to try
	
ro

	to move that forward as quickly as possible,          f

2
	Q.   Does R.J, Reynolds publicly state its       f

3
	goals and objectives with respect to transforming     J

4
	tobacco?

5
	A.   Yes.                                      |

6
	Q.   Including on its website?

7
	A.   Yes.

8
	Q.   Does Reynolds have an opinion that it      |

9
	expresses on its website as to whether or not

10
	smokers who are concerned about their health should   \

11
	stop using tobacco products?

12
	A.   Yes, they do.

13
	Q.   What is Reynolds' position in that regard   [

14
	that it states publicly on its website?

15
	A.   It states that the best course of action
 i;

16
	for those that are concerned about the risks of      I

17
	smoking is to quit.                                 j

18
	\ Q.   And if people want to continue using        j

19
	tobacco products but quit cigarettes, what does

20
	Reynolds offer to those consumers?                   I

21
	A.   Reynolds guiding principle and belief is

22
	l. n a l tor rnose mar are concerned sdoul l n e risK

23
	but don't want to stop using tobacco products, they
 1

24
	should consider tobacco products that have been

954-525-2221pgNbr=331
Page 198

1   consider other products, such as NRT.

2        Q.   And I don't want to repeat everything

3   that you were talking about with respect to

4   questions that Ms. Chambers asked you; but if you

5   could briefly just highlight for us, what products

6   has Reynolds made available to consumers along that

7   continuum of risk that are less risky than

8   cigarettes for people who want to choose to use

9   them?

10             MS. CHAMBERS:  Object to form.

11        A.   In terms of the tobacco product risk

12   continuum, first of all there are combustible

13   tobacco products.  So cigarettes, "traditional"

14   cigarettes -- I'll use that term  that is,

15   cigarettes that burn down and burn tobacco would be

16   at one end of the risk continuum scale.

17             Reynolds also has a cigarette, Eclipse,

18   which primarily heats rather than burns tobacco.

19   The studies that we've conducted show that if a

20   smokers switches from using a traditional type of

21   cigarette to the Eclipse cigarette, their exposure

22   to carcinogens is potentially reduced in a

23   significant way.  So those would be in the area of

24   cigarettes.

25             There's also then, rather than

1   combustible products, noncombustible products.

2   They would generally have, according to

3   epidemiology and so on, a lower-risk profile for

4   smoking-related diseases; and so those would

6       dissolvables.

/                            In addition to that, as 1 ve indicated,

8   Reynolds has worked through service-level

9   agreements with a sister company, another company

10   that's wholly owned by Reynolds American, to

11   develop nicotine-replacement therapy products.  So

13   It would be a nicotine-containing product that

14   doesn't have any tobacco associated with it at all.

15             And then one other point on the risk

16   continuum would be the concept of and the

17   implementation of electronic cigarettes.  So these

18   are something that have come about more recently.

19   They are something that also does not burn tobacco,

20   does not contain tobacco, and would reduce exposure A\.       to toxicants.

22        Q.   And are Reynolds' efforts -- are

23   Reynolds' efforts to continue to transform tobacco

24   and migrate consumers who want to continue using

25   tobacco products to less risky forms of tobacco and

8             Why does Reynolds use additives in some

9   of its cigarettes?

10        A.   Reynolds uses additives in some of its

11   cigarettes to distinguish the taste of one brand

12   from another, to provide a unique taste signature.

13   So the additives are something that will bring out

16   unique in terms of the taste to distinguish one

17   brand from another.

18             That being said, Reynolds' guiding

19   principles and beliefs are to use the least amount

20   of additives as possible to arrive at a particular

21   taste signature and to evaluate and never add

22   anything to cigarettes that would increase the risk

23   of using the product.

2
	Q.   Why not?

3
	A.   Not all smokers prefer a taste that would   |

	Q.   And just very briefly, Doctor, can you      j

18
	explain to us what the purpose of the product         j

19
	stewardship program is and a little bit about how     |

20
	that program is used to ensure that nothing          j

21
	Reynolds does makes cigarette smoking more           f

22
	dangerous?

23
	A.   Yes.  The product stewardship program is

24
	the implementation of our guiding principle that we

25
	will not do anything to our products or add          [

954-525-2221pgNbr=336
Page 203

1   anything to our products that would increase the

2   inherent risk.

3             So anytime that something is being

4   considered as far as a change to a product or an

5   entirely new product design, if there was to be a

6   change in the additives for example, that would not

7   be implemented before that proposed change was

8   stewarded.

9             So that means that toxicologists would

10   meet with product developers, would go through the

11   process of understanding what was being proposed,

12   would research what was known about whatever is

13   involved in the process.  Depending upon the level

15   requirement to develop an extensive program of

16   testing.  And basically the proposed change would

17   be evaluated from the standpoint of a product with

18   and without it, in terms of chemistry and biology

19   and so on; but data would be generated and

20   evaluated by toxicologists before such a change

21   would be approved.

22             So, again, nothing that we add would

23   increase the risks.  If our testing showed that it

24   did, that would not be implemented.

15   graphic warnings generally in that lawsuit?

16        A.   No.

17        Q.   What was the general nature of the

18   lawsuit as you understand it?

19        A.  My understanding of that lawsuit is that

20   Reynolds was not challenging factual warnings, that

21   they were challenging the graphics on grounds

22   around the First Amendment, if I understand things

23   right, as well as data from the FDA studies

25       not effective in the way that the FDA said that

1
	they intended them to be used.

2
	So it was a number of things, but my        f

3
	understanding is there were constitutional issues     1

4
	involved and that the court agreed.

9
	A.   There has been, yes.

10
	Q.   And what did the trial court decide?

11
	A.   The trial court agreed and said the

12

	yes.

4
	decided with respect to Reynolds' position in that

6
	A.  My understanding is they also agreed that

7
	Reynolds' position was correct.

8
	Q.   Now, you made reference to some recent      j

9
	activity with respect to that lawsuit.  What is

10
	your current understanding of where that lawsuit     |

11
	sits?

12
	A.  My current understanding is that           j

13
	recently  I believe it's the Department of

14
	Justice -- but the FDA has indicated that they will   ?

15
	not pursue that any further, that they will not       J

16
	appeal it to the Supreme Court, that they will        j

17
	proceed, rather, in trying to move forward with

18
	something that will comply with the act itself.       j

19
	Q.   I want to just touch very briefly on one    \

20
	last topic, Doctor.                                   j
