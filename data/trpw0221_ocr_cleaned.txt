Q.  Please state your full name.

A.  My name is James Figlar.

Q.  Good morning, Dr. Figlar.  My name is Gary Paige.  You and I have met a couple times in the past.  I'm sure you understand the rules of a deposition, but I'm going to be asking you some qiiestions, and if you don't understand my question or you don't know the answer, just feel free to let me know, okay?

A.  I will try.

Qt    And if you need any breaks, you let us

know as well, okay?

A.  Absolutely.

Q.  And this is not the first time that you've given a deposition in a tobacco oase, is it?

A.  No, sir, it is not.

Q.  And how many depositions have you given in the past?

A.  I have not counted recently, but I would say it'8 certainly over 65 depositions.

Q.  Okay. And most of them have been in the past three or four years, correct?

A.  Since about '09 I would say, something like that.

Q.  Okay.  And my understanding is before you gave any deposition at all in any case you spent about a year reviewing documents and meeting with lawyers; is that correct?

A.  Approximately.

Q.  And so now you've been designated as this ocise  in this oase as the corporate representative with most knowledge of certain subject matters; is that correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objeot -- object to the form. THE WITNESS:  In general, that is my understanding.

years, and I have -- obviously in the Duvall County deposition I spent a great deal of time reviewing a lot of those documents, and I've reviewed many of the documents that you sent with regard to this subject.  So I think I'm reasonably well prepared to take the deposition.

 MR.

epidemiology or the early parts of the epidemiology that came out at that time frame, yes.

Q.     Okay.  So what is your understanding about the article that was published by Wynder and Graham in 1953? What -- what was that article and what was the significance of it?

A.  Well, if it's the article I'm thinking of, which I'm thinking it is the epidemiology as opposed to the other -- some other scientific articles, then they would have suggested that there may be an association between lung cancer and cigarette smoking or they first made that proposition in the early '50s.

0^  Okay. And did that article and those findings receive a lot of publioity in 1953?

A.  I would say it did.  There were other articles of similar ilk in the earlier '50s, and I think 1950, that also made those kind of suggestions and was widely publicized.

Q.  Okay.  What * what ~~ Doctor, I want to talk about some outstanding articles  studies of those articles, but what  you tell me what you're talking about.

look at it, but I -- I thought you were talking about Wynder and Graham's discussion of epidemiology.  I know there was a -- I think it was a Hill article in 1950 from Britain, Doll and Hill, I think, if my memory serves me right.  That was another epidemiology discussion.

If you're talking about mouse skin painting, I'm aware of that as well.

Q.  Okay.  So you are aware of the mouse skin painting study and article that came out in 1953 from Wynder and Graham?

A.  Uh-huh, yes.

Q.  Okay.  And are you aware that that article linked cigarette smoking to lung cancer?

A.  I'm aware that they suggested that in general terms because they believed that they painted cigarette tars on the backs of mice and produced -- were able to produce skin tumors, so tfiat was a suggestion.

Q.  Okay.  And did that article receive a lot of publicity back in 1953?

A.  Sure, that one did as well. Uh-huh.

Q.  And following that -- that -- the publicity of that article in 1953, was -- do you know when in relationship to that article was

when was the TIRC formed?

A.  I think the TIRC was formed in 1954, so probably a year or so after that article.

Q.  And are you aware of the ~~ the Frank Statement to cigarette smokers? A.  Yes, I am.

(Figlar Exhibit 1, Dooument titled Preliminary Recommendations for Cigarette Manufacturers dated 12/24/53, PT02166, was marked for identification.) BY MR. PAIGE: Q,     Okay.  I want to show you Exhibit 1 to your deposition, and see if we oan talk about that

A.  I did.

A.  I believe this is -- this is discussion of a! meeting that was to be held, and I think it's a  x  believe it's a Hill  Knowlton document.

Q.  Okay.  And it's dated December 24th, 1953, cjorreot?

A.  It is, yes.

Q. And if you could go to the last page of that document and read into the record who was pjresent at this meeting.

A.  Do you want me to read the titles as well?

Q. Well, if you could read the last page of the document and tell the jury who was present at the meeting, please?

A.  It says Paul M. Hahn, president, American Tobacco; Joseph F. Cullman, Jr., chairman and president of Benson & Hedges; 0. Parker McComas, President, Philip Morris & Company; J. Whitney Peterson, President, U.S. Tobacco Company; and then there's dots and it says, P. Lorillard Company.

discussing the mouse painting study and the publicity that it received? Are you aware of that?

A.  If my memory serves me, I think they're talking about that and general issues facing the industry with regard to potential associations between cigarette smoking and disease.

Q.  Okay.  And can you read the second paragraph of this document into the record for the jury, please.

A.  Certainly.  On Page 1?

Q,     Yes.

A. Second paragraph reads, these developments have confronted the industry with a serious problem of public relations. Obviously, that problem would be quickly solved if the adverse publicity would cease and people would stop talking about the whole matter.

Q. And when they're talking about the whole matter, do you know what matter they're referring to?

A.  Well, I believe they're talking about smoking and health concerns, which they point out in the earlier paragraph in those reports.

Q. And could you turn to the next --if you cbuld turn to the next page, please, and read

the -- the -- the second paragraph that starts out the situation is one.  Can you publish that into the record for the jury, please?

A.  It reads, the situation is one of extreme delicacy.  There is much at stake and the industry group, in moving into the field of public relations, needs to exercise great care not to add fuel to the flames.

Q.  Now, again, when they're talking about the situation being one of extreme delicacy, do you khow what situation they're referring to?

A.  Well, I mean, I believe it would be  they're talking about the articles that are coming out and the potential links between cigarette smoking and ** and health outcomes

Q. Now, if you can go down two more paragraphs to the one, two, three, four ~- fifth paragraph and sixth paragraph which starts with the underlying purpose.

In this document, do they discuss the purpose of Hill & Knowlton and the TIRC?

A.  I don't know about TIRC particular, but I believe the purpose of public relations, as I pointed out in the last one, I think they would discuss what that would be.

Q.  Okay.  Can you read into the ~- into the record those two paragraphs that start with the underlying purpose, please.

A.  Sure.  The underlying purpose of any activity at this stage should be reassurance of the public through wider communication of facts to the public  It is important that the public recognise the existence of weighty scientific views which hblds there is no proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer.

In connection with this ~- with the proposed activity, it is impossible to overlook the fact that some of the industry's advertising has come in for serious public oritioism because of emphasis on health aspects of smoking.

Q.  And when they're talking about advertising and the effects of advertising, do you know what they were referring to -- what type of advertisement they were referring to?

A. Not necessarily.  I'm not an 

Q. Well

A.  I'm aware the industry had ads like that. I've seen those in the past in connection with litigation.  But I don't -- you know, I'm not the person most knowledgeable in marketing activities and what the direction and intent would be.

Q.  Okay.  So when the  when they're talking about the  the  okay.  So the -- the  the next part of this document, if you can go to the third page, they're talking about the following recommendations are submitted for consideration by the manufacturers; do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q. And the Number 2 it says, they want to fbrm a committee called the Tobacco Research Committee; do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q. And did they actually do that? Did they do that, form a committee called the Tobaooo Research Committee?

A.  I  I believe in general they did, yes.

Q.    Okay.  And on the next page, on Number 4, it talks about a public statement by cigarette makers; do you see that?

Q.  Well, it says the  the public -- the first public statement should be designed, if you could read that paragraph.

A.  Okay.  It says the  the first public statement of the committee should be designed to clarify the problem and to reassure the public that, (a), the industry's first and foremost interest is the public health; (b) there is no proof of the claims which link smoking and lung cancer; and (c) the industry is inaugurating a joint plan to deal with the situation.

It goes on to say, this statement should be:  (a), distributed widely as news, and to employees, stockholders, distributors, tobaooo growers, dealers, suppliers, public officials, national and committee leaders and other groups; (b) placed as an advertisement in leading

Q. Do you think, as the corporate representative for R. J. Reynolds, do you agree that it was  well, do you agree that it was important that the interests of public health be first and foremost?

A,  I mean, I agree that that's what's said here.  1 think it is important, so yeah, I mean, in general I agree.

Q. And that was something that they were going to reassure the public that they would do that, right?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, I mean, that's what  that's what it says here, so I would say yes. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.. And then they also wanted to reassure the public that there was no proof of the claims which link smoking and lung cancer, correct?

A.  They -- they  they did want that message to get out, yes, that's correct.

the time, as far as they saw it, so, yeah, they certainly wanted that message out there. BY MR. PAIGE: Q. And why would they want the message out there to reassure the public that there was no pjroof?

A. Because they didn't believe that the  that the science supported a direct link between smoking and disease, and especially in the 1950s there was a lot of question about whether or not that link could be established. So ~-Q.  And they wanted --

A.  -- they certainly -- they didn't want people to draw that conclusion before -- before it could be looked at more thoroughly.

Q.  Exactly.  They didn't want the public to conclude that and they didn't want the public to believe that, right?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Again, they ~ the -- the thought at the time was that that certainly was not the oase, so, yeah, they wouldn't -- they wouldn't have want that. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  So if smokers in 1950s did not yet believe

that smoking caused lung cancer, that would have been appropriate based upon what you know as the corporate representative of R. J. Reynolds, correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know that I can speak for smokers in the '50s, but certainly the  the soience would have suggested that a causal link would be inappropriate to make at that point in time.

Q.  Do you know how many newspapers?

A.  The exact number, I don't.  I think somewhere around 400.

Q.  400 newspapers?

A.  Okay.  It says, Number 2, for this purpose we are establishing a joint industry group consisting initially of the undersigned.  This group will be known as the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

Q.  So that was when the publio was first advised that the TIRC was being formed, correct?

A.  They were advised, yes.

Q.  And it was at the same time that the public was being informed that there was no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung cancer, correct?

1   tobaooo industry that there is no proof that

2   cigarette smoking is one of the causes of lung

3   cancer, correct?

4        A.  That was certainly the industry's position

5   at that time, so that would have been one of the

6   messages that people could have heard.

7        Q.    And in the Frank Statement the cigarette

8   industry told the publio that we accept an interest

9   in people's health as a basic responsibility

10   paramount to every other consideration in our

11   business; do you see that? Did I read that

12   correctly?

13        A.  You did, yes.

14        Q.  So you would agree that that would mean to

15   th public that they would  they were putting

16   people's health paramount and more important than

17   profits?

18            MR. LATHAM;  Object to the form.

19            THE WITNESS:  They said it's a basic

20       responsibility and it's paramount to every

21       other consideration. So I think that's a

22       reasonable interpretation.  It certainly would

23       be important to the companies.

A.  It would.

Q.  So at that point, any smoker who was reading this could be assured that there was no --at least conceivably be assured by the cigarette companies that there was no proof that smoking caused lung cancer, that their health was more important to the cigarette manufacturer than making money would be, and that they were going to form this TIRC, correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I mean, I think  I think that's a possibility.  Certainly if some  certainly that is the industry position.  The position was stated correctly in the Frank Statement.  The company certainly believed what they were saying in the Frank Statement, and they certainly formed the TIRC to do the things that they said the TIRC would do. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  What is the Tobacco Institute? A.  The Tobacco Institute is an industry advocacy group that was basically split off from this original TIRC in, I think, 1958 or thereabouts.

Q.  And was the --so tho TIRC was supposed to

A.  I think after the TIRC was formed in the 1950s there were  there were some statements made.  There were obviously news programs.  It was a news item. And so the TIRC was contacted and I think mostly the chairman, I think it was Dr. Little, made a number of statements, but I believe others did as well.

Q.  Okay. And the Tobacco Institute, as well, they would also make public statements, oorreot?

A,  Again, once the Tobaooo Institute was formed and broken off from the TIRC they would, yds.

Q,  And the purpose of these public statements was to inform the public, oorreot?

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  The purpose of the statements was, especially in terms of the Tobacco Institute, was to make sure the public understood where -- what the industry's positions were on these matters.  The Tobacco Institute was an advocacy group for the industry, not unlike any othor advocmoy group

BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  You wanted people to be able to read --r^ad the position of the tobacco industry, take it seriously and oonsider it to be credible information, right?

A.  I would say in general, yeah, that would H true.  The Tobacco Institute spoke for the industry.  The industry had its views that were bjtsed in the way they viewed the scienoe, and so, y^ah, they would want those views considered by those who heard them as one of the sets of information that people would get to be informed on

with the most knowledge from R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, do you have an understanding that Mr. James P. Richards was the president of the Tobacco Institute in 1958?

A.  I have no reason to dispute it, it's written right here in the article.

Q.  Okay.  And you can go to the second paragraph and read the quote from Mr. Richards into the record, please.

A.  Sure.  Starting with the implications?

Q.  The second paragraph, sir.

A.  Okay.  It says, the cigarette industry has not ohangod its nind. Our position was and is based on the fact that scientific evidence does not support the theory that there is anything in cigarette smoke known to cause human lung cancer.

Q.  And I'm sorry, I don't  I don't mean to interrupt you.  The piece that he's talking about, he's responding to an artiole that says smoking does cause lung cancer, correct?

A.  They're talking about a - I believe it says a Digest -* the  a Digest artiole?

Q.    A Reader's Digest?

A.  I don't know -- it doesn't say Reader's Digest, but it says Digest.  Oh, it is Reader's Digest.  I'm sorry.

It says the Cigarette Industry Changes Its Mind was the name of the article.  So they're talking about a Reader's Digest artiole.

Q.  Right.  What Mr. Richards is saying in that next paragraph is the implications of the pieoe, the article, are most unfair to the tobacco industry and to the general publio, oorreot?

A.  Correct.

Q.     So being fair to the general public is important; you would agree with that, correct?

A.  It would, yes.

Q.    Being fair and honest would be important, not only for Reader's Digest,  but also for the tobacco industry,   correct?

A.  Certainly.

Q. And if you could read the next paragraph. A.  It says "the Tobaooo Institute, Mr. Richards continued, "believes that the health

o\t  people is more important than dividends for any

i industry. We are equally convinced that the

American people believe in fair play for an

industry that historically began and grew with the

Q.     And then trust and fair play should also be important for your consumers as well, correct?

A.  Certainly.

Q.  And where it says the -- the industry  the Tobacco Institute believes the health of the pjeople is more important than dividends, that would ba important not only in 1958, but also 1968, 1978, 1988, 1998, that the publio health be more important than dividends; would you agree with t^at?

A.  I would, yes,

Q. And if the tobaooo industry put dividends or profits over public health you would agree that would be wrong?

A.  I " I ***** I think in a general sense I wbuld, yes.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I would say so, yes. (Figlar Exhibit 4, Letter dated 2/S/58 to John W. Hill from Paul M. Hahn, PT01563, was marked for identification.) BY MR. PAIGE: Q.

Q. Okay.  So the -- was the public ever advised in any public statement that that was the objective of the tobacco industry -- of the Tobacco institute, to defend the industry against attacks from whatsoever source on tobacco as an alleged health hazard?

A.  Were they - are you asking me if they were informed of the objectives?  I think it was --you know, I don't know if they were informed in that way and said, these are the objectives of the Tobacco Institute, but I mean I think it's been pretty clear that the statements made by the Tobacco institute and their actions would support what this statement is, which is they put out what the companies' positions were on the science and certainly disseminated them.

Q,  You're saying the company's position, wouldn't it be important to put out what the --what the belief and -- what the belief was, not just the position, but the belief of the company?

A.  Well, the position and the belief are the slamo.  As far as I could tell from my understanding o!f the documents, the industry did have those

2   the science was not there, that there was not

3   ehough evidence to implicate cause and effect, so

4   that's what I have seen in the documents.

A.  He -- he says in here, broadly speaking, it is my view that the Institute's position on the health charges against tobacco should be that in the present state of scientific evidence these charges are unfounded.

Q,  And what was the industry's position on labeling at that time, if you could read Number 7.

A. Do you want me to read the -* the number or just the -- what the suggestion would be or the w^iole thing?

Q.  You can read the number and the answer.

A.  Okay.  What is the Institute's position on such specific matters as labeling contents of cigarettes, putting on warning labels, adding punitive taxes to discourage consumption?

Matters such as labeling contents of cigarettes, putting on warning labels, adding punitive taxes to discourage consumption all arise out of the charges that tobacco is a health hazard. Th Institute's position on all such matters should be that it has not been proved that tobacco is a health hazard; that it  that its use is a universal pleasure and relaxation; that many hundreds of thousands of people depend on it for their livelihood; and that any step in the direction of discouraging the consumption of tobacco is unjustified and harmful.

Q.  Okay.  Now, remember we talked about the

Prank Statement earlier where they said that the ~ the -- it was -- people's health was a basic responsibility and paramount to every other consideration of our business; do you remember that?

A.  I do.

Q.  And so in this letter from Mr. Hahn to Mr. Hill where he's discussing the objectives of the Tobacco Institute, where in that letter does he tfrlk about saving lives and health of the smokers being paramount?

A.  I don't believe that that necessarily is discussed.

Q.  And when he's talking about  in the letter when he's talking about many hundreds of thousands of people depend on it for their livelihood, where does he discuss the hundreds of thousands of people that were getting sick and d^ing?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  Again, at that time the --in 1958 the industry would not have believed that that was the case  Thev believed that there was -- potentially there was an association, but that question w&s not ***** boon

A.  That is what's listed.

Q.  And on the next page it says from our contaots in the U.S.A. and Canada, we sought information on the extent to which it is accepted that cigarette smoke "causes" lung cancer; do you sjee that?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  And under -- and if you go down to the "causation" of lung cancer, if you could read that first sentence into the record, please.

A.  With one exception (H.S.N. Greene) the individuals whom we met believe that smoking causes lung cancer if by "causation" we mean any chain of vents which leads finally to lung oanoer and which involves smoking as an indispensable link.

Q.  Did the TI, TIRC or CTR publicly make a statement in 1958 that they believed there was an indispensable link between smoking and lung cancer?

A.  Not -- not to my knowledge, no.

Q. And if you could go to the next page and road the first sentence into the record, please.

Q. And they did not join with R. J. Reynolds ahd Brown & Williamson and American Tobaooo and Philip Morris with the TIRC originally, correct?

A.  Liggett 6 Myers stayed out of the TIRC originally because they doubted the sincerity of TtlRC motives and believed that the organization was tbo unwieldy to work efficiently.  They remained convinced that their misgivings were justified.

A.  Were they not or were they? What -- what was your question?

Q.  Are you aware of the fact that that's what the TIRC was doing, they were funding projects not directly related to smoking and lung cancer?

A.  Research to date has not established whether smoking is or is not causally involved in such diseases as lung cancer and heart disease --disease despite efforts to make it seem otherwise. The matter remains an open question for resolution by scientists.

Q.  So, they wanted  they were telling the public that there was a controversy, oorreot? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't think he said controversy. He says it's under investigation and indeed in 1963 that was -- or in '65 there were still Questions. BY MR. PAIGE: Q. Well, in '65 that was after the Surgeon General report of '64, correct? A.  It is, yes.

Q. And so, were there any efforts -- are you atrare of efforts by the tobaooo industry, the TI, TlRC, CTR, R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, American Tobacco to create an atmosphere of doubt ahd confusion and controversy for smokers?

potential links were for the association that was seen in epidemiology in the '60s, and there was a lot of effort going on to look at tobaooo smoke and understand it and remove -- or reduce toxicants in smoke or tobacco.

Q.  So you're not aware  you haven't -- in the documents that you've read and as the person from R. J. Reynolds with the most knowledge you're unaware of any campaign to create doubt or cjonfusion, correct?

A.  I -- I wouldn't agree that that was the purpose.  Certainly the ~~ the industry had their positions.  They be  they had certain beliefs abound what the science suggested to them, and they  they did make those beliefs known through the Tobaooo Institute.

Q.  Do you see how -~ do you see how their positions could have oreated an atmosphere of doubt ahd confusion?

it is, Dr. Figlar has not reviewed any of the documents that we contend there is a privilege on, and I'll instruct him not to answer questions about a privileged document.  So let me just check.

MR. PAIGE:  This is a document that's been admitted in every single trial that I've been involved with, so if you're going to instruct him not to answer, we're going to seek fees ahd costs if we have to come back.

MR. LATHAM:  I understand.  Let me just check the document.

MR. PAIGE:  Obviously we gave you these documents for the record 30 days in advance. If there was a privilege objection, there was sufficient time to let us know to bring it to the attention of the court.

MR. LATHAM:  Yes, we're going to maintain an attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection of this document.  It's a Bliley document, and that's PT2027, Exhibit Number, I think 7, to the deposition.  7 -- or is it 8?

MR. PAIGE:  Okay,  Well, I'm going to ask my questions, and if you instruct him not to

answer, you know, you can do so.  It's our position that we're going to ask him to be flown in to the trial to answer these questions while this is going on, but I'll ask them now, and if you instruct him not to answer, that's fine.

Q.  1966, okay?

A.  I'm sorry.

Q.  Now if you'll assume also, although he wouldn't allow you to talk about it, I want you to assume that in that document from October 20th, 1966, there is a statement where they're talking about the key word is confusion.  Anything we can do to confirm such a situation could work to our advantage provided  and then B says the significance of tar and nicotine per se is seriously questioned in terms of scientific indictment and established ranges of hazard, okay? I want you to assume that that's in this internal mbmo that you and I have not yet talked about but w|a will, I believe, okay?

Q.  So my question to you is on the very next d*y, October 21st, 1966, there is a press release which is Exhibit 9, PT02545; do you see that?

A.  1 do.  I have it in front of me.

Q.  And if you could read the -- the  the ~~ read the first several paragraphs of that one, two, thro, four, five short paragraphs or really sentences if you could read that into the record.

A.  The Tobacco Institute today issued the following statement in response to inquiries

concerning a forthcoming magazine artiole, and

i

earlier published reports on the subject of "tar" and nicotine:  The increased [sic] attention in recent weeks to the subject of "tar" and nicotine appears to reflect a considerable amount of misunderstanding and confusion about this subject. While some scientists believe that "tar" and nicotine are harmful, other scientists do not a^. Wo know of no valid soiontifio ovid.nco demonstrating that either "tar" or niootine is responsible for any human illness. Even those who maintain that smoking is harmful have not been able t|o establish that any particular ingredient in tpbacco smoke causes human disease.  With respect tjo nicotine -""

Q.  That's fine.  Dr. Figlar, if you can go to the last page and read the last two paragraphs.

A.  Nor is there any scientific proof today that "tar" and nicotine has significance in terms of human health.  Scientists throughout the world are continuing to investigate to learn the full fkots about "tar" and nicotine, and about questions concerning tobacco and health.  The tobacco industry is supporting much of this research and will continue to do so.

Q.  And is that -- those statements that you wanted or that the Tobaooo Institute wanted the public to believe?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I would think so.  I mean, this was the position of the industry at that time.

BY MR  PAIGE *

Q.  That there was no proof that tar and nicotine has significance in terms of human health, correct?

A.  That certainly was the belief at that time, and I think we would all agree today that nicotine is not particularly harmful.

Q.  Well, nicotine causes addiction, correct?

A.  It is addictive, yes.

Q. And for some people it's highly addictive, obrreot?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I mean, I don't know how you  I don't know how you grade that or not, but it's certainly  it can be addictive, yes. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Well, the Surgeon General has established a link between nicotine addiction and lung cancer, have they not? You're familiar with that, aren't

yJ0U?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I am familiar with  with what the Surgeon General has said. Niootine in and of itself, while addictive, is not harmful. BY MR. PAIGE: 0.  Okay. And tar is very harmful, is it not; it's a carcinogen?

A.  Tar can certainly  we certainly believe that the toxicants and carcinogens in tar would be the -- where you could make a causal link today. Q.  Between smoking and lung cancer? A.  I would think so, yeah. Q,  And that's not what you wore tolling the

publio though in that press release, was it? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Well, that's not what was believed in 1966, so no. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Okay.  And so if you didn't believe it, it wbuld be reasonable for the public not to believe ijb, correct?

MR. LATHAM;  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I think it's possible the pub -- people in the publio could have that view, yes.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  And if you did believe it, but were saying otherwise and lying, that would be wrong? MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  It would. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  That would be misleading?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Are you asking me in general terms or are we talking in time frame?  I mean, I agree with that statement, it would be wrong. But you are asking me  if you're -- if you're -- if you're asking me whether or not the companies believed or anybody else believed that nicotine was. addictive in 1966, then that's a different kind of question. BY MR. PAIGE: q.  My  my question is this:  In 1966 if RL J. Reynolds knew that their cigarettes caused ljing cancer, but were lying about it, you know that would be the wrong thing to do, don't you? A.  I would agree with that, yes.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Dr. Figlar, are you aware of certain pjiblic relations programs that the TI, Tobacco Institute, and the tobacco industry would get involved with to reestablish a cigarette controversy?

A.  I'm aware of certain publio relations efforts from TI.  I'm not sure about controversy side, but certainly I'm aware of PR efforts,

Q.  Do you know what Tiderock Corporation is? A.  I believe I do.

A.  I do.

Q.  And if you could read into the record to tfiis end  if you could read that to this end and Number 1, please.

A.  It says, to this end, The Tiderook Corporation believes the industry should pursue a program that, one, re-establishes the "cigarette controversy".  There are two facets to this approach.  Set the record straight in terms of medical facts. B, the propaganda approach in terms okr, quote, big brother.

Q.  And Number 2?

A.  2, proves the conscience and concern of tfie industry -- makes it clear that the tobacco industry is going to lead the crusade in finding ojit the true facts.

Q.  Okay. Why was it important to reestablish the "cigarette controversy"?

A.  I don't necessarily know why it would be important to re-establish the  the "cigarette controversy".

I think what Tiderock is suggesting, whether or not TI wanted a controversy or not is  I'm not sure, what Tiderock suggested is they need to set the record straight in terms of what the medical facts are.  So I think their view was that not everything was being publicized in terms of what actual medical facts were available.  So they wanted to "Bv tnax*   biinv Svraignx*.

Q.    And they wanted the public to believe that the tobacco industry was going to lead the crusade in finding out the true facts, correct? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  That is what's stated here. BY MR. PAIGE:

Q.     And that Tobacco Institute actually did hire The Tiderock Corporation in this effort, did tney not?

Q.  And so who's --okay. And then the next -- the next paragraph, please.

A. We will receive a copy of the outline.  If it is unfavorable, we can exert sufficient influence to change the "tone" before the final article.

Q.  Okay.  So who is -- who is Stanley Frank, by the way?

6            THE WITNESS:  Well, I suspect that if you

7       don't like the tone you might want to suggest

8       other facts that might be in play that could

9       change the tone.

10            BY MR. PAIGE:

11        Q,  Okay.

12        A.  I mean, if you don't like the direction of

13   a certain -- the way something is written, if you

14   c^n influence otherwise, then that would be what

15   the suggestion was here.

16        Q.  But don't you remember the Frank Statement

17   aain where you talked about the public health

18   being paramount to the industry?

19        A.  I do, yes.

20        Q.    And don't you remember you told me that

Q.  And so if that's the case, why would they be concerned if the artiole or outline is unfavorable to the industry that they would want to exoerpt sufficient influence to change the tone of the article?

A.  If your objective is to try to get your pbint of view out which you believe to be the truth ajid you think you can influence the tone to try to got those facts out, then that's what they were suggesting to do.

Q.  Did they tell the publio that the Stanley Fjcank article was being reviewed by the industry to influence the tone?

A.  Not that I'm aware of.

Q.  Did they tell anybody in the publio who they were mailing this artiole to that they were involved with providing proper guidance to the writer?

A.  I don't know if they did provide proper guidance or not, but I'm not aware that they would h^ve informed people that they did.

Q.  Did they  when  when the article was published was it portrayed as being an independent ahd unbiased artiole?

A.  I read the artiole.  I don't  I don't

2   story entitled "To Smoke Or Not to Smoke - That Is

3   Still The Question."

4            "At the moment we can all say for sure 

5   sorry.  "At the moment, all we can say for sure is

6   that the cause of cancer is not known and that

7   there is absolutely no proof that smoking causes

8   hjaman cancer."

9            "Statistics alone link cigarettes 

10   statistics alone link cigarette with lung cancer, a

11   correlation that is not accepted as scientific

12   proof of cause and effect."

13            "Long exposure to concentrated cigarette

14   smoke never has produoed lung cancer in

15   experimental animals  and researchers have been

16   trying for 35 years."

17        Q.  Doctor, you went a little bit further than

18   I; I wanted, but -~

19        A.  I  I'm sorry.

20        Q.  -- the first part where  that's okay.

21   Ih the first part where -- where you were saying

22   that there was absolutely no prove that smoking

23   causes human cancer; do you remember reading that?

24        A.  I do.

A.  Maybe Doctor Strickman's new filter will solve the health problems [sic], if it exists, for America's 70 million smokers. Maybe not. At the moment, all we can say for sure is that the cause of cancer is not known and that there's absolutely no proof that smoking causes human cancer.

Q. And that was the artiole that was -~ the statements in the artiole that was proofread by the tobacco industry before it was published, oorreot? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS;  I don't know that we know whether or not it was  it was proofread.  We know that the outline was supposed to be looked at by TI.  I don't know if the artiole in and of itself was.

Doctor, before we do that -- the next press release.  Isn't it true, Doctor, that the  I'm sorry.  You oan go ahead -- I'm sorry, strike that.

A.  It says, New York, New York, the American Cancer Society today issued a detailed refutation of a Tobacco Institute promotion claiming that "there is absolutely no proof that smoking causes human cancer." In its statement the Society congratulated The Wall Street Journal for exposing, quote, the real source, end quote, of, quote, a devious mailing to tens of thousands of physicians, lawyers, schoolteachers and many others.  The expensive mailing is a reprint of an artiole that appeared originally in True Magazine and is entitled "To Smoke Or Not to Smoke - That is Still the Question." The author is Stanley Frank, recently employed by Hill & Knowlton, one of the publio relations firms for the Tobacco Institute.

In the mass mailing to physicians, teachers and others there is no reference to the cigarette industry role in the entire project.

Q.     So the  the involvement of Stanley Frank to the tobaooo industry was revealed, not by the tobacco industry, but by The Wall Street Journal, correct?

A.  That's what this says.

Q.  And then following this press release did

THE WITNESS:  I don't know that the tobaooo industry would say they were trying to mislead the public, but I don't know whether or not they issued an apology or that their name was not mentioned or not. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Okay.  So as you sit here today as the corporate representative for R. J. Reynolds, you don't believe that this True Magazine artiole was misleading; is that what you're telling us?

THE WITNESS:  Correct, I don't believe that the information in there was misleading. I think it represented the -- certainly represented the many points that -~ that the tobacco industry had. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  You don't believe it was just a massive propaganda effort?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know that an artiole in True Magazine would be -- would constitute a propaganda effort necessarily.

BY MR. PAIGE:

Q.  Okay.  Can you read -- can you read the second to last paragraph, please.

A.  "What is presented as a mailing to community leaders by the owners of True is now exposed as a massive propaganda effort by the tobacco industry."

Q.     In the artiole, did  I know we talked about you don't know who received funding and who didn't receive funding -- was it ever disclosed that the people who were saying smoking didn't cause cancer or wasn't proven that they cause cancer represented a minority, extremely small minority, of the scientists at that time?

A.  In 1968?

Q.  Yes.

A.  I don't know if it was necessarily a small minority.  It was a minotity I think at that time.

Q.  Okay.  Can you read the last paragraph.

A.  Mr. Frank names a small number of individuals in science and medicine who claim that the case against cigarettes is unproved, but the Cancer Society points out that "by doing so, he gives the impression that the scientific community is seriously divided in judgment."

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424                                    www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Mr. Frank fails to note, according to the ACS, that his "sources" constitute a minority --and an extremely small minority, at that -- among those who have considered the question.  The Society cites the "host" of organizations, both hero and abroad, including voluntary as well as government agencies that have "indicated cigarette smoking as a serious health hazard."

Q,  Sir, isn't it true that the tobacco industry through the Tobacco Institute was making misleading statements to the publio in order to promote the sale of cigarettes?

A.  I don't  I don't agree with that, no. (Figlar Exhibit 16, Memo dated 4/15/68 to Earle C. Clements from The Tobaooo Institute, Inc., PT02130, was marked for identification.) BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Okay.  The next exhibit, Exhibit 2130, which is Exhibit 16, if you could turn to that one. Do you see that? A.  I do.

Q. And who is Earle Clements? A.  I'm not sure who Earle Clements is*  I read this  this is a Tobaooo Institute document. I'm not ssuro who Earlo Clements is.

Q.  Okay.  And it's a memo from the desk of William Kloepfer, who is the vice president of PR for the Tobacco Institute, oorreot?

A.  That is oorreot.

Q. And on the baok of it he CCs a host of people, including Blalook, Jim Bowling, Frederick Haas, Addison Yeaman, et cetera, et cetera, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And so you just told me that you didn't believe that the tobaooo company was making statements to ~~ misleading statements to promote the sale of cigarettes, correct?

A.  That is correct.

Q.  Can you read the second para  Number 2 into the record from this memo, please?

A.  It says, our basic position in the cigarette controversy is subjeot to the charge, and may be subject to a finding, that we are making fMlse or misleading statements to promote the sale of cigarettes.

Q.  And that would be highly improper, knowing how deadly oigarettes are and knowing how many youths in our  in our society are smoking, oorreot?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Again, I would say it would be improper.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q,    Why do you think it would be the wrong thing to do to lie and make misleading statements about cigarettes to the publio?

A. Are you asking me why? Are you asking for my opinion?

Q.  Yeah.  I'm asking your opinion, as the corporate representative for R. J. Reynolds, why would it be wrong to mislead the American public in order to promote the sale of oigarettes; do you khow why?

Q.  Yes.

A.  Headlines:  There should be -- these should be very carefully written on the premise that doctors and scientists, like other readers, often grab information from the headlines and nothing more.

THE WITNESS:  Because I think the Tobacco Institute's job was to be an advocate of the industry and they believed, as did others, that not all the information was out in the publio with regard to these issues.  So I think they looked for criteria on what types of articles, because obviously you can't just make up the article  scientific articles.  They were looking to publicise those scientific articles that showed the other side of the story that maybe the Tobacco Institute and the industry didn't feel was getting appropriate air time. So, that was what they were trying to do to try to attract attention to other types of scientific information that was available at that time that maybe people were not hearing. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  But if we can go back to Exhibit 16 then again, which is 2130, where they talked about our basic position in the cigarette controversy is subject to the charge and may be subject to the finding that we are making false statements or misleading statements to promote the sale of ctigarettes; do you remember we spoke about that?

A.  Well, that's what they're suggesting theit

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-^79-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                     212-490-3430

this is what people may say about us, but that doesn't mean that's what it was.

They're actually warning and saying, you khow, they're  people are probably going to come out and say that we're -- we're making stuff up, but that doesn't mean that that's true.

Q.  Well, that's what -- that's what actually happened, actually in the Engel trial you were actually found to have done that, right?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  It's beyond the scope, Gary. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Right?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  You know that.  We have spoken about that before.

A. Look, I'm aware of the findings, but I don't know that the  that the findings from a jury are really the same thing as what is happening ih the scientific community and the serious questions around cause and effect relationships, how that's viewed, how that's determined, shifts in scientific thought.  That is not the same thing. Q.     Well, that sounds pretty complicated the

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424                                    www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

way that you're putting it, Doctor, but the truth is, it wasn't only the Engel jury, but it went all the way up to the Florida Supreme Court and the Engel findings were  were  were actually affirmed, were they not?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form, beyond the scope.

THE WITNESS:  I'm aware of that, but that's  that is, again, a court. That's not the same thing as how science works or how scientific thought changes, and you're  you know, you have to realise where you are in time when these things are written and what people thought at the time that they were written, and I don't think that's fully appreciated. BY MR. PAIGE: Q. Well, so in 1968 when this individual was writing that our position in the controversy may be sjubjeot to the finding that we're making false and misleading statements to promote sale of oigarettes, my question to you is:  If they were, in faot, making false and misleading statements to

typo of conduct from such a big industry? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I don't know because I don't think that would have been the right thing to do, period.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q. Was it money? Were they motivated by

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know what the motivation was.  I haven't seen documents that suggest what -- why they would have that type of motivation.

BY MR. PAIGE: 0*  Well, when they talk about the most important type of story being one that oasts doubt on the cause and effect theory of smoking and disease, why would they want to oast doubt on the causes of lung cancer in smoking when hundreds of thousands of people were dying every year, why would they do such a thing?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  Again, their position was that cause and effect shouldn't have been established.  So it would be important for the Tobacco industry -~ Institute as an advooaoy group fox- the tobacco companies to put forth

that position.

The industry did not believe that cause and effect could be established, that you could change the way cause and effect relationships from a medical perspective should be evaluated.

That's what happened in the 1964 Surgeon General's report.  It's talked about there.  So they didn't agree. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Okay, But remember the Frank Statement that the public health was paramount, remember we sf>oke about that? A.  I do, yes.

Q.  So between 1953 and 1968, do you know how much money the industry was making at the same time knowing how many people were dying; do you know that?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  It's beyond the scope.

THE WITNESS: Do I know that number? I don't.  I haven't researched that.

Q.  The next document, Dr. Figlar, is Exhibit 19, which is PT0719; do you see that?

A.  I have it.

Q,  And, Doctor, you agree  I'm going to go over some press release statements with you in a moment, okay?

A.  Okay.

Q. And you would agree the people making the press release statements on behalf of the Tobaooo Institute and the tobacco industry generally would have more knowledge about smoking and disease than the average smoker; would you agree with that?

A.  I don't know that I can speak for the Tobacco Institute.  I can certainly speak fbr R. J. Reynolds, and I would say the people at R. J. Reynolds would have more knowledge.

Q.  Okay. And when statements were being made tb the public about smoking and disease, it was the djisire of R. J. Reynolds and the industry that the public hear the statements, listen to the information and hopefully they would believe it, r{i.ght?

THE WITNESS:  I think in general, that would be correct.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  And it would be wrong to issue publio statements for the purpose of -- of creating doubt, right?

A.  I think it would be wrong if the  if they did not believe that those statements were real or credible, but I don't know that there's anything wrong with creating doubt if you believe that doubt should be in question.

If there's a  if there's a subject matter that you think there's  there's controversy around or that you think is still being djsbated, then I don't think there's anything wrong with -- with offering other sides of an opinion in an argument.  I don't think there's anything wrong with that.

Q.  Okay.  So, again, you know the Frank Statement, R. J. Reynolds and the Tobacco Institute indicated that the publio health is paramount to all other concerns of their business, right?

2   know --we know that a cigarette -- well, we know

3   back in the '50s and '60s it was being claimed by

4   many eminent scientists that cigarettes were

6   American citizens, oorreot?

7            MR. LATHAM:  Objeot to the form.

8            THE WITNESS:  I know the question was

9       certainly raised in the '50s.  I Would  I

10       would also offer that there's many scientists

11       in that time frame that did not believe that,

12       many in the government, many in the National

13       Cancer Institute.  So yes, there was certainly

14       a debate and a scientific question that was

15       open in the '50s and '60s.

You need to  you need to make sure that the things that you're saying you certainly believe in and believe to be right. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  And you certainly don't want to be issuing statements purely for the purpose of creating doubt or establishing a controversy, oorreot? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

3        Q.  -- in that last paragraph, if you could

9   in the mind of the general public.  It is also the

10   means of establishing a controversy. Within the

15        A.  If it is  if in our pro-cigarette

I know there were scientists that  that didn't neoessarilv Question the association.  They believed that there was an association.

Q. Okay.  So I'm not going to rehash that with you right now.  I think that would be a waste of time. We also know from prior trials you've seen documents, have you not, where R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson have destroyed documents. Have you seen those documents?

there's a cause and effect relationship. That is the point at which the scientists struggled, is the change in --BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Show me --

A.  I'm sorry, but that is  I'm not finished with my answer.  But that is the point that I'm trying to make.  The scientists within Reynolds did net believe that it was appropriate to change the means by which cause and effect relationships should be established, nor could the scientists at Reynolds determine what types of causative agents would be responsible to have that cause and effect relationship.

They oould find toxicants in smoke.  They obuld find carcinogens in smoke, but they oould not find them in sufficient enough quantities to suggest that  that it would cause human disease. There's a distinction in what I'm trying to say bjatween establishing cause and effect relationship, which is what TI was talking about, and what I was talking about in terms of what scientists believed ahd the belief that whether or not something might bo a danger.  I think there's scientists that bblieved it could have> been a danger, certainly.

Q.  Okay.  So where  have you seen any press release or statement from the Tobacco Institute, the CTR or R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson or American Tobaooo where they came forward and they said, there are scientists in our company who believed that smoking oigarettes is dangerous and can cause lung cancer?

A.  I mean, the TI said it oould be a cause. They  they  I mean, they  they've said it on a! number of occasions. You sent video where it s^ys it may be or it may not be. You saw it in  in the True article.  It may be or it may not be. It was a question. They -- they -- they didn't know for sure, and in the absence of definitive proof, many scientists will default to say I don't know because that is -- that is the position that a lot of people would take.  That may net be the same position that the publio health community had taken or that the publio health community should take, but that is the position of many scientists.

Q. Okay. Doctor, you're telling me that people came forward and said, hey, it may be, it may not be,  I get that. We're going to go through those.

I want to know the statement where R. J. Reynolds came forward and said, we have scientists working in our company who believe smoking caused lung cancer, when did you make that statement and where was it made for the first time?

A.  I don't know that that  that they were  that they made that statement in this time frame.  I know that Bowman Gray acknowledged the  the statistical association in '64, and recognized that that was a problem.  I've seen documents from Alan Rodgman saying that, in essence, as an operating premise, we should try to remove carcinogens from oigarettes so that that might be an issue. But I mean, I don't know a public statement per se that that would make that declaration.

Q.  Doctor, when is the first time R. J. Reynolds publicly admitted that smoking causes lung cancer?

A.  In that simple terminology in 2000.

Q.  Prior to 2000 did R. J. Reynolds, the Tobacco Institute, Brown & Williamson or American Tobacco ever issue a statement where they told the public that there were scientists, working in your Ijaboratorios who hold the belief that smoking did

Q. And it was sent for release at 6:30 p.m. Monday, February 3rd, 1963, oorreot?

A.  '69.

Q.  '69*  And oan you read the first two paragraphs into the record, please?

A.  I can.  The  the scientist who has been associated with more research in tobaooo and health than any other person declared today that, quote, there is no demonstrated causal relationship between smoking and any disease.  "The gaps in knowledge are so great that those who dogmatically assert otherwise - whether they state that there is or is not such a causal relationship - are premature in judgment.  If anything, the pure biological evidence is pointing away from, not toward, the causal hypothesis."

Q. And, again, that was a statement that you wanted the public and the consumers to believe, oorreot?

A.  They would, yes.

statement may not necessarily be just to cause doubt for the sake of doing that.  That may -- but having a controversy or maybe people doubting the other side of the argument may very well be a consequence.

Q. Was that a desired consequence?

A.  I think the desired consequence was to get this message out.

Q. And the message being that there's no proof that smoking causes lung cancer?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, that's not exactly what he said, but in essence, similar, yes. BY MR. PAIGE:

Q.     Okay.  And so you -- you indicated before that there were people from the American Cancer Society and other public health organisations who were researching and were believing that smoking caused lung cancer; do you remember that?

A.  I believe that there  that there were. There were certainly people from the American Cancer Society, but there were also people from National Cancer Institute that felt that the causal relationship was not established.

Q.  All right.  We're going to talk about that

in a moment, but there were people in the public health community who were putting out the message that smoking causes lung cancer in the '50s and '60s, oorreot?

A.  I think in the '50s that that would  there were those that thought that.  I don't  I don't know that too many went that far because of what needed to be established in order to determine that.  In '64 that changed, but there were people that I think certainly believed that that was the case and were researching to try to generate enough proof to prove that.

Q.  When do you believe there was a scientific cbnsensus that smoking caused lung cancer?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  Beyond the scope.

THE WITNESS:  I don't know, but my -- I mean, I don't know if I oould put a definitive date on it.  I think certainly by the --by the late '60s and early '70s that there was a majority view that smoking caused disease or at least was haeardous.  So I think certainly by the  by the '70s I would say probably most or a majority of scientists believed that would be true.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Well, you know there's a difference between the word most and majority.  Majority is more than 50 percent and most is almost everybody. So by the 1960s and 1970s do you think it was roost scientists or do you think it was just majority? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  Beyond the scope.

THE WITNESS:  I mean, I've never really looked for numbers to evaluate how many.  I would say a majority of people by the '70s, scientists by the '70s, believed it was at least hazardous, if not a cause and effect relationship was established, BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Okay.  And as a product cigarette manufacturer do you agree, especially when you're saying the publio health is a paramount concern, that you should know at least as much about your product as people who are not manufacturing your product?

making a -- a deadly product where the publio health is paramount, you would agree with me that your knowledge should be greater than other sources about whether or not your product causes lung cancer?

MR. LATHAM:  Objeot to the form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know about that per se because that's a different question than what the produot is, okay? I mean, I think the -- the manufacturers would know what's in their product.  They would know what is generated when the product is burned, but there's a difference between knowing that and basically changing the basis by which oause and effect of disease relationships are judged. That I don't know whether or not the industry would be expert at. They would certainly have opinions on it.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q. Did R. J. Reynolds recognise and understand that it was risky to be smoking cigarettes in the '50s and '60s and '70s?

between the statistical data and smoking.  So I think that's probably a recognition of certainly the possibility that it existed.

I've certainly seen scientific documents in Reynolds that we have gone over before that wbuld suggest that it would be appropriate to remove, if you can, certain toxicants in smoke.  So they certainly recognised that the possibility existed.

MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  I move to strike that. I don't think that was my question.  Let me rephrase it.

THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  I want to know when did R. J. Reynolds  when did R. J. Reynolds first appreciate, understand that if somebody smoked your product there were real significant risks that they oould get sick and die?

recognition then.  Again, I think if  if I was to  if I was to say that the definition of understanding whether or not there was a possibility, then I would say at least going back to the '50s because they recognised that there were toxicants and carcinogens in smoke so there could be at least a possibility.  So it's a difficult  I'm sorry I'm rambling on about  with regard to your question, but I'm trying to do the best I oan with that. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Okay.  I don't think you answered it, so I'll move to strike again, but let's move on and  and just go through these documents. A.  Okay.

Q.  That might be the easier way to do it with you.

The next exhibit is Exhibit 5504-283, which is Exhibit 20; do you have that? A.  I do.

Q. And can you read the first paragraph.

A.  Sure.  It says, the Tobacco Institute declared today that the American Cancer Society is withholding significant data from scientific scrutiny in connection with an experiment which the Society claimed resulted in production of lung cancer in dogs with cigarette smoke.

Q.  So the American lung cancer  the American Cancer Society was saying smoking causes lung cancer and they were citing to an experiment wj.th dogs to -- to support that theory, oorreot?

A.  In essence, yes, they had suggested --actually the ACS had had a press conference to ahnounce the study and the results of the study, but they did not release the data.

Q.  Okay.

A.  The scientific data that would support the conclusion in the press release.

Q.  Right.  And you wanted the American publio tb believe the Tobacco Institute, the tobacco industry, over the American Cancer Society, ebrreot?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Well, there's really nothing to bcliev othor than what's in the statement.

The American Cancer -- they're saying that the ACS did not -- is withholding the data from scientific scrutiny, and they did.  The data was not turned over.  So it's not a matter of belief.  It's a statement of, I believe, fact in this oase.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  When did the tobacco companies first publicly provide their data or their public documents to the publio? When were your internal documents first made publio?

MR. LATHAM:  Objeotion to form.  Beyond the scope.

THE WITNESS:  Well, I mean, it depends on what internal documents.  I mean, there's been -- there's plenty of oases where scientific data that R. J. Reynolds would have collected went into the publio domain in the form of peer-reviewed articles. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Sir, you're not answering my question.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q. Do you know when the tobaooo companies f^rst -- first put forward to the publio their secret confidential internal documents?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.  Beyond the scope.

THE WITNESS:  I don't know that they would turn over secret or confidential documents necessarily, but that's not what this is that you're making reference to, with this ACS data. (Figlar Exhibit 21, Press Release from The Tobacco Institute titled The Tobacco Institute Believes the American Public is Entitled to Complete, Authenticated Information About Cigarette Smoking and Health.  The American Cancer Society Does Not Seem to Agree, PT06001, was marked for identification.) BY MR. PAIGE: 0.  The next document is Exhibit  I'll go to Exhibit -- hold on.  It's Exhibit 16 - Exhibit 16. No, not Exhibit 16.  It's Exhibit 21, PT06001. Do you have that? A.  Oh, I'm sorry,  6001?

MR. LATHAM:  Wait a second.  Okay.

THE WITNESS:  Yes.

BY MR. PAIGE:

Q.  And what is that dooument?

A.  It looks again like a press release from

tjie Tobacco Institute.

Q.  And  hold on.  What is  can you tell

me the date of it, Doctor?

A.  It doesn't have a date, but the title is

Tfie Tobacco Institute Believes the American Publio

is Entitled to Complete, Authenticated Information

i About Cigarette Smoking and Health.  The American

THE WITNESS:  Hold on.  Yep. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Okay. What is that dooument? A.  This is another Tobacco Institute document.

Q.  Okay.  That was -- it's not a document. It was a newspaper ad taken out by the Tobacco Institute in December of 1970, correct?

A.  That is correct.  It is  says on it it's

newspapers, December 1st, 1970.

Q. And, again, that is a part of the propaganda from the Tobacco Institute to help shape public knowledge and publio opinions?

A.  I mean, the -- the -- I don't know that I I'd call it propaganda, but it's certainly from the Tbbaoco Institute.  It's an advocacy piece putting forth their issues.

Q.  And can you read the headline, please.

A.  After millions of dollars and over 20 years of research the question about smoking and health is still a question.

Q. And the seoond paragraph, can you read that, please.

A.  It says result.  So far, in spite of this

A.  I'm sorry? I'm sorry?

Q,  You -- you just said  you said today we dcm't even know the exact mechanism; do you remember saying that?

A.  We don't know the exact mechanism, no, but I mean, we're certainly further along than we were in 1970.

Q.  I'm just asking if you remember  I'm asking if you remember saying that, because that's not what the artiole says, is it? They're talking about something different, aren't they?

A. No. You asked me 

Q.  The artiole -- Doctor, the artiole says  the artiole says there are eminent scientists who question whether there is any causal relationship has been proved between cigarette smoking and human disease, right?

A.  Right.  And so when you asked me the question as to why

A.  Yes.  Sure.

9    then, it's 1807, which is Exhibit 23.

10              Do you have it?

11          A.  I do.  Is this --

12          Q. And this is a memo from Cullman to Wakeham

13    [jsic], correct?

14          A.  It is.

15          Q.  And they're discussing in this meeting --

16    in this memo a November 30th meeting with the CTR

17    executive committee, oorreot?

18          A.  That is oorreot.

19          Q.  And they're talking about the -- the --

20    t^e stated objective or purpose of the CTR,

21    correct, in this memo?

22          A.  That is a  that is a heading, yes.

23          Q.  And so if we could go through it and read,

Did I -- do you see that?

A.     That's  in the first paragraph from the t*>p?

Q.  Yeah, second sentence it says --

A.  That's right.

0*  ~~ the question, what kind of CTR program is best for the industry; do you see that?

A.  It says, it might be appropriate to comment on the question, quote, what kind of CTR program is best for the industry.

Q. Okay. Can you read the rest of that paragraph into the record?

A.  It says, at the meeting it was apparent this question is troubling many elements of the industry to the extent people are reluctant to

djtscuss the subject openly because of the diversity

i

ojf views.  To some extent this unsettled state also exists within Philip Morris.  In the hopes of clarifying, at least partially, the matter I offer tjie following summary, hastily adding that these

Q. Okay. And then it goes on to say the stated objective or purpose of CTR; do you see tfiat?

A  I do.

0. Okay. And so they're saying what is  what is the purpose that we're stating  that we're telling people of CTR is, and can you read that first sentence of what the stated purpose is?

A.  It says "to aid and assist research into tobaoco use and health and to make available to the public factual information on the subject."

Q.  So that's the stated purpose, that they're telling the public of what the CTR is supposed to do, correct?

A. Well, I mean, it's both, isn't it? It says, stated objective or purpose of the CTR.

Q.  Okay. And then if you oould read the last sentence of that Number 1 heading, in any oase?

A. In any oase, this statement of purpose does not reveal the -- the objective need of the industry in supporting the CTR program.

Q. And if you can go on and read the first four sentences of the next paragraph.

A. Two, it has been stated that CTR is a program to find out "the truth about smoking and health." What is  what is the truth to one is false to another. CTR and the industry have publicly and frequently denied what others find as

"truth."  Let's faoe it.

Q. Okay.  Let's face it and the next paragraph -- I mean, sentence.

A. We are interested in evidence which we believe denies the allegation that cigarette sftoking causes disease.

Q.  Okay.  So where in that -- in that statement where they're talking about the objective ahd purpose of CTR, and they're discussing we are interested in evidence we believe denies the allegation that cigarette smoking causes disease, where in there do they discuss that the publio health is still a paramount concern of theirs? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't necessarily see that statement in there. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Okay. And then it goes on on Option B, they're talking about things of what they can use the CTR for, oorreot?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  Yes, on the next page, I see Option B.

Q.     What is Option B, what arc  if you can

read that first paragraph and tell the jury what they're talking about.

A.  It says, Option B, use the CTR program as a means of establishing expert scientific witnesses who will testify on behalf of the industry and legislative halls, in litigations, at scientific meetings, and before the press and the publio.

Q.  Okay.  But you just told me previously or you told the jury that the stated -- stated objective was to aid and assist research in tobacco ahd health, correct?

A.  That was what was disoussed here, but of course, this is a memo, which is talking about a meeting as to what we should do with the CTR.

0.  Right,

A.  So this is not  this is not  I'm sbrry.  I'm not finished with my answer, but having read this document, I don't  I don't read this as being a directive in terms of what the CTR is doing.  It's talking about a meeting proposing certain aspects of what the CTR could do as opposed tb saying it's a manifesto of what it actually is ahd what it's doing.

Q.     Right.  So one of the things they're purporting to do is not -- they're not talking

about assisting with research, but they're talking about establishing expert witnesses who will support the industry, oorreot?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  This is what Wakeman [sic] is suggesting was discussed at the meeting, that maybe this is something that the CTR should do.  That doesn't necessarily mean that's what they were all about.  That's all I was trying to point out. BY MR. PAIGE: Q. Wakeham  Wakeham was at the meeting, correct, with the CTR, oorreot?

A.  I think he said he was at the meeting, yfrs.

Q.  Okay.  And he's reiterating in this memo what took place at the meeting with the CTR, correct?

A.  He was trying to sum up, as we read in the first paragraph, what kind of ideas were thrown around.  Remember, he said  --

Q.  And they were talking 

A.   I offer hastily these statements embody many ideas from many places.

A.  That's what they were saying in Option B there; that is correct.

Q. And in the second paragraph, if you could r^ad the last sentence, please.

A. One  one might also question how long it would take for the witnesses to acquire the "taint" of industry money.

Q.  Do you know what that means?

A.  I think I can  I think I oan understand in*, yean.

Q. What does that mean?

A. Well, I mean, I think it  it means the same for anybody.  So if you're -~ certainly if you're being paid by the industry, then there's always the question of whether or not you're just solely acting in their interest.

I mean, it's the same thing that you guys mtist face with your expert witnesses, the same reason why you ask me questions about* where I'm getting paid.  So anybody who is paid to be a spokesman, I think, will have that question asked of them.  So, I mean, just like with your witnesses ajnd the same here, I would think.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q.    And if you could read the first par -- the first sentence in the conclusion of this document then.

A.  The first sentence says, it would seem appropriate to explore in some depth during the next year or two how CTR is or might be serving the needs of the cigarette industry.

THE WITNESS:  In the original stated purpose, no, but I guess, you know, they're asking that question now, so maybe it never was properly serving the tobacco industry's needs. I mean, that's what that might suggest, mightn't it?

BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  So now they want to use the CTR to -~ to serve the tobacco needs as opposed to the publio health interests, oorreot?

existence is actually benefiting the industry. That's what that says. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Right, whether  right.  They've got to l^ok at whether or not the CTR is actually giving a benefit to the industry as opposed to the people who are dying?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS: Well, I don't -- I don't think they mention anybody who's dying.  They simply say whether or not it's meeting the needs of the industry. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Exactly.  That's the point in the whole memo which talks about the meeting; they don't talk about -- there's no mention about an interest in helping people who might be dying, is there? MR. LATHAM:  Objection, form. THE WITNESS:  Not that I saw, but they're certainly talking about with more research there's a good chance that smoker-related diseases will be found to result from causes other than smoking and the industry is off the hook.  That was in Option A in Rationale Number 2.  So

BY MR. PAIGE:

Q,  Right.  They wanted the industry  they wanted the industry to get off the hook?

A. Well, I mean, I think they -- they  they felt  they said off the hook, yeah, but, I mean, they're aotually saying that there's probably, if there's more research, that they might find other ottusoB to smoking [sic], so they certainly are issuing forth the idea that they don't believe cigarette smoking is related to that, at least at that time.

Q.  Sir, most respectfully, do you know what percentage of lung cancers are caused from smoking?

A.  Do I know today? I think so.  I think it's over 90 percent.

Q. Exactly.  So if we were to look today for other causes we oould find other causes, couldn't we?

A.  There are other causes, yes.

Q. Right.  So if I wanted to publish other causes, I could do that today if I wanted to, right?

MR. LATHAM;  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  I mean, I suppose you oould, yes.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Right,  So the tobacco industry was using the CTR to look for other causes instead of looking to establish the relationship between smoking and Hing cancer, right?

MR. LATHAM: Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  I think they I think the way I read that sentence was that there were --there would be other causes other than smoking that would be the cause. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Right.

A.  So, in other words, they were saying that they don't necessarily believe that smoking would be the cause of certain diseases.

Q,  Right.  Because they wanted to be off the hook and they wanted to have the needs of the cigarette industry served, correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, certainly, Wakeman  or Wakeham didn't think that perhaps that the CTR was serving the needs of the industry or certainly wanted to look into it.

Q.  Right. And the message that you're putting forth the tobaooo industry can choose to put forth a message to help people, oorreot? MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  They oan put forth their position that they think is appropriate. BY MR. PAIGE:

Q.  Right, but they oould put forth  they hkve an opportunity in these press releases to put forth a message to help consumers, can't they, if they wanted to, if they chose to?

A.  I would think so, yeah.

0. Okay.  So then we can go to the second p^ige of this press release, and if you oould read the second and third paragraph into the record, please.

A.  Kornegay said that what he called "hysteria" about smoking "results from the tenacity of the cancer mystery, whioh is a challenge to the entire nation."  He said that "many eminent scientists who arc workers in the field agree that

the question of smoking and health is still very much a question.  And so apparently do  and so apparently do millions of Americans who continue to omoko despite an almost incessant campaign of fear and exhortation."

Q. And that's what the tobacco industry wanted, they wanted millions of Americans to continue to smoke and believe that there was still an open question, didn't you?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form.

THE WITNESS:  I think the tobacco industry believed that it was an open question, so they certainly wanted that view out there,

BY MR. PAIGE: Q. Right. And they wanted  well, it says here many scientists, many eminent scientists or workers in the field agree that the question of smoking and health is still very much a question. Ahd so apparently do millions of Americans who continue to smoke, and that's what you wanted, isn't it? That's what R. J. Reynolds wanted, that's what the TIRC wanted, the TI, the CTR, they wanted Americans to think that it was still a question and to continue to smoke, didn't you?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to form.

THE WITNESS:  The industry's position at that time is that it was still an open question, that their -- that a cause and effect relationship was not appropriate. That was their message.  You're reading from their press release.  So the statements that they wanted are in the press release. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Right.  Right.  But you  when you put forth a press release  I guess my simple question is this. We can do it the long way. Obviously you're putting forth press releases that you want the American publio to think are honest statements, right?

A. Of course, yes.

Q. And obviously you're putting forth press releases that you want people to believe are true statements, right?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  I would think so, yes. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  And you're putting forward publio  you're putting forth press releases of statements that you want people to believe are true, believe yp>u and rely upon thorn as true faots, don't you?

A.  I would  I would think that they would. I mean, I would think that when you put out a press release that, you know, people have the chance to rely on that as well as a lot of other information that's available.  They certainly want it to be in the consideration set.

Q.  Sure. They wanted  they wanted, as they seid in this press release, they wanted there to be an open question which millions of Americans still believe in and have those millions of Americans still smoking, right?

A.  They didn't --

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS: They didn't want an open question.  That's not what they said.  They said it was a question.  In other words, that there were still a question out there, and that scientists were not in full agreement, and oertainly their scientists were not in full agreement.  They didn't want the question. They said there was a question. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Right.  There was a question.  It wasn't yet established that smoking caused lung cancer is what thd message was that you wore relaying to your

A.  For many scientists, that is correct, that'8 what they said, and they stated that.

Q.    Okay. Okay. And in the next exhibit, which is Exhibit 25, which is PT05504-249, that was from February  that's a press release from February 26th, 1972, correct?

A,  This is the one I was looking at before. I don't know that I see  I see '72 in reference. But I don't know if that's -- I don't know if the press release was from --

Q. Well, it's a February 26th press release where they're talking about here today?

A.  Yep.

A.  Yep.

A.  You got it.  That's correct.

Q.    Can you read the first paragraph of that press release into the record?

A.  I can.  It says, Little Rook --J.C.B. Ehringhaus, Jr., vioe president and counsel fpr the Washington-based Tobacco Institute, said here today that the 1972 report of the Surgeon General to Congress on smoking and health, quote,

	that the, quote, number one health problem is not

MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  Can I get the form

objection, what that was?

MR. LATHAM;  You have to read back the question.  I forgot.

(The following question was read back:

Q:  And yet you're aoousing the Surgeon General and the publio health officials of doing it, not the tobacco industry, right?

MR. LATHAM:  Yes.  It's argumentative and it misstates the dooument.

MR. PAIGE: All right.  Are you saying that I said you instead of the Tobaooo Institute, because I can rephrase it on that --on that purpose or is that not the issue?

MR. LATHAM:  I think the issue is with the word accusing.  That's not in -~ that's not in here.  I think that by using that word you create an argumentative question.

issuing press releases like these, that you would  that you or the tobacco industry  when I sey you I mean the tobacco industry -- would be creating doubt in the minds of smokers as to whether smoking did, in fact, cause cancer?

A.  I don't know if there  if they would necessarily be creating doubt, but I mean that is a possible consequence. They're certainly bringing up the point that there's another side to the story that the Tobaooo Institute and the industry didn't feel was getting appropriate air time which is why they released these press releases.

Q.  But wasn't creating doubt not just a consequence, but an actual strategy of the tobacco ihdustry?

A.  I don't know that it necessarily was.  I know we're looking at documents earlier.that make those kind of statements, but I don't know that  I don't know that that was neoessary based on scientifically what was occurring.

A.  Almost*

Q.  And it's talking about how they defended themselves in  in court rooms, in Congress, legislative halls and in the public opinion, correct?

Q. And can you read the next paragraph with the first  the first indent there, with that next paragraph?

A.  It says  I'm sorry.  Do you -- while the strategy, is that what you're asking me, starting with while the strategy?

A.  Okay.  It says, while the strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed over the years helping us win important battles, it is only fair tb say that it is not - nor was it intended to be ~ a vehicle for victory.  On the contrary, it has always been a holding strategy, consisting of creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it.

Q.  Okay.  So do you agree, Dr. Figlar, that t^at would have been wrong for 20 years to have a hblding strategy to create doubt about the health charges knowing that consumers are dying? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITHESS:  Well, I don't -- I don't know that I agree with that statement.  I don't think I agree with -- with what this characterization of the strategy is, but in essence, I wouldn't agree that that would be the right thing to do, no. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Okay.  Because you weren't -- you weren't ait all the meetings back in the '60s and '70s, but Horace Kornegay was, right?

Penzer wrote suggesting a proposal for a variety of actions, and not necessarily that is  that is a group of meetings that have took place over the course of 20 years.  I don't know if Fred Panzer was around for 20 years or not when he wrote this memo, so I  that's all I was trying to say.  It is a memo.  It exists.  I understand it.  I've read it before.

Q.  Have you seen a memo from Horace Kornegay or William Kloepfer where they wrote back to Panzer and said, what the heck are you talking about? Where did you come up with that from?

A.  No, not that -- not that I've seen.  But I -~ what I do know  what I recall about seeing this memo before is I don't think this constitutional hypothesis or multifactorial hypothesis that he talks about in there ever really w|snt anywhere, but 

Q.  Okay.

A.   so, I mean, I'm not saying that 

0.  It's a memo.

A.  It is  it's a memo.

Q,  I'm going to go in more detail.  Yeah, I'm going to go through the memo.  I guess I'm really talking about where Panzer is talking to Kornegay

and CCing William Kloepfer and he's saying, hey, we've had this strategy that was brilliantly cbnceived, and over 20 years it was a holding strategy consisting of creating doubt about the health charges.  You would agree with me if they did that  if they did have a holding strategy to create doubt about the health charges, that would nbt be the right thing to do?

A.  I don't -- I don't know that it would, based on my knowledge today.  At the time if you think that cigarettes are being falsely accused, then having a strategy to try to deal with that situation isn't necessarily a bad thing.

But I take your point, if your whole purpose was to simply deny something to the public that you knew was not right or appropriate, then that would be absolutely wrong.

Q.  okay.  And then it goes on at the bottom, it says, on the litigation front for which the strategy was designed it has been successful; do ybu see that?

A.  I do

Q,     Then  it says under political front,   the strategy has helped make possible an orderly rfctreat;  did I  read that correctly?

A. The whole paragraph? Q*    Yes.

A.  In the cigarette controversy, the public  especially those who are present and pbtential supporters (e.g., tobacco state congressmen and heavy smokers) ~~ must perceive, understand, and believe in evidence to sustain their opinions that smoking may not be the causal factor.

Q. Okay. So they wanted the public to perceive, understand, and believe in evidence that smoking may not be a causal factor of lung cancer, correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objeot to the form. THE WITNESS: What they're saying is that that would  that would have to be the case in order for people to continue to support the idea that there was another side of the  the discussion.  That's what  that's the meaning of that paragraph.

Q.  Okay.  Okay.  And by the way, do you know whether -- whether Panzer was the vice president of the Tobacco Institute?

A.  I don't know his position.  I know this is an internal Tobaooo Institute document.

Q. Are you familiar with a film titled The Answers We Seek, which talks about the constitutional hypothesis and the multifactorial hypothesis that are discussed within this memo?

A.  Am I familiar with that film? Not that I'm aware of, no.

SPEAKER:  This is American today, the pace fast, the competition great.  We live with more tension, more emotion, more concern about our health, more everything than ever before. Specifically we will be looking into one of the more controversial aspects of modern life, tobaooo and its use, particularly in cigarettes.  To help us gain new perspective on the question of smoking and health, we will hear from world-renowned scientists and experts.  No single typo of cancer has provoked

more questions, more controversy than cancer of the lung.

Lung cancer is predominantly a disease of people who live in large cities or industrial areas; whereas, people who live in rural communities have a much lower incidence of lung cancer.

SPEAKER: There are substances in the air in every city in the United States and I suspect in every city in the world which are known to produce cancer.

SPEAKER:  This becomes especially interesting when we recall, as Dr. William Ober has pointed out, that the vast majority of cigarette smokers don't get lung cancer while animals who obviously don't smoke at all do. Dr. Herbert L. Ratoliffe has noted a significant increase in the frequency of lung cancer in waterfowl, especially in two species of ducks at the Philadelphia Zoo, located in a typical city air pollution area.

Many persons attribute the reported rise of lung cancer to cigarette smoking.  Others, Dr. Langston, for example, question this assumption*

A.  Hold on.  That is -- well, I mean -~ it's obviously a multifactorial hypothesis, yeah, I wbuld include that.

don't know whether  I don't think it's appropriate to talk to kids about our advocating smoking, no, but, you know, if -- if the company was written to or asked either via schoolchildren or through principals, the company policy was they would respond and tell them what our opinions were. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Okay.  So -- but in these letters when you responded you wouldn't -- you wouldn't set forth to the school  school kids, you wouldn't say, hey, listen, there's a lot of scientists out there who believe smoking causes cancer, and we actually have scientists at R, J, Reynolds who believe that, too, but we're not 100 percent convinced. Was that what ybu were telling these school kids?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to.form. THE WITNESS:  I think ~- I think in response to letters that we were asked what is our position, and so we would give it.  I mean, I think it's obvious that school kids were certainly getting the public health message.  I meant, I went to school during the '70s.  I was in grammar school.  I never questioned whether or not cigarette smoking was bad for me.  I was

being told all the time in school.  So, I mean, I think it's pretty clear they were -- they were getting that message. BY MR. PAIGE:

Q, Okay.  I  you know, I don't want to get into a whole issue of youth marketing with you.  I will  by the way, so you heard when you were in school that smoking was bad for you?

A.  Absolutely, yeah.

Q.  So did you learn when you were in school that there were 70 carcinogens in smoking, that if you started smoking you oould become addioted and that 50 percent of addicted smokers died, did you learn that in elementary sohool?

A*  I learned in elementary sohool that if you started smoking you would have a really hard time quitting.  So I don't know that anybody said it was addictive in the '70s, but they certainly said it was dangerous and I saw pictures of diseased lungs and a whole host of other things growing up.  So I've always known that smoking, or at least I always believed growing up that smoking was dangerous.  I started grammar school  I started kindergarten in '69, and I graduated high school in '82,

A,  I mean, I've seen a lot of -- I've seen a lot of public health statistics.  Anywhere from --I've seen as, I think, as low at about 70 to 90 percent.

Q.  Okay.  So up to 90 percent of all smokers start by the age of 18, like you did, oorreot?

A.  I believe that is -- I mean, I've seen that, yes.

0.  And the third paragraph, if you oould read the first sentence into the record, please.

Q. And if you can go to the last page and read into the record can't identify harmful substance.

A. Okay. Read the whole paragraph is what --

Q,  please.

A.  -- you're asking?

Q.  Please.

A.  In all the research that has been going on, no study has reported finding any substance as found in cigarette smoke that causes human lung cancer or other disease.  Those who glibly talk about removing "the harmful substance" often overlook the fact that not even the oigarette critics can name "the harmful substance."  It is a fact that all of the diseases with whioh smoking has been connected also occur in nonsmokers.  And this leaves a puzzle unsolved: what causes nonsmokers to get diseases which are claimed by some to be "caused" by oigarette smoking?

Q. And if you can go to the next column and read the first two paragraphs, please.

A. The industry does not go along with those who would claim the "issue is settled" and shut off

all discussion on the controversy.  The tobaooo industry believes the American public - all elements, including scientists - have a right to hear all the facts involved in this controversy, not just those advanced by anti-smoking groups. The Tobacoo Institute has prepared several television and radio publio service messages now available for use by the broadcast media, for oxample.

Q.  Okay.  And those Would be  and this is the material that the Tobacoo Institute and the cigarette companies were sending to schoolchildren, correct?

A.  That's what Cahill suggested.

Q. Why would it be important to select scientific goals for purposes such as publio relations, political relations and positions for litigation as opposed to speoifio scientific goals?

Well, I mean, I think based on my review ot the type of work that got funded, I would  I don't know that I can fully agree with this statement.

Q.  So why are all these people saying this in these internal memos baok to the '70s, why  do you have an opinion on behalf of R. J, Reynolds why people like Fred Paneer and this A. W. Spears would be writing things like this?

1        Q.  Okay.  The  but if Curtis Judge is

2   the  the president and CEO of Lorillard Tobacco

3   Cbmpany, do you have any reason to believe or

4   dispute that they would just be fabricating memos

5   of false information for the -~ for what purpose

6   would they do that, Dr. Figlar? I don't understand

7   what ~~ what you mean by that?

8            MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

9            THE WITNESS:  I'm not --  I'm not saying

10       that they generated false anything.  I'm just

11       saying I don't work for Lorillard.  I don't

12       know what was in Spears's head, and I don't

13       agree with the one part of the memo that you

14       made me read that said that basically

15       historically all the funding was around for

16       political and public relations efforts, because

17       I^ve looked at the list of research that was

IB               done and the publications that were put out, so

19       I can't necessarily agree with that statement,

20       sir.  That's all I'm saying.

21            BY MR. PAIGE:

22        Q,  Dr. Figlar, exactly.  You understand that

23   I have a time limit to take your deposition today,

24   correct?

I'm trying to be as thorough --

ft.  And I'm not --

A.  ~" and quick as I can.

ft.  And I'm not criticising your answer.  No, I I'm not criticizing your answer.  I'm just -- you said that I made you read one paragraph.

If I would have you read the entire documents that are here we would never finish the deposition today.  So most respectfully, I have to select portions that seem relevant and you understand your lawyer will have the chanoe to ask ybu questions about other portions he may find relevant.  You understand that, don't you?

A.  I understand how this works, yes.

ft.  Okay.  So the paragraph that you read, I guess my -- my only question to you is:  As the corporate representative for R. J. Reynolds who is here under oath today, you disagree with that statement?

A.  I would,

sorry.  Yeah, 2824, which is Exhibit 33. Do you have that?

A.  I do.

ft.  And what is that document?

A. This is a Tobacoo Institute document called The Tobacco -- The Cigarette Controversy.

Q.  And what was the purpose of this document?

A.  Again, I think this is a Tobacco Institute  excuse me.  I'm trying to talk too fast.  It's a Tobacco Institute advocacy piece with regard to the  the industry's position on smoking and health-related issues,

Q. Okay. But you keep saying it's an advocacy piece.  Isn't it true though that it was being presented in the belief that full, free and informed discussion of the tobacco and health controversy is in the publio interest?

A. I'm sorry. You got a little garbled there. Can you repeat that? I apologize. I couldn't hear you.

ft.  This  The Cigarette Controversy, these are  these are part of the white papers, correct?

a      Atiey are wn*w8 papers,   yes.

A.  I mean, I think they were sent around to the various people that we talked about earlier with regard to where TI was sending stuff to, doctors, scientists, physioians, et cetera.

ft. Okay. Community leaders, oorreot?

A.  Possibly.  Yeah, possibly, yeah.

Q.  And if you could turn to Page 1 and read on the left-hand side what the -- the purpose of this or how it's being presented?

A.  It says, this booklet is presented by the Tobacco Institute in the belief that full, free and informed discussion of the public *" excuse me -~ full, free and informed discussion of the smoking and health controversy is in the publio interest, and in the conviction that the controversy must be resolved by scientific research,

ft, And can you read the first two sentences under the preface.

A. For many adults, oigarette smoking is one of life's pleasures. Does it cause illness - even death? No one knows.

Q,  So that's what the Tobacco Institute and the tobacoo industry was telling people at least in tlfiis oigarette controversy paper in the ' 70s that nb on knows, correct?

A.  I mean, that's what the first two sentences are, but of course, they go into a lot more depth later on, yes,

ft, And we'll get into that, but if no one knows, you would agree that that would also  the no one would include all of the consuming smokers, correct?

A. Correct,

ft. And if you could read the last  last paragraph, please,

A.  Of the preface or of the booklet? ft.  Yes.  Yes.  Of the preface. A.  If smoking does cause disease, why after yftars of intensive research, has it not been shown hbw this occurs? And why has no ingredient as found in smoke been identified as a causal factor?

ft.  So that's part of the campaign of creating dbubt and confusion, is it not, Dr. Figlar? MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  I mean, I think it's a campaign of fact.  If you don't know what the mechanism is, then you  then you have a very difficult time understanding how the disease forms.  If you don't have a causative agent, then it's difficult, especially in a historical

BY MR. PAIGE: ft. Hell, do you know the exact mechanism today?

A.  Do we know the -- you can never know an exact mechanism.  As a scientist  I'm sorry.  If I could finish my answer.

MR. LATHAM:  No, he hasn't finished. THE WITNESS:  But as a kinetioist ~ BY MR. PAIGE: ft.  Okay.

A.   and as a person who wrote mechanisms and published papers on ohemioal mechanisms, I know for a fact that a mechanism can never be proved. It can only be disproved.

Mechanisms can provide guidance in terms of how things are formed. And so you have the best mechanism that you have available at a given point ih time.  Today we have ideas about how mechanistically cancer is formed.  In 1970 you didnt.

Q. Okay, But today R, J. Reynolds and the industry admits that smoking causes lung cancer, correct?

A. We do.

ft.  And in the 1970s you did not know the exact mechanism, correct?

A.  There was virtually no mechanistic research in the 1970s. Today there is a proposed mechanism.  Surgeon General has a mechanism on how they think the disease forms.  So it's a very different situation today than it was in the '70s.

ft.  And so back in the '70s you were saying that does it oause illness, even death, no one khows, correct?

MR. LATHAM: Object to the form. THE WITNESS: They did say that, BY MR. PAIGE:

A,  I'm sorry, the first paragraph under needed:  Objective 

ft. Under elusive  elusive answers, I'm sbrry.

A.  That's fine. First paragraph, throughout these years, answers have been slow in ooming, and paradoxically, theories about causes of illness have broadened as a result of researoh sponsored by many different sources.  Heredity.  Stress. Behavior.  Air pollution.  Viruses.  Occupational hazards.  Immunology.  Things we eat.  Things we drink.  These and more, as well as the hypothesis  hypothesis that tobaooo is at fault, occupy the interests of inquisitive scientists today.

ft. And, again, so that statement there was a white paper that you were disseminating back to the Panzer memo again when they were talking about the constitutional hypothesis and the multifactorial

hypothesis, correct?

the work done has improved dramatically because,

one, targeted research; two, availability of

i federal funds down so tobacco money ain't so dirty

anymore.

ft.  Do you know why they would be referring to tbbacco money being dirty for investigators?

Q,  And do you know why they're referring to the CTR being the best and cheapest insurance that the industry can buy? Do you know what that all m^ans?

A. Well, based on  based on me sitting here t^day, historically I have no idea why.

ft.  Really? As the corporate rep with the mbst knowledge from R. J. Reynolds you don't know why they would be saying that the CT  CTR is the bbst and cheapest insurance the tobacco industry c^n buy and without it we would be dead?

MR. LATHAM:  I'm going to object to the form of the question.

THE WITNESS:  I don't  I don't really have an opinion on that based on the fact that we have spent most of this deposition talking about Tobacco Institute.  I wouldn't agree.  I wouldn't agree with that statement, BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  And the very --A.  I would not.

We'd better know more about smoke components than anyone else.  Okay?

ft.  Why do you think it's important for a tobacco manufacturer to know more about the components of their product than anyone else?

A.  That is the title.

ft. And if you oould just read the first  the first couple paragraphs, please.

A.  Sure.  I was amazed at the trend that the CfcR work is taking.  For openers Dr. Donald H. Ford, a new staff member, makes the following quotes:  "Opiates and nicotine may be similar in action."  Next, "we accept the fact that nicotine is habituating." Next, "there is a relationship between nicotine and the opiates."

ft.  Okay.  So Donald  who is Donald ~~ Donald Ford was somebody who was working for the CTR/ correct?

A.  That's what that suggests here.

ft. And he was making a statement back in 1977 that opiates and nicotine may be similar in action, correct?

A.  That's what that quote is, yes.

ft.  And the next paragraph talks about a Dr,, Loo Abood; do you sec that?

8        ft.  Okay.  But is that what the documents seem

9   to indicate like one of the documents that you

10   looked at talked about a grant by Dr. Abood,

11   correct?

12        A.  It's hard for me to remember the names

14   documents.

21        A.  Certainly.  Dr. Leo Abood, whose

22   presentation showed a high degree of competence,

23   h^s one of his aims a speoific antagonist to

24   nicotine.  This is done by various chemical

clinically acceptable antagonist.

ft.  What does at that mean? What is a specific antagonist to nicotine?

A.  I don't -- I don't really know.  I would assume something that would block or -- block nicotine perhaps, something to work against nicotine.

ft,  Right.  So 

A.  It's not really -- I mean, I'm a chemist. I'm not a microbiologist or pharmacologist.

ft,  Okay.  But in any event, they're talking about the CTR program and Dr. Abood who has this presentation where he's discussing a clinically acceptable antagonist to nicotine, correct?

A.  Well, he -~ he doesn't have one.  He's saying it could lead.

ft.  Right.  He's looking to  he's trying to develop one, correct?

A,  That's what it would suggest.

ft.  And if you could read the last paragraph of the first page.

A.  Certainly.  It is my strong feeling that with the progress that has been claimed, we are in the process of digging our own grave.  I believe that the program was sot up -- excuse met.  I

believe that the program as set up has the potential of great damage to the industry and I strongly urge that the whole relationship of our company to CTR be oarefully reviewed.  I am very miich afraid that the direction of the work being taken by CTR is totally detrimental to our position ahd undermines the public posture we have taken to outsiders.

ft.  Okay.  So in his last paragraph they're talking about digging their own grave -- the clinically acceptable antagonist may be responsible fOr digging their own grave can be damaging to the industry and is detrimental to their position, correct?

A.  That's what it -- well, I mean, I don't k^ow about necessarily just Dr. Abood's work, but hi's suggesting that the CTR program, in general, mfy do that.

ft.  And so with this researcher who was looking to develop in 1977  by the way, just so the jury understands, 1977 at that time, there was ni patch or gum or Chantix or Zyban yet, correct?

A.  At that point, I don't believe so, no.

A.  Possibly.

A.  I don't know that they're mentioning that in here,

ft. But remember  remember back in the Frank Statement where they talked about the public health b^ing paramount to all other considerations of the industry?

A.  Correct.

10   l^gal responsibility.  The manufacturer has a duty

12        ft.  You would agree, though, Doctor, that the

13   manufacturer does have a duty to know its product?

14        A,  I do.

15        ft. And do you agree that the industry never

the most knowledge from R. J. Reynolds, as you sit here today, you still don't know whether or not the CTR was merely a public relations effort?

A.  I don't believe that it was.  I don't think CTR was,  I think the Tobacco Institute in many respeots was.  It was an advocacy group, but CTR as a grant and aid group was not.

ft.  So, again, this is another industry insider from back in the '70s who may be mistaken, correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Quite possibly. BY MR. PAIGE:

Q.  That's what you believe, right?

A.  Based on what I have read and the research that I have done, I don't believe that CTR was solely a publio relations effort. There may have been publio statements made, but I don't believe that is completely the case.

ft.  Okay.  But you don't believe it's completely the case.  You believe it was partially the oase, I take it?

A. I mean, I think it's -- I think it's reasonable to think that CTR did conduct some research in that capacity and that they did amfco

ft,  Okay,  If you oould go to the -*  the --the middle of the paragraph which starts with the word recently.  It's about five lines down, recently it has been suggested,

A. Okay.

ft.  If you could read that to the end of the paragraph, please.

A.  Recently it has been suggested that CTR or industry research should enable us to give quick responses to new developments in the propaganda of the avid anti-smoking groups.  For example, CTR or sbmeone should be able to rebut the suggestion that smokers suffer from a peculiar disease, as widely alleged in the press some few months ago.  A properly designed research effort should encompass the need for instant response on subject  subjects of publio interest in the smoking and health controversy.  Finally the industry research effort has included special projects designed to find scientists and medical doctors who might serve as industry witnesses in lawsuits or in legislative fdrum.  All of thse matters and more should bo

considered in asking what kind of research the industry should do.

ft. What  when  when  when the industry is supposed to be concerned with the publio health, well, do you agree that the industry is supposed to be most concerned with the public health, correct? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form, THE WITNESS:  They should be concerned with the publio health, yes. BY MR. PAIGE:

ft. And so why is it then that they're  they're -- they're  they're commenting that the kind of research that they should be doing the CTR should be doing should include projects designed to find scientists and medical doctors who mfy serve as industry witnesses?

A.  Well, 1 mean, I don't know ultimately what that suggestion is  what need they're trying to serve there, other than reading earlier in the paragraph I think it's obvious that the author

believes that there are avid anti-smoking groups

i out there spreading propaganda about cigarette

smoking and therefore, they're looking for CTR to

hive at the ready research that might be able to

suggest otherwise against the propaganda effort.

So. . .

ft.  But the propaganda effort that you're referring to is the statement that smoking causes lung cancer in people who are smoking?

A. Well, I mean, in essence, there's a number of diseases and other things that smoking was attributed to at the time that the industry didn't believe was correct and they believed there was a propaganda effort being spread obviously by what's written here, so they didn't believe that that was the case and they believed that there was research that could be done that oould refute that,  I mean --

ft.  So we --

A,   by the  by the read of this memo.

ft.  So we know that smoking causes diseases such as lung oancer, emphysema, heart disease, stroke, artery disease, throat cancer, bladder oancer, pancreatic cancer.  I can go on, but those are some of the diseases that are attributed to smoking, correct?

A.  Those are some, yes.

ft.  Is that the propaganda that you're talking about?

A.  At the time that's what they boliovcd,

yes, in essence.

ft.  So as  as people would  as consumers w^re dying from lung oancer, bladder oancer, throat cancer, emphysema, heart disease, throat, pancreatic cancer and things of that nature, the tobacco industry was considering that to be propaganda?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form, THE WITNESS:  They didn't believe that those -- that cause and effect relationships for those types of diseases had been properly established and they felt in some oases that there was obviously a propaganda campaign against them as this memo suggests.  I'm not -* BY MR. PAIGE: ft. Wait.  I want to be clear, that's the propaganda that you're talking about, diseases that were killing the customers, oorreot?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  Again, I don't know what diseases they're talking about.  They said peouliar diseases in here, so I don't know  they didn't specify, but they certainly suggested that there was a propaganda being set up by anti-smoking groups.  They didn't

A.  They were in 1978, yes. ft. And smokers were dying of lung cancer, bladder cancer, emphysema, heart disease, et cetera, oorreot?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS: We would certainly take that view today, yes.

(Figlar Exhibit 41, Memo dated 9/29/78 to C. I. MoCarty from E. Pepples, PT02123, was marked for identification,) BY MR. PAIGE: ft.  Okay.  The next dooument is Exhibit 41, which is PT02123.

MR. LATHAM: Just give me a second, Gary. That might be a document on which we'll assert a privilege objection.

Yeah, Plaintiffs' Exhibit PT2123, Reynolds would assert an attorneyclient privilege work product objection and instruct the witness not to answer questions about the document.  It is a Bliley dooument, a Stolen document.

MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  Again, just for the record, we provided these to you-all 30 days ago.  These are doouments that are routinely admitted in these cases.  I understand your objection, but, you know, for the record, I'll just ask some questions to -- to  to satisfy the record and then our intention obviously would be to have Dr. Figlar appear live at trial to answer these questions.

A.  That is the subjeot,

Q.  And you are being produced here today as the corporate representative of R. J. Reynolds as well as Brown & Williamson and American Tobacoo with the most knowledge of  of the TI, the TIRC and the CTR, as well as the purpose of those entities, correct?

A.  I am the person with most knowledge for  ft>r those companies, yes.

Q.  And this is a dooument that was provided tb you to review in preparation for your deposition, correct?

A. Yes, and I believe I have reviewed it.

Q.  Okay.  Can you read Number 2 for the rfecord, please.

A.  CTR should be controlled both legally and scientifically by representatives of the industry. Implicit in the above, the SAB should be oonsist  constituted with a majority of industry members. Several outside members (but not a majority) should be nominated to the SAB.  These members should not have aooess to CTR funding.

Q.  What --was the public being told that tho C4?R was being controlled both legally and

scientifically by the industry?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  No.  I think this is a recommendation, isn't it, which would suggest that it's not being run scientifically by the industry, so, you know, you're making a recommendation for some  why would you make a recommendation for something that already exists? You wouldn't. BY MR. PAIGE: Q. And Number 3, oan you read Number 3? A.  CTR should fund work largely by means of contracts, thus reserving the right to control publications whioh might be detrimental to the industry.

Q.  Why would there be a recommendation to try to control research?

A. Well, my guess would be that Mr. Osdene doesn't like the fact that the CTR was allowing people to publish stuff that they didn't like.  So, again, why make a recommendation to do something if it's already being done? You wouldn't.

Q. Again, at the end where it talks about subjects to be avoided, what type of subjects did ttyey want the CTR to avoid doing research on, if

	3
	human disease to smoking.
	


	4
	Q. Do you know how many --do you know how
	


	5
	many papers were published by funding by the CTR?

	7
	papers, if I'm not mistaken.
	


	8
	Q,  There are about 7,000, oorreot?

	A.  It's a large number, yes.  I don't know
	


	10
	the exact number, but thousands of papers.
	


	11
	Q.  And do you know how many of those papers
	


	12
	that were published actually attempted to relate
	

c
	13
	hyman disease to smoking?

	are  I know there are certainly some.
	


	16
	Q. Well, there's less than 20, isn't there?
	


	17
	A. Again, I don't know what the count is.
	


	18
	Q. Well, isn't the count of the 7,000, it
	


	19
	would be less than 20 of all the research funded by
	


	20
	the CTR had anything to do with attempting to
	


	21
	relate human disease to smoking; isn't that true,
	


	22
	Doctor?

BY MR. PAIGE:

Q.  The next exhibit I'm going to go through with you, Doctor, we can move on is PT030 --pfc03777, which is Exhibit 47.

A.  Yes, I have it.

Q.  And tell the jury what this dooument is.

A.  It says a Horace R. Kornegay speech, Tobacco Institute annual meeting, January 10th, 1980.

Q.  Okay. And will you go to the second page of  the speech.

A.  Yes, sir.

Q.  And you see in the third paragraph down where it says there's been some notable achievements.  Can you read that, the -- the first bullet point?

A.  The Surgeon General's media event was preempted by an institute --

Q.  No, no.  I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.  If you could start with as a result.

A.  As a result, some notable achievements w^re registered this year.

Do you want me to go on?

Q.  Go on.

A.  Okay.

Q.  Yeah, the bullet points.

A.  The Surgeon General's media event was pte-empted by an Institute first-strike news conference. For the first time in the history of the oigarette controversy, a Secretary of HEW had to share the spotlight.  In fact, we won top billing that night on all networks.

Q.  So the -- the tobacco industry was receiving top billing over and above the Surgeon General to get their message out, correct?

A. Well, it says for the first time in history ever.  But I -- I don't know if I can verify whether or not that's true, but that's what they said, the speech.

Q. Do you know how it was the tobacoo industry was able to preempt the Surgeon General media report?

A.  Do I know? Are you asking me how I know?

Q.  Yes.

A.  I don't know.

Q. No, do you. Okay.  If you go on to the  t^o more pages, you can go  not the next page, but the  the page after, if you could read the first bullet point?

A.  On Page 4?

Q.     Yeah.

A.  Communications have been on the uptrend this year.  Our four speakers covered a quarter of a; million miles, logging nearly 800 appearances, including 300 hours on the air.  Our new publications unit turned out a dozen new publications and distributed over a quarter of a million copies.  The Tobacco Observer has reached a circulation of 86,000. Our films have been seen by about 750,000 people this year -- for a cumulative audience of 3-1/2 million.

Q.  And those are 3-1/2 million people that the tobacco companies are getting their message out to, correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form, THE WITNESS:  That's what  that is what is proposed in the speech. BY MR. PAIGE:

Q. And if you oould go down two more  three more bullet points to our contacts with Congress ahd read that.

A.  Our contacts with Congress, whioh have always been good, are now even better.  Through a systematic program of Hill coverage, we can now

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2^9-9424                                    www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 294

count nearly 300 representatives and 75 senators as grade "A" contacts, whioh means that we know them -- but more importantly, they know us.

Q. Don't you think that the tobaooo industry was a powerful industry, Dr. Figlar?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  I think they probably were. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  And don't you think that it was important to them to be known by people on Capitol Hill? MR. LATHAM: Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  I mean, I think that would be -- I think that's true for every industry, Counselor.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q. Well, but  but -- but for the average Joe or the average smoker, they didn't have that advantage.  They weren't known by anybody on CApitol Hill most likely, right?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form, beyond the scope.

THE WITNESS:  I mean, again, that's  that's  that's just as true today as it was then.

1        Q.  So just as true today that you are -- you

2   still are known by a lot of people on Capitol Hill,

3   the industry?

4        A.  No, your general premise of the average

5   man on the street doesn't have the same access as

6   people on the Hill.

7        Q.  And the next page, if you can go down,

8   where it says in the next few days, if you oould

9   read that paragraph.

10        A.  The whole paragraph or starting in the

11   middle?

12        Q.  No.  It says in the next few days, just

13   that  that two sentences.

14        A.  Okay.  So the middle of that paragraph?

15        Q.  Yes, sir.

16        A.  In the next few days the Surgeon General

17   will release yet another report, this time on women

18   and smoking. We have completed a plan for getting

19   our share of the press coverage surrounding this

20   m^dia event.

21        Q. And what was that press coverage intended

22   t0 do?

23        A.  I don't know.

24        Q.  Well, were they saying  and then the

25   last page, please.  If you can read after lobbying

1    corps, if you can read the last  the two

2    paragraphs.

3         A.  Okay.  On the federal level we intend to

4    improve what Senator Ted Kennedy has described as

5    "probably the most effective lobby on Capitol

6    Hill." With the availability of effective support

7    from TAN and our state lobbyists, we are confident

8    of attaining this objective.

9              Let me stop at this point before I

10    overload you with more good intentions and solemn

11    promises than the 10 presidential candidates we

12    will be hearing so much from in 1980.

13         Q.  Okay.  So when Senator Kennedy -- Kennedy

14    described the tobacoo industry as "probably the

15    most effective lobby on Capitol Hill," do you

16    understand that that was most  most likely true?

17              MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form, beyond the

18        scope,

19              THE WITNESS:  I have really no way of

20        judging or knowing that.

21              BY MR. PAIGE:

22          Q. Do you agree that the tobacco industry did

23    h^ve a powerful lobby on tobacco  on  on

24    Capitol Hill in the '70s -- '50s; '60s, '70s and

25    *^0s?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form, beyond the scope.

THE WITNESS:  Again, I don't know how you rate that effectiveness.

(Figlar Exhibit 48, Memo dated 9/9/80 to Mr. Kloepfer from Mr. Knopick, PT02184, was marked for identification.)

Hi  MR* PAIGE: Q.  The next document, Dr. Figlar, is PT02184, Exhibit 48.

A.  Okay.  Yes, air.

A.  I don't  I don't know  I don't know if it was or not.  I may have seen it in the Duvall County deposition.

Q.  Okay. And this is a memo from Knopick to Kloepfer, oorreot?

A.  It is.

Q.  And they're both representatives of the Tobacco Institute, oorreot?

A.  I believe this is a TI document, yes.

Q.    And halfway down the first page it says, I've spoken previously with Pollin, currently the h+ad of the National Institute on Drug Abuse; do y4u see that?

A.  I do.

Q. And it says, we quoted Pollin saying that cigarette smoking is the nation's leading problem among youths despite the rise in marijuana use; do yc^u see that?

smoking is more addictive than using heroin, hooking two-thirds of the people who ever smoke." Do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q. Was there any  now, this was an internal document, correct?

A.  This is an internal Tobacco Institute document, yes.

Q.  And then on the last page, if you oould read into the reoord the last two sentences, please.

A.  Starting with the lawyers?

Q.  Yes, sir.

A.  The lawyers remind us, I'm told, that the entire matter of addiction is the most potent weapon a -- a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer/cigarette oase. We can't defend continued smoking as "free choice" if the person was "addicted."

Q.  Do you agree with that, Dr. Figlar, that you can't defend smoking as a free choice if the person is truly addicted?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to the form. Beyond the scope.

THE WITNESS;  I don't agree.

BY MR. PAIGE:

Q.  As the --as the corporate representative of R. J. Reynolds with the most knowledge of these documents, does R. J. Reynolds agree that they can't defend smoking as a free choice if the person was addicted?

A.  I don't agree with that.  I think whether o not you're addicted or not you can still quit.

Q.  Do you know what the Surgeon General says about smoking being a free choice if somebody is truly addicted?

A.  Off the top of my head I don't.

Q.  You don't remember reading something from the Surgeon General report recently where they comment that smoking is truly not a free choice if somebody is addicted?

A.  Do I recall that? No, I'm not saying I

i

haven't been --

Q.  Do you 

A.   read that before, but I haven't heard that.  I -- I don't recall that as I sit here.

Q.  Do you know how many addicted smokers die every year?

A.  I don't.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS: Because just knowing the answer to those questions doesn't mean that we can't have an opinion on the matter, and I know other facts.  I know the fact that there are more people today who have quit smoking who are former smokers than are current smokers.  I

So I don't really know that those answers to your question affeot whether or not I have an opinion based on your original question. BY MR. PAIGE: Q. Well, you just said there's more former smokers than current smokers, oorreot? A. That is correct.

Q.  Do you know how many of those former smokers were addicted as opposed to being just chippers?

A. Well, I have to presume based on the data that I've seen, whioh were people that have quit for longer than a year and who smoked more than just one cigarette in a month, that  according to the publio health community a good number of people beoome addicted, so I have to presume that a bunch of those people were addicted smokers.

A.  I will use the publio health data suggestion that what is it, I think 80 percent of people who smoke are addicted, so let's just say 20 percent of the  I think it's up to 60 million smokers  former smokers would have been not addicted.

Q.  You're just speculating. You'd be  A.  Yeah, I am.  But, I mean, you're asking me to speculate.

Q. Are you saying 80 percent of smokers are addicted? Are you saying 80 percent of smokers are addicted?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I'm saying  MR. LATHAM:  It's beyond the scope. You can answer the question. THE WITNESS:  I'm saying I've read publio health data that suggests that large proportions of people who smoke on a regular basis are addicted.  I think I've heard or seen 80 percent before, so I used that in my speculative answer there. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.     Okay.  So that's  you're here today as a

Q.  Of that  of those 40 million, do you know -- to be included within those people who quit smoking, isn't it true that you had to have had to smoke more than a hundred cigarettes in your lifetime?

	are quit, are quit greater than a year, then that

MR, LATHAM:  Gary, we're getting pretty  hold on, Gary, we're getting  we're getting far afield from CTR, TI.  I think you're burning your time.  Dr. Figlar is not here as a corporate rep on -- today on the company's position on addiction or historical research on addiction or numbers of people who are addicted or quit.  So just so that it's clear, we're not designating him in this deposition today on those issues.  He's not prepared on those issues.

MR. PAIGE:  Well, listen.  He ~~ he basioally brought it up, so I have to address it, and I'm not burning my time because of the reason he brought it up.  I'm going to request additional time, but I'm trying to get through it quickly.

A.  They were,

Q.    And they wanted people to be  be able to believe them and rely upon them, did they not? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I believe in general, yes. BY MR. PAIGE: Q. And, in fact, there's a gentleman on the second video who said that he thought if they were dangerous the people that make the oigarettes would let him know, correct?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  That's what -- well, I don't know if that's what he said.  He didn't say exactly that.  He said that they know what they were doing.

A.  That is correct.

Q.  Okay,  If you could read the first paragraph into the record, please.

A.  Certainly.  It says, a number of your fifth grade students have written R. J. Reynolds Tobacoo Company commenting that they do not feel our company should allow the use of our brand names on children's toys and candied oigarettes,

Q.  Okay. And so this letter was responded --was written about not  not exactly 40 years, but almost 40 years after the mouse painting studies, correct?

A.  Roughly, yes.  37 years.,

Q,    And have you  if you oould read the last two paragraphs into the record?

A.  Despite all the research going on, the simple and unfortunate fact 

Q.  No, above that.  No, no.  No, no.  The last two paragraphs on the first page, I'm sorry.

A. Okay. The tobaooo industry is also concerned about the charges being made that smoking is responsible for so many serious diseases. Long before the present criticism began the tobacco industry, in a sincere attempt to determine what harmful effects, if any, smoking might have on human health, established The Council for Research  The Council for Tobacoo Research  USA.  The industry has also supported research grants directed by the American Medical Association:  Over the years the tobacco industry has given in excess of $162 million to independent research on the controversy surrounding smoking ~~ more than all the voluntary health associations combined.

Despite all the research going on, the simple and unfortunate fact is that scientists do not know the cause or causes of the chronic disease

reported to be associated with smoking.  The answers to the many unanswered controversies surrounding smoking  and the fundamental causes of the diseases often statistically associated with smoking --we believe can only be determined through more scientific research.  Our company intends, therefore, to continue to support such research in a continuing search for answers.

Q.  Okay.  So later than 1990 R. J. Reynolds was  was still writing to elementary sohool students telling them that scientists do not know whether or not smoking causes disease, correct? MR. LATHAM:  Objeot to the form. THE WITNESS:  That's not exactly oorreot, R. J. Reynolds did respond when asked and provided information to students when asked.  I don't think this was a proactive letter written to students.  It was in response to a request for information of their views and so they gave them.

smoking, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q. And then in the last paragraph, if you could read the first sentenoe to the jury, please.

A. We would appreciate your passing this information along to your students.

Q,    Do you think that's a good idea to tell fifth grade students that it's not known whether or not smoking causes disease?

A.  Well, I mean, I think the fifth grade students asked about, in essence, what our positions were.  So I don't know if I can say whether or not they should respond or not.  I don't think -- you know, sitting here today I don't think it was probably the right thing to do to respond to these letters from school kids in the first place. Probably should have just left it be.

Those are two videos and just to tell the jury, can you tell them who Walker Merryman is, please, Dr, Figlar?

A.  I believe that's a TI representative. Q.    And this is from  these are from 1988 and 1990, correct, from what you reoall seeing? A.  I don't know the exact dates.  I think they're from the '80s. Q.  Okay.

A.  I'll just have to see.  I think they're from the '80s based on my memory.

MR. PAIGE:  All right.  If we oould play those.

(Video playing.)

SPEAKER: And as far as I'm oonoerned, the bottom line is that we simply don't know scientifically what makes a normal healthy oell suddenly go malignant, whether it's cigarette smoking or diet or genetics or occupational exposures or physical or mental stress, we simply haven't the vaguest notion.

SPEAKER:  When given the opportunity to talk about smoking and health, tobacco representatives will only admit --

A.  I thought it was '89, but that's  '88 to '90 is fine,

Q.  Okay.  And as late as '88 or '89 or '90 the Tobacoo Institute was saying they still didn't know whether smoking caused cancer, correct? That's what they were telling the publio, oorreot?

A,  They did not know.  They oould not make that determination is what they said in the video.

Q. And they wanted the people to believe them, oorreot?

A.  I would say they would, yea. Q.  And if they were lying about it while people were smoking and dying, that would be the wrong thing to do, oorreot?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  It would. BY MR. PAIGE: Q. And so the last exhibit I want to go over with .you

June 8th, 2011, he was a corporate rep in a Duvall deposition, and I believe that you may have been present, Will, I'm not positive. But that's what I've been told, and that some of these documents that you're now instructing him not to answer he did talk about them and was able to answer them, including 2268, which was the front and shield document.  So 

MR. LATHAM:  You may be right.  I don't know that, but I'm not  I can look that up.

MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  But I would just ask you again before we stop the deposition to reconsider and allow me to ask him about those documents that you said were privileged and instructed him not to answer, because he has

It's June 8th, 2011, deposition of Dr. Figlar and it's in the Duvall County case.

Where did the exhibit go that you said that he -- there's an exhibit that I believe I have been told, and 2268 was one of them, the front and

	So these documents that you're instructing

	7
	stick with those objections, that's fine, but

	I know -- this is just from memory, we can
	


	18
	investigate it, but X know that in the Duvall

	related to whether or not the Bliley privilege

A.  It is, yes.

Q. And to your knowledge, was this sent to the Assistant Attorney General of the United States on January 26th, 1954?

A.  It was, yes.

Q.  You were asked some questions during the earlier examination about Reynolds' position on smoking and health and whether or not causation had boon established; do you recall those questions?

MR. PAIGE: Okay. Thank you.  I'll find it.  Go ahead.

MR. LATHAM:  Okay. BY MR. LATHAM: Q.  Dr. Figlar, what is A  Exhibit AS-127, Defendant's Exhibit 3 to the deposition?

A.  This is a  an April 1954 Connecticut State Medical Journal article by Ernst Wynder. Q.  You were asked some questions during trie  during the beginning of the deposition about Dr. Wynder and his studies of skin painting in mice; do you recall that? A.  I do.

Q.  Were those skin painting studies referenced in the Frank Statement? A.  They were.

Q.  At that time what was Reynolds' position as to whether or not the Wynder mouse skin painting

studies represented definitive proof that smoking causes lung cancer in humans?

A. Reynolds' position at that time would have been that they did not constitute definitive proof of a causal link between lung cancer and smoking.

Q. If you'll turn to Page 2, is the title of this artiole by Dr. Wynder The Place of Tobacco in the Etiology of Lung Cancer?

A.  That is the title.

Q.     I want to direct your attention to Page 326, please.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q. On the right hand section do you see the paragraph that begins the fact then?

A.  I do *

Q.  I'm going to read that for you.  The fact, then, that the tobacoo data are in agreement with these factors adds considerable weight to the belief that tobacco, especially cigarettes, is of etiologic significance in the production of lung oftnoer.  Such a correlation does not, of course, exclude the possibility that other factors may be of equal or even greater importance in the development of lung cancer; do you see that?

A.  Yes, I do.

lung cancer in  in man.  The mouse skin is not like the bronchial epithelial [sic]  although they both represent epithelial tissue.  The mouse skin test cannot give definitive proof for a human carcinogen, although it has long been used as a reliable tool for testing of carcinogenic materials ahd although historically, as in the cold tar and petroleum studies, a close correlation between animal and human data has been established in regard to epidermoid carcinogenesis.

Q.  Based on your knowledge of the scientific literature at the time in April of 1954, at that time had there been any studies that animals, exposed via inhalation of cigarette smoke, produced lung cancer?

A.  There were none, no.

Q.  The next sentence, written by Dr. Leroy E. Burney, Surgeon General of the Public Health Service, the report documents the major researchers ahd identifies the Publio Health Service with those w^o consider that the evidence to date implicates smoking as the.principal etiological factor in increase in lung cancer; do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q. Will you read the next sentence starting with a number of authorities through facts at the bottom?

A. A number of authorities who have examined the same evidence cited by Dr. Burney do not agree with his conclusions. Although the studies reveal a relationship between oigarette smoking and oancer that seems more than coincidental, they do not explain why, even when smoking patterns are the same, oase rates are higher among men than among women and among urban and among rural populations. Neither the proponents nor the opponents of the smoking theory have sufficient evidence to warrant the assumption of an all-or-nothing authoritative position.  Until definitive studies are forthcoming, the physician can fulfill his responsibility by watching the situation closely,

A.  A tremendous amount of research is being conducted in various institutions and researoh centers throughout the oountry in an attempt to ascertain the cause of this disease. While many theories have been advanced, including the involvement of oigarette smoking, noxious  noxious industrial fumes, and other respiratory irritants, it is the consensus of the Board of Regents of the American College of Chest Physicians that the further -- that further work must be carried out before any single agent or agents can bb definitively implicated.

Q.  And -- and how many years after the Frank Statement was this position put forth by the American College of Chest Physicians?

A.  Probably six.

Q.  You referenced in earlier testimony that one of the Surgeon General's reports that you had reviewed discussed the development of criteria for causation and whether or not those criteria had changed over time; do you recall talking about tl^at?

Q.  If you'll turn to Page 42 of the report, please.  Is there a section in the report titled From Disease Treatment to Risk Management?

A.  There is a section so named, yes.

Q.  Okay.  And will you read the first paragraph underneath that heading.

A.  It says, another possible reason for the delayed response to the Surgeon General's report was its less-than-traditional medical perspective. The report's medical researchers were reporting not the kind of traditional clinical data that p^yeiciane were used to encountering in their

literature but rather data from epidemiological studies that indicated the risks of smoking. Eventually, such data would be persuasive enough to mark a perceptual shift to, quote, a new kind of numeracy among medical researchers and olinioians alike, but in 1964 most physicians were not prepared to understand  muoh less be persuaded by -- the epidemiological data represented in the report, nor to incorporate a public health model into their medical practice.

Q.  Can you explain the scientific basis for Reynolds' position on whether smoking had been provon to cause disease in the 1950s and 1960s?

A.  Yeah, the medical basis would have been mdre traditional.  In '64 I think as the Surgeon General in 2000 points out they changed the dynamics somewhat and more relied on  on -- on s^ts of data that would allow for the publio health community to react quickly.  So  but the previous way in which you would develop cause and effect relationships would have -- would have required lines of evidence around mechanistic understanding of the disease formation, definitive causative agents, provide a variety of models that one oould upci and test to the location of the disease, animal

models that one could use to reproduce results, so a lot of those things I mentioned earlier on were all part and parcel to how cause and effect relationships were previous  prior to 1964 were established.  Afterwards it's not exactly the same.

Q.  I showed you several examples of researchers and medical doctors and their positions on whether smoking has been shown to cause disease and that's Exhibits D-2, D-3, D-4 and D-5.  So my question was:  In a general sense are those statements the kinds of statements that Reynolds would have relied on when it would make statements in the Frank Statement about distinguished authorities may disagree with other distinguished authorities on the question of smoking and disease?

A.  That is exactly correct, yes, those are the types of things that they would have relied on, yes.

Q.  You talked in  in a general sense about the -- the amount of funding and number of articles that were published in the scientific literature based on research sponsored by CTR's grants; do you recall that?

of its existence?

A.  Yes.  So basic summation is that over --300  300  around 300 million dollars was awarded to fund independent research other -- over 1,650 independent scientific research projects were undertaken with CTR grants.  The CTR funded research projects carried out by approximately 1200 individual -- independent researchers.  The CTR grant funded projects resulted in more than 6300 published scientific or medical articles and reports and many of the CTR grants were co-funded with very prominent U.S. health organisations.

Q.  So  can -- do you know of any examples of U.S. health organizations that co-funded CTR research?

A.  In some cases the American Cancer Society co-funded research projects.  So, I mean, there was other health bodies as well that co-funded research projects that CTR funded.

BY MR. LATHAM:

Q,  I want to go through some examples of those.  First, I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Exhibit D-11, which is an excerpt from the 1964 Surgeon General's Report.

MR. PAIGE:  Can you give me the number on that?

MR. LATHAM:  Yes.  It's AS-15. BY MR. LATHAM:

Q.     Dr.   Figlar,  what is Exhibit Defendant's Df-11?

A.  It is a  it is a pull from the 1964 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health,

Q.  If you'll turn to Page 14 of that report, please.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  There's a paragraph that starts with as th primary duty; do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q.  And will you read that paragraph through the word present, please.

A.  As the primary duty of the committee was to assess information about smoking and health, a major general requirement was that of making the information available.  That requirement was met in

three ways.  The first and most important was the bibliographic service provided by the National Library of Medicine. As the  as the annotated monograph by Larson, Haag and Silvette  compiled from more than 6,000 articles published in some lfeOO journals up to and largely into 1959  was available as a basic reference source, the National Library of Medicine was requested to compile a bibliography by author and by subjeot covering the world literature from 1958 to the present.

Q.  Dr. Figlar does -- does this recognition of the use of the Larson, Haag and Silvette text mean that the Surgeon General used it as a reference source in preparing its 1964 report?

A.  Yeah, they used it as a  as a basis so that the National Library of Medicine could truncate their  their search to the  to the years following Larson, Haag and Silvette.  So, y^ah, I would assume they felt that was important.

Q.  After the '64 Surgeon General's Report was released  well, let me take a step back.

Remind the jury what the conclusion of the '$4 Surgeon General's Report was on the question of whether smoking was shown to oause lung cancer.

A.  The '64 Surgeon's General Report says

heavy smoking among men there was a cause of lung cancer.

Q.  After the Surgeon General made that conclusion, to your knowledge did the TIRC stop funding Larson, Haag and Silvette in their production of these reports on smoking and health? A.  No, they did not*

Q. Were there more volumes after the exhibit that we looked at previously produced by Larson, Haag and Silvette over the years?

A.  There were two more volumes I think at least that were produced.

Q.  And there's a section entitled Twins.

A.  Uh-huh.

q  And does this section include a discussion of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer?

A.  It is, yes.

Q.  Under the Twins section it says, the best way to control genetic factors as a potentially complicating variable in studies of lung cancer and cigarette smoking is to conduct the investigation in a population of twins who are discordant as to smoking habits (one smokes, the other does not).

As discussed elsewhere in this report, there are many theories about why people smoke, while in most cases the explanation is not simple, nicotine is a generally agreed-upon faotor, Njlcotine has long been considered habitual  as hfbitual -- let me start over. Nicotine has long b^en considered as habitual at least and, by some persons, as an addictive drug; do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q.  And the references reference 22, reference 37 and reference 54; do you see those references?

A.  I do.

Q. Will you turn to Page 14-103 of the report ahd will you identify who the authors were of reference 37?

A.  37 was Knapp, Bliss and Wells Addictive Aspects in Heavy Cigarette Smoking, American Journal of Psychiatry, 1963.

Q.  Is that the same Knapp and the same title oi  the article that we looked at earlier that was funded by the CTR?

A.  It is the same artiole.

Q. And then if you look at reference 54 --

Q.  Strike that.  If you'll turn to Page 15-20 there*8 a section titled Cessation of the Smoking Habit.

A.  I see that, yes.

Q. And in the very first  sorry -- the second paragraph it says, a number of physiological changes have been observed on withdrawal from tobacco.  Decreases in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure are observed as early as six hours after withdrawal.  Next sentence, these changes persist for at least three days, citing reference 71 and 146, and perhaps for 30, oiting reference 3(7.

Is that the same referenoe 37 to the Knapp article that had been sponsored  sorry -- funded b^ CTR?

Do you have that in front of you? A.  I do,

Q.  What is Exhibit D-22?

A.  It's the 1989 Surgeon General's Report 25 Y^ars of Progress.

Q.  If you'll turn to Roman numeral little iii in the preface.

(Off-the-reoord conference.) BY MR. LATHAM: Q. On the right-hand column the last full paragraph says, during the quarter century that has elapsed since that Report, referring back to the

1964 report, individual citizens, private organizations, public agencies and elected officials have tirelessly pursued the Advisory Committee's call for "appropriate remedial action." Do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q.    Early on,  the U.S.  Congress adopted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of

1965  and the Publio Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969.     Next sentence,   these laws recruired a health

warning on oigarette packages, banned cigarette advertising in the broadcast media, and called for ah annual report on the health consequences of smoking; do you see that? A.  I do.

Q. Were the warnings that are on Exhibit D-23 the warnings that were mandated by Congress? A.  They are.

Q.  Did Reynolds comply with that congressional law and put the cigarette warning libels on all its oigarette packs and advertising? A.  They did.

Q.  If a smoker looked at a Reynolds oigarette advertisement in the '70s and '80s and '90s, would the advertisement have contained the mandated Surgeon General's warning? A.  Yes.

MR. PAIGE:  Objeotion.  All these questions are beyond the scope of what he's being offered as. Are you -- is he now being offered as an advertising and warning expert? Because if he is  or corporate rep, because then I probably do have more questions.  So just to be clear, is he now a corporate representative with knowledge about advertising

MR. LATHAM:  He's not a corporate rep on advertising for sure.  But I think 

MR. PAIGE:  How about warning labels?

MR. LATHAM:  He's a -- he's a -- he's a company rep on the warning labels that Reynolds put on its products.  That's the only question I asked him about that.

MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  Because that wasn't in the notice, but then I'll have to send you a couple of FTC reports that I'll have to address with him in court  in redirect.

MR. LATHAM:  That's fine.  But  but just so it's clear, I don't -- I don't agree that they're beyond the scope because I think you asked him a number of questions about what oonsumers were exposed to, and I think this  this is  puts in context other information they were exposed to that  that we sponsored.

MR. PAIGE:  No problem, but if he's going to talk about warnings, I think he's opening the door to some of these FTC reports that I might be talking to him about.

titled Smoking and Health, An Age-Old Controversy from 1971 by the Tobaooo Institute; do you recall that?

A  I do *

Q. And I want you to turn to Page 3 of that, and do you see a section titled Smokers Aware of Warning?

A.  I do.

Q. And will you read the first sentence after that header, please.

A. A 1967 report to Congress included a government survey finding that 93 percent of all smokers were fully aware of the warning label on the packages.

Q. Okay. Done with that.  I want to direct your attention baok to D-22, whioh was the 1989 Surgeon General's Report.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Do you know whether or not this report contains information with respeot to the publio health official's statements about publio awareness of smoking risks?

A.  It is -- it is included in here, yes.

Q.     Is this information that Reynolds would hive been aware of in the 1980s and '90s?

A.  Certainly.

Q.  If you'll turn to Page 179, please.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q*  Will you read the very first sentence in the section titled Is Cigarette Smoking Harmful to Smokers in General, question mark.

A.  In 1964, 81 percent of adults strongly or mildly agreed that smoking is harmful to Health (treble 2) .

Q.  Is that information Reynolds would have --wbuld have been aware of in  in 1979?

A.  Sure.

Q.  I'm sorry, 1989?

A.  Sure, yes.

Q.  Turning to the next page, do you see Table 2 titled Trends in Public Knowledge About Smoking and Health?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q. And do you see a reference to oigarette smoking is harmful to health (percentage who agree by smoking status)?

A.  I do.

Q.  And does Table 2 cite four different United Health -- excuse me -- four different surveys referencing earlier Surgeon Generals *

reports?

A.  Yes, that's what  yes, they do.

Q.  And with respeot to all adults, what were the percentage of smokers who agree that smoking could be harmful to health?

A.  The  the trend grows from the years.  So the years go from 1964, 1966, 1970 and '75, and the ail adults goes from  goes 81, 85, 87 and 90 percent of all adults.

Q.  And for current oigarette smokers, how do the trends compare to all adults?

A.  They moved similarly.  They go from 70 percent in '64; 78, 79 and 81 percent of current smokers.        

Q.  So you were shown a number of press releases over time from the 19  starting with the Ftank Statement through the 1970s from TI; do you recall that?

A.  Sure, yes.

Q.  So during this same time frame, what did the Surgeon General report about the effectiveness of any strategy to cOnfuse smokers?

A. Well, it wouldn't look like it would be working very well.  The awareness of smoking being harmful continues to increase over that -- course

Q.  Okay.  We're done with that document. You were asked some questions about Plaintiff's Exhibit 3289, whioh was the report on the visit to the U.S.A. from the BAT company; do you recall that?

A.  I do.

Q.  I'm going to hand you that dooument. Mr. Paige read a sentence on Page 2 which said, I think with one exoeption (H.S.N. Greene) the individuals whom we met believed that smoking caused lung cancer if by causation we mean any chain of events whioh finally leads to lung cancer; do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q.  I want you to read the first sentence of the third paragraph under the heading, Causation of Lung Canoer to the jury.  Starting with Greene.

A.  Greene of Yale still says that his repeated failure to produce caroinoma by implanting lung tissue along with tobacco smoke condensate into the muscles of mioe is conclusive evidence that smoke cannot cause lung cancer.  His experiments were not done quantitatively, however,

3        0.  After reading this full report in

4   preparation for this deposition, did you find

5   reported in this document that Greene was, in fact,

6   the only person who BAT met with who did not

7   believe that smoking caused lung cancer?

8        A.  Not really.

9        Q.  If you'll look at the itinerary do you see

10   a reference to meeting with a Dr. Hueper?

11        A.  I do*

12        Q.  Based on your review of doouments, what

13   was Dr. Hooper's position on whether smoking has

14   been shown to cause cancer in the 1950s?

15        A.  In the 1950s W. C. Hueper would not have

16   agreed that smoking was a  could be definitively

17   linked to lung oancer from a cause and effect

18   perspective.

21   should have brought an extra copy.  On the bottom

MR. PAIGE:  For the rule of completeness can you read the next paragraph -- the next sentence, so I don't have to go back to it?

American Cancer Society called a press conference at the Waldorf-Astoria, turned on the floodlights and trumpeted the long-awaited findings of Dr. Oscar Auerbaoh and E. Cuyler Hammond on the effects of cigarette smoking on dogs.  It is an appropriate time to take an anniversary look.

Q.  And will you read the second paragraph, please.

A.  It says, in the field of lung oancer research, the Auerbaoh-Hammond paper probably ranked as the most important paper of the year. Surely it was the most publicized.  The two investigators had devoted three years to their work.  Their study had cost some $750,000, half of it in federal funds.  This was understood to be the breakthrough moment the tobaooo industry, the consumer public and the medical profession had been waiting for.

Q.  And did the American Cancer Society issue a press release about the Auerbaoh Beagle dog study?

A.  They did.  Yes, they did.

Q.    And did the Tobaooo Institute -- we saw earlier  did they issue  their press release about the Auerbaoh Beagle dog study?

A.  They did.  We looked at that, yes.

Q.  Okay.  I want you to move forward in the document, and do you see the paragraph that begins sbme curious things have happened?

A.  I do.

Q.  Okay. Will you read that paragraph, please.

A.  Some curious things have happened.  This milestone paper first was offered to the prestigious Mew England Journal of Medicine, where it was rejected by the reason of the Waldorf publicity.  Then it was offered to the Journal of the American Medical Association, where it was again rejected, this time on the judgment of  of a i reviewing panel that the paper did not meet the Journal's standards.  On June 24th the authors read tfieir paper before a session of the AMA in Chioago. Finally, a much revised version of the report made it to publication in the December issues of "Archives of Environmental Medicine."

Q. Dr. Figlar, was the final artiole that was published in -- in the Journal in terms of its findings and conclusions different than the press release that the American Cancer Society had issued about the report a year earlier?

A.  They were indeed.  They were different conclusions.  The conclusions were not anywhere n^ar as strong and the results didn't bear the same kind of weight that was shown in that large press release at the Waldorf-Astoria a year before.

Q. All right.  We're done with that document. Do you know whether or not the United States Surgeon General has evaluated in its reports the question of whether or not these Beagle dog studies are effective animal models for the production of lung cancer?

A. They are looked at it.

A.  Whereabouts?

Q.  Let's just start with the top -- at the tOp of that section, animal models; do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q. Animal models in whioh emphysema has been induced by elastolytio enzymes have been reported by a number of authors, but for reasons that may reflect a combination of faotors  combination of factors suoh as the shorter lifespan of animals, the method of smoke exposure and the species resistance, there are no published studies that acceptably show in an animal model that the development of emphysema is induced by cigarette smoking, do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q.  The next sentence, thus, a successful animal model has not been developed in which the relationship of different types of cigarettes to the development of emphysema oan be studied; do you see that?

A.  I do.

A.  Invasive and noninvasive bronohoalveolar tumors developed in several of 78 dogs that were trained to smoke through a tracheotomy and that smoked cigarettes daily for 2-1/2 years.  In a gtoup of 24 dogs that smoked nonflltered cigarettes, 2 animals developed early invasive squamous sell oarcinoma in the bronchi.  However, this observation has not been repeated so far.

toll me if I read the statements out of the report properly.  These surveys indicated that the belief that cigarette smoking poses health hazards was increasing, not only among the general public but also among persons who continue to smoke.  For example, in response to the statement "Smoking cigarettes is harmful to health," in 1964, 81.3 percent of the persons interviewed agreed, and 13.1 percent disagreed, but in 1975, 84,9 percent agreed ahd 11.3 percent disagreed with intermediate figures ooourring in 1970. Do you see that?

A. I do.

Q. Was this information that Reynolds would have been aware of in 1981 when this report came out?

A.  Sure, yes.

Q.  Is it the same  is this after the time frame -- well, strike that.

From  from 1964 to 1981, is this the s^me time frame from whioh the exhibits that Mr. Paige showed you that were TI press releases?

Q. Let me ask you a general question and ask you whether you know when a company issues a press release, does that guarantee that the release will be picked up by a news agency?

A. No, it does not guarantee that.

Q.  Did Mr. Paige show you examples of what the news agencies' reporting of the TobaOco Institute's statements would have been in the contemporaneous time as the statements that he showed you?

A.  Not  not  not any that I can recall as I sit here, no.

Q.  So as you sit here, do you know whether all or some or none of the press releases that he showed you were picked up by the press and reported in newspapers in this country?

A.  I mean, I haven't -- I haven't seen the evidence of that.  I mean, we see the press releases.  We know that those records are there, but I haven't seen the reports in a newspaper or a magazine artiole that would indicate that it's in there.

	Q.  Dr. Figlar, I asked you some questions
	

12
	earlier about the Plaintiff's Exhibit P23 --
	

13
	P^3289, excuse me, which was the BAT report on its
	

14
	visit to the United States; do you recall that?
	

15
	A.  Uh-huh.
	

16
	Q.  I have gone through the exhibit and
	

17
	highlighted some paragraphs I'd like you to read
	

18
	for the jury, please.
	

19
	Will you read the first highlighted
	

20
	section, please, Dr. Figlar, it's on Page 1?
	

21
	A.  In the U.S.A. only Berkson, apparently, is

	3
	smoking to the total mortality from lung cancer is
	


	4
	being greatly exaggerated.

	on unambiguously from any single animal test to

	man.  At the same time there was general agreement
	


	14
	in -- general agreement that in the field of
	


	15
	smoking and lung cancer no biologioal test wholly

	free from criticism is available at the present

	A.  It says, the majority of individuals who
	


	21
	we met accepted that beyond all reasonable doubt
	


	22
	oigarette smoke most probably acts as a direct
	


	23

2    undoubtedly represents the majority but by no means

3    the unanimous opinion of scientists in the U.S.A.

4          Q.  Okay,  Then will you read the next

5    highlighted section, please, and tell the jury what

6    page it's on.

7          A.  It's on Page 6.

8          Q,  Okay.

9          A.  It says, others, including the SAB of

10    TIRC, and a group at the National Cancer Institute,

11    do not accept that a oase has yet been made that

12    the tobaooo smoke is directly carcinogenic to the

13    human lung.  While accepting broadly that oigarette

14    smoking may be said to be capable of "causing" lung

15    oancer they argue that the evidence favors some

16    indirect mechanism of causation.

17          Q.  Is that it?

18          A.  Yep.

19          Q,  And if you go back to the very first page

20    or the second page with the list of people that

21    they met with, does it include members outside the

22    industry at prominent medical research facilities?

23          A.  It does.  It has National Cancer

Q.  Is there a reference on the second page of the document to a meeting held at R. J. Reynolds?

A.  Okay.  Yes.

Q.  You read a lot of this.  I just want you to read the paragraph that you didn't read for Mr. Paige whioh I have highlighted on that copy, please?

14
	didn't have a ohanoe to read earlier in the

16
	A.  All right.  It says in all oaps IMPORTANT:
	

17
	if the paper contains any conclusions or findings
	

18
	unfavorable to tobacco, these are reported
	

19
	scrupulously.  The account of these findings may be

11   t^e health risks of oigarette smoking?

12        A,  They would have, yes.

20            SPEAKER:   have an epidemic of lung

21       cancer.  There will be about 150,000 new cases

22       of lung cancer in the United States in the year

23       1987.  In contrast, 65 years ago there were

24       probably only a few thousand oases in the

25       entire United States.

SPEAKER:  What has caused this alarming increase?

SPEAKER:  Almost all of the epidemic is due to oiorarettes and other forms of tobaooo. (End of video) BY MR. LATHAM: Q.  Was that information that was also on the news program that was Plaintiff's Exhibit 4663? A.  It would have been, yes. Q.  And would that have been information that if someone watohed the news program they would have seen it?

A. They would have seen it. They would have been presented with that view as well.

Q.  And I'm going to play for you a clip from Defendant's  I mean, from Plaintiff's Exhibit 4720D.  This is, for the record, a statement by Edward Brant.

(Video playing.)

MR. BRANT:  I think that there's very little question that the scientific evidence now is overwhelming that oigarette smoking is, in fact, related directly to the development of many cancers, of heart disease, of other diseases, including malformed infants and so

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-2179-9424                                    www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

1       forth.  So I  I think that prudence alone

2       would dictate even to a skeptic that it would

3       be better not to smoke than to run the risk of

4       developing one of those illnesses whether or

5       not you believe that oigarette smoking causes

6       these illnesses.  I think, and my own

7       scientific judgment is, that there's little

8       question that oigarette smoking is, in faot,

9       the prinoipal cause of those illnesses.

12        Q.  You were shown a clip earlier from .that

13   slime program of the Tobaooo Institute's statement

14   about the question of smoking.  If a person was

15   watching that news program would they also have

16   been exposed to that information from that publio

17   health researcher?

Q,  And the Conolusion Number 1 says -- and toll me if I'm reading this correctly for the jury, although -- and this is from 1958, correct?

A.  Correct*

Q. And it says, although there remains some dOubt as to the proportion of the total lung oanoer mortality whioh can fairly be attributed to smoking, scientific opinion in the U.S.A. does not n<>w seriously doubt that the cstfctietical

A.  Not really, no.

Q. Are you aware of funding that the American Medical Association was getting through the tobacco industry up until 1971?

A.  I don't.

A.  It -- it is saying that, yes.

Q. And in the second page, in the last paragraph, if you oould read the first  the first sentence to the jury, please.

A.  It's -- the last paragraph, sir?

Q.    Yeah, the first sentence of that paragraph,

A. Howard said he regards the program as a g^eat liability  that from AMA's view it has only caused further blackening of AMA's image.

Q, Do you have an opinion or do you know whether the AMA has stated publicly that they regretted being involved with programs with the tobacco industry up to 1971?

A.  I don't know whether they havo or not.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  -- which was dated 1961, oorreot?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And by the way, do you agree that the industry considered Larson and Haag to be people who were providing friendly research to them?

A.  I don't know whether or not that was  that is true or not, but I know they were -~ they certainly received funding from TIRC.

	Q.  It's a document, it's dated February 3rd,

	l
	A. As a result of discussions with
	


	2
	Mr. Neiley, Dr. Haag was asked nearly a year ago to
	


	3
	lbok about for a man having the desired
	


	4
	qualifications.  He should combine ability and
	


	5
	experience with a broad-minded attitude toward the
	


	6
	tobacco industry.  It was not until reoently that
	


	7
	Dr. Haag oould find anyone whom he considered well
	


	8
	qualified for the position.  He has now recommended
	


	r
	Dr. Larson, who is a young physiologist with a good
	


	10
	background, experience and a fine personality.
	


	11
	Q.  So is that initially how Larson and Haag
	


	12
	became involved in the tobaooo industry?
	

v^
	13
	A. Well, again, look, I don't  I don't know
	


	14
	what this paper is.  They may have been involved in
	


	15
	the 1940s, but, I mean, I'm not sure what this
	


	16
	document is.
	


	17
	Q.  Okay. And then D-8, this exhibit, this
	


	18
	Larson and Haag manual, do you know how many
	


	19
	different articles -~ research articles they
	


	20
	provided to the Surgeon General and why they
	


	21
	provided so many?
	


	22
	A.  They provided I think  summarized and
	


	23
	provided abstraots to over 6,000 articles, oompiled
	


	24
	research from, starting I think in the 1800s, if my
	


	25
	memory is right, up until about 1959 or so.

Q.  Right.  Isn't it true that the tobaooo industry wanted  they wanted this research to be so vague and incomplete and to be irksome to the reader?

A.  I don't agree with that.  I think the Larson, Haag and Silvette manuscript is a full compendium of what was known about tobaooo and cigarettes, the biological effects, the nature of njicotine, et cetera, is in that volume.  It's  it's really just a pull together and a review of everything that was written about tobaooo up to tfiat point.

A.  Surgeon General's warning:  Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health.

Q.  That is not a warning that is voluntarily placed there by American Tobacoo, is it?

A.  No, it is not.

Q.  Would you put that warning there if Congress didn't require it?

A.  No.

Q. And the reason is simply American disagrees with the warning, doesn't it?

A.  We certainly do.

Q.  You don't think they harm smokers so there's no reason to put any warning on them, do y^u?

A. We believe our product is not injurious to health.

Q.  As far as you can  as far as you're concerned, is the Surgeon General simply wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?

A.  I would use the term misguided.

Q.  If he's misguided, then I take it that y<>ur opinion is he's wrong?

A,  I'm simply trying to bo polite about it.

Q.  Okay.  But not being polite about it, in your opinion he's wrong, correct? A. Dead wrong.

Q,  Congress is wrong in requiring these warnings, correct?

A. We do not think they're justified. Q,  So they're wrong? A. They're wrong. (End of video) BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  So, Dr. Figlar, as you sit here today as an R. J. Reynolds' corporate rep in 2014, in sworn testimony, watching the American Tobacoo oorporate r^p who gave sworn testimony in 1986, do you agree with what was being said at that time by Mr. Heimann?

MR. LATHAM:  I'm going to object to the predicate in the question.

THE WITNESS:  Do I agree with it? No, I wouldn't have agreed with  with Mr. Heimann, but that was the  in essence, the opinion and the position of the companies is that it had not been established and proven and that warnings were not required.

Q.  And you've told the  with Mr. Latham you Went through the effectiveness of the warnings and talked about how effective the warnings are; do you remember doing that?

A.  I don't --

Q.  How many people had seen and believed the warnings on the packages of oigarettes, do you remember talking about that?

A.  I remember talking about the awareness of the dangers of oigarette smoking.  I don't know if that was directly connected to the warnings, but certainly awareness of the dangers of cigarette smoking.

Q.  Okay. And you also talked about the 1967 FTC report; do you remember talking about that?

A.  I don't.  No.

Q.  Okay. Well, it was in a dooument that he showed you that you read from. You read a document where you mentioned the '67 FTC report. You don't recall that?

A.  I don't know if I am or not.  I've read a number of FTC reports.  I don't know specifically t|h '67 report what it may or may not entail. (Figlar Exhibit 81, Federal Trade Commission Report to Congress Pursuant to the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, June 30, 1967, PT03870, was marked for identification.)

BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  All right.  All right.  Well, I'll show it tj> you.  It's Exhibit 81 and it's PT03870 and it's tjie FTC report to Congress in 1967, and it addresses one of those warnings that you talked ahout on the packages of oigarettes.

A.  I do.

Q.  Please.

A.  If oigarette sales are viewed as an index of the effectiveness of the warning statement, one finds that in 1966 more cigarettes were sold than ever before.  Even during January and February 1966, the first two months that the warnings  the warning appeared on the oigarette packages, oigarette sales were higher than they had been during the same months of the preceding year.

Q. And then if you oould turn to Page 7, please, and read the highlighted portion which explains this.

A. Page 7?

Q.  Yes.

A. The failure of the warning statement on packages to have any discernible effect on cigarette consumption is easily explainable.  The warning statement on the package alone has proved to be ineffective mainly because few people seem to pay attention to it.

Q. And you can go on. There's another part.

hypothetical but... BY MR. PAIGE: Q,  Okay. Well, let's look at Page 2  Page 9, the second page, if you oould read the highlighted portion of the 1981 FTC report to the jury, please.

A. All right.  It says, while most Amerioans ake generally aware that smoking is hazardous, some consumers, especially smokers, do not know this basic fact.  However, even if it is assumed that every consumer is aware that smoking is hazardous, the evidence indicates that many consumers do not hive enough information about the health risks of smoking in order to know how dangerous smoking is, lie., what it is, what is the nature and extent of the health risk of smoking. Many consumers also do not know whether the general health risks of smoking have any personal relevance to themselves o^ whether they are among those groups of people

Who may be uniquely vulnerable to these health hazards.

Q.  Okay.  And so this is  this is talking about the publio awareness in 1981, correct?

A.  This report was in 1981, yes.

Q.  And if you oould read the highlighted portion on Page 10 to the jury, please.

A.  However, even for lung cancer, the most well known health effect, some gaps in consumer knowledge are evident.  Thus, approximately 20 percent of those polled do not know that smoking causes cancer.

The data also indicate that substantial numbers of consumers seriously misunderstand and underestimate the increased risks of suffering these health problems as a result of smoking, for example, the survey data discussed in Chapter III indicate that over 40 percent of those polls --polled do not know that smoking caused most (80%) cases of lung cancer and nearly one-quarter of those polled did not even know it causes many crises.

Mr. Paige, 30 minutes has elapsed, as you asked me to remind you about*  You have 21 minutes remaining.

MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  Thank you, THE WITNESS:  In 1978, 54 million Americans smoked a total of 615 billion oigarettes. Many of those smokers are uninformed about the serious health consequences of smoking. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  And if you can go to Page 2-3 and read the highlighted portion to the jury, please.

A.  The amount of oigarette advertising in the United States.  Cigarettes are the most heavily advertised product in America.  The next portion it s^ys, the National Commission on Smoking and Public Policy reported in 1978 that the tobacoo industry s^ent more on advertising cigarettes in one day than the (then) National Clearinghouse on Smoking ahd Health, the government's primary agency working in the area, spent in one year.

Q. And, again, since you brought it up, if we o^nild talk a little bit more about the public awareness of the dangers of smoking, if you could r^ad from Page 3-6 into the record, please.

A. Which portion  whioh highlighted portion?

Q.  The second -- the second part whioh is many consumers.

A. Okay. Many consumers who have heard that the Surgeon General has determined that smoking is dangerous, do not generally know, for example, (a) what diseases are smoking related, (b), what is the generally increased likelihood of suffering from these diseases as the result of smoking, or (c) what effect these diseases have on the likelihood of suffering a premature death.

Q. When the tobacco industry was reading this FJTC report and worrying about this lack of awareness, what were they doing to help people? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.     In 1981?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know  I don't know that they  that they had done anything other than what we've talked about before. They had their positions.  They had their opinions on these issues.

Q. Okay. And if you can go to Page 3-8 and 3-10 and read that into the record, please, Dr. Figlar. '   A.  3-8, knowledge of more information about

the health hazards of smoking is relevant to

! consumers' awareness of whether the health risks

associated with smoking have any personal

t application to themselves or whether they are among

those who are particularly vulnerable to these

health hazards.  For example, some consumers

incorrectly believe that while smoking may be

hazardous to others, it is not hazardous to

themselves because of the particular type of

oigarette they smoke or the amount they smoke.

Of particular concern in this group 

Q.  Hold on.  I'm sorry.  Go ahead, Doctor.  I apologize.

A. Okay.  It's in a different section of the paragraph.  It says, of particular oonoern in this group are teenagers who are unaware of the potentially addictive nature of oigarette smoking, ahd who, therefore, may be tempted to experiment with smoking.

Q.  And so this was 1981, again, where we're talking about teenagers being unaware of the

1    addictive nature of smoking, correct?

2         A.  That's what this says.  I don't know that

3    I would agree that teenagers are unaware.  I was

4    certainly a teenager at that time and I was fully

5    aware.

6         Q.  Right.  You -- you were fully aware about

7    hbw addictive nicotine was in 1981?

8         A. No, I was aware of certainly the dangers.

10    nature.  It doesn't say is.

11         Q.  Okay. And if you oould read 3-10, please,

12    Dr. Figlar.

13         A. Certainly. Based upon an analysis of all

14    the data reviewed in its entirety, staff has

15    cbnoluded that there appear to be such significant

16    g*ps in consumer knowledge that a substantial

17    portion of the population does not know how

18    dangerous smoking is, or whether the dangers of

19    smoking apply to them, and, therefore, does not

20    hfve an understanding of the health hazards of

21    smoking. More specifically, the data suggests that

and underestimate the extent of the increased risk of suffering these health problems as the result of smoking; (c) many seriously under -- underestimate or are unaware of the severity of these health consequences and the increased risk of premature death from these illnesses; and (d) a significant number of consumers incorrectly do not believe that these health consequences have any personal relevance to themselves.

A.  I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to explain my answer, that what we have is two sets of plaoes in t^e government that are suggesting that the information in the reporting is contradictory.

So you have the Surgeon General on the one hand saying awareness is very high and now we're skying from the FTC from Matt Myers who was the program advisor that -- that not enough information ip known.

Q.  Okay.  This is 1981?

A.  Correct.

Q. We have another report eight years later in 1989 that I'm going to talk to you about, but my question to you, Dr. Figlar, most respectfully, is i(i 1953 the tobacco industry issued a statement spying the publio health was of paramount concern t<> them, correct?

A.  That is correct.

Q. And in 1981 when the tobacco industry was reading this report from the FTC and the government, what did they do to help their consumers?

A. With regard to awareness I'm not sure. Wl|at they did to their products was try to lower the tar and nicotine levels of those products.

Q. Whioh oontinued to kill their customers?

THE WITNESS: They  they did -- they did not eliminate the risk.

BY MR. PAIGE: Q. And so if we can go to the next page, 31-11, if you oould read that highlighted portion to the jury, please.

A.  Hold On. The data, projected nationwide, indicates that some Americans still do not even know that smoking is hazardous to health.  In 1978, Gallup asked respondents whether they believed smoking was harmful to health. Although 10 % of the sample did not know that smoking had any harmful effects, 17 % of all smokers did not know that smoking is harmful to health, and nearly one out of every four - 24 % - heavy smokers did not k^ow this fact.

In the 1978 Roper Study, 9% of the total

simple, 13% of all smokers, and 20% of two pack or

m4>re a day smokers did not know that smoking was

hazardous.  Given that there are approximately 54

i million smokers in this country, these data suggest

that millions of Americans vrho smoke still do not

kiiow that smoking is harmful to their health.

A.  It says, there are two major objective indicia of the ineffectiveness of the current warning disoussed in detail below.  First, as the staff's investigation of consumer knowledge has demonstrated, a substantial portion of the public remains uninformed about the hazards of smoking. Second, tests conducted by the FTC (confidential information omitted) indicate that the warning is neither noticed nor read by the vast majority of people.

Q.  And finally, Dootor, I apologise, I appreciate your patience, if you oould read 4-10 to the jury, please.

A.  For four basics reasons, described in detail below, the current warning is not accessible, and therefore, not  cannot be effective.  They are:  (1) the current warning is overexposed and worn out; (2) the current warning is no longer novel and presents no new information; (fc) the abstract nature of the current warning

current warning is not likely to be perceived as personally relevant.

In contrast to the current warning, cigarette advertisements present positive

information about smoking in a highly effective manner.  They communicate the desirable aspects of smoking in a variety of attention-getting formats. Having attracted the reader's attention, the ads present positive information about smoking through ntimorous conorete image-provoking, personalizable themes, each theme presented in many different w^ys.  Information that is distinctive in form, n|>vel or varying in content, concrete, and personalizable is precisely the type of information that people are most likely to notice, think about and spontaneously recall.

Q.  Okay.  So, Doctor, in addition to what you ti>ld the jury on cross about warnings and publio awareness there was more information in the 1967, the  and the 1981 FTC reports as well as the 1989 Surgeon General report, oorreot?

A.  I'm sorry? There was what?

0.  You  you went over with the jury the 1989 Surgeon General Report, oorreot?

A.  I did.  I believe that's correct.

Q.  There were portions of the report you didn't go over with the jury though, oorreot?

A.  I did not go over the whole report, no. Ji^st like you have not gone over the whole reports

Q. Well, the documents are admitted into

portions of the '89 report that I'd like to discuss

knowledge noted above, a substantial number of Americans are still uninformed about or do not believe the health risks of smoking.  These gaps in knowledge or beliefs are more evident when one considers the proportion of adults who do not acknowledge certain health risks rather than the proportion who do.  For example, among smokers --for whom the information is particularly -- and that's it.

Do you want me to keep reading? Well, you just out it off there.  It goes on to a different page.

Q.  On 223 can you read that  that  that highlighted portion, please.

A.  Sure. Although empirical evidence is sparse, tobaooo industry activities in the form of advertising and promotion, publio relations, and lobbying may interfere with publio beliefs and personalized acceptance of the health risks of smoking. Because most individuals may not understand how smoking causes the diseases with

whioh it is associated, many persons may be

i

vulnerable to information that attempts to oast doubt on such relationships.  These industry activities are reviewed in Chapter 6 and 7.

1        Q.  So, Doctor, in this paragraph they're

2   talking about things that you and I had talked

3   about earlier where the internal documents were

4   talking about things suoh as publio relations and

5   lobbying; do you remember that?

6        A.  They do and they say in the first sentence

7   that the empirical evidence is sparse, first

8   sentence.

9        Q. And it goes on to say  and it goes on to

10   say, the tobaooo industry activities in the form of

11   advertising promotion, publio relations, whioh we

12   disoussed earlier, and lobbying, whioh we disoussed

13   earlier, may interfere with publio beliefs and

14   personalized acceptance of the health risks of

15   smoking, correct?

16        A.  That is what it says.  It says, it may

17   interfere, but that evidence is sparse, that's

18   correct, yes.

19        Q.  Is that what the tobaooo industry was

20   trying to do, interfere with the publio belief?

21   Were you trying to do that?

tobacco industry's views on these issues were. So if that is in contradiction to some of things publio health community would say, then ultimately they were at odds. BY MR. PAIGE: Q. And then it says, many persons may be vulnerable to information that attempts to oast dt>ubt on these relationships, oorreot? A.  It says that, yes. Q. And so when you --: when the tobaooo industry learned that or read this in the 1989 sjirgeon General Report, did they oome forward to tjie publio and apologise for all those statements wnere they were trying to oast doubt on the health effects or the relationship between smoking and cancer?

MR. IiATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  No, they did not. BY MR. PAIGE: Q. They kept doing it, right?

And they're not completely without scientific merit.  So I can understand their position and it's more complex than certainly you would like to portray.  So how does it make me feel? It makes me feel  you know, I certainly empathize with people who have suffered from

So that is what  BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  What about the  A.   I'm trying to do, Q.   people who have already died?

THE WITNESS:  I mean, I can  I can certainly empathize and understand it, but I certainly know that my grandparents believed that they were  that they understood the risks associated with smoking. They continued to do so, and they enjoyed smoking.  So there is  there is another side to that as well. BY MR. PAIGE: Q.  Your grandparents aren't here today to tell us that. That's you telling us that that's what your grandparents felt, right, as  as a cigarette manufacturer representative, that's what you want us to believe, right?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS: Well, I don't have any grandparents left anymore, so, yeah, that would be true.

Page 457 * * * THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  Back on the record. The time is 8:00 p.m. BY MR. PAIGE: 0.  Okay.  Dr. Figlar, I apologise for the  the audio feed there, but just for the reoord if you oould just read the last two paragraphs from tfie 1989 Surgeon General Report I would appreciate it.

A. Okay. All right.  It says  I'm trying tb think of where  I was -- I was here.  If 20 rajLllion of the 70 million children now living in tfie United States smoked cigarettes as adults (iibout 29 percent), then at least 5 million of them will die of smoking-related diseases.  This figure should alarm anyone who is concerned with the future health of today's ohildren.

Two additional factors make smoking among children ~~ among young people a preeminent public health concern:  (1), the age of initiation of smoking, and (2) nicotine addiction. As this report shows, four-fifths of smokers born since 1935 started smoking before age 21.  The proportion of smokers who begin smoking during adolesoence has b4en increasing over time, particularly among

Q.  And, Doctor, the last paragraph of that page says that these two factors refute the argument that smoking is a matter of free choice. Most smokers start as teenagers and then become addicted, correct?

A. That's what it says.

Q. All right. Thank you very much, Doctor. I appreciate your time.

EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT BY MR. LATHAM:

Q.  Dr. Figlar, stay, on the same exhibit.  I want to have you read two more things on  on Page Roman numeral iv.  It's right before what you were just reading.

A. Okay.

Q.  I'm going to  do you see on the left-hand column there is a sentence that begins the anti-smoking campaign?

A.  It does, yes.

Q.  Did the '89 Surgeon General's Report report that, quote, the anti-smoking campaign has been a major public health success.  Those who have participated in the campaign can take tremendous pride in the progress that has been mad; do you

Beoauae of the grave nature of a nuabor of recently highly publiciied research reports on the effect* of cigarette sackingi widespread publio interest has dove!oped, causing great concern within and without the industry.

These development* have confronted the industry with a aerious probleat of public relations*   Obviously, that problea would be quickly solved if the adverse publicity would cease and people would etop telMng tibotit the whole natter.

But there ia no evidence that the publicity has abated, or is about to abate, or that the research workers who are critical of cigarettes are coins to cease thae criticlens,   A cheek aoong national aagasinea /****"                             indleatei that other periodical* are considering articles on the eubjeot.

Among the* are yonan.Vi Hone Cceanion, took and Cosmopolitan.   The February issue of Pageant has an article public!ring the Vynder researches,

There is nothing the manufacturer a can say or refrain fro* saying that can step people from being interested in their health, nor alley their fear of cancer.   So long as the caunes and cure of this dread disease remain unknown people will be subject to waves of fear regarding it,

It ia important that the Indue try do nothing to appear in the light of being callous to const derations of health or of belittling aedical ro* aeareh which goes against cigarettes.

The industry should lone no time in Making it completely clear to the Anrican people that it is not uuaindful of the public health.

There ia an evident urgency about the natter which makes it advisable to suggest certain imediate etepe,   A fully rounded-out progra*

will be developed when there has been enough time to Make a more oopre       v hensive study of additional aspects of the proble* and to think through Various couraea of action and projects.

The situation ia otw of extreme delicacy.   There is Mich at atake and the industry group, in moving into the field of public relations, needs to exercise great care not to add fuel to the flames.

The recowwmdftd approach is conservative and long-range,   lfe do not believe the industry should Indulge in any fiaahy or spectacular ballyhoo.   There ia no publio relatione nostra*, known to ua at leastf tbioh will cure the ilia of the industry with one BWallow,   The need J a for a soundly oonoeived and effectively executed program baaed upon Continuing reeearch and factual information.

It would be a nietake for the industry group to inaugurate the contemplated program unless it is prepared to Mintain it for a adnisuwi of thro* year*.   The results of soae of the odical research suggested could hardly be in hand abort of that period of tine,

The underlying purpose of any activity at this stage should bo ^assurance of the public through wider cownunication of facta to the public*   It is ittportant that the public recognke the existence of weighty aoientific viewa which hold there ia no proof that cigarette looking ia a cause of lung canoer?

In connection with the proposed activity, it ia iaposaible to overlook the fact that aone of the industry*a advertising baa oaie in for Serious public criticism bcoauee of e^plmaia on health aapecta of ailoking.

Thia, of courae, iG a problem for the individual companies and wiill not be included in thia progr*w.   But it auet be recognised that aooc of the advertieing *ey have created a degree of akeptioian in the publio (ind which at tho atart at least could affect the believability of any public relatione effort, "4>^**.....*........""

i.   The figures of the Damon kunyon Canoer Fund-estimate in 1952 twenty-two thouaand deaths from lung oancer in the United States in an estimated population of over one hundred fifty million individuals.   The report in the New York Herald Tribune an of Sunday, December 18th, quoted the Dritlah Medical Society aa adviaing that there were thirteen thouaand cases of lung cancer in Great Britain last year*   kith Britain approximately one-quarter the aire of the united States, their incidence of lung canoer would be approxlaately four timet aa great as the united Statea,   What are the facta about this and what ia the incidence of climate f eto, in the development of lung cancer?

j,   Is it possible that England, with a larger percentage of lung oancer incidence, may possible have obtained thia result due to the faot that the tobacco for their cigarettes ia not treated in any way with casing?  Should the efficacy of casing used in the manufacture of American cigarettee be etttdied aa potsibly am antidote to the deleterious affects of tobacco, if any?

k.   With the extension of hman life due to miracle druge, etc, what la the percentage of the increase of luftg cancer, if any, comparable to other diaerna during the past ten years?

h,   Wnat may be the effect on the significance of atatiatical comparison! of more accurate diagnosia during the pant few years into apecifio causes of death?

to, What are the beneflta and enjoyment derived from emoking, both by scientific testa and by aeaaurement of emoktr reactions and attitudes?

n.   What are the smoking habita of long-lived diatiiuiahed public leader*?

Research to date ha* not- established whether smoking. * * is not causally Involved in auch diseases a* lung cancer and heart disease, despite efferte to make it fleam otherwise. Ihe matter remains an open- question  for resolution by scientists.

We <nust oontinue to call for more flolentiftc fact* - not Judnts or opinions bwied on inadequate aM conflicting evidence*

The I current situation preaents both a problem and. an> opportunity for tobaooo people: Beat can we beat go about restoring perspective in the face of a tu&jbr campaign against cigarette smokingt

We win cite the varloua research reports and. octenttfic views that give validity t^> our position. "

Fori example, a, recent artiolm in foe Journal of the American Statistical Assopiatloh- declares that the case agalnat smoking has not been eatabliehed.

In- frhis article, Profesior K. A. Srowalee of the Utdvmlty of Cfelcsgo

aaya that the statistical data support various theories. One is, of course,

i the smoking theory. Another theory, which he boMeves is the main alternative

to the smojclng, theory, is called the "genetlo" theory. Smoking may be a symptom

of a type of person, rather than a causal factor. As of now, we don't know

which, if Either, of these theories is correct, according to Professor Brownleo.

H is important that reaearch be intensified to investigate the "gehstic?

theory. Ii understand the Council for flobecoo- Reaearch plans to expand lta work

We deplore, however, the statement mad* laat year that the Government'* research is! designed to learn "bow" oigarette smoking produces certain diseases, not "whether" it produces them.

thia approach can be eharply Questioned, for two reason* t

1.    flhe question of "whether" is still c^ulte debatable in scientific cirolaa*

2.    Any approach whfich aaaumea that "the facta are now, in" presents a real danger!, in my opinion. Beeearehers acting tinder eucT. an asaumptlon amy lose eight jof what should be the objective of. all:   To conduct the research needed to ljeam why and how those disss*** are actually caused and what role, if any, tobltvccoand other factors may play.

To tnose who assume that the facts are now in, I invite attention to- a significant! recent' scientific report which raise* farther doubt* about             - '"3X8*$}}

smoking-lung canoer theories..

Zhlsj one was published in a British- medical Journal, the Lancet, by ftrs. Rieharji Boll and M. C. Pike.   ta. Doll's earlier statistical studies have been used to criticise smoking.                                                                       p i

Mb article, which eonftvm a previous study, shows i Among maskers who develop lunjs cancer the disease occurs at about the same age regardless of how much or hovj little tbey tasked in their lifetimes.

This] is significant because If smoking were actually a major cause of lung cancer! there should be a direct relmti-onebiP'botween th* dose (amount smoked) endj the response (age when the disease develops)1.   Putting It another way, If the j disease- Is due to cigarette smoke, it should occur earlier among those who stfioked more,   this research ahows this does not happen.

I believe the research reports which have been- cited will Indicate some of the cotnpjexitic* of the problem and some of the differing scientific views which exist*""                   ~~ ~~'~      '~ "i"                                     .                        " ""''

Th>y are examples of the kind of Information that explains why wc do not accept extreme judgments' about smoking.

Hsjavy- taxation of oigarette smoker* Is a matter of considerable concern, i lagitta&ta taxation is one* thing,  Excessive taxation that penalises! the smoking segment of the public is punitive.   In New York City, for example, federal, state and city cigarette taxes now add up-to 22 cents a packageL

Clarence Newman, of the Wall StreetJpurnal, Informed me yesterday  -.that ha 1* interested in dofn^f a slory on th* ^'confused ploture about tar and nicotine reporting," He asked if Brown t WiUinmeon could provide  spokesman to give the "industry1* side" (presumably what is being done In the v/ay of research, testing, end posture).  I told him I would diaouoe this with my principal*; he maid there is no greet rush, but he would-like t to have some indication of our interest a* soon a* possible.

In addition, I am reliably informed that a similar opportunity exist* with lllfpr. Magemtno.

Obviously; the key word ia "oonfueion," and anything wo can do to oonflrm much a situation could work to our advantage,- provided)

(a)  The current method* of testing ere shown to be fraught with nutneroue variables, and therefore give rise to misleading results;

(b)  The significance of "tar and nicotine" perse ie seriously questioned In terms of scientific Indictment and ''established" range* of hazard; and

(o) The tobacoo industry ie shown to bo a8 owning a highly responsible and active role in trying to clear up the confusion -in the publio interest. Thia would involve the disclosure of our ov/n plans for a testing laboratory, our initiative in offering cooperation to the FTC, our intention to do testing in a "glass case" stance, and our dedication to the most scientific procedures and skilled techniques In arriving at coaroplste rosults.

em*

By taking advantage of these opportunities, perhaps we can forcefully refute Header'* Digest's criticism (in the November issue) of the industry's "deeply ingrained flim-flam" in reporting the fact* about tar and nicotine content.

Tobacco Institute Comments on "Tar" and Nicotine Washington - The Tobacco Institute today issued the following statement ln| reaponee to inquiries concerning a forthcoming magasins article, and earlier published reports on die subject of "tar" and nicotine:



c

The increasing attention in recent weeks to the subject of "tar" and nicotine appears to reflect a conaiderable amount of misunderstanding and confusion about this subject.

While some scientists believe that "tar" and nicotine are harmful, other scientists do not agree.

Wa know of no valid scientific evidence demonatratlng that either "tar" or nicotine is responsible for any human illness.

Even those who maintain that smoking is harmful have not been able to establish that any particular ingredient in cigarette smoke eauses human dteease.

With respect to nicotine, the report on Smoking and Health of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee points out that "There is no acceptable evidence that prolonged exposure to nicotine creates either dangerous functional change of an objective nature or degenerative disease." The report goes on to state that nicotine "probably does not represent a significant health problem. "yt0**

There is no "tar" In cigarette smoke, and smoke Is not "tar." "Tar" la the name givsn to some of the components In smoke tihet can be collected by Moratory techniques.                 ^^ ^^ .

The growing emphasis on "tar" and nicotine can mielead and con-fuae the public inaofar as it suggests that science has established human health atgniflcamce for "tar" and nicotine* At best, such a suggestion is a matter of opinion and guesswork.

Former Surgson General Terry said in testimony last ysar before the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee:  "While it seems at leaat plausible that cigarettes with lower tar and nicotine may present lesser health hasards, there ia presently no proof that this is so."

Nor is there any scientific proof today that "tar" and nicotine has aignificance In terms of human health.

Scientists throughout the world are continuing to investigate to learn the full facta about "tar" and nicotine, and about questions concern* lng tobacco and health.   The tobacco industry ia supporting much of tills research and will continue to do so.

has already been created by otherwise well-meaning ' wai nines and advertisements," eaid Dr. Joseph Wolfe, a founder of the U.S. Committee of the World Medical Associaiipiv "As a result, a great, many people, par-ticula rly those who are impressionable,- have been tiaumatized with fear of disease which has resulted in a prevalence of unwarranted anxieties and jijju* loses. The effect jb harmful and, in my opinion, does moie damage,than good,**    ;!  .                !   ,,'

Nevertheless; a ftor SurgeonGeneral Lutber Terry's icopit asserted that "cigarette smoking is a health Jiazai d pf sufficient Importance in the United States to. wan a lit appropriate remedial action/' i the; Senate! and House-Committees on (Commerce held hearings for 16 days in 1965 to consider proposed legislation. Surprisingly, 39 of tl]e 49 medical authorities and statisticians who iesiified disagreed vigorouslyi with the import and charged fits firidiugs were "distorted; Only two of the dissenting experts were connected with the tobacco industry.               :>    ,    ..

The purpose of thp hearings, was to determine whether the Federal Trade; Commission should be given authority to regulate cigarette advertising. England r estricted TV ads iii J962 and officers of the U.S. cancer, heart and tuberculbsis aflsbciaiiphs urged Congress to, impose a ban hei-e and to tighten rcstric tions on iiewspaperand magazine ads;!        '   ;

Congress wouldn't go along; All it would agree to do was to require cigarette packages to be labeled with an ambiguous warning 'tltaj, "smoking may be hazardous.'* After the Surgeon General's strong indictment, ihis struck many as averymild p)n!asei;;:;  . j! :

Some people charged that political'wKeeling apd dealing was responsible for Congress's"seemingly!^inadequate action. Tobacco growing states do, indeed, wield a good deal of poXyeHn Congress, More than , 90 percent of the tob'Sccp ;|^pwn! in this country is pioduced by six state;&, NoVth|.iQarQliiia, Kentulcky; Virginia; So.ujh'., Carolina,' Tennessee' and Georgia,: But the fact is that only-two of the Senate Commitibe's 18 Jnenibere^^ we're.frbm those^tate8.and;;piity seven ' of the-33 members'bf the |fo^Ve;Cbmj^ji^*.v- :;.:::

TJ>mSMOKE OR NOT TO.SMOKE-THAT IS STILL THE QUESTION

[Conlmtd from pope %)

"The increase, in, lung cancer over recent decades gives not the least evidence ot being due to increasing consumption c>t! tobacco," lie declares, Sir XonaM sue-gestes.',ihiu sir pollution and genetic patterns-Inherited physical characteristics-may be the prime causes of canoer. As weshall see presently, the statistical assqeiaiipnbetwen these factors and the disease jit sponger than the connection ' with'dgawfie*,'Gut the Surgeon General's report glossed overUwse important clues.

Jiilicc the Vgu ment; ajjainst, cigarettes

, rests lately ort.stetistitt/ftjs illuminating

' to';&tiniirie sOme of the inconsistencies

n^! contradictions in the figures. For

example:

:  :Lnng cancer is rare in women. .The' male vt, female ratio today is' 6:1; in :19S0 it was 1.5:1, There h*s beeii a tit-meiwtpus increase in women smokers during ibla'st generation, but their death rate Jvc-m lung cihcer.has remained al-rnctst steady. This clearly suggests a sexual factor that makes men more susceptible 'loihc. disease.                  ....'=

  .Cancer of ilie Irkhca-windpipe-is '..very, rare. Yet this is the. area that gets

the greatest "exposure to tobacco smoke,  When lung ameer appears, in the overwhelming-nifljority of cases it is in tlve,lower parr of the lung which never is 'reached by smoke. A study made recently by the libs Angeles County Hospital, dating back to 1927, showed that cancer of the lung tubes, which get the lieaylcst dosage of smoke, has been stabilized iri recentyears.

  If smolcing.cause* lung cancer, heavy consumers c-fagajTttes:should contract it earlier than! nommokeri, They don't. The 'peak fpr the onset of the disease is between 67 and ti^-for chain smokers and people who never hove used tobacco. Further., .there is no; proof that die chances of getting cancer arc reduced by gi^g%sindk%     ....'

  Jflhn.ring should induce lung cancer if cigarettes ait hazardo.usvX'oc a scrappf evidence lias" been found to corroborate the: theory.  A : Irtish purvey ac;iuai|y showed thei*.sv*ere titWer: cancer victims tunong steady'Srihalers than hoiwtjokers.

The Surgeon Central's advisory committee had many reservations about the conclusions reached by Doctor Terry in die report. Shortly after it was published one member, Dr. Jolih JL.Hicknm, Lo1d tlie; North' Carolina Heart' Association: "The mpre: wp looked at the sti|tistia, the more difficult it; was lb understand. The picture ii iiot at all hi clear as the; numberi appear at first." ' Poctor Terry ivas in a tough spot. Like a district attorney confrontetf with, a shrill clamor to i0lv^ a scandalous murder, the heat was on him to! bring in a suspect tn the.fight HgaJtist dancer, the leading killer after heart disease iu this .country. People wanted some concrete results for the millions spent,annually on

Besides, Doctor Terry and his associates had a. mass of material which did seem to indicate that cigarettes were a menace. The figures showed thai the mor^; tality rate for male cigarette smokers hom ft?/causes was 70 percent bigUcr than for nonimokert.

Since the'p'iiie tobacco was Introduced to tvirope from die Am^lcati colonies 450(year&;.ago,! smoking-,has'becomqrari addiction throughput- ilVc! >ypfld. The liabitseenis to satisfy a need and have some tbei-apeuticvahie, There is no other explanation.for the. enormous popularity of smoking despite efforts to curb it. There never. Was. ii kid'who didn't feel nauseated' after sneaking the first; for-bidden pun pn'-s cigarette, yet thaf.unpleasant experience does not deter most Adults frojn,smoking eventually;,

There;' is wowing support:, among cancer specialists and psychologists for the genotype.theory advanced 80 years a#o by Sir kon'idd Fisher1. He maintains that, an individual's peculiar iconstitij-tion creates a craving foi'tpbaccoand the ..same chemistry makes him more susceptible lo lung cancfer'tlinn a nonsmoker, The kicker, though,: Is v that a heavy smoker is more likely to get. cancer if he is deprived of dgnrcttes which serve.jhe important function ,of relieving his/tensions; This Tevoliitip'n.ary concept, from a man of Fishbr's stutjire merited allien librf, bin the; Surgeon! General's report gave it "the oiice-over-ligtuty treatment: : "Thesignificant beneficial effects of smoking occur primarily in the area.of mental health, and the. habit!originates in a: search for contentment. Since no mean's of measuring the quality of these bentfiu.il itppareiit, the Committee finds no basis for a uidgiirent which would weigh benefits against hazards of smoking as it may apply to the genertd population/' In 'other words, since.'the benefits coiild not be measured, they were not considered,                  '   

A similar situation came up when hesirt specialists testified on the rehitipn-ship between smoking and coronary attacks. Dr. Henry Russek, formef; Ah rector of cardiovascular research And now a consultant; at the U.S. Public Health Hospital on! Statcli'Island, New York, told both Congressional tymmitiees: "After years of study jt!|(.my preserft be-; lief that corbhaiyaiMaseVis,not caused': by,the consumption of tofyacco... jEJuo-tiphnl stress, associated with Occupational activity appciirs fajrtiuirc signifieant'tbah he^ditv, .dietary fat,".tobacco, bbesity or physical .inactivity in"tlje development of heart, attacks;",    ''."'':(}" ''   ;:-j:::"

Psychiatrists, whoChave sttidicd; !Me prevalence; and persistence of tliesiiibk-ing habit are agreed it is. a carryover from', the ..first pleasure of Infancy,; the oral :satisfaction of sucking/'After an infant is. .\yganed lie' continue*.to'test every new object by putting' it in-his. .raoutlv then, in .childhood resorts' to thumb*utWn.g when he fc frustrated or Ured- Pulling on tobaccb serves much the

Some clues to this approach were reviewed, bytw. BemlceC-Sachsi then president oi the American, Medical AVomeii's Association mid an authority on psychosomatic medjeirie. ''Vykh every emotionand manhas somelttnd of emo-, tjon every mlnutc-d\aiges take place.in muscles, bipod vessels, in.the viscera, in ;the endocrine glands.;;,.

COPY OF AMERICAN CANCER\ jCIETY NEWS RELEASE ISSUED KArSJ 21, 1968 IN NEW YORK CITY

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Mew York, N. Y,  The American Cancer, Society today issued a detailed refutation of-a Tobacco Institute promotion claiming that "there is absolutely no proof that smoking causes human cancer,"

In its statement the Society congratulated the Wall Street Journal for exposing "the real source" of a "devious mailing" to tens of thousands of physicians, lawyers, school teachers and many others.

The expensive mailing Is a reprint of an article that appeared originally in True Maitatine and is entitled "To Smoke or Not To Smoke  That is Still the Question." The author is Stanley Frank, recently employed by Hill and Knowlton, one of the public relations firms for the Tobacco Institute.

In the mass mailing to physicians, teachers and others there Is no reference to the cigarette Industry role In the entire project.

The ACS declared:

"We had wondered who was paying the many thousands of dollars for this expensive reprint, for the lists of addresses of opinion leaders, for the first class postage.

"Now the American Cancer Society congratulates the Wall Street Journal for exposing the real source of this device mailing. It comes, according to the Journal from Tiderock Corp,, a second of the public relations firms employed by the Tobacco Institute,"

The Society charged that:

"What Is presented as a mailing to community leaders by the Editors of True Is now exposed as a massive propaganda effort by the tobacco Industry."

Mr, Frank names a small number of Individuals In science and medicine who claim that the case against cigarettes is unproved, but the Cancer Society points out that "by so doing, he gives.the impression that the scientific community is seriously divided In judgement." Mr. Frank fails to note, according to the ACS, that his "sources" constitute a minority  and an extremely small minority, at that-among those who have considered the question, The Society cites the "host" of organizations, both here and abroad, including voluntary as well as government agencies that have "indicted cigarette smoking as 'a serious health ha&ard.'"

Well-meant cooperation by True and the cigarette ""industry in the promotion1 of the article has been characterised *e deceptive by come of the above persons and organizations,' and in subsequent editorial comment in> , Advertising Age and other publications read especially lm advertisingi and public relations circles.

It can. be argued that these rebuttals and reactions have: been more harmful to the industry than if we had taken no

"action with respect to tbe< True article. Certainly Bill and Knowiton's employment of Mr. Frank and1 True1* change of: .

Tiderock is preparing to sample public opinio* In one city tentatively Indianapolison< the cigarette controversy, following this immediately with heavy institutional Tobacco Institute advertising for several weeks, with a subsequent remeasurement of public opinion. From^this,. given forthright copy pegged squarely on, the> issues, we hope to learn (a): more: about our ability to communicate without causing "flak"' which leaves us, worse off than before, and (b) whether we can* bring about a greater awareness that the cigarette controversy is not a closed question. Tiderock should expedite appropriate and careful copy preparation- and' industry executives should lose no time in approving It-

' /  The scientist who has been' associated with more research in ',

tobacco end health than any other person declared today that "there li

no demonstrated causal relationship between,smoking and any disease,

"The gaps in knowledge are so great that those vbo, dogmatically assert otherwise - whether they state that.there is or It not such a ' causal relationship - are premature In Judgment. If anything, the pure biological efidence is pointing away from, not toward, the causal hypothesis."' ,

The statement was made by Sr. Clarence Cook Little, Scientific Director of The Council for Tobacco Research - U.S.A, on the 15th nni-vertary of its founding by tobacco grower*, warehousemen and manufacturers.

Dr. little said that scientific progress in the smoking and health field, supported in large part by the Council, has shown that --

"1. The genetic makeup of the Individual largely determines his susceptibility to cancer, cardiovascular disease or chronic respiratory disease which stay appear after exposure to various environmental challenges.

"2, Many factors other than smoking are significantly associated with cancer, cardiovascular disease and chronic respiratory disease,

'3. statistical associations between smoking and lung cancer, based.on study of those two factors alone, are not proof of causal rela* tionship in the opinion-of moat epidemlolggists.

g^OKINQ AND HBAI/TH PROPOSAL

What we want to do this roorniog in. to take a summary look at the -smoking and health question and then make, a proposal to you for a B&W project to counter the anti-cigarette forces.   T

This is a chronological table of smoking and health activities.  Not all the activities by any means.  We have been a elective i .making up this chart Juetpicked those eventa that caused.headlines to be made and ' probably left strong impresBions with the public, Aa we look at.it I believe Wttsaneee how we became an harassed and rjeatricted industry and how we came to conflict with the awesome Jbrees of the federal government

It ia alao a aort of key to the charaeteHatioB and proceaaea involved in . the smoking and health njiestjton, lookiog at the individual elements we eee... (comment),;

To aummariie. the arrtt-cigarette activities I think wa can Bay that: Hret - they have managed to brinf ui from a atmple ^oonfUot of attltudea. to a stale o condemnation and  severe restriction.

Second - Their efforte liave been age*eealye while, ours have been defensive.

Third - The antt activities are rather orderly -- almoin as if they had o plan working for tham.

NEW YORK  The Tobacco Institute declared today Uiat the American Cancer Society fs withholding significant data from scientific scrutiny In connection with an experiment which the Society claimed resulted In production of lung cancer In dogs with cigarette smoke.

Pointing out that the American Cancer Society said that the tobacco Industry should reassess Its policies on the strength of this * experiment, the Institute disclosed It had called upon the Cancer Society to permit an Impartial scientific review of the underlying date.

At a news conference Joseph F. Cullman lr6< chairman of the Institute's executive committee and chairman of the board of Philip Morris Inc.', disclosed that the ACS has turned down two requests from the Institute to release the pertinent experimental data to a panel of expert scientists.

The experiment Involved nearly 100 beagle dogs, most of them forced to Inhale cigarette smoke through surgical throat openings, at the Veterans Administration hospital at East Orange, N.J, It was financed by Cancer Society and federal funds. At a Waldorf-Astoria Hotel news conference last February, ACS announced that a number of the dogs, Including two d-f eight which did not "smoke", had devoloped lung tumors.

Mr* Cullman said the Institute told ACS It was prepared to establish an impartial scientific review panel and to bear*any costs of their Investigation. The Society could reject any member of the panel for good cause, he noted.                                                                        ,.

He pointed out that the Society, supported by public donations, has an obligation "to Its contributors and to the public at large to provide complete Information about the research which It finances."

He added; .'.'If the Cancer Society does not accede to my request, we plan to use every meant at our disposal to see"to It that the medtcal and lay public are made aware of our respective positions In this matter. Furthermore, we Intend to continue to press our request for exposure of this experiment to Impartial scientific scrutiny by qualified experts In the manner suggested, If the Cancer Society continues to deny access to the work, I believe this will serve as convincing evidence to the public, lay and scientific^ that the Auerbach-Kammond data will .not support the allegations made at the Society's Waldorf-Astoria conference,"       ,                                                                                        ...

TheTobacco Institute beliefs

the American public is entitled to

complete^authenticated information about

cigarette smoking and health.

TheAmericanCancerSocietydoesnotseem to agree.

h th* public entitled to com* plete. authenticated Information about researched cigarette tsnoking and health? The Tobacco Institute thinks li is; the American Cancer Society apparently think* it b not

The Tobacco Institute hai recently challenged the Cancer $ocl< e ty on a matter of importance to the public-lnd the public health. The Cancer Society hat not accepted this challenge.

On February 5, the Cancer Society called a prett conference in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City to discuss a research project titled, 'The Effects of Cigarette Smoking Upon Dog*.* Through the efforts of the Cancer Society, the public we* Jed to believe that this tuperimint ii a landmark achievement which, for the first time, demonstrate* that long caaeer. reset** btiag lung cancer in humans, can be produced in animals with cigarette smoke.

Tne Cancer Soeietyclalmed that this result refutes the contention of the tobacco industry that there is no laboratory proof of a connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. The Society ik aald that the finding! should have an impact on dgeiwtte smoking and should result in a reassessment of the adver-

tising claims and policies of Ihe tobacco Industry.

The tobacco Institute does not -and the public should not-acoept these claims at face value. Here are the reasons:

I. The present accounts of this study are based solely upon information and Interpretatlorri provided to the press. The study has not been published in any scientific Journal. The findings were not subjected, as such findings Donnelly m, to rigorous independent scientific review.

& This Mstory of tobacoo end health research contains many examples of experiments which were initially hailed *t scientific breakthroughs, but on later evaluation proved to be of little significance. Unfortunately, the initial and ore-maturt announcement of these ex* pwimenu makes news, but the later criticism of the work rarely comes to public attention.

3. The Tobacco Institute has requested the Cancer Society, in writing, to permit a thorough independent evaluation of th* expert-meat and its results. We said we would propose  reviewers men of outstanding competent! and integrity, with wide experience in areas relevant to the data, who, wt believed, would betijCjWJghJy aegfpt*

able to the Society, We also *tated that if the Society should, for good reason, reject any scientist we propose, we would nominate a substitute. Finally, we ofttrtd to bear all costs needed for this Independent analysis,

The CanccrSociety has twice rejected this propouMo letters dated March 12 iftd April 17.

We continue to hope that the American Cancer Society will permit the examination of this work in the manner we have proposed. If tbc Mod? b ti Important as the Cancer Society has represented it to be, tht Society should hive no hesitation in submitting if for review.

The tobacco ladostry raeognltei and accepts a responsibility to promote the progress of Independent scientific research in the field of tobacco and health. In discharging that responsibility, wt believe that the industry has spent, and continues to spend, more money for such research thin any orginitatlon in the United States.

If the Cancer Society continues to deny access to this recent work, wa believe this will serve as convincing evidence to the public, lay and scientific, that the data will not support ihe allegations made at the Society's Waldorf-Astoria conference.

In retrospect of the November 30 meeting, of the CTR Executive Committee, tt might be appropriate to comment on-the question "Wnao kind of CTR program Is best for the Industry?" At the meeting it was apparent this questiom Is troubling many elements of the Industry to the extent people are reluctant to discuss the subject openly because of the diversity of views, To some extent this unsettled state also exists within Fhllip<Morris.  In the hopes of clarifying, at leasB partiality, the matter I offer the following, summary, hastily adding that these states ments embody tdeas from many places.

1.  Stated Objective or Purpose of CTR

"To aid and. assist research into tobacco use and health, and to make available to the public factual information on this subject". Thlis Is: a very broad; statement which* has been interpreted more narrowly to "providing financial support for research by Independent scientists. .?" "to provide significant data about lung cancer, heart disease, chronic respiratory ailments, and other diseases." (196&V69 Report of the Scientific Director, C.T.R.-U,B,A.)

A broader CTR program Involving the mechanisms of contracts as well as grants and areas of research pertinent to-health,, other than 3trlccry biomedical, is. no: excluded by the statement of purpose:. The narrower Interpreuaclon indicated above must stem either from ilndustry policy guidance or from the strong medical orientation of che: Scientific Advisory Board.

in any case, this statement of purpose does not reveal the objective need of the Industry In supporting the CTR program.

2.  It has been stated that CTR Is a program to find out "the truth about smoking, and health." What Is truth: to one Is false to* another.  CTR and the Industry have publicly and frequently denied what- others find as "truth." Let's face It.  We are Interested: tn evidence which we believe denies the allegation than cigaret smoking causes disease,  if the CTR program is aimed l<n uhts direction, it is In effect trying to prove the negative, that cigaret smoking does; not cause: disease.   Both lawyers and scientists will agree that this task Is: extremely difficult, if not impossible,

3.  What them are the alternatives?" Somehow all caveats and platitudes aside, we must assume chat CTR exists tor the good of the Industry.  How could this benefit be achieved?

Option A.

Aim the program at contributing to the search for the causes of diseases, especially those: diseases alleged! to be caused by smoking.

human welfare and alleviation of human suffering; therefore, the public should love and respect us and buy our products.

Rational 2

Wuh more research there Is a good chance the smoker-related diseases wilt be

found to resuk from causes other than smoking, and the Industry is "off the hook."

Problem 1

Wa total national health research effort of 1, 000 million dollars, what Impact

will our contribution have? Is it even worth PR value?

Problem' 2

Assume we; target projects related to specifics, like lung:cancer.  Will our 2 to3 million dollars have any effect? Probably not.  The: national cancer research' effort today totals over 200 million' dollars.  Besides, how do you judge high-return, worthy, viable fields of work for support? Too many investigators have selfish interests for us to take their judgments at face value. No matter what or how we select, prospects for a positive benefit are small.

Option B.

Use the CTR program as a means of establishing- expert scientific witnesses who will testify on behalf of the Industry lit legislative halls, in litigations, at scientific meetings, and before the press and the public.

If this objective is the purpose of CTR, them a very Umlted* selective grand1 program should be adequate to do the jobv  There would be l'ittle need for research contracts or an- extensive staff In headquarters:. One might also question how long it would take for the witnesses to acquire tihe "taint" of industry money.

I cannot judge the Ifaigatlve value of this approach, but, I am tmpressed by the legislative testimony we are able to muster at Congressional hearings.  On me other hand, my contacts with scientists outside the Industry do not reveal an* extensive awareness of, or appreciation for, the CTR program. It would be interesting co try to measure such awareness by the public, the medical profession, or by scientists at large.  If after 16 years and 20; million- dollars such' a study comes up with a: blank, as l think It would, then wecan only conclude that CTR as presently organized: and operated Is not convincmg:the pubWc that we are objectively seeking the "truth" or "establishing good' faith In the scientific, community."

OpplonC.

Aim CTR research at the discovery of information' of use and value to the clgaTet Industry.

Rational

there are many unresolved questions relating cljgsret smoking no the smoker. Research on. these problems would help us to-understand better our product and our consumer. The results of such research appHwl to our business would undoubtedly help us overcome some of the criticisms we are facing.  These topics are not new.

2.  Psychosocial studies on the positive benefits of smoking as revealed by smoker behavior patterns:.

The way to earn the approval and respect of che- scientific community is to carry out and publish good research.  I don't think we get much credit for this by giving grams.

It would seem appropriate to explore in some depth during, the "next year or two how CTR is or might be serving the needs: of the cigaret industry. The disparity of opinion on thits subject within the Industry Indicates that the answew to the question Is not obvious.  If we (members of the Indusory) cannot convince ourselves of a'definite answer to the question "HOW"", then we mljght very well decide It is wasted effort. If so, CTR should be termInatedv

A tobacco industry spokesman said here today tha "face of Prohibition" has entered the smoking-health controversy.

Horace r. Kornegay, president of The Tobaeco^fnswtute, told Chicago notary Club members at lunch in the Sherman House that "for the first time the true motives of the anti-smoking crusade have surfaced. People are getting a look at its face. And it is not pleasing. The face of Prohibition never la."

He feinted out that the U. 8. Surgeon General haa called for a ban of crooking in publio places, and said a United Nations group recently declared that "smoking ahould be an activity limited to consenting adults in private."

"The- spirit ia pure Carrie Nation," Kornegay said.

Cautioning against what he called excessive critic ism of American biainess, Kornegay pointed out that tha oigarette industry has regulated itself by volunteering to end i,ti broadcast advertising, and to include HtarM and nicotine information and a Congrestionally-authored health warning in all its advertising.

"But," he asked, "did that satisfy our leading foe in the Senate, Senator Moss (D.-utah)J It did not.*

He iaid Moss is continuing a "violent attack on the tobacco industry," and that "for one who prof as sea to promote self-regulation, Senator Moss is doing a masterful job of kicking it to death."

Kornegay said that what he called "hysteria" about smoking "resuLts from the tenacity of the cancer mystery whioh is a challenge to the entire nation,."

He said "many eminent scientists who are workers in the field agree that the question of smoking and health is still very much a question. And so apparently do millions of Americans who continue to srnoke, despite an almost incessant campaign of fear and eKhortatiwi.w

Kornegay said that "individuals and organiations which are morally convinced that the elimination of cigarette smoking is the simple aolution to a very complex question feel frustrated by anyone's unwillingness to accept thalr judgments."

FOR RELEASE FEBRUARY 26, lliOO A.M.

Little RockJ. C. B. Ehringhaus, Jr., vice president and counsel for the Washington-baaed Tobacco institute, said her* today that the 1972 report of the Surgeon General to Congress on smoking and health "insults the scientific community" and that "the number dne health problem is not cigarette smoking, but is the extent to which public health officials may knowingly mislead the American public,"

Speaking at the Arkansas Wholesale Grocers' Association, Inc., annual meeting, Ehringhaus said the recently released raport la "another example of...'press conference science'an absolute masterpiece of bureaucratic obfuscation."

Ehringhaus lashed out at the smoking/health report on various counts.

Ha said the Surgeon General "ignores by misrepresentation the researchers

I. whose contrary findings he chooses to omit from the report."

As for the allegation that smoking has deleterious effects on pregnant women and their unborn children, Ehringhaus pointed out that a recent American Medical  Association full page newspaper ad flatly statedi "The rate of infant mortality has dropped 25* in ten years."

Ehringhaus noted that a "new section" of the report dealt with allegedly hazardous effects of smoking on nonsmokers. But, the tobacco industry representative said, just thrte days after tht rtpoxt's release

the Surgeon General went on television and saidi "The real pro* blem is that...even in a crowded room, or an automobile, we can't measure the effect of the trace chemicals upon the nonsmoker."

Ehringhaus noted that oigarette tax collections in Arkansas for 1971 amounted to more than $27 million. Federal excises on cigarettes for the entire country came to $2.1 billion that same year. Altogether, he said, 51 percent of the price of a package of cigarettes is represented by excise taxesa grand total approaching $5 billion yearly.

SUBJECT! The Roper Proposal

GENERAL COMMENTS

It is my strong belief that we now have an opportunity to take the initiative in the oigarette controversy, and start to turn it around.

For nearly twenty years, this industry has employed .9. single strategy to defend itself on three major fronts  litigation, politics, and publio opinion.

While tha strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed over the years helping us win important batt 1**, it is only fair to say that it is not - nor waa it intended, to be - a vehicle for victory. On the contrary, it has always been a holding strategy, consisting of

 oreating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it

~ advocating the public's right to smoke, ^..                              without actually urging them to take up

';:' ' -     the praotioe

gfl .tftff Utfaaftion fjcon,ft for whioh the strategy wai designed, it har been successful. While we have not lost a liability case.  this is not because juries have rejected the anti-smoking arguments.

On the political front, the strategy has helped make possible an orderly retreat. But it is fair to say.that it

has not stemmed the pressure for new legislation, despite the major concessions.we have made.

On the Public opinion front, however, our situation has deteriorated and will continue to worsen. This erosion will have an adverse effect on the other fronts, because here Is where the beliefs, attitudes and actions of judges, juries, elected officials and government employees are formed.

THE STRATEGIC IMPASSE

As an industry, therefore, we are committed to an ill-defined middle ground which is articulated by variations on the theme that, "the oase is not proved." As the reaent history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam demonstrated, it is impossible to hold the public on a middle course for any length of time. There seems to be no way that mass publio opinion oan engage in a controversy and choose an answer that goes beyond the range of either/or.

In the cigarette controversy, the public  especially those who are present and potential supporters (e.g. tobaooo atatft congressmen and heavy smokers)  muct perceive, understand, and believe in evidence to sustain their opinions that smoking may not be the causal factor.

- As things stand, we aupply them with too little in the way of ready-made credible alternatives.

THE ALTERNATIVES

Two such credible alternatives existt

i.e.' people who smoke tend to differ importantly from people who do not, in their heredity, in constitutional makeup, in patterns of life, and in the pressure under which they live.

2) The Multifactorial Hypothecs i.e. as science advances,, more and more factors come under suspicion as contributing to the illnesses for which smoking ie blamed  air pollution, viruses, nriH/fl\T (\(\fV7K*\'}

food additives, occupational hazards and stresses.

Our 1970 public opinion survey showed that a majority (5256) believed that oigarettes are only one of the many causes of smokers having more illnesses. It also showed that half of the people who believed that smokers have more illness than non-smokers accepted the constitutional hypothesis as the explanation.

Thus, there are millions of people who would be receptive to a new message, stating 1

Cigarette smoking may not be the health hazard that the anti-smoking people say it is because other alternatives are at least as probable

The Roper Proposal would be a persuasive (if not strictly scientific) medium for this message , which we have done little to develop in a systematia or comprehensive way.

- Following is my outline of the steps required to start a shift in publio opinion if the Roper Proposal is accepted.

A SCENARIO FOR ACTION

1) select a panel of experts to consult on the design of the study. Ideally they would be prestige figures who would initially have a solid contribution to make and who would also be willing to endoree the study publialy at a later atage.

2) Conduct the pilot study.                                                              ,

3) If favorable, present the results to carefully selected members of the following key groups 1

Senate

House

Cabinet                                       *

White House        t

The purpose is two-fold (a) to gain the support and participation of friends and (b) to neutralize any adverse action they may be brewing. For example1 By seeing Secretary Butz at this time we might gain some degree of participation from the Agriculture Department. By seeing Secretary. Richards on we might possibly forestall a PHS anti-smoking drive,

4) Conduct' the full scale survey.

5) If the results are favorable, release them as

a book in both hard cover and paper baok version,  hopefully published by a legitimate house. In effect, such a volume would be a counter - Surgeon General's Report. Th principal authors would be Burns Roper and an eminent research scientist. The advisory panel hopefully broadened as a result of Step 3  would write the introduction. The industry*a funding role would be fully acknowledged.

6) As a book the material would be marketed and promoted in all the many ways avallablei magazine condensation, TV and Radio talk shows, newspaper reviews and interviews, advertising, gift distribution, etc. etc.

And beat of all, it would only have to be seen  not read  to be believed...just like the Surgeon General's report*

Dear Mrs. Fine:

Thank you for your letter of Hay 30, enclosing letters written by Members of your second-grade class requesting information on smoking and health.

The tobacco Industry Is most concerned about the charges being made that smoking Is responsible fcr so many serious diseases,   Una before the present criticise began, the tobacco Industry, In a sincere attempt to determine what harmful effects, 1f any, smoking might have on huiwn health, established The Council for Tobacco Research.   The Industry also supports research grants directed by the American Ifedical Association.

Despite all the research going on, Lied leal science has not found my conclusive evidence that !t element in tobacco or tobacco smofco causes any huwan disease.   The answers to the mny unanswered smoking and health questionsand the true causes of human diseasescan, wo believe, be determined by scientific research.  Our Company Intends, therefore, to continue to support such research until the truth 4s known.

I trust that these comments and the enclosed materials Kill help you to understand our position on this matter.

SMOKING/HEALTH

An Age-Old Controversy

This article, reviewing the development of the smoking-health controversy and outlining the current state of the issue has been prepared by The Tobacco Institute, an organization formed by members of the tobacco industry in 1958 to disseminate information.

As early w the first httf of the 17th century, King lame* I of England ailed th* use of tobacco "i custom loathsome to the eye, hateful to the nose, Wmful to the brain, dangerous to the lungs.*-                                    *'"              *- - "   "

And In the same period, one Or. Roger Marbecke, In  work entitled "A Defence of Tobacco," recommended imofrmg in moderation at beneficial.

Thus, one tcholar, noting the divergent views, labeled them "thl beginning of the tobacco controversy."

Once launched, there appeared no ttopping the controversy. Through the years debate continued and charges against tobacco became to strong that In IBS? one publication observed... If Its (tobacco's) evil effects were so dreadful f stated <he human race would have ceased to sadst..."

Of course, the human ce didn't cease to exist It survived and brought forth Lucy Gaston Page, who with her followers went around early In this century snatching dgarettea out of the mouths of men.

During the 1920'i the No-Tobacco League of America was asking . . . "Will Tobacco Be Prohibited?"; complaining about ihe amount of money the tobacco Industry spent for advertising on billboards and In papers and magatfnes and predicting ,,, "the tobacco business Is doomed." And Into the SB's the controversy tumbled.

Obviously, then, the controversy is not new. The question Is, what makes the tobacco/health Issue of the latter half of the 20th century different from the previous onesf

No Single Amwer

There is probably no single answer to that question.

One major difference is the mast comrramlarJoni system that flashes newt to every comer of the countrydairy, hourly, and sometimes instantaneously.

What story could have wider appeal than one that talks about health concern of every Americanand links that subject with a custom as widespread aa smoking} Tens of millions of smokers will be Interested. So, too, will many millions of non-smokers and antkrrtokersl

That ii what happened late In 19S3 when widespread publicity was given a report involving cigarettes. The article told of laboratory experiments In which tobacco tmoto condensates were smeared on shaved backs of mice for practically their entire lifetime. Nearly half the mice developed skin cancers at the site of the s In painting.

A big difference soon developed in what these mulls meant to scientists, how they were Interpreted In sensational news stories and how they were Interpreted by antKfgarette groups.

Mice or Men

One scientist calculated later that to achieve a comparable dosage In human lungs, i man would have to smoke something like lOD/Wrj cigarettes daily. Then there's the obvious fact that

mice aren't men. Results on mice can't be Interpreted tn terms of whit could happen in man. Also, It hti come to light that .a ood many substancesIncluding certain sugars, citrus fruit 1 "attracts, and even eggs and teacan produce cancers In mice. This, is scientists observe, meant that there's something wrong with the mice, not with the substance).

"Smoking Dogs"

Another "sensational" report came nearly two decades later. In February, 1970, at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York, the American Cancer Society announced a "scientific breakthrough"' when It released research results to Indict cigarettes as a cause of cancer and, according to the ACS, to close tha case against cigarettes.

ACS said two researchers, Hammond and Auerbach, had found tung cancer In 12 beagle dogs who participated in a cigarette smoke Inhalation experiment

The Tobacco Institute asked ACS to let an Independent, scientific review board examine the full experiment dataIt reoafved i categorical nol Th# study was turned down for publication by two major medical jotim*l and was finally pub. fished in another Journal ten months later. One of the study's authors was on Ihe editorial board of,the journal that published the experiment

Also, with no valid explanation, the published paper said only two dogs had been found with mlcfoccople-stefd lung cancer the original report claimed (wefve dogs developed cancer.

More Scientist*..? More Knowledge

This points to another major difference between the current controversy and those of the past Medical science is more advanced; scientists are more numerous; many are Intent on studying the major human Nineties, which are of a different order of importance than they were even half a century ago. Infectious diseases, which used to cut short man's average life span, are largely under control. An Increasing number of people live longer ana eventually die from mainly heart-related Ills or cancer of tome (Ire.                            '

The average age of death today in Ike United States Is around 70, compared with about 45 at the turn of the centuryan Increase tn life span of some 55 percent This hat changed approaches on many medical problems,

Abo since the turn of the cenfcjtry cigarette smoking has grown rapWr/' Today more than 40 million Americans an dgirette smokers.

Sdenttsts today also turn more attention to epidemiological studles-whtdh mean, In brief, the aludy of large populations of people to see what kind of illnesses they have and then trying to see if there Is anything else In common among people with tame illnesses.                             ,

At that time the Society launched an epidemiological study fnvotving cigarette smokers, conducted by a Yale statistician, Hammond, and a psychologist, Horn. The latter today heads up the government's anti-smoking programs, and the former Is a vice president of thl American Cancer Society.

News Flashed Across Country

In fune, 1954, a preliminary Hammond-Horn report was given at the American Medical Association's annual meeting in San Francisco. Great secrecy preceded the report, although lengthy press releases were prepared in New York end carried to San Francisco where the first results were announced at a press conference. The news flashed around the country.

The report said, in brief, that certain causes of death, Including lung cancer and heat disease, appeared to strike dgarette smokers with greater frequency man non-smokers. "Cause and effect"--it was said, although later reports wen to talk about "associations" and are was taken to avoid the direct charge of cause and effect relationship.

But that was much later, The Implication In Ihe news storiesand especially the headlineswas strongly that cigarette smoking was responsible

Only months later, too, did other scientists have a chance to evaluate this report in published form and comment One severe critic was Or, Joseph Berkson, i blometrlclin at the Mayo Clinic Dr. Berkson is not only a doctor of medicine, which Hammond and Horn are not, but he is also  leading medical statistician.

Doesn't Agree With Indlclment

Dr. Berkson wrote that the Hammond-Horn report raised significant questions calling for research, especially In the* biological field. But he did not go along with th* Increasing numbers who were claiming that the case against cigarettes as a cause of ailments had been shown by this report,

Or, Berkson's comments carried additional weight because he was a member of the Cancer Society's statistical committee which had helped to develop the Hammond-Horn study.

Guilt by Association

Other scientists raised questions about the lack of knowledge and about the ever-growing campaign to indict cigarette* on 

{uilt-by-astoclatlon basis. These objectors were often muted ecause they did not make positive, sensational statements did not Indeed often rite in defense of cigarettes but rather In defense of applying a scientific approach to the problem, rather than one of condemnation.

The question involving cigarettes had hardly been rafted In the early 1950/s before the tobacco Industry Itself announced its determination to p'ut the problem into the hands of scientists to seek an answer, Representatives of leading manufacturers, of grower groups and auction warehousemen announced In January, 19S4, th* formation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and pledged continuing fundi for research Into all aspects of the questions of tobacco use and human health.

By mid-year, the problem of developing research policy and making grants to scientists was in the hands of a Scientific Advisory Board, made up of recognized and Ind pendent doctors and scientists, with many years of experience on health problems, especially in the field of cancer.

Soma may have thought answers would be quickly forthcoming. But the scientists, many with decades of research experience, knew that much patience and time would go Into trying to team the secret of what makes a living, controlled cell turn Into the wild, uncontrolled growth that Is ailed cancer. Similarly, research required to understand the basic cause of various ardir>visCularcommonly called heart-diseases would be long and arduous.

... the baste causes ot cancer and heart disease stilt elude medical scientists year alter year; old theories are discarded, and new ones tested.

Causes Still Unknown

Today these wise older heads have been proved right. With all the burgeoning research efforts of private groups, of the federal government, of scientific agendas, of medical associationsthe basic causes of cancer and heart disease still elude medical scientists year after year; old theories are discarded and new ones tested

Viruses, for example, were hardly bejng considered back In 1954, Today some leading cancer authorities are convinced viruses may be the ultimate villain. But they haven't proved this yet.

In heart disease, many factor* of modern life are under investigation, and scientists argue amohg themselves whether the major suspect in cardiovascular disease Is stress of living, or diet, or imoking habits, or Inherited weaknesses, or the chemistry of cholesterol, or hypertension, or pbesity, or what!

Support Research

Meanwhile, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was reorganiied In 19M as the Council for Tobacco Research-USA, but with the same objectives emj i continuing Scientific Advisory Board to set research policy arid programming. About $40 million has been pledged through Its program and to the American Medical Association's Education and Research Foundation and to other Independent researchers. The tobacco industry's commitment h this area is greater than that of any government agency or of all the voluntary health associations combined. There have been many scientific advances made but the problems are still unsolvedas they are for the rest of the cclftntific woild*

The latest and largest of the Industry research grants was that pledged to Washington University In St touis In 1971, The In-dustry awarded M million to back t n)rw uncer immunology study headed by two world famous researchers.

During these years of scientific effort report after report has been Issued by various groups mterprfting research so as to implicate cigarette smoking In some of, the diseases for which the causes ire still being sought

These attacks on tobacco use, often repeating previous charges or stating them in new words under new auspices, stirred up various groups to try to "do something" through legislation or regulation,                           '

Need to Communicate

The industry recognized that, In addition to sponsoring research, there was need for an action and information organize- -tion. In 195B The Tobacco Institute wits formed by dgarette, smoking tobacco, chewing tobacco and; snuff manufacturers to deal with general public problems of th* Industry. One of the specified functions of The Tobacco Institute was to collect and disseminate scientific and medical Information relating to tobacco, and this has continued to be done, in various ways, In the years since.

The basic nature of the data used against cigarettes scarcely changed Essentially, it is the same or similar to that reported In the original 1954 Hammond-Horn study-that is, statistical association studies,

The late Sir Ronald Fisher, who was called the "rather of modern statistics," was, Ifke Dr, Berkspn, critical of drawing conclusions from these statistical studies. And he was not Impressed by the number of them. Sir Ronald said In effect

0121525

that if one of these studies does not permit certain conditions, you can't change this merely by repeating the same type ol study XKodd times and getting, expectedly, the same results. They are, he said, "mere repetitions of evidence of the sime kind, and it is neary to try to examine whether that kind is sufficient for any scientific conclusion." Sir Ronald said It was not

Relied on Statistical Association

Yet thb is essentially whit has been done. The 19M Report of ihe Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health, a major government pronouncement on smoking, relied almost entirely on seven statistical assodatlon studies for arriving at conclusions that have been widely used in anti-smoking campaigns.

Annual follow-up reports by the Surgeon General beginning in 17 did essentially the same thing, They went further In attempting to indict dgarettes in connection with heart disease or child-bearing, for example, They were prepared by the National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health, an agency which is spending more than two million tax dollars yearly to campaign against cigarettes.

Evidence More Confused

It fs significant that an Independent evaluation of the epidemiological, or statistical, research on cardiovascular disease, for Instance, came to a different conclusion. Published In the Jan. IS, 1968, loamtl ol ihe American Med/caf Awodation, this evaluation by Prof, Carl Seltzer of Harvard University concludes that the evidence involving cigarettes Is, If anything, mora confused than it was in 1%4 and does not permit the condujltm that there Is a causal relationship.

Back In 1954 certain leaders In the American Cancer Society announced their intention to enlist other agencies In the campaign against dgarette smoking. Though progress was slow at first (the American Heart Association refused to endorse 11957 report about dgarettes), gradually over the years a number of organisations have gone along, to a large extent convinced by the statistical evidence which the Cancer Sodaty and others have amassed,

In 195S, an official of the Cancer Sodety developed a master-plan against dgarettes, which said among other things that "some legislative action is indicated" and that the campaign against dgarettes probably would not be successful If carried on onh/ by the cancer group, He said: "The greater Ihe number of diseases for which true cause-effect relationship an be demonstrated, the stronger would be the cat* and the more successful the campaign" against the industry.

The combined efforts of the anti-smoking forces Culminated in the decision by the President In 19(2 to have special report on smoking and health.

Industry Position Clarified

Because of mounting criticism of the industry, Tobacco Institute officials in 1963 sought to clarify certain policies and practices of the industry. The Industry's position that smoking is an adult Custom was emphasized by guidelines from the Institute relating to eliminating such advertising and promotional practices thai might be construed as appealing to young people.

In 1964 dgarette manufacturers established a Cigarette Advertising Code with former New jersey Governor Robert Meyner as

If one study does not permit certain conclusions, you can't change this mere* ly by repeating the same type of study 20-odd times... Yet, this U essentially what has been done.

The anttanoktnjjt efforts have not succeeded in making America a "nation of non-cigarette smolcen)/' the admit* ted goal of many of the anti-smoking advocates.

'-------'-'-        ........       t--------......................

administrator. The need for the Code at a formal administrative entity has passed, but many of Its requirements continue to be observed by cigarette advertisers. The dfAe set up strict rules against youth appeals in advertising and, agilnst health claims that could not be backed up.

Under Governor Meyner's dmlnlilretiorV all college campuses and publications became "off-limits" to cigarette advertising, television eommerdals were restricted *i Io content and program placement to avoid reaching large children audiences, and eommerdals by prominent figures were not allowed

But the T9M Surgeon General's report opened the gates to Federal legislation, a 196S act which called, for the original warning label and a 19/0 act requiring the one now on all dgarette packages. The legislative history shows jhat the Intent of this was to alert consumers of a possible health haiard for some people.

The report also blued the trait to further prohibitory legislationthe radio-TV advertising ban on dgarette advertising, effective tanuary 2, 1971, Also, late 19ft) saw the Industry's voluntary move to display *tir"-nlcoline:content, and In 1971 its decision to depict cigarette packages; legibly showing the warning language, In all advertising.

Smolcen Aware of Warning

A, 1%7 report to Congress included * government survey finding" that 93 percent of all smokers wr* fully aware of'the warning label on the packages. This was. before th* saturation campaign on television by the adversaries, of dgarettes.

Despite this warning label and despite the repeated smoking attacks reported In the press and on radjo and television, the anti-smoking efforts have riot resulted In making America a "nation of nort-dgarette smokers," the admitted goat of many of the anti-smoking advocates. In fact, the, government reported' that dgarette consumption in 19/0 and ei(iy 1971 had Increased significantly.

As might be expected, this has led lo many other proposals to restrict the legitimate merchandising lof a product desired and used by million of adults throughout, the world.

Thus, in 1971, the industry is faced again with combatting a well-organized campaign that has as Its goal the eventual abolition of cigarettes, and perhaps all tobacco.

Problems Industry Faces

Here art some of the problems, capsuled, the Industry Is facing;                                                             :

1.   An effort to require that a much stronger warning message be carried in all advertising, Marry In pHvat* business would oppose such punitive action against the [tobacco Industry, because In addition to being unjustified, such controls could easily spread io other Industries.

2.        Federal Communications Commlision ruling that anti-smoking propaganda can continually be aired even though dgarette eommerdals art banned from mdic-TV, and disallowing any required airing of contrasting vi*H In 1967 the same commission required that cigarette commercials had to be offset by intl-dgarette announcements.

3.   Suggestions to put progressive taxes, on cigarettes, related to the "tar* and nicotine measurements. The ever-Increasing state excise on cigarettes will go even higher (f today's trends continue- State legislators are making it very "Inconvenient" for consumers to purchase  legal product

Other Differences Considered

Much research going on during this controversy has developed Information that (km not support the charges against smoking- Among major developments have been findings that the basic constitutional make-up and lifestyle of smokers, as a group, may vary considerably from those people who don't become smokers, Tht differences might very well account for the differences in susceptibility to certain diseases, according to some studies. This would account for th* statistical atsodations on which most of the anti-smoking charges s/e based.

Research findings of this type lake a long time In developing and do not always get sensational attention, as they are reported with considerable caution.

Important studies of pairs of twinswho are much alikeand of large community populations have recently shown, in connection with heart diseases, for example, that when all factors, Including genetic factors, are considered, the apparent assoda-tion with cigarette smoking seems to be greatly reduced or eliminated,

Can't Identify "Harmful" Substance

In all the research that has bean going on, no study has reported finding any substance as found in dgarette smoke that causes human lung cancer or other disease Those who glibly talk about removing "the harmful substance" often overlook the fact that not even the dgarette critics on name "the harmful substance." It is a fact that all of the diseases with which smoking has been connected also occur In non-smokers. And this leaves a pu&le unsolved: what causes non-smokers to get diseases which are claimed by some to be "caused" by dgarette smoklngt

Industry Supports, Cooperates

The tobacco Industry has consistently held the position that it would extend Its scientific research support to cooperation with tha government In studies of baste health problems and all the factors that may be Involved.

Those who glibly talk about removing ''the harmful substance" often overtook the fact that not even the cigarette critics can name''the harmful substance/'

The Industry does not go along wlih those who would claim the "issue Is settled" and shut off all discussion on the controversy.

The tobacco Industry believes th* American publicall elements, induding sdentistshave k right to hear all the facts Involved In this controversy, not just those advanced by Ihe anti-smoking groups. The Tobacco Institute has prepared several television and radio public service messages now available for use by th* broadcast media, for twample.

Rather than letting debate be shut off on this controversy, as some advocate, the tobacco Industry caBs for two major actions:

First, Intensified and cooperative research to git th* scientific facts on the health questions, rather than reJylng on "guesses," assumptions, and suspicions;

Second, more attention to not Jiist sensational charges and jaxzy anti-smoking slogans but also tjte doubts and uncertainties that are accumulating about the extremist anti-smoking charges.

Public Will Decide

Ultimately, It will be on the basis of all the facts that the American public wilt make its decision. At issue Is whether those who dedde to smoke will hty the Sam* freedom from government Interference as have those who dedde not to smoke.                                                  ,

That's how It am* out In the 17m century, In the 19th c*ir> tury, and In the first half of the 30th century. Will It come out that way In the last half of the 20th century!

Tfte facts and1 statements in this document are presented by the Tobacco Institute in the belief that the many controversial questions concerning smokingand health must ultimately be answered by further scientific research end new knowledger>d that full, free and informed' public discussion h essential in the public Interest             .-

TO:   Mr. C. H. Judge FROK: A. W. Spears

Before attempting to discuta CTR, a brief review of the o)reani*a-tions contributing to research into tobacco, and health" seems to be "" appropriate. Perhaps the simplest way to review the subject is to list the organizations and/or category of organisation and general areas of research which they are pursuing.

1. Harverd Project - effect of awoke on host genetice and lung function; especially, lung defense mechanisms as mediators of bronchitis and emphysema.

2 Washington Pnivarsity - early detection of cancer by immunologioelmethods} and function ot the immune system in tumor regression and/or prevention.                                                                       '

3.  VCLk - macrophage morphology and function differences between smokers and nonsmokers. Cancer immunology, early diagnosis through cell culture methods and canoer chemotherapy.

8.  University of Kentucky - broad spBctrum of chemical

and bioassay development programs. Epidemiology into smoke dose , obtained by smokers who enter hospital and those that do not.  Primary enphasis seems to be tumorigenesis and chronic pulmonary disease. Program does include agronomical aspects.

9.  USDA - program is concentrated on new varieties, curing process# etc. as means of manipulating tobacco. Program utilises NCI bioassay systems and chemical analysis of smoke.

10. State AgricultureResearch - program relates to pesticide residues and breeding tor low tar and nicotine..

11* Tobacco Sheet Manufacturers - attempting to Ktake tobacco sheets with improved laibassay results. Utilising NCJ and German Institute for bioassay.

12. NCI and HTsXl - programs relate to development of bioassay system for tobacco smoke. Evaluation of different products by these bioassay procedures is prime part of program. Emphasis is on tumorigenieity, nut programs for cardiovascular disease and chronic pulmonary disease are being initiated.

13.' Rd Hoc Committee -most research is epidemiological in nature. Program is primarily aimed at seeking alternate hypothesis of disease causation.      

14. CTR - epidemiology, bioassay development, genetics, primarily"aIjTied at tumorigenesis and chronic pulmonary disease, but same activity in cardiovascular disease and smoking motivation.

Exclusive of the CTR program, the total annual research, funding of the listed organisations is on the order of 25 million dollars directly related to smoking and health. Additionally, ,,..the federal government is spending on the order of 700 million "' " in 'the general disease areas of oanoer, chronic pulmonary disease and*cardiovascular disease. Clearly, CTR is conducting research in a highly competitive area, and the programs must be well conceived and targeted to avoid unwanted duplication and produce

Sometime ago (1970), the CTR program was evaluated by the Research Directors. At that time, it was felt "that the desired aims of the CTR program oould be stated est

1.  To define the effects of cigarette smoke on the human system.

2.  To conceptualize and explore other hypotheses relative to the smoking and health question by epidemiological and other appropriate

methods.

, Mr. C. H. Judge

3. To define motivational mechanisms of smoking, using laboratory animal models as well as ,._....... human populations.    .....

Following the Harvard funding, B * W suggested that CTR be reorganised and redirected. Their suggestion was basically to expand efforts on the, motivational aspects of smoking and to become supportive of Harvard in other areas pt research* 'They also proposed that the scientific director of CTR be supported by an advisory board and specialised staff members. They proposed a working group for overall coordination consisting of Harvard Scientific Directors, CTR Scientific Directors and industry representatives.

i- .:-> ..From what has been said to" .this point, .it. seems, obvious that a multitude of research organisations are Involved in the area of smoking and health research* Additionally, U.S. sponsored research into the disease areas associated with smoking are two orders of magnitude above, industry spending. Previous suggestions for narrower research aims of CTR have been reflected in their recent program, but overall coordination of industry sponsored research has not been achieved. * It is also apparent that coordination or at least planning information must be obtained front as many as a dozen organisations if duplication ie to be avoided and intelligent planning of short and long range objectives are to ba accomplished. Also, it is apparent that numerous organisations are newly involved in chemically and biologically based research toward product modification. -The most obvious of these in the'U.S.  are MCI, the USDA and The University, of Kentucky.

Historically, .the joint industry funded smoking and health research programs have not been'selected against'Specific scientific goals, but rather for various purposes such as public relations, political relations, position for litigation, etc. Thus, it .seems obvious that .reviews .of such programs for   :.. scientific relevance and merit.in the smoking and. health- field are not likely to produce high ratings. In general, these . programs have provided.some buffer to public and political attack of the industry,, as well as background for litigious strategy. However, the public and political attitude toward smoking has seriously decayed with respect to the tobacco industry, and scientific and political attack has become intense, with efforts at forced product modification underway. Thus, we see the litigation threat of much lesser importance than .that of legislative and public acceptance of cigarette smoking. This suggests .that goals should be defined more on the basis of scientific aspects, public relations and the programs leading to such goals coordinated more by business and scientific management.      .....

. Mr. C. H. Judge                                  - 4 -                            June 24, 1974

We see no way to coordinate without an organization and responsibility to coordinate.

The writer believes that only two mechanisms exist for this coordinationt (1) a working committee of industry representatives and (2) appointment of one individual for that purpose# with overall program and fiscal responsibility.

In the past, and currently, the Committee approach is in effect being used (Committee of Council). However, representatives of the Committee generally lack the background to bring about scientific coordination and the time to bring about management coordination.

It is suggested that CTR be combined with the Tobacco Institute administratively, and that an industry committee along with the staff of the Institute and CTR be designated to help define programs. It is further suggested that the programs at Harvard and Washington university be brought under the same committee, and the Scientific pireotor of CTR. In addition to providing structure for coordination, we believe that more efficient use of information for public relations and legislative activities is to be gained and reductions in administrative and legal fees can be effected.

In looking specifically at the CTR program on a financial * basis, as shown below one is struck by the fact that approximately Sit of the budget ie associated with cancer related studies. Certainly, one would like an analysis of how much of this work is distinct from the 500 million being expended by MCI and the overall and specific objectives of the CTR research in this area. Another 18% is being expended in the area of lung and pulmonary disease. Again, what are the objectives, and how do they relate to Harvard and all other organizations, particularly Harrogate? Approximately 111 of the budget is associated with cardiovascular research, and of this only 441, or St of the total budget, is directed at arteriosclerosis. Approximately 3.51 of the budget is devoted to motivational research, and 5.6% in epidemiology covering the three major disease areas. A miscellaneous category appears to be generally supportive of the other activities, and represents 11* of the budget.

From a review of the individual projects under the cancer heading, one can reasonably describe the experimental objectives.

1. Investigate the factors, AHH, immune competence,strain, {2 viral infection, Vitamin A, etc. as mediators of the carcinogenic *b response to chemicals in the small animals.                                                      f

This booklet is presented by Tho Tobacco Institute tn the belht that full, free and informed discussfon of the smoking and health controversy Is In the public Interest, end In the conviction that the controversy must be resolved by scientific research.

Preface

For many adults, cigarette smoking Is one ol life's pleasures.

Does H cause illnesseven death? No one knows.

" The esse against smoking is based almost entirely onlhferences from slalistlcs. The "conventional wisdom" about smoking came from judgments expressed by committees of doctors in England and the U.S. In our country, anti-smoking organizations pressured the government lo endorse these Judgments, Never before (or since) had a committee "discovered" a single "cause" for so many diseases.

A number of respected scientists do not believe a causal relationship between smoking and illness has been established. Others believe that ft has.

if smoking does cause disease, why, after years of intensive research, has It not been shown how this occurs? And why has no ingredient as found In smoke been Identified as the causal factor?

SmokingHealth Statistics

Statistics are said to show that among the 60 million Americans who are smokers, some may fall victim sooner or in greater number than other people to three major types of ailmenls cancer, diseases of the heart and circulslory system, and the pulmonary Illnesses, emphysema and chronic bronchitis,

These happen to be our greatest medical problems, coming to the forefront es the major infectious diseases of the past were "conquered" through scientific research, There have been other coincidental trends, among them the g rowth In popularity of cigarettes.

Scientists call these heart and lung problems "degenerative" ailments, for they seem to develop very slowly, through soma kind of distortion or breakdown of body mechanisms. Though each illness is very different, all three~~snd moreare blamed by some sources primarily on one factor, cigarettes.

Laboratory Work

We hear about laboratory "proof" that smoking causes cancer. Mice have been painted, hamsters swabbed and rats injected with "tars" condensed from tobacco smoke in laboratories but not found in the smoke itself. Rabbits have been red nicotine. Dogs have been forced to "smoke" through holes cut In their windpipes. Subsequent "changes" in various cells of these animals have been cited as evidence that cigarettes cause disease, though production with smoke of human-type lung canceror heart disease or emphysemahas never been verified in laboratory experiments.

tt Is no wonder that an American Cancer Society official has said that "a clever enough researcher can make almost anything induce cancer In animals, our his findings may have no relevance Io human exposure"

Somehow it's possible, the argument goes, thai direct exposure to tobacco smoke can damage cells in the respiratory tract, The human heart is not exposed to smoke, and so there is even greater guessing about how it might be affected.

The Problems of Guesswork

Simply blaming cigarettes for heart disease doesn't help. In some countries not even statistics fit that notion. The government's National Heart and Lung Institute points out that we've .teamed so much about how to treat heart ailments that we overlook how little we know about their cause*. "We tend to obscure our Ignorance," the Institute says, "by making It seem that a problem has been solved when It has, In (act, bean only half solved."

Emphysema, which makes breathing difficult, is a kind of lung damage typically found In older persons. Doctors ponder whether, among other things, it might be caused by Inhaling some substance or whether It might result from some blood circulation difficulty. In any event, and despite speculation that smoking has something to do with it, the official view of the government institute responsible for lung research remains candid: "We do not know the cause of pulmonary emphysema, how tc stop its progress even if detected early, or how Io prevent heart disease caused by emphysema,"

Those who consider smoking a menace, rather than an enjoyment, have acted as prosecutors, trying to convince the public they have an airtight case. But isn't the "jury" entitled to some serious doubts? For example:

  Smoking cannot be the sole cause of any illness, because in every case nonsmokers are afflicted loo.

m Research suggests that because a patient tells a doctor he smokes, he Is more apt to be diagnosed with an ailment "associated" In the familiar statistics with smoking.

  Those statistics themselves are shaky, In cases of fatal illness, causes are verified by autopsy in only about one-fifth, As one expert says, "meaningful mortality statistics can be assembled only by analysis of postmortem observations, not by guesswork, no matter how educated the guesser."

 At the same time that increases in lung cancer have been reported, new techniques and equipment have made it possible to Identity more cases with certainty. Thus statistics can help suggest the Incidence at any given time, but they are of doubtful value in telling us the incidence et one time compared with another, or what the rear* trend Is.

  Too many conflicting reports are Ignored In the anti-smoking messages from "authorities." For Instance, the American Heart Association warns about tobacco but doesn't remind us that in Japan, where the smoking rate is much higher among men than In the U.S., the heart disease death rate is far fewer. Or that the U.S. rate has been fatting for the past 15 years in the face of increasing smoking.

sf We ere told that more people have begun smoking at younger ages, which suggests to some that illnesses associated with smoking should appear sooner. Yet the peak age for

lung cancer stays right around 60 and, if anything, may be moving to older ages, a While women the worfd over have long since joined men In cigarette smoking, the lung cancer rate In men Is Inexplicably higher: About a 5 to 1 ratio In the U.S., 2 to 1 In the Philippines, 16 to 1 In Finland, 15 to 1 In the Netherlands.

Such observations, needless to say, do not exonerate cigarettes. Yet, drawing conclusions against cigarettes Is equally unjustified.

Have you heard these canards?

"300,000 people die each year because they

smoked."

"100,000 doctors have given up smoking."

'"Smokers have black lungs."

Where do these ritually repeated claims come from?

Take the "300,000 deaths" charge. One government official said years ago that such an estimate would Involve "making so many assumptions" that tt might ba "misleading."

Yet, a year later, a former advertising executive who just doesn't like smoking announced that cigarettes cause 125,000 to 300,000 deaths a year.

Another government official agreed, claiming smoking was responsible for af least 125,000 premature deaths a year. He acknowledged getting the figure from the advertising man.

So the advertising man was asked in a Congressional hearing where fie got his estimate.

His reply. From the government! The government man tried to justify it. He took some arbitrary percentages of the annual deaths from various ailments, including several which were not even claimed by the Surgeon General to be causally related to smoking!

Later, the Surgeon General himself undertook Io explain the 300,000 figure. He did this by:

1.   Taking as his basis the unsupported estimate above.

2.   Adding to It another unsupported 102,000 deaths"from diseases where the relationship to cigarette smoking, while not so obvious, is nevertheless clearly Indicated."

3.   Adding to this another unsupported but "reasonable estimate" of 60,000 excess deaths for smoking women, who had not been included in the earlier estimates.

Nobody took the trouble to expose this silly game, or to point out thai the "authorities" considered nothing but smoking In comparing ihe longevity of one group of persons with another. But scientists, quietly aludylng twins, made a significant contribution. Let us see what happens, they reasoned, to people with Identical genetics and different smoking habits.

What Scientists Found 

By 1970 there appeared a study of Swedish identical twin pairs with differing smoking habits, including cases where one twin didn't smoke at ail, There was no association between smoking and higher overall mortality. Later similar findings were reported among Danish twins. But tobacco's foes still repeat that number 300.000. A simple, rounded, large, impre*slve-~and meaninglessstatistic.

What about those "100,000 doctors" who have quit smoking? A government bureau coined the slogan, "Maybe they know something you don't." This is supposed to scare us. too.

Well, that figure came from a government-sponsored mail survey of 5.000 doctors. After several foltows-ups, including phone calls, the survey people heard from only a third of their sample 5.000 and of rnose a third said they were ex-smokers. So Ihe government people multiplied the whole U.S. doctor population (about 300,000) by ona-thlrd, and claimed 100,000 had quit smoking!

The Truth Comes Out

Don't blame yourself It you can't follow this. It makes no sense. The "survey" Itself was never published, A disillusioned government agency spokesman recently confided:

''We never did finish It. There were too many errors In it, so" many errors that we couldn't do a thing with It, Every time you turned a page there was an error..,, It waa a waste of money, but, what I object to more, it was a waste of time."

No matter. The 100,000 number, so carefully manufactured, no doubt will endure!

What about the third canardIhe so-called "smoker's lung"? Can a doctor really look at lung tissue and tell whether it came from a smoker? Not long ago. a president ol the American Cancer Society testified before Congress that this is possible.

Well, said an expert to the same Congressional committee, "I would estimate that of 1,000 pathologists in this country 998 would say, 'I could not tell,' and the other two would say, 'I could tell,' and that those two who could telt either had

some divine intuition or were not telling the truth."

Said another pathologist witness: "It is not possible, grossly.or microscopicaly, or In any other way known io me, to distinguish between the lung of a smoker or a nonsmokei."

Later, to illustrate an environment story, a medical news weekly tried to find a "clean lung" photo to contrast with Ihe darkened lung ol a 48-year-old man who was born and died in New York City. Said the magazine: -Only by photographing the lung of a four-month-old infant who died of epilepsy did we find the expected contrast."

Smoker's lung? Yes, you'll hear of tt now and then, even from Ihose who should know better. it's handy, just like Ihe "300,000 excess deaths" and the -100,000 doctors." But ills hardly truth.

Thus have critics of cigarette smoking conducted themselves, adopting aggressive positions, reaching lor the most sweeping and dramatic claims, often beyond statistical or scientific fact.

Smoking and Women

You've become accustomed to seeing magazine and newspaper articles which say that smoking can harm your unborn child, Studies do show that smoking mothers, on the average, ghave slightly lighter weight babies. Yet with, more Women reportedly smoking, inlant mortality rales keep reaching historic lows, Some studies have shown that the lighter babies of smoking mothers actually have better survival rates than similar weight babies of nonsmokers.

A suggestion that smoking may not be the cause of slightly lower weights among newborns came from a California sludy of more than 13,000

8

mothers. Some of tham began smoking after their first pregnancies. The babies tney bore before they were smokers also tended to be lighter in weight,

Thus, there may be other, more significant differences between groups ol smoking and nonsmoking mothersage, economic status, employment, race, diet and many other characteristics that could affect the outcomes of pregnancies.

Many Contrasts

Smoking and health statistics have been built up by comparing smokers and nonsmokers. But when large numbers of people are sorted into two groups this way, are there no ofnar differences between them? Differences which might account for contrasts in health patterns?

There are, indeed, say authorities who have studied such things. Some of them are surprising.

Smokers "generally are more communicative. They are more creative, more energetic, drink more coffee and liquor, marry more often, prefer spicier end saltier food. They take part more in sports and change jobs oftener. They are more likely to have parents with heart disease and high blood pressure!

These and olher lindings, accumulating in the medical literature, raise the question of whether smokers may have higher illness rates because ot the kind of people they happen to be.

Science has learned that a blueprint of our constitutional, physical and chemical makeup is laid down at the moment of conception. This Is genetics and, as the saying goes, we cannot choose our own grandfathers. The blueprint is still fuzzywa do nof know, for example, the

extent to which our genes may map our actual behavior and choice of lifestyle, and how these in turn may affect our relative well-being.

Research, said a 1974 Congressional committee report, "Is making great strides with the discovery of genetic factors in the predisposition of people to fall victim to certain diseases." Lung cancer and heart disease were among those mentioned,

The committee noted that recent research has shown, for example, that some persons produce In their bodies an enzyme whose activity Is highly associated with lung cancer. One pathologist has said this could explain why there are people who "don't do anything that would be considered conducive to cancerand yet they develop cancer of the lung at age 50, There are others who smoke three packs a day .., and they die at 90 of something else."

The Congressional panel said certain genes have been discovered to be present in some persons that cause blood disorders leading to heart attacks and may account for a fifth of all attacks in persons under 60.

Similarly, there's been a recent discovery that some people lack a biological factor which, when present, helps protect the lungs from emphysema. Whether this deficiency is more common among smokers isn't yet known.

The Nonsmoker

Some persons who believe smoking is harmful lo Ihe smoker have also Jumped to the conclusion that tobacco smoke harms the non-smoker. There has been considerable investigation of the questionand here are some of the results:

  In California, the Public Utilities Commission was asked to ban smoking on buses. But after a hearing the Commission said, "there was no testimony that the average nonsmoker's health is impaired by exposure to the smoke produced by a nearby smoker."

 In Washington, D, C the Civil Aeronautics Board was asked lo ban smoking on airplanes. Instead, the Board formalized the airlines' arrangement to seat smokers and nonsmokers separately for their mutual comfort, citing a U.S. government study that concluded, "in-halation of the by-products from tobacco smoke generated as a result of passengers smoking aboard commercial aircraft does not represent a significant health hazard to nonsmoking passengers."

  In England, a medical committee appointed by that country's leading anti-smoking group, Action on Smoking and Health, concluded in- 1973: "There is no evidence that other

' people's smoke Is dangerous to healthy nonsmokers...."

Scientists^hive conducted many experiments to measure any effects of smoke on nonsmokers. They've carefully analyzed the eir of "smoke-filled rooms," looking for "pollutants," under extreme conditions rarely if ever found in a normal social situation. They've shown there is no valid evidence to justify a claim that the health of non-smokers is harmed by smoking of others.

Yet some persons would like government bodies to adopt new laws or regulations lo curb our right to make our own personal decisions about smoking.

In this case, Ihe solution seems clear: Personal courtesy, thougtilfulness and tolerance by both smokers end nonsmokers; e few simpiervoldh-tary practices in special situations; and respect for individual freedom of choice.

It is human nature to want to assume some things we don't really ftnow. Certainly that has been the case among many people who have had something to say about smoking and hea|th,

But that is not the spirit of science. True scientists make assumptions only for the purpose of testing them, proving or disproving them.

In that spirit, notwithstanding the easy answers some people claim to have, scientists throughout the world continue to seek the frulft about smoking.

Both the U.S. government and the U.S. tobacco industry are probably the largest sponsors of such research,

Over iwo decades, since the beginning of their joint program, our tobacco companies and growers have committed some $50 million to help independent scientists and research institutions who are seeking the truth.

in many years, their commitment has exceeded the government's.

And there are "no strings," no industry control, Every research grantee is encouraged to publish his results in the scientific literature.

Since 1954, the Council for Tobacco Research, guided by its independent and expert Scientific Advisory Board, has awarded about 500 grants and contracts totaling almost S30 million to 221 medical schools, hospitals and other research institutions in tha U.S. and five other nations.

In a ten-year program begun in 1964, some $15 million in tobacco industry funds, administered by the Education and Research Foundation of the American Medical Association, supported 222 smoking and health research projects in 87 institutions,

More recently, there have been three additional, major projects sponsored by the Industry.

12

In 1970, Washington University at St. Louis announced a $2 million tobacco industry grant for the study of immunologic (actors in cancer.

In 1972, Harvard Medical School received a $2.8 million lobacco grant for a major Investigation of pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases.

In 1974, ihe University of California at Los Angeles was given a $1,7 million Industry grant for research on lung defense mechanisms and early deteciion and treatment of cancer.

Elusive Answers

Throughout these years, answers have been slow in coming, and paradoxically, theories about causes of illness have broadened as a result of research sponsored by fnany different sources. Heredity. Stress. Behavior. Air pollution, Viruses, Occupational hazards. Immunology. Thinks we eat. Things we drink. These and more^as well as the hypothesis that lobacco is at fault, occupy the interests of inquisitive scientists tod a?.

As one of the world's leading scientific journals, Nature, said in a very recent editorial;

"it is the mark of the successful ecientlsi that he has rich enough an taiagrnstjon to look for ... alternative hypotheses, particularly when the conventional one Is popular."

At Mr. Goldsmith's request. Dr. Seligman, Mr. Holtman. and I met with Br. Gardner, Dr. Hockett and Mr. Hoyt at the CTR offices in New York, The objective was to review the contracts carried out by Microbiological Associates, namely, contract 14 and contract 25. It is contract 14 that earlier concerned Osdene. This was reviewed in detail by Drs, Gardner and Hockett. Essentially the contract was started in 1973 Kith the following goals: (I) Deliver fresh smoke into the lungs of an animal: (2) Make use of strains of mice which may be susceptible or resistant to carcinogensj (5) Study the biochemical parameter of the susceptible mice. Progress has been made on all of these fronts and definition of the project was explained by Dr. Gardner. I found that overall the technical approaches to the project, while not always consistent, seem to make scientific sense. Nevertheless, I would strongly recommend that tighter control be exercised over the proliferation of this contract.

Finally, the discussion centered on the human studies involving AHtt which is handled under contract CTR-MA2S, The objective of this study is to standardize the AHH determination in humans and then to determine people who aTe at risk for lung cancer. It is my opinion that the human is exposed to so many multiple insults, all of which may have a profound effect on the levels of AHH, that it will not be possible to establish a cause-effect relationship. Furthermore, even at this time, it is unknown whether it is desirable to have high levels or low levels of AHH. or their ultimate fate in the production of lung cancer. Thus, I believe that even if a standardized test is perfected for the determination of AHH in humans, its use could well be manipulated to obtain simplistic deductions on cause and effect relationships. It is my recommendation that CTR cease to work in this specific area of human studies.

Dr. Seligman brought up the grant by Dr. Abood in which one of the stated alms was to make a clinically acceptable antagonist to nicotine. This goal would have the potential of putting the tobacco manufacturers out of business.

You will remeubor Mr. ftelmawi's letter dated \Decembor 6 to Add Yeaman. Tlie letter took strong exception to tho program of directed, contract work under which tho stuff of CTR plans and directs tbo research. Heimann says . cut should be a grantor organization and nothing more. In ' Heimann's view, CTR should nke grants to reputable scientists who aro exploring areas of interest in the smoking and health controversy and tho grantees, as opposed to CTR, should be responsible for the plan of research. It is a distinction without much difference but American embraces it warmly ' nonethelessf. .-:*'.        ,, ..        ,,..   .../.-. ;.

It is possible that a new role for tho SAB might oomo out of tho current discussions.

One the budgot Is approved and the BAB has been sounded out by Add and Churl lo Bottmers, who will seok their cooperation In establishing better techniques and practices at CTR consistent with tho boat possible science, it is envisioned that the soientifio Liaison Downittoo will bo convened, lb at Committee, as you know, has a number of disciplines and attitudes ropresontod including research and development, public relations, legal and one CEO (Curt Judge), It is the proper place to tako up the general question of what '.

Once the CTR situation has stabilised a careful review of tho overall priorities and goals of industry rssearch certainly is in order.

The first step then Is the approval of the oormanent budget : > and some contact by Add Teaman and Charlie sommera with the SAB to assure that tbora Is full and complete communication between staff and SAB is receiving stuffiolont information to enable then to advlss and help plan the molsntlfic program  at CTR. When matters have settled down at CTR the question |tof rethinking Industry research goals should bo put to an 'appropriate group representing tho various disciplines as suggested above.                         .    .,.'"

Attached la a atatemont by Bill ehinn concerning the value of Council for Tobacoo Research. Bill *ntlons two aspects of particular value in CTRi (1) the. direct legal protection derived by brown * "Nllllaraeon and (2) tho politloal and publio relations advantage accruing to the Industry. With respsot to the fomer, he mentions the Monroe case involving XOOL cigarettes. Kith respect to the latter,*we wight Mention the surprise hearing Congressman John Moss has called for October 5 on tobacco industry smoking/health research. Drs. Bill Gardner and Bob Rookett nay teatlfy at that hoaring and will be able to toll about 23 years of work and also be able to an ever natters like the AMA-fcRF report which Hoes la expressing sons interest in.

Turning to litigation value, Mr. Monroe propounded an Interrogatory to *H asking what ve had done to keep abreast of the science concerning our produot. Our reply tells about the ten imminent. scientists who serve on the BAB in an advisory capacity at CTR and it tells about the grants which CTR has made over ten yeara. Stated another way, our answer says CTR is our window on the world of smoking and health research.. This avoids the research dilemma presented to a responsible manufacturer of oigarettes, which on the one hand needs to know tha state of the art and on the other hand oan fcot afford the risk of having lnhouee work turn sour.

blggett is now involved in juat such  problem. Liggett filed an Arthur D Little report in support of an application for a patent. The pAtent olaima that a oatalyat added to tobaooo blend reduce* the tunorlgenloity of the total particular matter, i.e., 'tar" when spread on the baoka of rodents. ,The Charlotte newspaper got a hold of the patent application and contended on the front page that for tho first . tine a oigarette company had oonoeded laboratory proof of causation between oigarettes and cancer. Of course there are a lot of answers but it's the kind of debate one would prefer not to enter into. (The best answer is we have known for twenty-odd yeara that "tar* painted on tho backs of animals, which are deliberately bred to produce tumors, will produoe tumore. Indeed, vitamin C will produce tumors under those oiroumatanoea. It is Hockett*s ensweri the wrong material, tho wrong tissue, tlie wrong animal, etc. Man is not a rodent.)

The point here is the value of having CTR doing work in a nondireoted j end independent fashion as oontraated with work either in-houa or   pi

under DAW contract whioh, if it goes wrong, can beeoroo the aroekftig pistol in a lawsuit.

You.way also want to refer to the note of February 11, 1977, to you and Dr. Hughe on this subject. A copy la attached to this memorandum. It is pointed out there that CTR provides a yardstick by

Which to meaaure an^K challenge the claims made tgainet ue on the thesis of other reaearoh reporta. furthermore, the more fact that CTR now haa over two decades and 046 million worth of experience behind it ehowa that there ie a real controversy hare and that the industry is in it for the long haul, at leaat until real answera ere found to take the plaoe of Hammond's statistical guesswork.

tt)ett . Recommendations for LongTerm Plans for CTR

After soma twenty-five years of existence, CTR as originally' structured may have outlived its usefulness, especially in the arena of P.R. As a consequence, it is recommended that the following restructuring be undertaken:

1.  Future plans and programs should be relevant to the needs of the industry.

2.  CTR should be controlled both legally and scientifically by representatives of the Industry. Implicit in the above, the SAB should be constituted with a Majority

of industry members. Several outside members (but not a majority) should be nominated to the SAB. These member* should not have access to CTR funding.

3.  CTR should fund work largely by means of contracts, thus reserving the right to control publications which might be detrimental to tha Industry.

4.  The CTR staff should ba more responsive to Industry needs and should report frequently to the new SAB.

5.  The long-term scientific progrsm should be carefully planned such that the results obtained should not be able to harm the industry. Recommendations for scientific program will be given later,

6.  Consideration should ba given to whether CTR should establish its own labs.

7.  There should be a greater participation by industry scientists in contracts and/or grants given by CTR. This should include site visits, interim monitoring of results as well as disposition of final results*

In addition there should be sore complete feedback ** to tht industry sponsors.                                                           Q

Th current meeting was called to help an ad hoc committee,, selected by the chief executives of the tobacco industry, do long-range policy, planning in. regard to smoking, and health, On the ajl ijoc committee are representatives of legal.,, public relations, and research executives; of various companies. Any long-range plans which' are developed are to be made known to the individual companies through their chief counsel. The ad hoc committee is to consider policy questions in general and particularly grants, contracts, the fate of CUR, etc.

As ft means of; Introduction, Bill Shinn described the history, particularly in relation to CTR. CTR began as an organisation called Tobacco Industry Research Council CT'IRC), 1't was set up as m industry "shield"' in- 195*. That was the yoar statistical accusations relating, smoking to diseases: were leveled at the industry; litigation began; and the Vynder/CJrfthBin reports were issued. CTR has helped our legal counsel by giving advice and technical information, which was needed at court trials'. CTR has supplied spokemen for the industry at Congressional hearings. The monies spent at CTR provides a baas for introduction of witnesses.

Bill Shlnn feells that "special, projects" are the best way that, raoades are spent. On these projects, CTR has acted as a "front"; however, there are times when CTR: has been reluctant to serve in that capacity and in rare instances: they have refused! to serve in that capacity.,

CTR began to lose their luster in the aiid-601 s and the tobacco industry looked around fOr more beneficial ways to. spend their research dollars on smoking and health. It. was a* this, time that; special projects were instituted at Washington University,. Harvard University, and WCLA, Bill Shinn noted that the industry received amajlor public relation "plus" when roomies were; given to Harvard Medical School. Re oto* the: First and Hind! publication on the exposure of the nonsmoker to: tobacco smoke was beneficial

to the Industry as was Lacy's (Washington University) letter to: Senator Morse commending the tobacco- industry for its support of basic cancer research, at Washington University.

Major problems exist today because of the advanced! ages of most members of CTR's Scientific Advisory Board CSAB). it; is felt that they would be of little use as witnesses today because they oould not withstand the rigors of cross-examination.

Getting away from the historical story, Bill1 Shinn mentioned that the "public reflations" value of CTR must be considered amd continued, Also product liability has to be defended',, therefore, the industry should' not take any action which will dilute the caution label on cigarette packages. A very interesting point, made; by BilU Shinn, ls; the opposition's, "the case is cHosed with regard to smoking and disease.11 Therefore, they will not spend any more money on health research, but will be willing to spend dollars on education to prevent youngsters from smoking; and to< disoouraga current smokers from coatlmidng to smoke. It is extremely important that the industry continue to spend, their dollars on research to show that we don't agree that the case against smoking Is closed., During the course of hiis remarks, Bill), Shinn said we might nee& to have "baskets" into which' research projects can be categorised and supported, There is a "CTR' basket" which miist be maintained for WPRV purposes. There are-projects to be funded, on reaearch aimed at. understanding the nature of various diseases. There are; projects which deal more directly with tho diseases purported to be caused by smoking and there a^e projects which must be done for specific obligations. It is interesting that this: proposal by SJiinn Is somewhat in line with the thinking; we had1 planned to present to the Committee later on in the day.

Janet Brown, felt that there were, and still are, benefits from CTR: being able to claim they are doing "free research'" even though it is clearly recognissed their support comes from the tobacco industry,

Jim Bowling added a bit; to the history. The TIRC was first established at Hill and Nolton PR when the government began to take action against the industry; i.e., the Blatnik Committee hearing. The Tobacco Institute was split out of the TIRC! each to handle its own function  eolenoe versus public opinion. Jim noted that in the past the industry has been very; successful because; it has been, able to recognize and. anticipate trends of both the government and the publio; thus, when government action actiyiity takes place;, the industry was prepared to. react immediately.

Ernie Pebbles noted that in the deliberations of *he M hoc committee;, the needs of TI have to be met. Arnold Henson remarked that suits have been renewed against the tobacco Industry but the thrust of the claims are now toward addiction! and drug dependence.

Bill Shinn, comments that the ad hoc committee should be a broad policy making committee and not. Just a smoking and health committee,

At this point,, the writer discussed the; recommendations Philip Morris had for research' by the tobacoo industry and' the; assumptions made in generating this proposal. The lawyers quickly commented tbat keeping negative results "quiet" would cause tremendous problems in court; actions should the fact come to light that negative data was supressed. In general, the ad hoc committee was; favorable to our suggestions and plan to hoar the other, tobacco companies in the: near future.

Ernie Pebbles; questioned whether there is need for research' funds for TI. It was thought that such fUn<fe could be usedi by Horace Kornegay for political reasons. The writer- felt that the use of such funds for researoh' should) not be a unilateral decision to be made at Kornegay1 s discretion.. The llegal counsel, in general, agreed.

Pebbles them discussed the need' for expert witnesses; bearing in mind the members of SABi ho longer qualify. It was: questioned whether or not such witnesses should tte> from TI. It was concluded that they should not be supplied from TI, but TI people should find these expert witnesses.

The writer mentioned the impendUng problems with* regard to cigarette additives. Alex Spears countered by sayiag we; should' oonsider the technical problems which we can envision* as a result of future protocols imposed on the tobacco industry because of OSHA regulations, etc..

Finally, those present at the meeting wewe asked to keep the dates' of December 13, 14, and 15 open for the next; meeting;.

Tobacco Institute Annual Meeting

January 10, 1980 New York, Hew York

Whoever wrote that what comes in like a lion goes out like a lamb; or what'starts with a bang ends with a whimper, did not work at The Tobacco Institute. 197ft rushed in at a hectic pace, maintained full speed, and is departing in the same way. Like previous years, it was a year of intense activity and high pressure--externally and internally.-

But 1979 was different In one respect. We wdre better prepared. Because we had worked hard on our internal organization, we were able to deal more effectively with our external pressures.  Wo were even able to spare some extra time to orchestrate our individual efforts, .to move toward an overall strategy, to set goals and objectives, to plan ahead.

A review of the projects completed this year may Justify your confidence in. our ability to achieve the objectives in our business pien.

You directed us to Improve industry intelligence, develop our support capabilities, and to improve scientific information services. And we have made gains.

You mandated strengthened state and local activities, strengthened Federal relations, and Improved public understanding and communication* And we have made strides.

You also asked us to strengthen Institute direction and control. And we have made progress.

As a result, some notable achievements were registered this

year.

I The Surgeon General's media event was pre-empted by an

Institute first-strike news conference. For the first time

in the history of the cigarette controversy, a Secretary of

HEW had to share the spotlight. In fact, we won top billing

that night on all networks.

 After a two-and-one-half year hiatus, the President of the Institute has reopened face-to-face talks with a Secretary of HBW* Most credit' for this must go to President Carter for removing the obstacle to direct contact. In fact, good contacts have been re-established with the Executive Branch.

 The Federal Trade Commission reign of regulatory terror may be nearing an end, thanks to the restraining hand of the Senate Commerce Committee. The Commission's ability to invoke the highly subjective concept of "unfairness" as an independent basis for regulating commercial advertising is under increasing attack by industry and the Congress.

t The voters of Bade County defeated an anti-smoking' referendum. .An expensive campaign fight culminated In a narrow victory, ,   . . but a victory nevertheless, in a highstakes political contest with great political consequences*

I Our State legislative scbrVcard showed many more victories than defeats. Out of 113 bills introduced, 8 were enacted, 49 were defeated, and 56 are still pending. Ia New Jersey, we helped enact an amendment preventing such agencies as the Public Health Cotmcil 'from running wild with public smoking regulations-       *

t Communications have been on tho uptrend this year. Our four speakers covered a quarter of a million miles, logging nearly 800 appearances, including 300 hours on the air. Our new publications unit turned out a dozen new publications and distributed about a quarter of a million copies. The Tobacco Observer has reached a circulation of 86,000. Our films have been seen by about 750,000 people this year*-for a cumulative audience of 5% million. I Recognition of the industry's economic impact has been enhanced with completion and widespread distribution of the Wharton study. Further development of this economic data bank is underway.

 Coalitions and alliance building has received attention. Our ties with labor, business, the black caucus, and. urban interests are becoming stronger and mutually rewarding. t Our contacts with Congress, which have always been good, are now even- better. Through a systematic program of Hill coverage, we can now count nearly 300 Representatives and 75 Senators as grade "A" contacts, which means that we know them--but more importantly, they know us.

t Our legal defense against smoking restrictions was bolstered when the Institute's outside counsel won a test case in Virginia, where the State Supreme Court struck down a local anti-smoking ordinance as "an unconstitutional exercise of the city's policy power,"

.We were involved internationally, now that ICOSI was established and in operation. In cooperation with trade association executives from other countries, TI staff

participated as team members in the reporting from Stockholm of the proceedings of the Fourth World Conference on Smoking and Health last June. Earlier, we attended an international tobacco industry conference at Zurich to compare notes on so-called countermeasures in various countries*

While the Institute's record of accomplishment in 1979 has been substantial, so have its problems* We have made progress in resolving many of them. But problems do not disappear with the year's end. They persist.

Hopefully, continued improvement of out internal operations, in accordance with our business plan objectives, will increase our capacity to more effectively deal with the external environment. We will soon have a test of our capability. In the next few days, the Surgeon General will, release yet another report, thl9 time on women and smoking. We- have completed a plan for getting our share of the press coverage surrounding this media event.

Here is the inventory of the issues which will demand our best effort throughout 1980:

1. Increasing smoking restriction activity. The number of state bills has increased about 10 percent over the last year. On the local level, out field staff, TAN volunteers, and others report 130 local restrictive measures--a sharp increase in activity. Referenda battles are alto looming, in California, in Dade County, and a new state-Oregon.

* Other State legislation affecting the tobacco industry is also up for consideration: 160 bills pertaining to advertising, insurance, health research, minors, tar and nicotine*

A significant emerging problem is statewide sampling legislation with 7 bills Introduced this year, over S last year, Minneapolis and-'St. Paul passed sampling restrictions this year, and bans are pending in Chicago and Seattle,

2. A deceptive calm blankets tW Federal front, due largely to pre-election year preparation. Not one of the 21 anti-tobacco bills has moved beyond the introduction stage. Neither Rep. Waxman or Sen. Kennedy has had time for tobacco. Sen. Hart has even consulted us on an asbestos, compensation bill. Rep. Johnson of Colorado, who mounted several frontal attacks on the tobacco support program, is stepping down. To these glad tidings we can add the possibility of favorable legislation as a wave of regulatory reform sweeps over the Federal Trade Commission.

But we cannot afford to be lulled into a false sense of security. Several threats do Indeed exist; they can be fueled by adverse publicity; ilxhy can lead to legislation or regulation. For example: --Self-extinguishing cigarettes.

--The social cost of smoking impacts national health insurance, social security disability payments, and most recently has been used by some insurance companies as a sales promotion gimmick.

--The blame-tobacco-tactic used by embattled industries, such as asbestos and chemicals, will increase along with their problems.

--The inevitable inclusion of smoking in the government's expanding health promotion and disease prevention programs will call attention to smoking among teens and pregnant women. --Cigarette excise problems will return with pressure from States to collect revenue lost to contraband traffic.

Success in dealing with these emerging problems will depend, in large measure, on our success in improving industry credibility. This is the linchpin of our efforts, for our      * credibility stands or falls on both what we ,say_ and what we do--as a trade association and as an industry.

Credibility is an integrating concept, requiring us to combine our resources, our. resourcefulness, and our" will to create in the minds of others the expectation that we will act responsibly--dellvering what we promise and promising no more than we can deliver.

Achieving industry credibility, therefore, involves all individuals and all departments of The tobacco Institute: state activities, federal relations, public relations, professional and administrative, headquarters staff and field personnel. And most importantly, you--the leaders of our member companies. " It is no longer sufficient to have a superior lobbying effort in Washington and in the states, or to possess an effective public communications apparatus, or to command skilled professional experts.

now is an industry strategy based on industry credibility.

Accordingly, the Institute will propose positions on each' emerging issue. We will give you our analysis, present alternatives, and make recommendations for policy decisions--^SS" your decisions. We will approach government regulation of the tobacco business in a business-like manner, tempered by our political, PR, and professional judgment and expertise.

In the year ahead, we intend to carry out our mission of leadership and direction by a concentrated and coordinated effort to increase our credibility.

I We intend to install and implement an effectiva, highly sophisticated information system.

 We intend to build a flve:year industry communications program to include a new national advertising campaign*

 We intend to expand our spokespersons program, targeting their audiences and messages, and including many more tobacco company employee information forums.

I We intend to maintain surveillance over the results of

the independent scientific research in which the tobacco

industry has invested over $80 million to date.

f We will optimize tobacco Industry economic data through

the project we are conducting with the Wharton Business School.

The tobaooo industry is also concerned about the charges being made that smoking Is responsible for so many serious diseases. Long before tht present criticism began, the tobacco Industry, in  sincere atteapt tc determine what harmful affects, if any, ^poking might have on human health, establithed Tha Council for, Tobacco PesearchPSA*   The industry has also supported research '' grants direoted by the American Medical Association,   Over the years tht tobacoo industry has given In excess of tut mill ion to independent research on the controversies Surrounding smoking  mora then all the voluntary health associations combined.

Despite all the research going on, tha simple ind unfortunate fact Is that scientists do not know the cause or causes of the    chronic diseases reported to be associated with smoking.   The     "

SUBJs Report on meeting at AMA. re ERF tobacco program'

According: to Dr. Howard, AMA's executive director with whom I met today at Ded Braun's request, AMA is not prepared to make any statement regarding termination of the smoking-health research program, knows of no statement which would not further damage the images of both itself and the tobacco industry, and is"under no internal pressure to make any move at this time'in the matter*

At nine a.m. today, an hour before our meeting, with Howard and the AMA p.r. director, Frank Campion, Braun told me that our purpose in seeing Howard was to notify him that the "executive committee" had rejected a recommendation that surplus ERF tobacco funds be earmarked for "minority group" medical student support.

Braun told me this recommendation had come from Dr. Kernodle, vice-chairman of the AMA (and ERF) board of trustees. He said he recently discussed the entire situation (prior to the last meeting of the TI executive committee) with Howard and Kernodle in a three-way phone conversation. One result of that was, Braun said, that Kernodle was to discuss the whole situation with you prior to the New York meeting.

Howard's response to Braun's notification this morning was that the funds would therefore be used by 8RF to continue supporting already approved projects,  (The current letter of agreement from the companies to AMA evidently stipulates

that in no event are any funds to be returned to the contributors,) As to how much money is at staket   Howard gave Braun a'written accounting, which Braun has kept, showing 1) that the residual fund now amounts to $1,3-odd million and 2) that except for Brown and Williamson, all the participating companies are in arrears on 1970 contributionsin each case a six-figure amount, with RJR the highest at more than $600,000* Howard said AMA will refund B & W's 1970 payment of some $270,000 if B & W wishes, from the current $1.3 million balance.

Howard made it clear that ERF does no research other than that funded by tobacco companies,.that there is no basis for and will not be any AMA announcement that it Is ending "all its research programs," and that its announcement last year of the closing of its internal research institute has no connection with the present matter. (After the meeting Braun told me that Howard previously said the termination of this program would be in the context of AMA ending "all" research activitiesr he said Howard has changed his view on this. However, we of the staff have kept very close track of all AMA-ERF reports, and have never seen any indication of research projects other than- smoking and health.)

Howard further indicated that if the cigarette companies wish to cancel their current commitment, he would like to have a suitable letter to that effect.

Howard said he regards the program- as a great liabilitythat from AMA's view it has only caused further blackening of AMA's image. He said from the industry's standpoint the research has produced no evidence to clear cigarettes from the generally accepted conclusion that they cause "lung carcinoma" and other maladlies. Ke said he thought the latter point would be widely*^ reported as the reason- the industry decided to terminate the   program, regardless of what is said by either party about it, {Q Howard also made these pointsi                                                                       m

1.  He is most anxious to avoid any incident which will create displeasure with AMA among tobacco area Congressmenhe said AMA needs their support urgently,

2,  He is told that $5% of the ERF research with tobacco funds has been "useful basic research11 but that through neglect by all concerned no effort has really been made to Impress anyone in or out of AMA with- this,

3,  There will be a "national meeting in October" of the ERF grantees, similar to those held in San Francisco in 1968 and Scottsdale in 1970, and he does, not at this

wi,T time propose to cancel the meeting, (It has been our understanding that the next meeting of the grantees was to be held in 1972it may be that Howard is mistaken about this.)

4,  He will inform only Kernodle of this morning's discussion, and Campion will discuss it with no one.

5.  He does not now intend to remind the four companies with respect to their arrears,

6.  He and Campion, as well as ourselves, should continue to consider what might be done, and what response might be made if there is any unlikely leak over the current discussions.

It nay be assumed that the medloal profession is the group whioh it ' 1 wet doeired io reaoh and convince.   T/o venture the opinion that they are less skeptical.than other ftolentifle groups and ere oaaier to convince, if properly approached*  However they are jealous of their prestige and fearful of exploitation) therefore difficult to reaoh*

While members of the ohemloal and allied professions are Interested in the chemical end physical nature" of teheeoo products and tobaooo anolrej the joodioal profession is interested in the eelenoe of tobacco only as it rotates to the effects of tobaoeo upon the smoker's health.   Although a thorough knowledge of tobaooo ctonletry ie indispensable for tho maintenance of quality, the  average doctor would be quite unimpressed by the display of such knowledge end Ignorant of Its significance unless inteweted for him*  And he would resent s^     any attempt to draw conclusions relating to health from chwaloal research *

The only Idnd of research tfoloh may.be expected.to impress the medical profession is that obtained by tho pharmacologist or the physiologist in a biological laboratory*   It was a recognition of this faot that jxrompted utr to provide for a Biological Bepartment when the Research Laboratory vas designed,

The biolctftloal research done by the Hedloal Ooilege of Virginia under . our rosstrch grant and by ourselves provide evidence that the alleged eerlous effects of smoking tin health are being greatly exaggerated*   In fact, it appears likely flat-impartial research will show tbat smoking has a negligible effect on the health of noma! Individuals;  Butihie would never be euspeoted by reading . ' the extensive  medical literature on tobacco*

The toVoeoo Industry is very much in need of some friendly research in this field* *fce company that first engages in active biological research and publishes its results oould not fall to Impress the leaders in the medloal profession with the inport&nee of their xorki Such research *ouM also provide , material for an approach to the medloal profession, If that was desired. Bach a novo would eorvo tho doublo purpose of improving the attitude of the medloal profession toward the tobaooo industry and, particularly, reflecting credit upon tbe.ooapny with the foresight to engage In the work*.

In our Judgment, the connection vith the Kedieal College of Virginia ' has been very productive. Aside from the Information -secured through their research, we have been impressed with the completeness with which the staff . of the Kedlcal Oollege has been "sold American", This encourages the belief that if our activities were better known, more medical men could be brought into the fold* We feel * therefore, that more emphasis should be placed on biologloal research and that we should add to our staff in this department.

At present, we have over forty men engaged In work on the'ohenleel, physical and engineering phases of oigarette,manufacturing,' If have only one jhyaiolc&letj he is doing biological research under our grant' at the Kedieal Oollege* It le our feeling that we should continue with the Medloal College of Virginia be fomerly. They would aesune all responsibility for the experiments as far as the layman is concerned and this would protect us from any possible eritiolen from that source.

By dfivoloping its Biologloal Division, the Research laboratory should be able in a few years to establish itself as in authority not only in the field of

Having our own Biological Laboratory would make impossible to conduct more estensivo experiments, particularly on oootpatitivo brands, than seems proper in an Institution whioh Is publicly supported*  As an insurance against possible    attacks in the future, we oould, to advantage, test everything we use In our products*  Our records would then provide a clean bill of health for w^ty brand which ** market, one which would be acceptable tb the medical profession*

Obviously, all of the work done ia our' Biological Baboratory would be kept strictly confidential, as are investigations in all other departments*

From time to time,* our ohemleal researoh would reveal situations which refleot the Company's products to unusual advantage.  tfhen these situations arise, we shell bo in a position to make oomparlsoae ehenioally, biologieeCUy and perhaps clinically*   The results of suoh comparisons might be of no email value in advertising.                                             

In the above diecuaslou, an attexpt b&s been made to visual*** the, advantages which would aftorue from an aetlve Biological Division in the Research . Laboratory.   For the present, ve should proceed vtftb extreme caution.in so far as personnel is concerned,                  ;

As a result of discussions with Hr, Nelley, Dr. Haag was asked nearly a year ago to look about for a man having the desired qualification**   He should oomblne ability and experience with a brondfiinded attitude toward the tobaooo industry.   It was not until recently that Dr. Haag could find any one vfttom be considered well qualified for the position. Be has now recommended Br* barsen,"

Although Br* harsen eeema to bo sf&endidly equipped for the position, I feel tbat we should not take him into our stuff dirobtly end 1 therefore .asked Br, Haag If come arrangement could be wade whereby the Medical College might secure Ms services on the basis of a grant, Br, Sanger, President of th* Medical Oollege, has been very, cooperative. Or course the Medloal College, of Virginia would receive nothing for their good offices, the on)y advantage being to uej namely, if for any reason it was decided at the end of the year that he wee not the jtroper man for the place, or bcoauee of a change la policy we would nott desire to continue with the promotion of the Biological Laboratory, his connection could ba severed without embarrassment to va*

In the mean tine, be can do a number of thing* whioh we feel should be doce to refute the reckless statements tfoieh are being made almost daily at the expense of the tobacco industry, lbs services of Br* Negus fit nicely intothis program by providing leads and assisting in the development of * method for an acceptable approach to the.edioel profession, using the itatorlel ouppHod by our Biological laboratory.

Aside from the direct benefits to accrue from the further promotion of biologloal research, there' is an intangible but a very important additional benefit.

Pear DeBaunx

Pursuant to my telephone conversation with you and Jim Ravlin on Friday, and my conversation with you today, please find enolosed the substanoe of a proposed letter to ithe Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health.

I am of the present opinion that we should eliminate from the draft of April 23, 19B3 any references which are designed to "play up" the competitive qualities of Brown & Williamson's products.

I am of the further opinion that any description in the letter to the Committee of the methods and steps involved in the various scientific research programs oonduoted by Brown & Williamson must necessarily be so vague and incomplete as to be irksome to the reader.  However, X am also of the opinion, that, under the oircurnstanoes, it is neoessary that Brown & Williamson say something in reply to the Surgeon-General's Advisory Committee's request*  Therefore, it is my suggestion that we state simply that we have oonduoted no medical research, having left that to TIRC, and then proceed to enumer-ate the various soientiflo research programs sponsored or finanoed by Brown & Williamson without commenting upon them and inform the Surgeon General's Committee that in the event any particular program is of interest to the Committee it may be assured of Brown & Williamson's full cooperation.  In the-event a program proves to be of interest to the Committee and a request for details is made, we will meet that problem when it arises. I repeat it is unfortunate that Brown & Williamson must submit anything, but this approach seems to me to be the most innocuous of the alternatives.

X enclose a oopy of Bowman Cray's letter about which        jj|

I spoke to you.  Iteynolds' handling of the matter is of course    92

simplified by Its being in a position to deliver a considerable    K

amount of published matter.                                                                                           S

.*' &*. Louisville, Kentuoky

m    attach Dr. Haggard's study, as to do so might only raise a *#., question as to why the findings of the other programs were not ,  also attached.

I am of the opinion that reference to scientific programs on which Brown d> Williamson plans to embark in the future is probably gratuitous, in that it is not responsive to the ....  request and certainly .not helpful to the Committee from a ;'.     scientific point of view and for that reason may not be well '.;.. received by the Committee,

Section 4 of tho Federal Cigarette Labeling and ' Advertising Act requires that each package of clga* rettes manufactured, imported or packaged for sale or distribution within the United States bear the following statementi

.  "Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous r - to Your Health."

tfhis warning statement must be placed "in a conspicuous place on every cigarette package" and "appear in conspicuous and legible type in contrast by typography, layout, or color with other printed matter on the package,"

. Iho Act became effective on January 1, 1966, and to the knowledge of the Commission all cigarette manu facturera have complied with the labeling provisions. In most cases the warning statement has been placed on the side panel of the package, No action for violation of the Act has been brought by the Justice Department, which has sole responsibility for its enforcement,

there'is no way of knowing how'many cigarettes might have been sold In tho absence of the warning. Yet the Inadequacy of the warning statement becomes oloar by .comparing the sharp drop in cigarette sales following publication of the Surgeon General's report with the continuing rise in sales after the warning statement appeared on cigarette packages,

The Commission's evaluation of the ineffectiveness of the warning statement on packages is shared both, by

Thus, cigarette sales have continued to increase each year except for 1964, when they declined by 10*7 billion or about 2 $ #  , As noted above, the decline in 1964 is probably due to the publicity that accompanied the publication of the Report of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health on January 11,

3964, in fac^, of the lo^r^iito^^dUi^e^nWSwm

'^963 to I96/I/ 10 bj lUo^'6od,uJ^ generally tyi^e-r it}: J,9p^ti^n/inJ^9pS,'.}

Ofie statistics on per capita consumption of cigarettes for persons 18 years of age and over reflect the statistics on total sales. In 1963, per capita consultation reached a high of 4345 cigarettes and then dropped' to 4195 in 1964, increased to 4295 in 1965 and rose to its second highest level of 4290 cigarettes in 1966* (Tobacco Situation, U.S, Department of Agriculture, Mar^T156TT)"---

Figures on cigarette shipments for the first three months of 1967, as noted in the- Wall Street Journal of May 23, 1967, indicate that there was a 4^ gain in January over last year, but there was a 7,X# deoiine In February and a ?.4# drop in .March. 

The latest figures available from the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Division of the Internal Revenue -Service show that cigarette shipments for April, 1967 increased 10.75? ever April, 1966.

Another factor to be noted is the proliferation of brands and types within the various brands of cigarettes. Whereas in 1963 there were approximately 40 brands and types on the market, the number has risen to over l4o In 1966, As should be expected, praotlcally all recent introductions are in the filter field. There have been few if any new .nonfliter oigarettes introduced In the past Beveral years,

The most recent trend has been the extension of *              '

several existing brands Into the extra-long 100 mill!-               \

meter length type of oigarette, This has resulted from             !

the success in 1966 of the extra-long Benson & Hedges                 ! and pall Malls,                             .

This'trend is of a serious and disturbing nature since these extra-long cigarettes also expose the smoker

to greater amounts of tar and nicotine, making them                     I

potentially more hazardous than the shorter length'                       ! cigarettes.    .            

. Despite the faot that little attention Is paid to the warning statement, its mere appearanoe on the oigarette package by mandate of Congress has served to convince some people, who.might otherwise be in doubt, that smoking is in faot dangerous, Also, it has been uBed by educators in the schools as "proof" of the health hazards of smoking. An investigator engaged in an anti-smoking educational program advised the Commission 1              

"A statement that I do not encounter, since the cautionary label, is, ^t it were really so dangerous the government would do something about It,'" (Edgar K, Kllbey, Chief Investigator, ' Smoking project, Methodist Hospital, Indianapolis, Indiana,)

; In considering methods ,of adequately communicating the health hoards of cigarette smoking, one must dis- . tlnguish between two groups: smokers and nonsmokers. Because cigarette smoking is so strongly habit-forming, it is unlikely that a mildly phrased c&utionary statement will have any effect on confirmed cigarette smokers, For the InforDiatlon of cigarette smokers, the Commission favors mandatory labeling of tar and nicotine content on cigarette packages and in cigarette advertisements and other measures that win prompt cigarette manufacturers to develop less hazardous cigarettes. Also, the Commission believes that oontlnual repetition of the warning statement in all cigarette advertisements and on the package will serve as a constant reminder of the health hazards; and further believes that the warning statement should be strengthened,

..Because," once started, the cigarette smoking habit is so difficult to break, the Commission believes that people should be educated as to the health hazards before they reach the age when they are likely to begin smoking, Since most oigarette smokers start smoking during the middle and late teenage years, 7/ educational programs should be heavily in the school:

To develop an informed attitude toward cigarette smoking will be a formidable task, Every day new

          Nonetheless, the problems which prompted the Commission to act in |"   the past still exist. While most Americans are generally aWare that

eitoking is hazardous, some consumers, especially smokers* do not know |    this basic fact. However, even if it is anfeutfed that eyer-y consumer ,    Is aware that a mo king is hazardous, the evidence, indicates tliat irany

      consumers do not have enough informs ti,on $6out t^e health risks of

|    Bricking in order to know ^w/Haangeroyj^StpojtjLnq, jja, i*e.r what is the

nature end extent of /he health risk of smoking, Marty consumer^ Aleo j    do not know whether the general health rifcks of snvoking have any

personal relevance to themselves or whether they ure  atpong those I    groups of people who may be uniquely vulnerable to these health j I    hazards. Finally, without more specific, concrete information,

consumers hav# a pore difficult time remembering and are less likely I    to consider health information at all in making their smoking

decision. I       More specifically, the data discussed in Chapter III suggest that |    many consumers do not know enough about the health effects of smoking

to know how dangerous smoking is and indeed desire more information f    about the specific hazards of smoking. For example, the data

indicate that many do not know what diseases are smoking related* L.    over 30 of the public ie unaware of the relationship between smoking l     and heart disease. Nearly 50% of all women do not know that ercoking

during pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirth and miscarriage* I     Approximately 30% of those polled do not know about the relationship

between smoking, birth control pills and the risk of heart attack. L                                                                               9

As the evidence in the section in Chapter HI on "Overall Risk"

As a result of these findings, staff undertook a re-evaluation of the current warning. After careful examination, staff believes that the ourtent warning is not effective. The number of persons who understand that smoking is a health problem has increased in the last decade, fcowevet, surveys show that. the public still lacks iribtigtv information about ti)e risks of snioking to appreciate how; dahge^s :i%^ is, This gap in knowledge may be due to the fact that the current warning refers to the health hazard of smoking only in the most generalized way. The warning does not communicate information on significant, specific risks that have recently been identified. Furthermore, after nearly a decade the current warning has been overexposed and has simply worn out. This conclusion is further  !.;.' su;pp&rtjd by data i$diating that  leis -th^n i'l^ot;adults. ^xrV^d;|b'i;5 cigarette ads ever even read the warning. While cigarette ads present their message in a variety of frequently changing, attention getting formats using numerous Image provoking, personalizable themes, the current abstract warning In the same rectangular shape has appeared unchanged in every cigarette ad for so long that few people ever notice or pay attention to it. The failure ot  the warning to provide specific health information and the abstract nature of the current warning, which makes it mot* difficult for consumers to relate the warning to themselves, contribute to its ineffectiveness. Thus, while the current health warning may have represented a reasonable remedial effort nearly a decade ago based upon the evidence then available, the continued growth of medical knowledge about the health consequences of smoking and new evidence about the present ineffectiveness of the current warning indicate that a new informational remedy may now be necessary.

Cigarettes are the ttost heavily advertised plrddiiCt in  America,2 It has been estimated that the six major cigarette companies spent one billion dollars in 1980 to sell their product.3 This figure is several hundred times greater than the amount government spends on,public service announcements on smoking hazards.4 The National Commission on Smoking s>i%8>#.ttblli|fr-'-"P62 reported in 1978 that the tobacco industry spent mo^SQh, a^^l^s/irtg-cigarettes ,,:ih, on: day than the.

Moreover, a review of the results indicates that the data are consistent between studies, and, according to the 1980 Roper study of consumer knowledge, consistent along sex, race, age, socioeconomic, and geographic variables. These consistencies further suggest that the data are reliable and valid. Finally, to permit the reader to draw his or her own conclusions rom the data, staff has presented the evidence in the following section in considerable detail* generally including the question asked as well as the results. In sum, the combined results of all the studies discussed in this section represent the most comprehensive evidence available of overall consumer knowledge, beliefs, and awareness of the health b&2ards of smoking,

*   THE JjELEVANCEPF SPECIFIC HEALTH INFORMATION

Staff has proceeded in this investigation on the assumption that most people are generally aware thot smoking is hazardous. To a large extent, this assumption is supported by the data. Thus, although it is clear that not every American knows smoking is hasardous^-indeed, Gallup found that 241 of heavy smokers do not know or believe it is ba?ardous--most Americans are aware of this basic fact. However, the data also indicate that many Americans are not aware of any more specific information about smoking and health.

There are several reasons why this more specific health information ia relevant to consumers. First, knowledge <?f rnore specific information is relevant to an understanding of hbW dangerous smoking is? i.e*, what is the nature and general extent 6f  the health

Second, knowledge of pofg specific information IS relevant to consumers' awareness of whether the general health risks of BmoHng have any personal, application1 to themselvep or whether they are among those,groups fof-people who may ,b> .uniquely vulnerable to these health hazards. Third, numerous studies'demonstrate \b*% consumers have a more difficult time remembering general or abstract information, are more likely to consider it personally irrelevant, and are less likely to consider health information at. al^w^houfe more specific information./                                                                        :t

Typically, in other situations in which consumers make decisions which effect their health, they want and are provided more specific information. For example, patients consenting to surgery are told more than the general fact that the surgery may somehow be dangerous to their health. The patient is told what the potential harmful consequences of the surgical procedure are, how likely it is that the patient will suffer from these consequences and how serious these consequences are likely to be, including how likely it is that the patient might die as a result of the surgery* Similarly, a woman who

II.   OVERALL RISK AND.......REDUCTION, IN LIFE EXPECTANCV

It has been almost 17 years since the Surgeon General first determined that cigarette smoking is hazardous to health. For 15 years, warnings to that effect have appeared on cigarette packages and for almost ten years, warnings have also appeared on every cigarette ad. Yet, survey data Indicate that a substantial portion of people remain unaware of the serious overall health risk associated with smoking,

The data, projected nationwide, indicate that some Americans still do not even know that smoking is hazardous to healty/' in 1978, Gallup asked respondents whether they believed smoking was harmful to health, Although 3 01 of the sample did not know, that smoking had any haiJi<ul'fiis'tfi,s"J:^:iifV'1or*l:l smokers did not know that smoking is harmful to health, arid nearly one out of every four' * 24\ -heavy smokers did net know this fact,8 In the l97p'Kopet study* 9* of the total sample, 131 of all smokers, and 20* of two pack or tnore a day smokers did hot know that smoking was hasatdous.9 Given tbat there are approximately 54 million smokers in this country, these data suggest that millions of Americans who smoke still do not know that smoking is harmful to their health.

More significantly,,the.data reveal that many consumers do hSt kpow that smoking significantly decreases a person's life expectancy, a critical fact for consumers tb jinow in order to; Ui#rstahdJ<^rT dangerous smoking is td them. A thirty year old smoker will shorten his life on the average by between six and eight years if he smokes a pack a day.10 Bovver* atn&ng th|>ee; polia4 in the 1930 Roper ^'udy,, 304 of the po^Hilal'tlon ;iiflHB**2%/ JL>f-:ltt># ^liT^lt^a'^did not know that a typical thirty year old male shortened his life expectancy at .all by smoking.'1 Among those who did know that smoking reduces one's life expectancy, many seriously underestimated the degree to which this is true. On the average, nonsmokers underestimated this loss in life expectancy by about 2 years, while smokers underestimated it by more than four years.*2

Similar results were obtained when respondents were asked if they thought a fortyyear old man increased his risk of dying within the next year by smoking a pack a day. By smoking a'pack a day, a man

Since many people greatly underestimate the percent of lung cancer cases attributable to smoking, it is also likely that many people are unaware that smoking is the major cause of lung cancer, In the 1980 Roper study, 254 of all respondents failed to mention smoking when asked to name the number one cause of lung cancer. In the 1978 KOpet poll conducted for the tobacco industry, respondents were asked whether they agreed with the following false statementt "Air pollution is the major cause of lung cancer, not cigarette smoking," Twenty-two percent of the total sample agreed with this statement? 314 of the smokers polled agreed, in addition, 284 of the total sample and 294 of the smokers answered "don't knov." In other words, responses to this question indicated that 504 of the to'tal population, and 604 of smokers, do not realise that cigarette smoking ie the major cause of lung cancer,37

36 1980 Roper, a. 27.

31 1976 Roper, q, 18h. The difference between the 1978 and I960 results might be explained by the fact that persons answering the open-ended question in the 1980 study were focusing on the words "lung cancer" rather than "number one cause" in the question. Thus, those who believed smoking caused lung cancer, whether or not they knew it was the number one cause, responded "smoking*" The 254 who did not respond "smoking" is consistent with the data discussed above, which indicate that approximately that percent of the population do not know that smoking causes lung cancer. Results to this question do suggest that consumer knowledge about lung cancer and smoking is not "soft" - rather, no matter how you test it, about three-fourths of the population know that smoking causes lung cancer* The 1980 Roper study suggests knowledge about all types of cancer ia relatively "hard" - i.e., results between aided and unaided (open-ended) recall questions are fairly consistent - in marked contrast to consumer knowledge concerning heart attack and pregnancy, where knowledge appeared much greater in response to multiple choice questions than to open-ended ones,

In each of the major medical areas discussed above, the data indicate significant gaps in consumer knowledge of the health hazards of smoking. In addition to those major medical areas, staff has analyzed data concerning consumer knowledge of several other                           I

areas. These areas arei the addictive nature of cigarette smoking* the presence of carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke* the relative     I safety of low "tar" and nicotine cigarettes; and the r-^ationship     f between birth control pills, smoking, and heart attack.

Many researchers now believe that carbon monoxide may be one of the most harmful Ingredients of the more than 2,000 known ingredients in cigarette smoke. CO is the substance in cigarette smoke which many medical experts believe to ba most dangerous to fetal and infant health. In addition, many experts believe CO is the agent most likely to bt responsible for the increased risk of heart disease among smokers.96 Yet, the Chilton study reveals' that many people are unaware that cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide. When asked, "Does cigarette smoke contain carbon monoxide?", 514 of teens and 454 of adults either thought it did not or did not know.97 Similar results were obtained by Roper in the 1980 study, where $3% of the sample and 564 of smokers did not know that "Cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide, which is a dangerous gas*"90

"' STAFF BELIEVES THE CURRENT WARNING IS INEFFECTIVE

The current health warning was included in cigarette advertisements as a  result of consent orders signed by the six major cigarette companies and the Commission in 1972,16 The current investigation was Lcjun to determino whether the deceptive practices which previously had caused Congress and the Commission to act have been effectively remedied. Therefore, the effectiveness of the current warning as a remedy had to be reexamined. After careful examination, the staff believes that the current warning is not effective in curing the deception in cigarette advertising, nor does it provide sufficient information to permit consumers to assess the healthj risks of smoking accurately.*7

There are two major o^j:e^iye:;.iridi'i:-'Q;f the ineffccfcivftneaft of the current warning, discussed in detail below. First, as the staff's investigation of consumer knowledge has demonstrated, a substantial portion of the public remains uninformed about the hazards of smoking. Second, tests conducted i>y the PTC {Confidential Information Omitted) indicate that the warning is neither noticed nor read by the vast majority of people. The underlying causes of the current warning's ineffectiveness are discussed below,^

16 Lorillard, et al*, 80 F.T.C. 455 {1972). *' & Cn* jn* supra.

ie The reasons discussed in this section do not constitute the only reasons for the current warning's ineffectiveness. As will be explained in detail, infra at Ch. V, the unchanging sise and shape of the current warning contribute to its ineffectiveness.

'     * *".

In contrast to the current warning, cigarette advertisements present positive information about smoking in a highly ^ffectivle manner. They communicate the desirable aspects of smoking in a : variety of attention-getting formats. Having attracted the reader's attention, the ads present positive information about smoking,through' numerous concrete l^a^erb?o^ok I ng, personal liable'theme's, each theme, presented in manyjdifl^teht:;wayB.

Novelty. One of the most potent factors in increasing the likelihood that a piece of information will be spontaneously retrieved 1b novelty.29 Studies have shown that information that Is novel or unexpected is likely to capture one's attention, is processed more extensively, and subsequently is much more likely to be recalled than information that is redundant or expected to appear

Health Benefits of Smoking Option

The overall mortality ratio of former smokers (compared with never smokers) declines with increasing years of abstinence. According to data reviewed in the 1979 Surgeon General's Report (US 'DHEW 1979a) from the U.S. Veterans Study and the British Doctors Study, overall mortality rates of former smokers arc similar to those of never smokers 15 years after quitting (US DHBW 1979a). With respect to lung canoer mortality, the increased risk diminishes substantially by 5 to 9 years after quitting, but remains above Ihe risk of never smokers for many more years except for those with fewer than 30 years of cigarette smoking (Chapter 2). A reduction In CHD mortality occurs within the first few years after cessation (JJS DHHS 1983). The risk of COPD mortality decreases eventually after smoking cessation but does not decline to equal that of neversmokcrs, even after 20 years of cessation (US DHHS 1984).

In the 1986 AUTS, respondents were asked how long it takes before former smokers' chances of developing a disease return to normal. Slightly more than half believed that the risks return to normal within 5 years (Table 21). Results were similar when stratified by smoking status,

The 1987 NH1S included questions regarding the health benefits of quitting in terms of specific disease risks. These data were not available for inclusion in this Report,

Discussion

It has been 25 years since the release of the first Surgeon General's Report on smoking and health. During that time, a tmpt public health effort has been made to educate the public regarding the health consequences of smoking (see Chapters &<&),

Public knowledge of the health risks of smoking has improved as a result of this massive public health education campaign. The belief that smoking is harmful to health has increased since 1964. In 1964, a majority of adults acknowledged the general health risk of smoking and believed that smoking is a major cause of lung cancer, but a minority believed that smoking increases the risk of COPD, heart disease, and premature birth, By the mid-1980s, a substantial majority of adults (including nonsmokers and smokers) recognized the general health risks of smoking and believed that smoking increases the risk of lung cancer, COPD, and heart disease, and prematurity, low birthweight, miscarriage, and stillbirths.

Knowledge of the risks of exposure toETS has also increased markedly since 1974; in fact, this high level of belief preceded the release of the 1986 Surgeon General's Report on the health consequences of involuntary smoking,

The 1990 Health Objectives for the Nation

In 1980, the U.S. Public Health Service established the 1990 Health Objectives for tlie Nation (US DHHS 1980). A midcourse review of progress toward meeting these objectives was published in 1986 (US DHHS 1986b). These objectives included five goals for public knowledge of the health consequences of smoking:

Objective I: By 1990, the share of Ihe adult population .ware that smoking is one of the major risk factors for heart disease should be increased to at least 85 percent.

Objective 2: By 1990, at leaat 90percent of ih adult population should be aware that smoking it a major uk of lung cancer, as well as multiple other cancers including laryngeal, esophageal, bladder, and Other types.

Objective 3: By 1990, at least 85 percent of the adult population should be aware of the special rick of developing and worsening chronic obstructive lung disease, including bronchitis and emphysema, among smokers.

Objective 4; By 1990. at least 85 percent of women should be aware of the special health risks for women who smoke, including the effect on outcomes of pregnancy and the excess risk of CVD with oral contraceptive use,

Objective 5: By 1990, at leasi 65 percent of 12-year-olds should be able to Identify smoking cigarettes with increased risks of serious disease of the heart and lungs.

For Ihe purposes of these objectives, the term aware was not defined and no distinction was made between Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 beliefs (see above).

Progress toward meeting the first two objectives cannot be assessed reliably because they refer to smoking as "one of the major risk factors" for heart disease and "a major cause" of lung cancer and other cancers, On the other hand, most surveys have assessed public beliefs about whether smoking increases the risk of or "is related to" heart disease or lung cancer (Tables 8 and 9). As mentioned above, such wording changes can markedly affect results of surveys assessing public beliefs.

The third objective appears to have been met in the case of emphysema and nearly met in the case of chronic bronchitis (Table 10). In 1985, the percentages of adults 18 to 44 years of age who acknowledged the various effects of maternal smoking on the fetus were generally 10 to 20 percentage points below the goals listed in the fourth objective, except thai 85 percent of women believed that smoking during pregnancy In-

Conclusions^

1.    In the 1950s, 40 to 50 percent of adults believed that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer. By 1986, this proportion had Increased to 92 percent (including 85 percent of current smokers).

2.    Between 1964 and 1986, the proportion of adults who believed thai cigarette smoking increases the risk of heart disease rose from 40 to 78 percent, A similar increase occurred among smokers, from 32 to 71 percent.

3.   The proportion of adults who believed that cigarette smoking increases the risk of emphysema and chronic bronchitis rose from 50 percent in 1964 to 81 jerceni (chronic bronchitis) and 89 percent (emphysema) in 1986. These proportions increased among current smokers from 42 percent In 1964 to 73 percent (chronic

"( &$, T!

5.

In 1985, substantial percentages of women of chiidbearing age did not believe that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of stillbirth (32 percent), miscarriage (25 percent), premature birth (24 percent)* and having k low-birth weight baby (15 percent). Of women in this age group, 28 percent did not believe that women taking birth control pills have a higher risk of stroke if they smoke. Some smokers today do not recognize their own personal risk from smoking or they minimi?/, it. In 1986, only 18 percent of smokers were "very concerned" about the effects of smoking on their health, and 24 percent were not at all concerned.

In 1986, about half of current smokers and 40 percent of never smokers incorrectly believed that a person would have to smoke 10 or more cigarettes perday before it would affect his or her health.

Many smokers underestimate the population impact of smoking. In 1987,28 percent of smokers (and 16 percent of the general population) disagreed with the statement, '"Most deaths from lung cancer are caused by cigarette smoking." The proportion of high school seniors who believe that smoking a pack or more of cigarettes per day causes great risk of harm increased from 51 percent in 1975 to 66 percent in 1986.

In 1986. about three-quarters of adults believed that using chrwing tobacco or snuff is harmful to health.

Ihe social acceptability of smoking In public is declining, as measured by the proportion of adults who find it annoying to be near a person smoking cigarettes. This proportion increased from 46 percent in 1964 to 69 percent in 1986,

These tovestlgatlont, conducted In several parti of the United States (M, 5) and In England (0* have followed the fancier cate-bUtory pattern, where retrospective histories of amoklng ara obtained from patients with the illness under, review and ue thin compared with ttrail&r histories of other pereont not having that diteate, They are gooerally contltttnt in thevring a higher poroenttge of cigarette smokers among interviewed potlemt with lung cancer than found among other Interviewed Individuals with whom thoy were compared.

The present report records tho results of a ttudy of similar type that differs In two geueral retpeett from those previously recorded. First, tbt tmoklitg habits of patients with cancer at several additional site* are presented, and toeoud, the results are expressed In direct terms of the magnitude of the relative risk of cancer among smokers and non-imokew.

Classification, of Smoking Habits

With human cancers that are believed to bo precipitated by exposure to chemical carcinogens, degree and duration of exposure are generally considered to bo directly related to tumor production. It is, therefore, not unrcasonablo to expect that these factors may be important if smoking It etiologically related to cancer.

It Is general experience that trucking habits do not remain fixed through, out life. The habit starts at some age after which tho quantities and types of tobacco smoked may vary considerably from timo to time, and frequently may bo Interspersed with periods of partial or complcto abstinence. It further seems clear that retrospective histories of smoking are not likely to give a very precise account ot actual past smoking habits. However, unless cancers of some- types Independently tend to select individuals with more accurate memories, there seems little reason to believe that this factor operates differently in tbe persons with different classes of Dines* under ttudy htre. Any torlout bias on the pert of tho tutervWer appears unlikely in this ttudy since smoking history wot only oat of a larger number of habltt, etc., covered. Even, however, If accurate recorda kept during a lifetime vrere available, the bookkeeping Involved In sumnmrbing smoking histories would introduce difficulties.

For the purposes of tlds study some of these classification difficulties are arbitrarily solved. It Is teen In table 1 that of tho ^40. patients who smoked, 3,070 (70 percent) gave "pure" smoking historletj that It, they claimed to have smoked only cigarettes, pipes, or cigars. Tho remainder (728 or 30 pet-cent) smoked a combination of two or more ol these typos of tobaeco ("mixed" smoking). The 801 patients who aro dossed as non-smokers smoked "very rarely," "very occasionally/* or net et til. In tabulating quantity of smoking per day for "mixed" smoking, cigars and pipe tobacco are converted to their tobaeco equivalents to cigarettes as indicated in table S.

The quantities smoked, which aro tabulated, represent tho record given for tbo patient's earliest smoking habits. This amount is thus assumed to exist throughout the timo (ho patient smoked, This period wat to* lected, rather than tho period for the maximum ever smoked, or the period of most recent smoking, since It roprescntt tho interval farthest removed from development of the {lines* iu question. It is avium cd, in conformity with experience- with carcinogen* iu experimental animals, tbat if smoking is' canccr-produciug, that indulged tn fust prior to disease is less important than that Indulged in at a more remote time/

For each class of illness and typo of smoking, the average ages at diagnosis end at onset of smoking, and the average duration of smoking, were computed. Those data are not presented since no differences of epperopt significance wero developed,

Tho average ages at diagnosis were also calculated for each class of illness according to quantities smoked. If tmokiog were etiologically related to cancer it might bo expected a priori that those smoking tho largest amounts would dovelop Illness at a younger age than those smoking smaller amounts, These data are not shown, but no'regular relationship was discernible between average ago ot diagnosis and quantities of toboeco of varlout types smoked.

Method of Computation of Prevalence Rates

Tbe method generally employed In demonstrating an association between tobacco smoking and cancer has been to compare a supposedly representative group of cancer patients with another group, selected as controls, on tbe basis of tho percentage of smokers and nonsmokers in each group. TTbilo this procedure may demonstrate significant differences In the pcrcentngct of tmokort in.tbe groups compared, it provides no estimate of the magnitude of the relative risk of cancer among those wbo tmoko and those who do not.

The procedure utilised in this study estimates relative risk of cancer tmong smokers and nonsmokers on tbe basts of prevalence rates computed by a method due to Cornfield (?). Tbe two assumptions Involved In computing these rates are also implicit in any comparison of a group of cases with coutrol individuals such as those mado iu tho previous studies mentioned. Thcso assumptions are a) that insofar as prior history of smoking Is concerned, tho patients interviewed comprised o representative sample

of all cases of cancer at tho particular site and 6) that the controls inter* viewed timllariy comprised a rcpresentativa sample of individuals eseapiog cancer at that alto. Estimation of tho magnitude of the relative prevalence of cancer among tmokort and nonsmokert requires, additionally, t knowledge of tht approximate prevalence of that cancer in the population from which cases and controls were drawn.

Cornfield's formula (7) for computing prevalence rates of cancer among tmekert and nontmoktrt It duplicated at table 3. This utilizes for each age group, in each cancer site, tbe percentage of smoker* and nonsmokers in patieott with cancer and in control individuals, and the agc*specino prevalence ratt for cancer at tbat site in tho general population. The latter rates utilized In this study are shown in table 4 and were calculated from rates of prevalence found In 1937 in surveyed areas of tbe United States as published by Bom ().

Estimated FnsvAMxeE or Oakceu Auoxo Smokem and NoxaMOKwa

Estimates of cancer prevalence rates among smokers and nonsmokers have been computed hy the method outlined abort. In table 0 these rates art git-en for each class of illness, by ago of patient at diagnosis, end by typo of smoking indulged in. U is observed that though alt orations of rates result front age standardization! these difference* do not materially affect tbe broad associations developed. For this reason subsequent consideration will be limited to crude rates, except, in tbe Instance of certain comparison* of results in this ttudy with those of other worker*.

In table 6 estimated crude proraleuco rates are given for each class of illness and for each typo of smokingthose smoking only cigarettes, cigars . or pipes and those smoking some combination of them. In table 7 similar ratet are presented for caoh site of cancer according to the quao* titles of tobaeco smoked per day. For convenience of discussion, pertinent data from these three tables will be considered for each typo of cancer separately.

Canetr of the ftp.Estimated rates significantly * higher than in non-smokers are found (tabio 0) for those,smoking pipes only, nnd for iboio smoking oigarettes and pipes or cigars and pipes. In these smoking clatset the ratios of the rates for smokers to nentmokcr* vary from 2.6 to S.7. Tho rotes for those vith other smoking habits, including those tmokfog a combination of cigarettes, cigar*, and pipes era not significantly excessive.                                                  * .

In table 8 It is noted that excessive rates era found In every ago class for pipe and "mixed" smokers, but that no such regular relnlionship obtains for other types of smoking. It is further observed in teblo 7 that a regular relationship between quantities smoked end increased, rates it only observed among pipe and "raised" smokers.

These facts, taken together, warrant the assumption that the association between plpp smoking and cancer of tho lip is probably real in this tcriet of patients.

Cannr of the tong\t.t*-lt\ this class of patients exccisivo rates ware estimated (table 6) for those smokiug either pipe* or oigart; for those smoking pipes and cigars; end for those smoking cigarettes and pipes'. Tbe ratios of the rates among tuch smoker* to nonsmokers varied from 3.5 to 6.2, When ago-specific rates ire considered (table 5) the rates are regularly excessive In all classes of tmokert. With regard, however, to quantities smoked (table 7), rates increase regularly with quantity only among tha "mixed" smokers,

Because of these inconsistencies and the relatively small numbers of cases represented for each subdivision of smoking history, somo.doubt must remain as to whether or not the association apparont between pipe and cigar smoking and cancer of tho tongue fa real in patients of this series. Other oral tavity cancer.For oancer of the oral cavityexclusive of cancer of the tonguotlgnlfieantly excessive rates are estimated (table 6) for those smoking only clears or pipes and for those smoking cigars and pipes combined. The ratio of these rates to that for nonsmokers varies from 3.5 to 0.0 When age-speelrlo rates aro considered (table 5) they ore regularly excessive for tho aamo type of tmokert. The relationship be* tween .quantity smoked and rates (table 7) Is regular, however, only for the "mixed" and pipe smokers.

It may therefore bo concluded that on association 'between pipe and possibly' cigar smoking and oancer of tht oral cavity ia apparent in this series of cases.

Cancer of the pkurym,-^Beforouce to tables 5,6, and 7 will show that there Is no suggestion whatsoever of any association botwtcu any type of smoking and pharyngeal cancer tn this series of cases. Tht number of cases available for review is small, however.

Oancer of Me ei0pAa0i(.-~$ignJftaanlly excessive rates are estimated (tablo 0) for those smoking cigarettes only and for all smokers. Tho ' rates for thorn smoking other type* of tobacco, including those with cigarettes in various combinations, are greater than in tiontmokcri, but not significantly to. There it similarly no regular relationship shown (table 7) betweou quantities smoked and tncrcaso in rates. Thus, though an association between cigarette smoking and cauoor of tho esophagus Is suggested, it cannot bo regardod is demonstrated in this small series of cases.

Cancer ef the fary/M?.It is observed in loblo 5 that significantly excessive laryngeal cancer re tea are estimated for those smokiug cigarettes only and for thoto smoking cigarettes and pipes combined, and cigarettes, cigars, and pipesin combination. Tho ratios ot rates among such smokers to nonsmokers vary from 3,6 to 5.2. With regard to use-specific rates (table 5) a regular relationship Is thovu, but it also exists for other claites of smokers. Estimated rales aro also seen (table 7) to increase with Intensity of tmokiog for all types of smoking, except cigars alone.

These data considered together, apparently warrant tho conclusion that there is an association between clgaretto smoking and. laryngeal cancer in this series of cases.

Tho ratios of the rates estimated for smokers and nonsmokers vary between 3.7 and 6.5. A regular relationship is also observed (table 5) hi ige-speclfio rates. Simi-larty, (table 7) rates lucrcasc with Intensity of smoking for cigorette smokers end for pipe smokers but not for the other types.

These observations therefore justify the conclusion that in this uric* ef owes there it an association between cigarette smoking and cancer o( tht lung.

rates have not been computed for tho "mixed" smokers because of the lack of the largo numbers of cases required to make tho many subdivisions of tbe data necessary to accomplish this satisfactorily.

As Levin, Goldstein, and Qerhardt (6*) havo pointed out, however, duration of smokiug is related to age. To take account of the possibility that tho relationship between risk of eauoer and duration of smoking, at -shown In Appendix Table A, may bo a simple function of age, the data for cancer of tho lung and of tho Up havo been reassembled and rates cttim&ted In three ago groups divided according to duration and typo of smoking.

For cancer of the hmg these data are glvon in table 8; Among those smoking cigarettes only, patients within the same ago group do show a slight tendency toward higher rates for the longer duration of smoking. This tendency, however, is irregular and a larger series of eases is necessary to teat it adequately. For those smoking cigarottet in combination with other types the tame tendeney is not apparent, though again the number* of eases available In each class ore too small for reliable conclusions.

Similar data for cancer of tho Up are given in tablo 6, When age ot diagnosis Is kept constant there is no evidence that increased duration of

134S              fOVRKAti or THE .VATlONAt CANCER CtfTtTOS

pipe tmoklng increases risk of this type of cancer.  Again, however, the numbers of cases available are too few to permit reliable conclusions.

These data, however, do appear sufficient to rtlse tome question as to the significance heretofore aiuchcd to dura tlou of tmoklng, Until a large enough series of cases Is available to take account of age, It is not possible to determine whether or not tbe apparent relationship is real or Is an artifact due to tbe age of tho patltntt.

Methods mid Findings Compared With Tboto of Other Studies Sources or Data

At noted previously, tho studies of Schrck, Baker, Ballard, and Dolgeff (f), Wynder and Graham (2), I.cvin, Goldstein, and Qerhavdt (8), Doll and HUi (4), and Mills and Porter (d), as well om tho present onef all employed tho familiar oate-bistory method. Patient* interviewed for retro-apeetlre history of smoking were those coming to specified hospitals in al] but two studlesWjmder and Graham (*), and Mills and Porter (5). In tht former, prlvato patientt'wero tlso Included,and in tho latter,.Hats of names for interview of survivor* were obtained from death certificates. Interviews were conducted either by trained lay Interviewers or by physicians, except in tbe ttudy of Mills nod Porter (5) who mailed questionnaires to survivors of lung-cencer decedents, In none of these studies, including the preseut one, con tho patients Interviewed be regarded ai completely representative samples of til lung canoer occurring in definable populations.

The types of individuals selected for comparison ("controls") varied, though in all but one study thoy consisted essentially of patients with illnesses other than lung cancer. The major exception, that ot Mills end Porter (5) consisted of residents of Columbus, Ohio, interviewed in house-to-house visits,

BtriKiTioxi or foots*!

Smokers wero defined in each of the six studies as follows:

o) Schrck et of. (f) defined cigarette smoking at tho use of 10 or more cigarettes per day; "moderate" smokers being those using 10-20 cigarette**, and "heavy," those smoking more than that. They did not consider pipe or cigar tmoklng.

5) Wynder and Oroham {2) grouped smokers in 5 classes (light smokersthose using 1 to 0 cigarettes per day for more titan 20 ycorsup to chain smokers, who used 35 or more per day for at km 90 years). Pipe and cigar smokers were included by counting 1 cigar as 5 cigarettes and 1 pipeful as 2'( cigarette*.

a) Levin if al. (d) included thote who "had ever smoked," with ho specification of quantities wed. They elo provided tabulations for cigar and pipe smokers.

With regard to lung canoer, therefore, all of tho studies cited showed t significant association between smoking and that disease. In addition, Schrek and co-workers noted an association botween'cigaretto tmoklng tnd cancer of the larynx and pharynx; and Levin and co-workers an association between pipe smoking and cancer of the lip.

CoupAnisoxa iv Txrms or Relative; Risk of Lvsra Oaxcor

With the data at band, it it possible to compare In more detaQ the present study with those of Wynder and Graham (?) end Doll and Hill (4). ' Prevalence rates of cancer of the tung per 100,000 white males wore estimated for tmokert and nonsmokers from tho data recorded In these three studios, These rates, calculated by tho Cornfield method (7), aro given in table 10 for several ago classes by quantities smoked. For the tabulation* shown, cigars and pipe tobacco have been converted to their tobacco equivalents hi cigarettes, and total rates are standardised for ago for each study, This table -alio shout the relative prevalence of lung cancer among smokers and no nsmokori.

It will bt noted that iu each study the groupings differ slightly according to quantities smoked. In addition, clitlcrcnt factors are used for eouver* slon of pipe tobacoo and cigars into their cigarette equivalents. These variations in classification reduce in detail tht companions which are possible, It should bo noted also, that itt spite of tbe relatively largo number of cases and controls In each ttudy, the number* available are small for computation of rates in many ago*and smoking daises.

In spite of these considerations several facts appear evident in the comparisons shown. Fin I, It is clear iu all threo studies that the estimated rate is significantly greater in smokers than In nonsmokers. - Tht relative prevalence, however, varies from 5 ia tho present study to 14 in tho others. Second, among smokers (hero is a gimeral tendency manifest in ell studies, toward nu incrcaio iu rotes with increased quantify* smoked daily. Some peculiarities in this tendency aro manifest, however. In both tho Wynder and Qraham and tho preieut ttudy, this tendency is quite irregular for patients of GO yeeri of ago and over

for the larger quantities smoked. At least a part of such discrepancies Is due to tht tmall number of caset availablo in these classes; In the Doll and Hill study the discrepancies noted for the older agM and larger quantities smoked are not apparent.

Discussion

It is quite- trident from this study, as well at the others diseutsed, that an association exists between smoking and cancer of the lung among the cases Interviewed. It is also dear tbat cigarette smoking is tho principal form responsible for tho demonstrated association. A0y of thete or other similar studies, taken olono, would hardly Juittfy the conclusion that the association is real, since it is evident that none of them qualify as comprising representative samples of ell lung cancer occurring in males from any definable population, Since, however, a number of ttudlct conducted by slightly different techniques, in different geographic regions, and among varying patient populations ail point in the tame direction, It appears highly likely thai the association Is not only statistically significant, but alto real.

Gomplete confidence in its genulueness, and more precise measurement of its degree are not likely to be attained, however, by further repetition of this typo of Investigation". General exporiencc attests to (he practical difficulties involved in obtaining a representative sample of eases, or In selecting and Interviewing a completely adequate control group for comparison. Such difficulties are at likely to appear in future case-history studies as have been evident in these. Population studies rather than case-history studiesprojected into the future, are probably required for more complete toiling of this aisoclotlon and for a more precise estimate of its degree Judging, however, by the accumulated evidence lo date it would bo surprising if such studies did not generally confirm tht findings of this and previous investigations.

It should be pointed out that an association between cancer end  some typo of tracking hat been demonstrated or suggested for each site under review here, except cancer of tbe pharynx. The question may therefore be raised as to whether this evidence indicates an aiw-elation between smoking and cancer tn general, rather than betweeu it and these specific sites, The data of Schrck, Baker, Ballard, oud Dolgoff (/} and Levin, Ooldsteln, and Gcrhardt (9), utilizing k?o series of "other iltet" as controls, do not support an hypoiheiii of a general aiieoiation. Their grouping of a number of tins, however, might conceivably have masked existing associations for some of the individual sites they Included.

Assuming that present evidence Justifies tho conclusion that cigarette smokers aro more likely to develop lung cancer than nontmokeri, tht question remaios at to whether the smoking of cigarettes Is of Ittolf responsible for tho increased risk. Othar authors hare presented cvj* deuce in conformity with tho view that cigarette smokiug has weak ' carcinogenic effects and ia thus of Important etiological significance.

Certain observations In this study tre not necessarily consistent with that view.

It it common practice to note the association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer and relate thit observation to the parallel increase ia ciga-' rettt contumptiou and lung caneer during recent years. In this study on association of about the same degree as that observed with eenccr of tht lung hat been shown between cancer of tht larynx and cigarette tmoklng. A phenomenal increase in eancer of the larynx, such as that recorded for cancer of tho lung, hat not been observed Ia this country. If the association between cigarette smoking end lung cancer is of etiological significance some explanation is needed as to why a corresponding increase In laryngeal cancer hot not followed an increase in cigarette consumption, with wliich thit disease is also associated.

These data also provldo no evidence that age at onset of disease is in* fluenced by tbe quantities of cigarettes smoked. While the laek of auch evidence may ho duo to an insuflleleot number of cases, no suggestion of an increased average age at onset with decrease in cigarettes usedt was evident. This point needs testing In other series since one might expect tueh t cor* relation if cigarettes were of etiological significance.

In the tamt fashion these data provide no firm evidence that rltk in-' creases with Increase in duration of tmokiog. When ago wot kept constant no clear-cut trend in this direction was apparent, At pointed out, how* ever, the number of cases available in this series Is insufficient to test this point adequately. Levin, Goldstein, and Gerhardt (&*) recognized a possible Independent association between age at onset end duration of smoking but, since their smoker* of leit than 2i years' duration wero few in number, it Is not clear whether or not their method of testing aceouutod for .ago adequately,

It would therefore appear that though the association between cigarette smoking end lung cancer seems real, the significance of thit association remains unettablishod.

Summary and Conclusions

Retrospective smoking histories ef 1,000 patients with cancer of tho lip, tongue, other oral cavity, phntju.?, esophagus, larynx, and lung were analyzed and compared with those of 015 patients with illnesses other than cancer. Comparisons were mode of percentages of smoker* In each group, at well as in terms of tho magnitude of relativo risk of cancer among smokers and uonsmokeri, The findings were alto compared with those of several other recently recorded studies.

The magnitude of the relative risk of csneer at each site among tmokert and nonsmokers wut measured by converting tho proportion! of tmokert In test and control groups into prevalence rates of cancer. Thit conversion is dependent upon the assumptions that the tmoklng history of tht controls Is representative of tho smoking history ef the noneanccr popiuV tton, end that tho rmoklog histories for taoh otacer ttte art representative of all cancer at such sites.

An ossoeiation between smokiug end cancer wet considered to be demonstrated in this series of cases if all of the following condition! were met:

1.  Tbo rato in tmokert wet significantly higher than In sonsmokert at a probability level of Pm ,01 or lees j

2.  There was a fairly good direct relationship between quantities smoked end estimated rates;

3.  Tho agc*spccifio rates in tmokert of a particular type exceeded and generally paralleled thoso estimated for nonsmokers; and

4.  That for" mixed smokers" rates wero excessive among those practicing the type of smoking Under suspicion* though in combination with another typo. .

. On the basis of these general criteria tt Is concluded that tho following associations are demonstrated iu thit series; a) between pipe smoking end cancer ot the lip, b) between cigarette tmokiog and laryngeal cancer, and e) between cigarette tmoklng and canoer of tht lung.

Additional associations are suggested but aro not beUevod to bo demon* ttrated in this series, namely; a) between pipe tod cigar smoking and canoer of tho tongue, o) between pipe end possibly cigar tmoklug tnd other cancer of the oral cavity, and e) between cigarette tmokiog and cancer of the esophagus.

There was no suggestion at all of any association between pharyngeal cancer and smoking of any typo.

Since previous studies of a similar xutturo have also demonstrated association between theso types of smokiug and eancer of the lip, larynx, and lung, it It concluded that these associations are real.

The magnitudo of the relative risk of lung cancer among smokors and nonsmokers, which hot been demonstrated m this ttudy, has been com* pared to that found In two other studies. In this ttudy tbo rate Id smokers was estimated to .bo 5 times that In nonsmokers, while iu tbe other two it waa 14.

Aside from tho statistical significance and apparont realncss of these associations there remains the question of whether smokiug is etiologically related to lung cancer. Considerations aro presented which lead to tho conclusion that the etiological tlgnlflcance of these associations remains unestaltithed.

Doll and Hit also conclude that previous lung ditetsct are of m|

i A positive association between wioklng and lung cincer his now been shown In twelve recent, separate studies, covering more than 6,ooo iung cancer patients. It has been stated that some doubt may bo thrown on ell of these studies because they differ in degree of ttsocfotion found. In this respect it mutt be roftllfccd they differed basically In the kind of interviews usedL Some of them, for mfttnoe, were biitcd nn mure or less routine hospital record*, whcrcai orhent were made by spceitlly designed Interview-*, The studio* tho differed tt to smoking tlactirtcariom and the types of tobacco used. Finally, they differed In type of lung caneer eases, with only a few trudlc.i Imitung on hhtologlc proof.

In view of these difference* It li perhaps turpriilng that all showed n definite association between trucking and lung cincer* The studies by Doll tnd Hill tnd by Wynder tnd Graham ihowod especially close agreement, Levin has calculated the per cent of lung cancer attributable to imoking and found it to bo Tit come studio* as low at $6 per cent, end io others, such at those by Doll and Mil and hy Wynder and Graham, as high as oo pir coot.1* Even if we were to accept only the lower value of em* elation, it teems still high enough to warrant oor utmost attention.

In a recent study from the National Cancer ftvtd-tute by Sadowtky, Gilliam and Cornfield, 477 lung

ported Jumr canoor survey*.** The author* concluded that, in view of the fact that 10 miny different Investigitom, using different groups of long cancer patients and control group*, all arrived at similar conctuiIons, it mutt he aitumed that the iwodation between lung cancer tnd smoking is rctl In t recent symposium on lung cincer sponsored by the WHO and UNESCO, the stsootstion between invoking tnd lung cancer was also regarded at established.' The New Bntfrnd fotmut of Medlchie in  recent edl* rorial coniidered present "evidence of to association between cigarette smoking 8od lung cancer 10 strong a* to bo considered proof within the everyday meaning of the word.""

There ha* been a remarkable change in to* ratio in lung cancer over the past few decadet. In 1911 Adlcrt repon gave a ratio of j males to 1 feimle. Some of the more recently collected lung caneer scries hive given lex ratios as high ti 14 to t.1' If tho icx ratio wore given only for epidermoid lung cancer the sex ratios would be even more predominantly male. A survey by Moersch and McDonald gave a ratio of 1; to t for epidermoid lung canoer and only j to t for adenocarcinoma of tha lung,*1 Tho Inoretitng male tent ratio strongly tiwgtft* the responsible factor to be tn tgent to which male* have been exposed more and over a longer period of time than women. In thb respect It hat been often stared that women tmoke at much as men do today. In view of tho canoer age and the long latent period of oancer Induction tht tmoklng habits of die young women have no effect on the prcient sex ratio. In t study of ftmtle controls In the cancer ig it the Burner Hospital we found thit tbout lo per ocne were nonsmokers tnd that but very few of these women hid smoked heavily for ic least twenty yean.1* The present set rtdo tt therefore twite com* patlble with the long*torm tmoklng habits of the two sexes. On the other hind, there Is no avidenoe thtt women who smoke tre rwhtant to long cancer. Soma ilto In long canoer, as stated previously, Is also noted among women.

Future studio! expanding on the problem of the correlation of tobacco tnd cancer Involve clinical ti well ai continued laboratory effort*. Retrospective clinical data are perhaps no longer needed, since a sufficient number of studio* presented quite timllar data and conclusions. The so-called "forward studies" being carried out by Hammond tnd Horn on general population, by Dorn on U.

These studios will he able to glvt os a good idea of the relative risk of long cancer among different types of smoker*. Early results from the

continued increase among males tod the changing cohort dlitribution of lung caneer. The studies mu| determine whether the tobacco dm continue to be compatible with such changing incidence date.

Perhaps the greatest effort must be placed oo animal experimentation.

We are aware that cancer Is a diteast of multiple cauier, some of which axe endogenous and some of tthlch may be exogenout. We tuo realise thtt other erogenous factor* may play t role in tht development of lung cancer, including some industrial agents, and that air pollution may be a cofictor. We know that epidermoid cancer of the lung may occur in tho alienee of a smoking history, though this 1* exceedingly rare, particularly If we exclude the cum of occupational exposure!. We ak> know rhtt not ill who smoke develop lung cincer and that, as to ill other dhcisui, the factors of internal resistance come Into play,                            ,

While realising the Importance of other fictott in the development of lung cancer, wo must also admit that wo do not comprehend many of thoto fictott. Therefore, it seam*, we mutt concentrate on those factors that we undentsnd today. Tho tobacco factor Is such a ftctor. In developing preventive mctkuret, wo must employ those that tre available, tint we understand, thetiro most practical, ind that Involve tho greatest majority of our population.

Lung concer is already very common today. In Kngland it now account! for *p> per cent of all male concer deaths between tht tge* of forty.fivo end fifty-four and for at per cent of all male cancer deaths. fttathttcitns tgroo thit the incidence will continue to increase, while tc the lime time the mortality from lung cancer continues to bo alarm* Ingly high, Because of the anatomic distribution of lung cancer, an earlier and tnoro luemful treatment will prove most difficult, unless we develop tn entirely new concept of Cancer therapy.

that we must rely chiefly on preventive measure! as nur greatest hope against this diteaff.

YOUNG TURKS-OLD TUEKS

IT IS gratifying to discover that sophlttt* | oatton in clinical investigation, which is almost synonymous with academic medicine, doe* not necessarily scorn the romantic, At least the emotional troplsm that draws us to an institution or to an organization may be powerful enough to counteract any stigma of sen-timentaltsm when one is assigned the honor of assembling the chronicle* of such an organization, so that the present will not forget the past. In a recent fssue of tho Journal of Clinical Investigation (special Issue, 38(17834876, Oct. fat, 2] 1959), a special supplement edited by Ellen R. Brainard was devoted exclusively to a recounting of significant events in the formation, early days of struggle, and rapid development of a coterie of cUnicalin-vestigfltors Into a community of scholars known as the American Society for Clinical Investigation-tlie Young Turks,

The person responsible for tlie idea was Dr. Samuel J. Meltzer, Husslnn-bom and German-trained, a transatlantic ship's doctor until he was attracted permanently to the United States in 1883. At the age of 53 he abandoned a lucrative practice of medicine in Harlem to become associated with the newly established Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. For *ome time the eponym for the American Society for Clinical Investigation was tbe Meltwr Verein, in honor of this distinguished scientist and in deference to his Teutonic training. Aocording to the best recollection, tho idea for the society wa* founded on the boardwalk in Atlantic City, after a session of the American Medical Association in 1907. The first meeting of the society

occurrod two year* Inter. The members were Identified as Young Turk* to emphailae the revolt against the Association of American Physician*, the Old Turks, The prevailing sentiment in the founding of the American Society for Clinical Investigation was the unwritten pledge to foster the evolution of the young investigators into wise pro* fessors of our medical faculties. Just 18 years after the society was founded the mat issue of their periodical, the Journal of CWnlcoI InuesNgAtfon, was published.

Concomitant with tho eomoilatton* of the history of the Young Turks, two*01d Turks In formal academic, .but not intellectual, retirement have been laboring to bring up-to-date the records for their respective corporate structures. Dr. J. Howard Means, one-time Jackson professor of medicine at Harvard Medical Sohool, one-time member of the editorial board of tho A. M. A. Awhlvos of Internal (MerHd'ne, and one-time president of the Anooiatidn of American Physicians, b preparing the history of the association during its 75 years of growth. Also, Dr, C, Sidney Burwell, one-time dean of Harvard Medical Sohool and one-time professor of research medicine at Harvard, Is compiling a history of this institution of learning for the first naif of the current century, It it suspected that there will be considerable overlapping in persons and project* in those three significant dooument*.

The American Society for Clinical Investigation hat a competition of about 275 active members. Many of the Young Turks in the original roster remained In clinical Investigation unci, by the time their turn came for graduation to Old Turks, were elected to membewhip in the A**oolation of American Physicians, The current panel of emeritus membors of the society contains the names of almost 500 physicians and medical scientists. Last, the history of the society lists almost ISO Old'Turks who have Joined their patient*. Whether active, emeritus, or in the third category whoso activity remains unknown, the vast majority have been dedicated to research, tbe pursuit of clinical Investigation, and the teaching of the art ai well as the science of medicine to pregraduate and to postgraduRto disciples.

To paraphrase A. Lincoln, the world will soon forget what i* snid here but it will long remember what they did here, There are several Nobel laureates on the registry of the society. The dean* of medical schools are a* abundant at the seeds in n watermelon, while the number of professors In medical school* are a* "thick as autumnal leave* that strow the brooki in Vallombro*a.? Whether one look* kindly or not on those who pursue investigation and are dedicated rtrmiltftneotwly to bedside teaching, this conclusion teems Inescapable: The inventory of Young Turks and Old Turk* is intrinsic to the tremendout progress in the art and practice of medicine lo America since the beginning of

this century. The history of the Society of Clinical Investigation is an Intriguing document. We await with anticipation a *imllar volume of the Society of Old Turk* as well at tlie hiitory of the last half-century of the Harvard Medloal School, where so many teachers of medicine received a modicum or a significant portion of their formal professional education.

BIOCHEMICAL ASPECTS OF ERYTHROCYTE FORMATION

The mature erythrocyte consists of about 90% hemoglobin by dry weight; the remainder I* stroma and an Impressive array of enzymes. Some of tlie*e enzyme* are concerned with oxygen and carbon dioxide transport while other* may be vestige* of previous existence as a cell capable of division, Recent investigations have contributed to the undemanding of tlie mechanism* Involved in biosynthesis of various components of the red blood cell. Interest has been focused principally on the manner of hemoglobin synthesis,

Understanding of tlie biochemistry of heme synthesis had Its inception in the discovery of Shemin and Rittenberg' that glycine labeled with fcotoplc nitrogen (N*) administered to animals gives rise to erythrocyte heme containing N". With this observation as the foundation almost the entire blosynthetlc pathway of heme has been elucidated. Rapid advance* In this field followed qnlukly upon the finding by Shemin and his colleagues* and by investigator* In England that heme lyndiesi* could be studied in vitro with use of avian erythrocyte*, reticulocytes, or hemolysatc* of these colls, The well-documented sequence of reaction* by which heme is formed is as follows,

Glycine condenses with an activated succinate derivative (probably succlnyl coenzyme A), to yield -amfoo-j9-keto edipic acid which either en*y-matically or spontaneously lose* a earboxyl group to become 8-amlno levulinic add. Two molecules of Jamtno levulinic Rdd condense to form the pyrrole, porphobilinogen. The enayme carrying out tills oomlensation appear* to be a cooper-containing, sulfhydryl enzyme. The detailed mechanism of'how fonr porphobilinogen molecule* condense, lose six carboxyf groups, and form two double bond* in the side chains resulting in protoporphyrin

is still not clear, It teems probable that uroporphyrin and coproporphyria (containing eight and six earboxyl groups, respectively) are not direct precursors but arc for mod from intermediates whioh also yield protoporphyrin. The more direct precursors may be the porphyrinogens, i. &, the reduced forms of the porphyrins.

There Js lUll doubt concerning the step at which the iron Is incorporated into the molecule. Experiments with chicken erythrocyte hemolyxates have shown the possibility of an eoayrnio reaction between ferrous iron and protoporphyrin to yield heme. This reaction also occur* nonentymioally. Evidence derived from experiment* with liver mitochondria substantiates the enzymlc pathway. It is not certain whether tlie iron is derived from ferritin or directly from transform (riderophilin). The mechanism of reduction of the ferric to the ferrous form need* to he clarified.

The other part of the hemoglobin molecule, globin, has been the subjeot of Intensive studyu as one example of protein synthesis, It appears likely that globin is formed by the same type of reaction sequence as are other proteins, The procoss by which globin is linked to heme i* uncertain, although model experiments have ahown tbat analogous reactions ooour spontaneously.

Under normal conditions tlieforroation of globin and of .heme keep pace with each other so that no accumulation occurs of either exceti porphyrin or protein. The mechanism of thl* fine degree of regulation poses an interesting, Important, and as yet unsolved problem,

Tlie biochemiofll role of cyanocobalnmine (vita-mine B) which hat such a striking effect in restoring normal maturation of erythrotd cells in pernicious anemia, has not been established, Since vitamin*, at least those whose chemical function* ate understood, are ooostitpent* of ooemymes, attempt* have been made to fbd a coenwmic role for tills vitamin, Reports have appeared of the participation of cyanocobalamlne In reactions involving deoxyriboslde formation, incorporation of amino acids into protelni, reduction of the hydroKymethyl

?;roup of serine and transfer to homocyrttae to orm methionine, and in the formation of the methyl group of thymine. None of the*e reaction* account* for the high degree of specificity of the maturation arrest characteristic of nernicfoiw anemia and the dramatic release of this maturation arrest by minute amount* of the vitamin.

In the last few years evidence has iiccumulated which firmly establishes the hypothesis of Carrot * Indicating tho existence of a hormone which regulates erythropoiesi*. This factor, erythropoietin (nematopoletin, hemopofetine) appear* in small amount* in normal blood and in elevated amounts in response to either anemic anoxia or anoxic anoxia In many specie*, including man. The administration of oobaltou* chloride to experimental animals also

results in increased plasma titers of erythropoietin, This finding probably explains the polycythemia-producing effect of cobalt. While It has not yet been completely purified, this hormone is apparently a glycoprotein. It is relatively heat and acid stable but ia inaptlvated by proteolytic enfcymes,

There is evidence indicating that in the experimental animal erythropoietin is formed in the kidney, Such an origin for erythropoietin may *erve to explain the anemias associated with renal disease and the polycythemia sometimes present in conjunction with hypernephroma, There have been no re-' ports of the use of erythropoietin in the treatment of anemias In man.

Although the *tudie reveal a relationship between dgarette imoking and cancer that aooms more than coincidental, they do not explain why, even when smoking patterns are the aame, case rates are higher among men than among women and among urban than among rural populations. Neither tbe proponents nor tho opponent! of the imoking theory have sufficient evidence to warrant the assumption of an all-or-none authoritative position.

Surgeon Generate Report

have only begun to show its vast health consequences, In 1965/ an estimated 180,000 persons died from smoking-related disease* (USDHHS 1989); over the next two decades, that yearly estimate increased to 337,000, even though smoking prevalence had been steadily declining since the early 1970s (USDHHS 1989). First-time or long-time smokers in the mid'1960 to mid-1970s thus had far less opportunity than the next generation to personally witness the tragic but convincing demonstration of the health consequences of smoking. It might be hypothesiwd that this somber proof of the Surgeon General's report at last evoked a meaningful response among the surviving relatives and friends of the deceased.

From Disease Treatment to Risk Management

Another possible reason for the delayed response to the Surgeon General's report was its less-than-traditional medical perspective. The report's medical researchers were reporting not the kind of traditional clinical data that physicians were used to encountering in their literature but rather data from epidemiologic studies that indicated the risks of smoking. Eventually, such data would be persuasive enough to mark a perceptual shift to *a new kind of numeracy among medical researchers and clinicians alike" (Bumham 1989, p, 19). But in 1964, most physicians were not prepared to understand-much less be per-auaded bythe epidemiologic data represented in the report, nor to incorporate a public health model Into their medical practice.

Accordingly, the medical profession did not quickly jump on the smoking reduction bandwagon that began rolling with the Surgeon General's report. The American Medical Association Alliance House of Delegate*, In fact, refused to endorse the report when it appeared in 1964 (Bumham 1989). Medical personnel increasingly warned people against smoking, but this precept did not carry over into practice, In 1964, smoking remained aa acceptable in medical setting! as it was elsewhere. Moreover, although 95 percent of physicians in that year saw smoking as hazardous, 25 percent continued to smoke (Bumham 1989); even by the mid-1970s, nearly one in five physicians waa a smoker (Nelson et al. 1994). The AMA was criticized by other health organizations for not taking a more aggressive stance to reduce tobacco use. As late aa 1982, for example, the association was faulted for helping prepare for Newsweek a 16-page "personal health care" supplement/ In which the only advice provided

on smoking was that a smoker ahould discuss the risks with a persona) physician and should refrain from smoking in bed (Iglehart 1984). Soon thereafter, the AMA had become art active advocate (see "Toward a National Policy to Reduce Smoking," later In this chapter). By 1990-1991, only 3.3 percent of physicians smoked, although smoking rates among nurses were significantly higher (Nelson et al. 1994).

Some social critics of the time tacitly welcomed what they saw as a rare reluctance by the establishment to embrace a social movement. Sociologists and other outside observers of American medicine had noted a previous tendency of the establishment to "medicaltee* social problems, such as tobacco use and alcohol abuse. From this perspective, medicine was viewed askance as an "institution of social control," as a "new repository of truth, the place where absolute and often final judgments are made by supposedly morally neutral and objective experts" (Zola 1972, p. 487), Implicit in this criticism was the fear that the medical establishment was using ita considerable cloutits professional domination of the world of factsto translate all social ills into clinical terms that could be treated In a clinical setting. One such critic, medical sociologist Eliot Freldson, wrote that the physician who calls alcoholism a disease "is as much a moral entrepreneur as a fundamentalist who claims It isasln"<Freidsonl974,p.253).

But the medical establishment's Initial hesitancy to join the movement to reduce smoking likely had little to do with scruples about overstepping Its pur-view. There Is no dispute that cancer Is a disease and tittle dispute that the medical profession Is die expert social authority for defining and treating it The "moral entrepreneurshlp" of the Surgeon General's 1964 report was not to declare cancer a medical problem but rather to declare smoking a health riskhence the central position of epidemiologic data in the report,

Thus, while organized medidne followed slowly and sometimes reluctantly In the wake, and while so* del skeptics worried about the Orwellian Implications, a battery of public health official*, politicians, and consumer advocates, armed with the findings of the Surgeon General's report, moved against the persisting social and medical problem of smoking, Ultimately, the broad cultural current (hatdistrusted medical moral entrepreneurshlp embraced theae efforts, The "de-medical Wng" movement/ which sought to make health care both a personal matter and a political matter rather than one wholly under the guardianship of physicians (Starr 1982), supported a practice of medicine that took a preventive atance Instead of an exclusively therapeutic one.

PREFACE

The information gathered between the covers of this monograph haa been compiled from more than 6000 articles published in some 1200 journals up to and largely into the year 1959; these have been read and analytleally abstracted during a cumulative total of some 60 yeara' interest of the authors in the biological and medical effect4 of tobacco. Although the resultant monograph la primarily directed to the research worker and specialist in a wide variety of fields, the authors truit tbat readers with broad interests, and ia particular physicians, will nevertheless find many sections of the book of much value and appeal. The clinical chapters alone comprise a considerable portion of the text; and perhapa the authors may venture to suggest here that certain of their discussions of both experimental and clinical data are not without what may be termed tmnsexperimental and supra-clinical implications,

We gratefully acknowledge grant-in-aid aupport from the Tobaooo Industry Research Committee during the final atages of this long project. We deem it only proper to inform the reader that all responsibility for tbe data presented and views expressed herein, either explicitly or Implicitly, rests entirely upon the authors, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee aupport having been In accordance with its established policy of leaving complete freedom of planning and action to grant* in-fcid recipients.

Special thanks are due to Dr. Herbert McKennls, 3t Professor of Pharmacology in the Medical College of Virginia, for aseletanoe In organisation of the material on nicotine metabolites presented in Chapter 1.

INTRODUCTION

"I cannot determine what I ought to transcribe, till [ am aatiafied how much I ought to believe."Gibboh, Dtcline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chapter XVI.

The above quotation admirably cxpreesee the quandary In which the authors found themselves at tbe outset of preparation of this monograph. In the thousands of abstract* which had been prepared by two of us (P.8X. and H.B.H.), there was scarcely to be found consistency of data in any area of observation, and unanimity of interpretation was even more rare, yet all too often the reviewer on s smaller scale, through (largely) unavoidable selection of data, has obscured for his reader any realisation of this paramount fact. In view of thia greater evil of selection, our own decision was taken to be deliberately nonselective, printing (as it were) good work and bad, sound and uninformed opinion, alike, in the same sice type. It has thus been our primary purpose to acquaint the reader with the manifold reporta that have oome to our attention, and to try and present enough of their varied content to help him decide whether or not a more detailed perusal of the originals will be helpful to his particular interest. However, the reader will often find himself assisted In the evaluation of individual reports and opinions by the critical analyses of later authors, and whenever It has proved possible to Inject thoughts or reflections of our own, we trust tbat we have achieved some relevancy And order.

The synthesis of this mass of information into a aeemlngly logical pattern was undertaken by H. S., who desires leave to point out that this modest or pejorative adverb may allude to himself, to the material, or even to the reader, aa future die* covery and/or interpretation may decide.

For this monograph does not represent the last word on tobacco, only the millions of words that have been written on the aubject so far, What justifies these millions of words (and our account of a great many of tbem) is tbe simple fact that millions of persons have uaed, do now use, and (short of world catastrophe) will continue to use tobacco.

Lastly, although much time and effort have been devoted to eliminating mechanical errors of transcription and misinterpretations of our authors' meanings, we are acutely cognisant that, in a work of thia magnitude, some must inevitably have escaped our vigilance. We shall welcome any referenoe to these, as welt as to any work which may have escaped our attention, that the generous reeder may care to communicate to us.

TOBACCO

In the ease of several ipeeles of invertebrates, in mhlch the excretion of nicotine proceeded relatively lowly, von Skrem* Ilk (IMS) assumed that a oertain cumulation took place, and tbe new poison added to tbe residual amount* of nicotine In the body intensified the injurious effect.

According to Howat (I915-16), nicotine acted as a cumuli* tlve drug in frog*, lessening the bodily resistance until tb* toxic dose wa* found to be less for the tolerant frog than for the normal one

Gaede (1940) gave 25 female canaries daily aubcutaneou* injection* of 0 00O-O.018 mg./gm, nicotine in increasing do** age At the end of the experiment, the LD waa found to be 0.023 rag /pa- nicotine, compared to an LD of 0,029 mg./gm. in control birds Gaede ascribed the lower LD value to cumu-lative effects of nicotine which were avoided in other experiment* by smaller dosage or longer rest period* (i.e. 0.003 rog./gm. nicotine duly, or 0.000-0.018 mg./gra. every fourth day).

Heuboer and Peplerkowskl (1938) gave a group of mice daily increasing fraction! of the fatal dose of nicotine; during the course of the experiment, the animals showed increasing sensitivity to nicotine rather than a habituation.

Behrend and Thieoes (1931, 1933) injected one group of rats with a twice-daily doee of nicotine juat sufficient to cause tremor or mild convulsions, and a second group of animals Kith maximal injections of nicotine, the dose being regulated by the appearance of dangerous sign*. In the first group, a 30% increase in tolerance to daily minlroil convulsive dotes occurred in 6 months' tune, but in tbe second group, a gradual decrease in dosage had to be effected, from an average initial dose of 4.9 mg./kf  twice daily to 2.2 tog, /kg. 6 month* later. Thus, an increased susceptibility to maxuneldoeei of nicotine developed.

Okumura (1637b, 1933) reported that dogs became more sensitive to nicotine through repeated poisoning. C. W. Ed* munds (1909) bad found that dogs given 5-16 mg. nicotine aubcutaneouily daily showed an increased suioeptiblity to the drug, for the first 6 weeks of the experiment, while animal*

fiven massive (33-100 tag.) doses rapidly became tolerant t is difficult to aee how cumulation oould explain these results, st least,

6o far a* smoking is concerned, F. Cramer (1925b) was led to conclude, on tbe basis of his personal experience, that in old smoker* a quick elimination of nicotine no longer took place; that, rather, an accumulation of nicotine in the body mutt be assumed to occur. Mathers, Patterson aad Levy (1949) found that the maximum circulatory effects occurred after the smoking of the first cigarette, and that ta no case wa* the height of the reaction significantly increased after tha second cigarette. Within the limits of two dgarette*, therefore, there was no evidence of cumulative action. D. G. Chapman (1944) suggested that tobacco headache, fatigue, and clrcula* torv symptom* resulted from the cumulative effect of tobacco, and accounted for the variation* in symptoms among smoker*',

TOBACCO HABITUATION

The terms hsbitustton and addiction, while still used more or less indiscriminately by many writers, have now a generally recognised distinction among pharmacologist* and those con* eeraed with the problem of addiction. Habituation and addiction agree in embracing the phenomena of tolerance and dependence; but dependence upon a habituating drug, and withdrawal symptoms following its discontinuance, are held to be pMhw in nature, while an oddichnf drug Is held to result In physical as well as p*ychic dependence, and withdrawal

lead* to serious and predictable plpneoi as well as mental and

Cychic derangements. According to these definitions then, bttuation and addiction differ in a qualitative sense, tbe test being the absence or presence of phytic*! dependence, which has been defined (Seevert, tn Dnll's textbook Photmcettyy tn Medicine, 2nd ed., 1958) a* a state of "Biochemical, physiologic, and possible morphologic adaptation of tissues to the new chemical environment during repeated use so that the presence of the drug.., now required to permit tbe cell* of hese tissues to function normally... ."* Tiet smoking produces a craving for more w hen an attempt nade to give tt up n undoubted, wrote H. Rotieiton in . 0, but tt oan seldom be accurately described as overpo* er-iu, and to regard tobacco a* a drug of addiction may be all very well in the hutooroui sense, but it u hardly accurate. J, P. Rolleston (1937a, b) was inclined to regard tmokiog a* an addiction, accepting a recent definition by E. W. Adams that addiction we* "a state of bondage to a masterful drug, manifested by craving, tolerance, intense discomfort of a specialised character on withdrawal of the drug, and a tendency to relapse." Most ot the writers on the subject have apparently viewed tobacco-smoking as both a habit and an addiction, depending upon tbe individual aad upon tbe char* acter of the abstinence symptoms (eg. Bofstatter, 1934b; licklnt, 1934b; Korteweg, 1053; DeJoogh, 1954; Run, 1955); some have considered it purely a habit (e g. P. O. Wolff, 1951); some, a purr drug addiction (e,g. L. M. Johnston, 1945a, b, 1947a, 1957a; KoraUui, 1956)} while still other* have preferred to go beyond the conventional definitions of habituation or addiction, and to regard tobacco-smoking from other points of view,

Comparing the tobacco habit to drug addiction, Gles, Kahn and LbnericK (1931) declared that the former is not a drug habit in the sense io which the term Is commonly undemtood, Tbe withdrawal symptoms are not like those exhibited by ordinary drug addicts, and, after breaking the habit of to-beeoo-smoking, tbe desire for the plant does not have any of tbe cumulative physiological force of the specific craving for auch bablt-dnig* as morphine. The craving li chiefly a demand for satisfaction of a psychic impulse, not for the specific effect of nicotine or of anything in tobacco-smoke. Although the psychic factor is unquestionably the most Important one

a tranqmllliing Influence on tobacco-smokers, nor satisfy then acquired fondness for mild forms of tobacco (Git* ef of.). Kos-kcwiki (1955) pointed out that the babltof tobewoemok. tag ha* it* characteristic features: the tobacco which 1* mod appreciated by a wnoker does not always belong to that brand which contains the greatest amount of nicotine. Tbe satisfaction of smoking U not always dependent on the pure physiological action of nicotine on the human organism, Tbe fact that the sudden stoppage of smoking doe* not provoke strong

reactions in the organism indicates that certain differences exist between the tobacco habit and addiction to morphine, opium, beroin, cocaine, and probably hashish or marihuana, as well as other hsbit-fonnlag narcotic drags (Koskowski).

Bofstittter (1934b) felt that a much sharper line of distinction should be drawn between nicotine addiction and smoking than was generally done. Most imokers were cer* tamly only habitual smokers, and If definite harm resulted because of tbe habit, one usually succeeded In persuading this group of persons to restrict and even completely atop tbe consumption of tobacco by explanation and instruction. Some excessive imokers were also nicotine addicts, but tbe nicotine addict was not necessarily an excessive smoker; not a few nicotine addicts were observed to tolerate smoking very badly. Ucldnt (1934b) too pointed out that tbe concept of nicotinism was often erroneously identified with tobacco abuse. The heavy amoker who can stop smoking without showing any abstinence symptoms or desire is a case of tobacco abuse, but not of nicotinism; on the other hand, a smoker of 9 or 8 cigarettes a day may be aa outspoken nloo* tinist if he cannot abstain from thia small quantity without psychic or organic manifestations.

In contrast to the view ol HofstStter and Ucklnt that true addiction might sometimes occur in smokers without neces* sarily any connection with the degree of smoking, P. 0. Wolff (Chief, Addiction-Producing Drug* Section, World Health Organisation) in 1951 expressed his belief tbat if tobacoo were In reality addiction-producing, each amoker would be, after a comparatively short time, the victim of his petty pleasure, and oould no longer be considered aa a simple user of tobacco but aa an addict with all tbe well-known consequences which this term implies. But, be stated, "there ara many amoker*, and even heavy smokers, who are able to deprive themselves at any moment of their pleasure, for tbe active substances of tobacoo do not enter into their cellular metabolism: at (east, no observations or proofi exist from which this can be established. If the chronic smoker experiences difficulty In breaking himself of the habit, If he manifests neuropathic symptoms, it Is his own Individuality which is tbe cause and not tbe substance.... Tobacco is a good example of tbe distinction between addiction and habit: we employ Intentionally tbe terra 'habit' in speaking of tobacco. Drugs liable to produce true addiction have the property of cresting addiotioa in all persons who take them long enough in sufficiently large doses...it Is Important to recognise these fundamental differences between addiction (morphine) and habit (tobacco), if the nature and meaning ol drug addiction are to be correctly understood." I, M. Johnston (1945a, bj 1947a) maintained the directly contrary view, that tobacco-smoking waa not a habit, but a drug addiction. "Clearly tbe essence of tobacco smoking is the tobacoo and not the smoking," he wrote, "Satisfaction oan be obtained from chewing it, from snuff taking, and from the administration of nicotine." Johnston drew tbe analogy of opium smoking, and asked whether thia also was a habit, and whether Intoxication with the alkaloid* ol opium were of secondary importance. Perhaps tbs truth lies, as It often does, in a via medio j not all users of tobacco are addicts in tbe classic meaning of the word, as Johnston would have it, nor, on the other hand, is every smoker immune to the development of a classic addiction to tobacco, aa Wolff categorically stated. Whether any particular smoker develop* a "habit" or an "addiction," or whether be might do so, may depend, In fact, upon the balance between hi* dependence upon nicotine as a drug and upon his dependence upon th* art of smoking as such; this question will be discussed below

Pullar-Strecker (1955,1956) preferred to classify drugs at (i) essentially malign, such a* narcotics; (2) potentially malign, such a* barbiturates and alcohol; and (31 essentially benign, such as tobacoo. He went on to point out that drugs could be compared according to vanoui different enter*, For instance, in termi of what people will pay to get their drug, narcotics come.fint, with tobacco a close second. In this con* nectlon, a report by Amitien (1948) on condition* in Oemiany dunng 1946-47, when tobaeco rations were reduced to about 40 cigarettes a month for men and 90 for aomta, n very pertinent. According to ArniUea, the majority of the habitual tmokert, up to a point, preferred to do without food even under extreme conditions of nutrition rather than to forego tobacco; thus, when food-rations in pruonerof-aar ramps were down to 900-1000 cslories, smokers were (till a tiling to barter their moderations for tobacco, and many house* ives who were imokers bartered fat and sugar for cigarettes, to disregard of consideration* of personal dignity, conventions! decorum, and eethetic-hygienie feelings, cigarette butts were picked out of the dirt by people who, on their own tatemeote, would in any other circumstances have felt disgust at such contact; smokers also condescended to beg for tobacco, but not for other things. In a group ot 105 people who were both chrome smokers and drinkers, 74 made journey*, bartered food and other possession*, or resorted to the black market to get tobacco; only 17 endeavored to get hold of alcohol in similar ways; 5 endeavored b these wsyt to get tobacco a* well as alcohol- Eighty per seat of those questioned by Armt-sen (1948) declared that it felt worse to do without alcottae than without aloohol- hilier-Stfeeker (1955) stated that tht hallmark of an addiction ia the suffering totalled when it is unobtainable, which is worse with narcotics and really quite bearable with tobacco. Other criteria instanced by Puller-Btrecker (1955, 1956) ares the difficulty of overoomlnjr, the addiction singlehanded, which is most with narcotics, and progressively less for barbiturate*, alcohol, and tobaeco; and

ol weeki for narcotics, months for barbiturates, years for alcohol, but never for tobacco. In social effect* (the extent to which it cuts across family life, work, duties, obligation*, reputation*, and so on), alcohol ii easily worst, according to Pullar-Strecker, followed by narcotic* and barbiturates; tobacco does not figure hers at all,

Smoking haa alto been termed a "disease" (e.g. by Oould, IS99; L. M. Johnston, 1945s. b, 1947a (who considered that any drug addiction waa a disease]; Tremeuen, 1945), but whether the word disease te used in it* common signification, in its etymological meaning, er metaphorically, li not always clear. Johnston (1957b) sutnmariied his loag'htld and frequently published belief as follows: smoking is a psychopathic affection; clearly, a toxic psychosis; baaed on tbe delusion that tobaeco is a luxury and a boon and not a toxic drag. Aa a disease, smoking u ipread by smokers! psychological infsetion of the non-emolfsr is completed se a rale by the intimate persuasion of a smoker. (Of this book, the lancet (/; 39, 1958) stated! "Wt wish him success (in hk campaign aajainst smokingl; but we must unhappily fore oast that the tone of hie book will incense meet smokers ratbtr than convince them of their errors."1 However, in the sense that eieessiv* smoking may admittedly result in dis-ease, the tern may be acceptable

In connection with such hereditary predisposition, a report by Heermenn (1941) I* interesting, Tbt writer described tbe esse of Identical twin*, in one of whom canoer of tbs vocal cords developed; and. since tbe one who developed cancer smoked, and the other did not, It was concluded tbat tobacco was the etiologic factor and, by inference, that a genetic predisposition was not present.

Any one penning the enormou* clinical literature on the association between tobaeootmoklni and lung cancer must inevitably be reminded of that celebrated community of Chinese which lived by taking in one another's washing. For tbe source-material of the very large number of papers on this fashionable but nevertheless Importiint subject comprises at most a few dosen original and basic investigations (mainly epidemiological; a fiw histopathologic*!) lexd the many hundreds of otbsr articles, essays, reviews, editorials, annotations, letters, etc., etc. are simply commentary. Borne of thl* commentary I* informed and judicious, valuable and necessary, of course; but tbe greater part of It, alas, U nothing more than a washing and rewsehing, until the very fabric of the original studies is threadbare, One b Inclined to tranilate Ovid's Meierim eupttebai epvt thus: Tbe workmanship |in Stephen Potter's sense!) surpassed the (source-] material.

We ere told, furthermore, that tbe number of lung-cancer victims ii legion, in pern if not in em; but wi must point out that the several dosen original investigations are based on. at most, a few thouaand oasee-a few thousand out of several hundreds of millions of amoker* in what Buss (1955) calls this "tmokiog world." Tbe point we are making here U, not whether these relatively few published lung-cancer victim* represent a fair sample ol the entire smoking population, but rather that it might perhaps be desirable for some of our washermen to hunt out and work up their own series of cases* and stop putting the ok) tired lung-cancer victims through tbe elothes-wrlnger-end tbe printing presses-time and again. Jtaauieecot %n peetJ

With these comment* on woord aad out of the way-thai there b a conspicuous scarcity of original source-material, whether measured as papers or patientswe may turn to wliat are called, and only too often miscalled, the "onginel pipers" But not before darkly quoting Gibbon {Destine m Feii ef Uu toman Empire, Ch. 31 )i

"It it amusing enough to delineate tbe form, and to trace the vegetation, of a lingular plant (and surely, In Medical Hilton-, thu tmokbg-lung cancer business is Just such a new growth*]; but the tedious detail of leaves without tlowert, and ot branches without fruit, would soon exhaust the patience and disappoint the curiosity of the laborious student."

It is, no doubt, supererogatory to explain that the sterile plant in this connection i* the epidemiological survey; the ferule one, that which yield* biological relationships a* flower and fruit

Luno-Canetr Mortality Relet and Per-CepUe Tebacco Contumptm

A relationship between death-rates from lung cancer and tobacco consumption may be apparent In Km* (tune-trend studies), or else tn epeee, that t* to say, from country to ooun-trj, on the basis of the proposition that national differences in imoktng habit* and/or death-rate* from this disease may point out the presence or absence ot a relation*hip betwrf n these to dependent or independent variable*.

Perhaps the least satisfactory way of determining such long-term effect* of smoking haa been the study of time-trend eesocbtioas (Hammond, 1958b); and we would be derelict in our duty as monographers should we fail to point out to the perhaps innocent reader that the following- long and mnuyonl sections on euch Time-Trends have absolutely no relevance or validity so far as the qusstion ef lung cancer and tobacco-smoking b concerned. Aocording to data from the Bureau of the Census, National Office of Vital Statistics, a tremendous increase haa occurred In the reported death-rat* from lung oanoer in tbs United 8tet*s, the aft4tondardised rate for white males riling from about 0.7 per 100,000 in 1914 to 98 4 per 100.000 inl9M (see Hammond, 1958b, Fig 1). Thu led to the hypothec* that a corresponding Increase must have occurred In one or more factor* responsible for lung cancer, probably some substance inhaled into tht lungs Exposure to certain Inhalants, such as fumes from fuel oil, fumes from motor vehicles, dust from asphalt road surfaces, a* well a* cigarette consumption, has risen during the same period of time (Hammond, 1954c; Hammond, 1058b, Fig. 2); and, since these inhalant* or derivative* from them oan w used to produce oanoer experimentally, reason b therefore assumed for postulating that one or more of them, or a combination of all of them, b at least partially responsible for the rue In lung-canoer mortality, Ochsner and peBeiey (l.Wla) preeeoted a graph showing a comparison of the death-ret* per 1000 of population from eancer of the lung with th* production of tobaeco and of automobiles b tbe United Bute* during 1990-1986 inclusive. Whereas there was said to be no iltnlficsat relation between the production of automobiles and lung eancer, there was stated to be so obvious persJbbsm between tbe Increased production of tobacco and earclnoma of the lung. On the other band, Dontenwill (1955) held that a much stronger Increase (concomitant with the increased incidence of lung eancer) than that In tobacco consumption and industrialisation b shown by the number of automobiles from 1914 to 1954, although this does not permit the conclusion that automobile exhaust-gas b a cause of tbe increase in bronchial carcinoma. Hueper (1955) also pointed out that tbe nte in lung cancers follows more closely tbe increase in consumption of motor fuel and the construction of asphalted highways than the consumption of cigarettes, and ts similar to the increase n the production ef other oinceNrelated chemicals.

Meet responsible authorities have agreed that no absolutely valid conclusion esn be drawn from the simultaneous rise ol the lung-eeocer mortality-rate and any such "environmental factor" curves; indeed, it b possible to show slralUr more or less parallel time-trend curve* for Increased tobacco consumption and increase in the number of electric refngerator* and other presumably non-eawlnegenie factors. More to the point, the same curve could probably be also obtained by plotting the increase in diagnostic methods, for example, bronchography, etc. (Dontenwill, 1955).

According toTt. Hoffman's (1W) statistics, cancer of the lungs tocreased from 0.7 per 100,000 canoer death* In 1915 to 1.9 in 1927. While some oheervers Icf. r^tenwIU (1955)) considered thb due to better diagnosis, Hoffman felt it.was directly connected with the spmd of }b* elgam<* habit, in-eluding Inhalation of stnobe. Iassey (958s, b) stated that the number of reported deaths from lung cancer has been mounting rapidly elnee tbe earbr Twenties of tht*jjenury, and the ha* been a eormpotwiiug ^eree* to the * tion of cigarettes a* will a* an taj**^,!^ J** to diagnose the disease, Deaux aaOeW (1955) found a sig-luficant correlation co-efficlcnt to exist between tbe to van-

sbles Of per-capita tobacco consumption and rate of death from broncho-pulmonary cancer. On the other hand, Burton (1956) wrote; "Veer by year the curve of incidence of lung etnest has been drawing away from the curve or tobacco consumption, and we should do well to look for some other possible factor which has been inewssing." T. W. foe* (1959) noted that the increase in Incidence of lung cancer ts not paralleled by changes io smoking habit*.

Wyndsr (1956) Bated as one of the reasons for regarding tobacco smoking as of causal significance in lung cancer the fact that lung cancer has bcreased sharply throughout those countries where there ha* been a great increase In tobacco consumption, particularly in the form of cigarettes, However, tbe mott one can say of tuch a relationship b that it b not inconsonant with lucb a conclusion. The mere correlation b time between increase of tobacco use and cancer of the lung is no logical basis for etiology of one against the other (Bbyah, 1953). A more detailed statement of the ease is given by Hueper (1955, 1057a). A real, definite, and progressive increase b the frequency of lung cancer itarted b most industrialised countries around ths turn of the century, that b, at a time when cigarette-smoking was still a habit of minor significance (Hueper, 1955), This rise was first clearly recognised by pathologists of Central Europe daring the early I990'e through a study of necropsy data collected during the frit two decades of the 90th century and was subsequently confirmed and eUborated upon by biostatittical bmtigations from America and Europe which mainly used cancer-mortality data. The annual age-ad|usted increase b frequency of lung-cancer deaths was higher In 1914-1980 than b 1931*1944, whereat the markedly Increased cigarette contumption during previous year* should have boosted the annual progression rate stove that seen during tbe earlier period. It has been tug-tested iUclunt(l958);Hammcnd (1954)1 that thl* paradoxical behavior of progression rates is attributable to the fact that many cigarette-smokers did not live long enough to develop a lung eancer because of their precocious death from coronary sclerosis, which also b assumed to be elicited b the majority ol cases by eigarette-emokbg, according to statistical evidence. Such en explanation conveniently dispose* of an observation challenging tbe validity of the cigarette theory, and may perhaps momentarily satisfy the protagonist* of thb concept, although it cannot be taken seriously by any one who has any competence to the study ot arteriosclerosis (Hueper, 1955). Again, no consistent relation exists between the consumption of tobacco and cigarettes b different countries and during venous periods, and their respective lung-concer rates (Hueper, 1967*).

Nielsen and Clemmesen (1955) presented figure* ihowbg annual per-capita consumption of tobacco aad of cigarettes for inhabitant* of Norway, Sweden, Canada, Denmark, SwitterUad, Netherlands, Finland, and England-Wales in 1930 and 1950-1953. Hueper (1955, Pig. 5) showed annual tobacco consumption in pounds per capita In Great Britain, Norway, SwitaerUnd, Turkey, and th* United States, in tbe years 1900-1950. The former author* bterpreted their data a* showing tome *Ught correlation with crude mortality figure* for cancer of tb* lung b the case ot total tobacco coo* sumption, but a definite correlation in the case of cigarette consumption; .while the Utter author oould not find any paralklkm between the annual per-capita consumptioa of tobacco in the different countrte* and their respective pul" rootary-cancer death-rates.

Hueper (1955,1957a) drew attention to the fact that tbe rite in lung-cancer rates started before clgarette<amokbg

eaiumed Urge proportions. The rise b th* occurrence of lung eanoer came at the turn ot tbe century, whereas the first pronounced Increase m cigarette consumption occurred imme-

Sft?* i?'r.5<>!%5i,r(UM>?fwo' ** Mflwh. med. Wschr. 97/ 551, 1955). Ltckbt (1955) took exception to the statement that b Central Europe the bore*** of pulmonary carcinoma was already prevalent about the turn of the century, whereas the habit of cigarette-smoking became only popular after the first world war (se* reference above). This writer objected that the names of these Central European countries are not given; he himself felt that only Russia experienced an early increase b lung-cancer aortauty, and this wa* related to the fact that her cigarette industry bad been in being b the middle of the past century. The next pUce where lung-cancer mortality bcreaeed was said to be in Dresden, where a cigarette factory was started in 1862

Several writers have maintained that, since tobaeco-imoke a* a pulmonary carcinogen presumably has a required et-poture-time of 90 years, comparison should not be mad* between contemporaneous iung-eaacer mortality-rates and per-capita tobaeco or cigarette consumption, thp, ahen the annual consumption ol cigarette* by the Inhabitant* of several countries about 1980 was plotted hy Nielsen and Cleumesee (1954) against crude mortality figures for cancer of tht hing about 80 years Uter, It teemed clear to then that countries with a high consumption of cigarette* were almost certain to show a coriwpondbgly Ugh mortality from eancer of the lung

seemed to exbt between tbe total consumption of tobacco per individual about 1980 and the crude mortality figure* for cancer of the htng b 1950, thb was said to be lee* ttriklog than ought have been expected,) Diagram* reUtiag the lung-cancer mortality of these tame countries in about 1950 to tobacco consumption aad cigarette consumption of the tarns oouatnet in about 1030 were bterpreted as showing no correUtioo b tbt case of total tobacco consumption, but a

(Clemmesen and Nleben, 1954). Llcktot (1955) also made the point that comparison of present-day lung-cancer mortality-rate* with present-day cigarette consumption was inadmissible, sine* the people who now die of lung cancer are those who had begun to smoke 90,80, or 40 year* ago, Therefore, taking thb Ug period bto consideration, comparison should be made between prcoeovday mortality rates from lung cancer and per-capita cigarette consumptioa 20 or more years ago; and, while Hueper (1955) found no paralieUsm between the annual per-capita consumption of tobacco b different countries end their mpwtiw pulmonary-center death rates, 1900-1950, bickbt (1955) was able to relate per-capita cigarette consumption in various countries b 1990 with their respective eancer mortalities b IMS. Doll (reported b Lancet. Load. /; 611-519,1967) alto stated that the mortality-rate from lung cancer had risen with the consumption of cigarettes, but about 80 year* later. Daly (1959) also thought ft possibls that an index of present smoking habit* b inadequate, and that a measure of smoking habits of 80 year* agols more relevant

people b the U. 8. A., aho smoke about 80% more cigarette* than those of England and Wales, show a death-rat* from lung caneer (in 1950) lee* tbaa half that of the rate for the latter. Doll and Hill (1954M made reply to thl* queatioai and Doll (reported b Lancet, Lend, tt 511-519,1957) stated that there was in general a good eomUtion between the death-rate from lung cancer and the cigarette consumption in different countries, but agreed that the death-rate was higher In Britain and lower in the United States than would be expected from comparison with other countries. The figure* cited by Rut* (1954) were also quoted by Hueper (1955,1957a), who wsnt on to say: "Thb Interesting and perhaps significant observation, which fstb to support validity of the cigarette theory, b dupoied of by its proponents by assuming that exposure to cigarette tar b Us* severe for Americans who do not smoke cigarette* to the very end than (or English srooksrs, who, for economic reasons, Indulge b thb questionable habit."

Llckbt (1956) took issue with the statement in Munches Medicinuche Wochenschrift (Mr 551, 1955) that there are let* cigarettes smoked in England and Wales than b tht l*nlt*d Btatee, but that the deathxttat from lung cancer b England and Wales are about 9.6 timet those in tbe V. 8. Lickbt maintained (as noted b the preceding section) that comparison of prtteot-day figures on cancer of the lung mortality with present-day figures of cigarette consumption was Inadmissible, because tbe people who now die of cancer of the lung are the portion of those smoksra who had already begun to smoke 90-40 year* ago. tt is true that the number of cigarettes smoked b tbe U, 8. is considerably higher than In England, but thb was just the opposite b tbe year* so decisive for celcuUtlona of present-day lung-cancer mortality. I.e. the years before World War II and even earuer. According to Licldnt's figures, the per-capita cigarette consumption in tht U. 8. A. for tbe years 1949,1939, t930. and 1997, were, respectively, 3188,1760,864, aad 600; whereas tn England, the per-capita cigarette consumption for the same years was, respectively, 9099,1955,1900, and 1000 (assumed figure), He stated, there was a great probability that after 90,30, or more years, tbe situation will be rev*reeds more Americans than Englishmen will suffer from lung eancer.

According to Keutser (1957), data for 1953 show that twice as much tobacco was consumed b the U. 8. A. as compared to EngUnd, yet the incidence of lung cancer b EngUnd was twice a* great as in the U. 8 A. To try and explab this db crcpancy away by assuming different smoking habits seemed ubturd to this author. In 1955, the lung-cancer death-rate b England and Wales for male* was 9.1 times as high aa that reported in the U. 8. A., and for female* 1,9 tunes higher (Hammond, 1058a). This difference for males haa exbted for kovertl decades, while, prior to 1949, there was only a small difference to the female rates. The female rate* continued to increase after 1948 in EngUnd and Wales, but not in the I'. S, A. The Urge difference* between the lung-cancer death-rate in EngUnd and Wales and b tbe IT. S.Tiave not been satisfactorily cxpUincd, Cigarette-smoking apparently became popular at an earlier date b the United Kingdom than in the U. 8 s for example, in 1935, tbe average per-annum consumption per adult in the United Kingdom was 1589 cigarette*; in the U. 8., 1410. In 1956, tbe figure* were 9509 and 3195, respectively. Among both males and females b the middle- audN old-age groups, there are proportionately more cigarette-smokers id the U. K, than b tbe U, 8., although the number of cigarette* consumed per smoker per. day b higher b the U. 8. than ta the U. K. The proportion ot mate ugsrette-tmokert who inhale v about the same in both coun-

tries, Hammond too noted that some observers are under the impression that American smoker* often discard a cigarette after taking only a few puff* while thb seldom happens in the United Kingdom. If true, he felt thb might make a difference b tht degree to which smokers in the two countries are exposed to tobacco-smoke} but data at present avertable do not support the hypothesis that a substaotbl proportion of the difference b lung-cancer rates between th* two countries is attributable to difference* tn the use of cigarette*. Hammond stated that while it b possible that some of the difference may be due to factors associated with urbanisation for example, air pollution or occupational exposureavailable evidence doe* not suggest that these factor* caa account for a Urge part of the difference. Climate cannot be ignored; there b a higher incidence ol bronchitis b the British Isles than b tht v. 8. While tt seems iinliktly that bronchitb alone can result b lung cancer, It b not unreesoneblt to postuUte that bronchitis bcreases the susceptibility of an individual to the carcinogenic effect of some other factor, such as ciga-rettiMttoke or air pollutants. He also pointed out th* potit-bllity that differences b the dbgnosb and recording of cause* of death may account for a part of the dlffeitaee between reported lung-cancer death-rate* b tbe United Kingdom end the United States.

Eire

The average total bcldenoeof rung cancer b male* b rural England was calculated by Paxtoa (1955) to bt 8 times tbat of rural Eire, and th* mortality rates for Dublb County Borough and Dublin County were about hall tht Tynetide (England) figure, However, cigarette consumption for the years 1939 and 1949 b Eire and in the United Kingdom were comparable.

Epidemiological ttudbs by Eastcott (1955) [cited by Hueper (1955)] b New Zealand have provided important data concerning the Uck of parallelism between the annual percept* consumption of tobacoo and tbt pulmonary-cancer death-rate. It was found that the relative consumption of tobacco b pound* par head per annum for th* population of New Zealand and the United Kingdom revealed an inverse rcUtioa to their lung-cancer death-rates. Furthermore, unroi-grants to Ntw Zealand from the United Kingdom were found to have a higher Incidence of lung cancer than New Zealand-bom persons of th* same stock (Eesteott, 1955,1956); and, b tht author's opinion, difference* b habits of tobacco-smoking are unlikely to contribute to thb picture. Tbt observation that tmlgrenti from Greet Britain have a 40% higher death-rate from lung oancer than native-born New Zealanders, In spite of tbe faot tbat the Utter smok* mar* heavily than do the British, may warrant a survey of lung cancer in New gt*UndaA.M.A.lW;7,l958).

H. Joule* (Unset, tend. It 163.1956) strongly criticised Eattcott for not having Warned the bereeeed incidence of lung cancer b Ntw Zealand on cUsretU-emoking, J. Torrance (Lancet, Lend, /, 986,1956) took Joules to task for Insisting that smoking wa* the only factor involved b lung carcinogen*. b,

SMOKING * HEALTH

REPORT OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE

TO THE SURGEON GENERAL

OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICE

U.S DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH, EDUCATION, AND WELFARE Public Health Service

to deal with the materia) from both  general viewpoint ind on tlie basis of disease categories.

As may be seen In a glance at the Table of Contents of this Report, the main topical divisions of the study were*.

  Tobacco and tobacco smoke, chemical and physical characteristic* (Chapter 6).

  Nicotine, pharmacology ahd toxicology (Chapter 7).

  Mortality, general and specific, according to age, sex, disease, and amok-kg habits, and other factor* (Chapter 8).

  Cancer of the lungs and other organs; carcinogenesis; pathology, and epidemiology (Chapter 91.

t Nonneoplastic diseases of Ihe respiratory trad, particularly chronic bronchitis and emphysema, with some consideration of the effect* of air pollution (Chapter 10).

  Cardiovascular disease*, particularly coronary artery disease* (Chapter

  Other condition*, a mlicellany Including gattric and duodenal ulcer, perinatal disorders, tobacco amblyopia, accident! (Chapter 12).

  Characterisation of the lobacco habit and beneficial effects of tobacco (Chapter 13).

  Psycho-tocial aspects of smoking (Chapter 14).

  Morphological constitution of smokers (Chapter IS).

A* the primary duty of the Committee was to asses* information about smoking and health, a major general requirement wa* that of making tbe information available. That requirement was met in three ways. The first and most Important was the bibliographic service provided by the National Library of Medicine. As the annotated monograph by Larson.

In compliance with thli request, the National Library of Medicine furnithed the Committee bibliographies containing approximately 1100 titles, Fortunately, the Committee staff was housed In the National Library of Medicine on the grounds of the National Institutes of Health, and through this location had ready access to books and periodicals, it well as to scientists working in Us field of Interests. Modern apparatus (or photo-reproduction of articles wa* used constantly to provide copies needed for study by members of the Committee, In addition, the member* drew upon the libraries and bibliographic service* of tho** Institutions in which they held academic positions. A considerable volume of copies of report* and a number of special articles were received from a variety of additional source*.

All of Ihe major companies manufacturing cigarette* and other tobacoo products were invited to submit statement* and any Information pertinent lo the inquiry. The replies which were received were taken into consideration by the Committee.

promoting cessation. Surnnraraed below are some of tbe research findings, program and experimental approaches, and needs cn the areas of smoking education and prevention discussed in this part of the report.

2. Most educations] programs are baaed on what seems reasonable rather than on sound theoretical models. It is logical to assume, for exxmp&c, that young people who know about the harmful effects, of cigarette smoking on health will resist smoking. Thus, man; prqg,ra*it* arc based on knowledge dissemination and a health threat. However, we know that 9* percent of teenagers say that smoking is harmful to health and 90 percent of teenage smokers are aware of the health threat.

2.  The trend in adult education programs is toward *mjiiui.. on personal responsibility for individual health and adoption of a heattb-protwrting Hfestyte.

3.  Researchers find that "srguificaat adnha"jjhj&iuaia. norses, dentists, other health pftfemiotialsvCTaKte^andiarentea poweiv ftrf influences on teenage snokhrg. A aa&mwidenzrweyof teenageo. for example, indicated that 72, percent f the noosmofcers identified physicians aa tbe one group that could mftoence them not to start smoking; 43 percent of the smokers felf that the physician's safviee would influence theardecnon to atop ssaoiaatx.

4. Health professionals as a group hae preceded the general ptc in improving- their smoking habits; they have stepped smoks^nraved to leas hazardous forms of tobacco, or reduced the amount smoked.

& Several staxfies of methodologies used in smoking education rested mixed results; with bo method dearly predominating.

lowering tar and nicotine in cigarette smoke (i), aad major efforts undertaken in the research sector to develop and evaluate a less hazardous cigarette (i)r the interactions between the physr-eal/ehemcal characteristics of the cigarette aad the behavior-al/pfcysiologkal characteristics of the snooker are being: given increasing attention.

As discussed elsewhere in this report, there are many theories about why people smoke. While in most eases the explanation is not simple, nicotine is, a generally agreed-upon factor. Nicotine has Joog heec considered as habitual at least and, by some persons, as an addictive drag {SS, S7t Si% The Third Report of tbe Royal CoBege of Physicians of London (ISTTi  quite exptidt in stating that "Tobacco smoking- is a form of drug dependence different from but no Jess strong than that is other drags of addiction'' {50a.y The pharmacodynao^ implications o! smoking have generated detoxification tecteaqttes itt smoking-oessa-tkm programs, tbe search f or nicotine sabstitntes or antimcotine drugs fagm kbeliae {tCfi. the presentation of nicotine in an alternate vehicle (cgm chewing gam (52)). and the evahsatxn of nicotine aerosol techniques ia terms of their impact on modifying smoking behavka

Bwcscw of the role of nicotine in creating- a dependency for tht smoker, it ia appropriate to consider smoking; patterns aad tbe effecti these pattellas have on response to pgnrette smoke components. Then are many ways to characterise smoking patterns;

7>pe<^cxps?Ttftrsaiofc*. Cigarette brands vary radically today ii terms of nicotine and tar delivery and sosnewbat less ra terms of CO acrolein, HGN aad NOx's.

Jvaatorr* ojctfforwttts siuoksbL Lbtxt ranges from none to a maxinma of about 100 cigarettes a day.

Ammtat ofctgotetfe tntokteL Smoking' patterns raagc front smolonf only the first few mDSmeters to smoking down to a few saHkaeten from tbe butt end. Inasmuch as the tobacco at the bratt end of tht cigarette acts asa filter and buOds ap mcotiae and tar as the tigarett* b smoked, the fast few puffs on a cigarette smoked aD the way dowi wifi have a much higher nicotine aad tar delivery than the first-puffs

IfmWBtrercfpmffk. TIuscbr raqge from one or two puffs up to abosr 20.

Depth of innalottoa. Again, this can vary from the pattern of tht nonahafer to deep inhalation.

Length cf irthatatim. The longer the cigarette smoke is bekiin th* lungs, the greater the absorption and thus, the deposition of smoke

Since it would be pnwiHft for an iiximdaalsniolri^ day to absorb more of the components of cigarette smoke than one wot smoked many times that number, realistic evaluation of smoidnf impact calls for the development of dosimetric techniques applicable t* teseari^screeg&^aadsanohteg-prtternmob^Scationpgt^ams.

EnaauauiMoapcal System

Although there has been much recent research cn endocrine effects of smoking, tbe role these play hi the smoking habit has scarcely been examined. "With the development of more refined and more economical techniques for measuring hormones and their actions, we caa expect aa acceleration of research in tins area.

Hayward and Psvasatirpaisit (tS) adssmstered IV nkotine to monkeys, causing an increase of argrahx vasopressin (AVP) without changes ia plasma osmolality. Hosain. et aL (55) aad Robinson {109} also demonstrated the release of AVP plus nenropbystns  humans.

Cryer, et aL (SS) demonstrated that growth hormones and Cortisol arc released by smoking and are unaffected by /^-blockers. Both arc involved m protein and carbohydrate metabolism. Perhaps their effect on plasma gfooose helps reinforce the smoking habit. Similar results were found by others (/OO, HI. US).

Perhaps a factor involved ia maintenance of smoking is the increased KpoJysis due to release of catecholamines aad ghicocorto-ootds. A common reason gl*tm for retnnMng to smoking-is weight gain

Other endocrinological effects of montane include increased gastric SCI secretion (24, 89). decreased paoereata; bicarbonate* and water secretion secondary to inJnfcition of secretin (ii, . i3, 5), <&aages in placenta) honnoaea <2T. 12S\ alteratioa in prostaglandin formation \lmm% and delayed LH surge in female rats {SS% Atao, it is known that in smokers there is decreased sperm quality aad <fis4ributn {121% Smokes aad nonsmokers do aot seem to vary ia LH, TSH, T4 and FSB {1*9% however.

Cusaaffoti off tha Smoking Habit

Early Effects of Cessation

Cessation of smoking ia awrjatprf with alterations in CNS, cartSovas-cular. aad other physiological functions. Whether these are true "withdrawal" phenomena characterised by a rebound or merely a return to normal levels still remans to be determined. It is evident, however, that significant changes do occur.

A number of physiological changes have been observed on withdraw* a] from tobacoo. Decreases ia heart rate- and diastolic Mood pressure are observed as early as 6 hours after withdrawal {91% These changes persist for at least 3 days <?XX {1&0 susd perhaps for 30 {S7% Decreased excretion of both adrena&ae and norepinephrine {$) and various metabolic changes have also been observed {S7%

IS20

These metabolic and peripheral effects, which are often associated with decreased arousal, have been supported by EEG studies showing-increases in low-frequency activity (/S5) and alterations in cortical alpha frequencies (Tsj. Utetiand ltH{lSS)recorded cortical EEG from besvy smokers (one pack of dgarettes per day} in aa attempt to detect EEG changes amwruitod with acute withdrawal. Basefiae EEG measurements were obtained while the smokers engaged in thear rtormal snaokiiaj pattern and were compared rith data from tbe same individuals after they were deprived of tolntrco for 2* hours. It was found that there was a significant increase In the low-frequency EEG bands (3-5-7 cycles/sec) during deprivation. litis effect was readily reversed after the subjects smoked two cigarettes within a 5-mJnote period.

In a similar study, Knott and Venabfcs (72) did a computer analysis

of cortical alpha activity in male nonsmokers, smokers asked to abstain

for a 23- to 25-bour period, and smokers who continued their normal

pattern of smoking-. Analysis of variance of pre-satoki&g alpha activity

Indicated the mean alpha frequency of the subjects in the deprived

group was significantly lower (9-3 He} than in the nonsmoking group

*              (20 Hz) aad aoadeprived group (% Hz). When tbe deprived group

smoked two dgarettes, the alpha frequency increased to the levels of

the nonsmoker aad smoker control groups. Thus, there is evidence for s

rebound effect  and a true  withdrawal  reaction.  The data toe

interpreted as indicating' that deprived smokers are ia a state of

cortical "hypo-excitatioo,'* aad that smoking: las the effect of

increasing excitability to levels comparable to those found is aon-

I              smoking aad aoadeprived groups. Since aS groups were equal on

'              measures of extroversion, the authors hypothesize that they have

{              described a true "smoking factor1* rather than a difference due to

personality. Alternatively, one oould condode from the same data that

the results obtained are due to the removal of an arousal-producing

drug from a group of people who are ordinarily hypo-aroused.

Numerous other physiological changes have been noted to occur

after cessation of smoking. Ejrup {27) reports that weight gain is a

common sequela to cessation. Although not generally observed, he

r              reported that, a number of patients, busters in the mouth occurred

along with constipation upon cessation of smoking. If the patients

{              resumed smoking-, the blisters disappeared.

j               - Krumhoh. et aL (74) have measured changes m cardiopulmonary

'              function at rest and during exercise 3 and 6 weeks after cessation of

[              smoking*. All subjects had smoked more than oac pack of cigarettes s

1              day for at least Syears, Changes during exercise were measured oa the

1              standard bkydc emuracter test. Following 3 weeks of abstinence,

In spite of a decrease in adoH. smoking since the dfaaemiaatSop of the . 1964 VS. Suigeoa GeneraTs Report on Smoking aad Health, there s dXscouragfng evideace that aiuokiog among teenage boys a* remauxi ng virtually constant and among teenage girls it is actually increasing. It is apparent tbat more knowledge is aeeded concerning the way io ' winch tbe psychosocial factors that may contribute to the initiation of smoking can be applied to the development of effective strategies to deter the onset of smoking.

It is possible that prevention programs directed at children and adolescents have generally placed too much confidence ia merely commsnicatBQg knowledge stbout the dangers of smoking. Developers of these programs may assume that such fear arousal will ia itself be sufficient to thwart smoking. In fjact, as will be ampEfied later in this chapter, by the time children reach jumor high school, almost all of them be&eve smoking is dangerous. It appears that eommmncatioBs concerning the dangers of smoking whether delivered from schools, churches, voluntary agencies, mass media, the family, peers, governmental agencies, industrial orgatsza&oos, consumer orgastzatioBS, or tabor aniens (individually or collectively) have, indeed, been effective ia persuading- dtOdrca asd adolescents that T"*ftyg is dangerous. However, it ia abo evident that fear of the consequences of *"w*"g may in itself not be sufficient to discourage a substantial number of chUdren from beginning to smoke -when they approach adolescence

Some investigators in this field have contended that at aa earlier level of the child's development, perhaps between the ages of 4 to 9 or 10, tbs child takes quite literally the dangers of smoking. In fact, it is often observed at tins level of development that children may be especially worried if they observe a parent or older sibling smoking. They wiB admonish them to atop smoking because it "cap cause caaeer or a heart attack.*' Tet as they approach adolescence, many of these same children wiD begin smoking.

Responses from the teenagers themselves suggest that peer pressure to smoke may be one of tbe major influences. There is also some evideace that the smoking parent becomes a model for the eh3<L If 'both parents smoke there is a greater Skehaood that the child wiS begin smoking than if only one parent smokes or if neither parent smokes. Kit evea tf oae parent smokes, this may influence the child to smoke more than if neither parent smokes. Interestingly, if aa older sibling and both parents smoke the chSd is about four times more Hkely to smoke than if there were no smokers in tbe family.

Tbe influence of tbe mass media in the initiation of w"Jg is somewhat more difficult to establish. Smokers are depicted in films and television, as well as in cigarette advertising which tends to pot tray them in interesting and exciting- environments, suggesting that attractive, desirable people tend to smoke. Has would logically be

2A, classified themselves as regular smokers by age. 15 in 1966 than did the respondents of the ataae age group in 1955.

Ia the national surveys between 3965 and 1974 {SI} the ienvtfonshq> between various factors related to socioeconomic status aad ssBoidag were examined. For example, teenagers who mtb employed outside the heme are twice as Slody to smoke as teenagers who are not employed. Also, educational aad vocational aspirations are related to smoking. Students who plan to go to college are the least likely to smoke. A study coaduc&ed by Borland aad Rudolph (9) determined that sodoeeuootuic status bears some relationship to smoking in high school students fdukfren in lower socioeconomic levels are more Hkdy to smoke), hot socioeconomic status correlates less with smokiug than parental smoking or poor scholastic performance {although all three variables are themselves correlated}.

The fitarature fails to address adequately the initiatioa off pre-adult smoking. Rather, the emphasis is on "regular"' smokers, jfeverthekas. inferences from such data may be helpful in. suggesting factors that are related to the initiation of smoking.

As would be expected, beliefs of teenagers about smoking are related to whether or aot they smoke. Ot course, smokeis generally hold more favorable attitudes toward smoking than do aommekeia {$, 75). Nevertheless, data (5g) suggest that even teenage anjukeis seldom consider the decision to smoke a wise deoasoci. Pur example, 77 percent cfsmokenbelievethatitigbetteriK&toslartsmakiagthantohsveto quit Over half of tbe teenage smokers beBeve that dgarette smoking becomes harmful after just 1 year of smoldng. Eighty-four pa cent say it is habit fomuag; whfie 8 pereeat agree tbat it is a bad habit Of aH teenagers, TS per cent beBeve that dgarette smoking* caa cause lung cancer aad heart disease. Eighty-seven percent of *I teenagers and 77 percent of teenage smokers beBeve that smoking caa harm their health. Tbe vast majority of teenagers cousidei -^nnkitt^ as habit forming, but almost two-thirds do aot feel that hrenrning addicted to smoking is as Tnuninent threat to then* health. ^p**'*"i*^'T*'l wmarw-g is considered safe.

Ftshbem (W) cites evidence from a study conducted for the American Cancer Society ia 2S75 which suggests that teenage smoking Bpereemsd by teenagers as more prevalent than it actually is. Eighty-three percent of tile teeua^eia in this survey tend to think of other te^JMgtis as being aaaukeis rather than nopamokers.

Finally, it shook! be pointed out that knowledge or beSefs about tbe

{10. Attitudes may be much more Comdex than simple beBefs about the hmTmftmt effects of smoking; Various factors influencing the complexity of attitudes toward smoking are di.wu.wed in the most recent report of the four aatioaal surveys mentioned earSer (0. These factors include the adverse effects of smoking on the rndtvkfaaTs

health aad on the environment (pollution), the psychological and sociological benefits of smoking (eg^ "makes you feel good"), rationafiz&tkms that allow smoking, perceptions of reasons for smoking and for smoking initiation, the negative stereotypes coacern-iag smokers, attitudes toward authority, and control ever one's destiny.

In essence, when considering both current smoking patterns and beliefs among ch3dren and adolescents, the factors related to smoking can be categorized m terms of perceived psychosocial benefits versus actual threats to health. Considering thfct dichotomy, tbe suggestion of the VJS, Public Health Service <<M> should not he ignoredr

It is futile to continue to tell teenagers that smoking ts harmful and that they abotddat do it They kaow that it is harmful. Moat do not -want to do it. The moat effeetive thing that we caa do is to help them to understand tbe benefits of smoking as compared with the costs and dangers so that they w3l have the facts that they need in order to make a thoughtful decision as to whether to smoke or sot to smoke (p, 27).

netevnt Conceptual Models to Developmental and Social Paycfaotogv

chSdrea aad adolescents b a complex endeavor demanding the utxhzataoa of diverse conceptualisations. This secticm wffi consider four representative coweptosl models in developmental and social psychology that would appear to be potentially useful ia generating hype4besestoa<ecmtfcs-theamtiationo

aad in providing conceptual bases for pteveutian programs,,These conceptuaHzatioss are Fiagetfs Cognitive Development Theory,, Eeik-soa's Theory of Psjthosodal Development. Baaidura's Social learning Ttecry said itcGnire's Persuasive Communication Model.

Tbe Cognitive Developmental Theory of FSaget (26, ). oae of the most influential cognitive theories, b concerned with the nature aad origin of knowledge. PSaget's view of the development of knowledge would appear to offer some applications to understanding tbe informational and decisional aspects of the initiation of smoking ia the developing cfrikl

Piaget views knowledge as developing out of the iwfividuatt adaptive interaction with the environment through the processes of assimilation (incorporatioo of concepts into existing cognitive strue tores) aad acoomraodstioa (modification of cognitive structures) There are fear major stages of intellectual development: (1) sensory motor period (birth to 2 years), involving simple perceptual and motes adjustments to immediate environmental phenomena; <2) prajpeta tional period <2 to 7 years), involving a precooceptual phase {the

Conclusions that mcotine exposure produced physical dependence wen also oomiBtwnt with early data which suggested that Lv. nicotine delivery seemed to relieve withdrawal from cigarettes and may have produced physical dependence to. a aonamofeer (Johnston 19423. Other supporting observations included tbe finding that abrupt reduction of the nicotine in cigarettes Q&, low nicotine-yield cigarettes) resulted ia behavioral aad physiological withdrawal signs including discomfort and tfaeamking of regular cigarettes (Fmnfgan, Larson. Haag 1945; Knapp, Bliss, Walls 1963). However, the rigorous scientific methods of the load that were developed to evaluate withdrawal from opioids aad sedatives (HJaangfohach 1942; Isbell 1948; XsbeH et aL 19% Chapter V> were not applied to the study of the tobacco withdrawal syndrome until tbe late 2970$. Therefore, the data anailabie at the time of the 1964 Report of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking aad Health were not

characteristics of phgRucal dependence on nicotine, including the relationship of mcotine intake to the magnitude of withdrawal signs and symptoms, and the rrfe of both environmental and pharmacologic (actors which influence the course of the withdrawal syndrome.

Criteria for Physical Dependence on Nicotine mad C&aieal Characteristics of the Withdrawal Syndrome

JSriflw kiads of phenomena characterize withdrawal syndromes from aS drugs that produce ghyaical dependence. If physical dependence oo akutiuo occurs* these same phenomena should be oUer*ed (see Chapter V: Martin 2977; Thompson aad tJnaa 1977; Woods, Kant, Winger 1967). Baaed on these phenomena, criteria for

following: (13 Tterrmnwiiriri of ugaiette smoking shooM be accompanied by changes in mood, behavior, aad physical functioning. QD Some of these <3sages should ba ia a (fraction which is opposite to those produced by cigarette smoking and should return to tbe baseline levels observed during chronic tobacco administration ("rebound effects*!. (3) Physiological withdrawal effects should be reversible- by nicotine adnunistzutiou.

Tne tobacco withdrawal syndrome as described by the APA in the revised Diagnostic and Statistical Manual CDSM IH-RJ (APA 1987X provides a fliniral description CXable 5J. Several of the symptoms of the nicotine withdrawal syndrome correspond to effects of uncofine that are either known or suspected to promote tobacco dependence as discussed ia Chapter VI. lie should be noted that the sequelae of

the same underlying mechanisms. For example, some symptoms are

198

transient responses which are opposite those produced when nicotine is given and which subside within a few days or weeks of nicotine abstinence; auch responses are presumed to reflect a physiological rebound occurring in the absence of chronic drug exposure. Other responses are afao opposite those produced by nicotine administration but appear to primarily reflect the reinowal of aad which may occur whether or not sufficient nicotine had been taken to produce physical dependence. An example of tbe latter type of response is body weight. Nicotine can directly suppress appetite aad body weight, often below tbe value at which it would have been had nicotine not been taken; removal of nicotine is then accompanied by a stable increase in body weight-

Various lines of scientific evidence are available to characterize physical dependence on tobacco aad to evaluate the specific role of nicotine. These data include surveys, treatment studies, md experimental laboratory studies aad are briefly reviewed ia this. Section.

Retrospective Survey Data

Retrospective studies have been conducted with ex-smokers who were participating in major surveys (Wynder. Kaufman, Leaser 19*77; Hughes. Gust, Pechacek 1967) or who were patients with chronic respiratory problems (Burns 1969; M&osaer 1970). Other studies were conducted using subjects who responded to advertisements to ae wspepers CPederson aad Lefcoel97g; or were contacted by word of mouth (Trahar 1967). The subjects iu tbese studies had either quit sinking recently, had quit smoking for more than 1 year, or had at least one episode of remaining abstinent for 24 hr. Although the reliability of these data is limited because they are from retrospective self-reports, they provide information on the prevalence and nature of symptoms which may be experienced by smoke-deprived persona and acutely abstinent smokers.

Symptoms reported by significant numbers of ex-smokers included: "earing" for tobacco (Hughes, Gust, Pechacek 1987; Trahirl967: Banai 1969; Manager 1970; Pederson aad Lefcoe 1976); restlessness. n* Hrpuiiw.aa. or irritability CTrahir 1967; Wynder, Kaufman. Leaser 1967; ftirns 1969; Mausaer 1970; Hughes, Gust. Pechacek 1987); anxiety (Hughes, Gust, Pechacek 1987); impatience (Hughes, Gust. Pechacek 1967}; difficulty concentrating (TVahir 1967; Wynder. Kaufman. lesser 1967; Hushes, Gust. Pechacek 1967% somatic or physical complaints {Hughes, Gust. Pc hacek 1957; Ffcderson and Lefcoe 1976); increased appetite (Wynder, Kaufman. lesser 1967; Hughes, Gust, Pechacek 1987k increased food intake (Wynder. Kswfman, Leaser 3967k aad weight gain CTrahir 1967; Wynder, Kaufman. Lesser 1997; Mausaer 1970; Pedcraon and Lefcoe 1976). Meaaums of tha incidence and magnitude of signs and symptoms vary acnes studies, at lease partly because of tbe diversity of the

299

Seventy-eight percent of the subjects reported four or ujor* DSM-IXI criteria. This degree of prevalence was higher than that found in a jetiuspective study conducted by Hughes, Oust, and Pechacek (1987^ possibly reflecting differences in tbe measuring instruments or tbe populations themselves.

"The physiological changes which have been found to occur after cigarette deprivation include decreased heart rate (Knapp, Kiss, Wells 1963; Murpbee aad Schultz 1968; Parsons. Avery et aL 1975; Benowitz, Kuyt, Jacob 1984; Wattwkami et aL 1984; Weybrew aad Stark 1967; Gilbert and Pope 1982; Hughes and Hatsukaxni 1986; West aad Russell 1987; Kgexot 1978; West, Jarris et aL 1964; ffrnningfieM 1987a? aad decreased conical arousal aa evidenced by decreases in peak alpha frequency and increases in low frequency activity which appear to be aiwooated with drowsiness and declassed vigilance (Knott aad Venablee 1977, 1979; Ulett aad 2t0 1969; Hemiag, Jooea, Rachnum 1963; Homing 1967). Knott aad Vaoables (1973) have aha? found that tbe visual evoked zeapoaae in tobacco-deprived smokers showed faster latencies and larger amplitudes ibr lowstunulus u'ltaiisilaw than among soodeprived smokers aad nonsmokers. They concluded that deprived smokers experience CMS hypersensitivity and, as a result, may experience- visual stimulus input more easily and strongly. Hall and colleagues (1973) reported reduced auditory evoked response (ATR} amplitudes ""'"f tobacco withdrawal. Blood pressure (Benowia, Kuyt, Jacob 1964; Murphee and Schultx 1968; Knapp, BSas, Wells 1963) and respiratory rate (Parsons et aL 1976) have also been found to decrease during abstinence. Studies lave also reported an increase in alda temperature among tobacco-deprived smokers (Gilbert aad Pope 1982; Myrsten, Hgerot. Sdgzea 1977) or no change (West and Bussell 1987L aad either a decrease (fageislrian 1978? or ao significant change (Hattukami et aL 1964} in body temperature among those who are classified as more dependent. Although some studies have i eye* ted iitwmiua aad deep disturbance following tobacco deprivation, tffaicco-deprired smokera* total sleep time may be longer during withdrawal (Seddatoset at 1980% Reported changes in sleep pattern include docrsaaad latency to rapid-eye-movesneat GSE2&) deep (Bales et aL 1970% decreased latency to light (delta etectwen-cepbalograsi (EEG) wave) sleep onset (Pa&aoa. Luttna* es. aL 197$; Parsons and Hsmrnn 1976X aad increased focal SEX sleep time CSoldatos et aL I960; Kales etai 1970; Parsons, Avery et aL 1975). Another phywir-al change found among tofaanro-depuwl smokers is aa increase in weight (Gruabexg 2996; aee also Chapter VO- Weight iacrease has also been found among those who quit smoking in a number of longitudinal survey studies (Boase, Gervay, Costa I960). This iacrease in weight has been attributed to increased caloric intake (Hatsukami et aL 1964; Grunberg 198% Myrsten. Sgerot,

Several studies have examined the effects of cigarette deprivation and administration on reaction time and psychomotor performance. These are reviewed in detail in Chapter VI and are only briefly summarized here. Two early studies each found considerable across-subject variability, with some subjects showing distinct deprivation-induced performance impairments which were lerejsed by tobacco administration, and other subjects showing impairments under the tobacco administration conditions (Bates 1922; Garter 1922). Since tbe studies by Bates and Carver, investigators have developed increasingly sophisticated methods of performance assessment which, hove led to a clearer understanding of the pexformance-rciated effects of nicotine ariniinafljratfoa aad deprivation (see details in Chapter VTX Fur eamapse, Heaastra. Bancroft, aad DeKock (1967) used a simulated driving task aad found that deprived smokers made significantly mora errors on tracking and vigilance tasks than did noonepri ted amukeus or aoosaiokwsv who did aot significantly differ faaneiach other. Otfacjreooarch has denKjrwtrated that smokers who were allowed to smoke agarettes during the experioteatal cession crhihtod either ao decrease or an improvement in speed aad accuracy in reaction time, cognitive tests, and/or vigilance perfor-maace tasks, whereaa derived smokers most frequently show some impairment xa performance tasks (Myrsten et aL 1972; Fnafeen-hae-user et aL 1971; Blgerot 1978; TQeinman.

A recent study ueaag a ttanputerixed battery of auch taska found dear impairments beginning within 8 hr of the last cigarette aad improving onb/ sosnewhat across 10 consecutive days of tobacco deprivation; resumption of smoking was awn tpanied by complete restoration of performance (Benaingfiekl 1987aX The specificity of these peafwmance effects of nicotine was confirmed hy the findings tiiat administration of nicotine in the polacrilex gum form produced a doaa related reversal of aS performance impairments (Snyder and Hrnmngfjesd. in press; HeaaiagSaid 1967ak this effect waa. aot related to satisfaction or redaction of "craving** because the gum produced down related ducixiawa in "Kkfog" scopes and produced no reliable du, iumjij in "desire to smoke" (Hwira^Sekl 1987a).

Ihe last 25 years have witnessed phenomena] changes in die way Americans dunk about tobacco use. More people now than ever before consider smoking to be outside the social norm. Anusmokirtgpra^amsttidpc^iciesliavecoutr^u^todttsdianee. This shift in socicsal attitudes is atoo certain to genciatcad^ limit the ose of tobaeco.

Almost half of aI3 tiviog Americans who ever smefced have quit. This is especially remarkable when one takes into account the powerful media images enticing people to smoke and 0c powerfully addkave nature of nicotine. As, the downward trends in smofciog behavior cominwe, we can expect to sec a decline in the number of prcmafrrc deaths and avoidable morbidity due to smoking.

For now, however, we must recognize. Oat continued tobacco exposure in the population will cause a. great deal of human suffering for rnaay decades. Thus, we must aot rest upon tbe Jaurdsof rhe past quarter century.

PREFACE

Exactly 25 years ago. on Jaoaary II. 1964, Luther L. Terry. MIX. Swgeon General of tbe UJS. Pablic Health Service, released *e report of the Surgeon General's Advisory Couwrattee on Smoking and Health. That landmark docomew. now leferred so asdic first SofgeoRGemaTs Report on Smokh^and Hearth, was America's first wide-Jy publicized official nxognkioa that cigarette smoking is a cause of cancer and other serious diseases.

On the basis of more than 7,00Qanicfcs relating to smoking and disease already avail-able at dux rime ia die biomedical Steramre, the Advisory Committee ccodaded that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer in men. a probable cause of fang cancer in women, and ihe most important cause of chronic bronchitis. The Comotiaee staled tbat "C^arette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient impor-tance in the United States to waiaut aupmuuate remedial actio**.""

What would coifttilBtr ""approuriaa, rrmnfial actioo** was left wi^wytfied. But tbe release of the report was die first ia a series of steps, still being taken 25 years later. > diminish theiiiipart o* ajoacco use oo das health of Ihe Aiucijcan people.

This 1989 Report, the 20Ain a series of Sorgeon GeneraJ's Reports oo tbe Health Consequences of Smoking. apeSs out the dramatic progress that has been achieved in the past quaner century against cue of our deadliest risks.

The cacumsfances samsotxSng the release of the 1rw report in 1964 are worth tunc, inhering. The date chosen was a Satmday morning, to guard agaii&t a pteciprtocs reaction on WaO Street. An aacfitoruan in the State Department was selected becaase as sccurirycouldbeassured4t had been the site for presscoufcrcncesof the fate Ftest-detw John F. Kennedy, whose awswinarlon had occurred less than 2 months earlier.

The first two copies of the 387-page. brown<oeiuJRi4JOit wiu. hand delivered to rhe West Wing of the Wbise House at 7:30 oo that Saturday morning. At9gQ.ac-credited press representatives were admitted a? the auditoriixn and "locked in,** wnhovt access to telephones. Sotgeoo General Terry and his Advisory Committee took tbeir seats on the platform. The Report was dfatribwted and reporter* were allowed 90 minutes to read it, Questions were ausweced hy Dr. Terry and his Committee members. Finally, the doors were opened and (he news was spread. Fbr several days, tbe Repcttrorwshed newspaper headlines scr^ aewscasts. Later it was tanked among the top news stories of 196*.

Advisory Conwuktee's call for "appropriate remedial action.'- Earfy on. tbe U.&. Congress adopted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 and rhe

in

Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969. These laws teamed 3 health warning on cigarette packages, banned cigarette advertising in die broadcast media, and called for an annual report on die health consequences of smoking.

In 1964, die Public Health Service established a small unit called the National OearinghouseforSmokingandHeaitMNCSH). Through the years, the Clearinghouse and its successor organization, tbe Office on Smoking and Health, have been responsible for die 20 reports on the health consequences of smoking previously mentioned, eigN of whkh have been issuedduringmy tenure asSargeonGeneral. In close coopera-tkxiwidi voluntary health organizations, the PutoSc Healdi Service has suppc* red highly successful school and community programsonsmokinga^ research rmdings related to tobacco use, and has ensured the continued public visBHliry of aotisraoking messages.

Throughout this period, tremendous changes have occurred. As detailed in das Report, we have wtoessed expansion in scientific knowledge of the health hazards of smoking, growing public knowledge of the dangers of smoking, increased availability of programs  prevent young people from starting to smoke and to help smokers quit, and widespread adoption of policies thai discourage the use of tobacco.

Most important, these developments have changed ihe way in which our society views smoking. In rhe 1940s and 1950s, smoking was chic: i*ow, increasingly, it is shunned. Movie stars, sports heroes, and other celebrities used to appear in cigarette advertisements. Today, actors, athletes, public figures, and poEtkal candidates are tardy seen smoking. The ashtray is following die spiuwuinto oblivion.

Within this evolvmg social mifiea. ihe population has been giving ap smoking in increasing manbers. Nearly half of aO living adults who ever smoked have quit. The most impressive decline in smoking has occurred among toco. Smoking prevalence among men has fallen from 50 percent in 1965 to 32 percent in 1987. These changes represent nothing, less than a revolution in behavior.

Tbeancismofciagcampaigahasbeeaaraajorpublichealibsaccess. Those who have participated *n duscarnpauja can (ake tremendous pride *h die progress that has been oaade.

The analysis in dris Report shows that in die absence of the campaign, there would have been 91 million American smokers < 15 io 84 years of age) in 1985 instead of 56 rnOSon. Asaiesafc<rfdedonsq^smokM^orotostari.aoestuaaaed7eyX)00 smoking-related deaths were avoided or postponed between 1964 and 1985. Fuflher-raore;d*ese decisions wairesah in the avoidants or ytttlpuMcmet* of ^ million smoking-related deaths between 1986 and die year 2000.

This achievement has few parallels in the history of public health. It was accomplished despite the addictive nature of tobacco and tbe powerful economic forces pronygingiaise.

The Remaining Challenges

Despite tins achievement, smoking will continue as the leading cause of preventable, premature death formany years to come, even if all smokers were toquk today. Smoking cessation is clearly beneficial in reducing (he risk of dying from smoking-related

iv

rfhrav^ However, for some diseases, such as fang cancer and emphysema, quitting may not reduce the risk to the level of a lifetime noosmoker even after many years of abstinence. This residual health risk is one reason why approximately 390,000 Americans died ia I9SS as the result of smoking, even after two decades of declining smoking rates.

The critical message here is that pwgress in curtailing smoking must continue, and ideally accelerate, to enable us to turn smoking-related mortality around. Otherwise, die disease impact of smoking wiB remain high well into the 21st century.

Just maintaining ihe current rate of progress is a cbaBenge. Compared wirh non-smokers, smokers are disproportionately found ia groups that are harder to reach, and this disparity may increase over tunc Greater effort and resources will need to he devoted k> achieve equivalent reductions in smoking amoog those whose behavior has survived strong, countervailing social pressures.

Today, thanks to the remarkable progress of tbe past 25 years, we can dare to envision asmoke-free society. Indeed it can be said that die social tide is flowing toward dtat bold objective. To matntaia momentum, we need to direct special attention to the following groaps within oar society:

Introduction

Ibis Chapter analyees treads ia public beliefs, atutwfes. and <^itnioca about smoking. Im divided faro three sections. Tbe first describes trends in pubUc beliefs rcgard-ing the health effects of smoking, the second describes trends in public attitudes about smokers aid smoking, and the third describes sends in public opinion about smoking policies.

At the outset, a is important pdefiae and clarify the impona^ Chapter. Tenasux&^knowledge,awareness,opinions.beliefe.andaofa lurnraoosensc mranings to die fay person, but mote complex meanings to the social scientist. For example. Attport(I935> reviewed many definitions of attitude and con-gructcd his own compcebeusivc definition: "An aokude is a mental or neural state of readiness, organized through experience, exerting a directive or dynamic influence upon die individual's response to alt Objects and situations with which it is reiaed." Entire books have been devoted r> die science of defining and measuring public attitudes, opinions, and beliefs (cvg, Oskamp 1977).

I*or sections two and dace of this Chapter, which deal wid* attitudes and opinions, the commonplace aodHujint'iig of these terms will suffice. Far the first section. however, which covers beftets about facahh effects, a more careful approach is war-ranted. This Section generally follows the construct described fey Hsbtetn <1977X which embraces three levels of belief:

1.     Level 1 (awareness): AperaoomybeBevcthat'^SatgeoBGeacglhasdrtrT-mined dm cigarette smoking isdangcrous to bcahh."

2.     Level 2 (general acceptance): A perscw may beHeve thai "cigareste smoking is dangerous a> health-**

3.     Level 3 (pcrwnafiied acceptance): A person may befieve that "ray cigarette smoking is dangerous to my heater*."

Most of the stnvey data taeiemed ia (be first section address Level 2 beliefs. At times, the term public knowledge is ased to refer  public beliefs (LeveJ 2 betters at die population levcQ. There are few data regarding Level 1 beliefs: consequently, use of the terms jwjtmess aad public awareness is guncjalry avoided- Data pertinent to Level 3 beliefs are available from a fewsurveys in three forms: (1) questions asking wbed>ersnr>oking"isharnrful a>yo*irhe^m": C2)questions asking w          ie*pu*iilcHCt

are *>cooccTned"aboat the effects ctfsrocfcing on fheyhcahfa; and ffl whether respondents beBeve that they are less likely, as likely, or more likely than other people to be adversely affected by smoking. These levels of beliefs are discussed in more depth later in this Chapter.

Data Sources

The iufu* nunion ut^sri ard ia this Chapter is derived from three principal sources: 1.    NatkmaBy representative surreys conducted by tbe US. Public Heafcn Service from I964-J7. including the Adult Use of Tobacco Surveys (AtTFSs) (1964. 1966.1970.1975. I9S6) and the National Health Interview Surveys (NWSs) (1985.1987). The ^IS questions were part of the Health Promotion an^

ease Prevention Supplement in 19S5 and ihe Cancer Control Supplement in 1987. Tbe surveys tor 1964-75 used, for the roost parr, the same metbodsand questionnaire wording- DifTererurncalxidsandanestioiuiaaeswereusiedinsub-scque nt surveys.

2.     Nationally representative surveys conducted by privsne organizations, such as GaUttp and Roper, tad sponsored by various organizations.

3.     Natwt*aisurvevsofpopulaiionstri>s"w^rorIocalsBrvcys- These .surveys were used, for the most pan, only when nationally representative data wcreunavaii-abtc

Data fmn these surveys are presented in several tables throughout this Chapter, each ofwhich addresses beliefs or open ions about a particular smoking-related scientific fact or policy. When one ofthe primary data sources (e^g.. the AUTS) is not included ia a table, k is because the relevant question was not asked m die survey or survey year or because tbe data were not available.

Preliminary first-quarter estimates from die Cancer Control Supplement to the 1987 NHiS are prwickdmsomc tables (unpunished d

data are unweighted. When available, year-end weighted data are cited: in all cases, these figures are very similar to the first-quarter estimates.

Issues in Comparing Surveys

When assessing Bends from different surveys conducted at different limes by dif-fcrciMorgarwratk)is.K isimpooantioconsider d*efoUowjftgcaveats. Tbe response to each specific qucstkmdcpcfc upon multiple factors.*^

lectioo (cg ia penon versus telephone), the sociodemogmphic representativeness of die sample, the exact wonting of the question (e^. bold. direct-sounding questions versus conservative-sounding statements), the type of response allowed or requested {e^.. open- versus closed-ended questions), die order of quest ions within die survey, and the content and sauire of the resuifthe surrey (c^asun^

titg versus another of a general topic). Even minor changes in the survey methods or questionnaire wording may lead  markedly discrepant results for a specific question.

Additional precautions exist when interpictingsiavcys that assess publk knowledge. When asked a knowledge question, respondents may attempt to answer it "correctly*" in order to please die interviewer. The Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Sup-ptanemtothe I9&SNH1S sheds light on this question. In this survey (IfCHS 1986). respondents were asked whether smoking iuu uses the risk ofdcvdopingvaiar.tmanrt gag bbdderdtscase-twocuodftionsaot associated with smoking. The extent to which these types of qacsaons (souk ti*nr* called **rad herrings") are amwmjd in the affirmative food thus incotrecdy) may reflect the reipondrms* general tendency to respond in tbe affirmative. More than 85 percent of respondents reported that smoking causes emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and laryngeal, esophageal, and lung caaeer. however. 11 perccatand t6perce reported thatsa>okirj causes gallsiooesandcaaracis^ avery. The responses u*d*ca*tag a connection between smoking and cataracts or gaB bladder disease may tepteseiit misinformed bcKefs or a bias from aneroptinggi answer ktiowtedgeque niun*. "correctly .** There are other possible explanations, however. For instance, diescrespocses (as weBasodier"coiTect" responses) may represents^ ces that respondents have made, ia some cases regarding questions they have never               ,-

(bought about. In these cases, some persons may he inclined to infera connection be-              &

twecaaknowfl risk behavior and any dbeasetuueutne.

In tbe case of questions about public knowledge (e.g_"Ooyou drink that smoking is or is aot a cause of lung cancer?**), the "don't know" response should be induded in trie deaumkuaoc when cafadating the ptoporw ticutar fact. This process was used for calculating unpublished data presented betow.

Whcs two *i-\ c> produce ftfjMytfd <jr Jivr^.i: *cmhU. m uwc muv^M f the methods often explains the findings. Two examples involve survey* of public opinion about smoking policies. In one case, two sepat^ notional surveys conducted ai 1986 regarding support for a baa on cigaietre advertising provided .jptMreotlydis-crcpant results (American Medical Association (AMA) 1986). A careful reviewof tbe questionnaire wonfing revealed marked differences in die remarks made just prior to eacbqucstion. lo a survey conducted for AMA. respondents were fust utformed about

There are at least three reasons these questions might be expected to evoke dtfEereja responses. First, tbe wotding prior to each question n*ay have biased the respondents one to align with the sponsoring agency's policy aad the other to consider the legal an-plicatioasofsuchaban. Second, the Grst survey asked whether cigarette advertising should be banned while die second asked whether cigarette advertising should be permittee*.

Overview

The health consequences of smoking are weUdocu(netMedand widely acknowledged ia the scientific liicrature(seeChap4er2in this R^

Advisory Conumaee on Smoking aad Health, after an extensive review of tbe literature, reported that cigarette smoking was causally associated with tuag and laryngeal cancer in men, was the most important cause of chronic bronchitis, and was Associated with esophageal cancer. Madder cancer, coronary artery disease, emphysema, peptic uJcer. and tow-binhweighi babies (US PHS1964).

During the 25-year period since 1964. subsequent reports of the Surgeon General have updated and extended the findings of the Advisory Committee. The purpose of this Seeaicn is to delenninc tbe extent which u

to and accepted by the ULS. public. Public knowledge of the health risks of smoking can be considered under three broad categories: whether smoking is harmful tohe^th BgcneratandwbedKTSmcAcrsperceiverh^

The percentages of those eonecdy identifying this statement as false were 59 percent <tf black men. 76 percent of whire men, 42 percent of black women, and 60 percent of white women. Those who considered the statement to be true may believe low-tar and -iric&tBic cigarettes to be less hazardous.

Duration of Smoking

Overall mortality ratios for smokers compared with nonsmokers increase with die duration of smoking. OvetaQ mortality rates among smokers c slightly above the rates of nonsmokers for tbe first 5 to 15 years of smoking but then increase more rapkS-ly ar, the years of smoking increase (USDHEW 1979a). Mortality ratios for lung cart-cer. coronary heart disease (CHDX. and COPD increase with decreasing age of initiation (US DHHS 1982.1983.1984). An increased risk of morbidity <e.g.. as measured by days of hospitalization, bed disability, and work lost) among smokers may occur much earlier than increases *n mortality fititos.

The 1964 AUTC asked rry*a*V4ii^"l tow mariy cigarettes^ day for how rruuiy years might make a cigarette smoker more Etody to gel lung cancer?" Most of those who considered smelting to be a cause of lungr^nryr Irehevcd that sa*oku*g would iia irjsr the risk of lung canoerooly after at least 10 years of smoking (regardless of the number of cigareoes smoked per day) (Table 6X

The 1986 AUTS asked respcndens.~How lo*^ wooktapersonhave tosmokc<oum-ber) of cigarettes eac&d^bexe it would alto Aeir (sic) health?" Theoumberof rigatmm used laihK question was the number identified by tbe icspoodcut(in tfaepre-rious question) as d*at which "a person would have to smoke before it would affect fteir (sic) health" (see Tatfe 5). A majority of respondents in aB smoking categories believed dun smoking 10 or fewer years would affect a person's health. Aiugbcrper-evmgr of never smokers- (3d percent) than tuncot sroukcrs (23 percent) Believed mat smoking less than 1 year would aScct a person's health. Correspondingly, a. slightly higher percentage of current smokers (IO percent) than never smokers (5 percent) believed that beaks effects would occur only after at least 15 years of smoking (Table Tt

smokers (3D percent). Similarly, smokers were less likely to acknowledge an assocja-rion between smoking andempbysemafSS percent) dan were former smokers (92 percent) and never smokers (90 percent). Similar patterns were seen in (be earlier surveys.

QrAerCimcm?

Laryngeal and esophageal ameer. By 1964. smoking was identified as a cause of laryngeal cancer in men: art association between smoking aad cancer of ihe esophagus was abo noted, although the data were not considered sufficient io establish a causal relationship at that time (US PKS 1964). An estimated 75 to 90 percent of laryngeal and esophageal cancer deaths are attributed to smoking, and smokers have mortality ones from there diseases that arcappeoxknatclySto 13 times higher (baa those of never smoker* (Ouster 3}.

Since 1977. public beliefs that smoking increases the risk of developing caocerof the larynx and esophagus have aot changed substantially (Table II). In 1977.79 percent of adults reported that smoking is ooeofihe causes of throat cancer. In E985,80pcr-ccat of adults thought that smoking increasesa person's risk of devetopiqg esophageal cancer and 88 percent thought that smoking increases the risk of acqoiriag laryngeal cancer. Use of different wording io describe the cancer site (throat, Iaqmgeal, esophageal, "mouth and throat") makes comparisons ruwxig these surveys difficult

ltt 1986, current smokejs were less likely co acknowledge a relationship between smoking and laryngeal cancer (82 percent) than were former smokers <9l percent) or' never smokers (91 percent). Similar patterns werescen in theearfiersunreysand in the preliminary 19f*7NKK data (Table 11).

Bladder eancer. Tbe 196* Report of die Surgec-a General's Advisory Comntittee identified aa association buwctn smoking and cancer of the bladder, although rhe evidence was *KXtwosideredsufl*ciemtoesra&BshacaBsalreladoaship(USPHS 1964). TTuny-seven to rony-seven percent of bladder cancer deaths are bow attributable to smoking (Chapter 3X-

Few data are available co public knowledge about the association between agnefcirtg aod cancer of the bladder. The 1979 Chiton Survey (Chittoo 1980) showed that 2S percent of aduit respondents (29 3l years of age) believed that "cancer of the Mad-der (has) been found to be associated with cigarette smoking." Lithe 1983MHXS. 36 pc rccat of adults drought: that cigarette smalung definitely or probably increases a person's risk of developing bbdder cancer, fa rhe 1986 AUTS. 33 percent of aduhs thought daw smokers are more Btefy than oorftmofcers *o develop bladder cancer. Gr-tent smokers were less likely to acknowledge dus relationship (2S percent) than were former smokers (32 percent) and never smokers (38 percent).

V.Tjit Are thcSpenai Keaith Risks tor Women?

The special health risks for women include cfiects of stroking cn pregnancy outcome, increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among smokers who use oral contraceptives, and increased risk of cervical cancer in women who smoke (Chapters 2and3). Data exist on public beliefs regarding the first twoof these three categories of risk.

A study carried out in two successive decades, in whioh successively autopsied airways from lungs of smokers wero studied for bronchial epithelial changes, demonstrated a decrease In changes thought to be related to carcinogenesis {S). This favorable change was thought to be related to tho Increasing use of lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes. Unfortunately, this study did not examine the lungs for evidence of chronic obstructive lung disease.

Future Rosearoh Approaches

Animal models in which emphysema has been induced by elastolytic eneymes have been reported by a number of authors CM), but for treasons that may reflect a combination of factors, such as the shorter life span of animals, the method of smoke exposure, and species resistance, there are no published studies that acceptably show in an animal model that the development of emphysema is induced by cigarette smoking. Thus, a successful animal model has not been developed in which the relationship of different types of cigarettes to the development of emphysema oan be studied, One study in which dogs received smoke directly through chronic tracheotomies reported the development of emphysema {S). The lesions were not conclusive and the results have not been confirmed by others. Therefore, to elucidate more clearly the differences between regular and lower W and nicotine cigarette smoke exposure, It will be neeeasaiy to study other aspects of lung function, either biochemical or physiological, that may be altered by the cigarette smoke and that are projected to be important pathogenetic mechanisms in humans.

As suggested in the preceding paragraphs, much new information will be needed before conclusions can be drawn about the effect of lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes on the development of COLD. Acute and subacute responses oould be measured by physiologic studies, although such responses may not be relevant to the development of chronic, irreversible lung disease. The quantity and composition of mucus secreted in the airways in response to different types of cigarettes may be studied in animals or humans. The histology of the bronchial mucosa may be evaluated in human material from lobes or lungs resected for other reasons, from biopsy specimens, or from post mortem findings in which changes related to chronic bronchitis or emphysema are specifically quantitated. In autopsy or resected lunge from smokers of regular and of lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes, factors in the small airways such as lumen stee, number of plrweys, cell types, goblet cells, muscle hypertrophy, and inflammation may be evaluated. Enzyme inhibitors produced in the tracheobronchial tree could also be evaluated, as oould the warotton of immune globulins. Effecto of cigarette smoke on the mucociliary function of the bronchial mucosa is another potential measurement

0. The rapid clinical evaluation of the recently developed biochemical tests that measure products of lung elastin degradation and that can be detected in the plasma or urine should be carried out. If those prove both specific and sensitive, the time involved in carrying out the human epidemiologic research could be shortened, 4. Human, animal, and in vitro research that studies the mechanisms responsible for COLD and their possible alteration by lower "tar" and nicotine smoke should receive emphasis. Although the etas-tase-Inhibitor imbalance hypothesis is well supported by experimental studies, confirmation of this mechanism Is required for human disease. Verified animal models of emphysema Induced by cigarette smoke exposure are not available at this time, but If such a model can be identified, it should be exploited. Investigation should involve airway factors, parenchymal alterations, end alterations in defense mechanisms that can be studied in short-term or subacute experiments. Biochemical, histological, and ultmtructural studies are required for correlation with exposure to smoke products or components from regular or lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes. Dosimetry or exposure levels for these studies can bo drawn from topographic and epidemiologic studies. Research on both animal and human tissue, cells, and lung lavage fluid is required. Much progress has been made in recent years in the study of the mechanisms of lung damage relating to cigarette smoke. However, chronic bronchitis and emphysema are potentially devastating illnesses that have no curative treatment Elimination of cigarette smoking would significantly reduce their public health importance. It is imperative that we define as aoon as possible any differences in the effect of currently manufactured lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes in the pathogenesis of these diseases,

Summary

1. The relationship between cigarette smoking and chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD) Is well documented. The constituents of cigarette smoke that are responsible are currently not known, Whether a difference in risk of COLD has occurred with lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes as compared with higher "tar" and nicotine cigarettes is currently unknown,

& Cigarette smoking is associated with the release by alveolar macrophages of an increased amount of the elastolytic enzymes, which degrade alveolar tissue, and with reduced activity of elphai-antitrypsin, the primary elastase inhibitor. This tnechanfom has not yet been directly related to the development of human emphysema. To date there are no published studies that compare

for tho 1978 and 1970 NHIS date sots aw based on the PTC listing of cigarette varieties, sampled in 1977 and published in May 1978, and updated to include cigarettes identified by the PTC as marketed in July 1978.

Three major conclusions can be elicited, First, Government and other agency activities in recent decades have led to widespread public recognition of the health hazards of smoking cigarettes. Second, the marked increase in the use of filter-tipped cigarettes in the late 1950s has been followed by a reduction In the Htar" and nicotine content of the cigarette products actually being selected and used by the smoking population. Third, the role of cigarettes of varying levels of "tar" and nicotine in the initiation, maintenance, or cessation of smoking is unknown. The data from the National Center for Health Statistics presented here neither prove nor disprove a role of lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes in easing initiation, increasing daily consumption among regular smokers, or decreasing the probability of attempting to quit or of succeeding in the attempt, Much further work remains to be done to clarify and define the effects of tower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes on these behaviors, and thus their effect on total lifetime patterns of cigarette smoke exposure.

The Growth In Ihe Use of tower "Tor" and Nlootln* cigarettes

An Increasing Public Awareness of the Health Hasardi of Cigarette Smoking

The decades sinoe the first medical report* of a link between lung cancer and tmoklng in the 1950s have seen multiple changes in the cigarette products being used by the smoking population (t 1, H, IS, 1$, ts). A number of factors may have encouraged these changes.

The U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) has been active in assessing and attempting to reduce the excess burden of preventable ill noes related to cigarette smoking. Its first comprehensive review of the evidence linking dgarette smoking and adverse health effects by the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service in 1964 was followed by regularly issued reports from 1966 through 1980, each of which continued and extended the PHS concern. In 1966, the PHS submitted to Congress (W) the Tkvhnioal Report on "Tar" and Nicotine. On the basis of the clear demonstration of cigarette dose-dependent risks of several diseases, the PHS concluded:

The preponderance of scientific evidence strongly suggests that the lower the "tar" and nicotine content of cigarette smoke, the less harmful would be the effect,

We recommend ... the progressive reduction of the "tar" and nicotine content of cigarette smoke.

J"                   percent of the persons Interviewed agreed and 184 disagreed, but in

i                   1676,84.9 percent agreed and 11,8 percent disagreed, with tntermedl-

jj.                   ate figures occurring In 1970 (49, SS, $9), Substantial differences were

i                   apparent when smoking history was considered. In 1964, totmr

F                   smokere believed smoking to be harmful In 90.6 percent of interviews,

while only 69.6 percent of the current smokers believed smoking

;                    harmful; only 7,4 percent of former smokers did not agree that

!                     smoking Is harmf ut, but 21,9 percent of smokers did not agree (**).

This difference by smoking status in the percentage of interview

subjects who believed smoking to be harmful persisted In 1976, but the

difference narrowed (7$ percent of current smokers agreed and 91,6

percent of former smokers agreed) (39). Very similar results were

reported in a large survey in 1978, which found that 90 percent of all

persons and BS percent of smokers believed smoking to be harmful to

health (?).                                                                       ut                      ..

The percentage of smokers who agreed that "cigarette smoking frequently causes disease and death" increased from oZ2 percent in 1966 to 70.7 percent In 1976; the proportion of smokers who disagreed declined from 87.6 percent in 1966 to 22.8 percent in 1976. The percentage of the total population who had no opinion on this question and the preceding question declined from 9,1 percent to 6*8 percent and from 4,7 percent to 8.4 percent, respectively. This suggests that educational efforts may have reduced the alee of the "undecided" population.

Other questions assessed the personal impact of beliefs about the health haaords of cigarette smoking. Although the percentage of smokers who reported being "slightly" concerned about the possible effects of smoking on their own health remained fairly constant from 1966 (18.1 percent) to 1976 (18.9 percent), the proportion of smokers who were "fairly" or *'vwyf' conoerned increased from 29,1 percent in 1966 to 47.6 percent in 1976. The number of smokers "not concerned" declined from 62,6 percent in 1966 to 81.6 percent in 1976.

For the entire population, the proportion of interviewees who agreed that "smoking (is) enough of a hazard for something to be done about it" increased from 76.8 percent in 1966 to 84.0 percent In 1976.

Additionally, one question asked of current smokers in 1966,1970, and 1976 provides information on smokers' perceptions of varying haeards by cigarette type (M, S6, i0). The number of smokers who felt that "all oigarettes (are) probably equally hasardous" declined from

57.8 percent in 1966 to 40.6 percent in 1076, while tho number of smokers who believed that "some cigarettes (are) more hazardous than others" Increased from 29.9 percent in 1966 to 40,1 peroent in 1976. Among smokers who believed there was a difference among cigarette brands in health hatsard, current smokers who believed their own cigarette brand was lest heaardoua than other kinds declined from 69,9 percent in 1966 to 49.7 percent in 1976, and smokers who believed their cigarette brand was mr* hatardoua increased from 12,6 percent to 20.4 percent, Thus in the period from 1966 to 1976, there was an increasing proportion of smokers who believed different dgarettea posed varying health risks, but among these smokers the proportion who felt their cigarette was more dangerous to health than other cigarettes also increased. Unfortunately, Identical large surveys to assess subsequent trends either In smokers' beliefs about differences in health risks or about the role of such beliefs In affecting cigarette product choice have not been published since 1976.

The Tobacco Institute, which represents the cigarette manufacturers, has also supported periodic surveys of attitudes, Their most recent survey is publicly available, Oonduoted in 1078 (Jl), this survey found that more than 90 percent of the U.S. population believed cigarette smoking is hazardous to the health of the smoker. Fully 61 percent believed that any amount of smoking is hazardous, up from 47 percent In 1970. This is in close agreement with surveys perf ormed by the PH8 in 1970. Further, In 1970 and 1978, 42 percent and 60 percent, respectively, of the population surveyed believed that smoking "makes a great deal of difference in longevity," a higher percentage than those believing the name thing about fatty diets (48 percent), alcohol consumption (89 percent), lack of exercise (84 percent), and overweight (24 percent).

The proportion of all persons who believe smokers "have" or "probably have" more of "certain illnesses" has increased from 66 percent In 1970 to 62 percent in 1978, when only 11 percent believed that smokers do not suffer more illness. Only 8 percent of people surveyed did not believe that cigarette smoking is a cause of disease, a figure that has not changed appreciably since 1970.

The 1978 Roper Survey found that the proportion of the population who believed others' smoking is hazardous to the nonsmoker's health had increased from 46 percent in 1974 to 68 percent in 1978. In 1978, the number who believed passive or Involuntary smoking to be harmful was 69 percent among nonsmokers; while among smokers it was 40 percent For the first time, the health effect of involuntary smoking was cited most frequently as a reason for legislation to ban cigarette smoking in public places,

Sum maty

1. Public awareness of the dangers of smoking has steadily increased since 1965. In 1978, more than 90 percent of all Americans believed cigarette smoking to be hwardout to health.

2. Cigarette product choice has shifted dramatically since the 1960s. In 1979, 91,7 percent of U.S. smokers used filter-tipped dgarettes, compared with 1-4 percent In the early 1950s.

8. Lower "tar" cigarettes conventionally have been defined as yielding 16 m^ of "tar" or less per cigarette, The proportion of all cigarettes consumed in the United States that are lower "tar" has increased from 8.6 percent in 1970 to almost 60 percent In 1979. In 1979,68,6 percent of all cigarette brands marketed in the United States yielded 16 or fewer mg of "tar."

4, Since 1968, the "tar" content of the "average dgarotto" in the United States has declined by 82,2 percent, and nicotine content has fallen by 26.6 percent These dedlnes may be partially accounted for by lower tobacco weight per cigarettedown 28* percent from 1968 to 1978-and by the greater length of the filter and overwrap of the average cigarette, which oould result in a declining number of machine puffs per cigarette,

beset with major difficulties because of toxicity introduced by high carbon monoxide concentration* (generally 8,6 to 5 volume percent), and high levels of nicotine. Furthermore, laboratory animals are not willing to inhale aerosols very deeply and are especially reluctant to inhale tobacco smoke. Inhalation studies have been explored by training Rhesus monkeys and baboons to smoke cigarettes. This approach does not produce respiratory neoplasms because of wsuftl* dent exposure time and because of the tendency of the animals merely to puff rather than to lnhale(/0& JBGa).

Invasive and noninvasive bronchoalveolar tumors developed in several of 78 dogs that were trained to smoke through a tracheostome and that smoked cigarettes daily for about 2V( years. In a group of 24 dogs that smoked nonfiltor cigarettes, 2 animals developed early invasive squamous cell carcinoma in the bronchi {4). However, this observation has not been repeated to far (137).

A number of inhalation studies have been conducted with rate, Recently they have yielded tumors of the respiratory tract (43,137). In 1080, investigators at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory succeeded in obtaining tumors of the respiratory'tract of rats using a highly developed smoke inhalation device (43,12, On 5 days each week over their entire lifespan, 80 rats were exposed to air-diluted smoke (10 percent) of seven oigarettes (one cigarette per hour). At the end of the experiment, a laige number of rate had developed hyperplasia or metaplasia in the epithelium of the nasal system, the larynx, or the trachea, Seven of the eighty smoke-exposed rats had tumors of the respiratory tract, including five animals with pulmonary adenomas, two with alveologenlc carcinomas, one with a squamous carcinoma of the lung, and one with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma in the nasal cavity, One alveologenio carcinoma was observed In 80 sharo-oxpoeed oontrol rata; no respiratory tract tumors were seen in 63 untreated control rats (43).

At present, the most promising animal for tobacco smoke Inhale* tion studies appears to be the Syrian golden hamster. This animal is more resistant to respiratory infections than are mice and rats and is also more tolerant of cigarette smoke (62). Dontonwill et al. developed the first smoke inhalation device and bioassay methodology-for the chronic exposure of hamsters to cigarette smoke (51). For 6 days per week and for the duration of their lifetime, the hamsters were exposed onos, twios, or three times daily for 10 minutes to air-diluted cigarette smoke (1:16). In the 8 groups of 80 hamsters, 11.8, 80, and 80,9 percent of the animals developed pro-invasive carcinoma, and 0.6,10.6, and 6.0 percent had invasive carcinoma of the upper larynx (5/), Laryngeal tumors were not observed in the oontrol group nor in the animals exposed only to the gas phase of cigarette smoke. Trachea and bronchi of all animals were free of neoplastic growth. Tumors that developed in other organs of the exposed

have not been identified, no judgment can be made as to whether they result tn new compounds or in higher concentrations of hazardous components in the smoke. The practice of flavor enrich' ment requires detailed toxlcologtcal studies that are not available at present for scientific evaluation of their health impact {116a, 169).

Research Needs and Priorities

Tobacco carcinogenesis has been intensively studied for more than 26 years by epidemiologists, chemists, biochemists, toxloologists, and pathologists. As a result, there is a much Mpanded knowledge of the major factors contributing to the toxicity and carcinogenicity of cigarette smoke, Nonetheless, significant gaps in that knowledge remain.

Benign and malignant tumors have been induced in the larynx of hamsters by long-term exposure to diluted oigarette smoke. Attempts to induce significant numbers of bronchogenic carcinoma in laboratory animals were negative in spite of major effort* with several species and strains. Neither rats nor hamsters nor baboons inhale cigarette smoke as deeply and as intensely as the cigarette smokers who have provided the data with the consequences of their "experiment" in the form of clinical evidence gathered by epidemiologists, (n view of this compelling evidence, it appears that the experimental induction of bronchogenic oarcinoma should receive limited priority as a research goal,

However, mitfor efforts should be devoted to the elucidation of the steps Involved In the formation of lung tumors. Such investigations must attempt to answer the following question* Does cigarette smoke induce entymes that activate tumor Initiators and carcinogens to their ultimate active forms? Are certain carcinogens, such as tobacco-specific N-nltrosamines, formed from smoke components in the lungs? Can the in vivo formation of suoh carcinogens in ihe lung be prevented? Is it feasible to inhibit metabolic activation and DNA binding of tobacco smoke carcinogens by ohemopreventive measures? Both prospective and retrospective studies have indicated that cigarette smokers with low serum vitamin A levels have an increased risk for lung oanoer compared with cigarette smokers with normal or high vitamin A levels {1$S, 198). Evidence from in viva and in vitro studies in carcinogenesis has supported the protective role of vitamin A {11$). Studies of the specific effects of vitamin A and retlnoic acid on the induction of lung tumors by tobacoo carcinogens are thus needed

So far, only limited attention has been given to mechanisms of induction of cancer of the esophagus, pancreas, kidney, and urinary bladder by tobacco smoke. Initial experiments support the oonoept that certain nutritional deficiencies such as those of tine and
