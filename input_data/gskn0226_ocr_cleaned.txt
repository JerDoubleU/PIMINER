--0O0--EXAMINATION BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   Good morning, Dr. Proctor.

A.   Good morning.

Q.   We've met before, but my name is Mike Quinlan and I represent R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  And I'm going to have a few questions for you here today.

A.   Okay.  Thank you.  Nice to see you again.

Q.   I'm going to jump around through a bunch of topics, so try to bear with me.  The first thing I want to talk about is what you know about Ralph Sickel. What do you know about Ralph Sickel?

A.   I only know a few of the skeletal biographical details.  I was told that he was born in 1949 in Michigan, lived in Detroit the first part of his life; started smoking either as a teenager sometime around then, apparently with Chesterfield cigarettes, then shifted over to Marlboro and Winstons, and those became his two major brands for the rest of his life; that he was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer in 1994 and died a few months later; that he had two children; that he was a Lutheran; that he did not go to college; that he worked as a -- in a Mercedes car dealership in Fort Myers.

pgNbr=11
Page 12

And those are the main things I was told this morning by Eric Roslansky.

Q.   So you beat me to my next question.

When you say you were told, who told you this information?

A.   Eric Roslansky.

Q.   Is that one of the plaintiff's lawyers in this case?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And when did Mr. Roslansky relay this information about Ralph Sickel to you?

A.   This morning.

Q.   Is that the first time you had talked to Mr. Roslansky or any attorney representing Mrs. Sickel about this case?

A. There was probably a scheduling conversation, but that would have been several months ago.

Q.   So this conversation you had this morning, that was the first substantive conversation you had about Mr. Sickel?

A.   Yes.

Q. And other than the information you relayed to me just now, is there anything else you can recall that Mr. Roslansky told you about Mr. Sickel?

A.   I don't recall anything else.  If I do, I'll

let you know.
		
	
	
	

Q.
	And
	you
	said that these were kind of
		the

skeletal
	basic
	: facts that you learned about Mr
			Sickel?

A.
	Yes.
	
	
	
	

Q.
	Did
	you
	ask to learn these
	facts, or
	did the

plaintiff
	's lawyer just tell them to
			you?
	

A.
	I as
	ked
	to get some of the
	biographical
	
details.
	
	
	
	
	

Q.
	Why
	did
	you do that?
	
	

A.
	Just to
		find out a little bit more about who
		
the plain
	tiff
	was .
	
	
	

Q.
	And
	you
	understand that there's been
		a series

of deposi
	tions
	taken in this case?
		
	

A.
	Yes.
	
	
	
	

Q.
	Have
	i  you ever reviewed any
		of those
	

depositions?
		
	
	
	

A.
	No.
	
	
	
	

Q.
	Why
	not?
		
	

A.
	They're
		not relevant to my
	testimony
	

Q.
	Why
	aren't they relevant?
		
	

A.
	Because
		I talk about, not what the cigarette
		
industry
	did to any one person, but what they did to
				
everyone.
	
	
	
	
	

Q.
	So i
	.f the specifics of Mr.
		Sickel's life that
	
you could
	learn through the depositions are not relevant

to your opinion, why did you ask for these kind of basic facts?

A.   Because they might figure into the kind of brands we discuss.  They might figure into the kind of questions I'm asked on cross.

Plus, I'm just a curious person in general. So I just like to know about all kinds of things.  You know, I like to know where you're from, where Ms. Chuang is from and so forth.

Q.   And you understand that in a deposition, there's a wealth of information you could learn about Mr. Sickel other than what Mr. Roslansky told you?

A.   You could, yes.

Q.   But you chose not to look at that information?

A.   Right.  It's not relevant.

Q.   Did Mr. Roslansky ask you to take a look at any of the depositions?

A.   No.

Q.   If he had asked you, would you have looked at them?

A.   I'm not sure.

Q.   You're not sure?

A.   I'm not sure, no.

Q.   Why not?

A.   Well, because I don't do everything the lawyers say.  And I don't see why it would be relevant. I might or I might not.

Q.   Did Mr. Roslansky ever tell you that Mr. Sickel ever tried to quit smoking?

A.   He mentioned something about that, yeah, something about him actually quitting, I think.

Q.   And do you recall when Mr. Roslansky told you that Mr. Sickel quit smoking?

A.   I think it was late, but I don't recall the details of that.

Q.   Is when Mr. Sickel quit smoking relevant, in your opinion, to your opinions in this case?

A.   No.

Q.   How about when Mr. Sickel started smoking? Is that relevant to your opinions?

A.   Not really, no.

Q.   How about the brands and cigarettes that Mr. Sickel smoked?  Is that relevant to your opinions?

A.   It's not really relevant.  It just gives me a hint as to kind of the direction the trial might take.

Q.   How about the fact that Mr. Sickel was Lutheran?  Is that relevant to your opinions?

A.   Not really.

Q.   And other than Mr. Roslansky, have you ever

talked
	to
	any other attorney representing Mrs. Sickel in
		
this case
		?
	
	

A.
	
	I don't
	think so.
	

Q.
	
	Have you ever talked to
		Mrs. Sickel or any of

the children?
			
	

A.
	
	No.
	
	

Q.
	
	Like I
	said, I'm going to bounce around a
	
little,
	so I want
		to talk quickly
	about Dr. Koop.

A.
	
	Yes.
	
	

Q.
	
	Can you
	tell me who Dr.
	C. Everett Koop was?

A.
	
	He was
	the Surgeon General under Ronald
	
Reagan
	in
	the 1980s and is, I guess, most famous for two
		
things:
	one, a bi
		g beard, and two
	,   being the leading

figure
	behind the
		1988 Surgeon General's Report, though
	
it was
	al.
	so under
	his tenure that
	there were reports on

secondhand smoke,
			smokeless tobacco, a number of other
	
topics.
	
	
	
	

Q.
	
	Do you
	recall what years Dr. Koop was the
	
Surgeon
	General?
		
	

A.
	
	I think
	it would have been around 1980 to
	
1988.
	
	
	
	

Q.
	
	And do
	you know why Dr.
	Koop left the Surgeon

General
	�s
	office?
	
	

A.
	
	No.
	
	

Q.
	
	And do
	you know what Dr
	. Koop did after he

left the Surgeon General's office?

A.   All I know is he had a Web site.  He continued on as a public health advocate.  I really don't know many details about that.

Q.   You said that Dr. Koop continued on as a public health advocate.

Is his Web site koop.com an example of some of the things he did as a public health advocate after he left the Surgeon General's office?

A.   It could be.  I haven't really looked at that Web site.

Q.   I'm going to hand you what I've marked as Exhibit 1.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 1 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   This is an article entitled "Prescription For Trouble" from Texas Monthly magazine. Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And have you ever seen this article before?

A.   I don't think so.

Q.   I'll give you a chance to review it if you like, but I want to talk about a few sections of it.

So if you'll turn to the second page for me.

A.   Okay.

Q.   You read the first sentence, it says, "It's easy to see how, in this case, it might have seemed otherwise.  'Dr. Koop has a brand name in a way that the Mayo Clinic has a brand name.'" Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Would you agree that at the time that Dr. Koop retired, he was a very well-regarded public health advocate?

A.   I think in general, that's fair.

Q.   Would you agree that his name was as strong as a brand name for the Mayo Clinic?

A.   I wouldn't know, but I wouldn't challenge it.

Q.   And I want to go to the -- about halfway down starting with a quote from Dr. Koop.  It says, "'I've had two major messages that I've tried to get out to the public all my professional life,' says the 83-year-old Koop, who in addition to chairing the company's board is Senior Scholar at the C. Everett Koop Institute at Dartmouth College, in Hanover, New Hampshire.  'One is to take charge of your own health.  The other is that there is no prescription I can give you that is more valuable than knowledge.'" Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Have you ever seen this quote from Dr. Koop before?

A.   No.

Q.   What do you think Dr. Koop meant by "taking charge of your own health"?

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  I guess he meant be courageous. Don't just be a couch potato.  Be active.  Do the right thing. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   Do you think that part of what Dr. Koop is saying when he says "take charge of your own health" is that an individual is responsible for their own health? MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  Well, I know that's how the tobacco industry would like to spin it.  I'm not sure that's how I would spin it.  I would put it, rather, the way I did, which is the importance of being courageous, knowing the truth.

But, again, it's just a slogan, "Take charge of your own health."  That could mean almost anything, right? BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   What do you mean by "be courageous"?

A.   Well, just don't sit back and be a couch potato, you know, do something, do the right thing.  I don't know.  It's a vague maxim.  It doesn't say almost anything, really.

Q.   Well, do you think what Dr. Koop meant was that individuals are responsible for their own health?

A.   That's not how I would --

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  That's not how I would spin it. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   So continuing on, it says, "He" -- that's Dr. Koop -- "says that he became convinced that a commercial Internet venture was the only way to get the word out: 'I've tried the nonprofit world, and the nonprofit world is not interested in supporting those messages on the Internet or in any other way.'" Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you understand that the messages that Dr. Koop is referring to that the nonprofit world is not interested in supporting is taking charge of your own health, and the only prescription that is more valuable is knowledge?

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form.

THE WITNESS:  I think that's over reading it.

The way -- when I first saw that, I thought he meant the government by the nonprofit world.  But maybe he meant voluntary associations. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   Do you know what "the nonprofit world" means when Dr. Koop refers to nonprofit world?

A.   Not exactly, no.  It could mean a lot of different things.

Q.   It could include the government; correct?

A.   It could.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   It could include the voluntary health organizations like the American Cancer Society or the American Lung Association?

A.   Right.  That's what I just said.

Q.   And if he meant simply government, it probably would have been easier to just say "government"; correct?

A.   Who knows.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   Is it fair to say that in some way Dr. Koop felt that his own commercial Internet venture was a way for him to get whatever he felt was important out to the

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

public?

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  Was it commercial? BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   I'm sorry?

A.   Was it commercial?  You said his own commercial venture.  I didn't know it was commercial.

Q.   You didn't know that drkoop.com was a commercial venture?

A.   Not really, no.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 2 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   I'm going to hand you what I've marked as Exhibit 2.

A.   I guess it goes on to say in the next paragraph that its emerging content, meaning the imparting of medical information and E-commerce, the selling of health-related products.

So that would make it commercial.

Q.   I'll hand you what I've marked as Exhibit 2. This is an article from the New York Times about koop.com.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, you see this is from June 13, 1999?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

A.   Right.

Q.   If you look at the second paragraph it says, "Not to worry.  Dr. Koop became an eight-figure lord of the Internet last week.  drkoop.com, his consumer health startup went public on Thursday at $9, soared to $20.25, and closed at $15.8125, valuing his 2.5 million shares at $39.5 million."

A.   Wow.

Q.   You said, "Wow"?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So you didn't know that Dr. Koop had become a dot com millionaire with the koop.com Web site?

A.   I had no idea that it was that type of commercial venture that actually sold stock and earned him $40 million, or at least that's what the stock valuation was in 1999.

Q.   If you look at the last paragraph in the article, it says, "Dr. Koop himself was understandably euphoric last week, but he cited improved public health rather than his private wealth as the reason.  'My special delight about this,' he said, 'is it provides me with an opportunity to get my message out to people -that they have to take care of their own health.'" Do you see that?

A.   Yes, I do.

Q.   And taking care of their own health, that's the same message we saw in the other article?

A.   It's another one of those throw-aways, yeah.

Q.   Why do you call it a throw-away?

A.   Well, it could mean anything.

Q.   And so what do you take it to mean in the context of this article?

A.   It means that he's happy he's made tens of millions of dollars with slogans.

Q.   Are you surprised to see that Dr. Koop made this much money from the Web site?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Why?

A.   Because I didn't know.  It's a lot of money. I didn't know that he could make that much money off of that type of Web site at that time, making him an eight-figure lord of Internet, as it says.

Q.   I'm going to hand you what we've marked as Exhibit 3.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 3 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   And this would be the About Us section of drkoop.com.

Q.   And have you ever seen other portions of drkoop.com?

A.   I'm often shown them in litigation by the defense.

Q.   In your research, have you ever looked at drkoop.com?

A.   I may have, but not very much.

Q.   When you say that you may have, is there a way to find out whether you have or have not other than your own memory?

A.   I don't think so.

Q.   To the best of your recollection sitting here today, have you ever reviewed drkoop.com as part of your research of the historical record of the tobacco companies?

A.   Well, I do see it in litigation a lot.  But I'm not sure if I've seen it outside of the litigation context.

Q.   And is the first time you ever saw the Web site in litigation?

A.   I think so.

Q.   So did that pique that curiosity of yours to go take a look at it?

A.   It probably did.

Q.   And if you look at the About Us section under

"What is drkoop.com?" it says that, "Our Web site is based on the vision of Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former U.S. Surgeon General, who believes that people should be empowered to better manage their personal health with comprehensive, trusted information.  drkoop.com strives to be the most trusted and complete source of consumer healthcare information and services on the Internet." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And do you know of any other Web sites at the time of drkoop.com that were offering similar medical information?

A.   I'm sure there were lots, but I haven't looked at that.

Q.   Now, when Dr. Koop was the Surgeon General of the United States, other than overseeing the management of the Surgeon General reports, what were some of his other duties?

A.   Well, he was head of the Public Health Service, so I'm sure he gave a lot of speeches.  You know, he was the top doctor for the United States government, so I'm sure he had all kinds of bureaucratic and ceremonial duties.

Q.   Have you ever had a chance to review any of Dr. Koop's speeches?

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 4 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   I'm going to hand you what I'm marking as Exhibit 4.  I really like these preprinted stickers.

You will see on the front, this is a speech that Dr. Koop gave to the Minnesota Coalition for a Smoke-Free Society 2000 on March 14, 1985.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Have you ever had the chance to review this speech before?

A.   I'm not sure.

Q.   I'll give you a chance to review it if you like, but I'd like to talk about Page 17, if we could.

A.   Okay.

Q.   So the first paragraph reads, "Please remember that the act of smoking is not mandated by law nor is it part of some grand strategy to win a war. It's a personal, voluntary act.  You may choose to smoke or you may choose not to.  The decision is strictly up to you."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And this is a speech Dr. Koop gave while he was the Surgeon General of the United States?

A.   Right.

Q.   Take a look at one more.  I'll show you what I have marked as Exhibit 5.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 5 was marked for identification.)

THE WITNESS:  He also says, just to finish that thought off, "To know the science and to know the etiquette and to know the law is all very well and all very necessary.  But the consumer can never be really educated about the risks of smoking until he or she becomes familiar with the power, the influence, and the economics of the cigarette industry itself."

That seems to be true. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   What page are you reading from?

A.   That's from the next page, Page 18.

Q.   So you agree with that sentiment by Dr. Koop?

A.   Yeah.  It shows how little people really know about cigarettes, because people don't know the power, the influence, and the economics of the cigarette industry itself.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=28
Page 29

Q.   Do you agree with the portion that I read earlier from Dr. Koop?

A.   I think that's another one of those throw-away things that doesn't mean almost anything. It's also not consistent with his own endorsement of the 1988 report on addiction, because the whole point of that '88 report is to say that smoking is not simply a matter of free choice; it's also a matter of compulsion for people who are addicted.

Q.   So do you think Dr. Koop was wrong when he wrote this paragraph?

A.   I think it's just one of those vague throw-away lines.

Q.   Why do you think it's a throw-away line?

A.   Because you may choose to smoke or you may choose not to, as he says.  That could mean anything. This don't say anything.

Q.   Is it true that a person can choose to smoke or choose not to smoke?

A.   It just doesn't mean anything.  It's almost meaningless because it doesn't capture the fact that most people who smoke are addicted, and which means that their choice is violated, that it's not like choosing, you know, whether to drink Coke or Pepsi.

Q.   Do you think Dr. Koop at the time that he

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=29
Page 30

gave this speech was unaware of the fact that cigarette smoking can be addictive?

A.   It's a good question.  He may not have realized the significance of addiction.  I think there is another speech that I've seen from '82 where he does talk about the importance of addiction.

Remember, when people use the language of choice, especially someone like Koop, they're really trying to encourage people to quit.  They really giving advice and encouragement and empowerment.  So it's inspirational and not just descriptive.  You see what I mean?

And that's a problem with a lot of public health rhetoric is it's often inspirational and motivational and not necessarily just describing the facts.

Q.   And so you would describe this paragraph on the first part of 17 as inspirational?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Does that mean it's not true?

A.   Well, I mean, the force of it is to motivate, so it has a different sort of rhetorical function. Rather than simply having a truth value, it really means that he's trying to motivate the audience.

And, remember, it's the sentence just before

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

that where he says, "Please remember that the act of smoking is not mandated by law nor is it part of some grand strategy to win a war."  And so he's really trying to denaturalize the smoking act, to deconstruct it, to empower the listener or the smoker that it is possible to quit, things like that.  So it's a motivational, inspirational speech.

Q.   So when Dr. Koop says something like this, what he's telling the smoker is that it is possible for you to quit?

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  Well, he's actually not talking to smokers.  He's talking to the Minnesota Coalition for a Smoke-Free Society by the year 2000.  So he's speaking to political activists, and he's trying to jazz them up. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   And presumably the members of the Minnesota Coalition for a Smoke-Free Society didn't include very many smokers?

A.   I would be surprised if there were any.

Q.   So why would Dr. Koop be needing to give motivational speeches to individuals who are not smokers about the ability to quit or the choice as it relates to smoking?

A.   Because activists are always trying to gear

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

themselves up and others up and sort of -- that's what movement politics is all about is kind of getting a spirit in the room.  So I think that's what he's trying to do.

Q.   So when Dr. Koop makes a statement like this, do you think that he believes it?

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know.  I assume he does . BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   Do you know if Dr. Koop was in the business of going around and giving speeches,   telling groups of people things that he didn't believe in?

A.   I don't know.

Q.   Why do you think he would have given this speech and said these things if he didn't believe them?

A.   I don't know.  You tell me.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   I want to look at the other speech I've handed you.  This is from a speech that Dr. Koop gave to the University of South Florida School of Medicine on March 18, 1987.

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So this is two years after the speech we just looked at?

A.   Right.

Q.   I want to look -- again, you can take your time and peruse if you'd like, but I want to take a look at Page 3 first.

A.   Okay.

Q.   So Dr. Koop says --

A.   I see it's on the same typewriter.

Q.   As the last speech?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is that relevant?

A.   No.

Q.   So on Page 3 it says, "Here in Florida, you've been doing an outstanding job.  I'm thinking in particular of the ...

"'Freedom from Smoking' clinics ... "Your work with physicians, especially those taking care of pregnant women ...

"And, of course, your work at the state and local levels, bringing the anti-smoking message into the schools of Florida."

A.   Right.

Q.   Do you see that?

Now, what are Freedom From Smoking clinics?

A.   I don't really know much about those.  I assume they're like quit smoking clinics that you see from time to time.

Q.   And do you know what Florida was doing to bring the antismoking message into the schools of Florida at that time?

A.   Not much know, no.

Q.   What do you know?

A.   Well, I know that from time to time textbooks have included admonitions against smoking for children of all ages, that the message that kids shouldn't smoke was not unusual going back decades.  But I know this is before the big infusion of money that would come from the Florida tobacco settlement, so it can't be done at anything like the scale it would be done after the year 2000.

Q.   At the time of this speech, Dr. Koop, at least, felt that in Florida, state and local governments were getting the antismoking message into the schools of Florida?

A.   Well, he mentions that they're trying to.

Q.   And you haven't done any research to say one way or the other whether they were or were not?

A.   Well, I'm sure they were to some extent.

Q.   You just don't know the extent of the message

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

that was getting to those schools?

A.   Right.

Q.   You're not disagreeing that it was happening?

A.   Oh, I'm sure it was happening to some degree. People have been worried about smoking for a long time.

Q.   If you turn to Page 4, the next paragraph reeds, "Frankly I'm very impressed with the efforts in this state.  Virtually everywhere you turn -- Tampa, Miami, Fort Myer, Jacksonville, Sarasota -- there's a strong program of some kind that is helping smokers quit and helping nonsmokers to stay that way." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you have any reason to disagree with that statement from Dr. Koop?

A.   Again, it's aspirational.  It's inspirational.  It's interesting that it's ten years before the peak youth prevalence of smoking among ages 12 to 17, nationally at least.  And so there's a bit of chest beating going on here.  He's trying to be encouraging and flattering.  So, you know, these are his opinions.

Q.   So my question was:  Do you have any information to disagree with the statement from Dr. Koop?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 36

A.   Well, I mentioned one example where it's not very impressive that the youth smoking is still very high at this point.  So it's -- I don't think it's anything to brag about.

Q.   And this paragraph that we just read on the top of Page 4 talks about the things that Florida is doing to help smokers quit; correct?

A.   Well, he doesn't go into much detail.

Q.   But to be fair, he says there is a strong program of some kind that is helping smokers quit everywhere you turn?

A.   Sure.  That could mean almost anything.

Q.   Do you take it to mean there was a strong program in the cities that he mentioned that was helping people quit smoking?

A.   I don't know one way or the other.

Q.   You can't just tell from the reading of the paragraph?

A.   No.  No.  Again, he's trying to be flattering to this group at the University of South Florida.

Q.   And it's not just Florida he's talking about. If you look at the next paragraph he says, "As a result of this kind of response all across the country, I am convinced that most Americans have come to truly understand the significance of the antismoking

campaign."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  Well, that could mean almost anything.

Q.   So do you disagree with that statement by Dr. Koop?

A.   I just think it's so vague you can't agree or disagree with it.

Q.   Do you disagree that Dr. Koop said it?

A.   How could I disagree that he said it?

Q.   So when Dr. Koop says that he as the Surgeon General of the United States is convinced that Americans have come to understand the significance of the antismoking campaign, you don't know what he meant by that?

A.   I do know what he meant by that.  I just mean that -- understand it as an inspirational kind of:  Hey guys, we're doing a great job, kind of thing.  It's sort of empty rhetoric, I would say.

Q.   And do you disagree with Dr. Koop when he says that most Americans at this time have come to understand the significance of the antismoking campaign?

A.   Yeah.  I don't think people even today know the significance of the antismoking campaign.  I mean, that's a very general statement.

Q.   If you turn to Page 5, it goes on to say,

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

"And I want to emphasize those key words -- 'preventable burden of smoking-related illness and death' -- for two very good reasons:

"First, smoking is a personal choice.  No one is required to smoke.  In fact, anyone can -- and should -- choose not to smoke as the first and most important act of personal preventive health care." Did I read that correctly?

A.   Pretty close.  I guess he's referencing the previous paragraph, "In its simplest terms, the achievement of a smoke-free society will insure that we will have rescued the people of American from the preventable burden of smoking-related illness and death ... a burden they have been carrying far too long at a far too heavy a price."

So that's what he's referencing.

Q.   And, again, he says, "First, smoking is a personal choice -- no one is required to smoke." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And that's similar to the sentiment we saw in the speech from 1985; correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   And that phrase, "Smoking is a personal choice," actually appears in several Surgeon General's

reports that were authored under Dr. Koop; correct?

A.   Well, unfortunately, it does.  But the more important fact is that the 1988 Surgeon General's Report makes it clear that smoking is not simply a personal choice.  So there's some inconsistency here.

Q.   When did the 1988 Surgeon General's Report come out?

A.   I think it was in May of that year, of '88.

Q.   And you've been involved in the process of drafting Surgeon General's reports, correct -- or reviewing --

A.   Only once.

Q.   And so does that process take simply a year, or is it a longer process?

A.   I think most of them are more than a year. Some of them may have been less than a year.

Q. So by March of 1987, do you think that Dr. Koop was already working on the 1988 Surgeon General's Report?

A.   That's a good question.  It presumably is right about when it got going.  I don't know the exact month.

Q.   Do you disagree with the idea that Dr. Koop says, that smoking is a personal choice?

A.   Yeah.  I don't think that's correct.  That

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

sounds more like tobacco industry propaganda.

Q.   Well, actually, it's coming from Dr. Koop; correct?

A.   Unfortunately, that's how the world works.

Q.   Your understanding is that you think the tobacco companies somehow influenced Dr. Koop to write this speech in 1987?

A.   Well, not directly.  But, of course, they created much of the entire culture of cigarettes and our concepts of choice and things like that.  So I think, of course, they influenced Koop.  I mean, much of his work was devoted to fighting that influence, but I'm sure he's also partly captured by that influence as well.  So it would be a complicated story.

Q.   When Dr. Koop was a Surgeon General of the United States, was there a bigger opponent of the tobacco industry than Dr. Koop himself?

A.   It's hard to define "bigger" because the metrics of size there are a little unclear.  He's certainly one of the more vocal critics.  That may be a safer way to say it.

Q. Would you say that Dr. Koop was probably the most vocal critic of the tobacco industry while he was the Surgeon General?

A.   He was certainly one of them.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 41

Q.   Do you think he is probably -- whether he was the most vocal or not -- was he probably the most well known critic of the tobacco industry at the time?

A.   Certainly one of the critics, yes.

Q.   Who else would have been in the mix of the most vocal or --

A.   Well, there have been so many, depending on which decade.  But Maurine Neuberger is very powerful in the '60s.  Then you have Stan Glantz in the 1980s. There are different people at different positions.

But I guess in terms of the media attention and prominence, Koop would certainly have been one of the more powerful critics.

Q.   He was no friend of the tobacco industry?

A.   No, no.  I don't think so.

Q.   Keep going and look at Page 11.  Dr. Koop had some things to say about the warning labels.

Now, in 1987, the new set of four rotating warnings that were put out in 1985 would have been on the packs of cigarettes; correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And so Dr. Koop in talking about the warnings says, "There's nothing fancy about these warnings. They're in the same plain English that any family physician would use -- and should use -- with a patient

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

who smokes.  And there's nothing vague about them either."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And do you agree with those statements?

A.   No.

Q.   Why not?

A. Well, they are vague, I think. "Contains carbon monoxide," how many people know what carbon monoxide is? They're plain -- he's right in the sense that there's nothing fancy about them, but that's part of the problem. Since they weren't fancy, they -- you know, they're not something a lot of people paid a lot of attention to.

So he's, again, being aspirational, inspirational.  He's saying, you know, pay attention to the warnings.  He's ginning them up and saying, you know, we need more of the same.  And he's sort of saying that the warnings are something like the kind of duty an ordinary physician could give, the kind of advice that a physician could give.  And he's speaking to physicians, I think.

Q.   You keep saying that these statements that we've been reading from Dr. Koop are aspirational.

Are you in any way trying to say that they're

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

untrue?

A.   Well, I'm saying you don't want to exaggerate their truthful nature.  I know you're interested in picking them out and showing them to a jury because it fulfills the industry's assumption of risk defense and makes it look like smoking is a personal choice.  And we even have Dr. Koop saying that.  I know that's why you like them.

But I'm saying that it's a little cheesy to do that.

Q.   Is it not true that Dr. Koop said that smoking was a personal choice?

A.   Oh, yeah.  We've got several examples of him saying it.

Q.   And at the time Dr. Koop was the Surgeon General of the United States; correct?

A.   Right.  But he also said the exact opposite in his more important report than these little speeches. In his more important report, namely the 1988 report on nicotine addiction, he makes it very clear that it's wrong to say that smoking is simply a personal choice, and that the two main reasons, actually, had already been said in, I think, the 1981 Surgeon General's Report where -- I forget the exact date -- but where it says that there's two main reasons that it's not simply a

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

personal choice, namely, the age at which people start, because they do start before their age of maturity, and the fact of addiction, that those compromise personal choice.

So just to run through his little speeches and pick out little sound bites where he says "smoking is a personal choice," that's the thing I don't think is fair.

Q.   Do you think that Dr. Koop didn't feel that smokers had the choice to quit or not smoke?

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form.

THE WITNESS:  Well, he certainly feels that enough to say it in speeches.  But he, again, is being aspirational.  He doesn't want to say, "You're a robot." In fact, I think he has very phrases like that.  Usually the one you guys pick out is where he says, "No one is going to -- a cigarette doesn't jump into your mouth and light itself."  That's the one you guys usually like the most.

But the more important fact is that nicotine addiction compromises personal choice.  So it's a little unfair to pick out these little items which are really used in an inspirational context. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   Do you think by 1987 Dr. Koop was aware of

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=44
Page 45

the fact that cigarette smoking could be additive?

A.   I think so.  Yeah, there's actually an earlier report -- I think from '82 or so -- where he mentions that.  Not a Surgeon General's report, but some type of meeting or publication he was involved in.

Q.   If you look at the Page 12 where Dr. Koop is talking about the fourth warning, he says, "The fourth warning says that, '... quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious health risks.'  This is a tough one, because we know that nicotine is probably the most addictive drug in our society." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  So it's sort of going against a little bit of the personal choice rhetoric he uses earlier.

Q. If you look at the very next sentence, "Still, smokers must try, because, as this label implies, it's never too late to quit."

A.   Right.

Q.   So when he says that "smokers must try," he means smokers must try to quit smoking?

A.   Of course.  Yes.  Again, he's being motivational.

Q.   So Dr. Koop certainly was aware of the fact that cigarette smoking could be addictive when he wrote these statements that we've been reviewing since he

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

specifically says, "Nicotine is the most addictive drug in our society"?

A.   I think so, yeah.

Q.   And despite what he knew about addiction, despite even mentioning the fact that nicotine is addictive in his speech, he still also felt it was important to say that smoking is a personal choice?

A.   Right.  Yes, that's what he says.  He's got all the cliches in there.  And, again, he's being aspirational.

Q.   I want to switch topics.

Are you aware of a U.S. Department of Agriculture program that they ran through the Bureau of Plant Industry in the early 1900s to look at ways to grow tobacco?

A.   A federal program?

Q.   Correct.

A.   I know that the federal government was involved in agricultural promotion of tobacco growing going back even into the 1800s, but I don't know which particular program you're referencing.

Exhibit 6.  You can see this is a bulletin from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Bureau of Plaint Industry?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You can see it actually looks like it was digitized at the Stanford Library?

A.   Right.

Q.   If you will turn to Page 61 of the actual document, the fourth page of the PDF?

A.   Okay.

Q.   So you will see that the bulletin is entitled "A New Method for the Determination of Nicotine in Tobacco"?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I want to look at the footnote, the beginning of Footnote A.  It says, "In the Tobacco Breeding Investigations conducted by the Bureau of Plant Industry careful experiments have been undertaken to determine the relation of the nicotine content of cigar filler and wrapper tobacco to the quality of these tobaccos." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So what do you know about the federal government's tobacco breeding investigations that were conducted by the Bureau of Plant Industry?

A.   I don't know much except for the fact that

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

there was a promotion of tobacco by the federal government in the same sense as they supported corn or soybeans or cotton or any other agricultural product.

Q.   In your research, have you ever come across this tobacco breeding investigation program before?

A.   I've seen mention of it, but I haven't studied it.

Q.   I want to look at a later bulletin from the same program.  I'll hand you what I've marked as Exhibit 7.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 7 was marked for identification.)

THE WITNESS:  Okay. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   So this is, again, from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Bureau of Plant Industry.  It's from 1909.

A.   Right.

Q.   Bulletin Number 141?

A.   Right.

Q.   I want to look at the paper entitled "The Relation of Nicotine to the Quality of Tobacco."  If you look at the second paragraph, it starts with, "The amount of nicotine contained in tobacco from different sources is subject to very wide variations, some samples

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

containing less than 1 percent, while others contain more than 5 percent."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  That's the variation.

Q.   And what do you mean by "the variation"?

A.   Well, different tobacco species have different levels of nicotine.

Q.   So different tobacco plants actually come with a different amount of nicotine from other tobacco plants?

A.   Yeah.  It can differ by the, you know, height on the plant, on the stalk.  It differs according to how you plant them.  Different species of tobacco have different levels of nicotine.  And how you fertilize them affects the nicotine content, as does sunlight, rainfall, irrigation, all kinds of things. So there is variation.

Q.   If you look at Page 6, the next page, I want to talk a little bit about that variation.  About halfway down that first paragraph on Page 6, it starts with, "As has been stated in a previous publication of this Department, there is every reason to believe that by systemic breeding it is practicable to procure strains of the important types of tobacco characterized by a high or a low nicotine content, provided the

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

external conditions with reference to soils, fertilizers, and cultural methods are properly controlled."

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you see that they're talking about it's possible to breed tobacco with either high nicotine content or low nicotine content?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is this something that the federal government has been studying at the time?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And this is something that the federal government continues to study throughout the years?

A.   Yeah.  I don't know how much they're doing it recently.  They're probably not as heavily involved in the nicotine business since the '90s.  But for many decades, the USDA was involved in promoting tobacco, as were the state agricultural boards of the different tobacco-growing states.

Q.   So at least by the time of this publication, and probably much earlier, it wasn't a secret that different types of tobacco had different content of nicotine?

A.   Exactly.  Yeah, that's well known in the 1800s.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=50
Page 51

Q.   And it wasn't a secret that people could breed tobacco plants with a certain amount of nicotine?

A.   That's correct.  Yeah, or at least you could manipulate it in different ways.  You can just choose the different varieties.  You don't even have to breed them.

Q.   If you turn to Page 9 for me, changing to a little different topic.  The second paragraph on Page 9 starts with, "Nicotine, though quite volatile in the free state, is strongly basic in forms comparatively stable salts with acid which are not readily volatile." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so that's talking about -- I think you testified in the past about nicotine being a free state?

A.   I think that is talking about that, and because they are talking about the acid base balance.

Q.   So as early as 1909, the U.S. government was aware of the fact that nicotine could be in a free state in tobacco?

A. Well, you say the U.S. government was aware. What you really mean is this one guy was writing about it.

Q. So the U.S. Department of Agriculture Bureau of Plant Industry was aware of the fact that nicotine

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

contained in tobacco could be in a free state?

A.   Yes.  This particular guy, Wightman --

Q.   If you look a little further --

A.   -- Garner.

Q.   If you look a further down in the third paragraph before the new subheading, second sentence, it says, "In other words, it appears that a portion of the nicotine contained in tobacco is present in practically a free state."

Do you see that?

A.   Is that also on Page 9?

Q.   Yes.

A.   Yeah.  It's talking about that acid base balance, and is talking about the nicotine either being bound in the form of a salt or free.  Yeah, it's basic acid base chemistry.

Q.   If you actually look at Page 12, there is a Table 11 that shows they were actually doing some studies of the total amount of nicotine and what portion of that nicotine was quote, "free nicotine"?

A.   On Page 11?

Q.   Page 12.  Table � I think it's Table II.

A.   Yeah.  This is the table on nicotine soluble in petroleum ether in domestic filler tobacco before and after the addition of citric acid.

Q.   So they were actually able to measure the amount of free nicotine that was in the tobacco that they were testing?

A.   Apparently, though I have to look at this a little more to make sure that the word "free" is being used in the way we usually think of.

Q.   And when you say "the way we usually think of," what do you mean?

A.   Well, free base nicotine.  Nicotine in the free, non-salt state.  It probably is because that's why you would distinguish it according to whether it's soluble in petroleum ether.  So I think that's probably correct.

Q.   Do you know how long this program lasted at the U.S. Department of Agriculture Bureau of Plant Industry?

A.   I don't.

Q.   You've never done any research into that?

A.   No.  Again, the leader seems to be Wightman W. Garner, Scientific Assistant, Tobacco Investigations at the USDA's Bureau of Plant Industry.  This is from their Bulletin Number 141.

Q.   Are you familiar with Mr. Garner?

A.   Not very, no.

Q.   I'm going to switch topics again.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 9 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   I'll hand you what we've marked as Exhibit 8 and Exhibit 9.  I know you've seen these before.

A.   Yes.

Q.   These are a series of cables from July 3, 1963; correct?

A.   Right.  From Addison Yeaman at Brown & Williamson to Anthony McCormick at BAT, the mother ship in England.

Q.   And I think that you often show the jury the telegram from Yeaman to McCormick from July 3rd; correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What we've marked as Exhibit 8?

A.   That's right.

Q.   I want to talk about this Exhibit 9.  This is actually a telegram from McCormick to Yeaman; correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It says that, "TRC consultant scientists advise it is too early to submit Battelle reports to the Surgeon General's committee, but we think they will

agree that continuation by Battelle of this work would be useful."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Have you ever had a chance to review any documentation from those TRC consultant scientists?

A.   I've seen some of their papers, yes.

Q.   I'll hand you what we'll mark as Exhibit 10. (Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 10 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   And my first question is:  Do you have any reason to dispute that the TRC consultant scientists felt the Battelle reports were too early to submit to the Surgeon General's committee?

A.   Well, that could mean almost anything.  In other words, why did they not want to submit them?  They hadn't been published.  In other words, you could imagine different reasons for why they might think that or not think that.

Q.   Do you know any reasons why the TRC consultants felt it was too early to submit the Battelle reports?

A.   Not really, no.

Q.   Okay.  If you look at what we've marked as

Exhibit 10, you will see this is entitled "Appraisal of Reports on Project Hippo I and Project Hippo II." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   If you turn to the last page, you will see it's from June 21, 1963.

A.   Mine doesn't have that on the last page.

Q.   If you don't mind, you can look at mine. We'll swap out the copy with the right version.  We can look together.

A.   Yes.

Q.   You will see at the very bottom it says June 1963?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It's actually got the day first, the British style?

A.   Right.

Q.   If you can take a look at the Final Comments section, the very last sentence reads, "The information of these reports is not sufficiently complete to justify any form of publication." Do you see that?

A.   Right.

Q.   Do you have any reason to dispute that the TRC felt that it was too early to submit those reports

for publication?

A.   No.  But, again, it's vague.  I don't think they ever submitted that stuff for publication.  So it's a little unclear what that means.  In other words, there could be different rationales for that.

But the aerial project that they're referencing was ongoing, and they weren't finished.  In fact, they did continue with the Battelle work.

Q.   Have you ever seen this exhibit that we marked as Exhibit 10 before?

A.   Oh, yes, I have.

Q.   And if you reviewed it in the past, do you know why it says that the TRC felt that it was too early to publish the reports?

A.   Well, no, because of the ambiguities that I mentioned.  The project was ongoing, and so they did keep on with it.  The aerial patent is not until a couple of years later.

So I think there may have been multiple reasons they didn't want to give it to the Surgeon General, one of which was the legal reason.  But I don't think they wanted to let the Surgeon General know everything they were doing with respect to cigarettes --

Q.   If you look --

A.   -- especially the kind of addiction work that

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

was implied in the Battelle Hippo project.

Q.   If you look under General Comments on the first page, the second line says, "The data in these reports have been poorly presented by any standards and even for the non-critical and non-technical reader there is so little data that the experiments are in some cases impossible to follow."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you have any reason to dispute that comment by the TRC consultants?

A.   Well, again, it's a little unclear.  It's just that these particular people preparing this report weren't satisfied that the data that they were looking at was complete.

Q.   We have been going about an hour.  Do you want to take a break?

A.   It's fine with me.  It's up to you.  I can keep going.

Q.   Dr. Proctor, I'll hand you what I've marked as Exhibit 11.  This is a Time magazine from April 1960. Have you seen this before?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you see that R. J. Reynolds' Bowman Gray is on the cover?

A.   Yes, it is, with a cigarette and a big smile.

Q.   I want to talk about a couple quotes from Page 110.  They're actually already highlighted.  You will see it included a cigarette ad that appeared in this issue.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Mostly because I pulled this from Dr. Cummings' reliance list.

A.   Okay.

Q.   If you look at Page 110, I want to talk about this first quote from the middle of the second column starting, "It has spent $3,700,000 to set up the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which is widely regarded as only a smokescreen for the industry." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so at the time in 1960, is it true that people felt that the TIRC was only a smokescreen for the industry?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

A.   I think some people felt that.  It's hard to say how widely that was understood.

Q.   The next --

A.   I haven't seen very many examples of people saying that, so I think it's not very common.

Q.   But to be fair, this quote did appear in Time magazine in 1960?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And this was one of the popular weekly magazines in its time?

A.   It is.

Q.   So the next thing I want to talk about is this quote from the comedian Joe Lewis, the first paragraph of the third column.  It says, "Their attitude was summed up by comedian Joe E. Lewis, who said that he had become so nervous from reading stories about cigarettes and health that he decided to give up reading."

A.   Yes.

Q.   Have you seen that quote before?

A.   I've seen similar ones.  It's parallel to the jokes cigarette makers would say that "Smoking is the leading cause of statistics."

So there's a period where you're starting to get a lot of jokes about cigarettes.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 61

Q.   And part of this joke from Mr. Lewis is that there's so much information about cigarettes and health that he basically had to gave up reading to stop seeing them?

A.   Well, that's not the way I would put it. It's the opposite.  It's that he's not going to give up smoking, he's going to give up reading.  So he's trivializing the harm and really says he's not going to quit, he's going to give up reading.

Q.   Part of the joke is that there's so much information, he has to give up reading rather than give up smoking; right?

A.   Yeah, that's part of it.  But there's another important part, which is his trivialization of the whole thing in the same way that the joke "Cigarettes are the leading cause of statistics" also trivializes the harm.

Q.   But to be in on the joke, right, you also have to understand that there is a wealth of information that is available for people to read about the dangers of smoking, otherwise, the joke doesn't make much sense; right?

A.   Well, that's partly true.  But the whole point is that even though there's a wealth, it's not important, that really, reading is a greater threat than smoking.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=61
Page 62

Q.   And so if someone hears that joke, do they have to know that there's information available or that there are things in the paper, in the local news about the dangers of smoking to get the joke?

A.   That's a hard question to say.  That's a hard question to answer.  They'd have to -- it's a little bit of a sophisticated joke, right?  They're playing with word switching.

But, again, it's very similar to the "Smoking is the leading cause of statistics."  That's not funny unless you've heard that smoking is the leading cause of cancer.  So I think that's true.  That's partly what you said is true.  But the thrust of the joke is to make fun of the facts.

Q.   So the last section I want to talk about is this third highlighted section.  It says, "Most companies also use reconstituted or homogenized tobacco (formerly unusable stems and leaves that are pulverized and re-pressed), which was pioneered by Reynolds and copied by the industry."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   "The average filter cigarette now contains about 14 percent reconstituted tobacco.  Many tobacco men feel that filters, because they have less flavor and

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

often burn faster, actually make people smoke more." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So first of all, this article is talking about reconstituted tobacco; right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so this is an example of the popular press talking about the fact that cigarettes contained reconstituted tobacco?

A.   It is.

Q.   And the second half talks about compensation?

A.   Right.  Yeah.

Q.   And so in this popular magazine, it actually says that tobacco companies feel that people actually smoke more with filters; right?

A.   Well, yeah, it's not really compensation because of addiction, it's compensation just because they want to get more tobacco.  They feel they're not getting enough tobacco, so they smoke more cigarettes. And I think that was going on at the time.  People were smoking more and more cigarettes.

But, again, it's not compensation for nicotine; it's compensation for flavor and just less tobacco.

Q.   So how do you distinguish whether someone is

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=63
Page 64

smoking or compensating for flavor versus compensating for nicotine?

A.   Well, I guess it would be the difference between a choice and a compulsion.  So, you know, if I am getting a water bottle and it's only got a little water in it, I might get two bottles of water, just to get more water.  That's just a choice.  Compensation in the relevant sense for nicotine addiction is a kind of compulsion, that if you felt compelled that you had to use more water or use more cigarettes.

So there's a difference in the source of the behavior to smoke more.  This is just saying that -- I mean, it's not saying much, but it's saying that as a result of insufficient flavor, people are smoking more. The later work on nicotine addiction would emphasize that people are titrating and keeping a constant level of nicotine in their blood, and that's why they may smoke more or less according to what type of cigarettes they're using.

So there is a difference between voluntary, you know, getting a certain amount.  If your wife says, "Get a pound of tomatoes," and it comes in half-pound packs, you will get two packs.  But that's not because you're compelled to get a certain amount, it's just that you want more.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=64
Page 65

Q.   And so are there individuals who may, when they switch to filters smoke more, not because of an addiction, but because simply they wanted more flavor from their cigarettes?

A.   Well, that -- anything is possible, right? Anything is possible.  It does depend on whether you're addicted and if -- it can be a value thing.  You might, you know, smoke more because you want to use up more of your cigarette.  I think poor people often do this. They'11 smoke their cigarettes further because they want -- they don't want to spend as much money on cigarettes.

So there's lots of reasons for how people adjust their behavior.

Q.   And how do you determine on an individual level whether someone is smoking more because they're seeking more out of their cigarette from a flavor perspective versus smoking more because they want more nicotine because of their addiction?

A.   Well, I don't really do that on an individual basis.  I do it more on a scientific basis or statistical basis, is how I would do it.

Q.   Have you seen statistics about the difference?

A.   Well, there are statistics about what

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=65
Page 66

proportion of people who smoke are addicted.  That would be the key bottom line.  So if most people are addicted, then most people will compensate, in other words, titrate.  That's the simplest way to think of it.

Q. And have you come across smokers that are aware of the fact that when they switch to either a filter or a low tar or a light cigarette, that they actually smoke more?

A.   Well, you see, you know, in the archives and people talking about it, you see that from time to time. And some people do understand that.  Some people notice that they're smoking more.  Historically in the '60s and '70s they're smoking a few more cigarettes per day on average.

On the other hand, we know that there's some documents which point out that a lot of people don't realize that they're smoking more.  They actually think they're cutting down when they're actually smoking more. (Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 12 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   I'll hand you what we'll mark as Exhibit 12, from the British Journal of Inebriety (Alcoholism and Drug Addiction).

A.   Yes.  It's from 1935.  It's titled "What is

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Addiction" by E. W. Adams.

Q.   And can you tell me -- before you look at the article -- in the 1930s what was the general understanding of what the term "addiction" meant?

A.   It's kind of an interim period when you're shifting from the older notion of addiction as a kind of unhealthy devotion, kind of a moralistic failure.  It's sort of an in-between period between that and the period when people start quitting, and therefore, are starting to discover that nicotine is the reason that people smoke and that it's powerfully addictive.

So I don't think there's a lot of linkage between nicotine and addiction in the 1930s.  The more common focus was opium, heroin, morphine, and to some extent, alcohol.  So that's a sort of short, thumbnail version.

Even in the 1950s, addiction is mainly something that's caused by a failure in your own mind and body, that there's something wrong with you that leads you to become a wino or a junkie or a degenerate. And it's only a little bit later that you get addiction as being a more medical condition that even upstanding people can succumb to and even animals can succumb to.

So that's a short sketch, but there are exceptions to everything out there.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Q.   Let's talk about Mr. Adams' definition.  And I want to give you a chance to look at this, but to shortcut it, he basically has five cardinal points of addiction.  If you look at Page 5, we can go through those five.

So the first, if you look at Page 3 is the "masterfulness," he calls it, of addiction. Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so when he says "masterful," do you know what he means?

A.   Well, it looks like he's talking about the addictive potency of the drug.  That's what I'm assuming.  He's talking about the extent to which it can master you, the user.

Q.   And was this idea of certain drugs being more potent than other drugs a common belief at this time?

A.   Well, certainly people understood that different drugs could be more or less potent.

Q.   And it's true today that certain drugs can be more addictive than other drugs; right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Then the second feature that he has is this idea of euphoria?

A.   Yes.  What he calls the determining motive of

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=68
Page 69

shelter from reality, a kind of the escape idea.

Q.   And by "euphoria," he may also mean what we come to think of as intoxication?

A.   I think that's correct.

Q.   And so the third, if you look under The Test of Motive, he says the third feature is craving?

A.   Yes.  What he calls an imperious need or craving??

Q.   And then the fourth is the idea of tolerance?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Then the fifth, he has this idea of the abstinence syndrome, which I think is withdrawal.

A.   Yes.

Q.   If you look under the section labeled "Tolerance, the Abstinence Syndrome, and Relapse," he says, "A second feature is what is termed the 'abstinence syndrome,' or the occurrence, on the withdrawal of the drug."

Do you see that?

Is that on the next page?

It's on Page 5 above The Five Cardinal

A

Q

Points A

Q A

Okay.  Yes.

And in the last he has relapse?

Right.

pgNbr=69
Page 70

Q.   And craving, withdrawal, tolerance and relapse, those are all hallmarks of addiction that people still look for today when they're looking about whether determining someone is or is not addicted?

A.   That's true.

Q.   Would you say this is a probably good understanding of addiction at the time?

A.   It probably is.  I would have to look a little more into it but --

Q.   Are you surprised to see the idea of craving, withdrawal, tolerance and relapse in a definition of addiction in the 1930s?

A.   Not really.  Again, this is from the British Journal of Inebriety.  And I don't know much about that, but I assume it's part of kind of a temperance movement, radical, you know, antidrug movement, and you do find a lot of these kinds of ideas in these radical antidrug societies.  It's kind of similar to Lennox Johnston in Britain.

Q.   If you look later on, he goes through several -- what he calls "doubtful cases of addiction"?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It's on Page 8.  You will see he says, "Some Doubtful Cases.  Is Tobacco Smoking an Addiction?"

Q.   So he's trying to answer the question whether tobacco smoking is a true addiction; right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   He says, "Is tobacco smoking an addiction or not?  Tobacco is a narcotic.  We know from the difference between our experiences after our first and succeeding smokes that tolerance can become established, craving is not uncommon, withdrawal may be distressing, and relapse is frequent"; right?

A.   Right.

Q.   And that's all true; right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Even today, you go through tolerance, craving, withdrawal, and relapse?

A.   Right.

Q.   Many of them?

A.   Right.  He goes on to say, "A person who regularly takes morphine, heroin or cocaine may, without exception, be described as an addict to these drugs.  No one can habitually take any of them without the drug becoming his master.  This is not the case with tobacco."

Q.   And I want to talk about that quote.

So is it true that most people who use morphine, heroin, and cocaine become addicted to those

drugs?

A.   I don't know, because some of those are used occasionally.  I just don't know the literature.  I think if you rephrased your question:  Do most of the people who use them regularly become addicted?  I would think yes.  But since they're illegal, hard to obtain, I think more people use them occasionally.  So that -- in other words, it's not just the potency of the drug but the frequency of the use that determines whether any one individual is addicted.

Obviously if you smoke one cigarette, you're not addicted.  If you do cocaine once, you're not addicted.

Q.   I mean, let's talk about those specifically. So heroin, are there many occasional heroin users?

A.   I don't know.  I think by comparison with cigarettes or beer, yes, but I don't know the actual distribution there.  I think there are probably some occasional heroin users.

Q. And when he said that, "No one can habitually take any of them without the drug becoming his master," do you agree with that statement --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- that anyone that habitually uses cocaine,

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

morphine or heroin becomes addicted?

A.   That sounds plausible, that most people who use them habitually, routinely, regularly will become addicted, which, of course, is true with tobacco as well.  But he doesn't realize that.  He says, "This is not the case with tobacco."

Q.   And so he goes on to say that, "At the one end of the scale we have the very moderate smoker who has the habit well under control, who never exceeds a certain amount, and whose liking for tobacco would be absurd to describe as a craving.  If he became convinced either by his doctor or from his own observation that the habit is doing him harm, he can and does give it up, almost without a pang, and he does not relapse.  He has no real withdrawal symptoms, merely perhaps a slight regret for the absence of an accustomed luxury, and this soon passes."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  That's that sort of notion from this era that moderate smoking really can't be addictive. And it's linked to the notion that he and others around this time are really thinking of it in terms of a psychopathology.  And so since there's not the same kind of narcosis with tobacco and you're still able to work, you can smoke regularly and not be addicted, so as long

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

as you don't do it in excess or immoderately.

And that's pretty common even into the 1950s, that there's nothing wrong with moderate smoking; it's the excessive smoking that leads you into addiction.

Q.   Now, to be fair, he's also talking specifically about the criteria of addiction that you talked about earlier; right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so are there smokers who can give up smoking without suffering from withdrawal or cravings?

A.   I think there are some.

Q.   And so those smokers, would you say that for whatever percentage of smokers that is, those smokers were likely not addicted?

A.   Apparently, yes.  Another way to say your question is there has to be a sliding scale of addiction.  It's not yes or no.  There are different degrees.  People are either profoundly addicted or moderately addicted or mildly addicted or not at all. So there's got to be some kind of sliding scale, and that must have to do, not only with the product they're using, the frequency with which they're using it, but also genetic factors.

Q.   So if you look at the next sentence he says, "We all know friends and acquaintances who have been

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 75

able to give up tobacco at once and finally with no discomfort and no regrets."

A.   Sure.

Q.   And that's true; right?  There are individuals who are able to give up smoking without much effort?

A.   Yes.  I think that's true.

Q.   He goes on to say, "But there are others. There is the man or woman who takes to tobacco for much the same reason that a person uses morphine or heroin." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  It goes on to say, "He or she is a mild neuropath who smokes to dull sensibility."

So that type of person, that type of tobacco addict is some kind of psychopath.  There's something wrong with them that leads them down the path of addiction.  And he identifies that as the type of person who is often a chain smoker, who suffers horribly on being derived of the weed, and upon giving it up, speedily relapses.

Q.   So he's describing a smoker who suffers from withdrawal, cravings, relapse; correct?

A.   Yeah, these heavily-addicted people.

Q.   And he says there appears to be no sound reason for denying that such a person is a tobacco

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

addict?

A.   That's what he says.

Q.   And so his conclusion is that, "I submit, therefore, that the answer whether the use of tobacco can be considered an addiction or not depends upon the circumstances and the person."

A.   Right.  Yeah, again, it's -- he's really talking about excessive smoking.  There's nothing wrong with moderate smoking, but excessive smoking can lead one down the path of addiction.

Q.   And is it true that the more one smokes, the more likely one is to become addicted?

A.   Of course.

Q.   And are there smokers who can be moderate smokers who are not addicted?

A.   That's probably true, yes.

Q. And so is it true that whether a person is addicted or not does depend on the circumstances and does depend on the person?

A.   It can, yes.  I mean, you don't want to forget the general pattern that the overwhelming majority of people who smoke regularly are addicted.

Q.   But it is true whether someone is addicted or not depends on their own personal circumstances?

A.   Yes.  For example, if you rarely smoke, you

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

probably -- you're probably not addicted.  So the addiction is really, as you say, a relationship between the product, the person, the circumstance, the habit.

Q.   You talked --

A.   Speak of the devil.

Q.   You must be reading my mind.

A.   How did you pull that out of your hat?  You guys are well prepared.

Q.   I want to show you some exhibits that we'll mark as 13 and 14.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibits 13-14 were marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   These are exhibits that I've seen you use several times at trial.

A.   Right.

Q.   Now, the first one I've handed you is a document from Helmut Wakeham that you frequently use. If you look at Page 20, it says, "Present technology does not permit selective filtration of particulate smoke."

A.   Right.  This is from the 1961 Helmut Wakeham presentation to his R&D committee at Philip Morris entitled "Tobacco and Health R&D Approach."  And it represents what I usually call the end of the single

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

factor theory.

Q.   When he says that "Present technology does not permit selective filtration of particulate smoke," what he's saying is that presently it's not possible to take out a single constituent of cigarette smoke with a filter?

A.   Right.

Q.   Yes.

A.   Or even to reduce it.

Q.   And was that a secret at the time?

A.   I wouldn't call it a secret.

Q.   Was that something that was known outside of the tobacco industry?

A.   Some people knew it.  In other words, it's important to distinguish what some person knows and something is widely known, or something that's a consensus view, what proportion of people.

But it's true that at this period, lots of people were skeptical of filters, if that's where you're going, skeptical that filtration provided any value whatsoever.  That's, after all, why there were the 1957 Blatnik hearings on fraudulent and misleading advertising for filters because it was thought by these Congressmen and experts that the filter fad was fraudulent.

Page 79

Q.   And so when you said it's important to know what percentage, do you know what percentage of people were aware of the idea that selective filtration was not presently possible?

A.   It's a minority view partly just because it's technical.  But if we generalize to the view that filters were offering no advantage, I think that's a minority view simply because it's not yet widely recognized that nicotine is addictive, which, after all, is the main reason that a lot of the modifications of tobacco products up to that point were not conferring safety.

So for various reasons, we know that this is not a very widely understood concept.

Q.   So you mentioned earlier in the depo a woman named Maurine Neuberger?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Who is she?

A.   She was, I think, a senator from Oregon who was an antitobacco activist.

Q.   And did she actually write a book about her antitobacco activism?

A.   Yes.  She writes a book called Smoke Screen, I think it's called, on cigarettes and the public welfare.  I think this is from 1963.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 15 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   If you look at what we've marked as Exhibit 15, you will see that that is a copy of the Smoke Screen book by Ms. Neuberger.  And you are correct.  It was printed in 1963.

A.   Right.

Q.   I want to you look at Page 89, which we've included.  The very last paragraph says, "For the present and the foreseeable future, selective filtration is still largely a dream."

A.   Right.

Q.   Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So that, to be fair, is the same sentiment that Helmut Wakeham was relaying in the document we looked at earlier, right, that selective filtration was not possible at the time?

A.   Well, or at least as something in the future.

Q.   And it says this is -- Maurine Neuberger goes on to say, "This is not to suggest, however, that cigarette manufacturers are today incapable of producing filters that can substantially, though, nonselectively, reduce the incriminated agents in smoke."

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=80
Page 81

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  She really doesn't understand cigarettes.  Again, she doesn't seem to even understand addiction, because that really doesn't make sense, given addiction.  So she, I think, is much like someone like Wynder who is holding out hopes for filters and seems to believe that the low-tar cigarettes really are low tar. So there's a lot of confusion in her statement.

Q.   Is it true, though, when she says that manufacturers are capable of producing filters that reduce the incriminated smoke?  Is it true that the companies were capable of general reduction through filters at the time?

A.   Not really, not in any meaningful sense.  All that really means is:  Could they make small cigarettes? And yes, they could make small cigarettes.  They can make them as small as they like, and that's all general reduction is.  General reduction is just less tobacco, which produces less smoke, which if you were inhaling less smoke, that, in fact, would be good for you. That's all general reduction means.  It doesn't mean anything more than half -- you know, half of a bad thing is better than a whole bad thing.  That's all general reduction means.

Q.   And at the time --

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=81
Page 82

A.   But she's misunderstanding, as if that's some kind of concept in the cigarette design.  It's just common sense.

Q.   I don't know what you mean by that.

A.   Well, she's making it like it's a feature of the cigarette, when really it's just the fact that it's a small cigarette.  She doesn't seem to understand that tar is just condensed smoke.  And if you have less tobacco, you would have less smoke.  She doesn't realize how empty this statement is she's making.  It's an empty statement.

Q.   And at the time in 1963, did other members of the public health community besides Ms. Neuberger believe that filters could potentially remove the harmful agents of smoke?

A.   I think that's pretty common, yeah.  People like Wynder and Doll and others in the public health community had this naive faith in science-based filtration technology, that this could actually make cigarettes safer.  And as we see in court often, there are these epidemiological studies that seem to suggest that the filters are safer, when what's really going on is that the people who smoke filters tend to be people who are less likely to smoke their cigarettes intensively, and therefore, less likely to suffer harms

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

from smoking.

So there's an infusion in the early epidemiology between properties of the product and properties of the consumer, and that's what leads to a lot of this bad epidemiology.

Q.   And at the time of this statement in 1963, were the cigarette companies embarking on programs of general reduction in an effort to make their cigarettes safer?

A.   I don't think so, no.  I think they were embarking on programs of selective reduction to try to make them safer.  In other words, there was an effort to remove certain carcinogenic compounds.

Q.   And why were the companies trying to remove carcinogenic compounds from their cigarettes?

A.   Because they didn't want to be killing people.  It was, as I think Addison Yeaman says, an unattractive side effect of the smoking process.

Remember, the industry wasn't trying to kill people.  They were trying to make money.  And an unfortunate side effect of that was the product was killing people.  They didn't like that fact.  They would rather make money and not kill people.

But, yeah, they didn't do the things they could or should have done to kill fewer people.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=83
Page 84

Q.   What are some of the things that the companies did do in an effort to try to reduce the carcinogenic properties of smoke?

A.   There were many things they did, and it depends on which period in history.  But already in the '50s, they were experimenting with basically catalytic converters that would catalyze the smoke to digest the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, like the benzpyrene. So they would add copper nitrate, palladium, platinum, various catalysts to try to digest those to eliminate the carcinogenic compounds as much as they could.  They shifted away from the arsenic-based pesticides over to the organochlorines, the DDT and so forth, because there was concern that the lead arsenate and lead arsenite being used as pesticides on tobacco was adding extra arsenic and lead to tobacco.  So they shifted away from that.

Going through the different decades, there are other processes that were done.  In the 1990s, Reynolds shifts away from the open flame propane bulk curing method, which was creating extra nitrosamines. They did that to reduce the nitrosamines, probably also to be able to talk about it.

There are other things they did as well, and if you were to list every single one of them, there

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

would be many.  The problem is they were mostly experimental, mostly trivial.  And there were some genuine ones that actually made the product safer, like Premier, Eclipse, or Philip Morris's Next, and the other denicotinized brands, but those were not marketed aggressively and they were not marketed honestly.

So there were some examples where they did nontrivial changes to the design.  So there were many examples.

Q.   When you say "nontrivial," is it your understanding that the company when they made a product modification did it for trivial reasons, or were they doing it in an effort to make their product safer?

A.   Right.  That's an important question.  Early on, I think they were trying to do partly the right thing, by digesting these compounds.  And that made sense in an era of the single factor theory.  When I say "trivially," it's partly -- when I say "trivial," it's partly because it ended up being trivial sort of in retrospect but --

Q.   A little presentism?

A.   I guess that's sort of presentism, yeah.  But also, a lot of these were kept at an experimental level and not implemented to the exclusion of the regular super deadly cigarettes.  So that's sort of a different

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 86

kind of angle.  It's complicated.

Q.   And so after the single factor theory, what theory takes hold of how they can make cigarettes safer?

A.   After the single factor theory, you do have the perpetuation of a modified single factor, which you could call a multi -- a multiple factor theory, which is that maybe there are several compounds and maybe we can reduce some of those.  So even Wakeham says that in the '61 piece.  He says the best we can hope for is to reduce some of the more dangerous compounds.

So it shifts over to that.  So in other words, a kind of less-is-better approach.  And then there are all the other major designs that involve non-burning, you know, inhalable nicotine, taking out the nicotine altogether, a number of -- eventually electronic cigarettes, chewables, smokeless, to an extent that some of the companies were doing heat-not-burn devices, chewables.

The problem is they never took the main products off the market, you know, so they're adding to. That's kind of the root problem, that even though there were alternatives, they were -- these were always additions onto the regular product without ever admitting the regular product was causing massive harm. They were add-ons.

Does that answer your question?

Q.   It does.

A.   Okay.

Q.   I want to switch topics slightly, but in the same vein.  I'll hand you what I'll mark as Exhibit 16. (Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 16 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   I know you've seen this document before.

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so I want to go to under Areas of Special Emphasis, Number 4A.

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it says "the Sutton problem." What is the Sutton problem?

A.   Well, Sutton was one of many materials that was being explored as an alternative smoking substrate. It's sometimes called NSM, or nonsmoking material, or new smoking material.  It's different acronyms.

And what that was was an effort in a sense to make a safer cigarette by eliminating the complex proteinaceous nature of tobacco and replacing it with some kind of substrate from material compound, like a carbonate of some kind or chalk or ceramic that you can basically put nicotine into.  And then when you smoke

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

it, you would get just nicotine, not all these other complex chemicals that are associated with burning a complex organic material.

So this was quite fashionable at the end of the 1960s.  It becomes heavily involved in the tobacco working group.  It's linked to the general philosophy of making a high-nicotine, low-tar product that would deliver the same amount of nicotine at a lower tar value.  So you would have basically a high satisfaction, low cancer ratio, or high addiction, low cancer ratio.

And that was being tested about this time, and it's one of the reasons that you get the Chappel conference -- Chappel correspondence about this time and for the next two or three years where Rodgman and others were working with Clifford Chappel in Montreal to explore the cancer-causing potency of these alternative smoking materials.  And one of those was the Sutton material.

Q.   And so do you know what the problem was that Mr. Galloway is referring to when he says "the Sutton problem"?

A.   I don't recall in particular at that early point.

Q.   And so can we add nonsmoking materials to your list of things tobacco companies did in an effort

to make safer cigarettes?

A.   You could.  You could, yeah, it's -- so long as we realize it was not a very good faith attempt.  In other words, it's honest but flawed because they didn't pursue it energetically while also removing the regular products.  In other words, if they had gone down that path and stopped making regular Camels and Winstons and so forth, that would have been a good thing.  But they never did that.  So that's why it's not an unmitigated good.

Q.   Did you say they didn't pursue energetically?

A.   Right.

Q.   So you don't believe that the companies energetically pursued the Sutton material or other nonsmoking materials?

A.   They certainly did not do it energetically in the sense of, you know, stopping their regular cigarettes and then shifting over to that, which they could have done.  They probably could have made some kind of alternative smoking material that would have been very, very low tar and high nicotine.  And that would have been a good thing if they would have stopped the regular cigarettes.

Q.   And so short of stopping selling traditional combustible cigarettes, could the companies have done

anything, in your opinion, to develop a safer product that you would have called an unmitigated good?

A.   Well, anything that -- well, there's so many things they could have done.  They could have been honest.  They were not honest.  They could have stopped lying.  They didn't stop lying.  They could have stopped trivializing.  They didn't stop trivializing.  They were doing everything they could to keep regular cigarettes as the bulk of their sales.  They could have shifted over to lots of these alternative products that would have been less deadly.

Q.   But specifically on the design front, is there any cigarette design short of stopping selling traditional combustible cigarettes that the companies could have done that you would have said was an honest, energetic, good faith approach?

A.   Yes.  As long as they would have, you know, diminished their other products.  In other words, it's called -- you have to think of the ecology of the action.  It's not like, you know, if you're in Auschwitz and someone offers you tea -- if the Gestapo offers you tea in Auschwitz, that's a good thing, right?  But it's in Auschwitz, right?

So you have to look at the overall ecology, the overall environment of what's going on.  And these

few little good things they did were always tinkerings. But if they had stopped the big evil, then there would have been room for moral praiseworthiness.

Q.   So I think the answer to my question is that no, nothing short of stopping selling combustible cigarettes would have been enough, in your mind, to pursue a safer product?

A.   No.  No, that's oversimplifying my view. That makes me sound like a fanatic, and I'm not a fanatic.

I think there's many things they could have done.  They could have branched out into other fields. They have could have been honest.  In other words, it would have been better if they would have even done exactly what they did while being honest, right?  That would have been a huge step.  They weren't even honest, right?  So there's lots they could have done.

Q.   I want to focus specifically just on what design changes they could have made, not about what they told the public or what they didn't tell the public.

A.   Okay.

Q.   So focusing just on the design, short of selling -- short of just stopping selling, if they had -- what could they have done other than just stopping selling cigarettes on the design front that you

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

would have said would have been an unmitigated good?

A. Well, maybe I could rephrase your question. Good rather than unmitigated, because all those other things do mitigate the good.  They do affect it.

They could have taken out the nicotine.  They could have made cigarettes not inhalable.  They could have gone back to pre-Camel design, which had a lower nicotine level.  They could have manufactured just cigars, just chewing tobacco, just other forms of nicotine delivery.  They could have pushed the nicotine inhalers that were being researched.

They could have just promote -- just produced either Premier and Eclipse, which, in fact, they did do, but they could have promoted those more aggressively and put more marketing into that and less marketing into Camel.  That would have been good.

None of those are unmitigated good because there's a whole complex history we have to think about, but they would have been better than what they actually did.

Q.   So at the time that this -- I guess the Galloway or the second memo is written that we've marked as Exhibit 16, you're not aware of what Galloway is referring to when he say "the Sutton problem"?

A.   Not exactly.  Right.  I mean, it's

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

interesting.  I think it is a little bit later, but I don't think they were yet worried about disclosure. What happens is that Sutton is shown to have caused less cancer in the labs in Montreal, and that becomes a problem, but I think that's a little bit later.

This is still September 23, 1968, and the dangers of having Camel being shown to cause cancer by comparison with the Sutton material, that's not until a year or two later.

Q.   Do you know when Reynolds first became involved in the Sutton material?

A.   It would have been right about this time, probably '66.

Q.   And how did Reynolds become involved?

A.   Well, I think it's their response to the whole Surgeon General's report coming out and new information about cigarettes causing cancer, new worries about, you know, how to make a safer cigarette, one that would either appear safer or would actually be safer. Those are always intentions.

Q.   And why is it called Sutton?

A.   It's after a person named Sutton.  There's a laboratory this guy had -- I forget what his first name was.  But -- and I forget where it was, but there is a laboratory somewhere where they're producing this

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

alternative material.

A lot of these -- a lot of the chemical companies were making alternative materials, Cytrel and -- Kodak was making one.  And Hooks was making one.

Q.   You said Kodak?

A.   Kodak, yeah.  They were making filter materials and synthetic -- so this was kind of a fashionable thing to sort of engineer the tobacco to be simpler chemically so that you would basically produce nicotine but also on a simple chemical substrate that would not burn, basically.

Q.   And you said that at some point later on at Dr. Chappel's lab, they found that the Sutton material caused fewer cancers than a Camel cigarette?

A.   Right.  That's what leads to the Rodgman correspondence with Chappel in the spring of 1970 to destroy all of that correspondence, which they did for legal reasons, which we show that document where Rodgman says that the correspondence with Chappel has been destroyed for legal reasons.

Q. Well, the idea that the Sutton material would be less carcinogenic than Camel, wasn't that the entire point of the project?

A.   Yeah, it was.

Q.   So from the very beginning, Reynolds was

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=94
Page 95

aware of the idea that the Sutton material was likely to be or was less carcinogenic than Camel?

A.   Of course.  There would be no reason of switching over to an artificial substrate for a burning material that you would inhale unless you were trying to achieve genuine safety.

Q. And so why do you think then that Reynolds felt it was a problem that the Chappel lab had found that?

A.   Because the reference cigarette they were using was Camel.  They were testing Sutton material against Camel, and it was found that Camels do cause cancer, obviously.  And this was -- they didn't want that fact, that obvious fact, in their archives.

So it's the dishonesty of the entire conspiracy that unfortunately sort of suppresses the Sutton material.  Do you see what I mean?  So even when they're trying to do the right thing, they're boxed in by the conspiracy, which prevents them from admitting they're doing the right thing, because if they admitted that they were trying to make cigarettes cause less cancer, that would mean admitting that Camels actually do cause cancer.

So they were kind of boxed in by the conspiracy.  That's the problem.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=95
Page 96

Q.   And what evidence do you have -- or do you know why the company didn't want the Camel versus Sutton testing in their file?

A.   Because of these new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that are enacted in 1969 which grant new subpoena powers to plaintiffs' attorneys and allow previously inaccessible internal company documents to be discovered.  So that's why you get new worries about document destruction, new efforts to destroy documents around 1969, because of these new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

It fits sort of with the late '60s kind of environmental activism and people trying to hold corporations liable for being polluters or harming people's health, that sort of thing.  So that's why you see a lot of the linguistic changes in the archives. They become more sensitive about having certain incriminating facts in their archives.

So the very language of archives changes after the '60s.  It becomes less innocent.

Q.   And do you know if or when Reynolds ever abandoned the Sutton program?

A.   Well, at least they destroyed the documentation on it around 1970.  I don't know if they fully abandoned the program.  They probably kept on

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

going because it's an interesting project.  And they may have just transformed it in some way.  But they never seemed to have added significant amounts of NSM, nonsmoking material, to their cigarettes.  I don't really think they did that to any big degree.

So it probably dribbled out in the '70s.

Q. And when you say that they destroyed the documents related to the program, do you know what specific documents were destroyed?

A.   Well, you can't really know, of course, what you can't know.  But there's documentation that says that the -- that some of the documents doing the -- I think they were doing Ames testing.  There were Ames testing, looking at smoking carcinogenicity of the different types of smoking material.  And I think those documents were destroyed, at least some of those.

Q.   Is that the documents that Dr. Chappel was working on?

A.   Yes, among others.  And then so Reynolds destroys its side.  Remember, Clifford Chappel, he's an external contractor researcher in Montreal.  He's not part of Reynolds.  So he's doing an external research. So Rodgman destroys at least some of his documents, and then he leaves it up to Chappel to destroy his.

Now, obviously, Rodgman didn't destroy them

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

all or else we wouldn't even have the document that says "destroyed for legal reasons," and we probably only have that because it was not properly scanned, because it's a handwritten document.  And the handwritten documents were not as easily sanitized by the -- by whoever was governing what should be destroyed and what should not be destroyed.

Q.   And so do you know whether Chappel destroyed his documents?

A.   I think he did, but I'm not sure.  Maybe in his -- maybe he did, maybe he didn't.  He says he did, but we don't really know.  I haven't gone to his private archive in Montreal.

Q.   And where does Dr. Chappel say that he did destroy the documents?

A.   I don't recall.  I know Rodgman leaves it up to Chappel to destroy it, but I don't remember if Chappel actually says he destroyed them.

Q.   So you don't know one way or the other whether Dr. Chappel actually did destroy the research?

A.   Well, we know that Rodgman destroyed the research that was provided to him.  So whether Chappel secretly kept a copy, I don't know.  Obviously, not everything was destroyed because otherwise we wouldn't even know about this project.

Q.   And other than this Galloway to Senkus memo and the handwritten notes by Dr. Rodgman, what other documents have you reviewed in your research or seen in your research related to the Sutton material?

A.   There's thousands.  I mean, Sutton material was a big deal.  I don't think it would be hard to find out what the problem they're talking about is because a lot of the companies were working on alternative smoking materials in the late '60s.  And there's either thousands or tens of thousands of documents on that. The British were doing a lot of it.  They had funny code names, you know, and product names like Cytrel, Sutton material.

Q.   Well, Sutton isn't a code name; right?

A.   Well, it's just a slang term or a shorthand for that alternative smoking material.  Again, they're called NSMs.

Q.   Now, Sutton -- I think you said that Sutton wasn't the only NSM or nonsmoking material that Reynolds investigated over the years?

A.   Right.  Reynolds and all the companies were investigating alternatives means of delivering nicotine that involved burning less tobacco.  Most often the idea was that we could add a carbonate or something else to the tobacco in the cigarette, and this -- by virtue of

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

having less tobacco and more of this inert substance would be a safer product.

Q.   I'll hand you what we'll mark as Exhibit 17. And do you see this is a document from Dr. Di Marco?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Who is Dr.  Di Marco?

A.   Di Marco was head of research for R. J. Reynolds.

Q.   And this is from 1982?

A.   Correct.  It was shortly after he was hired as head of research.

Q.   It says, "Attached please find a report on tobacco substitutes which came from your area some years ago. "

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 19 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   I'm going to hand you what we've marked as Exhibit 19.  This is the response memo from Dr. Piehl?

A.   Right.  Yeah, here it's talking about Cytrel

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

developed by the Celanese Corporation in the United States that was a modified cellulose base with a heavy inorganic mineral loading.  Imperial Chemical in the United Kingdom produced NSM -- acronym for new smoking material -- of similar origin.  And they talk about RDM by Neumann.  That's another European company.

Q.   So I want to look at Exhibit 19.  It says this is from Dr. Piehl to Dr. Di Marco; right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So this is in response to Dr. Di Marco's earlier memo that we just looked at?

A.   Right.

Q.   And it says in the second paragraph that, "But it all boils down to the fact that almost everything on earth has been tried without complete success."

A.   Right.

Q.   And so this shows that the company spent vast amounts of money looking at these tobacco substitutes unsuccessfully?

A.   Exactly.  As they say, two large companies failed with multimillion dollar products, and they're talking about Cytrel and Imperial Chemical's NSM, new smoking material.

Q.   If you look at the fourth paragraph it says,

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

"Our own history" --

They're talking about R. J. Reynolds?

A.   Yes.

Q. -- "involves a several million dollar investment in the '60s in a chemically modified cellulose with poor smoking properties."

A.   Right.  And then they mention their J-10, their patented puffed grains appearing to offer the best potential in terms of smoking quality and superior economics.

So that was one of the other Reynolds synthetic tobacco materials using a grain-based substrate.

Q.   And if you look at Dr. Di Marco's original memo from August 24th, the subject is RDM, 1976, Number 36.

A.   Right.

Q.   Have you ever looked at that tobacco substitute inhouse studies?

A.   Probably.  Yeah, I was interested in this whole NSMs a few years ago.

Q.   And why were you interested in it a few years ago?

A.   It's really interesting, right?  It's really the main thing Reynolds and the other companies were

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

doing before the things like Premier and Eclipse to develop a safer cigarette.  It was also one of the materials that was explored in the tobacco working group.

So it's just -- I'm really interested in cigarette design, and this is an important part of what was happening in the -- mainly in the '60s and '70s. It's not so important after that.  But it's interesting because it's substantive and not just filtration.  You know, it's an actual intervention in the actual design of the cigarette, which is not just smoke and mirrors.

And, again, it's part of the prehistory of the electronic cigarette.  That's another way to think of it: inhalers, heat not burn, Premier, Eclipse, NSM.

Q.   Do you know why none of the NSM materials were successful?

A.   Well, the problem is that if you take all of the tobacco out, it's very hard to produce just a --something that will, A, burn.  It has to burn, right, if it's going to be a cigarette.  B, it has to not taste like rotten rubber or burning fish.  You have to be able to keep it lit.  There are a lot of design features you have to consider.  And if you take -- you can't just have chalk with nicotine on it and smoke that.  It just doesn't work.  So it's just not ultimately feasible.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

In other words, you could always put in --and I think some of the British cigarettes did do this -- put in 10 or 20 percent of some synthetic material, but that doesn't really get you very much because you're still burning a lot of tobacco.  So there's a lot of problems.  It's not a problem really solved in a way until much later because it's very hard to make just a nicotine inhaler that, you know, won't just kill you outright or taste like garbage.

Q.   So do you think that the reason that these nonsmoking materials ultimately didn't work was a failure of the company to spend enough money?

A.   Well, in a way they did work in the sense that they moved on to other things, other ways of delivering nicotine that did not involve combustion.  So if you think of it -- if you step back from it and think of it as one of many stages in the effort to take the combustion out of cigarettes, in a way it ultimately did work, but in a different form.  You see what I mean?

So if you take it at its biggest optic, namely of recognizing the fatal flaws of cigarettes as combustion, it ultimately did succeed, but not in the versions that were around in the '60s and '70s.

Q.   And so this decision by the companies to look at these alternative smoking products is part of a

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=104
Page 105

bigger effort over the years to take the combustion out of cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And that's because the companies at some point realized that the combustion was ultimately what caused cigarettes to be carcinogenic?

A.   Of course.  They realized in the '50s that their burning, you know, produces the death.  And they're trying to digest that or tinker with that or transform that, and they tried a thousand different ways.

Q.   And so I just want to be clear that nonsmoking material or the Sutton cigarette or products like that were never made available to the public, not because the companies buried them, but because they ultimately didn't work and people couldn't use them?

A.   Well, modified, things like Sutton were made available, just more in Britain and never more than, I think, 10 or 20 percent.  In other words, they never found a way to make a completely synthetic object that would deliver nicotine.

So it was a mixture of technical difficulties, conspiracy -- I mean, the conspiracy is important here because they were not -- they couldn't even say they were trying to do the right thing even

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=105

when they were trying to do the right thing.

Q.   So my question is:  Is the reason that the Sutton cigarette never came to market because Reynolds may have had a successful Sutton product and decided to bury it, or is it because the product never really worked, they couldn't get it to be a functioning product that people would use?

A.   Well, I think they may well have made some cigarettes with it.  So it may not have been a total failure.  I don't know that they didn't make 10 million cigarettes with it.  As I said, other similar devices were on a limited basis explored partially.

But all we really know is that it didn't work out very well for multiple reasons.  It was -- the industry was never honest about it.  They never explained why they were doing this or why they were even trying to do it to the public, because that would have admitted a need to make them safer, which they were never willing to admit.

So all of these are framed within the larger conspiracy, and that's the ultimate problem.

Q.   Well, to be fair, if the company had been able to make a Sutton product that people would use and was safer, they certainly would have marketed it; right?

A.   Well, not necessarily.  Because they, after

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

all, could -- they, after all, could and did make products that were safer, like chewing tobacco.  So they did make, you know, products that were less deadly. Some of them made food products, right?

All of these things are decisions they're making.  Philip Morris moves into the food business. Reynolds was in the food business.  So they were doing safer things, just in a nontobacco way.

So there's kind of a continuum in their business strategy.  They're trying to make money, of course, obviously, as is their right.  And they're trying various alternative products along a sliding scale of safety.  Some worked out, some didn't. MR. QUINLAN:  Let's take a break. (Recess taken from 10:12 to 10:19.)

A.   I've seen things like it.  As I said, there's thousands of documents in this arena.

Q.   I want to look at what is Exhibit A to this RDR.  And it is a transcript of the Sutton Research Company's disclosure to Reynolds.  It starts on Page 305.

A.   Is that the Bates?

Q.   At the top, 305.

A.   Yes.  We're looking at around a 400-page document from December 4, 1970 by Alan Rodgman and a number of other people in the research department from the Chemical Research Division titled "The Sutton Research Corporation Smoking Material."

Q.   And you see that the object of this RDR is to study in detail in Sutton Research Corporation process, the smoke composition of the Sutton material, the results obtained, and to compile all data and information regarding the Sutton research into one report?

A.   Right.

Q. And so Appendix A, which starts on 303, is a Transcript of Disclosure of December 6, 1967 by Sutton Research Corporation personnel.

A.   What page is that again?

Q.   303.

A.   303.  Just to be clear, the whole document is Bates, I think, 51755 0186.  Okay.  So I'm on Page 303.

Q.   You will see that it says, "On December 6, 1967, various members of the Sutton Research Corporation and R. J. Reynolds met in Los Angeles, California for the purpose of presenting and auditing a disclosure pertinent to the Sutton smoking material and its manufacture."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the Sutton Research Corporation is the company that developed this summary that we have been discussing?

A.   Exactly.

Q.   And you will see on Page 304 that it's actually not named for someone named Sutton.  The president of Sutton Research Corporation is a gentleman named Ted Briskin?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You see that they have lawyers from Sutton there.

A.   Right.  Sutton must have been the founder, though, of the Sutton Research Corporation.

Q.   And you will see that there are several familiar names from Reynolds at this meeting; right?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

A.   Yes.

Q.   There is Dr. Bright?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Dr. Senkus, Dr. Rodgman, and then Mr. Roemer; correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Mr. Roemer is an attorney for R. J. Reynolds?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so the purpose of this was so that Sutton could disclose its process, techniques and methods for developing the Sutton material to Reynolds?

A.   Right.  Yeah, they had just recently engaged the Sutton Research Corporation in designing this alternative smoking material.  There were working on papaya leaves, for example.  So they're exploring different potential substrates, cellulose.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 21 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q. And the fact that R. J. Reynolds was engaged with the Sutton Research Corporation was not a secret; right?

A.   I don't know the degree of confidentiality. I don't think they ever explained the purpose of the collaboration.  But the collaboration itself, the fact

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

that there was such collaboration, was actually published.

Q.   So this meeting was from December of 1967; correct?

A.   The original meeting, yes, that they are transcribing was December 6, 1967.

Q.   And I want to take a look at what I marked as Exhibit 21.  This is a newspaper article from a few days later, December 8, 1967.

A.   Right.

Q.   And you see it says, "Tobacco Company Testing Product to Modify Smoke"?

A.   That's right.

Q.   This is from the AP Wire Service.  It's from Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

A.   Right.

Q.   It says, "A product which may modify the ingredients of cigarette smoke will be tested and evaluated by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company."

A.   That's right.  And they mention the Sutton Research Corporation of Santa Monica, California.  It says, "a chemical research company with fewer than ten employees."

Q.   And it says that Sutton "has been engaged in developing artificial cigarettes made from vegetable

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

compounds," and "these cigarettes are supposed to be free of nicotine and tar."

A.   Right.

Q.   And "Several organizations have been conducting research into the use of vegetables and other additives to cigarettes as a means of reducing their supposed health hazard."

A.   Yes.  The AP is saying that, not R. J. Reynolds.

Q.   And while R. J. Reynolds may not have come out and said it in this AP article, it's stating the purpose behind this Sutton product was to create a less hazardous cigarette?

A.   Correct.

Q.   So it wasn't a secret that Reynolds was pursuing this Sutton program, at least by December 1967?

A.   Right.  Yeah, it was -- the only secret was, you know, Reynolds not saying that the purpose was to make a safer cigarette.

Q.   But anyone reading this article would see that the purpose was to create a safer cigarette; right?

A.   Hopefully.

Q.   That's pretty clear from the text of the article?

A.   Yes.  That, in fact, was the purpose, even

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

though it was not admitted by Reynolds.  Yeah, on Page 311 of the documents, it's mentioning the discussions with Eastman-Kodak.  You were intrigued by the Kodak connection.

Q.   What was the name of the Kodak nonsmoking material?  Did it say?

A.   I don't know if it mentions it.  There's quite a few pages here.

Q.   Is there something special or unique to the Kodak company that would put them in a unique position to develop a nonsmoking material?

A.   They were a large chemical company, and they had chemical capacity, especially with papers, paper materials.  They were also involved in making filters, actually, filter materials.

So a lot of these large chemical manufacturers were also making polymers, papers and filter materials.  So I think it was a chemical expertise.

Q.   You told me that earlier that part of the company's concern with the Sutton program was that there was indication potentially in their files that Camel cigarettes were more carcinogenic than the Sutton material?

A.   Yes, that's right.  That was in the Clifford

Chappel contract research.

Q.   And so were all the documents destroyed that indicated that Camel cigarettes would have been potentially more dangerous than the Sutton material?

A.   I wouldn't even know about it unless they weren't all destroyed.  So, obviously, some are preserved.

Q.   I'll hand you what we'll mark as Exhibit 22. (Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 22 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   This is a February 23, 1968 document from Alan Rodgman to Dr. Bright.

A.   Yes.

Q.   It says -- it's called the "Investigation of the Sutton Research Corporation Process for Preparation of a Nontobacco Smoking Material."

A.   Right.

Q. The object of this document, it says, was "To study in detail the Sutton Research Corporation process for the preparation of a nontobacco smoking material."

A.   Yes.

Q.   So basically it's saying how Sutton makes their Sutton material?

A.   That's right.  It's Bates 540247 9822 from

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

February 23, 1968.  It's marked RJR Confidential.

Q.   If you look at the second page, he lists some observations about the process.  But I want to go lower to the third paragraph.  It says, "In our hands the described procedure gave a product which, on smoking, burned evenly in a manner simulating tobacco, gave an ash which closely resembled tobacco ash both in appearance and behavior, yielded a smoke with a bland taste in which contained relatively low levels compared with Camel cigarette smoke of several components considered harmful to the smoker by certain authorities."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so even by the time of February 1968, Reynolds was aware that the Sutton material contained lower levels of things like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon than a Camel cigarette?

A.   Upon combustion, that's true.  That was the whole point --

Q.   And that is --

A.   --to simplify the chemistry of the burn to produce a safer cigarette.

Q.   And because of Reynolds' analysis that produced less potentially harmful components, it

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

continued to study the Sutton material?

A.   Yes.  For a while, yes.

Q.   If you look at Table 1, which is on Page 13 --

A.   Right.

Q.   -- you will see that they do a smoke analysis of the Sutton material versus a tobacco blend; right?

A.   Right.

Q.   And you will see that if you look, for example, under polycyclic hydrocarbons and benzopyrene specifically, there's much less than in the tobacco blend itself?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And this document wasn't destroyed by Reynolds; right?

A.   No.  No, partly because it's not a cancer analysis; it's a chemical analysis.  That was always viewed as safer.  The industry was always more willing to talk about the constituents of smoke than its biological impact.

The Clifford Chappel work was animal research.  It was Ames testing to -- and mouse testing, I think, to look at the cancer-causing potency.

Q.   I want to look at Page 80.  And in your research, have you uncovered that there were several

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=116
Page 117

problems with the Sutton material that made its commercial viability a problem?

A.   Yes.  There were taste problems, ash problems, combustion problems, stability.  You would prepare the material, and as it mentions here, without refrigeration there would be decomposition.  One batch of cigarettes apparently, or at least the Sutton material, decomposed to such an extent that it ended up as a very viscous liquid.

Q.   And so without refrigeration, the Sutton material would actually just melt?

A.   Right.

Q.   So that doesn't make a very viable product; right?

A.   No.  You'd end up with some gummy, gooey, sticky mass that couldn't really be smoked.

Q.   I want to look at Page 82 under Recommendations.

A.   And it makes sense because they were eliminating a lot of the fibrous nature of it in this instance.  So it lost some of its physical integrity.

Q.   I want to look at Recommendations on Page 82, specifically the fourth.  And so it says, "The levels in the smoke of certain components considered harmful by some authorities are in general much lower than the

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 118

levels of the components in tobacco smoke."

That's what we were talking about earlier; right?

A.   Yes, that's right.

Q.   It goes on to say that, "Suitable filter tip materials might lower these levels in Sutton material smoke even more."

Do you see that?

A.   I do.

Q.   And so at the time that Dr. Rodgman was writing this memo in 1968, he at least felt that a filter could potentially lower the chemical constituents in smoke?

A.   Right, possibly.

Q.   And so --

A.   It's at least a possibility.

Q.   And as part of that possibility, Dr. Rodgman was interested in that because he felt that lowering those constituents would make the product even more safe; right?

A.   Well, safer, yes.

Q.   And so this is an internal Reynolds document; right?

A.   It is.

Q.   And so Dr. Rodgman nowhere in here says that

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=118
Page 119

filters don't work; right?

A.   Not in here, no.  Neither does he say that they make something safer, though.  He also uses sort of cagey language.  He talks about reducing the materials which some people consider harmful.  So he leaves himself kind of a plausible deniability by not actually admitting anywhere that cigarettes actually cause harm.

Q.   But is it fair that Dr. Rodgman felt, at least at this time, that filters were a way that could potentially make cigarettes or the Sutton cigarette safer?

A.   Possibly.  Possibly.  There's some ambiguity about that.

Q.   And then the other problem that he mentions in this last sentence, "It is realized that there may be harmful components in the Sutton material smoke which are not present in tobacco smoke and vice versa."

And so what he's saying there is there may actually be something in the Sutton material that is dangerous that's not actually even in tobacco smoke?

A.   Right.  That is the general principle that went under the name of "strangers."  The philosophy of Rodgman and others was that whatever manipulation you do of the chemical composition of smoke, you should not introduce strangers, in other words, novel hazardous

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

constituents.  And that's being reflected in this statement.

It's also connected with his interesting philosophy that the heads are all connected to the tails.  In other words, when you modify one component of smoke, you almost invariably modify some other component, and that sort of Uroboros of complexity means that any time you monkey with the smoke of a cigarette, you're not likely to actually end up improving it.

Q.   And based on the analysis that Dr. Rodgman had done, he didn't say to Reynolds, you know, this has fewer constituents than Camel so we should shut the program down?

A.   No.  That's elsewhere.

Q.   Rodgman actually says the opposite; right? He says because this product shows lower levels of carcinogenic compounds, we should continue to research?

A.   That's right.  Well, that's the whole point. This is before the new Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which are only enacted in 1969.  That's what leads to the wave of document destruction and making sure that they don't have dangerous incriminating evidence in their own archives.  This is a few months before that.

Remember, the Senkus to Crohn memo is not until mid December 1969.

Q.   Is it fair, though, that this document and others do show in Reynolds' file that they had been comparing the Sutton material to Camel cigarettes?

A.   Well, I don't know.  Did they mention Camel here?  They certainly mentioned comparing it to their regular cigarettes.  I'm not sure they mention Camel in this case.  I didn't notice.

But since that's one of their main brands, that would presumably be one of the reference cigarettes they're testing.

Q.   I think the first sentence that we read from Page 2 said that it "yielded a smoke with a bland taste and which contained relatively low level compared with Camel cigarette smoke of several components considered harmful to smokers."

A.   Okay.

Q.   So the reference here they were using was Camel?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So after Reynolds did this smoke analysis, they actually then contracted with Clifford Chappel to do bio-assay research?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And Clifford Chappel's entity is called Bio Research Laboratories?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

A.   Yes.  In Montreal, Quebec.

Q.   Do you know what type of bio-assay research they did?

A.   I think they did multiple types: mouse, testing, probably paramecia testing, probably many different kinds.  It's a little bit before the Ames test becomes widely available.

Q.   Now, I'm familiar with the Dr. Rodgman handwritten note that you referred to earlier.  I don't have a copy with me.  But I believe they say something to the effect of:  Destroy reports for legal reasons?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And --

A.   He also says he'll leave it up to Clifford Chappel to destroy his copies.

Q.   And I think we said that you didn't know one way or the other whether Chappel actually destroyed his copies?

A.   Not for sure.  I assume he did, but I can't know for sure.

Q.   I'm going to hand you what we'll mark as Exhibit 23.

Q.   This is a letter from Clifford Chappel to Dr. Senkus.

A.   Yes.

Q.   So it says, "The project will be terminated following my telephone conversation with Dr. Rodgman of April 24, 1970."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is that in reference to the Sutton project that we were talking about earlier?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And Dr. Chappel actually writes to Dr. Senkus and says, "All notebooks pertaining to these projects will be retained in our file for future reference."

A.   So he says.

Q.   And do you know one way or the other whether he did that?

A.   No.

Q.   Is there any way for you to find out?

A.   Well, for one thing, I don't really know exactly what "all notebooks" refers to.  And say he destroyed 90 percent.  How would you know which percent he did?  It's kind of unknowable.

Q.   Have you ever gone to Bio Research Labs to ask for any of their documents related to this project?

A.   No.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 24 was marked for identification.) BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   Let me hand you what I've marked as Exhibit 24.

A.   That last document, by the way, is Bates 50155 1242.

Q.   I'm going to hand you this from a publication called Tobacco Reporter.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Are you familiar with that publication?

A.   Somewhat.

Q.   And so the title is "Tobacco Reporter smoked a paper cigarette."

"How does a paper cigarette taste?  Tobacco Reporter's representative visited the Sutton Research Laboratory in Santa Monica, California earlier this month to find out."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The very first paragraph says that, "Last month R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company issued a brief statement saying it had 'completed its evaluation' of a product developed by Sutton and 'after thorough testing

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

and evaluation begun in December of 1961,   Reynolds has reached the conclusion that the product developed by Sutton does not successfully achieve its intended purpose.'"

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  What is the date of this again, this document we're looking at?

Q.   You know, I don't see a date on here, to be fair.

A.   It's probably about the same date as this Winston-Salem AP press release "Tobacco Company Testing Product to Modify Smoke."  It's got to be after that.

But anyway, I would just like to know the date.  Probably sometime in the late '60s but --

Q.   So under the section titled "Lowering polycyclics and carbonyls."

A.   Yes.

Q.   It says, "He" -- and I believe the he is Mr. Briskin -- "told Tobacco Reporter's representative that currently 'polycyclics and carbonyls are all lower in Sutton paper cigarettes than in tobacco products,' a statement that Tobacco Reporter confirmed with another member of the laboratory staff who added that there are essentially no new polycyclics or carbonyls in the smoke from Sutton material that are not in tobacco smoke."

pgNbr=125
Page 126

A.   Right.  The so-called "strangers."

Q.   Let's go to the next paragraph.  It says towards the bottom, "Reportedly 3-4 benzopyrene on this test measured 3 to 6 nanograms for the paper cigarette compared with 2 6 nanograms for the tobacco version. These measurements were made four or five months ago."

A.   Right.

Q.   Do you know how the Tobacco Reporter would have gotten those tests?

A.   Probably from Reynolds, because Tobacco Reporter is a trade journal.

Q.   Now, the Tobacco Reporter is a publicly-available trade journal?

A.   I think it is.  I think it's a publication.

Q.   So if you look at the third to the last paragraph it says, "In response to an inquiry by Tobacco Reporter, a Reynolds spokesman states that its analysis of the Sutton material disclosed that certain components not found in tobacco smoke comprised the bulk of the smoke that would be inhaled when smoking Sutton cigarettes.

"Because of the public interest in this subject, Reynolds trusts the Sutton Research Corporation would agree to the publication of Reynolds complete test data relating to its evaluation of the Sutton material."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Have you seen any of the research that show that the Sutton cigarettes contained components not found in tobacco smoke?

A.   Some.  We saw some of that in some of this, these big documents we have been looking at.

Q.   And so, again, it wasn't a secret that Reynolds started looking at the Sutton program, and it also wasn't a secret that Reynolds terminated the Sutton program; correct?

A.   I don't know about the termination part.  I think that what was kept secret was the logic for the termination, namely, the fact that Camel cigarettes were being shown to cause more cancer.  But, that, certainly Reynolds didn't want public.

Q.   So was it your opinion that the reason that Reynolds stopped the Sutton program was because it found that Camel cigarettes had more carcinogenic activity than the Sutton's?

A.   Well, only part of the program.  I think the Sutton project had lots of other aspects to it.  But the Clifford Chappel part was clearly terminated because of the concerns that it would reveal Camel cigarettes as causing cancer.

Q.   Let me hand you what I've marked as Exhibit 25.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 25 was marked for identification.)

THE WITNESS:  Yes. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   This is from Murray Senkus to Mr. Galloway?

A.   That's right.  It's from December 30, 1968.

Q.   And under Sutton Project it says, "Based on the findings of our year-long intensive study, the Sutton process and project do not appear to offer a useful solution to the tobacco-health problem.

"Research on this project is being terminated."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It goes on to say that, "Termination of work on the Sutton project will free personnel and facilities for evaluation of the Celanese material." Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  A different alternative smoking material.

Q.   So after a shutdown of the Sutton program, Reynolds continued to look at alternative smoking products, or NSMs?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And so that included the Celanese project?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And do you know what the Celanese material is?

A.   I forget the composition, but it's one of these many purified cellulose alternatives.  In other words, if you can make a very simple plant material that would be -- that would produce less complex combustion materials, that would presumably be safer.  But I don't remember the exact composition.  I think that was the Cytrel -- the Cytrel we were talking about.

Q.   And here's my question:

If it's your opinion that Reynolds shut down the Sutton program because it found that it -- in part at least -- that its own Camel cigarette was found to be more carcinogenic than the Sutton material, why would they continue to look for other alternative products? MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  Well, it just � what's operating here is they don't want to be found to have dangerous information in their archives.  So that's why they destroyed the Chappel studies.  It doesn't mean they weren't still looking for other ways to make cigarettes safer.  I mean, they did.  After all, they

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

did Premier and Eclipse.  Of course, even Premier and Eclipse they didn't talk about publicly as being safer products because the conspiracy is still in effect. So they were collaborating with Sutton or Celanese or all of these companies for many different purposes, but they're becoming increasingly guarded internally about the kind of language they can use for fear of those internal documents being discovered through litigation. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   But --

A.   So it's not at all surprising that they keep trying new things, you know.

Q. Do they continue to test these newer products like Celanese or Cytrel or any other products against a reference Reynolds cigarette?

A.   They probably did, yes.

Q.   And did they continue to do biological testing on those cigarettes?

A.   Probably.  Some are destroyed, like the mouse house massacre.  That ends the big mouse testing program.  So, you know, some of these things continue, but they become more and more careful to make sure it doesn't become public.

And they're kind of in a bind, right?  They

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

want to do safer cigarette research, but they don't want to be found out to be doing safer cigarette research. So it affects the kind of language they can use to describe that project, sometimes internally, sometimes publicly.

Q.   Well, when we looked at Exhibit 21, it wasn't a secret that they were doing safer cigarette research?

A.   Yeah.  But they were not admitting that. It's reported in the press that they're doing safer cigarette research, but they never themselves said that their purpose was to create a safer cigarette because that would be admitting that cigarettes were not safe.

So all the time, things are being reported, but Reynolds itself, thanks to the irony of conforming to the conspiracy, never admitted that there was a need for safer cigarettes.

Q.   Where did the information come from in this Exhibit 21?

A.   Well, it doesn't say, does it?  I mean, this is a report by the Associated Press, and the Associated Press is concluding that the companies are looking to reduce their supposed health hazard.  But Reynolds itself never said, "We are trying to make cigarettes safer."  That would have violated the conspiracy.

I mean, think about it.  It's kind of amazing

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

in all the millions of documents that are public, you don't have any of the companies saying, "We need to make cigarettes safer."  You don't find that during the whole conspiracy.  It's a remarkably powerful and well-policed conspiracy.  But certainly other people are commenting on what they're doing.

Q.   Well, then, how effective can a conspiracy be that they're not making safer cigarettes if the AP can simply write an article and divine that that's what they're doing?

A.   Well, there's several answers to that question.  One, it was a very effective conspiracy because they reversed the decline in consumption of cigarettes that began dramatically in 1953 and '54 and rescued the reputation of the cigarettes for several decades.

The second answer to your question is that it wasn't a perfect conspiracy, otherwise, we wouldn't have any of these documents.  They screwed up, right?  So it's not a perfect conspiracy.

So those are kind of two ways to think about your question.  Certainly it wasn't very effective, but even the industry itself knew it was only a holding strategy, meaning that it would eventually come undone.

Q.   But anyone that picked up this AP article

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=132
Page 133

from 1967 would know that Reynolds was trying to develop a safer cigarette; correct?

A.   Well, unless they believed the industry, which was that there was no need for a safer cigarette. In other words, it depends on what they would believe. If they picked up Maurine Neuberger's book and read it and believed it, they would know there was this powerful denial of campaign.

But if they believed what Reynolds or any of the other companies said, they could well be sucked into the mythology of the conspiracy.

Q.   And how did Maurine Neuberger come to her conclusions about the cigarette industry?

A.   Well, she had open eyes and she listened and she was not as victimized as some people were.  Though as we've already seen, she made some mistakes about cigarette design, right?

So she had some problems, but not everyone is fooled by the conspiracy, obviously.

Q.   And what about Mr. Sickel?  Do we know whether he was fooled or not?

A.   Maybe you do, but I don't.  He certainly smoked a lot of cigarettes.

Oh, yeah, that's one other thing I was told, that he had maybe 30 to 40 pack years.  So in a way,

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=133
Page 134

those pack years are walking proof of the conspiracy, because people like him ended up, you know, smoking and dying from the product.  And at least the smoking part was the whole goal of the conspiracy, was to keep people smoking.

Q.   Is it possible for people to smoke and not be fooled by the conspiracy?

A.   It's possible, sure.

Q.   Dr. Proctor, those are all the questions I have for you.

A.   Thank you.

"God

	with a Japanese

Q.   And what is the thrust of the book?

A.   The thrust of the book is to create a critical historiography of cigarette production in China.  It's co-authored with several Chinese colleagues and colleagues who work on China, and the general point is to stress the importance of looking, not just at consumption, but production of cigarettes, how the Chinese cigarette industry got going over the course of the long 20th century.

So we have chapters -- and I only wrote the preface and then the afterword, but we have chapters on women's smoking in China.  We have chapters on the impact of the 194 9 revolution.  We have a discussion of Mao's cigarettes.  He had his own personalized cigarettes made for him.  We have a deconstruction of the Shanghai Tobacco Museum, which is the largest in the world.  It's made to look like a Mayan temple.

We have quite a number of chapters which talk about the structure of the Chinese cigarette monopoly, because, as you know, it's not a private corporation, it's a monopoly of the state so it has certain interesting different features.  But a lot of it is looking at the same kinds of filter mythologies, and some of the Chinese efforts to make a Chinese-style cigarette, which by virtue of using various herbs and

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=136
Page 137

spices would supposedly be safer.

So it's looking in a way at the same kinds of things we discuss in the United States, but from a less well-documented Chinese perspective.

Q.   Is there mention of the U.S. manufacturers, and specifically, Philip Morris or R. J. Reynolds?

A.   Probably a mention, but not a -- it's pretty much Chinese focused.

Q.   And you said you contributed the preface and the afterword?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What was the topic, I suppose, of what you were saying in the preface?

A.   It's really just an introduction to the magnitude of the problem in China, that they smoke 2.7 trillion cigarettes, nearly 45 percent of all the world's cigarettes.  And just to sort of set the stage for why we need to look at, not just consumption, but production.  It's sort of an outlining of the whole problem.

And, again, the whole point of the book is to stimulate new research into China in the tobacco realm.

Q.   Do you do any sort of comparison between the U.S. market and U.S. consumption with China?

A.   Well, we do note that many of the same things

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=137
Page 138

that happened in the U.S. are now happening in China. The epidemic is later.  It's like a three- or four-decade displaced epidemic.  So we comment on that. We comment on aspects of the filter fraud in the United States in order to elucidate the filter fraud in China, which is surprisingly similar, but our focus is mainly on the Chinese context.

Q.   You said this book was published?

A.   It's just out.

Q.   It's just out?

A.   I haven't seen the physical copy, but I think it's available -- it's been available for a couple of months on Amazon, though maybe it's only being shipped this week.

Q.   Well, congratulations.

A.   Thank you.

Q. Did you do specific research into China and their cigarette consumption and manufacturing, or did you leave that up to your coworker?

A.   I did some research, but it was fairly general research.  Most of what I did was edit the horrific English of our Chinese colleagues.

Q.   You edited the entire book?

A.   Yes.  I mean, most of it.  We sort of divided up the tasks, but I tried to read as much of it as I

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

could.

Q.   I called them coworker.  I meant co-authors.

A.   Yes.

Q.   How did you join forces with these particular individuals?

A.   Well, one of the co-authors is Matthew Kohrman, who is a colleague at Stanford in the anthropology department.  And he is an ethnographer of tobacco in China.  He actually has a place he lives in Kunming and does field research from Kunming, the tobacco growing center of China.  I have known him for many years.  He's a more junior colleague than I am, but we've known each other for a long time.  So it was through that collaboration with our other two co-authors, Gan Quan and a woman named Liu Wennan at Berkeley.

So we had sort of known each other, and so we realized there was this gap in scholarship about China. So that's what we tried to fill.

Q.   And then the second change, I think, or update to your C.V. is this article "God is Watching"?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I haven't seen that yet.  So can you describe that for me?

A.   It's publicly available.  You can just click

that title and get the thing.  It's very short.  It's only two or three pages.  It's a kind of commentary on the importance of digital archives for doing a new type of history, in other words, the mass searching through of documents that we actually all do as part of litigation and other scholarship.  I'm commenting on the value of such archives.

What it is, it's in reference to the launch of a new site called toxicdocs.org, I think it's called, which is a new site on the chemical industry based upon documents that have been released through chemical litigation, litigation against the chemical industry.

So there's lead documents, American Petroleum Institute documents, Dow, DuPont documents, Monsanto, a number of others -- I think there's even some pharmaceutical documents -- in any event, documents that have come about through either lead litigation or asbestos litigation or vinyl chloride litigation that are now available, much like the tobacco documents, in a more searchable form.  I haven't really mastered that Web site yet.  It uses different search algorithms and methods.  But it's becoming available for scholarly use, and that's new.

So upon the release of this new Web site, there was a request that various authors talk about the

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

importance of large-scale digital archives.

Q.   A request by whom?

A.   I don't remember who originally requested it, but I think the Toxic Docs is being run by Columbia University, people like David Rosner, Jerry Markowitz, a number of other scholars that put together this Web site.

Q.   Does the -- maybe you don't know.

Does this Web site Toxic Docs have tobacco --

A.   There's probably --

Q.   -- documents?

A.   --a few in there, but only by accident.  I haven't really searched for that purpose, but it's possible there are a few just by virtue of -- if a chemical manufacturer happened to correspond with Philip Morris, there might be some correspondence in that sense.

Q.   And then tell me about this spread of conspiracy article in Japan.

A.   Into Japan.

Q.   Into Japan.

A.   That's a project that I've been working on for a while with my Japanese co-author, who originally was a student of mine at Penn State many years ago.  And we had originally done an article for Lancet about some

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

of the research that was done in Japan, and we published that maybe ten years ago.

And so she wanted to do something new.  I was happy to work with her again.  And we had the idea of looking into a particular institution called the Smoking Research Foundation, and that's sort of the CTR for Japan.  And so it's a history of the Smoking Research Foundation, and that begins in 1985, right about the same time that the Tobacco Institute of Japan is established.  And so those two entities, the Tobacco Institute of Japan and the Smoking Research Foundation, those become the main instruments of denial for the --in the Japanese context for the last 30 years.

And it's still ongoing.  It's a little bit different from the United States in several interesting ways.  One is it's still ongoing in this sort of different way that it's -- CTR is gone in the United States.  But it also was a little different in the sense that it's supporting research on both sides.  So it funded a lot of research and continues to fund research saying cigarettes do cause harm, and that gives it a kind of a balance that the CTR didn't have.

So we look at how that worked and the particular threats to the sale of cigarettes in Japan, how those impacted the formation of these things.  So

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

it's mainly about secondhand smoke because it's later. We're talking about the '80s and the '90s and later.  So it has different features just by virtue of being a few decades later than the American experience.

And we name names, and we have tables of how this tobacco money has penetrated very high levels of Japanese society, the medical establishment.

Q.   Okay.  For this specific case, the Sickel case, do you have any specific or unique opinions regarding Philip Morris USA or their documents that you haven't testified to?

A.   I doubt it.

Q.   Okay.  I want to talk about Dr. DeNoble.  And as I understand it, you have a chapter about -- or I won't call it a whole chapter.  You have mentioned him in the Golden Holocaust book?

A.   Yes.  That would be at the most, I would think, a paragraph.

Q.   A paragraph.  Yes, at most a paragraph.  It was in the context of instances in which research was getting too close to the truth with Next. Do you recall that?

A.   Yes.  It's a combination of that and the fact that he's one of the first, if not the first, whistleblowers.

Q.   And I think you have claimed in your testimony that Dr. DeNoble wanted to make an argument that sugars produced -- I'm going to say it wrong --acid --

A.   Acetaldehyde.

Q.   -- acetaldehyde synergy with nicotine, which makes it, in turn, more addictive?

A.   Yes.  That's his claim, that it makes a dopamine synergy in the brain, this sugar mixing with the -- the sugar producing the acetaldehyde with certain mixes with the nicotine, he found an extra addictive behavior in the rats that he was giving this to.

Q.   And have you conducted research in order to determine whether this claim was indeed true or not?

A.   Not independently, no.

Q.   And you say "not independently," but do you have other research that you didn't do independently that suggests that this particular claim is true?

A.   No.  It's just I haven't seen research that contradicts it.  He makes a pretty strong case.  And he also has a -- there's that film about him, which is good, called Addiction, Inc. --

Q.   Right.

A.   -- that talks about his story.

Q.   And let me ask you this about what you have

done with Dr. DeNoble.

I think you've testified before you've watched Addiction, Inc.?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Have you read any of Victor DeNoble's testimony in court-of-law cases?

A.   I probably have.  But more importantly, I've spoken with him himself and I've read some of his papers.  But I don't recall reading his testimony.  I probably have, but I don't recall it.

Q.   You understand he's given a lot of sworn testimony in various depositions, including a USA trial?

A.   I understand that, yes.  I don't know.  I'm not very familiar with that.

Q.   Have you read his testimony to Representative Waxman's committee that he gave in 1994?

A.   I don't think I've read it.  I had seen some of it in, you know, in that movie.

Q.   And you said you've spoken to him. When did you speak with him?

A.   It's been a few years, but we have been invited to similar events.  We were together in Korea a few years ago jointly as part of a program on looking at tobacco.  I think that's maybe the only time I've been at a public venue with him.

Q.   And have you, when you were with him in these events, spoken about his particular accounts of what happened with his research at Philip Morris?

A.   I listened to it.  I heard him describe it. I haven't really spoken with him about it very much.

Q.   What do you mean "I've listen to him describe it"?

A.   Well, he's a public figure.

Q.   Okay.

A. So I've seen his speeches. He's on YouTube. He's written up a lot. So a lot of his views are very accessible publicly.  That's all I mean.

Q.   I understand.  So you've heard him speak about it publicly, but you yourself have not had a specific conversation with him about his time at Philip Morris?

A.   Well, I probably have.  But I blur kind of what he said publicly and what he said to me.  They're sort of the same.

Q.   Okay.

A.   In my mind, I don't segregate out what he said in YouTube and what he told me specifically.

Q.   Can you at all specifically remember anything that he told you personally and specifically about his time at Philip Morris?

A.   Not really.  It seemed pretty consistent with his general line.  I think he gives kind of the same speech about this in different contexts.

Q.   And what is your understanding of his general line?

A.   Well, just that he was in this kind of room with darkened windows.  You know, that he was looking at the role of acetaldehyde in animal experiments.  And when he wanted to publish about this, he was essentially barred from publishing and then eventually fired.

Q.   Anything else?

A.   That's the main things I remember.

Q.   You said you also read some of his papers?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Which papers?

A.   Well, he published -- tried to publish and then eventually did publish some of his work on psychopharmacology of acetaldehyde.  I think I remember seeing that paper.

Q.   Do you remember the conclusions?

A.   Just that the acetaldehyde made it more addictive.

Q.   How many of these papers do you think you read of Victor DeNoble?

A.   Well, there's only a couple, I think.  But I

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

think I've looked at both of them many years ago.

Q.   Have you read any internal company documents authored by Victor DeNoble during his time at Philip Morris?

A.   I probably have, but I don't recall them.

Q.   You don't recall which ones sitting here today?

A.   No.

Q. What was the basis of your chapter or your sentiment in Golden Holocaust? I noticed you didn't cite any Philip Morris documents.

A.   I'm not sure you said that question right.

Q.   Sure.

A.   My -- there's 2,000 citations in Golden Holocaust.  Are you talking about on Victor DeNoble?

Q.   Just on Victor DeNoble.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Just specifically with Victor DeNoble.  I'm just wondering what the basis was for your paragraph that you have in Golden Holocaust since there were no citations to Victor DeNoble documents.

A.   Okay.  I see what you're saying.

Q.   Yes.

A.   It would have been the things we've already talked about, those two papers and his YouTube presence.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

He goes around and gives speeches, mainly to kids, and he's testified in various venues.  So that would be the basis for it.  I don't think I discovered anything new that was not, you know, already known about Victor DeNoble.

Q.   So Dr. DeNoble worked at the Philip Morris Behavioral Research Lab.

Do you understand that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And in between the years 1980 to approximately 1984?

A.   That sounds right.

Q.   And we talked a little bit already about these, the nicotine and addiction studies that he was looking at?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Are you familiar with the self-administration studies?

A.   Yes.  I think that's what we're talking about.

Q.   Right.

A.   These things he like --

Q.   The mouse and the lever?

A.   He likes to slam the table and say the mice or the rats were really pounding it for more of this

nicotine.

Q.   And in Victor DeNoble's documents, he was clear in his industry documents that his self-administration studies were not equivalent to addiction studies.

Have you seen that?

A.   No.  I haven't seen that, but I feel like I'm about to.

Q.   Let me show you what I've marked as Exhibit 27.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 27 was marked for identification.)

THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  This is an article by Victor DeNoble, Bill Dunn, Tom Osdene and F. Ryan from July 23, 1980, writing to Bob Seligman. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   And this is -- the subject of this particular memo is self-administration, reinforcement and addiction.

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it's talking about these studies with the rats and the lever that we've just been talking about; correct?

A.   Well, he was just beginning them.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=150
Page 151

Q.   He was just beginning?

A.   His conclusions about the addiction come later.

Q.   And so he first talks about -- he wanted to explore this misunderstanding of the technique of self-administration; correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   That's what he says in the first paragraph?

A.   Right.

Q.   And he says, "The layman tends to think of the term self-administration of drugs as 'addiction to drugs.'"

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So he goes on to talk about the addictive drugs and examples of reinforcers.  Then he comes down to a tentative conclusion down at the bottom?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The very last paragraph?

A.   Right.

Q.   And he says, "The tentative conclusion seems clear:  Nicotine is a reinforcer in the class of 'nonaddictive' chemical compounds such as saccharin or water."

A.   That's what he says.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=151
Page 152

Q.   He goes on to say, "The establishment of nicotine's position among reinforcers, coupled with clear evidence that nicotine self-administration does not meet the established criteria for 'addiction' would be most helpful in clarifying smoking behavior."

A.   That's a quote.

Q.   I read that correctly?

A.   Yes.  That's, of course, before he does his experiments.

Q.   Sure.  This is in 1980 when he first joined the Behavioral Research Lab?

A.   Right.  Exactly.

Q.   I want to show you some of the testimony that he gave under oath in a federal court case in the Eastern District of New York.  I have the -- let me mark it.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 28 was marked for identification.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   I have the entire transcript if you want to see anything in it.

A.   Okay.

Q.   So this is, as you can see, the Sackman case.

A.   Yes.

Q.   And this deposition was of Victor DeNoble.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

A.   Yes.

Q.   And this was taken on -- here we go, October 9, 1995.

A.   Okay.

Q.   If I can direct you to Page 201 --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- Line 14.

A.   Okay.

Q.   And this is obviously after he was at Philip Morris and after he started his research on self-administration?

A.   Right.

Q.   And after he conducted some of the research on -- I keep -- acetaldehyde?

A.   Acetaldehyde.

Q.   And nicotine; correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   He's already done all that.  It's ten years later, or 11 years later.  And he was asked a question on 201/14:

"Q.  Were you of the view up to 1984 that you did not believe it was correct to say that nicotine was addictive based on what you knew at that time?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=153
Page 154

A.  Based on my research at Philip Morris I don't think I would have used the word 'addicting,' no.'" Do you see that?

A.   Right.

Q.   And that was after all the sugar and nicotine research that he had conducted at Philip Morris; right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It goes on to say on Page 202/4: "Q.  And you never told your employer up to that period in time that you thought cigarette smoking was addicting?

A.  No, I don't believe I did. Q.  And, indeed, you did not believe it was addicting during that period of time? A.  Yes, I think that's an accurate statement.  I think I was more skeptical because there wasn't enough scientific data to make that conclusion, at least not data available to me.  Now, had there been other data made available from other tobacco

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

companies and even Philip Morris, that may have been a different conclusion." Do you see that? A.   Yes, I do. Q.   Okay. A.   It goes on.  He's asked:

"Q.  But now you believe cigarette smoking is addictive? A.  I believe there is a substantial body of evidence and there is enough people with expertise in this area far beyond mine that have concluded that nicotine -- that cigarette smoking" --

I assume is an addicting agent, something like that, I think.

Q.   I can finish it for you:

"Is an addictive process.  I don't see any significant information to challenge that at this point."

A.   Yes.

Q.   He's talking in 1995.  At this point, he believes there is a substantial body of evidence?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

A.   Right.  Is that when his depo is, 1995?

Q.   Yes.  October of 1995, on the front page.

A.   Okay.

Q.   But at least with respect to his testimony, his sworn testimony, he did not believe at the time in 1984 at Philip Morris that cigarette smoking was addicting?

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  That's what he says. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Let me hand you what is marked as Exhibit 29. (Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 2 9 was marked for identification.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   And, Dr. Proctor, this is a memo to Dr. Seligman from Victor DeNoble and Lisa Carron. Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  From February 3, 1981.

Q.   So at this time it looks like -- the title is "Studies of Intraventricular Infusions of Negative Nicotine on Behavior Maintained Under Fixed Ratio Schedules."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So it looks like at this point in 1981,

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=156
Page 157

Victor DeNoble has started all of his experiments; correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And this memo talks about the infusion of nicotine and what effect that has on feeding behavior?

A.   Yes.  And then on the second page, he says, "It should be noted that the results support the hypothesis that nicotine's actions on feeding behavior do not fit criteria for an 'addictive' substance."  And "not" is in all caps and underlined.

Q.   You're doing my job for me.

Yes, that's what it says; correct?

A.   You're welcome.

Q.   That was his conclusion at that point --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- in 1981?

A.   He puts "addictive" in quotes as well.

Q.   Okay.  I'm going to show you another document.  We're done with that unless you have other comments.

A.   No.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 30 was marked for identification.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Here's another Victor DeNoble document marked

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

as Exhibit 30. So this one is dated October 5, 1983, a couple of years later than that last document we looked at.

A.   Yes.

Q.   And this one is to Dr. J. L. Charles by Dr. DeNoble and Dr. Mele?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And at this point in time, now we're talking about --

A.   The acetaldehyde research.

Q.   Acetaldehyde.  I don't know why I can't say that.

A.   It's very hard.

Q.   I'm going to look at the word.

A.   It's an aldehyde, and it's got sort of an acetal group.

Q.   Acetaldehyde.  So at this point in time, this is the research that we mentioned earlier with the nicotine and the acetaldehyde?

A.   Right.

Q.   And the subject of this was the "Behavioral Effects of Termination of Chronically Administered Nicotine - Acetaldehyde Combinations on Lever Pressing Maintained under a Fixed Ratio Schedule of Food Presentation in Rats."

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=158
Page 159

A.   Right.

Q.   So they kind of did a combination of nicotine and acetaldehyde?

A.   That's right.  They're looking at a possible synergistic relationship between infusions of both nicotine and acetaldehyde as opposed to either alone.

Q.   Right.  And if it were the case that the sugars or the acetaldehyde had some effect on the nicotine, the hypothesis would have been that the rats would be pressing the lever more?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  And so he goes through his data.  And if you take a look at the last page on Page 3 --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- here's the conclusion at the very last paragraph.  "The failure to find any disruption in food resourced lever pressing when chronic nicotine-acetaldehyde administration was terminated across several doses and across several dosing schedules is strong evidence that chronic exposure to the combination of compounds does not result in a physiological dependence."

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It's actually the opposite of what I just said, as we didn't necessarily see any kind of --

A.   Synergy.

Q.   -- synergy, right.  Thank you.

A.   At this point, yes.

Q.   Do you have any evidence or evidence to the contrary that contradicts DeNoble's documents that show that the nicotine-acetaldehyde combination doesn't result in any kind of physical dependence?

A.   Well �

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  He certainly in all of his speeches talks about the powerful reinforcing aspects of it.  So maybe that should be distinguished from the withdrawal phenomenon, but he does certainly talk about that aspect of addiction, at least later in his talks, that there is this strong reinforcing aspect. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   When have you heard these talks?  When are the dates of these talks?

A.   Well, I remember him doing this in the '90s, but he's on sort of the lecture tour and you see him on YouTube, that sort of thing.

Q.   Is he being paid for these lectures, to your knowledge?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

A.   I think for the children he probably is paid something.  I don't think he gets paid a lot, but I haven't really asked him about his lecture fees.

Q.   You also said you learned, I think, from some of his lectures that he was unable to publish some of his research?

A.   Originally.

Q.   Originally?

A. Yes, he was not permitted to. And then, of course, he did eventually publish it, but he had some trouble getting Philip Morris's permission originally.

Q.   I'm going to take a look at some publications he did or was able to publish while he was at Philip Morris.

Have you seen any nicotine research that Dr. DeNoble published in between the 1980 to 1984 time frame?

A.   I don't recall that date.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 31 was marked for identification.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q. Doctor, I've handed you Exhibit 31. Sorry. It's a terrible, terrible copy.

internal correspondence.

Q.   Sure.  And this was the -- what we just looked at, which was the infusions of the acetaldehyde and the nicotine on behavior?

A.   Right.

Q.   And this was --

A.   It's really more a conference presentation.

Q.   A presentation.  We'll call it a presentation.  But this was something that he was able to present on when he was employed with Philip Morris?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the date of this is November 1981?

A.   Right.

Q.   And it looks like it was reprinted from the Society of For Neuroscience Abstracts?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you know what that is?

A.   Not apart from just what it implies from the title there, a society for neuroscience.  And they would have conferences and they would print your abstract before your talk.

Q.   I don't know if you can read this at all, but just based on the title alone, this abstract or public presentation was reflective of the internal research he was doing and what we just saw in that memo?

Q.   Doctor, I've handed you what's been marked as Exhibit 32.

A.   Yes.

Q.   And this is an article that was published in Psychopharmacology.

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   In 1982?

A.   Right.

Q.   And this was when Victor DeNoble was still employed with Philip Morris; correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It has the same players we just saw, Lisa Carron, Victor DeNoble.

A.   Right.

Q.   There's another woman by the name of Yvonne Dragan?

A.   Right.

Q.   The title is "Behavioral Effects of Intraventricularly Administered Negative Nicotine on Fixed Ratio Schedules of Food Presentation in Rats."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Again, this is very similar, if not identical, to the research that we just discussed in one of the Philip Morris internal memos?

A.   Right.

Q.   Are you familiar with Psychopharmacology magazine?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What is it?

A.   It's a leading journal of pharmacology as it affects the brain.  It's a Springer Verlag publication.

Q. And, again, that's was another article that Dr. DeNoble published while he was employed at Philip Morris?

A.   Right.  Yeah, he's allowed to publish things that don't make it look like nicotine is addictive.

Q.   I'll hand you the next exhibit.

A.   This is a 1982 abstract from the Society For Neuroscience.

Q.   If you turn to Page 2,   the abstract says 109.7.  It's "Antagonism of Chronic Nicotine

Administration: Effects of Scheduled-Controlled Behavior in Rats."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it talks about the fixed-ratio interval schedule of food presentation for the rats?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Again, this is another article that Dr. DeNoble was able to publish while he was employed at Philip Morris?

A.   Yes, at least an abstract.

Q.   An abstract.  I'm sorry.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 34 was marked for identification.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Doctor, you have Exhibit 34 in front of you. And halfway under the page it has, "Brain Sites Involved in the Behavioral Effects on Intraventricularly Administered Nicotine."

A.   Yes.  This is an experiment with the 15 hooded rats.

Q.   And this was, if you look at the second page, an abstract that was dated -- it's hard to see -- but August of 1986.

Do you see that?

A.   I can't really tell, but it looks sort of like '86.

Q. At the bottom, I'll represent to you it was a conference or a meeting that was held on August 23rd to 2 6th, 1986 in Washington, D.C.

A.   Okay.

Q.   And this looks like an abstract that was a presentation at the 94th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association.

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the program was sponsored by Division 28 --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- Psychopharmacology?

A.   Right.

Q.   This was after DeNoble left?

A.   Yes.

Q.   He was still writing about the rat studies that he conducted at Philip Morris; correct?

A.   That's right.  With Paul Mele.

Q.   With Paul Mele.

What, in your opinion, do you believe Dr. DeNoble was barred from publishing?

A.   I think he was barred from publishing his clear evidence that acetaldehyde with nicotine produced

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

a powerful synergy that produced a powerful reinforcing effect in his rat experiments, which led them to compulsively press that lever.

So it was dramatic.  It was strong evidence for addiction.  I think that's what bothered Philip Morris.  I think that's why he got fired.

Q.   But that particular conclusion that he had after he left Philip Morris wasn't reflected in his individual memos at the time he was employed by Philip Morris, correct, based on what we've seen?

A.   Based on what we've seen so far.  I'm not sure we've seen everything, but that's what he says.  He says he was not allowed to publish this.  It was dangerous for the company, so he got fired.

Q.   All right.  15 years later he was suggesting that he wasn't allowed to publish a conclusion that was not documented, at least from what we've seen in the memos that I showed you today?

A.   I think it was maybe earlier than that, because I think '95, he started coming out.

Q.   Ten years?

A.   Right.

Q.   Ten years later?

A.   Right.

Q.   I forgot my question.

Ten years later you're suggesting that he was able to publish on a conclusion that wasn't reflected in his internal memos based on his research that he conducted while he was at Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.  Yes, sort of filling in the gaps, reconstructing it.  It seems like maybe he really didn't believe it was addictive for several years, and then as an aha moment, tried to publish it, is not allowed to, and is punished for that.

Q.   Is that your Dr. Proctor filling in the gaps?

A.   That's what it seems like.  That's what he testifies to, right?  That's what he talks about is he's the whistleblower who was, you know, victimized by Philip Morris.

Q.   Have you ever seen any internal documents by Dr. DeNoble that suggest that he came to the conclusion that there was a powerful synergy between the acetaldehyde and nicotine with these rat studies?

A.   I haven't looked one way or the other.

Q.   Okay.

A.   I think that's in his publications rather than his internal documents.

Q.   Is it your belief that Dr. DeNoble was fired from Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Would you have any reason to contradict sworn testimony by Dr. DeNoble where he was asked the question, "Were you fired by Philip Morris?" and he answers, "No"?

A.   No.  I would have to see the evidence.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 35 was marked for identification.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   I've handed you some deposition testimony --or I'm sorry -- yes, some deposition testimony of Dr. DeNoble, which was taken in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  In 1988.

Q.   1988.

A.   September 16th.

Q.   And I'll direct you to Page 67.

A.   Right.

Q.   Line 4.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.

"Q.  Were you fired by Philip

Morris?

A.  No."

A.   Right.  And he says in response to the

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

question, "How was it that you came to leave their employment?"

He says, "We were offered an exit contract, termination, which consisted of a salary for several months, and our job during that time of employment was to find another job."

So maybe this is a kind of a -- I know there's a difference between being laid off and being fired.  If you're laid off, you get severance pay.  If you're fired, you don't.

Q.   Right.

A.   So maybe he's saying he wasn't fired, he was just laid off and that allowed him to keep his gravy train going on there.  So there may be some weird magic going on there.

Q.   Are you aware --

A.   I would say just to complete that --

Q.   Sure.

A.   In the document you gave me, it goes on to talk about the conditions of his termination and his exit contract.  So, yeah, it gives some details on that. "We had an option to leave the company, immediately with a cash settlement, to stay with the company at a severely reduced employment rate, as well as a reduction in grade, or we could opt to find another job while

employed at Philip Morris, but our actual physical" -- I think he means belongings -- "beings would be moved out of the research area into a private office."

So it sounds like he was eased out and doesn't want to call it being fired.

Q.   Are you aware that Dr. DeNoble actually, upon his exit at Philip Morris, took his research and documents?

A.   I don't know details about that.  Apparently he did take enough to keep publishing on this topic, so he must have taken something.

Q.   And do you have any reason to dispute that he testified under oath that the day that the laboratory was being shut down, he and his research partner, Dr. Mele, pulled a van around back to steal some top secret documents?

A.   I don't recall that language.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 36 was marked for identification.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Doctor, I've handed you Exhibit 36.

A.   Right.

Q.   So have you seen this before?

A.   I'm not sure I have.  It's one of the reports about him speaking to children, as he does very often.

Here it looks like he's speaking at the Pinon Hills Elementary School in, I think, Nevada.

Q.   So on the second page he -- let's see what the date of this is.  This is in 2007.

A.   Yes.

Q.   So this is his recounting of what happened?

A.   Right.

Q.   And the third paragraph, at this point he said he told his partner -- and that was Dr. Mele -- to pull the van around.  And when he asked why, he said, "Because we're going to steal top secret documents."

A.   Are you on the second page?

Q.   I'm on the second page.

A.   Right.  The report is, "I went to the lab and told my partner that we had been fired."  So there he's --

Q.   He's saying --

A.   There he's calling it being fired.

Q.   In 2007 he's calling it being fired?

A.   Yes.  And he says, "I told him to pull our van around back, and when he asked why, I said, 'Because we're going to steal top secret documents.'"

It's pretty cloak and dagger stuff, huh?

Q.   So he said, "He gathered everything he could in his office.  He worked so quickly and nervously that

he broke one of his desk drawers."

A.   Right.  "He said he threw the drawer in a box, loaded the van and left."  And they took it to the United States Congress.

And he says, "his lawyer called a few weeks later and said someone had broken into his office and stolen all the evidence."  And then DeNoble says, "Years later I actually found out that our lawyer sold all the boxes back to Philip Morris."

Q.   Do you know anything about that?

A.   No.

Q.   So if what he is saying is true, that he gave his boxes over to a lawyer who sold the documents to Philip Morris, he actually didn't have any of the documents to publish this research down the road?

A.   Well, he doesn't say -- well, it's unclear what actually was stolen.  Unclear to me, anyway.

Q.   Okay.  Let's look at some of his testimony on it.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 37 was marked for identification.)

THE WITNESS:  I see he says later on in that same document "his wife had found the desk drawer he had broken and hid it away without telling him.  DeNoble said after his wife had informed him of its whereabouts,

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 174

he retrieved the drawer and in it found evidence of the experiments he had performed at Philip Morris."

And then there's another passage, "Knowing he was prohibited by law to volunteer the information, DeNoble said he drove to New Jersey and from a discreet location mailed to the FBI a photo of the secret lab he had worked in, a photo that he had found in the drawer his wife had saved.  Unwilling to give his name, DeNoble said he left his fingerprints all over the picture in hopes the FBI would track him down."

Then later, I guess, he said the FBI agents show up to his house.  He denied -- "DeNoble said he denied everything until they took him in for questioning."

He later says that he told his wife to pack up because they were going to leave after testifying under oath.  And he tells his wife, "They're going to kill us."

And then "Before they could leave, DeNoble said the phone rang.  The person on the phone was President Bill Clinton."

So you can see why they made a movie. Q.   Very sensationalist. A.   Yes. Q.   All right.  Let's look at what he said in his

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Fictum testimony about this.

A.   Oh, he also says Clinton guaranteed him Secret Service protection for his family.  "In fact, DeNoble said, two agents were already outside his house."  Okay.

Q.   I marked as Exhibit 37 Dr. DeNoble's testimony given under oath in an Engle Progeny case called "Fictum."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  And this was testimony that was given October 25, 2008.

A.   Yes.

Q.   If I can direct you to Page 31 or thereabouts.

A.   Okay.

Q.   And this where he's talking about the actual article that we were just looking at.

A.   Okay.

Q.   And the questioner is asking about it.

A.   Is this Matt Schultz?  It's some Schultz.

Q.   Let me see.

A.   Yeah.

Q.   It is Matt Schultz.

A.   Yes, from Levin Papantonio.

Q.   So he talks about what we just talked about, which was he went back with Mr. Mele and told him to pull the van back around because they're going to steal top secret documents?

A.   This is Page 31?

Q.   It's 31, 32, 33.

A.   Okay.  I see it says, "It never happened?"

Q.   And it did happen?

A.   It did happen.

Q.   He describes the truck that they decided to steal the documents with; correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   And they say that they just -- I've moved on to Page 34 -- that he took most of his stuff that was labeled "Confidential - Restricted Distribution"?

A.   Right here.  He says again, "We've been fired.  We were fired."  That's before he pulled the van around.

Q.   Right.  And really, this is just a description of what he said he stole, a couple of boxes worth; correct?

A.   Yes, right.

Q.   All right.

A.   That's on Page 34.

Q.   Up to Page 35.  He said that he took what was

A.
	Right.

Q.
	But he said he didn't take everything, that

because
	there were file cabinets that had monthly and

annual
	reports and other reports that was not important?

A.
	It was presumably a big office.

Q.
	He did take what he thought was the important

files?

A.   And then he says -- this is on Line 20 --"That never happened."

Q.   Right.

"Q.  So this statement in the article, 'DeNoble gave him all the boxes of evidence he had been keeping in his garage,' that's more for dramatic effect?" Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the answer DeNoble said was, "Yes."

A.   Right.

Q.   And the next -- and then:

"Q.  And the next paragraph, it says:  'However, DeNoble said his lawyer called a few weeks later and said someone had broken into his office and stolen all the evidence.'"

And DeNoble's answer was, "Dramatic effect" again; right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And he's saying -- his lawyer is saying: "Q.  Is that something you told the children at Hills Elementary?

A. Probably, yes.

Q.  Because that's what you tell

people when you give this speech

about what you did at Philip

Morris, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you just say that for

dramatic effect?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  But it never happened?

A.  Correct."

Do you see that? A.   Right.  Yeah.

Q.   And then it goes on and on.  "Years later," he says in this paragraph or this article the quote:

"Q. 'Years later, I actually found

out that our lawyers sold all the

boxes back to Philip Morris,' said

DeNoble.' See that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is that something you told the

kids at Hills Elementary School?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Because that's the kind of

thing you say when you give these

Q.  But that never happened, did it?

A.  Correct.

Q.  That's for dramatic effect? A.  That is correct." A.   So he's a bit overly dramatic it sounds like. Q.   Dramatic, yes.  Okay.  Do you know what Dr. DeNoble did after he left Philip Morris?

A.   Well, I know that he was sort of on this lecture circuit for children.  I know he has been doing that a long time.

Q. Sorry. Right after he left Philip Morris, do you know whether he went to work for some other company or institution?

(Luncheon recess taken from 12:09 to 1:07.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Dr. Proctor, when we broke we were talking about Dr. DeNoble.  I want to go back to -- I don't know what exhibit it is, but it's the Nevada news article where Dr. DeNoble is talking to students at Pinon Hills Elementary School. A.   Yes.

Q.   You read from that? A.   I think that's here.

Q.   Yes.  Okay.  So just kind of looking at the allegations of what was said in this article compared to his sworn testimony on the issue, I want to go back to a couple of things he said.

So on the first page, you see he says that, "In 1983, DeNoble took the results of his experiment to his bosses at Philip Morris."  And according to DeNoble,

"They were outraged that he had been performing
	
experiments on the brain.'
	

	Do you see that?

A
	Yes.

Q
	Okay.  So in his Fictum testimony, which you

also have a copy of, on Exhibit 28 a question was asked
	
of him
	on 28, Line 18.

A
	Which testimony is this?

Q
	Fictum.

A
	That's Jackson.

Q
	There.

A
	Okay.

Q
	Page 28.

A
	Yes.

Q
	Line 18.

A
	Right.

Q
	And DeNoble was asked about this particular

paragre
	iph on this exhibit where he was asked:


	"Q.  'According to DeNoble, they


	were outraged that' -- "they"


	being Philip Morris -- 'that he


	had been performing experiments on


	the brain and not working on a


	safer cigarette like they had


	hired him to do.'  You said that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  But that never happened? A.  No, that didn't happen.  The brain work we were doing then was rats." A.   Right.

Q.   And then if you go to Page 30, Line 21, this is also talking about a quote that DeNoble made in this particular Nevada article.  The question was: "Q.  And is this statement, is this one you're saying was said: 'Our decision was final:  We are not going to lose money, and if people have to die, that's the way it is'?"

DeNoble said that tobacco -- or Philip Morris executives said that to him; correct?

A.   Well, what he says is, "That's completely out of context."

Q. Right. And he said, "That's completely out of context." And then the question was, "That wasn't said?"  And he said, "No."

But according to this article, when he was speaking to the Pinon Hills Elementary School, he said that DeNoble was called into the executives offices, and

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=185
Page 186

DeNoble said that the executives told him, "Our decision is final.  We're not going to lose money."

But now he's saying in his sworn testimony that wasn't said?

A.   Well, he's also saying it was out of context. It's sort of hearsay piling on top of hearsay.

Q.   He was just in this deposition confronted with this particular article that you're looking at. And he was asked did Philip Morris executives actually say what you said this article said it says? A.   Right.

Q.   And he was asked, "That wasn't said?"  And he said, "No."

A.   Yeah.  And he says that it's out of context as well.

Q.   Well, you if go down on Page 31 it says: "Q.  Well, let's take it one at a time.  This statement; 'Our decision is final:  We're not going to lose money, and if people have to die, that's the way it is,' that was not something you said at this presentation? A.  I am not sure I said it that way, no.

Page 187

Q.  And no one at Philip Morris said that to you; right? A.  No, not like that, no." A.   That's the testimony.  And then it goes on to say, "'Philip Morris subsequently fired DeNoble.'  See that?"

And DeNoble says, "Yes."

And the question is, "But that's not true, is it?"

The answer is, "Yes, it is." "Philip Morris did fire you?" Answer, "Yes." Q.   Which is different than the testimony he gave which we looked at earlier, correct, when he was directly asked if Philip Morris fired him?

A.   Yes.  You get more the impression from that that he was laid off.

Q.   Okay.  So we already talked about how DeNoble said that he and Mele pulled up the van or truck and stole some of those documents from the lab? A.   Right.  The top secret documents. Q.   The top secret documents and --A.   The 1982 Ford van.

Q.   He was asked -- or he was asked whether --let me ask you this -- and I can't recall.  What did

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

DeNoble do with those documents?  He said he hid them and then gave them to his lawyer; right?  Do you recall that?

A.   Barely.

Q.   Okay.  But then this lawyer somehow sold the documents to Philip Morris?

A.   Back to Philip Morris.

Q.   Back to Philip Morris.  Do you recall that testimony we looked at earlier today?

A.   Sort of.

Q.   Okay.  Well, let's look at what he actually said about these documents.  On Page 48.

A.   Right.

Q.   He was actually asked on Page 46 whether he had given the stolen documents to Congress.

Do you see that on the bottom of Page 46 to

47?

A

Q impact? A Q

Right.

And he said he didn't think it would have any

Right.

And then he was asked whether -- why he didn't give all the documents to the American Heart and Lung Association on Page 48, Line 12? A.   Right.

Q.   And he said, "No reason"? A.   Right.

Q.   Okay.  And then it refers to something that was in the Pinon Hills presentations to the student on Page 49.  They quote the article as saying:

"Q.  'They found a lawyer

interested in the case, and

DeNoble gave them all the boxes of

evidence he had been keeping in

the garage.'  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And that's something you told

the children at Hills Elementary

School; right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Because that's what you tell

people when you give these

presentations about what you did

at Philip Morris; right?

A.  Yes." A.   And these yesses are all DeNoble --Q.   Yes, I'm sorry.  It says --A.   -- just to be clear.

Q.   I should say "Answer:  Yes."  And he went --and the question next is, "Who was the lawyer you found

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

that was interested in the case?"  And he's talking about the lawyer that he gave the documents to; right? A.   This is -- what page are you on now? Q.   Same page, right under it.  50, Line 6. A.   Page 50? Q.   50, Line 6. A.   Right. Q.   Okay.

"Q.  This lawyer you found was interested in the case? A.  Well, the lawyer I hired was the lawyer to try to get some compensation from Philip Morris beyond the six months' salary." A.   Right.

Q.   And it says, "Let's take this sentence here." Again, he's looking at that Nevada article.  And he said, "They found a lawyer interested?"  And answer, DeNoble is saying, "It shouldn't be they.  It should just be me."

A.   Right.

Q.   So the article was inaccurate when they said "they."  And it goes on -- I won't read it, but it goes on to say that DeNoble's lawyer sent a letter to Philip Morris saying, "You owe me money"; right?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

A.   Apparently.

Q.   And this article -- this article -- can you tell me what exhibit number it is, just so we're clear? A.   37. Q.   Okay.

A.   Sorry.  37 is the deposition.  The article is 36.

Q.   So the article, Exhibit 36, said DeNoble said he talked to his lab partner.  They both decided to take what they knew to Congress, which we just read he didn't do.  They found a lawyer interested in the case, and DeNoble gave him all the boxes he had been keeping in his garage.

Do you see that paragraph? A.   Right.  This is all in his story about him talking to the children.

Q.   Talking to children.  So when he was asked about it in sworn testimony, the question asked of him is Page 52, Line 21.  Well, let's go back up.  52, Line 16:

"Q.  Whatever lawyer you had at the time sending letters to Philip Morris saying: You owe me money? A.  Right. Q.  And you gave that lawyer all

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

these boxes?

A.  That never happened. Q.  Never happened.  So this statement here you gave him � 'DeNoble gave him all the boxes of evidence he had been keeping in his garage,' that's more for the dramatic effect? A. Yes."

And then it goes on to this article Question, on 53, Line 1:

"Q.  And then the next paragraph, it says:

'However, DeNoble said his lawyer called a few weeks later and said someone had broken into his office and stolen all the evidence.

A.  Dramatic effect.

Q.  Well, is that sentence, is that something you tell -- is that something you told the children at Hills Elementary?

A.  Probably, yes.

Q.  Because that's what you tell people when you give this speech

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

about what you did at Philip Morris; right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you just say that for dramatic effect?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  But it never happened?

A.  Correct." MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   And then you go on on Page 53, do you see on Line 18?

A.   Yes. Q.   Okay.

"Q.  And then this next paragraph -- again, we're talking about Exhibit 36 -- it says:  'Years later, I actually found out that our lawyers sold all the boxes back to Philip Morris,' said DeNoble.'  See that? A.  Yes.

Q.  Is that something you told the kids at Hills Elementary School? A.  Yes.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Q.  Because that's the kind of

thing that you say when you give

these speeches about what you did

at Philip Morris?

A.  Yes.

Q.  But that never happened, did

it?

A.  Correct.

Q.  That's for dramatic effect?

A.  That is correct."

Did I read that correctly? A.   Yes.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   If we can skip to Page 71 of the transcript, Dr. Proctor.

A.   Yes.

Q.   And if you recall, before lunch we were talking about how this particular article, Exhibit 36, DeNoble recounted that he drove to New Jersey, from a discreet location, mailed to the FBI a photo of the secret lab he worked on, and he left fingerprints all over the pictures in hopes that the FBI would track him down.

Do you recall that?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=194
Page 195

A.   Yes.

Q.   So this is testimony that he gave under oath regarding that particular paragraph. A.   Right. Q.   Page 71, he was asked:

"Q.  And how did you decide what to send to the FBI? A.  I just sent one picture of a rat in a self-administration box. Q.  So you've got one picture of a rat in a self-administration box? A.  Yes."

And then if you recall, DeNoble said in the article that a few days later, agents showed up to his house.  DeNoble said he denied everything, until they took him in for questioning.

And so if we look at that testimony on Page 75, Line 1. A.   Yes.

Q.   He was asked whether that actually happened. He said, Yes, "but not from the FBI."  And so the question is:

"Q.  Okay.  So that's what I want to make sure I understand.  You've mailed this letter from a discreet

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

location with a photo of your rat

in a chamber.  And a few days,

agents show up at your house;

right?

A.  That's right.  Actually they

met me at a hotel in Delaware.

Q.  What do you tell the kids?

Did you tell them they showed up

at your house?

A. Probably.

Q.  But that's for dramatic

effect?

A.  Yes."

Did I read that correctly? A.   Yes.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   So this goes on.  "They wanted to meet you at a hotel."  And he was asked on Page 76 whether this meeting had anything to do with the picture that he sent in.  And on Page 77 he answers, "Not at all."  77/2:

"Q.  Not at all?  This is because

Henningfield called them?

A.  This is correct.

Q.  When you tell this story to

children, or when you give these

speeches about what you did at

Philip Morris, do you say that,

'Well, it wasn't because I sent

anything in, it was because Jack

Henningfield called and talked to

me? '

A.  No, I don't.  Just way too

much time.

Q. Too much time to tell them

that's the way it really happened?

A.  The whole story, yes.  I

wouldn't be able to get it in in

45 minutes." A.   Right.  He's talking to a bunch of children.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   But he's also saying when you do these other speeches to other people about what you did at Philip Morris.

A.   Right.

Q.   Have you heard that from Dr. DeNoble personally?

A.   Heard what?

Q.   That the FBI called him because of this photo

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 198

that he sent that he left his fingerprints all over in hopes the FBI would call him?

A.   No.

Q. Okay. And then in the article, it goes on to say, "In front of a judge, DeNoble was sworn under oath to divulge what he knew."

A. What page is that? I'm sorry. That's in the article?

Q.   Yes.  I'm just reading from the article.

A.   Right.

Q. And "DeNoble says, 'What does that oath mean, he asked the judge.

"'It means you have to tell the truth,' DeNoble said the judge said.'"

That was in the article.  Let's see what he said in his sworn testimony.  Page 78.

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so the question was:  "Let's read the next part of the story here," and it has what I just read about the in front of the judge he was asked what the oath meant.  And it said, "That all happened?" the question to DeNoble.  And DeNoble's answer was, "No, dramatic effect."

"Q.  So you weren't taken in front of a judge and none of this is

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

true?

A. Uh-uh.

Q.  Is that right?

A.  Correct."

Do you see that? A.   Well, yeah.  It's ambiguous what "none of this is true" means.  It means just that little story about the judge, I think.

Q.   Right.  The question asked him about that particular passage. A.   Right.

Q.   I just didn't read it again.  But it was talking about whether he was in front of a judge, whether a judge said, "You were sworn to tell the truth under oath," and DeNoble  was purported to say, "What does the oath mean?"  And the judge purportedly said, "It means you have to tell the truth."

And DeNoble is now saying that never happened; right?

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form.

THE WITNESS:  Well, he's calling it dramatic effect. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   But he was asked:

"Q.  None of this is true?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

A.  Correct." A.   Well, yeah, none of that --

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form.

THE WITNESS:  -- sentence apparently was true, apparently. BY MS. CHUANG: Q.   Okay.

A.   It was kind of hearsay on top of hearsay Q.   On Page 79, again he was asked about the statement that he was -- the question was:

"Q.  This statement that I just

read here, that you were taken

before a judge and gave a

statement on the record and asked

what the oath meant, and the judge

said tell the truth, none of that

ever happened, did it?

A.  I think I just said that.

happen?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  But this is what you told the

kids at Hills Elementary?

	A.  Yes."

A.
	Right.

Q.
	And question:


	"Q.  And because that's what you

	give these speeches on what you


	did at Philip Morris?

BY MS. CHUANG:
	
Q.
	I read that correctly?

A.
	You did.

Q.
	And then in this particular article,

Exhibit
	36, I think you also read this into the record

about how DeNoble said after he testified under oath, he
	
raced home and told him wife to pack up because they
	
were going to -- I can't read that word -- leave, I
	
think.
	And then the quote -- it has a quote in this

article
	r   "'They're going to kill us,' he said he told

his wife."
	

	And then he said, "Before they could leave,

DeNoble
	said the phone rang.  The person on the phone:

President Bill Clinton, DeNoble said."
	

	Do you remember reading that to me?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Let's look at his sworn testimony, Page 82, Line 25.  He was asked the question:

"Q.  And you tell her, 'They're

going to kill us?'

A.  That was the thought that

crossed my mind.

Q.  No, that's what you said.  You

told your wife, 'They're going to

kill us.'

Q.   Okay.  I think we've done enough with this. So prior to Dr. DeNoble testifying before Congress, are you aware that he swore under oath that it was not a correct statement to say that nicotine was not addictive?

A.   There were a lot of nots in that.

Q.   Okay.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  I think that's something somebody put in the LSAT, lots of nots. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   I know.

A.   You try to figure it out.

Q.   Let me ask you this, see if I can have a cleaner statement.

Are you aware that Dr. DeNoble testified before he -- before he was fired from DuPont and before he testified in front of Congress, he swore under oath there was no evidence that nicotine produces physiological dependence?

A.   No.  I didn't know that.

Q.   Right.  I only have the redacted as well. But whatever I read of it was accurate?

A.   Well, it's --

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  It's what the words on the page say. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Okay.

A.   But, again, the first part of the sentence is omitted.

Q.   If you go on on that page, and there's a redacted portion of the question.  Page 201, Line 5, Dr. DeNoble testified under oath when he's asked the question, "Isn't it true you swore under oath that tolerance that developed from nicotine was primarily behavioral?"

And I acknowledge there's a redacted portion, but his answer is, "I believe that is correct?"

A.   Well, he's agreeing to something.  We can't even tell what he's agreeing to because the whole thing is redacted.

Q.   The whole thing is not redacted.  It's asking whether he swore under oath that tolerance that was developed from nicotine was primarily behavioral. A.   Well, that's the sentence fragment --MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  That's the sentence fragment. But the two lines before that are redacted.  So we don't really know what he's agreeing to. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Okay.  If you go to Page 201 --A.   Why would this be redacted?  It's odd.  Okay. 201.

"Q.  And you swore under oath that tolerance to a chemical doesn't mean you're addicted to it; right? A.  That's correct." Did I read that correctly? A.   Yes.

A.   Wow.  Giant chunks redacted. Q.   Yes.  I have to bring the unredacted next time, if it's appropriate.

On Page 220 after the redactions he was asked -- DeNoble was asked a question:

"Q.  But after April 1994, after you testified in front of Congress that nicotine is addictive -- for the first time; right? A.  (Nods head.) Q.  Is that right? A.  Right."

So it is sounds like the first time he said nicotine was addictive was after April 1994? A.   Possibly.

Q.   Yes.  Okay.  You will be happy to know I'm done with DeNoble. A.   Yes.

Q.   I want to jump around to other topics, if I could.

You were recently asked, I think, by Mr. Riley about a new E-cigarette brand called Juul? A.   Yes.

Q.   And do you know who developed the Juul? A.   I think it was a San Francisco company.

There was a Stanford connection --

Q.   Yes.

A.   --a couple years ago.

Q.   The concept of Juul was actually developed by two Stanford grad students?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you know James Monsees, M-o-n-s-e-e-s?

A.   Not very well.  They may have been some of the people who came to my office about five years ago. But maybe that was a different company.  I'm not sure.

Q.   There's another individual by the name of Adam Bowen.

Does that ring a bell?

A.   Not really.

Q.   Okay.  And you said a company came to your office five years ago?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Tell me about that.

A.   It was one of these early electronic cigarette companies wanting to get my endorsement, something like that.

Q.   You don't recall the name?

A.   Yes.  It may have been this one or it may have been another one.

Q.   Do you remember any names of individuals that

A.       No.  It was just one person.

Q.       It was just one person?

A.       Yes.

Q.       And did he attend Stanford?

A.       I have a vague memory that it was from the

business   school or design school, something like that.

Q.       Do you remember the name of the particular

company? A

Q A

Q A

Q A

No.

And you said they asked for your endorsement? Something like that. What happened?

I don't think anything happened. Were you willing to endorse them? Not really.  I generally don't, you know, endorse products.

Q.   Why did they want your endorsement? A.   I think they were going around and trying to get tobacco control people to buy in to a safer cigarette.

Q.   Do you know what happened to this company? A.   No.  If it was Juul, I know what happened to it.  But if it wasn't, I don't.

A.   I don't.

Q.   Were you consulted at all on the Juul?

A.   No.

Q.   Do you know what Juul stands for?

A.   No.  I mean it has a Scandinavian vibe, but I don't know what the particular letters stand for.

Q.   The Juul Web site states that Mr. Monsees and Mr. Bowen met as graduates in the Stanford Design Lab.

A.   That's what I heard.

Q.   What is the Stanford Design Lab?

A.   Just one of our facilities for designing consumer products.

Q.   Would this have been the place where they begin their design of -- this alternative design?

A.   I don't know.  Could be.

Q.   It could have been a place where they tried to --

A.   It's possible.

Q.   Do you have any knowledge of any kind of E-cigarette products or cigarette alternatives that are being or have been designed at Stanford?

A.   Well, apart from Juul, no.  Juul, by the way, is J-u-u-1.

Q.   Have you tried Juul?

A. I have not. I have lots of students who have.

Q.   Do you have an opinion as to whether this product is a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes?

A.   Yes.  I think it's definitely less deadly than cigarettes on a per-gram-of-vapor-delivered basis.

Q.   Is this something you've looked into at all?

A. Not specifically that company. But I've looked into electronic cigarettes more generally.

question, but Ted Koppel on Page 23 had directed a question to Mr. Parrish about cigarettes and the deaths by lung cancer.

A.   Right.

Q.   And then Steve Parrish responds, if you see, "Ted, we do not say there is no evidence.  There clearly is evidence that links cigarette smoking with lung cancer and other diseases.  We don't deny that cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer and other diseases."

Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And that's what Mr. Parrish said on this Nightline ABC news report in 1990?

A.   Yes.  That's when Philip Morris was shifting over to risk language to avoid having to admit causation.

Q.   At this point in time, they were telling the American public that cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer and other diseases?

A.   Occasionally.  But they were using that language in order to maintain the line that it did not cause a cancer.  You see a version of that even from

Anne Browder from the '80s.  You know, she said, "We do not deny that cigarettes may be a risk factor for some people with the diseases they suffer, but that doesn't mean we say it causes disease."

Q.   I see.

A.   Risk is used as the alternative to causation.

Q.   I understand that.  And I know you want to make that distinction.

All I want to confirm is at least by 1990, Philip Morris was publicly acknowledging that cigarette smoking was a risk factor for lung cancer and other diseases?

A.   That's not exactly right.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  They didn't deny it, but they didn't -- here, they didn't affirm it.  There's an important distinction. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   But here they are telling the public, "We don't deny it"?

A.   Right.  But that's different from -- you asked me did they admit it or did they affirm it.

And the answer is no, they didn't deny it.

Q.   I didn't ask if they admitted it.  I asked --

A.   Yes, you did, actually.

Q.   --if they publicly acknowledged?

A.   If you go back and read your question.  I was very careful to listen to you.  You asked here they are admitting, and I said no, they're not denying.  And there is a distinction.

Q.   Well, let me ask you this.  I'll rephrase it if I said that.

At this point in time in 1990, Philip Morris is acknowledging that cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer and other diseases?

A.   Well, I think actually they're just not denying it.  They're not acknowledging it.

Q.   Okay.  We'll use your --

A.   There's a big difference.

Q.   We'll use your term then.

At this point in 1990, Philip Morris is not denying that cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer and other diseases?

A.   Well, just to be absolutely technically correct, what he's saying is we don't deny that cigarette smoking is a risk factor.  That's what he's saying.  He's claiming --

Q.   Correct.

A.   -- not to be denying it.  He's not admitting it.  He's claiming not to deny it.

Q.   Right.  So I think we're saying the same thing.  My question was:  In 1990 Philip Morris was not denying that cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer and other diseases?

A.   Right.  At least sometimes they were not denying it.  They may well have sometimes been denying it.  But here in this particular passage, he's claiming not to be denying it.

Q.   In 1990, as of June, what evidence do you have that Philip Morris was still denying that cigarette smoking was not a risk factor?  I know that has a lot of negatives.

A.   It does, but sort of maybe I think to cut to the thrust of your question, if you go to even the Waxman hearings, they say, "We don't believe it causes cancer," right?  So that's kind of an example of what you're asking for.  And if you look at various depositions, Geoffrey Bible and other people, they're still not admitting.

But, okay, if your question is strictly speaking about denial, it's true that there's less often denial by this time.  But they're still using this strategy of distraction in this direction.  I mean, after all, much of the denial campaign is a distraction campaign.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

The other answer to your question is the Tobacco Institute was still producing misinformation into the 1990s.  So that would be another example where Philip Morris indirectly through the Tobacco Institute is issuing denials.

But, again, much of the denial campaign is about:  We need more evidence.  We want more proof. There's an open controversy.  There's two sides.  So throughout the conspiracy, there are subtle ways to deny by distracting, deny by claiming an open controversy, deny by claiming we need more research.  So that kind of subtle form of distraction penetrates the entire conspiracy.

Q.   And I'm not speaking about subtle distractions.  What I am speaking of is what Steve Parrish told the American public in 1990 about Philip Morris's position, which is:  We don't deny that cigarette smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer and other disease.

A.   That's a direct quote.

Q.   And that's what he told the American public on ABC in 1990?

A.   Yes.  Throughout that interview, of course, he's denying by questioning whether secondhand smoke causes harm.  He talks about little wisps of smoke.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

He's emphasizing indoor air quality.  Really, most of the discussion is about secondhand smoke.

MS. CHUANG:  Move to strike.  There was no question pending. BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Doctor, I'm going to hand you what's been marked as Exhibit 42.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 42 was marked for identification.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Do you see that?  And this is the Philip Morris Company, Inc. Annual Report.

A.   Yes.  From 1990.

Q.   From 1990.  And if you look at Page 3 --

A.   On the financial highlights?

Q.   I'm sorry.  "Dear stockholder:"  Starting at the letter.  It says, "Dear Stockholder:"

A.   Okay.  By Hamish Maxwell.

Q.   Yes.

A.   Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.

Q.   Right.  And he's writing to the stockholders of Philip Morris.

A.   Right.  It's looks like it's a public document.

Q.   And in this letter or this annual report, I should say, and this forward to the stockholders under Social and Legislative Issues --

A.   Yes.

Q.   --do you see that?

A.   Yes, on the second page.

Q.   And Hamish Maxwell is telling his stockholders, "We have acknowledged that smoking is a risk factor in the development of lung cancer and certain other human diseases, because a statistical relationship exists between smoking and the occurrence of those diseases."

A.   Right.

Q.   Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yes.  That's right about when that new language of risk comes in, right around 1990.

Q.   And they he goes on to say, "We believe that smokers around the world are well aware of the potential risks associated with tobacco use and have the knowledge necessary to make an informed decision." Did I read that correctly?

A. Right. So even though he did not admit that cigarettes cause any harm whatsoever, he's nonetheless saying that ordinarily smokers have enough information to make an informed decision.

Q.   I'm not sure it's accurate to say that Mr. Maxwell is not acknowledging any danger.

A.   Well, he doesn't admit any danger.  He simply calls it a risk factor.

Q.   He calls smoking a risk factor.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Let me hand you what I'll mark as Exhibit 43. (Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 43 was marked for identification.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Do you recognize this?

A.   Yes.

Q.   This is what is sometimes known as the Hatch statement?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it says this is Philip Morris's statement of position?

A.   Yes.  From October 2, 1997.  It's Bates 2060567843.

Q.   And according to this particular document, under Causation it states, "We recognize that there is a substantial body of evidence which supports the judgment that cigarette smoking plays a causal role in the development of lung cancer and other diseases in smokers.  We previously have acknowledged that the

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

strong statistical association between smoking and certain diseases, such as lung cancer and emphysema establishes that smoking is a risk factor for and, in fact, may be a cause of those diseases."

A.   "May be a cause of those diseases."

Q.   And it goes on in the second paragraph, "Despite the differences that may exist between our views and those of the public health community, in order to ensure that there will be a single, consistent public health message on this issue, we will refrain from debating the issue other than as necessary to defend ourselves and our opinions in the courts and other forums in which we are required to do so." Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yes.  That's the beginning of societal alignment.

Q.   And then regarding addiction, "We recognize that nicotine, as found in cigarette smoke, has mild pharmacological effects, and that, under some definitions, cigarette smoking is 'addictive.'" And that's in quotes?

A.   Yes.  "Addictive" is in quotes.

Q.   "The word 'addiction' has been and is currently used differently by different people in different contexts, and the definition of that term has

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

undergone significant changes over the past several decades."

A.   Yes.

Q.   It then goes on a couple of sentences later, "We have not embraced those definitions of 'addiction' which do not include historically accepted and objective criteria, such as intoxication and physical withdrawal, as important markers."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yeah.  That's how they are continuing the denial campaign.

Q.   It goes on to say, "We acknowledge that our views are at odds with those of the public health community, but in the last analysis there is little point to a continuing public debate about the definition of a word used both colloquially and technically to describe many different kinds of behavior."

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   And then it says, "We will refrain from debating the issue other than as necessary to defend ourselves and our opinions in the courts and other forums in which we are required to do so, and we will also defer to the judgment of the public health authorities as to what health warning messages concerning addiction will best serve the public

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   I'm going to switch topics.  I want to talk about the Philip Morris Web site, philipmorrisusa.com?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Are you familiar with that?

A.   A little, although I don't go to it very often.

Q.   Have you been on it?

A.   Probably once or twice.

Q.   Why did you go on the Web site once or twice?

A.   I don't recall.  It's hard to find.

Q.   It's hard to find philipmorrisusa.com?

A.   It is, yeah.  I mean, if you search "Philip Morris," it might take you a while to find it.  That was my experience.  The industry Web sites are all hard to find.

Q.   Are you aware that the industry Web sites are clearly labeled on cigarette packages?

A.   The Web sites are, yes.

Q.   And this is a Web site, the Philip Morris Web site?

A.   Yes.  If you do a search "Philip Morris," I'm

not sure that's what you'd come up with.

Q.   Do you know when this Web site came into existence?

A.   I thought it was the late '90s.

Q.   Other than getting on the Web site one or two times,   have you conducted any research concerning this Web site?

A.   No.

Q.   Have you studied what kind of information is contained on this Web site?

A.   Not really.

Q.   Or how many people visit the Web site?

A.   I've seen reports that not many people visit it, but I haven't done that research myself.

Q.   What reports have you seen?

A.   There have been a number.  I'm not very familiar with them.  But occasionally I see studies that people don't visit these Web sites very often.

Q.   What studies are you referring to?

A.   I think there have been a couple in Tobacco Control.

Q.   Can you identify for me the names?

A.   No.

Q.   The authors?

A.   No.

Q.   Where I can find them?

A.   Well, it's not hard to find if you just look up Tobacco Control.

Q.   And Web sites?

A.   Web sites of Reynolds.  The studies, I recall, are more prominent for Reynolds.

Q.   You say not very many people visit the Web site?

A.   Yes.

Q.   About how many people visit the Web sites?

A.   Well, for the Reynolds one, it was very few. It was just a handful in any given year.  I think it may have gone up since those studies.  It's not important as a source of information or noninformation.

Q.   What year were these studies that you saw?

A.   In the past four or five years.

Q.   From 2014?

A.   Something like that.

Q.   And when you say for R. J. Reynolds it's just a handful, what is your definition of "a handful"?

A.   I remember it was single digit per month or something like that.

Q.   Less than ten people?

A.   It was something like that, yes.  Then it went up a little bit, but it was just a handful.

Q.   And for Philip Morris, philipmorrisusa.com, what did these reports say about the number of visits?

A.   I remember it was also small, but I don't remember the number.

Q.   Was it single digit as well?

A.   I don't recall.

Q.   What's your definition of "small"?

A.   It wasn't thousands.

Q.   It was not thousands?

A.   Not according to these reports.  I mean, why would people go to these Web sites?

Q.   You recently testified that visits to the Philip Morris USA Web site is not a huge number. Do you recall that testimony?

A.   No.  But I think that's correct.

Q.   What is your definition of a "huge number"?

A.   Well, if hundreds of thousands of people were visiting it, that would be, I think, a pretty huge number.  But it's much smaller than that.

Q.   Do you think if hundreds of thousands of people have visited philipmorrisusa.com, that would be significant?

A.   Well, it would be a larger number than is presently true.

Q.   Sure.  But of course --

A.   I think it would be more significant than --I mean, I think SRITA, I think we've had 5 million visitors, something like that.  I don't think there have been 5 million visitors to any of the major tobacco company Web sites.

Q.   What did you say?

A.   SRITA, the Stanford Research into Tobacco Advertising.  A lot of people visit that.

Q.   So they've had about 5 million hits?

A.   That's what I recall, yeah.

Q.   So if philipmorrisusa.com had more than 5 million hits, that would be significant, in your mind?

A.   Yes.  I would be surprised.  I'd wonder why they're going to these boring Web sites.

Q. Have you ever personally ran some analytical program in which you could see how many people visited the PM-USA Web site?

A.   No.  And that's something other people have done.

Q.   And so when you offered the opinion or testimony that it's not a huge number, the number of people that visit Philip Morris USA, what steps did you take to verify that it's not a huge number?

A.   Well, I didn't verify that after I said it. I said it because I had seen that evidence.

Q.   You've seen the articles that you referred me to?

A.   People have studied them over time and shown that they're kind of a formality.

Q.   Would it surprise you to know that Philip Morris USA has had more than 5 million hits?

A.   Yes.  And I probably wouldn't even believe it unless it was in a peer-reviewed literature, because Philip Morris could easily bump that figure up.

Q.   You're familiar that there are programs out that will generate or tell you how many people visit your particular Web site; right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And there are verified programs such as Google Analytics?

A.   There are, yes.

Q.   Do you find Google Analytics to be a reputable program?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So if Google Analytics ran a report and suggested that more than 5 million people did visit philipmorrisusa.com --

A.   I'd be surprised.

Q.   -- you would be surprised?

A.   Yes.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Q.   Okay.

A.   And puzzled.

Q.   Why would you be puzzled?

A.   Because I'd wonder why would people be going to Philip Morris to find out that information.  We already know from multiple sources that I'm confronted with in every trial that Philip Morris is not viewed as a reliable source of information.  So why would so many people be going to that Web site.

Again, I would be particularly surprised given that some of these other Web sites have such tiny numbers, but I'm happy to see --

Q.   Which one are you talking about?

A.   I'm talking about that earlier study I was talking about that showed such a tiny number of visitors to Reynolds' Web site.

Q.   I see.  I'm going to stick with the Web site. You testified in a prior trial that, "The tobacco industry gives a list of additives and ingredients on their Web site except for some of the additives, I think, the papers, the inks and the glues."

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you recall that testimony?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What research have you done to verify this

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

particular opinion that you gave?

A.   Well, when I looked at the ingredients lists that are provided, I haven't seen the inks or some of the other constituents reported.

Q.   When you say you looked at various ingredients lists, what are these ingredients lists?

A.   Well, some are on Philip Morris's Web site. Then there's the more general, you know, class of compounds that was provided in 1986 to the federal health authorities.  That's sort of the master list.

Q.   Have you gone on to Philip Morris USA's Web site to look up exactly what Philip Morris does disclose about additives and ingredients?

A.   I've seen it from time to time, yes.

Q.   When is the last time you've seen it?

A.   It's been probably a couple of years.

Q.   Before you rendered this opinion at trial, did you go and verify and confirm that papers, inks and glues weren't included on the list of ingredients that the tobacco company discloses on its Web site to the public?

A.   Well, not as a deliberate separate project, but I have not seen that on their Web sites.

Q.   And you agree with me that as an expert witness, you would want to be as accurate as possible

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it says, "We have grouped the list of non-tobacco ingredients in all Philip Morris USA cigarette products in the following six categories:"  It talks about cigarette papers, side-seam adhesives, monogram inks, filtration materials, filter papers, including plug wraps, tipping papers and tipping paper inks, and filter adhesives. Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So it does talk about the papers and it does talk about the inks and it does talk about the glues?

A.   Apparently, yeah, as of last August.

Q.   Okay.

A.   I don't know when that started.

Q.   And if the public signs on to the Philip Morris Cigarette Non-Tobacco Ingredients, they can look at the Web site to see the percentage in a cigarette of each of these nontobacco ingredients?

A.   Well, the quantity not exceeded 5 percent.

Q.   Percent in cigarettes?

A.   Quantity not exceeded.  That's how it's defined.

Q.   Okay.  That's fine.  But the public -- in any event, whatever it is, the public can see the

ingredients and the quantity not exceeded used in the cigarettes; correct?

A.   Yes.  These are all deliberate ingredients, not the inadvertent ones, the pesticides and whatever.

Q.   I agree.  But what we're talking about --

A.   Thank you.

Q.   --is papers, inks and glues --

A.   I'm glad you agree with my testimony.

Q.   I don't agree with that.

What I want to do is focus on your testimony about the inks, papers and glues.

A.   Among other things.

Q.   And that is, as of 8/24/2017, disclosed on the Philip Morris Web site; correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I'm going to switch topics again -- well, let me just finish with that.

At this point, it would be inaccurate for you to testify as you did before that the tobacco industry doesn't give a list of ingredients or additives such as papers, inks and glues; correct?

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  Well, as of August, that's true, so long as we restrict it to deliberate additives, because there are also inadvertent additives that get

added that are not disclosed --BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   And I'm not --

A.   -- because there are lots of fumigants and pesticides and things like that that get into the cigarette.

Q.   My question --

A.   But as to those specific categories, yes.

Q.   That was my question.  It was limited to your prior testimony, which I think we agree is now inaccurate, that the tobacco industry does not give a list of the additives with respect to papers, inks and glues?

A.   Now they list the deliberate additives, that's true.

Q.   I'm going to switch topics.

You testified in the past -- maybe I'll mark this so you can see your testimony.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 45 was marked for identification.) BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   This is, Doctor, testimony from the Sheffield case.

Do you recall that case?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It was given on May 4, 2017?

A.   That's right.

Q.   I just want to ask you about one of the opinions that you gave in this case.  It was on the topic of Dow Chemical.

A.   Yes.

Q.   On Page 2322 --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- you were talking about what Philip Morris did about boycotting Dow Chemical, and you made the statement, "And it's actually one of several boycotts of this sort that they quietly did."

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What are you referring to when you are talking about one of several boycotts?

A.   Well, I guess the two most important ones would be the Alcan boycott by the Canadian tobacco manufacturers and the pressure put on Sears because of Allstate's effort to offer a nonsmoker's discount for life insurance.  Those are two examples.

Q.   And this Alcan example that you gave, this was something that involved Canadian tobacco manufacturers ?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It didn't involve Philip Morris USA?

A.   Well, Philip Morris owns one of the largest tobacco companies in Canada.

Q.   In Canada?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So is it your testimony they were involved? Did they own --

A.   At that time --

Q.   -- that company at that time?

A.   I don't think they did at that time.  But they're all kind of behaving the same, so it doesn't really matter from a moral point of view.

Q.   I won't strike that but --

A.   My only point is I'm speaking just as someone who understands the tobacco industry, not whether they're party to a lawsuit.

Q.   I understand.  But what I'd like to know is do you have any other Philip Morris examples of boycotts that you were testifying about in this particular trial. And you've talked about the Alcon and then the Sears, which was an Allstate effort?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was Philip Morris involved in that?

A.   Well, as I recall -- it's been awhile since

I've looked at that, but I think that was through the Tobacco Institute.  So it would have been on behalf of the whole industry.

Q.   Tell me the details about that.

A.   It's been awhile, but there was some type of pressure put on Sears to get Allstate to stop its discount for nonsmokers for life insurance.  This is in the late '70s, early '80s period.  And it's not hard to find the document on that.  If just look up Allstate and Sears, and there's correspondence at high levels, you know:  Why were you offering this discount?

Q.   Where would I look this up?  On the --

A.   Where you find everything.  In the Legacy archives.

Q.   In the Legacy archives.

Do you know anything else about this boycott?

A.   Well, I fit it into the general context of the history of the life insurers offering discounts for nonsmokers.  That's the rubric under which I discovered it, is under a general project on that.  That's one of the main things I look at, the industry of life insurance companies offering discounts for nonsmokers.

Q.   What do you believe TI's involvement in that was?

A.   Well, I just remember they were pressuring

Sears.  I don't remember details about that.

Q.   Is there a document that suggests that?

A.   Well, that's where I got it, yes.

Q.   Okay.

A.   I didn't make it up out of my head.  I found it in the archives, although they wouldn't know about it.

Q.   Is that something you've retained, you have a copy of?

A.   I don't retain documents in general.  But, again, you could find it pretty easily by searching that.

Q.   Okay.  I think you have in the past testified about the Merrill Dow newsletter --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- called The Smoking Cessation Newsletter?

A.   Right.  It was shut down after only one

issue.

Shut down after one issue?

Yes.

Do you know what year it was shut down?

No.

I'm sorry.  '81.  Sorry.

Q.

A.
	It couldn't have been -- I could be a year

off, but
	not ten years.

Q.
	Sorry.  And you said it was shut down after

one --
	

A.
	One edition.

Q.
	One edition?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Have you seen more than one edition of the

A.
	No.

BY MS. CHUANG:
	
Q.
	Doctor, I've handed to you a copy of The

Smoking
	Cessation Newsletter.


	Do you see that?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	And it says, "Volume I, Number 2"?

A.
	Right.

Q.   Have you seen Volume I, Number 1?

A.   I think I looked at all of them.

Q.   It looks like it was the second one of the newsletter; correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you said it was shut down after one.

Do you know if this one was ever published?

A.   I don't.

Q.   Did you know of its existence before we were sitting here today?

A.   I don't think so.  I mean, unless I'm mistaken -- and maybe it was shut down after one year. But I remember a document saying it was shut down after one issue.  And Philip Morris bragged about it being shut down or talks about it.  That was part of our success, is getting it shut down.

Q.   Have you seen any newsletters past 1981?

A.   No.

Q.   When did the Nicorette gum therapy come out?

A.   Well, originally it comes out in Sweden in the late '70s.  And then the Merrill Dow pharmaceutical company acquires the license to produce it in the United States, and then it comes out, I think, around '84 or something like a that.

Q.   1984?

A.   Something like that.

Q.   Four years after these newsletters?

A.   Something like that.  I don't remember the exact date.  I guess it had to get FDA approval.

Q.   There's no -- sitting here today, looking at that, there's no mention of the Nicorette gum therapy in that particular issue, is there?

A.   I don't see any.

Q.   Okay.  Let me give you the Number 1 issue, if I could.

(Whereupon, Defendants' Exhibit 47 was marked for identification.)

THE WITNESS:  This? BY MS. CHUANG:

Q.   Yes.  I marked that as Exhibit 47.  You will see this is Volume 1, Number 1?

A.   Yes.

Q.   In 1981?

A.   Right.

Q.   Have you seen this particular newsletter?

A.   I think I have, yeah.

Q.   Okay.  So this is the one you saw?

A.   I think so.

Q.   And then we marked Number 2, and you have that as an exhibit.

And you haven't seen any other newsletters?

A.   I don't think so.

Q.   Is there any mention in this particular 1981 newsletter about Nicorette gum?

A.   I don't think so.

Q.   Okay.

A.   Right.

Q.   Okay.  How long have we been going?  Do we need a break?

A.   I'm fine.  Are we done with this topic?

Q.   We are done.

A.   So what it must be is that The Smoking Cessation Newsletter was stopped one issue after Nicorette gum starts being mentioned.  That must be what it is.  That's my present hypothesis.

Q.   I don't understand your hypothesis.  What are you saying?

A.   Well, because my understanding was that there was some more direct connection.  But since there's no mention of Nicorette gum here, it must be that it's just the objectionable nature of Merrill Dow pushing smoking cessation in general that's causing Philip Morris to pressure them.

Q.   I understand.  So it's the pressure in general,   not pushing of a Nicorette gum?

A.
	Yeah.
	

Q.
	Okay.  Because what you just said, the
	
Nicorette
	gum didn't comes out until '84?
	
A.
	I think that's right.
	So I'm going to have

to sort of refine that opinion a
		little bit.

	Okay.

	Do you know what that
	is?

A.
	I do.
	

Q.
	Okay.  What I want to

A.   Okay.

Q.   So I've handed you the Directory of Ongoing Research in Smoking and Health from 1967.

A.   Right.

Q.   So what I'd like to do is just go through it and count up the number of CTR-funded projects.

A.   Okay.

Q.   So it starts on Page 14, all the research projects.

A.   Right.

Q.   So we have Number 22?

A.   Um-hum.

Q.   55; correct?

A.   You can just give me the number and I'll tell you whether I agree or not.

Q.   22, 55, 77, 100, 130, 133, 134, 148, 149, 151, 152, 162, 185, 208, 214, 220, 232, 243, 250, 253, 256, 257, 308, 318, 319, 322 and 333. You're going to trust me?

A.   Yes, I trust you.

Q.   Do you agree there are 28 CTR-funded research projects listed in this 1967 Office on Smoking and Health directory?

A.   I would not dispute that.

A.   You can just give me the number, if you like, of your conclusion for the next year.

Q.   There's an index, though.  You can actually look at the index.

Q.   Exhibit 49.

A.   Yes.

Q.   1968 directory.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  I have 40 CTR-funded research projects.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you agree with that?

A.   I would agree with that.

Q.   Okay.

A.   Again, I will give it a very different interpretation from what you would, just to let you know my trial opinion.

Q.   Sure.

A.   I view that as a measure of the corruption of the federal government rather than a measure of the nobility of the cigarette makers.

Q.   Just so we have it on the record, tell me

your opinion on the issue of CTR funding 40 research projects on smoking and health in 1968.

A.   Well, the whole point of the CTR was to distract from the fact of cigarettes causing harm.  The fact that even the Office on Smoking and Health considered those papers to be worthy of including in a directory shows me how powerful the industry was in getting their message into the federal government.

Q.   Okay.  I'm going to hand you Exhibit 50, which is the 1970 directory.

Q.   Then in the 1984 to '85 directory, Doctor, would you agree that there are 35 CTR-funded research projects?

A.   If you say so.  I would trust you.

Q. Well, I don't want you to trust me. If you want to look on Page 548 --

A.   I don't.

Q.   Okay.

A.   I believe you.

Q.   You agree with that?

A.   Well, not only do I agree with it, I've published a lot on this massive denial of the enterprise, a key aspect of it being the CTR research that's heavily cited by federal authorities and a lot of other people.

Q.   And would you agree with me tallying up the numbers that we've just discussed today that from 1967 to 1985, there were reports of 357 CTR-funded research projects?

A. Yeah, I would think it would be higher than that, actually. But that's sounds about right if you counted them.  Did you say 150?

Q.   350.

A.   Yes, that sounds more like it.

Q.   What students do you have studying this?

A.   Well, I have one student who was a graduate student working on this.

Q.   A graduate student at Stanford?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is it a woman or a man?

A.   It's a man.

Q.   Does he take graduate classes from you?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Which classes is he taking from you?

A.   Well, he's taken all of my tobacco classes, my History of Ignorance, my Advanced Agnotology.  He was a TA for me in my World History of Science.

Q.   What exactly is he studying?

A.   He's studying changing understanding of

addiction from the 19th century through the present, especially nicotine addiction.  And he's looking at how the understanding changes over time and how cigarettes became addictive, how nicotine became addictive.

Q.   Did you suggest this research project to your student?

A.   Probably.  I mean, we tend to work these things out together.  The students have their own ideas and I gave ideas, so it's a mutual collegial type of relationship.

Q.   Do you know who suggested this particular topic first?

A.   No.

Q.   What is the student's name?

A.   His name is Stephan Risi.

Q.   Is Stephan being compensated for his research?

A.   Well, all Stanford students are paid to go to graduate school.

A.
	Yes, with some exceptions.

Q.
	So you apply and you're accepted into the

A.
	Every student gets full ride unless it's just

a master

Q.
	And so his compensation is that he has a full

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	What is the end goal of this research?

A.
	Scholarship, the truth.  Hopefully for him, a

he can get.  We hopefully train people to become
	
professors, but people can have whatever kind of job
	
they wan-

Q.
	Is this research going to be used by you in

this litigation?
	
A.
	Probably not this litigation.  But all of the

work I do with all of my students and my colleagues goes into my knowledge. And I don't really have a part of my brain that I separate out for the litigation part.

So what I've learned from him, and as from all of my colleagues, all goes into what I know.  And I testify about what I know.

Q.   Do you have any specific charge to Stephan about any topic that you believe you will offer direct or specific opinion on in tobacco litigation?

A.   I don't think so.

Q. I want to explore another -- a new topic. I want to explore a couple comments you've made at trial regarding Reader's Digest.

A.   Yes.

Q.   In previous trials, you have testified, "By the 1950s, Reader's Digest was more pro filter than anticigarette"?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What is the basis for that statement?

A.   Well, by the late 1950s -- or I should say in the late 1950s, there are three or four articles that are encouraging filters as safer, and that's actually one of the things that got filters going so powerfully was their endorsement by Reader's Digest.  So that's part of the basis for that view, those articles by Lois

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Mattox and others.

The second element is that even the head of Reader's Digest by that point was a smoker.  So in a sense, the cigarette and the cigarette ideology had at least partly penetrated Reader's Digest by that time.

Q.   Who was the head of Reader's Digest that you claim was a smoker?

A.   I forget the name of the person.

Q.   Where did you find out this information? What was your source?

A.   In the trips that your side just made to Lorillard in 1957 -- Reader's Digest starts going to Lorillard -- I think it's in Greenville -- and starts, you know, examining their technology, looking at how the Kent cigarette is made, things like that.

And that's where I ran across the discussion by Lorillard that the head of Reader's Digest was a smoker.  It's discussed in that late 1950s period, correspondence between Reader's Digest and Lorillard executives.

Q.   In the three to four articles, does Reader's Digest specifically say that filters are safer?

A.   Yes.  Something like that.

Q.   And so they use that language?

A.   Close to that, if not exactly that.  There's

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=259
Page 260

definitely the implication that they are better for you, some kind of language like that.  It's fairly -- it's unambiguous:  This is better or less harmful, whatever.

Q.   What period of time was this?

A.   I think it's '57, '58, '59.

Q.   You also -- let me ask you this:

At this point in time, in '57, '58, '59, the public health community was also suggesting:  Don't smoke.  But if you need to smoke, filter cigarettes may be better for you?

A.   Somewhere.  It's not a single message, but some people -- influential people were embracing that. Not all.  I mean, you can find a lot of comments where people say that filters are no safer.  So you can find both of those.

Q.   You also testified that Reader's Digest, quote, "endorsed and embraced filter cigarettes" --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- "as safer"?

A.   Right.

Q.   What is your basis for that statement?  The same article?

A.   Those articles, yeah.  They -- that's one of the main cultural forces that pushed people to switch to filters.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=260
Page 261

Q.   What is the basis for that opinion that it was one of the main cultural forces?

A.   That's explicit in the archives.  I must have mentioned this in Golden Holocaust, but there's several documents where they -- the cigarette industry privately almost thanks Reader's Digest or credits Reader's Digest for helping the shift over to filter cigarettes.  This is late '50s, early '60s internal documents.

Q.   Are you able to locate that particular passage for me?

A.   I don't know if I can or not.  It might be under Reader's Digest.  Yes, in the index under Reader's Digest, there are a number of entries.  One of the entries is "Ill-informed endorsement of filters." That's Pages 347 to 348, and also Page 438.

So if you look those up, you will -- I think you will find it.

Q.   I don't see it on Page 438.  That's okay.

Would you agree with me that the particular articles by Lois Mattox also contain negative comments about the tobacco companies?

A.   Of course.

Q.   And they contain negative comments about filters too?

A.   Well, I'm sure they would say, because they

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

thought
	. that filters still can kill
	you, sc
	> for sure.

Q.
	They did?
	
	

A.
	Yeah.
	
	

Q.
	And they contain negative
	comments about the
	
health
	risks of smoking as well; correct?
		

A.
	Well, not just the risk,
	but the
	harm.

Q.
	And the harm?
	
	

A.
	Yes.
	
	

Q.
	And within these articles
	, there'
	s no such

language that Reader's Digest says
		that they endorse a
	
filter
	cigarette; correct?
	
	

A.
	Well, I don't think they
	use the
	word

"endorse," but they certainly suppo
		rt them.
	They

reassured large numbers of people,
		right?
	I mean,

again,
	the tobacco industry credits
	them fc

people
	shift over to filters as less deadly, as safer.
		
Q.
	As --
	
	

A.
	As less deadly or safer.

A.   Looks like you can read my mind before I say it.

Q.   Is this one of the articles you were talking about?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And if you look on Page 36, if we could.

A.   Yes.

Q.   The middle of the page on the left-hand column, "Medical authorities say that these tar reductions (ranging from 7 to 17 percent) are too small to be really significant in terms of 'health protection.'"  Right?

A.   Right.

Q.   Is that what it says?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And they still talk about filtration on Page 37 on the left column.  "Now we begin to see what's wrong with filtration.  The old Chesterfield, Lucky Strike and Camel, for example, are all comparative low (approximately 31 milligrams) in tar.  Placing a filter-tip on any of these cigarettes could reduce the tar still more.  But no!  Instead, the tobacco companies offer you a deceptively longer cigarette with less tobacco but more tar, and -- in the case of L & M King or Hit Parade -- a whopping 29 or 33 percent more

nicotine.  How can that be?" Do you see that?

A.   Yes.  They're still -- they basically believe these tar and nicotine delivery figures, which themselves were bogus.  They don't even know about that source.  It's more like they're saying certain brands are actually not as low tar as they claim to be.  So even they are pretty confused.

Q.   Sure.  But --

A.   They still believed that, you know, filter-tips could reduce tar.  So they're still trapped in the filter ideology.

Q.   Right.  But at this point, the Reader's Digest is telling readers what's wrong with filtration, right, what you've just described to me?

A.   But they don't understand what's wrong with filtration.

Q.   But it's an issue that they brought up to people.  And they go on to say, "Other cigarette makers, however, profited from the Kent cigarette experience. They went all-out to give the smoker 'satisfaction' at any cost.  Not only did they adopt filters which, in most cases, are little more than mouthpieces; they also began loading the blends with heavier tobacco."

A.   Right.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=264
Page 265

Q.   They're telling the public that filters are little more than mouthpieces; right?

A.   Yeah.  But they also say on Page 39, "It is entirely possible to manufacture filter tips much more efficient than any now on the market."

So they're very optimistic about the future of filters.  They're trapped within the filter fraud.  I think that one has even been underlined in my copy.

Q.   On Page 37 they said, "Whatever the reason for this peculiar omission, one thing is clear: the tobacco in most popular filter-tip brands today is not high-grade."

And you were talking about the filters.  And the last question is, "Why aren't these improved filters available?  What reasons do cigarette companies give for not adopting them?"

Do you see that?

A.   At the very last --

Q.   The very last --

A.   Yes.  So in other words, they're very optimistic about the future of filtration.

Q.   And you use the word "optimistic."  But it doesn't in this article rise to the level of endorsing filters, does it?

A.   Oh, there's no doubt about that.  They

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 266

endorse filters.  I mean, you've got that paragraph on Page 39, "The improved filters."  It's looking at the bright future ahead of filtration.  "The improved filters would be made from essentially the same materials now being used; that is, cellulose acetate plus, possibly, some form of powdery filler.  They would cost no more to produce.  They would be as 'easy on the draw' as the present filter tips.  Yet, unlike present filters (which filters as little as 10 percent), the improved tips would filter 40 percent or more of the tar from the mainstream smoke."

So they are just as benighted and defrauded as Wynder was.  There was this glorious future of 40 percent filtration.  They're caught up in it, right?

Q.   And it's your opinion that because they are caught up in it, they've endorsed and embraced the notion?

A.   For sure.

Q.   Okay.

A.   It is really encouraging the industry to make more filter cigarettes, more highly filtered.

Q.   As were other members of the public health community at that point in time; correct?

A.   Some were, yeah, like Wynder, for example, who is quoted right in the next paragraph.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=266
Page 267

Q.   And this particular article actually questions the efficacy of the filters that were being used at this point in time; right?

A.   Well, the efficiency.

Q.   Yes.

A.   It's basically calling for higher efficiency cigarettes, high efficiency filtration.

So again, they're totally on the filter bandwagon.  They're just saying to the industry:  Come on, guys.  Your filters are not very efficient.  Make them better.  That's the sense in which they're endorsing and embracing filters.

Q.   What is your trial schedule like in the next three months?

A.   I have got a trial next week in Alaska.  And then after that, I'm doing the Kaplan case in South Florida.  And then it becomes more sketchy after that.

Q.   When is the Kaplan case?

A.   I think that's the week after.

Q.   Okay.  So Florida next week, and then two weeks from now Kaplan?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And after that, nothing solid?

A.   Nothing solid.  You never know.  Trials can get settled or whatever.

MS. CHUANG:  Okay.  I think that's all the questions I have.

MR. QUINLAN:  Mr. Roslansky, I have a few followups, if you want me to go first.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Yes, that's fine. FURTHER EXAMINATION BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   So, Dr. Proctor, going back to that Reader's Digest article you were just looking at, if someone were to pick that Reader's Digest up, do you think they would have switched to a filtered brand that was on the market at the time?

A.   For sure.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form.

THE WITNESS:  If I were a smoker and I read this, I would say, "Whoa, I'd better start smoking a filter cigarette."  Now, if I was not a smoker, probably not. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   Despite the fact that the article was referring to all the problems there were with the present filters, you still think that the message from that is not:  Wait for a better filter to come out than switch to a filter now?

A.   Oh, yeah, for sure.  I would, I mean, if I

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

had to rely on this.  That's what the industry itself said.  They credited Reader's Digest.  There's a great document on that that says we can really thank Reader's Digest for helping push filter cigarettes.

Q.   And is that because of the cultural prominence of Reader's Digest at the time? MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  Yeah. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   So I want to go back to the beginning where Ms. Chuang was asking about the Juul cigarette, the E-cigarette.

A.   Yes.

Q.   You said that some individuals came to your office asking for your endorsement?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what did you tell them in response?

A.   I mainly just listened.  I was kind of amazed that a VC would -- or a manufacturer would come to my office.  So I just mainly listened.  I didn't really say anything.

Q.   Did they ever follow up with you?

A.   If they did, I didn't respond.

Q.   Did they specifically ask you in this meeting if you would put your name or endorsement on the

product?  Or what did they actually ask you?

A.   I think it was more like:  What would you think of this?  Isn't this a revolutionary -- this was very early in the E-cigarette craze, and so it had a little bit of a different feel than if it were to occur now.  And they were very excited, and they thought maybe I would be excited.  And I was definitely curious.

Q.   Not excited, though?

A.   I was curious.  I was excited in kind of a neutral way.

Q.   You said they were going to other members of the tobacco control community?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you know if they asked Dr. Prochaska for her endorsement?

A.   I don't know.  She was very young at that point.

Q.   How about Dr. Jackler?

the SRITA

Q.

	So in the history of the SRITA Web site, it's

your understanding that it had 5 million visitors or
	
hits?
	

A.
	I think that's right.  Some of those are

repeats.
	

Q.
	Do you know how many unique visitors it had?

much smaller than that.

Q.   And consumer products is one of the products that is part of the design school?

A.   I presume, yeah, sure.

Q.   You said that a lot of your students tried Juul?

A.   Yes.

Q.   How do you know that?

A.   They tell me.  In class last year, I think I was the only person who didn't -- who hadn't heard of Juuls.  Every single one of my students had heard of

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

them.  In fact, I was talking to a student two days ago who said he didn't know any student who hadn't used Juul.

Q.   And what do you tell your students that use Juul?

A.   Well, I tell them what I tell everyone.  I mean, depends on what the topic is.

Q.   I mean, do you tell your students that use Juul that they shouldn't use it?

A.   Not really.  No, that's not really my job.

Q.   Do any of your students, to your knowledge, use other E-cigarettes like Vuse manufactured by Reynolds?

A.   I've never heard of them using it, but I haven't asked them.  So I'll have to ask them.  Vuse has not come up, but Juuls has come up.  So Vuse is definitely not as hot at Stanford as Juuls.

Q.   Do any of your students currently smoke cigarettes?

A.   Some do, yes.

Q.   If you have a student that smokes cigarettes, do you encourage them to stop smoking?

A.   No, not really.  That's not how we work. It's -- you know, it would almost be like contraire-in-chief or something if you're a Stanford

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

student who smokes.  So for me to say -- I mean, they obviously know what I think about cigarettes, so it would be kind of redundant for me to lecture them on that.  It's not my job.

Q.   But for your students who smoke E-cigarettes, are they aware of your views on E-cigarettes?

A.   Well, if they've taken my class.  If we're talking about, you know, Babylonian astronomy or Mayan calendrics or Newtonian optics, it doesn't come up.  But if the topic is cigarettes, of course, they knew my views.

Q.   What are your views on E-cigarettes?

A.   My views on E-cigarettes are that they are less deadly but that they may cause more harm by virtue of existing rather than not existing.  Some things can be both safer and cause more harm.  That's not a contradiction.

Q.   And how do you think that they may cause more harm?

A.   Insofar as they promote use of regular cigarettes, insofar as they are a gateway for training, insofar as they encourage addiction, or insofar as they offer bridge release or bridge relief for regular smokers, it's possible that they could prolong the regular cigarette epidemic.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

So they could be more harmful, in my view, by virtue of promoting and encouraging regular cigarette use.

Q.   Have you ever talked to any of your students about any of those potential outcomes from the use of Juul or other E-cigarettes?

A.   Well, sure.  Yeah, it's basic.

Q.   Have any of your students ever transitioned, to your knowledge, from an E-cigarette to a combustible cigarette?

A. I don't know one way or the other. I really wouldn't know that. It's not something I would track, the smoking behavior over time with my students.

Q.   In any of your discussions you've ever had with any of your students, have any of them ever said to you:  I've started with E-cigarettes but now I'm smoking combustible cigarettes?

A.   No.  But I would expect that to happen in high school rather than college anyway.  And also not so much maybe in the Bay Area as maybe elsewhere in the country.

Q.   And why not the Bay Area?

A. The Bay Area has a relatively low smokership. It's much lower than nationwide, especially at an elite place like Stanford.  You know, the wealthy don't smoke

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

as much as poorer people that have gone to other campuses like state schools.  Like San Jose State, I know there's a lot more people smoking.

Q.   Smoking cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   But when you have these discussions with your students about whether they're using E-cigarettes or Juul, you don't tell them they shouldn't use them because they could be promoting an ongoing epidemic?

A.   You know, that's just not the language of a scholar, at least that's not how I interact with my students.  It's more intellectual than that.  That sounds like maybe something more you would tell like an eight-year-old, the way you put it.

Q.   So you don't feel you need to tell your students that?

A.   Yeah, that's right.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  Object to form. THE WITNESS:  It's better put.  These are research environments where we are doing research, and the kind of policy implication is often implicit.  But also people come to these topics with their own strongly-held views. BY MR. QUINLAN:

Q.   Now, when you were talking about the company

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Web sites with Ms. Chuang, you posed a question, "Why would people go to these Web sites?"

A.   For sure.

Q.   And what do you mean by that?

A.   Well, why would you?  I mean, people don't trust the cigarette industry.  We know that from --every time I've testified, I'm shown the surveys that show that Philip Morris and Reynolds, only 3 percent of everyone think they are the most reliable source of information.  So right off the bat, why would people go to a cigarette maker to look up information on public health?  It's implausible.

They're not -- again, I can't imagine why someone would go to a Philip Morris or Reynolds Web site --

Q.   And --

A.   -- unless to make fun of it or something.

Q.   And those surveys that you were talking about that you've been shown, those date as far back as the '60s and '70s; right?

A.   Which surveys?  Yes, the ones which look at the low confidence in the cigarette industry?  The earliest ones I think are in the late '50s.

Q.   And so from the late '50s up through today, in your opinion, consumers don't often turn to companies

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

like Reynolds or Philip Morris USA for information about smoking?

A.   Right.  And oddly enough, you guys use that as proof that, you know, people were not believing this industry fraud.  I view it as a fact that, you know, information is not why people smoke.  They smoke from impressions more than encyclopedic knowledge.  You know what I mean?  That's why we -- you and I sort of agree on the surveys but have radically different interpretations of them.

Of course, I testify, as you know, that that's why the industry adopted the third-party approach, because they knew they could fool more people by harnessing the scientists and then disguising the fact that they were puppeteering the process than by directly saying themselves that, you know, cigarettes don't cause cancer.

Q.   Now, are you involved with the Web site called tobaccoanalytics.com?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What's your involvement with that Web site?

A.   Well, that's my student who is running that. I mean, so I'm involved insofar as I'm the advisor of that site.

Q.   Is that the same student you talked with

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

Page 279

Ms. Chuang about?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I went on tobaccoanalytics.com and went poking around a little.

Who decides what preloaded search terms come up when you open the Web site?

A.   I didn't really know there were preloaded search terms.  Is it addiction?  Is that the one?

Q.   Yes.  So if you go on the Web site and you open it up, the search we did was preloaded with something like "addiction" or "inbifo."

A.   Okay.  I hadn't really noticed that, but now it rings a bell.  I think it's just because that's --you have to have some filler word there.  And so that's his project, is the history of addiction.  Sort of like if you go to the n-grams, which is a similar version of n-grams, it starts up with, I think, Einstein and Frankenstein because apparently those are widely searched.

So Stephan just put that in as a filler because that's his beloved project.

Q.   And what is the connection between tobaccoanalytics.com and the Legacy Web site?

A.   The only connection is that in order to get that data, he had to harvest all of the data from

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=279
Page 280

Legacy.  Then there are some technical details in the difference between the data as they're harvested, some ordinary words or some -- I should say some rare words are not included in Tobacco Analytics, and conversely, there's not a paternalistic forcing in Tobacco Analytics in the way that there is for Legacy.

So let me give you an example.  If you search on Legacy, it will give you the plural and the singular, because there is kind of a paternalistic assumption: Oh, you must be interested in both the plural and the singular.  Well, we don't do that with Tobacco Analytics.  So it gives you a pure linguistic ability to search the documents.  It allows to you do searches of misspellings, for example, or things that are just more of linguistic interest.

Q.   Have you used the Tobacco Analytics in your research?

A.   I'm beginning to, yeah.  I mean, I'm sort of helping advise the building of it.

Q.   And when I went on the Web site, do you understand what the phrase "de-dupe" means?

A.   I don't.

Q.   So if you go on a Legacy Web site and you do a search term, you can get the same document over and over and over and over again.

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=280
Page 281

A.   Right.

Q.   You get a duplication?

A.   Right.

Q.   So what effort is made on the tobaccoanalytics.com to de-dupe and make sure that it's not collecting the same document multiple times and counting that as different documents?

A.   Well, I'm assuming he has a button for that. I mean, there's, I guess, two different types of questions you might be asking.  One is just in a search, how do you avoid getting the same thing over and over and over again versus in terms of a numerical ranking. I don't know how he's handled that.  There must be a button.  He's got a lot of ability to push a button and make things go away.

So there probably is the same on Legacy, a button that you push to eliminate duplicates.

Q.   Sounds like you have a very sophisticated understanding of how the Web site works.

A.   I hope you're not being sarcastic.  But it's true that he's sort of the brains behind it, and I'm more the brawn.

Q.   And you said that as part of his research, he's trying to figure out, quote, "How nicotine became addictive"?

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=281
Page 282

A.   Yes.

Q.   What did you mean by that?

A.   I meant that -- Stephan has an interesting way of putting it, which is that cigarettes are, in a sense, an off-the-shelf use for an insecticide.  It's a clever way he puts it.  Meaning that for the millions of years that Nicotiana has existed, it's mostly been a pesticide, a natural pesticide.  And, in fact, it is, you know, still in the 1930s and '40s and afterwards used as an insecticide.  It only becomes possible for it to be addictive once it is produced in a form that is inhalable and palatable and nonpoisonous.

In other words, you can't just go into a field and eat tobacco and become addicted to it.  That's why only humans are addicted to tobacco.  In other words, why doesn't a cow become addicted to tobacco or something else?  Well, it's because there's not a mechanism for them to use it in a way that is delivered in a mild regular form that's -- that we call the cigarette.

So there's a whole series of technical developments that occur mainly in the 19th century that make it possible for the cigarette to become an object of mass consumption, and therefore, a mass addiction. The other form of using tobacco that had existed

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=282
Page 283

earlier, namely chewing tobacco and pipes and cigars, were much less addictive because there was much less a liability for use.  So that's sort of what I've been saying.

Is that too obscure?

Q.   No, but I just want to clarify a few things. Chewing tobacco is addictive; right?

A.   Yeah, of course.  It is less addictive, but it is addictive.  In other words, all addictive technologies are more or less addictive.  So anything containing nicotine in theory could be addictive except maybe eggplants or tomatoes because it's in too low a concentration.

But chewing tobacco can be addictive.  It's less addictive simply because of the technology by which it's delivered.  So yes, as long as we realize there's a -- there are degrees of addictive potency and different delivery technologies.

The cigarette is a more efficient vehicle for the delivery of nicotine, and therefore, it's more addictive.

Q.   And cigarettes were addictive before R. J. Reynolds ever came up with the Camel cigarette?

A.   Yes, that's true because they were being inhaled and they had a lot of nicotine.  So that's

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430
pgNbr=283
Page 284

really all you need, that in combination with availability.  So as long as it's available, you know.

In other words, anything that promotes liability to use, if it's pharmacal -- if it's already pharmacologically addictive, those social technological factors that make it easier to use are what really make it addictive.

Is that clear?

MR. QUINLAN:  Yes.  Those are the all the questions I have.

THE WITNESS:  Okay.

MR. ROSLANSKY:  I may disappoint you, but I don't have any questions.

THE WITNESS:  Oh, come on.  I was counting on you.  Maybe if you had gone into Stanford and taken my class, you would have had a few questions for me.
