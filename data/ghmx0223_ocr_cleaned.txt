BY MR. LATHAM:

Q.  Good morning, Dr. Borgerding.  For the record my name is Will Latham and I represent R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and I have some follow-up questions for you to ask you about some things that Mr. Paige asked you about earlier in the deposition. Before we get to my questions because we're now into a second day, will you please reintroduce yourself to the jury?

A.  My name is Michael Borgerding.  I work at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

Q.  And what is your position at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Comoanv^

A.  I'm a Senior Director in the Research and Development Department.

Q.  In what division or group do you work in in the Research and Development Department?

A.  Within Research and Development I work in a group called Product Integrity.

Q.  And what are your responsibilities as a Senior Director in Product Integrity?

A.  My responsibilities are to lead our clinical studies team and to interact with my colleagues throughout the department in terms of department activities.

Q.  During earlier in the deposition there was a number of different times where you talked with Mr. Paige about the concept of harm reduction.  Will you please explain what is harm reduction as it relates to cigarettes and tobacco use?

A.  Harm reduction is the concept of reducing the harm associated with tobacco use.  So there's no such thing as a safe tobacco product.  There is risk from use of all tobacco products. And one of the fundamental concepts of transforming tobacco is to migrate smokers that continue to want to use tobacco products from combustible products such as cigarettes to products that have the potential to present substantially less risk.

Of course, for those that would like to quit, the concept of transforming tobacco would be for those individuals to quit using tobacco products.

Q.  How does your work leading the clinical studies group relate to harm reduction?

A.  Clinical studies are one type of study that helps place tobacco products on the tobacco product risk continuum.  So clinical studies are studies of how smokers, for example, would interact with cigarettes or potentially other tobacco products.

And within a clinical study there are measurements of exposure to toxicants or biomarkers of potential harm.  So these types of measurements inform us and help us to place tobacco products on the tobacco product risk continuum.

Q.  Have you personally worked on tobacco harm reduction during your career at Reynolds?

A.  Yes.  The bulk of my career, the vast majority of the years that I've been at Reynolds have been focused on developing products and evaluating products that have the potential to reduce exposure to toxicants and to reduce the risks

13  associated with cigarettes and tobacco use.

Q.  For how long have you been employed at R.J. Reynolds?

A.  I've been employed at R.J. Reynolds since 1980, so coming up on 34 years.

Q.  And will you give the jury a brief

19 |  description of your educational background starting

with college?

A.  Yes.  I have an undergraduate degree, a B.S. in biochemistry, a master's degree in chemistry and a Ph.D. in chemistry.

24        Q.  And will you give the jury a general

chronology of the types of work that you've done

during your 34 years at Reynolds?

A.  During my career at R.J. Reynolds I started

3   as a junior research chemist. My responsibilities

were to develop analytical test methods to evaluate tobacco and tobacco smoke.  And these were using separation techniques, something called gas chromatography and liquid chromatography along with other instrumental techniques.

So at the beginning of my career I developed and validated analytical test methods.  As my career progressed I began to develop programs to

12   evaluate products that had the potential to reduce

13   exposure and reduce risk.

14            I led large efforts in that regard.  In

15   those years I began to interact with various

16   government bodies such as the Federal Trade

17 |    Commission and from there various state governments,

18 i    other governments in terms of other countries.  And

19   so part of my work began to be focused on regulation

20   and testing that's part of regulation.  And from

21   there more recently I've worked in the clinical

22   studies area.

23                     Q.     Today is Reynolds �  is R.J.  Reynolds

24        Tobacco Company regulated by the FDA?

25                     A.     Yes.     Today Reynolds is regulated by the

Page 332

1    FDA.

2          Q.  And when did FDA regulation begin?

3          A.  We became regulated by the FDA as of 2009.

4           Q.  During your career have you written

5    articles that have been published in peer reviewed

6    scientific journals?

7          A.  Yes.  I have.

8          Q.  Can you give the jury an approximate number

9    of articles you've written that have been published

10    in the peer reviewed scientific literature?

11          A.  I believe the current number would be 47

12    articles at this point in time.

13          Q.  And without going into any detail about the

14    specifics of the articles, could you give the jury

15    the topics about which you have written and

16 17

18 19

21 22

23 24 25

published on?

A.  Yes.  Those publications would include, for example, data around the development and validation of analytical test methods to look at constituents in tobacco or tobacco smoke.  Some of the work specifically would focus on measurements of very small amounts of materials but materials that are toxicants, things like carcinogens, cancer causing compounds and other compounds that have been reported to be associated with the risks of smoking.

Q.  (By Mr. Latham)  For 2013, Dr. Borgerding, approximately how many cigarettes did Reynolds manufacture and sell?

A.  In � in 2013 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company would have manufactured and sold about 65 billion cigarettes.

Q. What is Defendant's Exhibit 2?

A.  Defendant's Exhibit 2 is a chart that shows the number of cigarettes in units of billions of cigarettes that were sold between the years 1997 and 2013 by what is currently R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

Q.  And how does the number of cigarettes sold in 2013 compare to the number of cigarettes sold

18  earlier in time?

A.  it's much smaller.  It would be a small fraction of, for example, the number of cigarettes that were sold in 1997.

22 I       Q.  Can you estimate over the past 20 years how

much Reynolds' cigarette volume has declined during that time?

A. Yes.  It does.

Q. And you discussed earlier the concept of transforming tobacco and migration. Does this page give the company's position on that concept?

A.  Yes.  It does.

Q.  Will you read that, please, for the jury?

A.  Yes.  Under the section for tobacco consumers related to harm reduction, it says significant reductions in the harm associated with the use of cigarettes can be achieved by providing accurate information regarding the comparative risks of tobacco products to adult tobacco consumers, thereby encouraging smokers to migrate to the use of smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products and by developing new smoke**free tobacco and nicotine products and other actions.

Q.  If you'd turn to the next page, please? Let me go back for a second.  Before I do that, Dr. Borgerding, I didn't print out a screenshot for it, but does your website contain the company's position on whether or not nicotine in tobacco products is addictive?

position is on whether nicotine is addictive?

A.  The Guiding Principles and Beliefs would state that nicotine in tobacco products is addictive but is not considered a significant threat to health.

Q.  Thank you.  If you go back to the next page of the Exhibit 3, does your website provide information about where consumers can get information about smoking and health from the public health community?

A.  Yes.  It does.

Q.  Is that what the next page of the screenshot that I handed you is?

A.  Yes.  This screenshot from the website is in the area of making decisions regarding tobacco use.  And it says R.J.

Q.  What does this page depict?

A.  This is also a guiding principle and belief in the area of tobacco consumers.  It states the best course of action for tobacco consumers concerned about their health is to quit.

Adults who continue to use tobacco products should consider the reductions of risks for serious diseases associated with moving from cigarettes to the use of smoke-free tobacco or nicotine products.

A.  Niconovum is a � it's referred to as a sister company for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, that is, both R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Niconovum have the same parent company, which is Reynolds American.

to smokers.  It's trying to make the products available in places that smokers would purchase cigarettes in quantities and at a price point to where it would be something that would be comparable and attractive and that basically there would be no barriers to consider using the nicotine replacement therapy product to stop smoking.

So it's accessible to smokers.  It's displayed and sold where tobacco is sold.  It compared to other companies that sell NRT is in smaller packages at a lower price point to make it more comparable and a more viable choice for smokers. And the intention is, again, for smokers that would like to quit to be able to have the product available and to be able to stop smoking.

Q.  And does Exhibit 4 summarize what you just told the jury?

A.  It does.  It summarizes that same information as well as makes a statement that Zonnic is marketed to empower smokers to succeed in quitting.  One less cigarette, one more victory.

Q.  Thank you; Dr. Borgerding. We're done with that. Dr. Borgerding, earlier in the deposition you explained for Mr. Paige what the concept of transforming tobacco was.  Will you remind the jury

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424                                    www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

briefly what Reynolds' business strategy of transforming tobacco is?

A.  Transforming tobacco has a number of elements.  It would include � excuse me.  It would include the concepts of harm reduction and migration as I've indicated in earlier answers, so specifically the concept of migrating smokers that are concerned about the risks of smoking to either other forms of tobacco that would have less risk associated with the use or to not smoking at all, to guitting.

In addition to harm reduction, it would include accelerating the decline in youth smoking. It would include being innovative in our approaches to transforming tobacco as some of the core elements.

MR. LATHAM:  I want to focus at this point on Reynolds' reduced harm product part of the transforming tobacco business strategy, and I'm going to mark as an exhibit this demonstrative as Defendant's Number 5.  And Gary, for you it's the Reynolds' Reduced Harm Products demonstrative, Oem 216 on the right-hand side.

2           0-  (By Mr. Latham)  Dr. Borgerding, how does

3    Defense Exhibit 5 relate to what you just told the

4    jury about transforming tobacco?

5          A.  The way in which this picture and slide

6    would relate is that it captures the concepts that

7    I've indicated in my earlier answer but in terms of

8

9 10 11

various result of innovation that has come out of Reynolds and our research and development colleagues and others that would align with the concepts of

12    transforming tobacco and could be placed on the

13    tobacco product risk continuum.

14               So on this demonstrative are products, for

15    example, that in relative terms would be of higher

16    risk.  These would be combustible cigarettes, and

17    then it would include innovative products like

18    cigarettes that heat but do not burn tobacco,

19    products that are noncombustible such as Camel Snus,

20    a smoke-free product.

21               It would include things like dissolvable

22 I  tobacco products, which are also not combusted.  It

23    would include something called electronic cigarettes

24    and, specifically, the brand Vuse, and then would

Q.  Does this demonstrative show different products that scientists from R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company have worked on over many years?

A. Yes.  It does.

Q.  For how long has Reynolds been working trying to reduce the harm caused by cigarettes?

A.  Reynolds1 scientists have been working to try and understand what is associated that is what drives risk and to develop products that reduce exposure and risk for the entire time that the research department has existed and definitely throughout all of my career and before then. MR. LATHAM:  I'm going to mark as Defendant's Exhibit Number 6 a demonstrative.  Gary, for your reference it's Oem 81, Major Efforts to Make Less Hazardous Cigarettes.

MR. PAIGE:  Okay, yeah.  I got it. (Defendant's Exhibit Number 6 was marked for identification.)

Q.      (By Mr. Latham)  Dr. Borgerding, I've handed you what's been marked as Defendant's Exhibit 6, which is a demonstrative.  Hill you explain for the jury what this demonstrative is?

efforts to make less hazardous cigarettes. So it's focused on combustible cigarettes and it summarizes some of the key initiatives and the key successes in reducing yields of cigarettes, for example, through something called general reduction, selective reduction, tobacco heating, reduced tar-to-nicotine ratio and the use of tobacco substitutes.

Q.  Without going into a tremendous amount of detail on each of these different initiatives, will you explain for the jury what they are and how they would relate to potentially reducing the risks of combustible cigarettes?

A.  Yes.  When a cigarette is smoked, tobacco is combusted and it forms cigarette smoke.  The chemical composition of cigarette smoke is quite complex.  There are many thousands of compounds. Approximately 7,000 have been identified over more than 50 years of research by many scientists.

Of those many thousands of compounds, most are present in very, very small quantities, millionths or billionths or even less than billionths of a gram.  So it's a very challenging analytical problem.  And the key question, of course, is which of those compounds are associated with the risks of tobacco use, which of those

compounds are associated with the risks of harm or harm to the health.  And so there have been various strategies employed to try and address the general question.

The concept of general reduction with cigarettes was without knowing which compounds, to try and reduce the yields of all compounds.  So to reduce exposure to everything, which doesn't require someone to know which are the most important compounds.

In terms of selective reduction, it would be somewhat the converse of that concept in that it would be focused on very specific compounds and compounds that are associated with the risks of smoking.

MR. PAIGE:  Well, the only thing is, you know, when we were going to recontinue this, we did do the renotice in Wilcox.  We did not do one in Schleider.  I don't want to have any problems with this.  I mean, Reynolds is the main defendant in each case.  I just want to before we proceed now that I'm thinking about it, I just want to be clear Reynolds is not going to object to us using it in Schleider.

MR. LATHAM:  Correct.  We wouldn't.

Borgerding, before we were interrupted by the telephone call you were describing Reynolds' historical efforts to make less hazardous cigarettes and you had talked about general reduction and you talked about selective reduction.  I think you were in the middle of that, so could you continue where you were in explaining the historical efforts by Reynolds to make less hazardous cigarettes?

A.  Yes.  If I may, I'll wait a moment for the train to pass.  Yes.  So I was discussing major efforts to make less hazardous cigarettes and a number of approaches to that when I began to answer the question.  I spoke about general reduction, which is a focus on reducing everything that's in smoke; selective reduction, which is a focus on trying to reduce specific constituents within smoke that are associated with the risks of smoking.

Another approach, another major effort was the concept of tobacco heating.  Many of the compounds that are present in smoke and especially some of those that are associated with the risks of smoking come from tobacco being combusted, that is, burning tobacco.  And tobacco heating is mindful of that as an approach and rather than burning tobacco, it tries to produce a smoke aerosol by only heating

tobacco.  So it's a much simpler smoke.  The fourth approach is something called reduced tar-to-nicotine ratio.  And this is a concept that was put forth and studied by many.

It's the concept of providing cigarette smoke that would have a medium level of nicotine and a low amount of tar.  And so it's something,   again, that much like general reduction would reduce exposure, reduce yield of all the things that are in smoke.

And the last major effort is in the area of tobacco substitutes.  So it's the concept, again, of rather than burning tobacco to having some part of the blend be something that wasn't tobacco to try

15  and produce a simpler smoke and one that would have

less harmful compounds in it.

Q.  To your knowledge, Dr. Borgerding, were Reynolds' historical efforts to reduce the potential harm caused by cigarettes supported by the highest levels of the company?

A.  Yes.  They were.

MR. LATHAM:  Gary, I'm going to use Dem 27, which the title is memo to Senkus from Galloway (1968).

A.  Yes.  I am.

Q.  For the record, this is Defendant's Exhibit AS-00173.  What is demonstrative Number 7?

A.  This demonstrative is showing the document that you just referred to, which is a memo to Dr. Senkus from Mr. Galloway.  It was something that was sent in 1968 and it is � it is providing guidance from the head of the company, from the president of the company to tha scientist, that is, Dr. Senkus, that lad tha **- lad tha research afforts at that time.

Q. Was Dr. Senkus tha head of tha Research Department in 1968?

Tobacco Company.

Q. Will you read what the president of the company wrote to the head of R&D in 1968?

A.  He indicated that in cooperation with

5    others you should push the work concerning tobacco

6    and health.  You should prepare a plan to foster any

7    relationship with government personnel in the quest

8    for mutual understanding of facts, ultimately to

9    gain the cooperation and proper research of the

10    subject.

12    there is a, quote, safer cigarette, let's continue

13    and increase our efforts in this program.  Please

14    prepare a plan to carry it out.

15          Q,    What was happening with the National Cancer

16    Institute in this time frame, 1968, related to less

17    hazardous cigarettes?

18          A.  In the 1968 time frame within the NIH there

19    was an effort put forward to try and evaluate the

20    concepts of safer cigarettes, technologies that

21    could be used to reduce the chemistry and the

Q. Was Dr. Senkus a representative of Reynolds on the tobacco working group?

/��  ue was f  yes �

Q.  And did Reynolds work with the National Cancer Institute as part of this less hazardous cigarette program?

A.  Yes, throughout that entire time period.

Q.  When you were talking earlier about general reduction as an effort to make less hazardous cigarettes, how historically did Reynolds measure progress at generally reducing the yields of tar and nicotine in its products?

A.  That measurement would have been done by looking at the yields of tar and nicotine in mainstream cigarette smoke.

Q.  And what is tar?

A.  Tar is a defined quantity.  It is in mainstream cigarette smoke and would be defined as the wet total particulate matter minus two quantities, that is, nicotine and water.  So in simple terms it's the particulate material that results from combustion of tobacco.

Q.  Does the particulate material that results from the combustion of tobacco contain toxicants and

reduction technologies applied to cigarettes that were actually sold in the commercial market?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Were general and selective reduction techniques applied to Reynolds cigarette brands such as Camel and Salem?

A.  Yes.

Q.  With respect to tar, what does -- what does the chart show?

A.  The chart shows that as these technologies were introduced into cigarette design, the yields of tar greatly declined, that is, in roughly 1954 the tar yield for � on a sales-weighted average basis for cigarettes that were sold was about between 35 and 40 milligrams of tar.

And that declined very substantially as the technologies were introduced, and as of 1998 the sales-weighted average would have been less than 15 milligrams per cigarette of tar yield.  And so there was a very large, significant reduction as these technologies were introduced into cigarette design.

Q. With respect to nicotine, what does the chart show?

A.  The chart would show a very similar result,

that is, again, as the technologies were introduced into cigarette design, the yields of nicotine were greatly reduced.  They would have declined, for example, from between two-and-a-half and three milligrams per cigarette in 1954 to below one milligram in 1998.

Q.  Okay.  Done with that one.  Earlier you were talking about the concept of tobacco heating cigarettes as one of Reynolds' efforts to make less hazardous cigarettes.  Are you familiar with a tobacco heating cigarette that Reynolds manufactures and sells called Eclipse?

A.  Yes.  I am.

Q.  What is Eclipse?

A.  Eclipse is a cigarette that's based upon the concept of primarily heating rather than burning tobacco.  So in order to form mainstream smoke aerosol, that is produced primarily by heating the tobacco and by volatilizing an aerosol-forming material, specifically glycerol, and that makes the smoke; but because very little tobacco is burned, the smoke is much simpler than for other cigarettes. There's a reduction or an absence of many of the thousands of compounds that would be found in other cigarettes.

And thasa reductions for Bclipsa comparad to tha combustible cigaratta would ba anywhere from about generally 50 percent to most of tha compounds being raducad by 80, 90 percent or mora.

Q.  Mr. Paige asked you about a cigarette smoke constituent called formaldehyde earlier in the deposition.  Do you recall that?

A.  I do, yes.

Q. Will you � how does formaldehyde yield of

13  Eclipsa compare to yield from a combustible

cigarette?

A.  The Eclipse formaldehyde yield is reduced by 58 percent, almost 60 percent comparad to the combustible cigarette.

Q.  Dr. Borgerding, you're in the clinical studies group currently?

A.  Yes.

Q.     Did Reynolds conduct studies in smokers on Eclipse?

A.  Yes.  I am.

Q.  What is Exhibit Number 10?

A.  Exhibit Number 10 is a chart summarizing reductions in biomarkers of cancer causing compounds, that is, carcinogens, for smokers who switched from their usual brand of combustible cigarette to Eclipse, and the duration of that switching was for 24 weeks.

And so in terms of the biomarkers that were measured, a number of the biomarkers were for compounds that had been reported to be carcinogens. And in terms of when someone switched, on average their reduction or their change in biomarker response would have been anywhere from a reduction of about 30 to 65 percent in the various biomarkers,

3         Q.  Is Eclipse � will you explain for the jury

4   the history of Eclipse being sold commercially?

5         A.  Yes.  Eclipse has been sold commercially in

6 | the United States for quite a number of years.  It

8   would have been introduced into test market and then

12         Q.  Okay.  As part of the study that's depicted

13 �  in Exhibit Number 10, did Reynolds also have groups

14   of smokers in that study who switched to low

15   yielding tobacco combustible cigarettes?

16         A.  Yes.  One part of that clinical study was

18   their usual brand to something that at that time

19   would have been considered a lower yielding

20   cigarette.

4                   Q.  (By Mr. Latham)  Dr. Borgerding, what is

Exhibit Number 11?

6        A.  Exhibit Number 11 is a chart summarizing

the same types of biomarkers that I discussed a moment ago � a moment ago.  So these are biomarkers of compounds that have been reported to be cancer causing compounds, carcinogens, when they're tested unto themself.

And the chart shows that when smokers that switch from smoking their usual brand of combustible cigarette switched for 24 weeks to smoking a combustible cigarette that was then called an ultra low tar cigarette, that there were statistically

17  significant reductions in exposure to these cancer

causing compounds.

And so specifically within this chart it calls out 2-aminonaphthalene, 4-aminobiphenyl, a nitrosamine and some other compounds, acrylamide and orthotoluidine, and shows that exposure was reduced by generally from about 24 percent to about 38 percent when switching from one combustible cigarette to another that was ultra lov7 tar in

Q. What � as a tobacco scientist and one who's worked on reducing the yields of cigarettes, tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the

5   years, what does this tell you about whether

reductions of tar and nicotine yields is a potential way to reduce the risk of smoking?

A.  It very clearly shows the introduction of general reduction technologies that I described earlier.  And certain specific reduction technologies do, in fact, result in people that would smoke these cigarettes being exposed to less than people that would smoke cigarettes that don't have those same technologies.

Q.     Earlier in your discussion about Reynolds' transformxng tobacco and migration business strategy you mentioned a product called Camel Snua.  Do you recall that?

A.  X do, yes.

Q.  What is Camel Snus?

A.  Camel Snus is a smokeless tobacco product, that is, it's not burned or smoked in any way.  It's used orally.  It's something that is like products that have been sold in Sweden for a long time.  So it's a pouched product of finely ground tobacco.

The tobaccos are selected to be very low in certain constituents, and it's something that the tobacco blend is heat treated rather than fermented.

So products that might typically be found in the U.S. over many years would have had tobaccos that were fermented.  It would be distinguished in that it's heat treated.  So it's very low in its levels of certain toxicants and it's something that's been used in Sweden for many years.

And there's epidemiology that shows that when smokers in Sweden over the years have switched from that type of product to Snus, there's been a very significant reduction in the risk for diseases such as lung cancer.

Q.     As part of the study we talked about, the clinical study of Eclipse and smokers who switched to a ULT, did Reynolds also look at smokers who switched to Camel Snus? A.  Yes.

MR. LATHAM:  I'm going to mark as the next Exhibit Number 12, a demonstrative exhibit.  Gary, for your reference this is Oem 141, Reductions in Carcinogen Biomarkers in Smokers who Switched to Snus.

(Dafandant's Exhibit Number 12 was markad for identification.)

Q.     (By Mr. Latham)  Dr. Borgerding, what is Dafandant's Exhibit Number 12?

A.  This is a chart that, again, summarizes for various biomarkers of carcinogens what the change in exposure was when a smoker switched from smoking cigarettes to using Camel Snua.

And in the particular study that was conducted, while it's not depicted on this chart,

11  I'm aware of that study and know that over the

course of the 24 weeks some of the smokers that switched to Snus did smoke some cigarettes.

And so this would reflect both dual use and for some individuals complete switching to Camel Snus, but in case of the biomarkers for the cancer causing compounds, there were significant reductions for all of them.  Those reductions ranged from 35 percent to 55 percent with quite a number being about 50 percent reduced by switching from the product that burns tobacco to switching to one that's low in toxicants and does not burn tobacco. Q.  You mentioned epidemiology coming out of Sweden in your description of what Camel Snus is.

16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

Reynolds' efforts to transform tobacco and migration?

A.  Epidemiology studies are long-term studies that show something about the risk for disease, smoking related diseases over time.  And epidemiology shows very clearly that in Sweden, for example, when smokers went from smoking cigarettes

9   to using Camel Snus, their risk for lung cancar was

greatly reduced and, in fact, was not different from nonsmokers.

So it's part of the information that's used to help us place products on the tobacco product risk continuum and to help us understand how

15   to transform tobacco.

Q.  I want to switch topics, Or. Borgerding, to another topic that you discussed as part of the Reynolds business strategy of transforming tobacco, and that has to do with the concept of reducing underace tobacco use.  Do vou remember tellina me about that?

A.  Yes.  I do.

Q.    What is Reynolds'   current position on whether underage people should use any tobacco product?

It's a program that has been widely used and it's been successful on a number of measures in trying to help educate middle school children about peer pressure and about decisions and about being tobacco-free.  The We Card program is one that is educating retailers about not selling tobacco

Q.  Let's look at 1991.  The youth risk behavior survey asks the question currently smoked cigarettes on at least one day during the 30 years before the � excuse me � 30 days before the survey.  In 1991 what was that percentage?

A.  In 1991 that percentage was 27.5 percent Q. And what was that percentage in 2013?

15.7 percent.

Q. And then when you compare 2011 versus 2013?

A.  In terras of the year 2011 it would have been 18.1 percent and, again, in 2013 it would have declined to 15.7 percent.

A.  In terms of daily cigarette use for eighth, tenth and twelfth graders in the year 2000, it would have been much greater than in the year 2013.  It looks like anywhere from greater than 50 percent to something that is approaching perhaps even 75 or 80 percent reductions.

q  Do�s Reynolds have a position on whether or not it wants these trends to continue?

A.  Reynolds does have a position and Reynolds' view is that they would like to see these trends accelerate. Reynolds doesn't want anyone that's a minor to use any tobacco product.

3         Q. Are you familiar with this document?

4         A.  Yes.  I am generally.

5         Q.  What is The Lancet?

6         A.  The Lancet is a journal of British and

7   foreign medicine, surgery, obstetrics, physiology,

8   chemistry, pharmacology, public health and news.  So

9   it's a long-standing scientific journal.

10         Q.    Is The Lancet a peer reviewed journal?

11         A.  It is, yes.

12         Q.  Is The Lancet a medical journal?

13         A.  It is, yes.

14         Q.  If you'll turn to the first part of the

15   article on page 742 of The Lancet, I want to read

16   the first couple of lines and ask you a question.

17 |  Dr. Johnston writes in the first sentence on the

18 J  assumption that nicotine - excuse me.  Let me start

19   over.

20            Dr. Johnston writes on the assumption that

21   smoking tobacco is essentially a means of

22   administering nicotine just as smoking opium is a

23   means of administering morphine.  Do you see that?

24         A.  I do, yes.

25                     Q.     Based on your familiarity with Dr.   Teague's

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424                                    www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

1   document we looked at a second ago, how does that

2   concept that Dr. Johnston is writing about compare

3   to Dr. Teague's view of nicotine's role in cigarette

4 J     smoke?

5         A.  They would be quite similar.  They would be

6   essentially the same.

7 I       Q.  Does Dr. Johnston in this article refer in

8   a number of places to cigarette smokers as addicts?

9         A.  Yes.  He does.

10         Q.  Does Dr. Johnston refer in a number of

11   places in this article to cigarette smoking as an

12   addiction?

13         A. Yes, in a number of instances.

14         Q.  If you'll look at the left-hand side of the

15   page in the discussion section, the last full

16   sentence starts the strength of.  Do you see that?

17         A.  I do.

18         Q.  Dr. Johnston writes the strength of an

19   addiction is measured by the difficulty in giving up

20   a drug and it is difficult indeed for the inhaler or

21   pip* smoker of many years standing to give up

22   smoking permanently.  Do you see that?

23         A.  I do see that, yes.

24 |       Q.  The concept that cigarette smoking may be



difficult to quit, are you familiar with that

A.  Yes.  They have.

19       Q.  Has Reynolds ever denied that cigarette

smoking could be difficult to quit for some smokers?

A.  No.  Reynolds has never denied that. Reynolds has indicated that it may be difficult for cigarette smokers to quit.

Q.  Does that verify that the Johnston article was cited by the '64 Surgeon General's report?

A.  Yes.  The report does cite to The Lancet article that we've been discussing a few moments ago.

Q.  Despite the fact that Dr. Johnston refers

smoking tobacco is a means of administering nicotine, what did the Surgeon General conclude with respect to whether tobacco smoking, cigarette smoking should be characterixed as an addiction or a drug habituation?

A.  The Surgeon General's report, the chapter that's excerpted here considered those various possibilities and concluded that smoking was a habit.  It was habituation.

Q.     And if you turn to page 351 �

A.  I'm there.

Q.  -- does the Surgeon General refer to its criteria at this time in 1964 for characterixing drug addictions as compared to drug habituations?

A.  Yes.  That's at the top of this page.

Q.  And using these criteria, how did the Surgeon General classify cigarette smoking and nicotine at this time?

and external position on whether nicotine was addictive compare to the Surgeon General's position during this time frame from the 1960s to the 1980s?

A.  It would have been consistent.

Q.  When Mr. Paige showed you the exhibit from Dr. Teague from 1972, do you know whether in that document Dr. Teague ever refers to nicotine or tobacco smoking as addictive?

A.  I don't believe that he did.  X would need to read it again, but my recollection is no.

Q.  Does he refer to tobacco smoking of nicotine as habituating in that exhibit?

A.  I believe he does, yes.

Q.  And would that reference in Dr. Teague's document be consistent with the Surgeon General's report in 1964?

A.  Yes.  It would.

Q.  Is Dr. Teague still with R.J. Reynolds?

A. Mo. Dr. Teague has been retired and has not been part of the company for quite a number of decades now.

4         A.  No.  Ha has not baan with the company for

6 I       Q.  You were asked some questions about when

7 |    Reynolds changed its position on whether smoking had

8   been shown to be a causa of disease earlier in the

9   deposition.  Do you racall thosa questions?

10         A.  Generally, yes.

11         Q.  Will you please explain for the jury the

12 |     scientific basis for Reynolds' historical position

13   on whether smoking had been shown to be a cause of

14 |    disease?

15 I       A.  Yes.  Historically Reynolds' scientists

16   were what I would term classically trained, that is,

17   in their scientific training they were educated to

18 I    expect before determining causation that there would

19   ba a mechanism, that there would be an understanding

20   at a scientific level of how something happens.

21            And so at the time that data in the early

22   '50s started to emerge that is epidemiology data,

23   these are data of association of statistical basis

24 I    without any attention to the details of is there a

25 |    mechanism, is there a plausible reason that what's

1   being observed is being caused.  So since that point

2   in time many things have changed.  Scientists are

3   trained differently today.

4             And also since that point in time there's

5 I    been both much more epidemiology data that's been

6   generated as well as there's been much, much more

7   research on underlying mechanisms of causes of

8 I    disease.  Much of that is summarized for the first

9   time in the Surgeon General's report in 2010, which

10   shows mechanisms for various smoking related

11   diseases.

12 I                         So we've had an evolution both in the way

13   scientists are trained, we've had an evolution in

14 I     the building of the science based around mechanism

15   and we've had an ever growing body of data from the

16   standpoint of epidemiology as well.

17         Q.  I want to ask you a similar question about

18   addiction.  At some point in time, I think, early in

19   the deposition you testified it was around the year

20   2000 that Reynolds changed its position on nicotine

21   and at that time took the public position that

22   nicotine in tobacco products was addictive.  Do you

23   recall that?

24 |       A.  I do, yes.

25                     Q.     Okay.     Will you explain Reynolds'

scientific basis for its historical position on whether smoking and nicotine were addictive prior to 2000?

4         A.  Yes.  My understanding from articles that

5   I've read that were published by Reynolds'

6 | scientists is that they looked based upon their

7 [  training in the area at the definitions for addiction and, for example, for habituation.  And based upon their training it was their scientific view, their expert opinion that, in fact, the classification that was appropriate was habituation.

They recognized that in the 1988 time frame with the Surgeon General's report that there was an evolution, a change in the definition of

15   addiction, the criteria for addiction, and that the

16   basis for the change that occurred was that evolving

17   definition.

18            And so at some point in that general time

19   frame and beyond the scientists began to accept that

20   society had also accepted that as the definition and

21   by those criteria then it was the appropriate

22   terminology.

23                     Q.     Do you know in a general sense how the

25 i     Surgeon General's report and the 1988  Surgeon

1   General's report?

2         A.  Generally, yes.  One of the changes was the

3   concept of intoxication.  I believe in 1964, for

4 I    example, part of the concept of addiction was an

5   impairment and intoxication that would occur, and

6 '     that that was no longer part of the definition that

7   was put forward in the 1988 Surgeon General's

8   report.

9         Q.  You were asked some questions earlier in

10   the deposition about the concept of a smoker's

11   choice in smoking behavior.  Do you recall those

12 '    questions?

13         A.  Generally, yes.

14         Q.  In your opinion is choice related to

15   cigarette smoking behavior?

16         A.  Yes.  It is.

17         Q.  Hill you explain that?

18         A.  Choice is part of smoking.  That is,

19 |    someone can choose to smoke.  Someone can choose to

20   have, for example, a date in which they may choose

21   to quit smoking.  And so it's part of the behavior

22   that an individual exhibits.  It's part of what

23   shapes their behavior.

24 I       Q.  Over the years have there been substantial

25 |    numbers of cigarette smokers who have quit smoking?

Q.  (By Mr. Latham)  Dr. Borgerding, I'm looking at Exhibit Number 25.  Does the CDC report on the number of current and former smokers?

a.   xes.  JLX* IS.

Q.  And if you look at the third paragraph on the CDC's website, it says since 2002 the number of former U.S. smokers has exceeded the number of current cigarette smokers.  Do you see that?

A.  I do see that, yes.

Q.  In the first paragraph it says in 2010 43.5 million adults in the United States were current smokers, 21.5 percent of men and 17.3 percent of women.  Do you see that?

A.  I do.

Q.     So based on  that can you estimate  in  terms of how many tens  of millions  the number of former smokers are  in  the U.S.   today?

A.     Yes.     This would suggest  that it's more

1   than 40 million adult smokers that have stopped

2   smoking.

3         Q.  Dr. Borgirding, are you familiar with CDC

4 |    data on the prevalence of current smoking among

5 !    adults age 18 and over? We've talked about

6   underage, but does the CDC also report data on adult

7   smokers?

8         A.  Yes.  I'm generally familiar with it.

9         Q.  Okay.  Will you look at Exhibit Number 26?

10   Gary, this is a CDC page, Figure 8.1, Prevalence of

11   Current Smoking among Adults Aga 18 and Over, United

12   States, 1997, June 2013.

13            MR. PAIGE:  Okay.

14         Q.  (By Mr. Latham)  Do you have Exhibit

15   Number 26, Dr. Borgerding?

16         A.  I do have that in front of me.

17         Q.  And what is Exhibit Number 26?

18         A.  It is something from the CDC that is a

19   chart that shows the prevalence of current cigarette

20   smoking among adults aged 18 and over in the United

21   States between 1997 and the middle of the year 2013.

22         Q.  How has the prevalence of current cigarette

23 |     smoking in the U.S. trended from 1997 to June of

24   |    2013?

25                     A.     It has declined significantly.

Q.  What was the prevalence of current smoking among U.S. adults in 1997?

A.  It was about 25 percent.

Q.  And what is the prevalence of current smoking among U.S. adults in June 2013?

A.  It's less than 20 percent, between 15 and 20 percent.

Q. If you look at the second bullet point underneath the figure, do you see a reference to 17.4 percent?

A.  I do see that, yes.

Q.  And remind the jury when the Florida settlement agreement was entered into by Reynolds.

A.  The Florida settlement agreement was in 1997.

Q.  So since the Florida settlement agreement in '97, can you quantify how much the prevalence of cigarette smoking has declined from '97 to June of 2013?

A.  The prevalence has declined on the order of 20 to 25 percentage points during that time.

Q. A couple of follow-up questions that I forgot to ask earlier about Claude Teague.  First of I  all, was Claude Teague ever the head of the Research ' Department?

A.  Ho.  He was not.

Q. Was Claude Teague ever head of the Development Department?

A.  No.  He wasn't.

Q.  Was he ever head of the Research and Development Department?

A.  No.  He never held any of those positions.

Q.  Was Claude Teague ever responsible for cigarette product development?

A.  No.  He wasn't.

Q.  You were asked some questions earlier in the deposition by Mr. Paige about whether there was a threshold level of nicotine in cigarettes for addiction. Do you recall those questions?

A.  I do generally, yea.

Q.  Is there a threshold for an amount of nicotine that's considered to be addictive?

A.  To my knowledge, no.  Again, this is an active area of research.  Recent publications, for example, have indicated that if there is such a threshold, it would be expected to vary by individual.

Q.  So if someone said Dr. Borgerding, I'd like you to design a cigarette that would contain nicotine at a nonaddictive level, would you be able

to do that?

A.  No.  I would not.

Q.  That might be it.  I want to ask you a

Assume that Reynolds was able to take all of the nicotine out of a cigarette and produce that commercially and sell it.  In your opinion would

8   that cigarette be any less risky than a cigarette

that did contain nicotine?

A.  No.  It would not be any less risky because it would still burn tobacco.  It would still have

12 |     the harmful and potentially harmful compounds in the

13   cigarette smoke that are associated with the risk

14   for disease.

15         Q.  Is nicotine considered to be a carcinogen?

16         A. No.  It's not.

17         Q.  Has the U.S. Surgeon General ever taken the

18 I    position to your knowledge that a cigarette without

19   nicotine would be a cigarette that would reduce the

20   risk for disease?

21 |       A.  No.  The Surgeon General has not taken such

a position.

Q.     In your opinion would a cigarette with no nicotine be a viable harm reduction strategy?

25                   A.    No.     I don't believe it would be.    Again,

Q.  And when was that?

A.  And that would have taken place in 2004.

Q.  2004.  So that was after this agreement?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So and when did Brown & Williamson merge with American Tobacco?  Do you know?

A.  I believe that was in 1994.  I'm not sure if merger was the exact process or one company purchased the other.

Q.  Okay.  But in any event, as of 1997 when this agreement took place, Reynolds was its own company and subsequently it acquired Brown & Williamson, who had acquired American Tobacco �

A.  That's correct.

Q.  � in 2004?

A.  That's correct, yes.

Q.  So in 1997 at the time of this settlement with the government, is it fair to say that R.J. Reynolds still had not publicly admitted that nicotine was addictive?

A.  I'm sorry.  Could you repeat that?

Q.  In 1997 when the settlement was entered into on Exhibit 18, at that time is it fair to say

that R.J. Reynolds had still not publicly admitted that nicotine was addictive?

A.  I believe at least by about the year 2000 that would have been Reynolds' position as stated, for example, on the website.  I don't know the exact time frame in there as far as in 1997 if the same statements were being made or not*

Q.     You don't know that?

A.  It would have been in that time frame that the current views would have been put forth, for example, on the web.  I don't recall specifically for 1997.

Q.  Well, you're here today as an expert witness and a fact witness and you've talked a lot about the guiding principles of your company.  Do you know when R.J. Reynolds first admitted publicly that they believed nicotine was addictive?

A.  Again, Reynolds and Reynolds' scientists have put forward their views in the scientific literature and so on for a number of years.  And in the time frame of the late '90s to around the year 2000 it would have become part of the website.  It would have been information that was declared in that manner.

Page 419 employee of R.J. Reynolds publicly admitted to the

2   consumers that they believed and knew that nicotine

3   was addictive?

4         A.  I don't know that exact date again.  I

5   think it would be the late 1990s to around the year

6   2000.

7         Q.  Okay. And the same with when they first

9   caused lung cancer.  Would that have been the late

10 ;     1990s, early 2000s as well?

11         A.  In terms of the statements that are made

14         A.  Yes.

when this agreement was entered into that those statements were not yet made publicly to the consumers; okay?

A.  I understand, yes.

Q.  Okay.  So at that time there was a settlement made where R.J. Reynolds settled with the

22 I  State of Florida.  They agreed to pay certain monies

on an annual basis as a result of a settlement in a lawsuit; right?

A. My understanding is there was a settlement

agreement.  It was entered into voluntarily by all of the parties.  I believe within the document it makes clear the voluntary actions that are agreed upon, and that happened in 1997.

Q.  Right.  So you came � you're here as a witness and you gave the chart, Exhibit 19 that we're going to talk about of all the payments that are being made.  I'm going to talk to you about all that, but you are obviously knowledgeable, I would imagine, about the settlement and the payments being made since you've testified to it on

12 '    cross-examination?

13         A.  I am generally knowledgeable, yes.

14         Q.  Okay.  So you know that there was a lawsuit

15 I    where R.J. Reynolds was a defendant and they were

18   that time, yes.

9   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

10         A.  Again, I don't have that lawsuit memorized.

11   I would need to review the lawsuit.  We do have the

12   document here that you've asked me to pull out of

13   the stack that speaks to the agreement itself and to

14   what the parties have agreed to.

16 | not being able to put any billboards within certain

17   distances of playgrounds; correct?

18         A.  I believe so, yes.

19         Q.  And it also talked about R.J. Reynolds not

20   being able to have any advertising directed to

21 I  children under the age of 18; correct?

22         A.  I'm sorry, Mr. Paige.  Which page are you

23   on?

it could ba repeated, please?

Q.  Part of the settlement was � it included was to discourage the use of tobacco products by children under the age of 18.  That was part of the purpose of the settlement; correct?

A.  Yes.  It indicates that that is one of tha focus of the settlement itself.

Q.  Okay.  But, again, at that point back in 1997 things � your guiding principles were quite different than they are today; were they not?

A.  Our guiding principles and beliefs have evolved over time.  I think that there are some differences between those time periods, but the company would have been trying to achieve many of the same things at that point in time.

Q.  Hell, back then when you entered into this settlement with the State of Florida, on page 15 part of the settlement was that this agreement was to be kept not admissible in other lawsuits; right?

A.  I'm sorry.  Where are you referring to it on page 15?

Q.  On page 15, subsection C, there's a nonadmissibility clause where the parties agreed � can you read that for the record, subsection C, please?

A.  Subsection C is nonadmissibility.  It states these settlement negotiations have been undertaken by the parties in good faith and for settlement purposes only and neither this settlement agreement nor any evidence of negotiations hereunder shall be offered or received in evidence in this action or any other action or proceeding for any purpose other than in an action or proceeding arising under this settlement agreement.

A.  I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that question,

4         Q.  Okay.  So you were � so just to rehash, in

5   the 1990s you were sued by the State of Florida;

6   correct?

7         A.  That's my understanding, yes.

8         Q. R.J. Reynolds was not yet part of American

9   Tobacco or Brown 6 Williamson; correct?

10         A.  R.J. Reynolds has never been part of those

11 E    companies, but the sequence of events that we

12 '    discussed in an earlier answer had not yet occurred.

13         Q.  Okay.  R.J. Reynolds agreed to pay large

14   sums of money to the State of Florida to settle the

15   claims that were being made against them; correct?

16         A.  Per this agreement for the purposes stated

i

A.  I do see that, yes.

Q.  You understand that Mr. Wilcox was not a party to this agreement; right?

A.  I don't believe that he is, no.

Q.  Or Mr. Schleider; correct?

A.  He's not to my knowledge.

g  They didn't get any money from this lawsuit; did they?

A.  I don't -- I don't have one way to know that either way.  I don't believe that they did, but I don't know.

Q.  He has it.  So after the settlement these are the numbers that R.J. Reynolds had to pay. These are the numbers that R.J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson had to pay on behalf of American Tobacco. They're all combined there; correct?

A.  Yes.  These would be the sums for the current entity of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

Q.  Right.  So after 1997 it was still feasible and profitable for R.J. Reynolds to purchase Brown & Williamson and take on their obligation and American Tobacco's obligation; correct?

A.  I'm not sure I followed your question. There was a merger of Brown & Williamson and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 2004.  I'm presuming that that was deemed in the best interests of all of the owners or shareholders of those companies and that it strengthened the situation from a company standpoint to have them combined.

Q.  Right.  That's what I'm saying. Despite having to pay R.J. Reynolds' share of the settlement, R.J. Reynolds had to pay the share of Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco and it still strengthened the position of Reynolds and that's why that took place?

A.  If I'm following you, I don't think I would

agree with what you're putting forward in that it's quite likely that, in fact, the position had weakened for all the companies because of these sorts of things I would put forward and that that was ~~ may well have been, I don't know, one of the drivers for the companies ending up having to combine. Now, as far as the companies combining �

Q.    Are you speculating? Did that happen? Are you just guessing or did that really happen?

A. Well, what Z know is billions of dollars have been paid, many billions of dollars.  The number of cigarettes sold is greatly declined.  I think from a business standpoint anytime companies combine either through a merger or through one comoanv ourchasincr another it is for reasons of strengthening the new entity as compared to the individual parts that existed before that.

Q.  For example, you paid 100 � you paid 97 million last year on behalf of R.J. Reynolds, American and Brown & Williamson; correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And last year Reynolds Tobacco made over a billion dollars in profits; correct?

A.  I don't know those figures.  Reynolds American is the parent company and I think figures

for that company would exist, but as far as Reynolds Tobacco, I don't know the figures.

Q.  Well, did you know that last year Reynolds Tobacco had net sales of about $6.7 billion?

A.  Again, I don't know all of those financial -- all of that financial information.  I would have to review a 10-Q or some other document.

Q. Do you know what the profits of Reynolds American were last year?

A.  I don't know those as I sit here, no.

Q.  Do you know that it was over a billion dollars?

A.  I'm sorry?

Q.  Do you know that it's over a billion dollars?

A.  I believe that's possible but, again, I would need to review those documents.

Q.  When is the last time you reviewed the profitability of Reynolds Tobacco?

A.  I see news reports and so on when they come out.  I see press releases from time to time,  I'm more focused in my day-to-day job on transforming tobacco.

Q.  Okay.  But you're a shareholder; correct?

questions in trials or depositions about the profitability of these companies?

6   that follows or understands those documents

7   particularly.  That's not my area of expertise.

8         Q.  Okay.  Without asking the exact figures,

9   despite the settlement with the State of Florida, do

10   you know whether Reynolds Tobacco has been profiting

11   over a billion dollars a year?

12         A. Again, I would have to review all the

13   figures.  Reynolds has been profitable for a number

14   of years.

15         Q.  And the same with Reynolds American;

17 |       A.  Well, again, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

19   American is a publicly traded company. My

correct?

A.  No.  That's not correct.

Q.  They do not?

A.  They don't own British American Tobacco.

Q.  Who owns British � who owns British American Tobacco?

A,  British American Tobacco is the best of my knowledge a publicly traded company.  I believe the shareholders of that company own it.

Q.  And does British American Tobacco own Reynolds American?

A.  No.  They don't own Reynolds American. They are a shareholder within Reynolds American.

Q. Okay.  So British American is a shareholder of Reynolds American?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And do you know what percentage of Reynolds American British American Tobacco owns?

A.  I believe that British American Tobacco owns 42 percent of Reynolds American stock.

Q.  Right, okay.  So there is a relationship between British American Tobacco and Reynolds American and Reynolds Tobacco that you're familiar with?

A.  If by that you mean they own 42 percent of

the shares of stock, yes.

Q. They are the biggest shareholder of Reynolds American; correct?

A.  They are the single largest shareholder is my understanding, but they1re not the majority shareholder.

Q.  Okay.  And then Reynolds American also owns Niconovum; correct?

A.  Yes.  Reynolds American owns Niconovum.

Q.  And then on 215, Oem 215, which was Exhibit 4, if you can find that for a moment? This says Zonnic is marketed to empower smokers to succeed in quitting. Do you see that?

A.  Yep.  I have it now, Mr. Paige.

Q. Okay. Mow, Zonnic is marketed to empower smokers to succeed in quitting. Is that the slogan of Zonnic?

A.  I don't know all of the marketing materials for Zonnic.  I believe there's a � on this demonstrative there's a picture of Zonnic, for example, but that is at least part of the concept around any NRT is that nicotine replacement therapy products are intended to help smokers that would

A.  Yes.  It is an FDA approvad product for helping smokers to stop smoking.

A. Again, my understanding is that nicotine replacement therapy products help some smokers to stop smoking.

Q.  So does R.J. Reynolds consider Zonnic to be of benefit to some addicted customers of theirs?

A.  Yes.  Again, my understanding is that nicotine replacement therapy products are intended to help people that would like to quit to stop smoking and that some people that use nicotine replacement theraov products do indeed stop  Some ao not.

Q. Right, okay. So Zonnic has a success with some addicted smokers, but some addicted smokers, it does not help them?

	Q.  So do you understand why I'm asking you
	

5
	about Zonnic specifically now?
	

6
	A.  I believe I do, although I believe the
	

7
	answer to the question is the same.  Zonnic, like
	

8
	all nicotine replacement therapy, is effective for
	

9
	some smokers, but not all smokers find nicotine
	

10
	replacement therapy to be something that helps them

	Q.  But all those products have some benefit to

indicated are nicotine replacement therapy products and that for each of those products, some smokers that would like to quit find that to be something that helps them to quit smoking; but for some smokers that smoke, those products that you named don't necessarily help them stop smoking.

Q.  How is Zonnic different than � is Zonnic better than Chantix?

A.  I don't know how you would define better. I've indicated in earlier answers to Mr. Latham about some of the ways in which Zonnic is different, some of the things that are on the demonstrative that you've asked me to pull up.  I can go through again, but it is different in certain ways in terms of how it's made available to smokers*

Q.  Other than how it's made available, is there anything about Zonnic that makes it more effective than say Nicorette gum?

A.  Again, in addition to how it's made available, the quantities and price points, if you consider all that to be how it's available, then those would be the general differences.

Q.  So Zonnic is pretty much the same as the Nicorette gum or the patch, but it's just less expensive?

A.  Well, Zonnic is � first of all, Zonnic is a gum.  So Zonnic gum like other NRT gums, it's the same concepts as far as NRT.  It's the same FDA review and approval of the product or the technology



5   itself.

The difference with Zonnic is that it is made available to smokers at a price point that would compete with cigarettes in locations where they would be choosing between cigarettes or NRT and in a means that is intended to help them stop smoking if they would like to.

Q.  And then it says Zonnic, one less cigarette, one more victory.  Do you see that?

A.  I do see that, yes.

Q.  Why is that important?

A.  Well, the key is for a smoker that would like to stop smoking to in this manner encourage them to keep pursuing it, to keep working towards their goal and to use this approach to stop smoking.

Q.  So every cigarette has a certain amount of

21 i    carcinogens; correct?

22         A.  You're asking about within the cigarette or

23   in cigarette smoke?

Cigarette smoke in general would contain many thousands of compounds as I've indicated earlier. Some of those would be harmful and potentially harmful compounds such as carcinogens.

Q.  So one less cigarette, one more victory, is that why you have that motto or that phrase there?

A.  I'm not a marketer, so I can't really speak to the Zonnic marketing per se other than to say it's � it would appear that it's trying to encourage those that would like to quit smoking to stop and to realize that that's a process and to be persistent in that.

Q. When Mr. Wilcox was alive did you have that marketing theme, one less cigarette, one more victory, for him?

A.  Nicotine replacement therapy products are generally more recent than that and, no, this product would not have existed in the United States at that time.

Q.  No. Did Reynolds have a similar motto for their cigarettes or any product that they marketed when Mr. Wilcox was alive similar to the one that said one less cigarette, one more victory?

A.  No.  This � again, this isn't a Reynolds statement to begin with.  It's a Zonnic statement,

but no, Reynolds didn't have that statement.

Q.    Did Reynolds ever have a statement similar to one less cigarette, one more victory when Mr. Schleider was alive and smoking your product?                      |

A.  Not those words, no.  This is for a nicotine replacement therapy product.

Q.  Now, you talked about the decrease in youth smoking at some point.  Do you remember that?

A.  Yes.  X do.

Q.  And you also -- so you were talking about how the percentages of teenagers who smoke have gone down in our country from � it looks like from in 1991 it was about twenties.  If you look at Exhibit 14, if you would bring that up?

nay not � it may be stuck to another one. THE WITNESS:  We'll find it here. MR. LATHAM:  That's it, yes. Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  All right.  Ready, Doctor? A.  Almost.  Okay.  I have 26, I have 2 and I have 14.

Q.  Okay.  Let's start with two.  So if you

9   look at Number 2, it talks about Reynolds' annual

cigarette volume.  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.  I do.

Q.  You have that great big line in 1997 and that little teeny line in 2013.  Do you see that?

A.  I do, yes.

Q.  And so it looks like in 2013 if you would put that on the 1997 bar, it's probably about one � it's probably about -- looks like it's about five percent of that bar, right, the size of it, the 2013

19  versus the '97?

A.  Well, no.  As I indicated in my answer to Mr. Latham, if you look at the scale here, it goes from 60 to 200.  So we're looking based on 1997 �

Q.  Well, sir �

A.  � and 2013.

Q.  Sir, I'm just asking you, we could measure

it in front of the jury if we have to.  I'm just asking you.  The way that you did this graph or the way this graph is prepared, it looks like � the 2013 box looks like it's about five percent of the size of the 1997 graph.  Do you see that?

A.  If you're asking in terms of the heights of the bars, yes.  I see what you're saying.  You are saying that the 2013 bar which reflects about �5 billion is small because the scale starts at 60 billion.

Q.  Right.  So it's kind of misleading?

A.  Well, again, Mr. Paige, as I indicated to Mr. Latham, the 65 billion as compared to the 195 billion is approximately a third.  So it's about 60, 65 percent reduced.

Q.  Right.  So the real size difference is about a third, about 33 percent; right?

A.  The numeric difference is that there's been a reduction of about 60 to 65 percent during that time period, so about two-thirds reduction, about a third remaining.

Q.  Right. And we know there's several reasons for that that you and I have spoken about before, one of which is that the average consumption of cigarettes or nicotine � well, strike that.  The

avaraga consumption of cigarettes has gone from about 20 to 22 cigarattaa in tha '90s to about 13 cigarettes currently, correct, per smoker?

A.  We have discussed that concept in the earlier part of the deposition, and without trying to discuss tha enact figures which could vary from study to study, yes.  The data I would suggest are quite clear that there's been a reduction in tha avaraga cigarattaa, numbar of cigarattaa smokad par day.

Q.  Okay.  And than we also know that tha smoking rates have gone down, too, not only for teenagers but for all smokers have decreased in our country from at some points they were at SO percent and now they're down to about 18 percent in our country; correct?

A.  Again, generally, yes, without trying to focus on the specific numbers you spoke about that waa also in documents and questions from Mr. Latham, but tha incidanca of smoking is greatly reduced today compared to in the past.

Q,  Okay.  So when we talked about teenage smoking, there's two things that we can talk about is, one, what percentage of smokers start when they're a teenager.  That's one concept; correct?

And the other *-~

A.  That is a concept unto itself.

Q.  Okay.  And when you and I were talking about that last time where it's been reported that up to 90 percent of all smokers start by the age of 18; right?

A.  There have been a wide range of reports, but I believe there have been reports generally like that, yes.

Q. Okay. And that's still the case today; correct?

A. Again, as far as a specific value, I would need to go and review the literature.  I told you in the first part of the deposition my general impressions and understanding with what I've read, not everything that I've read would support the figure that you're putting forward.

Q.     Okay.  But a lot of what you read does support that; correct?

A.  I think it would depend upon the time frame and it would depend upon the definitions, but clearly there would be support for the concept that many smokers and especially depending on the time frame may have started in those years, yes.

the decline of youth smoking. Another would be around the area of harm reduction.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  Harm reduction means to not -- try to prevent so many people from dying, from getting sick?

A.  Yes.  Again, for cigarette smokers specifically, especially those concerned about the risks of smoking, to provide them either other tobacco products if they don't want to stop using tobacco or to have them consider nicotine replacement therapy as a means of quitting cigarette smoking.

Q.  Okay.  So as a maker of cigarettes, do you

as teenagers currently? Currently in the current market of smokers, how many of them started as teenagers?

A.  As far as the current smokers, I don't know the exact figure. As I've indicated now in earlier answers, I think that it probably depends somewhat on what you read and which definition. Clearly a significant number did.

Q.  Okay.  So that � so that's one concept. And then the other concept is what percentage of teenagers as a whole are smoking today as opposed to

previously; correct?

A.  The data that we looked at from the CDC website earlier was focused on that point, yes.

Q.  Okay.  So we know that because of reasons that we've discussed, well, for a variety of reasons � well, strike that. We know that after the master settlement agreement there's been a lot of marketing to the public about the harms of smoking; correct?

A.  I'm not sure exactly what you mean by that. I think there's been information about the harms of smoking throughout our society in many different forms for many years before and after the master

Q.  That wasn't my question.  I'll move to strike that.  I'll rephrase that.  You know part of

Florida, I mean, we have that here as an exhibit. We can look at that specifically, but my understanding of the master settlement agreement is that that was one of the premises put forward by the various states is that they would use the money in part for that reason.

Q. Okay*  So now we have a decrease in smoking in our country not only with teenagers but with adults, with everybody the smoking population has decreased in our country in the last, you know, 10 to 15 to 20 years?

A.  It's actually been decreasing for quite a number of decades.

Q.  Okay.  Tou were showing the decrease of teenage smoking from 27-and-a-half percent on Exhibit 14 in 1991 to 15.7 percent in 2013.  Do you see that?

A.  Yes.  I do.

Q.  There is also a decrease in adult smokers during the same time period; right?

A.  They're both in this time period and prior to that, which we looked at in a different exhibit, there's been a general decrease in smoking for many years even before that.  He looked at that in a different exhibit, but both adult smoking and youth

A.  Smoking in general has been declining. Youth smoking has been declining according to the various statistics that we've looked at in earlier questions and answers.  Both have been declining.

Q.  Do you know that � do you know that part of the reason, a big part of the reason for the decrease in smoking in our country is because of the litigation that your company has been exposed to?

A.  That is not my understanding.  I think that there have been declines in smoking for quite a wide range of reasons.  There's been education about the risks of smoking throughout most of my entire lifetime.

There have been increases in taxation and the cost of cigarettes.  There's been changes in laws in terms of where people can smoke.  My

understanding is all of those have been drivers of the general decline in the incidence of smoking and the number of cigarettes that people smoke per day. None of those is litigation.  1 don't think litigation personally has anything to do with a smoker's decision.  It's the other factors that I've

A.  R.J. Reynolds to my knowledge hasn't taken a specific position about this particular part of the Surgeon General's report.  What R.J.

the high cost of verdicts or settlements to

9  manufacturers, which results in reduced consumption

of tobacco products, particularly among youth.

Q.  And does R.J. Reynolds agree with that or disagree or not have a position?

A.  My answer is the same as previously for any individual piece of a Surgeon General's report.  I'm unaware of a specific position.  The company has a guiding principle and belief about Surgeon General's reports in their entirety. And it indicates that for smokers concerned about the risks of smoking, that they should consider the conclusions of the Surgeon General in making decisions about smoking.

21        Q.  Right, but R.J. Reynolds you said really

wants there to be a reduced consumption of tobacco products, particularly among young people; correct? That's what you want; right?

minors to use any tobacco products and would like to see the decline in youth smoking accelerate, yes.

Q. And so that's a good thing when that happens; right?

A.  Pardon?

q.  That's a good thing when there's a decrease or decline in youth smoking; right?

A.  Yes.  It's something that the company would like to see accelerate.  We don't want anyone that's a minor to use tobacco products.

Q. Right.  So the Surgeon General says that litigation when successful can lead to increases in price due to the high cost of verdicts or settlement to the manufacturers, which results in reduced consumption, particularly among youth.  So that is a good thing; right?

A. Again, if by a good thing you mean that youth should not use tobacco products, that minors should never use tobacco products, the company agrees they should never do that. As far as the concept of pricing, it's not about pricing.

The company would like to see, first of all, laws around possession of tobacco products be something that would keep anyone that's a minor from using tobacco products.  And to begin with, we don't

want anyone to sell tha products to minors.  So it's not about what the prica should be.  It's about not selling it to anyone that's a minor, not of legal age and having appropriate penalties for when that does occur.

Q. And then the next bullet, if you could read that, please, Doctor?

A.  The next bullet says very large punitive damages hava the potential to encourage manufacturers to examine their practices and change behaviors that could trigger such monetary sanctions, and it has a table*

Q.  Does R.J. Reynolds agree with that, disagree or not have a position on that?

A.  Again, it's true for all statements within the report.  Reynolds to my knowledge doesn't have a position on any individual statement but does have a position about Surgeon General's reports. And that is smokers concerned about the risks of smoking should rely upon those conclusions when making decisions about smoking.

A.  Again, as I indicated in my answer to Mr. Lathan earlier, Mr. Galloway was the head of the company and Dr. Senkus was the head of research.

this document is that it speaks for itself in terms of what Mr. Galloway was indicating to Dr. Senkus.

What I know is that, in fact, as indicated in an answer to one of Mr. Latham's questions, Dr. Senkus did indeed interact with the federal government in a very lengthy research program to try

8 I and understand technologies that could reduce

9   exposure to compounds in cigarette smoke and reduce the biological activity of cigarette smoke to try

11 I and create safer cigarettes.

12 |       Q.  Okay.  My question to you is more general.

13 | Is it your testimony under oath that R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Brown t Williamson and American Tobacco have been cooperative and forthright with the Surgeon General?

A. With the Surgeon General, my understanding is the Surgeon General has compiled reports and so on and has cited to literature from Reynolds' scientists.  I'm not aware that the Surgeon General has provided offers or opportunities to collaborate on particular pieces of science as such.

Q.  So is the answer yes, no or you don't know?

24 |       A.  I believe that I answered the question.  To

my knowledge the Surgeon General isn't one that

Q.  Okay.  So they've been cooperative with the � for example, the tobacco working group?  Is it your testimony under oath that they were forthright and cooperative with the tobacco working group?

A.     I'm not sure about all those adjectives. They were an active participant and worked in the tobacco working group throughout those years with the federal government, the representatives there. They provided products per agreement in terms of being able to do research, yes.  They were active research partners throughout that entire process.

Q.  Do you think they were sharing their internal research and their internal documents with the Surgeon General and the tobacco working group?

A.  I think that they were sharing the science that was generated for many, many different kinds of products throughout the five volumes of the reports of that work that looked at all of the different kinds of technologies that had been considered. They were working with scientists that were part of

compounds in cigarette smoke aa alao identified as carcinogens.  Do you see that?

A.  I do see the second page, yes.

Q.  And it's talking about compounds � well, what is that list, Doctor?

A.  It is a list of various compounds.  I can merely indicate what it has here, which is a title that says partial list of compounds in cigarette smoke also identified as carcinogens.  It also seems to have beside some of the compounds various numbers of pluses.

In reviewing this quickly I'm not of the view necessarily that all of these would be considered carcinogens today by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, but I would need to review that in more detail.

g okay. But you don't deny that there's roughly 70, at least 70 different carcinogens in cigarette smoke; do you?

A.  There are many thousands of compounds in cigarette smoke.

Q.  Carcinogens?

A.  I'm sorry.  I thought you just asked about compounds.  In terms of carcinogens, there would be approximately that number that have been reported to

Q.  How many?

A.  On the order of 70 to 80.

Q.  And then on the next page, Doctor, do you see where it talks about reduction of carcinogens in smoke? Do you see that?

A.  I see on the next page that that's the title of the section that's on the page, yes.

Q. And can you read the two highlighted portions, please?

A.  The first highlighted portion says carcinogens are found in practically every class of compounds in smoke.

Q.  And the next one?

A.  The next one says present technology does not permit selective filtration of particulate smoke.

Q.  Okay.  So this is a 1961 research report at Philip Morris where they're talking about carcinogens found in practically every class of smoke and then technology does not permit the filtration of that; correct?

A. It doesn't seem to be a report. It's a presentation based on the title on the front page and it does indicate that present technology doesn't

permit selective filtration of particulate smoke.

Q.  Okay.

A.  So if you're suggesting that the technologies of that time, that is, general reduction technologies don't filter particulate smoke, then I would not agree that it's saying that.

Q. And then so you � I don't even understand your answer to be honest with you, Doctor.

A.  I'm happy to explain.

Q.  I have no idea -- well, let me just see. Did you understand my question?

A.  Well, I took your questions based upon the words that you used to form the question to suggest that this was indicating that particulate material in smoke could not be filtered.

Q.  Okay.

A.  Was that your question?

Q.  Philip Morris in their research presentation indicated that it was their finding that present technology does not permit selective filtration of particulate smoke; correct?

A.  That's the statement, yes.

MR. LATHAM:  Yeah.  I think I just had it delivered to me.

MR. PAIGE:  Okay.

MR. LATHAM:  Is this the one that's 976?

MR. PAIGE:  Yes.

MR. LATHAM:  Okay.  It hasn't been marked yet, just needs to be marked.

MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  So that will be 32?

THE COURT REPORTER:  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So now you have Exhibit 32, and can you just road the highlighted portion of that document? You can start with the word Finch that's not highlighted.

A.  That sentence or part says Finch agrees submission Battelle or Griffith developments to Surgeon General undesirable.

Q.  Do you know whether � regardless of whether it was desirable or undesirable, do you know whether that July 17th private confidential memo was actually provided to the Surgeon General in cooperation with their report, the upcoming report?

A.  I don't know.

MR. PAIGE:  And then I want to go over to the next exhibit, which is 33 and 34, that have to do with the tobacco working group.  Are they marked, 33 and 34?

THE WITNESS:  They are not, but I ~ are they PT 02286?

MR. PAIGE:  Well, 33 is just a March 27th

letter.

THE WITNESS:     Okay.     March  27th,   1968? MR.   PAIGE:     Yes.     And  -~

7           Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  And this all started really

8    we were talking about a memo from Murray Senkus or

9    to Murray Senkus.  This is an actual letter written

Q.     And so and this is written to who?

19          A.  Yes.  The second paragraph says I am

20    agreeable to serving on the informal work group

21    referred to by you and making available my

22    experience and knowledge and research relating to

23    tobacco and smoking if it is clearly understood that

2   the development of human lung cancer.  Xt is

important that this reservation be noted

4 |     particularly in light of the unfortunately

5    designated purpose of the group, namely, to develop

6    a less hazardous cigarette.

7               Perhaps a better working arrangement and

8    understanding by all involved would be achieved if

9    the purpose were rephrased in a manner that would

10    not assume the existence of a hazard that has not

11    been scientifically established.

12 I       Q.  So in reading this paragraph, it seems that

13    Dr. Sankus does not believe that cigarettes are

14    hazardous; correct?

15               MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

16               THE WITNESS:  My understanding from

17    reading the paragraph is that he's asking that a

18    conclusion not be drawn until the work of the years

19 |      that would ensue, all of the extensive research that

20    was actually embarked upon came to bear and then

21    perhaps a conclusion could be drawn in that regard,

22 i     but at that point the work hadn't been done.

23               And so at that point he was putting

24    forward the view that it should be a research

25 J     program that would lead to some conclusion.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  All right.  Well, he says, quote, I am in no manner accepting the view that present cigarettes are hazardous.  Do you see that?

A.  I see that he states his personal view there, yes.

Q.  Okay.  So if he had a personal view that cigarettes were not hazardous at that time in 1968, do you agree that it would not be unreasonable for Mr. Wilcox to have had the same view?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  Mr. Wilcox at Philip Morris? Is that who � I'm not -- are you referring to Mr. Endicott?

MR. PAIGE:  ITm sorry.  Mr. Wilcox, the unfortunate � the customer of R.J. Reynolds who died from smoking.

THE WITNESS:  In terms of Mr. Wilcox, I'm not sure of what information he had, what he had read in that time frame.  In 1968, of course, there had been many, many different things in newspaper articles and Reader's Digests for a number of years.

There had been quite a bit of information provided from many different sources.  So I don't know what his view was or what information he would have relied upon to form his view, but there was

1   quite a bit of information that had been available

2   for many yaars about the potential risks of smoking.

3   In terms of Dr. Senkus, he states his personal view

4 I and yet he participates actively in the effort to

5 ' evaluate the science.

6         Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  Okay.  But there was not

7   enough information out there to convince Or. Senkus

8   that cigarettes are hazardous at least as of 1968;

9   correct?

10         A. Again, he makes the statements about his

11   views as we've read.

12         Q.    And then he goes on to say he feels that in

13   light of the unfortunate designated purpose of the

14   group, namely, to develop a less hazardous

15   cigarette.  Do you see that?

16         A.  Yes.

17         Q.  In what world would it be unfortunate to

18   try to develop a less hazardous cigarette? How

19   could that possibly be unfortunate?

20         A.  Well, I don't believe that Dr. Senkus is

21   suggesting that that would be unfortunate. He's

22   speaking very specifically as it says to the name of

23   the group. The actual activity of the group was to

24   investigate a wide range of technologies to try and

25   reduce compounds such as carcinogens in smoke and to

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

reduce the biological activity of smoke.  So there's nothing here that says Dr. Senkus didn't think that that effort was appropriate.  He participated in it. He's merely putting his views forward about the name of the group.

Q.  That's what you think that means?

A.  That's the words that I see upon this page, yes.

Q.  Okay.  That's what those words mean to you, he just has a problem with the name?

A.  Yes.  I mean, to your question and, again, I don't know what was in his mind, but I do know that if he had said these things and refused to be part of it and not provide his scientific expertise, that would suggest something entirely differently to me.

Q.  Do you know why it was advantageous to have representatives from the cigarette industry -- well, strike that.  Do you know why it was advantageous to the cigarette industry to have insiders on the tobacco working group?

A.  The federal government decided upon the form and structure, what I know from the reports that I've read of the activities there.  The manufactures provided scientific input, scientific

Q.  But this is a statement from the Tobacco Institute.  You understand R.J. Reynolds' involvement with the Tobacco Institute; don't you?

A.  I don't know a lot about the Tobacco Institute.  I know that it existed, but I don't know details about it as such.

Q. Do you know the relationship batwaan R.J. Reynolds and tha Tobacco Institute?

A.  I baliava that thara ware various members or not members but individuals that contributed to that.  For example, tha Tobacco Institute part of that was a testing laboratory that came about when the Federal Trade Commission laboratory was dissolved, but I don't know all the aspects of the Tobacco Institute.

Q.  Do you know where they got � do you know who funded the Tobacco institute?

A. I believe tobacco companies. I don't know if others did as well or not.

Tobacco Institute; correct?

A.  I believe that to be true, yes.

Q.  And so the Tobacco Institute is issuing a press release saying that the number one health problem is not smoking, but it's the extent to which the public health officials may knowingly mislead the American public. Did I read that correctly?

A.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't following along.  I'd read the statement that you asked me to earlier, which was the first part of it.  It's attributed to a particular person and as it's as I read into the record earlier.

Q.  If you didn't hear my question, I'll ask it again.  I just want to make sure we're talking about the same thing.  Do you see where the Tobacco Institute is accusing public health officials of misleading the American public?

A. Again, if you're -- I'm not sure exactly. It doesn't say accusing.  It says � it has a particular individual, a vice president and counsel is the title, and it expresses some opinions of that individual in that first sentence as best I can read

My understanding, first of all, is I don't know all of the funding that may or may not have gone on. It's my understanding that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company would have provided funds to the Tobacco Institute.  I don't know the details of that.

Q. No problem. The jury will hear the details from some other witness, but you understand at least there's some relationship with R.J. Reynolds and the Tobacco Institute. The extent of it you're not fully aware of. Fair enough?

A.  That's correct.  I don't know the details.

Q. And we do know that the Vice President and Counsel for the Tobacco Institute on February 26th was a gentleman by the name of J.C.B. Ehringhaus, Jr.; correct?

A.  I don't know the background of this particular press release.  I don't know if it's something that he did on his own or not.  It's cl<sarly citing him m9  SOmeone that's part � that has a position with the Tobacco Institute.

Q. Okay.  So maybe he's issuing his own press

A. Again, I don't know the background of it.

Q. Is that what you're telling � is that what you're telling us you think is going on here, that he's just issuing his own individual press releases in his own individual capacity?  Is that what you really think?

A.  If you're asking me about what it says here, I can answer that for you, Mr. Paige.  If

you're asking me about the background of this document, I don't have those details.

Q.  Actually, I did ask you that.  I did ask you that and you went on to answer something else. So my question to you, most respectfully, Doctor, was merely that it says that today the 1972 report of the Surgeon General and Congress on smoking and health insults the scientific community.  Is that what the press release stated?

A.  Again, Mr. Paige, what I'm reading here, it says in quotes, it's attributing a direct quote to this individual.  And in terms of that quote, it's what you just indicated.  It says, quote, insults the scientific community.

Q.  Okay. And then it goes on to say, quotes,

16  the number one health problem is not cigarette

smoking but it is the extent to which the public health officials may knowingly mislead the American public. Did I read that correctly?

A.  Tes.  You read the second quotation attributed to Mr. Bhringhaua.

Q.  Okay.  Do you think it would be wrong to knowingly mislead the American public about the health effects of smoking?

A.  I believe that this is indicating this

person's opinion.  I think it's quite clear that it's being characterized as their opinion.

Q.  Do you know whether it would be wrong to knowingly mislead the American public about the health effects of smoking?

A.  I don't think that in terms of misleading, I don't believe that that should be the approach that's taken as far as the science and so on that should be conducted and considered.  In terms of someone's opinion if they're offering their opinion, it is whatever it is.

Q.  Okay.  I'm going to ask you again because I'm not asking � I'm asking for your opinion, Doctor.  Do you think as an expert and fact witness knowing what you know about cigarette smoke and people dying,  do you think it would be wrong to mislead the public about the health effects of smoking?

A.  As a scientist I think that it would be appropriate to have scientific studies, to have scientific data and to have healthy debate.  That's what science is about.

Q.  Well, let me ask you again.  As a human being knowing what you know, do you think it would be wrong to mislead the American public about the

MR. LATHAM:  Object to tha form. THE WITNESS:  Again, I believe the appropriate thing to do is to put scientific information forward and to have scientific discussion about what it means and to see if consensus can develop.  I'm not sure what you mean by misleading as far as all the data that's available, all the many things in the press about risks.

There was a tremendous amount of information available.  I think that that's something that all individuals should consider, all those sources of information.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  Do you know what it means, do you know what it means to knowingly mislead the public about the health effects of smoking? Do you know what that means?

A.  I'm not sure exactly what you mean by it, no.

Q.  Okay.  You don't know what it means.  Okay. If you don't know what it means, you just tell me you don't know what it means.

Do you know what the word knowingly means?

A.  I do believe I understand each of the words that you used.  I'm not sure what you're trying to suggest it means.

Q.  I'm not suggesting anything.  I want to know do you know what the word mislead means?

A.  I believe I do.

Q. Okay. Do you know about the adverse health effects of smoking?

A.  I believe over time, yes, there's been much science in that regard.

Q. Do you know as you sit here today what can happen if people smoke?

A.  Today, yes.  There's been a tremendous amount of science conducted, many reports about various adverse health effects.

Q.  Do you think -- do you think it would be wrong to knowingly mislead the American public about the health risks of smoking?

A.  It's my view that if it's a scientist, if it's a company, they should put their views forward, whatever those views are. And all of that should be I eouite.dtog.th.>. Th. fact that two diff.r.nt 24 , entities may have different views doesn't mean that

You know what the word knowingly means and you know what the word mislead means. We've already established that. And you, obviously, should know what � you know what the truth is; right?

A*  I know all those things, yes.

Q.  You know all those things; don't you? Okay.  So if somebody has a truthful view, I'm asking you about when somebody has an honest view, would it be wrong for that person to not tell the public that view but to give them another view in an intention to knowingly mislead them about the health problem of smoking? Do you understand that or you really don't understand what I'm asking you?

A,  I think I do, but you're mixing � you keep mixing and putting words together that, quite honestly, I think aren't as straightforward as you're suggesting.  Let me �

A. No.  I don't think that anyone should lie about the health effects.

A.  No.  Again, I think views should be put forward in a straightforward manner, whatever they are.

Q.  I don't understand what you're talking about.  I'm asking do you think it would be okay to intentionally mislead the American public about the health effects of smoking? Do you think that's okay or not okay?

A.  I believe I've answered that now several times. No, views should be put forward in a straightforward manner.

Q.  Okay.  That's what I thought.  I agree with that.  So that being said, it takes a long time to get you to answer, you know, the question.

Maybe it's my question that's the problem, but in any event, in this press release this Mr. Ehringhaus, the Vice President of the Tobacco Institute, said that the number one health problem is not cigarette smoking but it's the extent to which the public health officials may knowingly mislead the American public.  Did I read that correctly?

A.  The next part says while the strategy was brilliantlv conceived and executed over the vears helping us win important battles, it is only fair to say that it is not nor was it intended to be a vehicle for victory.

And doing that in a straightforward manner, I think that would be appropriate.  If that information was not being provided out of the tobacco working group, for example, I don't think that would be appropriate.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I don't know that this document speaks to that.  I'd have to read through it.  In terms of the statistical association that is a risk, I don't believe that Reynolds has ever suggested that there wasn't a risk.  I think that as far as causation, the term causation, there was the

concept of a mechanism; but as far as there being no risk of smoking, I don't think that that was the intention.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  Okay.  Go to page � the second page. And if you go under the strategic impasse, there is a highlighted section there under

7   cigarette controversy.  Do you see that?  Can you

read that paragraph, please?

A.  In the middle of the page the paragraph says in the cigarette controversy the public, especially those who are present and potential supporters, for example, tobacco state congressmen and heavy smokers, must perceive, understand and believe in evidence to sustain their opinions that

15   smoking may not be the causal factor.

Q.  But now, but today you want heavy smokers to believe and understand that smoking is a causal factor in lung cancer; don't you?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  Today our guiding principle and belief is that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.  I think, obviously, the statistics show that that's in some smokers, not for all; but yes, that there is a lot of information about mechanism. It's generally accepted that smoking is a cause of

lung cancer.

Q. (By Mr. Paiga) Wall, it's baan generally accepted that smoking is a cause of lung cancer for over 50 years?

A.  I think that that has evolved over that time frame.  I believe 50 years ago there would have been many scientists both inside and outside of the industry that would not necessarily have felt that that was true.

They may have indicated that there was risk and that the data may eventually lead to such a determination, but the science at that point in time wasn't sufficient to determine causation.

Q.  Sir, the scientists were � if you take away the scientists inside of the industry and you take away the scientists outside the industry who are receiving funding from the industry, would you agree that virtually everybody, every reputable scientist for the last 50 years has understood and agreed that smoking causes lung cancer?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  That's not my understanding in terms of 50 years ago. My understanding is that there were a number of prominent scientists.  I don't have any knowledge that they had any funding.

I think they were completely independent of the industry, did not believe that cigarette amoking had been shown scientifically to cause lung cancer* The science of 50 years ago is far different than our level of knowledge today.

Q.     (By Mr. Paige)  So you think there was no scientific conaensua that amoking caused lung cancer in the '50s; correct?

scientists that � some that believed that it was so, some that didn't. That's my understanding of the science of that time.

Q.  Do you know what a scientific consensus is?

15       Q. Okay. Do you believe there was a

scientific consensus that smoking caused lung cancer in the '50s?

18        A.  My view is no.  There had not been a

consensus established at that point in time.

Q.  Do you believe there was a scientific

21 i  consensus that amoking caused lung cancer in the

A.  I don't know the exact decade.  I know that as we proceed from the '50s, '60s, '70s, '80s, '90s, 2000, 2010, there was a tremendous amount of data

that was developed, that there was more epidemiology.  There were more mechanistic studies. So I don't know the exact date that I would say there was a consensus.

I believe that over time more scientists probably held that belief and that especially in most recent decades there's been mechanisms

consensus.

A.  I do, yes.

which was 50 years ago; okay? And in the last 50 years we know that there's been about 20 million people who have died from smoking.  So that's the time period I want to talk about; okay?

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  So my question to you is in the '60s � I'm not asking you for a specific date or an exact date.  I'm actually narrowing it down to a decade, which is literally thousands of days.  So based upon your skill, experience and knowledge and

A.  In 1980, yes.

Q.  Okay.  Was there a scientific consensus at that point that smoking caused lung cancer?

A.  Again, I don't know that there would have been in my opinion.  I believe that from my perspective --

Q.  Okay.

A.  � the consensus really would have required, again, having more detailed information around mechanism, and that's been developed over the last 20 years or so.

A.  I think that there was still a range of views.  I wouldn't probably characterise it as a

Q.  Okay.  So then that would � so then you don't believe there was a consensus in the '60s, '70s or '80s that smoking caused lung cancer?

A. Again, as I indicated in my earlier answer, I don't know that I can pinpoint even a decade.  I think that there was a change over those decades,

science evolved.  There were more people that began to believe that it had been proven, that it was so. Prior to that time there may have been some that concluded it but even acknowledged there wasn't enough data to rely upon, but that was their opinion; but as far as a scientific consensus, I think in more recent years it clearly has existed. I don't know exactly when before that. MR. PAIGE:  Move to strike.

Q,  I just want to be clear, Doctor.  You already told me in 1980 when you went to work at Reynolds there was not a consensus.  Do you remember telling me that under oath?

A.  Yes.  I'm giving you my opinion.  To me it did not feel that way in terms of the science that was available.

Q.  Okay.  So if you don't � if you don't believe there was a consensus in 1980, we can agree that you don't believe there was a scientific consensus that smoking caused lung cancer in the 1960s or the 1970s; correct?

Q.  No.  I just want to ask you the questions I want to ask. And you told me there was no consensus in 1980.  Do you remember telling me that? At least you didn't believe there was a consensus in 1980. Do you remember saying that?

MR. LATHAM: Objact to the form. THE WITNESS: My answer, I believe, sir, and it's on the record, tried to give you an overall understanding that I don't know that I can pin down to a particular decade.  It will depend upon how you define consensus.  X Jtfcaok the key thing �

Q.  (By Mr. T*�g�^ Okay.  Let's do that. Let's do that. And I didn't know that was a confusion, so how � because I asked you earlier do you know what a scientific consensus is.  Do you remember? That's how we started.  Do you remember when I asked you that?

A. Yes.  You didn't ask me what I believed it was.  You asked me if I knew what it was.

Q. Right.  So I just assumed that we were talking about the same thing and maybe I was wrong. What do you believe a scientific consensus is?

A.  Scientific consensus is one where after review of various experiments, various appropriate

amounts of scientific research, that scientists on a broad basis come to a common conclusion.  So much like in a nonscientific setting, a consensus would be something that everyone basically agrees to from the standpoint of while it may not be their exact view, they acknowledge that it is an acceptable view.  That's reaching a consensus.  It's not everyone's first position, but it's one that they all collectively share.

And in terms of consensus in a scientific setting, consensus is driven by the amount of scientific data available and the amount of time that's been had to review all of that information and to probe it from various perspectives.  Science is largely based upon the concepts of the weight of evidence.  The larger the weight of evidence, the more likely that a true scientific consensus is arrived at.

Q.  Okay.  Fair enough.  So and you agree there is a scientific consensus today that smoking causes lung cancer?

A.  I believe so generally, yes.

Q.  Okay.  And you believe that the scientific consensus in 19 � I mean, in 2000 when R.J. Reynolds admitted it, you believe there was a

scientific consensus at that point that smoking caused lung cancer?

A.  I believe at that point in time, yea, there would have been throughout the decade before that a lot of information about mechanism.  It's been cited in the 2010 SGR, for example, and also following that in the 2000s.

Q.  Okay.  So I want to know, and you told me earlier you don't believe there was a scientific consensus in 1980 when you started at R.J. Reynolds. Do you remember telling me that?

A.  Yes. Again, in terms of scientists on a broad basis agreeing that there was a sufficient amount of science to have a definitive view, I think there were still some that wanted to see more science at that point in time to have more understanding of mechanism.

MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  Move to strike.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  My question to you is do you remember telling me that you did not believe there was a scientific consensus yet in 2000? You don't have to define consensus every question that you answer.  You've already defined it for me and I understand what you mean.

THE WITNESS:  I recall making comments as you tried to probe decade by decade and, yes, I think at that point in time there had not been a full consensus achieved.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  As far as a specific date, no.  I think that entire time period there was a lot of science conducted that drove overall scientific opinion, especially for scientists that wanted to see information around mechanism.

Q.  And you talked about that being a safer cigarette; correct?

A.  I don't recall those being my words in my answers to Mr. Latham's questions.

Q.  Well, do you think the Eclipse is a safer cigarette?

A.  My view is that we've conducted studies that clearly show that if someone switches from smoking combustible cigarettes to Eclipse for 24 weeks, that their exposure to carcinogens would be significantly reduced.  So I think that it's clearly a product that has the potential to reduce the risks associated with, for example, development of cancer.

Q.  So you do believe it's a safer cigarette? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I believe that it has the potential to reduce exposure and reduce risk.  If that's what you mean by safer, then yes.

decision whether they want to smoke the Eclipse

cigarette or not, they can rely upon the Surgeon G^n.^i. correct?

A.  Again, our guiding principle speaks for itself.  It would say to rely upon the conclusions of the Surgeon General when making decisions about smoking.  It doesn't suggest they should rely upon any particular part or not, in its entirety.

MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  The next exhibit is PT 3895.  And I have two of them, so we can just mark them.  One is just two pages and the other one is about five pages.  So we can mark the two-page one

THE COURT REPORTER:  Yes, air. MR. PAIGE:  So 38 and 39. (Plaintiff's Exhibit Numbers 38 and 39 were marked for identification.)

A.  I do.

Q.  And what is it?

A.  It begins with a copy of the front page of the 2010 Surgeon General's report.

Q.  And did you read the highlighted portions in there that talk about the Premier and Eclipse cigarette?

A.  The highlighted portions say in 1988 R.J. Reynolds launched a new era of novel products with pr#1|li#r^ ft nieotine delivering product similar in size and appearance to conventional cigarettes but consisting of an aluminum canister that contained aluminum beads impregnated with glycerin, propylene glycol and it ends the highlighting there.

15                           The next section further down that's

highlighted says compared with conventional cigarettes, Premier delivered similar doses of nicotine, higher levels of carbon monoxide and reduced levels of many toxicants.

The next highlighted section says more recently tobacco companies have developed several other novel cigarette-like products that deliver nicotine to the consumer.  Eclipse uses a technology

24   similar to that developed for Premier.  The heat

source is a carbon fuel element and nicotine and

Q.  And this is the type of information that you direct your consumers to review and rely upon;

A. Again, we have a guiding principle and belief about Surgeon General's reports if that's what you're referring to.

Q.  Including this report; correct?

A.  Yes.

Q. And what is that guiding principle and belief?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Again, Reynolds doesn't state any view about that particular paragraph.  We have a guiding principle and belief that includes Surgeon General's reports.  I can repeat that if you would like.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  Well, that's what I'm saying.  The guiding principle and belief of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is that the public should review and rely upon information like that that you just read?

A.  It indicates that smokers making decisions about smoking should rely upon the conclusions of the Surgeon General and a number of other bodies as well.

BY MR. LATHAM:

Q.  Are you okay, Or. Borgerding?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Dr. Borgerding, I want to follow up on three areas that Mr. Paige asked you about.  The first was the Philip Morris presentation by Dr. Wakeham, and I'll have to get you to tell me what exhibit number that was.  It was probably 30, around number 30.

Q.  Okay.  That last one you turned over, keep that one out, too, because I'm going to ask you about that one.

A.  okay.  I have Exhibit Number 29.

q  j� yOU>ii turn to page three of that exhibit?  Mr. Paige asked you to read number two, which said present technology does not permit

8 ! selective filtration of particulate smoke.  Does

general reduction via the use of filters filter particulate smoke?

A.  Yes.  That general reduction would be one technique to filter all of particulate smoke to

13   reduce it

Q.  Based on your expertise in cigarette smoke chemistry and cigarette design, what is this referring to, selective filtration of particulate smoke?

A.  That would indicate that the mechanism I described in an earlier answer that focuses on very specific compounds was not available to filter particulate smoke.  That being said, in this general time frame there was the introduction prior to this

23   actually of filters and filters containing something

called plasticizers.  And those materials did provide selected filtration of some compounds in

particulate smoke, but generally the approach for filtering particulate smoke would be a general reduction technology.

Q.  If you turn to page two of that exhibit, there's a partial list of compounds identified in cigarette smoke*  Do you see that list?

A.  I do.

Q.  I'm not going to mark it as an exhibit just to save space, but I'm going to hand you a copy of the 1964 Surgeon General's report. And I want you to look at it and tell me whether or not the '64 report contains a chapter on cigarette smoke chemistry that would have reported on many of the compounds on this list,

A.  Yes.  This is the 1964 Surgeon General's report, and chapter six summarises knowledge about the chemical composition of cigarette smoke and it would include these types of compounds, a wide range of compounds in terms of class, and would also speak specifically to, for example, carcinogenic hydrocarbons and heterocyclics in tobacco smoke, which would include compounds on the list.

19         A.  In general I believe based upon the

20   statements made and upon the agreement that was

21   entered into, it was the expectation that the funds

22   that were being paid each year would be used to

23   raise awareness about the risks of cigarette smoking

24   through public education and through ongoing

out, and it cites 2000, and the 20X0 Surgeon General

2   that's writing about Eclipse?

3         A.  Yes.  There were scientific studies

4   conducted and published in the peer reviewed

5   literature during that time frame that are not part

6   of this report.

7         Q.  And so the Surgeon General in 2010 didn't

8   cite other peer reviewed scientific literature that

9   Reynolds had conducted and published on Eclipse? 10 !       A.  That's correct.

Q.  Based on your understanding of Eclipse cigarette smoke chemistry and the machine method testing that was used by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, do you agree with the findings that the yields of Eclipse are similar to or higher than commercial cigarettes in the marketplace?

A.  No.  I don't.

Q.  Will you explain why you don't?

12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19

20 �      A,  Yes.  First of all, in terms of the Labstat

21 22

24 25

2000 study that's cited to here by Massachusetts, it was quite puzzling in that Massachusetts requires a smoking machine regimen that includes what's called vent blocking.  So especially very low yielding cigarettes have something called filter ventilation.

And studies have shown that smokers block some of the vents at least some of the time with fingers or lips.  So based upon those findings, Massachusetts requires for a ventilated cigarette and for that matter for all cigarettes that they be tested with 50 percent vent blocking in the machine testing regimen.

Despite that ongoing annual requirement by the Commonwealth since 1997, in the year 2000, the report that's being cited to, they used instead what was then known as the FTC or ISO regimen that had no filter ventilation.  And so it was not an appropriate condition to compare the products, number one.

When we'd look at actual exposures in clinical studies that are not cited because they had not been � well, they weren't cited in this Surgeon General's report, we see clear reductions.

And in studies in which we used a range of machine regimens including those used in the lab /STET report and the Massachusetts regimen and something referred to as the Health Canada Intense Regimen and compared the biological activity of Eclipse cigarette smoke to the same cigarette types that were used in this 2000 report, we see that the

method of doing so was through claims of low deliveries of tar.  For example, in 1977 British American Tobacco marketing report concluded all work in this area should be directed towards providing consumer reassurance, emphasis in original, about 6 i  cigarettes and their smoking habit.

This can be provided in different ways, for example, by claiming low deliveries, by the perception of low deliveries and by the perception of mildness.  At the same time tobacco company documents also clearly demonstrate that the industry understood that smokers would not achieve the claimed deliveries because of smoker compensation.

For example, a 1975 Philip Morris memo noted in effect the Marlboro 85 smokers in this study did not achieve any reduction in smoke intake by smoking a cigarette, Marlboro Lights, normally considered lower in delivery, end quotes.

In contrast to industry awareness, the various ways that cigarettes were physically modified and the nature and level of compensation in response to design changes were not well understood by parties outside of the tobacco industry itself. Public health officials had little basis to anticipate the degree to which manufacturers could

Xt was not until the turn of the 21st century that it became increasingly clear that no relationship existed between machine-measured tar and nicotine levels and tha risk for most categories of cigarette-related diseases.

Q.  And Doctor, do you know what they're talking about when they're talking about the importance of health reassurance messages?

A.  Other than what it states here, that's my understanding of what they're saying.  I've just read their view of it.

Q.  Well, they're talking about -- aren't they talking about when the tobacco companies would market light cigarettes as being safer or filters as being safer, that those are the type of health reassurance messages that they're referring to? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  They indicate a number of different things here.  They state what they mean, I believe, by consumer reassurance and they cite various areas.  Some of those areas are in terms of

q   (By i^ pa�gA)  what doas that mean? Which is what?

A.  A yiald of a cigarette is something that's established by requirement of the Federal Trade Commission, that is, under very specified machine conditions yields are determined by a method that the Federal Trade Commission stated in 1967 is not intandad to tell you what any ona smoker would gat nor to tall you how someone smokes.  So they're intended to be a basis to compare cigarettes under standardized conditions.

Q.  Where the government is indicating in contrast to the industry awareness, the various ways that cigarettes were physically modified and the nature and level of compensation in response to design changes were not well understood by parties outside the tobacco industry itself, do you know what they're referring to there?

A. No. My view is that, again, the Fadaral Trade Commission in 1967 was quite clear in the Federal Register about both what the method was intended to do and what it was not intended to do. This paragraph as I read it tends to suggest that no

4   what they're referring to there, Dr. Borgerding? A.  Again, I've given you my understanding.

Let me be more specific. My understanding is this

method for testing was intended to do something that the Federal Trade Commission said from day one it was not intended to do.

Q.  So the Surgeon General is wrong?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I'm giving you my understanding of the facts in terms of the Federal Trade Commission.  I don't understand why the statement would be made in this regard.  It seems to be disregarding what was put forward in 1967 at the very beginning of the testing requirement by the federal government about the test method.

20         Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  Did the tobacco industry

21   and R.J. Reynolds have anything to do with misleading the government?

A.  My understanding is that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company provided information to the Federal Trade Commission and, in fact, they indicated to the

Federal Trade Commission that no single test method could tell you the ways in which people smoke or the many ways that � the many yields that might result based upon variable behaviors across individuals and across time and that that in my reading is quite clearly reflected by the Federal Trade Commission as what the method is not intended to do.

Q.  Doctor, really, I'm having a hard time understanding your answer.  I just want to know do you believe that long paragraph you read from the 2010 Surgeon General, do you believe that is incorrect or a correct statement of fact?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I believe I've answered that already.  It's not consistent with what the Federal Trade Commission has indicated the purpose is.  So it either is ignoring what the Federal Trade Commission has said or there's something that I don't understand when I read it.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  You don't understand it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I believe that it's quite clear that this is making a statement about the purpose of the Federal Trade Commission testing method that the Federal Trade Commission indicated

17   important method of them doing that was through

18   claims of low tar delivery, deliveries of � I'm

19   sorry.  Let me restate it.  Then the Surgeon General

20 21 22 23 24

goes on to state one important method of doing that was through claims of low deliveries of tar.  Do you agree with the Surgeon General in that regard, do you disagree or do you not know?

purpose around the test method together with the fact that testing was required under those conditions and the values to be included in advertising, I don't agree that that was the intention.

The federal government decided upon the test method.  The federal government mandated the test method.  The federal government indicated what the test method was intended to do and what it was not intended to do and required that values be part of advertising.

Q.  Then it goes on to say a 1977 British American Tobacco marketing report.  Do you see that?

A.  I see where it's speaking about something that's not part of the United States, yes.

Q.  Right.  The British American Tobacco Company is the largest shareholder of Reynolds, of R.J. Reynolds; correct?

A.  They are currently.  They were not at that time �

Q.  So it says the 1977 British American Tobacco marketing report concluded all work in this area should be directed towards providing consumer reassurance about cigarettes and the smoking habit. This can be provided in different ways, e.g., by

A.  I believe you generally did, yes.

Q.  Then it goes on to say at the sane time, again, 1977, that's after the '67 FTC report; correct^

A.  Yes.  It's in 1977.  It's referring to something that's not in this country or part of our company.

Q.  And than it says at the same time tobacco company documents also clearly demonstrate that the industry understood that smokers would not achieve the claimed deliveries because of smoker compensation.  Do you agree with that statement, disagree or do you not have an opinion?

A.  I don't agree with that statement.  I believe that the key is that the Federal Trade Commission indicated from the time the method was implemented that it was not intended to tell you what a smoker would receive that is yield from the cigarette when they smoked it.  They acknowledged that there's �

Q.  But they were wrong?  The FTC was wrong?

A.  No.  The FTC was correct in that regard.

1   The FTC indicated what the method was intended to do

2   and what the method was not intended to do.  They

3   stated clearly that the method was not intended to

4   tell you what a cigarette smoker would yield out of

5   a cigarette.

6            And they gave the basis for that being

7   that there's no single machine regimen that can tell

8   you before the fact what a person's behavior would

9   be, that the yield will depend upon their smoking

10   behavior. And so the method was intended �

11         Q.  Okay.

12         A.  If I may finish, the method was intended to

not what you said, then let me � did the federal government know that low tar cigarettes were no safer than regular cigarettes?

MR. LATHAM:  Object to the form.

THE WITNESS:  In terms of the federal government, I think that they have put forward

7   information in various Surgeon General reports about

8   their views and about the science that they

9   collected and reviewed.  They've made a number of

10   statements about cigarettes over time. And in terms

11   of their views of that, I think that they evolved as

12   there was more information about exposure.

13         Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  When is the first time that

14   R.J. Reynolds told the public that � strike that.

15   Do you know what percentage of the smoking

16   population smokes filtered cigarettes?

17         A.  Today?

18         Q.  Yeah.

19         A.  Today most cigarettes sold would be

20   filtered cigarettes.  There would be just a small

21   percentage that would be nonfiltered cigarettes.

22         Q.  And about 400,000 people a year are dying

23   from smoking diseases today; correct?

24         A.  We've had the discussions before in terms

literature you're referring to.  There would be figures like that put forward by the CDC, others from the federal government, and the peer reviewed literature would use a bit lower figures than that.

Q.  The figures are between 380 and 440,000 a year; correct?

A.  I believe that those are figures that we would typically see today, yes.  And again, I would �

Q.  Around 400?

A.  I would qualify that those figures are based upon data from ten years ago.

Q.  Do you claim that light cigarettes are safe?

A.  There's no such thing as a safe tobacco product, meaning a tobacco product that's devoid of all risk.  So light cigarettes would not be devoid of all risk.  It's not safe.

Q.  Do you believe light cigarettes cause lung cancer?

Q,  Do you believe filtered cigarettes cause lung cancer?

A. I believe that all cigarettes including filtered cigarettes can cause lung cancer in some individuals.

Q.  Do you believe filtered cigarettes are safer than nonfiltered cigarettes?

A.  I believe that there's a difference in risk for a filtered cigarette versus a nonfiltered cigarette that, for example, the measurement of yields would show that filtered cigarettes are lower in yields of smoke than nonfiltered cigarettes and that epidemiology would show the risk for smoking related diseases is less for filtered cioarettes than for nonfiltered cigarettes.

Q.  So you think a filtered cigarette is safer than a nonfiltered cigarette?

A.  If by safer you mean there's less risk,

There's literature available that would show the differences in risk, but there are significant difference in risk for smoking-related diseases between nonfiltered cigarettes and filtered cigarettes.

Q.  But don't people who smoke filtered cigarettes smoke more cigarettes?

A.  No.  People that smoke filtered cigarettes today smoke far fewer than in the past.  We've had that discussion earlier, but the incidence and the number of cigarettes smoked per day has declined consistently over a number of years now.

Q.  And then what about light cigarettes? Do you think they're safer than nonfilters? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Again, in terms of lower yielding products, those products would have less risk for smoking-related diseases than nonfiltered cigarettes and for some very low yield cigarettes it's clear that exposure to cancer causing compounds would be less.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  Have you heard that some people who are smoking filters and light cigarettes are getting adenocarcinoma more than nonfiltered smokers? Have you heard that?

A.  I've read some literature in that regard around that theory, yes.

Q.  Do you believe that?

A.  I believe that there's been research in that area.  I haven't personally reached a conclusion.  I believe that clearly there's been a general focus on reducing a number of compounds in cigarette smoke over time, and one class of compounds that's been significantly reduced is in the area of nitrosamines,

11 !                        These are compounds that have been

reported in literature around the question that you've asked.  And so I know there have been significant efforts for all cigarettes in the United

15  States to reduce those compounds.

Q. Again, I don't understand your answer to my question. Do you think people who smoke filters are more likely to get adenocarcinoma than people who smoke nonfilters?

9   light cigarettes are more susceptible to

10   adenocarcinoma.  You're aware of that research now?

11         A.  I'm aware of that theory.  My point,

12   though, is that what is being put forward there is

13   not based upon the cigarettes of today.

14         Q.  But you're making the cigarettes.  Don't

reduced these compounds in tobacco smoke.  So yes, I think it is important to be aware of the scientific literature, to consider the strength of the science and to try and interpret that science in a way that can reduce risk.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  Okay.  And what is the compound again that you're referring to?

A.  The compounds that I'm referring to are tobacco-specific nitrosamines.

Q.  Okay.  So you're aware of peer reviewed literature that does state that people who smoke filters are more susceptible to getting adenocarcinoma than nonfiltered smokers? You're at least aware of that peer reviewed literature? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  You're mischaracterizing my testimony.  I'm aware that that theory has been put forward that there was �

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  That's not what I'm asking. Have you read any peer reviewed literature that is published that you've read that has found that smoking filtered cigarettes would make somebody more susceptible to developing adenocarcinoma of the lung than a nonfiltered smoker?

A.  I don't believe that I've read literature

that draws that as a final conclusion.  I've read litaratura that suggests it's a possibility.  I've raad litaratura that would also suggest the basis by which it's a possibility, and I've raad litaratura that shows tha actual changas to curing of tobacco to try and reduce those compounds.

Q. Okay. And would the same answer be true about light cigarettes so I don't have to reask it again?

A.  I believe the answer is yes.

Q.  Okay.  And so the theory is that many smokers are --or more smokers are getting adenocarcinoma who are smoking filters and light smokers because of certain chamical compounds in the cigarettes?

A,  One of the theories put forward is that there is a shift in the type of cancer. And in addition to that, the foundation or the underlying mechanism of that, there have been views put forward that that may be related to specific compounds in

And in response to that, there's been a large scale effort to change the way in which tobacco is cured to reduce those compounds in tobacco substantially by 80, 90 percent or more and

MR. PAIGE:  I thought that �

THE WITNESS:  You asked me about those compounds , about that particular theory and then about my response in terms of what I had read and the underlying mechanism.  It applies to all cigarettes.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  It's nothing to do with the filter or the light cigarette.  It has nothing to do with the inhalation of the cigarette?

A.  Yes.  I'm sorry, Mr. Paige.  We can start again.  It has everything to do with the question you asked me. And you asked me have I read any literature that would suggest that there is a change in incidence of adenocarcinoma.  I indicated to you that I've read literature �

Q.  No, no, no.  And that's not � that wasn't my question.  If it was, I apologise.  I was asking you if you read anything in the literature that suggests the smoker of a filtered cigarette would be

1   more susceptible to adenocarcinoma than a

2   nonfiltared smoker?

3         A.  I've read theories that suggest that if

4   people change their smoking behavior, that they may

5   be at risk for different types of cancer. And in

rospunov   uu   winw   x   ve   1150   ivad  as   parw   OE   vXiaw  a

9   read that there's been active efforts to greatly

10 i    reduce those compounds.

11         Q.  Okay.  Do the compounds have anything to do

12   with the filter?

13         A.  Yes, very much so.

14         Q.  Okay.  Can you explain that to me?

again �

q.  (By Mr. Paiga) What is the theory? That's what I want to know.  What is the theory?  Is it just because there's this chemical? You're saying two different things or at least I'm hearing two different things.  So why is it that it's � that there are some who believe that a smoker of filtered cigarettes is more susceptible to adenocarcinoma of the lung than a nonfiltered smoker?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Again, the theory is that it's exposure to those particular compounds that may well be the driver.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  So those compounds are only in filtered cigarettes?

A.  No, but, again, it's the question of would there be an increased exposure to them depending upon smoking behavior.  And again, the key is that � been reduced.

Q.  Let me stop you.  Stop for a second.  Okay. But why is there an increase in exposure to those compounds if you smoke a filtered cigarette as opposed to a nonfiltered cigarette?

A.  Again, that's --

Q.     That's what I don't understand.

A.  Again, that's just a theory.  They --

Q.  What is the theory?

A.  The theory is that the exposure would be

5         Q.  Why?

6         A.  � explain based --

7         Q.  Why?

8         A.  Why is their exposure increased?

9         Q.  Yes.

10         A.  Because they draw more smoke.

11         Q.  Okay.  But if they have a filter, why are

12   they drawing more smoke?

11                         A    Ann 4 n  hnrimo � ��

15             THE WITNESS:  � smoking behavior depends

16   entirely upon how a smoker smokes any cigarette.  A

17   smoker that smokes more puffs on a given cigarette

18   will be exposed to more smoke.

19             So it's entirely driven by individual

20   smoking behavior, but the key is based upon the

21   mechanism put forward that if these particular

22   compounds are reduced significantly in tobacco, it

23   doesn't matter what behavior is exhibited.  Their

5            MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

6            THE WITNESS:  Sir, you're nixing things

7   together here.  In terms of exposure to nitrosamines

8   it's quite clear, there have been publications in

9   this regard, that exposure has been reduced based

10   upon a change in the curing practice of tobacco.

11         Q-  (By Mr. Paige)  Okay.  But that -- how

12   many ~� nitrosamine, is that one of the carcinogens

13   in cigarette smoke?

14         A.  More than one, but yes.

15         Q. Okay.  How many?

16         A. At least two of the tobacco-specific

17   nitrosamines would be classified as known human

18   carcinogens.

19         Q. Okay. But there's still 70 or 80 more that

20   are left?

21 22 23 24

A.  Mot of nitrosamines.

Q.  Of carcinogens?

A.  Yes, but, again, you're asking about the theories around a particular type of cancer, and the theories around that cancer have focused upon those

compounds, not the other compounds.

Q.  So as I understand it, the theory as it's been published in the peer reviewed literature is somebody who smokes a filtered cigarette or a light cigarette is going to be exposed to more nitrosamines because their compensation is greater than a nonfiltered smoker and because of that there has been an increased reporting of adenocarcinoma in those s�0kers; is that corr.ct?

A. That's one type of theory. Another theory doesn't have to do with anything around behavior but just changes in tobacco over time.

Q.  Okay.  And whether it's changing in behavior or changes in tobacco over time, you understand that whether it's 380,000 or 440,000 Americana who are dying every year, that's a lot of people?

A.  Yes.  Those are numbers that we would like to see significantly reduced.  We don't want anyone in that regard.  We would like to see risk greatly reduced or eliminated if that's possible.

Q.     And you haven't been able to -- the number � well, strike that.  The number has been around 400,000 for some time now?

the best thing for them to do is to quit smoking, yes.

1   others may stop without any help whatsoever just

2   because they choose to.  In fact, my understanding

3   is most people that quit smoking do it by that

4   method.  They pick a date, they decide to quit and

5   they do.

6         Q.  Okay.  I don't want to get into a whole

7   debate over how many were addicted, how many

8   weren't.  My only question to you is you understand

9   that some addicted smokers take many attempts before

10   they're successful in quitting. Do you know that?

11         A.  Yes. My understanding is for some it can

12   be quite difficult and they require multiple

Q. Okay.  I'm saying some of the people who've died, R.J. Reynolds knows that some of those people really did try to quit?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection. THE WITNESS: Again, my understanding is that many people have considered quitting.  Most of those have quit just by choosing a date and deciding to quit.  For others, it can be more difficult.  In that regard one thing that can help a smoker quit is nicotine replacement therapy and that's a product that is something that R.J. Reynolds' scientists have worked with in the form of Zonnic gum, for example.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  Okay.  Again, my question � move to strike.  That's not really responsive. I'm just asking if you know this, you know.  If you don't, you don't know.

for soma individuals.

Q.  Okay. We talked about how some people it's more difficult to quit than others.  Remember, we talked about that? You talked about how some people ^j^ multiple attempts to quit; right?

A.  Many do, yes, and then they're successful.

Q.  And then you also told me that many people, there are still other smokers who end up dying from a smoking-related disease.  Do you remember telling me that?

A.  There are people that do die from smoking-related disease, yes.

Q. And as a scientist who's concerned for the welfare and health of people, do you know that many

unsuccessfully before they died? Do you know that or do you not know that?

A.  I don't know the statistics in that regard. What I know is that tens of millions of people have quit smoking and the vast majority of those my understanding have quit without any intervention, without nicotine replacement therapy, just by making a decision to quit and picking a quit date.

Q.  Okay.  Move to strike.  I promise I'll talk to you about the tens of millions who have quit if

1    that's what you want to talk about.  W�'ll do that

2    in a moment, but ny question to you, I'm not asking

3    for the exact number.  My question to you is do you

4    know or do you not know that of the paople who do i

5    die from smoking-reiated diseases, that sone of then

6    have tried very hard to quit and have been

7    unsuccessful? Did you know that or no?

8           A.  I don't know about every individual.  I've

9    given you my best understanding of the fact that

10    many smokers have tried to quit and many of those

11    are successful.  Others require repeated attempts

12    and then they're successful.  Some individuals

13    choose to keep smoking.

i

14           Q.  Okay.  Again, I'll reask it.  I'll move to

15    strike.  I'm not asking about every individual.  If

16    you thought I was, I apologize.  Of the 400 �

17    approximate 400,000 people who die every year from

18    smoking, do you know whether some of those people

19    tried to quit but were unsuccessful and unable to do

20    so? Do you know that or do you not know that?

21           A.  I don't know about individuals in that way.

22           Q.  Do you know about statistics in general

23    that of the peopla who die, that some of them have

24    tried to quit but were unsuccessful?

25           A.  I haven't read to my knowledge statistics

in that regard, no.

Q.  Rave you ever heard of that, that some people who died from smoking tried to quit but were unsuccessful?  Have you ever heard of that?

A.  Again, my understanding is that tens of millions of people have quit and for some �

Q.  No.  Have you ever heard of that?  I know people have quit.  I'm asking about the ones who haven't quit but died.  Have you ever heard that some of those people tried to quit?  Have you ever heard that or no?

A.  Again, I would assume that in terms of all the smokers, all that have smoked cigarettes, some may have made a quit attempt and then continued to smoke.  Some have chosen to quit and have quit.  As far as some smoking all the way until the end of their lifetime, I think some smokers do.

Q.  All right.  It's kind of � you're almost answering my question but not really.  My question to you is have you heard that some of the people who died, that some of those people had tried to quit but were unable to? Have you ever heard that?

A.  I don't believe that I've heard that in that way.  What I have heard, I've told you, and what I've read, I've told you in a number of answers

now.

Q.  So that as a scientist at R.J. Reynolds it would surprise you to learn that sone of the 400,000 people who die every year, that some of those people tried to quit but were unable to do so? That type of situation would surprise you to learn that?

A.  I don't believe that I would characterise it in that way.  I think that if you're asking mo about statistics around tobacco use and throughout the lifetime, I would need to go and refresh on that and read about it.  I think that in terms of smokers, there are many different mechanisms to help people quit.

Clearly for those that would like to quit, it can be difficult for some, not as difficult for others, and tens of millions of people have quit smoking.

Q.  Of the tens of millions of people who quit smoking, do you know how many of them were addicted?

A.  I believe in our earlier discussions in the first part of the deposition I made reference and we

in the scientific literature.  That article would speak to the concept of dependence and would suggest that in the U.S. about 50 percent of smokers at

MR. PAIGE:  Well, I've got a phone call at 4:30.  I've got to make it.

MR. LATHAM:  I mean, how many more questions do you have?

MR. PAIGE:  I mean, I really didn't have any.  I just can't get him to answer a question directly, and I want this on the record.  So I should be able to be done in five minutes but, you know, I'm not going to �

MR. LATHAM:  All right.  We'll take --

you're answering questions about prior testimony that it doesn't work like that.  The prior answers may get stricken.  They may not get played.  So I'm asking you directly and you can just tell me this. MR. LATHAM:  All right.  Try it one more time.

MR. pAJGE:  If you can, I'll try it one more time.  If not, we're going to take a break. MR. LATHAM:  Okay.

g.  (By Mr. Paige)  Of the tens of millions of people who have quit smoking, do you know how many were addicted and how many were not?

A.  I don't know that exact figure, no.

Q.  Of the tens of millions of people who quit smoking, do you know how many of them relapsed and started smoking again?

A.  I don't know that exact figure, no.

Q.  Of the tens of millions of people who've quit smoking, do you know how many of them smoked a few cigarettes a day or a few cigarettes a week as opposed to a pack a day or two packs a day?

A.  I don't know that exact figure, but it's my general understanding that the large majority of them would have been probably pack-a-day smokers or perhaps more.

Q.  Where did you learn that?

A.  just based upon the general smoking rates over the years.

Q.  Well, didn't you ever learn that the study is actually based upon anybody who smoked 100 cigarettes or more in their entire lifetime and they quit was considered a quitter?  Have you learned that?

A.  There have been quite a range of studies that have been conducted in terms of the tens of millions of smokers that have quit smoking.  It's not my understanding that a large percentage of those would have been smokers that only smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime.

Q.     Well, tell me the scientific basis that you're -- where did you learn specifically � you know, I do need to take a break because this is going to take a while because I've really talked to a lot of people on this topic and this is the first time I've ever heard that the majority of these people who quit were a pack a day or two pack a day smokers.  So let's take a break and then we'll just come back in like fifteen minutes or so.

MR. LATHAM:  Okay.  All right.  Take a break.

THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  This marks the beginning of volume two, media file number six in the deposition of Michael Borgerding.  The time is 5:05 and we're back on the record.

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  All right.  Dr. Borgerding, I want to go over the number of Americans who have quit smoking in our country; okay?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you had indicated the number was � it's some tens of millions of Americans who have quit smoking; correct?

A.  Yes. My understanding is there are more former smokers than current smokers and that tens of millions of smokers have quit.

q.  So we know that there's about 40 million current smokers, so I think the literature � not the literature.  The studies show it's about 50 million smokers have quit; right?

A.  I believe that's a reasonable general

Q. And it's bean reported that since 1964 about 20 million smokers have died; correct?

4         A.  I believe I've seen figures in that regard,

5   yea.

6         Q. And currently there's about 8.5 million

i

7 I    Americans living with a smoking-related disease?

13         A.  I would need to review that literature.  I

14   don't have that number in mind.

15         Q.  No problem.  But in any event, of the 50

16   million smokers who have quit, I just want to know

17   where did you get that number from?  Is it something

18   a lawyer told you? Is it something that you heard

20   where you heard it, I want to know where you heard

Q.  okay.  But was it an exhibit that I gave you or an exhibit that your lawyer gave you?

A.  In terms of today, it was an exhibit that Mr. Latham showed me.

to him or that he provided to you?

A.  it's something that he brought today, but it's something that I've seen before.  It's on a website.

Q.  when you first saw it � but I'm saying when you first saw it, was it something that you came up with or was it something that the lawyers gave you?

A.  Yes.  That's my recollection.  I haven't �� unless you'd like me to, I don't have the exhibit in

6   front of me.

Q.  I'm looking at it.  So in any event, so there's 43 million current smokers. We know there's roughly, you know, more than that that have quit. What I want to ask you is how far back does that go in time? Where does that number � well, strike

came up with that number?

A.  This is a number that's put forward by the CDC.  It's been put forward by others in the government as well as best I know.

17         Q.  Okay. Now, do you know how the CDC came up

18   with that number, what method they used to come up

19   with that number?

20         A.  I believe that they've looked at the data

21   as far as the incidence of smokers over time and

22   they've looked at how that's declined and how many

23   people have quit smoking and have made those

Q. Do you know if it's based upon polling data that asks people have you quit smoking and to be included within the poll you had to have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?

1 I                         THE WITNESS:  Again, as far as the j

2   underlying data, I would need to go and review all

3   of that.  I believe what you're referring to is it's

4   very common in studies, very common even in clinical

i

5   studies if you're trying to determine if someone is

6   a smoker, that one criteria that's used from a

cigarettes or more.

That being said, that generally is not the only criteria in studies.  Generally the question would be have you been a regular cigarette smoker for X period of time, how long have you smoked and so on.  So there's more to it than the simple criteria of a first level entry definition of a minimum of 100 cigarettes in a lifetime.  What that does is --

Q.  (By Mr. Paige)  When they say --

18       A. What that does is �

Q.  When they say � go ahead.  I'm sorry.

A.  I'm sorry.  What that general inclusion criteria in a particular study would do is, first of all, make sure that individuals that may have tried one cigarette or some small number of cigarettes are never considered to be regular cigarette smokers.

Q.  Right.  So in the inclusion in the data

that says that more -- there's more former smokers than current smokers, meaning the data indicates that roughly- 50 million or �0 million Americans have quit, do you know if that data includes anybody who smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime?

A.  Again, I need to review the underlying studies.  I would expect that in a study of that nature that that would be one question that would be asked but not the only question that would be asked to categorize and characterize smoking history.

Q.  Okay.  Well, Doctor, this is a deposition where you need to � we need to know not what you suspect but what you know; okay?

CHARACTERIZATION OF THE TOBACCO HABIT

Nicotine

Of the known chemical substances present in tobacco and tobacco smoke, only nicotine has been given aerioui pharmacological consideration in rela-tionahip to the tobacco habit Lewin (17) stated. "The decisive factor in the effects of tobacco, desired or undesired, m nicotine ... and it matter* little whether it paaaea directly into the organism or it smoked." Support for this statement is baaed mostly on rationalizations from smoking behavior, analogy to other habits involving pharmacological agents and, to a much leaser eitent, on established scientific fact. The latter may be summarized briefly as follows:

1.  Only plants with active pharmacological principles have been employed habitually by large populations over long periods; e.g., tobacco (nicotine); coffee, tee, and cocoa (caffeine); betel nut morsel (arecoline); marihuana (cannibinok); that (psetfdoephedrine); opium imorphinel; coca leaves (cocaine); and others (see Lewin, 17).

2.  Dentcotinixed tobacco has not found general public acceptance as a substitute {16, pp. 531-532).

3.  Qiewing tobacco and using snuff, although providing oral gratification, also furnish nicotine for absorption to produce systemic effects (34) -

4.  Many but not afl smokers can detect a reduction in nicotine content of cigarettes (9).

5.  The administration of nicotine mimics the subjective effects of smoking {13). In uncontrolled experiments Johnston administered nicotine hyp<>oVmieaUy, intravenously, or orally to smokers and non-smokers. Non-smokers found the effects "queer," whereas many smokers, including Johnston himseM, claimed the subjective effects to be identical to those obtained by inhaling cigarette smoke and found that the urge to smoke was greatly reduced during nicotine administration.

In spite of the anecdotal nature of most of this information, the facts are that nicotine is present in tobacco in significant amounts, is absorbed readily from all routes of administration, and exerts detectable pharmacological effects on many organs and structures including the nervous system.   The

classical pharmacological characterization of nicotine��Uukr stimulation followed by depression whkh is noted in isolated tissue and organ system*� baa been invoked to explain the widely differing subjective responses of smokers, many of whom describe the effects as stimulating ("smoking relieves the depression of the spirits"), while others obtain a soothing and tranquiliz-ing effect (16, p. 533).

Wader (33) mmmartsed the literature by noting **. . . observations that cigarette smoking obviously serves a dual purpose: it will mostly pick us up

349
pgNbr=383
when we tie tired or depressed and will relax and sedate us when we arr tense and excited." In order to ascribe such biphaaic effects solely to the direct action of nicotine it would be necessary to discount psychological responses and alterations in mood from all other types of stimuli associated with smoking or the use of tobacco, an obvious impossibility. Although Knapp and Domino (151 have shown nicotine in small amounts to exert potent arousal effects in the electroencephalogram in animals, this evidence is difficult to interpret as it relates to smoking in man. A consensus among modern authors (27) appears to be that smoking, and presumably nicotine, exert a predominantly tranquiluing and relaxing effect The act of smoking is of such complexity that the difficulties associated with objective analysis of whether smoking induces pleasure by creating euphoria or by relieving dysphoria renders objective analysis virtually impossible. The anecdotal literature suggests that sedation plays a more important subjective role in pipe and cigar smoking than with cigarette smoking. Since most pipe and cigar smokers do not inhale, this suggests that bronchial and pulmonary irritation from cigarette smoke after inhaling may contribute an important sensory input to the central nervous system which could modify the sedative effects of nicotine, so that some individuals would describe the experience as stimulating rather than sedative. Heavy cigarette smokers who inhale often describe the act as a pleasant sensory experience which constitutes for them one of the prime drives to continue to smoke. Freedman (10) used the term "pulmonary erotism" Mulhall (19) and Robksek (22) have commented on this concept. An interesting psychoanalytical approach by Jonas (141, which postulates central nervous system counterirritation to constant pulmonary irritation from smoking, is based upon this concept If pulmonary irritation is a pleasure factor il probably is not related to nicotine alone but to other irritants in smoke and could represent a non-specific increase in afferent sensory discharge from the whole respiratory tract. A gap in knowledge exists in this area. Furthermore, until carefully controlled experiments with nicotine are conducted in man, the literature will be burdened further with anecdote and hypothesis rather than fact.

Distinction Between Drug Addiction and Dhug Habituation

Smokers and users of tobacco in other forms usually develop some degree of dependence upon the practice, some to the point where significant emotional disturbances occur if they are deprived of its use. The evidence indicates this dependence to be psychogenic in origin. In medical and scientific terminology the practice should be labeled habituation to distinguish it clearly from addiction, since the biological effects of tobacco, like coffee and other caffeine-containing beverages, betel morsel chewing and the like, are not comparable to those produced by morphine, alcohol, barbiturates, and many other potent addicting drugs- In fact, to make this distinction, the World Health Organization Expert Committee on Drugs Liable to Produce Addiction (35) created the following definitions which are accepted throughout the world as the basis for control of potentially dangerous drugs.

vidnal and on society.                           marily on the individual.

Tobacco Habit Characterized as Habituation

Psychogenic dependence is the common denominator of all drug habits and the primary drive whkh kada to initiation and relapse to chronic drug use or abuse (25). Although a pharmacologic drive is necessary it does not need to be a strong one or to produce profound subjective effects in order that habituation to the use of the crude material becomes a pattern of life. Besides tobacco, the use of caffeine in coffee, tea, and cocoa is the beat example in the American culture. Another example, the chewing of the betel morsel, exist* on a world scale comparable to tobacco and involves several hundred million individuals of both sexes and of all races, classes, and religions (17). Tile morsel contains arecoline from the areca nut, an ingredient of the mixture. It is a very mild stimulant of the nervous system which it ordinarily no more detectable than nicotine subjectively. The morse) is chewed from morning to night, from infancy lo death, and creates a craving more powerful' than that for tobacco. As with tobacco, oral gratification plays an important role in this habit.

Thus, correctly designating the chronic use of tobacco as habituation rather than addiction carries with it no implication that the habit may be broken easily. Tt does, however, carry an implication concerning the basic nature of the naer and this distinction ahould be a dear one. It is generally accepted among psychiatrists that addiction to potent drugs is baaed upon serious personality defects from underlying psychologic or psychiatric disorders which may become manifest in other ways if the drugs are removed '32).

Even the most energetic and emotional campaigner against smokin* and nicotine could find little support for the view that aQ those who use tobacco,

1W-M2 O-W-W

3S1
pgNbr=385
coffee, tea, and cocoa are in need of mental care even though it may tt some time in the future be shown that smokers and nan-smokers have different psychologic characteristics.

Relationship of Smoking to Use of Addicting Drugs

Undoubtedly, the smoking habit becomes compulsive in some heavy smokers but the drive to compulsion appears to be solely psychogenic iSnce physical dependence docs not develop to nicotine or to other constituents of tobacco nor does tobacco, either during its use or following withdrawal, create psychotoxic effects which lead to antisocial behavior. Compu)$jon exists in many grades, from the habit pattern of the cigarette smoker who subconsciously reaches into his pocket for a cigarette and may even ligrht hi* lighter before he realizes that he is already holding a lighted cigarette m hi* lips, to the heroin addict who becomes involved in crime, sometime* jM murder, in his search for drugs to satisfy his addiction. Clearly there � a significant difference, not only in the personality involved but also in the effects upon the user and his relationship to society.

Proof of physical dependence require* demonstration of a characteristic and reproducible abstinence syndrome upon withdrawal of a drug or chemical which occurs spontaneously, inevitably, and is not under control of the subject. Neither nicotine nor tobacco comply with any of these requirements (26). In fact, many heavy smokers may cease abruptly and, while retaining the desire to smoke, experience no significant symptoms or signs on withdrawal. On the other hand, it is well established that many symptoms and a few signs which may be observed objectively by others may occur following cessation of smoking, but no characteristic abstinence syndrome occurs (16, p. 5391- Rather, a gamut of mild symptoms and signs is experienced and observed as in any emotional disturbance secondary to deprivation of a desired object or habitual experience. These may be manifest in some persons as an increased nervous excitability, such as restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, tremor, palpitation, and in others by diminished excitability, such as drowsiness, amnesia, impaired concentration and judgment, and diminished pulse. The onset and duration of these withdrawal symptoms are reported by different authors in terms of days (20), weeks (30), or months 112, 28), obviously an inconsistency if one attempts to relate these to nicotine deprivation. In contrast to drugs of addiction, withdrawal from tobacco never constitutes a threat to life. These facts indicate clearly the absence ol physical dependence.

This view is supported further by consideration of the diversity of methods which are reported (16, pp. 540-546) to be successful in treatment of smoking withdrawal. Most methods have been based strictly on symptomatic treatment; for those who are depressed, stimulants such as caffeine, theobromine, and metratoh and for those who are excited, sedatives, barbiturates, and the like. Hansel til) treated his patients by stimulating them in the daytime with 10 to 15 mg of dextroamphetamine and putting them to sleep at night with a sedative. At least this treatment has the advantage that it dors not interfere with the usual patterns of diurnal and nocturnal behavior.

Ik contrast to addicting drugs, the tendency to continue to increase the dose of tobacco is definitely self-limiting because of the appearance of nicotine toxicity. Undoubtedly there is a considerable variation among individuals in inherited capabilities to tolerate nicotine. In some individuals this may completely deprive them of the pleasure of using tobacco (30). Although some tolerance is also Acquired with repeated use. this is not sufficient to permit the nervous system to be exposed to ever-increasing nicotine concentrations as is the case with addicting drugs. This in itself mav militate against the development of the adaptive changes in nerve cells which create physical dependence-It is a well-known fact among smokers and other users of tobacco that certain toxic effects such as nausea and vomiting, which accompany the initial use of tobacco, disappear with repealed use. This tolerance is only relative and excessive use may at any time initiate these signs and symptoms even in the heavy smoker or other user (6) -Acquired tolerance may take two forms:

(a)   A low grade tissue tolerance in mucous and pulmonary membranes to the irritants in tobacco or tobacco smoke (81. This probably involves adaptive changes in ceQ membranes, similar to those which occur with other local irritants, and t reduction in sensory nervous input permitting more prolonged exposure to those irritants without unpleasant subjective manifestations.

(b)   Specific organ tolerance to nicotine which is also relatively low grade and comparatively' short-lived. This tolerance, which may permit the ad-ministraton of nicotine in quantities several times larger than those which would induce toxic signs and symptoms initially (13), varies with age (17), sex (30), and duration of exposure. Differences in metabolic disposition aie not enough to account for tolerance (7,29,31). Animal studies indicate considerable tolerance to small but tittle if any to convulsant or lethal doses (2, 4).

Another form of adaptation to tobacco which is psychologic in origin is also common to many other drag habits. It might better be termed toleration than tolerance; the user "puts up with" symptoms of irritation and nicotine toxicity which are unacceptable to the novice. Many smokers accept penutent cough, bouts of nausea, and other unpleasant manifestations of irritation and toxicity.

Much controversy concerns the relationship of smoking to other drag habits especially to those agents which are addicting like alcohol, the opiates, and others. Since the motivating factor in the habitual use of drugs of any type is the deiire to change the status quo in order to achieve pleasure, to relieve monotony, to abolish tension or grief, etc., it is not unusual that many individuals in search of such gratification will habitually rdy on several substance*. Attempts to establish cause and effect relationships among the several habits have not been meaningful. A more plausible explanation is that the personality characteristics which lead to the search for change may find mild expression in smoking, coffee and moderate alcohol drinking, and in an exaggerated form by abusing the narcotic and stimulant drugs of addiction.

Measures for Cuke of Tobacco Habit

Measure* directed at the cure of the tobacco habit hare been designed principally to modify or abolish the psychogenic, sensory, or pharmacologic drives (16, pp. 540-5461.

In the psychotherapeutic area these include psychoanalytic technics, hypnotism, antismoking campaigns based upon fear of health consequences, religion, group psychotherapy (similar to Alcoholics Anonymous), and tranquilizing or stimulant drugs.

Modification of tobacco taste by astringent mouthwashes (silver nitrate and copper sulfate*, bitters (quinine, quassia I. local anesthetics iberaocaine lozenge*). Mibstitulion of other tastes (essential oils and flavors), and production of a dry mouth (atropine or stramonium) are all measures which have been aimed at diminishing the sensory drives.

Administration of oral lobeline, a substance from Indian tobacco, with weak nicotine-like actions as a nicotine substitute has had rather extensive trial (5. 21, 36 >, and commercial preparations are available. Carefully controlled studies have failed to establish the value of lobeline (1, 18, 24).

Of the methods cited above, those which deal with the psychogenic drives have l)een the more successful since ultimate realization of the goal involves the firm mental resolve of the individual to stop smoking. There is no acceptable evidence that this goal can be achieved solely by modifying sensory drives or using tobacco substitutes.

SUMMAHY

The habitual use of tobacco is related primarily to psychological and social drives, reinforced and per|ietuated by the pharmacological actions of nicotine on the central nervous: system, the latter being interpreted subjectively either as stimulant or tranquilizing: dependent upon the individual response. \icotine-free tobacco or other plant materials do not satisfy the needs of those who acquire the tobacco habit.

The tobacco habit should he characterized as an habituation rather than an addiction, in conformity with accepted World Health Organization definition*, sincr once established there is little tendency to increase the dose; psychic but not physical dependence is developed: and the detrimental effects are primarily on the individual rather than society. \*o characteristic absti-nenceSyndrnmc is developed upon withdrawal.

Acquired tolerance, even though comparatively low grade, is important in overcoming nausea and other mild signs of nicotine tonicity and is a factor in continued use of tobacco.

Discontinuation of smoking, although possessing the difficulties attendant upon extinction of any conditioned rellex. is accomplished best by reinforcing factors which interru|* the psychogenic drives. Nicotine substitutes or supplementary medications have not been proven to be of major benefit in breaking the habit.

BENEFICIAL EFFECTS OF TOBACCO

Evaluation of the effect* of smokinp on health would lack perspective if no consideration was oven to the possible benefit! to be derived from the occasional or habitual use of tobacco. A large list of possible physical benefits can be compiled from a fairly large literature, much of which is based upon anecdote or clinical impression.

Even in those circumstances where a substantial body of fact and experience supports the attribute, the purported benefits are comparatively inconsequential in a medical sense. Examples are: (a) maintenance of good intestinal tone and bowel habits (23), and (b) an anti-obesity effect upon reduced hunger and a possible elevation in blood sugar 13). Insofar as these are supported by fact they represent tangible assets and cannot be totally dismissed. On the other hand, it would be difficult to support the position that these attributes would carry much weight in counter-balancing a significant health hazard.

But it is not an easy matter to reach a simple and reasonable conclusion concerning the mental health aspects of smoking. The purported benefits oh mental health are so intangible and elusive, so intricately woven into the whole fabric of human behavior, so subject to moral interpretation and censure, so difficult of medical evaluation and so controversial in nature that few scientific groups have attempted to study the subject.

The drive to use tobacco being fundamentally psychogenic in origin has the same basis *� other drug habits and in a targe fraction of the American population appears to satisfy the total need of the individual for a psychological crutch.

An attempted evaluation of smoking on mental health becomes more realistic if one is willing to confront the <ruestion, ridiculous as it may seem. What would satisfy the psychological needs of the 70,000,000 Americans who smoked b 1963 if they were suddenly deprived of tobacco? Gearly there is no definitive answer to this question but it may be illuminated by analogy with the past

Historically, man has always found and used substances with actual or presumed ptychopharmacologic effects ranging in activity from the innocuous ginseng root to the most violent poisons, fn China, traditions and custom endowed the ginseng root with remarkable health-giving properties. The strength of this belief was so strong and the supply so short that the root often became a medium of exchange. The value of the root increased in direct proportion to its similarity in appearance to the human figure.

The remarkable aspect of this situation is that the ginseng root is historically the world's most renowned placebo, since science has failed to establish that it contains any active pharmacologic principle.

It would be redundant to recount here all of the potent substances at the other end of the scale. It will suffice to note that this human drive is %a universal and may be so powerful that man has always been willing to risk and accept the moat unpleasant tymptoms and signs�hallucinations and delusions, ataxia and paralysis, violent vomiting and convulsions, poverty and malnutrition, destructive organic lesions, and even death.

355
pgNbr=389
If the thesis is accepted that the fundamental nature of man will not change significantly in the foreseeable future, it �then safe to predict that man will continue to utilize pharmacologic aids in his search for contentment. In the best interests of the public health this should be accomplished with substances which carry minimal hazard to the individual and for society as a whole. Tn relating this principle to tobacco it may be reemphasfoed that the hazard, serious as it may be, relates mainly to the individual, whereat the indiscriminate use of more potent pharmacologic agents without medical supervision creates � gamut of social problems which currently constitutes a major concern of government as indicated by the recent (1962) White House Conference on Narcotic and Drug Abuse (32).

Summary

Medical perspective requires recognition of significant beneficial effects of smoking primarily in the area of mental health.

These benefits originate in a psychogenic search for contentment and are measurable only in terms of individual behavior. Since no means of quantising these benefits is apparent the Committee finds no basis for a judgment which would weigh benefits versus hazards of smoking as it may apply to the general population.

Scientific Basis of the Report

The Hedlh Consequences ofSmokfnff�SO Years ofProgms

The statements and conclusions throughout this report are documented by the citation of studies published in the scientific literature. For the most part, this report cites peer-reviewed Journal articles, including reviews that integrate findings from numerous studies, and books by recognised experts. When a study has been accepted for publication, but the publication has not yet been issued,

owing to the delay between acceptance and final publication, the study is referred to as In press." This report also refers, on occasion, to unpublished research such as a presentation at a professional meeting or a personal communication from the researcher. These personal references are to acknowledge experts whose research is in progress.

Major Conclusions from the Report

1.    The century-long epidemic of cigarette smoking has caused an enormous avoidable public health tragedy. Since the first Surgeon Generals report in 1964 more than 20 million premature deaths can be attributed to cigarette smoking.

2.    The tobacco epidemic was initiated and has been sustained by the aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry, which has deliberately mislfd the public on the risks of smoking cigarettes.

3.     Since the 1964 Surgeon General's report, cigarette smoking has been causally linked to diseases of nearly all organs of the body, to diminished health status, and to harm to the fetus. Even 50 years after the first Surgeon General's report, research continues to newly identify diseases caused by smoking, including such common diseases as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and colorectal cancer.

4.    Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke has been causally linked to cancer, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases, and to adverse effects on the health of infants and children.

5.    The disease risks from smoking by women have risen sharply over the last SO yean and are now equal to those for men for lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular diseases.

6.     In addition to causing multiple diseases, cigarette smoking has many other adverse effects on the body, such as causing inflammation and impairing immune function.

7.    Although cigarette smoking has declined significantly since 1964, very large disparities in tobacco use remain across groups defined by race, ethnicity, educational level, and socioeconomic status and across regions of the country.

8.    Since the 1964 Surgeon General's report, comprehensive tobacco control programs and policies have been proven effective for controlling tobacco use. Further gains can be made with the full, forceful, and sustained use of these measures.

9.    The burden of death and disease from tobacco use in the United States is overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products; rapid elimination of their use will dramatically reduce this burden.

10.  For 50 years the Surgeon General's reports on smoking and health have provided a critical scientific foundation for public health action directed at reducing tobacco use and preventing tobacco-related disease and premature death.

and initiation of smoking among young people, actions that would eliminate depiction of tobacco use in movies that are produced and rated as appropriate for children and adolescents could have a significant effect toward preventing youth from becoming tobacco users,

The 2009 Pr**nt Ail Ogarttte TMfkking (PACT) Act dosed a loophole enabling individuals to purchase tobacco products via the Internet or mail without paying the appropriate taxes. The FACT Act ensures the collection of federal, state, and local tobacco taxes on cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products sold via the Internet or other mail-order sales and makes tobacco products not mailable by the U^. Postal Service (Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids 2010). It also restricts youth access to tobacco products via Internet and mail-order sales by requiring age verification prior to sale and upon delivery.

Tobacco Product Litigation

When the nation's first Surgeon General's report on smoking and health was released in 1964, litigation against cigarette manufacturer* concerning the health effects of their products had been ongoing for 10 years. It would take an additional 30 years until tobacco litigation began to have a deep impact on the landscape of tobacco control. This history of tobacco product litigation is described in more detail online at www.surgeongeneral.gov in Appendix 14.2. Additionally, a summary of major tobacco litigation casts is also provided online in Appendix 143.

litigation against tobacco companies has proven to be a tool for advancing the fundamental public health goal of tobacco control�reducing the morbidity and mortality caused by tobacco products. It can contribute to tobacco control in several ways:

�   Tbbacco litigation has offered an opportunity to shed Ightonthepractk^oftobjuxornanufictureriby exposing once-secret internal documents and giving a voice to former industry insiders (Bero 2003).

�   The media coverage of tobacco litigation serves to educate and reinforce messaging about the Health risks associated with the use of tobacco products (Dunlop and Warner 2010).

�   Litiftttoo^whensucccssftd.canieedtoirtcreasesin price due to the M^i cost of verdicts or settlements to manufacturers, which results in reduced consumption of tobacco products, particularly among youth (ChsJouofca and Pacuia 2001).

�   Vtxy large punitive damages have the potential to encourage manufacturers to examine their practices and change behaviors mat couJd trigger such monetary sanctions (Table 14 J) (Guardino and Daynard 2005).

�   Settlements may include provisions that restrict marketing practices that might be difficult to achieve through legislation (Jacobson and Warner 1999).

�   Litigation complements other tobacco control efforts and can serve as a public reminder of the need for state and federal policy interventions (Ver-nick etai. 2007).

�   By focusing on the conduct of the manufacturers and their role in the Injuries at issue, tobacco litigation plays an important role in denormalixmg the industry and its practices that contribute to the toll of tobacco use on public health (Vemick et at. 2007).

State Attorney General Cases

The 2000 Surgeon General's report and Appendix 14.2 (found online at www.surgeortgeneral.gov) provide a summary of several of the most influential cases, including the State Attorney General cases, which started in 1994. The first four of these lawsuits against the tobacco industry to recover health care expenditures for treating tobacco-related ailments of Medicaid recipients were brought by Mississippi, Minnesota, Florida, and Texas. In each of these first four cases, the tobacco industry settled separately with the state. All together, the four settlements resulted in the tobacco industry agreeing to pay a total of $35.3 billion over a25-year period (Miura et ai. 2006).

Shortly after settling separately with Mississippi, Minnesota, Florida, and Texas, the tobacco industry sought to resolve the outstanding state-brought Medicaid reimbursement lawsuits by entering into a comprehensive settlement agreement. On November 23,1998, the four largest tobacco companies (Brown & Williamson, Lorillard, Philip Morris, and RJ. Reynolds) entered into the MSA with the remaining 46 states and five territories. They entered into this agreement after failing to reach a congressionally brokered global settlement, which would have given the tobacco industry certain immunities from liability going forward (Gh/el and Giants 2004),

Dear DeBaun1

Pursuant to my telephone conversation with you and Jim Ravlln on Friday, and my conversation with you today, please find enclosed the substance of a proposed letter to tthe Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health.

X am of the present opinion that we should eliminate from the draft of April 23* 19o3 any references which are designed to "play up" the competitive qualities of Brown ft Williamson's products.

I am of the further opinion that any description in the letter to the Committee of the methods and steps Involved in the various scientific research programs conducted by Brown ft Williamson must necessarily be so vague and Incomplete aa to be irksome to the reader.  However, I am also of the opinion, that, under the circumstances, it la necessary that Brown ft Williamson say something in reply to the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee's request.  Therefore, it Is my suggestion that we state simply that we have conducted no medical research, having left that to TIRC, and then proceed to enumer-ate the various scientific research programa aponaored or financed by Brown ft Williamson without commenting upon them and inform the Surgeon General's Committee that in the event any particular program la of interest to the Committee It may be assured of Brown ft Williamson's full cooperation.  In the.;event a program proves to be of interest to the Committee and a request for details is made, we will meet that problem when it arises. I repeat it is unfortunate that Brown ft Williamson must submit anything, but this approach seems to me to be the moot innocuous of the alternatives.

I enclose a copy of Bowman Gray's letter about which         fj>

I spoke to you.  Reynolds' handling of the matter is of course    2!

simplified by its being in a position to deliver a considerable    S

amount of published matter.                                                                           v

In reconsideration I suggest Brown ft Williamson not   ��

{�  attach Dr. Haggard*a study, as to do so might only raise a *.-., question as to why the findings of the other programs were not also attached.

I am of the opinion that reference to scientific pro-grama on which Brown & Williamson plans to embark in the future is probably gratuitous, in that it is not responsive to the request and certainly not helpful to the Committee from a scientific point of view and for that reason may not be well received by the Committee.

."':'        From a litigation standpoint I believe it axiomatic .;-.�;; that it is beet to submit the least scientific material possible V      consonant with the objective of not irritating the Committee. As I mentioned on the telephone I would prefer to see only previously published material submitted If you find you have enough such material to warrant submitting it,  I await the outcome of your search in that regard.'

Sincerely yours

In your lettor of March 6, 1968 you extended to no an invitation to aervo aa a menbor of an infomal working group to develop a "less hazardous cigorotce".   Titla firoup, I understand, in a vubcoimlttoe of tho Lung Cancer Taak Force of trio National Caacar Institutu,   From tho dlacuiuion of tha ooetlng I to Id on March 11, 1968, I also understand that tho rtroup win concern itaolf with tha devolopftiant of a cigarette which wifht \>a regarded as loat hasardous titan cigarettes now available from tho standpoint of soma ailagod causal connoctioni botveon tha cnoko of such clgarettai and hunaa lung cancor.

i on agraeaiiio to serving on the informal work group rofurred to by you and making available my experience and kaowlodgo in research relating to tobacco and enoking If It la clearly understood that I a� in no manner accepting tho vlow (1) that present clgarottea aro hnsardous or (2) that tho flfcoko of such cigarettes causal or contributes to tha dovalopswnt of huwtn lung cancer*    It la important that this rasorvatlon bo notod, particularly In light of tha unfortunately dusignated purpose of tho group, naiwly to develop a "loss hazardous cinaratta"*    Periiap* a butter working arronrseuint and understanding uy all involved could Ua achieved if 'tho purpose wore rophreaod lu a laannar that would not asmudu the existence of a "nazard" that has not been sciontiflealiy ttfttabllsiwd*

Because of tho lack of scientific, oxpurlawntal or clinical uvldonco that smoking clgnrettos cause* 6r contributes to tho development of lung concor, It saoiM to um that boforo isoanlngfui work can bo coimwncad on a "lusa tiasardoua clgarotta" it must first bo ootabllshod that there is som causal connection*   Only than could truly wanlngful work ba startod to detoraloe any particular causal agoac or agents In tho smoke and tha boat

FOR RELEASE FEBRUARY 26, 11100 A.M.

Little Rock�J. C. B. Ehringhaus, Jr., vice president and counsel for the Washington-based Tobacco Institute, said here today that the 1972 report of the Surgeon General to Congress on smoking and health "insults the scientific community* and that "the number fine health problem is not cigarette smoking, but is the extent to which public health officials may knowingly mislead the American public."

Speaking at the Arkansas Wholesale Grocers' Association, Inc., annual meeting, Ehringhaua said the recently released report is "another example of...'press conference science'�an absolute masterpiece of bureaucratic obfuscation."

Ehringhaus lashed out at the smoking/health report on various counts. He said the Surgeon General "ignores by misrepresentation the researchers whose contrary findings he chooses to omit from the report."

As for the allegation that smoking has deleterious effects on pregnant women and their unborn children, Ehringhaus pointed out that a recent American Medical  Association full page newspaper ad flatly stated: "The rate of infant mortality hag dropped 25* in ten years."

Ehringhaus noted that a "new section" of the report dealt with allegedly hazardous effects of smoking on nonsmokers. But, the tobacco industry representative said, just three days after the report's release

the Surgeon General want on television and saidi  "The real problem is that...even in a crowded room, or an automobile, we can't measure the effect of the trace chemicals upon the nonamoker."

Ehringhaus noted that cigarette tax collections in Arkansas for 1971 amounted to more than $27 million. Federal excises on cigarettes for the entire country came to $2.1 billion that same year. Altogether, he said, 51 percent of the price of a package of cigarettes is represented by excise taxes�a grand total approaching $5 billion yearly.

SUBJECT: The Roper Proposal QBBBRAL COMMENTS

Xt is my strong belief that we now have an opportunity to take the initiative in the cigarette controversy, and start to turn it around.

For nearly twenty years, this industry has employed ,a single strategy to defend itself on three major fronts � litigation, politics, and public opinion.

While the strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed over the years helping ua  win imtwrtarit battles, it is only fair to say that it is not - nor was it intended, to be � a vehicle for victory. On the contrary, it has always been a holding strategy, consisting of

� creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it

� advocating the public's right to smoke, without actually urging them to take up the practice

� encouraging objective scientific research as the only way to resolve the question of health hazard

On the litigation front for which the strategy was designed, it has been successful. While we have not lost a liability case, � this is not because juries have rejected the anti-smoking arguments.

On the political front, the strategy has helped wake possible an orderly retreat. But it is fair to say that It

TIMN 0077551

r

PLAINTIFFS EXHIBIT

Page 2.

has not stemmed the pressure for new legislation, despite the major concessions.we have made,

Qn the public opinion front, however, our situation has deteriorated and will continue to worsen. This erosion will have an adverse effect on the other fronts, because here is where the beliefs, attitudes and actions of judges, juries, elected officials and government employees are formed,

THE STRATEGIC IMPASSB

As an industry, therefore, we are committed to an ill-defined middle ground which is articulated by variations on the theme that, "the case is not proved." As the recent history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam demonstrated, it is impossible to hold the public on a middle course for any length of time. There seetna to be no way that mass public opinion can engage in a controversy and choose an answer that goes beyond the range of either/or.

In the cigarette controversy, the public � especially those who are present and potential supporters (e.g. tobacco AtatA congressmen *nd heavy s motors) � sauct pcrcaiva, understand, and believe in evidence to sustain their opinions that smoking may not be the causal factor.

* As things stand, we supply them with too little in the way of ready-made credible alternatives.

THB ALTERNATIVES

Two such credible alternatives exist:

1) The Constitutional Hypothesis i.e.' people who smoke tend to differ importantly from people who do not, in their heredity, in constitutional makeup, in patterns of life, and in the pressure under which they live.

2)  The Multi-factorial Hypothesis i.e. as science advances,, more and more factors come under suspicion as contributing to the illnesses for which smoking is

blamed � air pollution, viruses, npTiMnuf (tfk'J'JJCK'J

food additives, occupational hazards and stresses.

Our 1370 public opinion survey showed that a majority (52%) believed that cigarettes are only one of the many causes of smokers having more illnesses. It also showed that half of the people who believed that smokers have more illness than non-smokers accepted the constitutional hypothesis as the explanation,

Thus, there are millions of people who would be receptive to a new message! statingt

Cigarette smoking may not be the health hazard that the anti-smoking people say it is because other alternatives are at least as probable

The Roper Proposal would be a persuasive (if not strictly scientific) medium for this message , which we have done Little to develop in a systematic or comprehensive way.

Following la my outline of the steps required to start a shift in public opinion if the Roper Proposal Is accepted.

A SCHKARIO FOR ACTIOS

1) Select a panel of experts to consult on the design of the study. Ideally they would be prestige figures who would initially have a solid contribution to make and who would also be willing to endorse the study publicly at a later stage.

2) Conduct the pilot study.

3) If favorable, present the results to carefully selected members of the following key groupsi

The purpose is two-fold (a) to gain the support and participation of friends and (b) to neutralize any adverse action they may be brewing. For example? By seeing Secretary Buta at this time we might gain some degree of participation from the Agriculture Department. By seeing Secretary Richardson we might possibly forestall a PHS anti-smoking drive.

4) Conduct' the full scale survey.

5) If the results are favorable, release them as

a book in both hard cover and paper back version, hopefully published by a legitimate house. In effect, such a volume would be a counter - surgeon General's Report. The principal authors would be Burns Roper and an eminent research scientist. The advisory panel� hopefully broadened as a result of Step 3 --would write the introduction. The industry's funding rble would be fully acknowledged.

6) As a book the material would be marketed and promoted in all the many ways available! magazine condensation, TV and Radio talk shows, newspaper reviews and interviews, advertising, gift distribution, etc. etc.

And best of all, it would only have to be seen � not read � to be believed...just like the Surgeon General's report.

Tobacco Institute Annual Meeting

January 10, 1980 New York, New York

Whoever wrote that what comes in like a lion goes out like a lamb; or what'starts with a bang ends with a whimper, did not work at The Tobacco Institute,  1979 rushed in at a hectic pace, maintained full speed, and is departing in the same way. Like previous years, it was a year of intense activity and high pressure--externally and internally.

But 1979 was different in one respect. We were better prepared. Because we had worked hard on our interna^ organization, we were able to deal more effectively with our external pressures.  We were even able to spare some extra time to orchestrate our individual efforts, to move toward an overall strategy, to set goals and objectives, to plan ahead,

A review of the projects completed this year may justify your confidence in our ability to achieve the objectives in our business plan.

You directed us to improve industry intelligence, develop our support capabilities, and to improve scientific information services. And we have made gains.

You mandated strengthened state and local activities, strengthened Federal relations, and improved public understanding and communication. And we have made strides.

You also asked us to strengthen Institute direction and control. And we have made progress.

As a result, some notable achievements were registered this

year.

t The Surgeon General's media event was pre-empted by an

Institute first-strike news conference. For the first time

in the history of the cigarette controversy, a Secretary of

HEW had to share the spotlight. In fact, we won top billing

that night on all networks.

� After a two-and-one-half year hiatus, the President of the Institute has reopened face-to-face talks with a Secretary of HEW.  Most credit" for this must go to President Carter for removing the obstacle to direct contact.  In fact, good contacts have been re-established with the Executive Branch.

� The Federal Trade Commission reign of regulatory terror nay be nearlng an end, thanks to the restraining hand of the Senate Commerce Committee. The Commission's ability to invoke the highly subjective concept of "unfairness" as

an independent basis for regulating commercial advertising is under increasing attack by industry and the Congress,

t the voters of Dade County defeated an anti-smoking referendum. .An expensive campaign fight culminated in a narrow victory, , but a victory nevertheless, in a Mghstakes political contest with great political consequences.

t Our State legislative scorVcard showed many more victories than defeats. Out of*113 bills introduced, 8 were enacted, 49 were defeated, and 56 are still pending. In Jfew Jersey, we helped enact an amendment preventing such agencies as the Public Health Council"from running wild with public smoking regulations.   -

� Another first was registered with completion of a program of mass-media magazine advertising. Pre-publication research    * showed a good*likelihood of favorable opinion change, and- " post-publication research"has provided help in planning future ad campaigns,

I Communications have been on the uptrend this year- Our four speakers covered a quarter of a million miles, logging nearly 800 appearances, including 300 hours on the air. Our new publications unit turned out a dozen new publications and distributed about a quarter of a million copies. The Tobacco Observer has reached a circulation of 86,000. Our films have been seen by about 750,000 people this year--for a cumulative audience of lh million.

� Recognition of the industry's economic impact has been enhanced' with completion and widespread distribution of the Wharton study. Further development of this economic data bank Is underway,

� Coalitions and alliance building has received attention. Our ties with labor, business, the black caucus, and. urban interests are becoming stronger and mutually rewarding.

r Our contacts with Congress, which have always been good, are now even better.  Through a systematic program of Hill coverage, we can now count nearly 300 Representatives and 7S Senators as grade "A" contacts, which means that we know them--but more importantly, they know us.

� Our legal defense against smoking restrictions was bolstered when the Institute's outside counsel won a test case in Virginia, where the State Supreme Court struck down a local anti-smoking ordinance ^s  "an unconstitutional exercise of the city's policy power.'1

� We were Involved Internationally, now that ICOSI was established and in operation. In cooperation with trade association executives from other countries, TI staff

TIMN 0066635

participated as team members in the reporting from Stockholm of the proceedings of the Fourth World Conference on Smoking and Health last June. Earlier, we attended an international tobacco Industry conference at Zurich to compare notes on so-called counterneasures in. various countries.

While the Institute's record of accomplishment in 1979 has been substantial, so have its problems. We have made progress in resolving many of them. But problems do not disappear with the year's end. They persist.

Hopefully, continued improvement of our internal operations, in accordance with our business plan objectives, will increase our capacity to more effectively deal with the external environment. We will soon have a test of our capability. In the next few days, "the Surgeon General will, release yet another report, this   tint� on women and smoking.  W<r have completed a plan for getting our share of the press coverage surrounding this media event.

Here is the inventory of the issues which will demand our best effort throughout 1980;

1. Increasing smoking restriction activity. The number of state bills has increased about 10 percent over the last year. On the local level, our field staff, TAN volunteers, and others report 130 local restrictive measures--a sharp increase in activity.  Referenda battles are also looming, in California, in Dade County, and a new state--Oregon.

TIMN 0066636

PT03777-O005
pgNbr=426
* Other State legislation affecting the tobacco industry is also up for consideration: 160 bills pertaining to advertising, insurance, health research, minors, tar and nicotine.

A significant emerging problem is statewide sampling legislation with 7 bills introduced this year-, over S last year. Minneapolis and'St. Paul passed sampling restrictions this year, and bans are pending in Chicago and Seattle.

2. A deceptive calm blankets the1 Federal front, due largely to pre-election year preparation. Mot one of the 21 anti-tobacco bills has moved beyond the introduction stage. Neither Rep. Waxman or Sen. Kennedy has had time for tobacco. Sen�  Hart has even consulted us on an asbestos, compensation bill. Rep. Johnson of Colorado, who mounted several frontal attacks on the tobacco support program, is stepping down. To these glad tidings we can add the possibility of favorable legislation as a wave of regulatory reform sweeps over the Federal Trade Commission.

But we cannot afford to be lulled into a false sense of security. Several threats do indeed exist; they can be fueled by adverse publicity; they can lead to legislation or regulation.  For example: �Self-extinguishing cigarettes.

--The social cost of smoking impacts national health insurance, social security disability payments, and most recently has been used by some insurance companies as a sales promotion gimmick.

--The blame-tobacco-tactic used by embattled industries, such as asbestos and chemicals, will increase along with their problems.

--The inevitable inclusion of smoking in the government's expanding health promotion and disease prevention programs will call attention to smoking among teens and pregnant women. --Cigarette excise problems will return with pressure from States to collect revenue lost to contraband traffic.

Success in dealing with these emerging problems will depend, in large measure, on our success in improving industry credibility. This is the linchpin of our efforts, for our      * credibility stands or falls on both what we say and what we do--as a trade association and as an industry.

Credibility is an integrating concept, requiring us to combine our resources, our resourcefulness, and our'will to create in the minds of others the expectation that we will act responsibly--delivering what we promise and promising no more than we can deliver.

Achieving industry credibility, therefore, involves all individuals and all departments of The Tobacco Institute: state activities, federal editions, public relations, professional and administrative, headquarters staff and field personnel.  And most importantly, you--the leaders of our member companies. ' It is no longer sufficient to have a superior lobbying effort in Washington and in the states, or to possess an effective public communications apparatus, or to coramand skilled professional experts.

Accordingly, the. Institute will propose positions on each emerging Issue. We will give you our analysis, present alternatives, and make recoimendations for policy decisions--!^ your decisions'. We will approach government regulation of the tobacco business in a business-lilce manner, tempered by our political, PR, and professional judgment and expertise.

In the year ahead, we intend to carry out our mission of leadership and direction by a concentrated and coordinated effort to increase our credibility.

In llwory, gradually reducing the cortteiil and yield of nicotine in cigarettes over a period of many years, using design features that make compensation difficult or impossible, might lessen smokers' dependence on nicotine, low-nicotine cigarettes have also been proposed as a method to prevent new smokers (primarily youth) from ever establishing ukotine dependence (Benowit* and Henningfield 1994; Henningfield et al. 1998; Benowitx et al. 2007; teller et al. 2009). However, the potential role of nicotine analogues in maintaining addiction is poorly understood

A commercial cigarette with very low nicotine content was introduced in lest markets in 1989 under the brand name Next (Butschky et at 1995). The nicotine content of Next appeared to be lower than the levels hypothesised by Benowitz and Henningfield (1994) lo be

the addictive threshold. Tlie test market ended in 1991 when Philip Morris withdrew the product from the market. Quest was a low-nicotine cigarette developed by Vector Tobacco (Rose and Behm 2004; Vector Tobacco 2004). Three products were available: (1) a cigarette with 0.6 mg of nicotine and 10 mg of tar per cigarette, as determined by PTC machine measurements; (2) a cigarette with 0.3 mg of nicotine and 10 mg of tar per cigarette; and (3) a "nicotine-free" cigarette with no more than 0.05 mg of nicotine and 10 mg of tar per cigarette (Vector Tobacco 2004). It was unclear how long and hem-often smokers would use the "nicotine-free" version rather than versions that contained higlier levels of nicotine and whether the two versions with nicotine would hinder the desire and ability to stop smoking.

Cigarette-Like Products

In 1988, RJ. Reynolds launched a new era of novel products vvilli Premier, a nicotine-delivering product similar in site and appearance to a conventional cigarette but consisting of an aluminum canister that contained alumina beads impregnated with glycerin, propylene glycol, and a nicotine-rich tobacco extract (Stade 1993; Slack and Henningfield 1998). Heat from a carbon fuel element vaporised material adjacent to the alumina beads, and these vapors condensed into more proximal segments to form the aerosol that was puffed and inhaled by the consumer (Stade and Henningfield 1998). Compared with conventional cigarettes. Premier delivered similar doses of nicotine, higher levels of carbon monoxide (CO), and reduced levels of many other toxicants (WHO 2001). Premier was test marketed in the United States in 1988 but was soon withdrawn because of poor sales (Slack- and Henmngfiekt 1998).

More recently, tobacco companies have developed several other novel cigarette-like products that deliver nicotine to the consumer (Straiten et aL 2001; Slade et al. 20021. Eclipse (RJ. Reynolds) uses a technology similar to that developed for Premier (Slade and Hen-nkigfield 1998; Stade et aL 2092): the heat source is a carbon fuel element, and nicotine and glycerin are vaporised from an aluminum-lined chamber tilled willi what the manufacturer described as "highly processed tobacco" and mixed with glycerin. Doth human and machine- testing data indicate mat these products provide no clear benefit to users over conventional

cigarettes. A report commissioned by the Commonwealth of Massacltusetls Department of Public Health (bund thai intensive machine smoking of Eclipse delivered levels of key lung and cancer-causing toxicants (eg., acrolein. CO) similar to, or higlier than, those from two commercial cigarette brands (Lahstat 2000). A complication in evaluating the toxicity of Eclipse is thatseveral prototypes were test marketed (Slade el al. 2002). It is not clear wliether changes not disclosed by the manufacturer account for the variability across studies (Stapleton et at. 1998; Lee et al. 2004; Breland et al. 2006). Nonetheless, it appears that volunteers who had been exposed to Eclipse (Shiftman et al. 2004; Hughes et al. 2005) or had heard of it believed it lo be less harmful than conventional cigarettes. Furthermore, concerns have been raised that Eclipse and Premier coutd be modified to deliver other drugs, including illicit drugs (Cone and Henningfield 1989; Steckley et al. 2002). Accord (Philip Morris) consists of a specially designed "cigarette" used in combination with an ignition system (Slade and Henningfield 1998). The handheld, battery-operated, microchip-controlled product heats a cigarette-like tobacco roll when it is puffed (Slade and Henningfield 1998). Although actual-use studies of Accord have not been performed, preliminary laboratory studies with volunteers suggest the possibility that actual human exposure to nicotine and toxicants might substantially exceed that predicted by Philip Morris' tests (Bttchliaiter et al. 2001; Breland et al. 2002; Philip Morris USA 2005).

toxicants coukl reduce disease risk was supported by previous Surgeon General's reports (USDHEW 1969). In 1906, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended "the progressive reduction of (lie 'tar' and nicotine content of cigarette smoke" (USDHEW 1966, p- 2), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that it would generally permit cigarette com* panics to make marketing claims about tar and nicotine yields as long as those statements nvre based on a uniform machine-based test method for measuring lar and nicotine yields, subsequently known as "the PTC method" (Peeler 1996; Pillsbur/ 1006).

Efforts to reduce tar and nicotine yields as measured on the basis of machine-smoking conditions were successful. The sales-weighted deliveries in U.S. cigarette smoke decreased from 38 milligrams (mg) of lar and 2,7 mg of nicotine in 1954 to 12 mg of tar and 0.95 mg of nicotine in 1993 (Hoffmann et al. 1996). Machine measurements of tar have shown little change since then, and machine measurements of nicotine delivery have remained at approximately 0.9 mg per cigarette since 1981 (Federal Register 1995,1996; Slade et al. 1995; Hurl and Robertson 1998: Kessler 2001).

Unfortunately, with the accrual and evaluation of additional data, the evidence today does not demonstrate that efforts to lower machine-measured tar and nicotine yields actually decreased the health risks of smoking, primarily because these changes did not reduce smokers' actual exposure to tobacco toxicants (NCI 2001; USDHHS 2004). Indeed, to the extent that filters and other efforts to reduce machine-measured tar and nicotine reduced smokers' health concerns, and thereby delayed quitting ami/or increased cigarette use, they may have contributed loan overall increase in cigarette-caused mortality (Straiten etal. 2001).

As mentioned above, for example, the first effort to change the design of cigarettes was the addition of tfie filter. In theory, use of filter technologies can remove substantial amounts of a wide variety of toxicants (Browne 1999; Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997). In fact, however, evidence on the ability of filters to reduce harm is not clear (Sladc 1993; NCI 2001; Stratton et al. 2001). And, some novel filter designs may introduce new toxicants such as asbestos (Slade 1993), carbon (Pauly et al. 1997), and glass (Pauly et al. 1998). The wkk variation in filler technology across brands and over lime precludes general conclusions about whether filters Increased or decreased exposure of smokers to toxicants.

Similarly, a variety of design features made it possible for cigarette smokers to compensate, that is, easily Ingest severalfold higher amounts of tar and nicotine than the yields obtained when using the machine-based FTC method (Djordjevic et al. 2000; NCI 2001; Stratton et al.

16  Chapter 2

2001; WHO 2003c). Most important was the introduction of ventilation holes in the cigarette filters, which allowed smoke to escape during machine testing. In the 1980s, researchers discovered thai smokers covered these ventilation holes with their fingers, negating the effect of the holes in reducing smoke exposure (Koxtowski et al. 1980, 2002,2006), Moreover, subsequent research demonstrated that the use of ventilation holes produced higher levels of free-base nicotine, which led to a more addictive product as well as deeper lung Initiation of cooler and less harsh smoke (Stratton etal. 2001;Pankow etal. 2003a,b; Watson et al, 2004). Driven by nicotine addiction and enabled by cigarettes (hat delivered smoother, cooler smoke diluted by ambient air, smokers could easily compensate for reduced delivery of nicotine by increasing smoke intake per cigarette and per day, thus maintaining high levels of disease risk fNCI 2001: Thun and Bums 2001).

Tobacco industry documents, many of which are available at the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library at DCSR clearly demonstrate that at least by the mid-1970s the tobacco industry ukII understood the importance of creating heal Ih reassurance messages in order to alleviate health concerns, and that one important method of doing so was through claims of tow deliveries of tar. For example, a 1977 British American Tobacco marketing report concluded, "All work in this area should be directed towards providing consumer reassurance Imp/mis in origmel) about ciftrelles and Hie smoking liabil. This can be provided in different ways, e.g. by claimed low deliveries, by the perception of low deliveries and by the perception of mildness"' (Short 1977, p. 3), At the same time, tobacco company documents also clearly demonstrate that the industry understood that smokers would not achieve the claimed deliveries because of smoker compensation. For example, a 1975 Philip Morris memo noted 'In effect, the Marlboro 85 smokers in this study did not achieve any reduction in smoke intake by smoking a cigarette I Marlboro Lightsj normally considered lower in delivery" tUoodman 1975, p. 3).

In contrast to industry awareness, the various ways that cigarettes were physically mocfified and the nature and iewl of compensation in response to design changes were not well understood by parties outside of the tobacco industry itself. Public health officials had little basis (o anticipate the degree to which manufacturers could design cigarettes to allow smokers to draw more smoke and nicotine from cigarettes than was represented by machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine (NCI 2001: Parascandola 20051.

It was not until the turn of the twenty-first century that it became increasingly clear that no relationship existed between machine-measured tar and nicotine levels and risks for most categories of cigarette-related diseases.

In 1994, an expert committee convened by NCI concluded: "The smoking of cigarettes with lower machine-measured yields has a small effect in reducing the risk of cancer caused by smoking, no effect on the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and an uncertain effect on the risk of pulmonary disease" (NCI 1996. p. vi). Moreover, whereas squamous cell carcinomas had been the predominant form of lung cancer, by the late twentieth century adenocarcinoma of the lung was becoming increasingly common, presumably reflecting deeper Inhalation of smote thai was facilitated by ventilated filters as well as other factors such as changes in agricultural practices, tobacco curing, and cigarette manufacturing processes that could lead to increased concentrations of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (NCI 2001; Stratton et il. 2001} (see Chapter 5, "Cancer"). By 2001, MCI concluded that "measurements of tar and nicotine yields using the PTC method do not offer smokers meaningful information on the amount of tar and nicotine they will receive from a cigarette* (NCI 2001, p. 10). The 2001 review also concluded that the evidence "...does not indicate a benefit to public health from changes in cigarette design and manufacturing wer Hie last fifty years" (NCI 2001, p. 10). Today, there is a scientific consensus that changes in cigarette designs from the 1950s to the 1980$ to reduce machine-measured tar yields

New Cigarette Products

Cigarette smoke contains more than 7.000 chemicals, including at least 69 known carcinogens and many other toxicants Implicated in major diseases (International Agency for Research on Cancer [I ARC I 2004; Borgerding and Klus 2005; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009), and because the potency of toxicants and mechanisms of action differ, reducing concentrations of individual toxicants might have only a negligible effect on disease risk from smoking (Fowlcs and Dybing 2003; Pantow et al, 2007; Burns et al. 2008). Despite these challenges, Brown & Williamson (Acquired by RJ. Reynolds in 2004), Vector Tobacco, and Philip Morris have all developed cigarettes that purport to deliver lower levels of specific toxicants (e.g., carcinogenic nitrosamines) as determined by standard machine-smoking methods. This reduction in toxicant levels has been accomplished by use of new technologies In tobaccocuringand'or by adding carbon or other materials to cigarette Miters (Hoffmann et al. 2001: IARC 2004). However, the extent to which exposure to toxicants is actually reduced in smokers is not known because reduced machine-measured yields of toxicants do not necessarily reflect actual human exposure. A smoker

did not result in decreased morbidity and mortality (NCI 2001; Thun and Burns 2001). In sum, it took decades to recognize that changes to reduce machine-measured tar and nicotine yields in cigarettes did not have a measurable beneficial impact on public health (NCI 2001), In 2008, PTC rescinded its 1966 guidance that generally permitted statements concerning tar and nicotine yield if they were based on the Cambridge filter method (sometimes called the PTC method) (PTC 2008).

Oilier etiauges during the past 50 years have included efforts that potentially have made cigarettes more addicting through the use of flavors, chemical treatments to alter the smell and appearance of cigarette smoke, methods to mask noxious sensory effects, and control of the nicotine dose (see Chapter 4. "Nicotine Addiction: Past and Present"). These approftdws included new types of filters, tobacco blends, and ingredients; cigarette ventilation; control of pit and efforts to reduce various volatile organic compounds in tobacco and smoke. These product modifications have the potential to increase me risk of addktkm by contributing to increased risk of initialing use of the product, increased east of smoke inhalation, decreased noxiousness of the smoke, and possibly increased brain nicotine exposure (WHO 2007: Chapter 4. "Nicotine Addiction: Past and Present").

who switches to a brand with lower machine-measured toxicants may smoke these cigarettes In a more intense fashion or may consume more cigarettes per day than previously. Either change could result in greater human exposure to toxicants and no decrease in risk of disease.

For example, Brown & Williamson introduced Advance as a new cigarette with the claim that levels of tobacco-specific nirrosamines (TSNAs) were 70 percent lower than those in leading "light" brands (Star Scientific 2005). Preliminary laboratory studies of cigarette smokers provide mixed evidence for the possibility that use of this cigarette substitute would result in reduced exposure to tobacco toxicants (Breland et a). 2002,2003). Omni, manufactured by Vector Tobacco, b a conventional cigarette for which the marketers claimed lower levels of carcinogenic porycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines, and catechols (Vector Group 2001). Preliminary studies in which Omni is smoked instead of the smokers' usual brand of cigarettes provide little evidence for reduced exposure to toxicants fH&tsukami et al. 2004b; Hughes ct al 2004).

constituents such as pulegone may also be present at low concentrations. Submlcrogram concentrations of pulegone (0.024 lo 0.29 ug/g) were measured in 12 mentholated brands but were not detected in nonnientholated brands (Stanfill and Ashley 1999). Menthol can be added on the tobacco, the filter, or the /oil pack (Wayne and Connolly 2004). Menthol levels in smoke have ranged between 0.1S and 0.58 mg generated per cigarette for several brands (Cantretl 1990). Unlike most nonmenthofated cigarettes, menthol cigarettes usually contain more flue-cured and less buriey tobacco, along with reconstituted tobacco made without added ammonia.

Although they generally are regarded as safe for use in foods, certain flavor-related chemicals added to cigarettes and found in cigarette smoke (Stanfill and Ashley 1999) have known toxic properties, In an analysis of 12 flavor compounds in tobacco fillers from 68 U.S. cigarette brands, concentrations of compounds were 0.0018 to 43,0 ug/g (Stanfill and Ashley 1999). Also. 62 percent of the 68 brands contained detectable levels of 1 or more of the 12 flavor compounds. Plperonal and myristicin were present at the highest concentrations, Anelhofe, myristicin, and safrole were found in 20 percent or more of the brands; pulegone. plperonal, and methyleugenol were each present in at least 10 percent of the brands, in four brands, safrole. myristicin, and elcmicin were found together, which strongly suggests the presence of flavorings such as nutmeg or mace [Myristka fragram) in the tobacco, Cou-marin is a beiusopyronc compound found in the tobacco of one menthol brand at a concentration of 0.39 ug/g, Pulegone, a monoterpene ketone found in peppermint, was present only in mentholated brands, Tentative Identification of other compounds suggested the use of flavor agents such as cinnamon and ginger (Standi! and Ashley 1999). In addition to tobacco analysis, mainstream smoke particulates from several brands were also analyzed for six flavor compounds: eugenol. isoeugenol, methyleugenol, myristicin, elemidn, and piperonal (Stanfill and Ashley 2000). Levels of these compounds in the smoke from eight U.S, cigarette brands were 0.0066 lo 4.21 Mg generated per cigarette. The measurements suggested that a portion of eugenol and isoeugenol in smoke from some cigarettes could be a by-product of the burning tobacco. Also, when filter ventilation holes in the cigarette were partially or fully blocked, the transfer of these compounds from tobacco filler to mainstream smoke particulates increased twofold to sevenfold

In summary, the impact of flavor-related additives on the toxicity, carcinogenicity, and addictive properties of tobacco products has not been thoroughly studied. In addition to the known harmful properties of these compounds, they may potentiate the effects of other known smoke constituents or alter the way people smoke

cigarettes. These additives may also increase the initiation and continuation of smoking in the population.

Delivery of Chemical Constituents into Tobacco Smoke

Various tobacco types are used in the manufacture of cigarettes and other tobacco products. Lamina from bright, buriey, and oriental tobacco varieties, along with reconstituted tobacco sheet, h the main filler component used In cigarettes (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997), In addition to lamina, cigarette filler often contains puffed or expanded tobacco, tobacco stems, humectants, and various flavor additives (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997; Abdallah 2003a). One tobacco variety such as bright can be used, or several varieties can be mixed together in products with specific tobacco blends. Most commercial cigarettes arc constructed primarily from bright tobacco or from a blend of mainly bright, hurley, and oriental tobaccos, usually referred to as an American blend (Browne 1990). However, a few small geographic areas outside the United States (e.g., Prance) have regional preferences for cigarettes made exclusively from dark, air-cured tobacco (Akehurst 1981; Tso et al. 1982). Each type of tobacco has unique properties that influence packing density (Arrbo et al. 1963), burn rate (Muramatsu 1981), tar and nicotine delivery ((irlest and Guerln 1977), and flavor and aroma (Davis 1976; Bnsell 1976; Leffingwell 1976). Bright tobacco, also known as flue-cured or Virginia tobacco, has lower nitrogen content (Le., less protein) and higher sugar content than do the other varieties. Buriey and Maryland tobaccos are air cured and typically have higher nicotine content but reduced sugar content,

Sakuma and colleagues (1984) measured the smoke components in mainstream and sldestream smoke and found that nitrogen-containing compounds were abundant in smoke from hurley tobacco, whereas the non-nitrogerKontaining compounds were more abundant in smoke from bright and oriental tobaccos. Oriental tobacco is often included in blended varieties because of its unique aromatic properties (Browne 1990). Cigarettes such as light or ultralight varieties that deliver low yields of tar and nicotine by FTC/ISO machine measurement often contain puffed or expanded tobacco lamina with higher "filling power" (Kertsis and Sun 1984: Lewis l*>9t>; Kramer 1991), which lowers the density of the tobacco rod, thus lowering the amount of tobacco in each cigarette. Several types of reconstituted tobacco sheet are also used to manufacture cigarettes (Abdallah 2003b).

Development of reconstituted tobacco was an attempt at lW-percent utilisation of tobacco (Abdallah

$mv*an (knmft Report

2003b). Stems, ribs, and scrap lamina are combined with various binders and other additives to form a "reconsti-tutecT sheet approximating the physical and chemical characteristics of a tobacco leaf (Browne 1990; Biackard 1997: Abdalah 2003b). A common additive in reconstituted tobacco b diammoflkim hydrogen phosphate, which is used as a pectin release agent that facilitates cross* linkage to form stable sheet material (Hind and Seltg-man 196?. 1068: Hind 1968). Reconstituted tobacco sheet containing this additive selectively adsorbs nicotine from surrounding lamina and enriches it in an environment abundant in ammonia precursors (Larson at al. 1980).

The stages of manufacturing a cigarette include processing the tobacco lamina and reconstituted tobacco materials and slicing them into shreds of a specific cut width. Tobacco cut widths vary from approximately L.5 mm for a coarse cut to 0,4 mm for a line cut (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997). Alternatively, the cut width may be expressed in units of cuts per inch, which range from approximately 14 to 48. Cigarettes made from fine-cut tobacco have faster static burn rates resulting in fewer puffs (Resnik et al. 1977), A consequence of using tobacco filler with a fine-cut width is that the ratio of filler surface area to void volume increases and may increase the efficiency of the tobacco column to filter large aerosol particles (Keith and Derrick I960).

The papers used in cigarettes are generally flax or linen fiber and nw contain adcBlives (Browne 1990). Salts often are added to the cigarette paper as optical whiten-era to achieve a target static bum rate and to mask the appearance of sidestream smoke (Schur and Rkkards 19*0; Owens 1978; Dwrocher 1984). A key physical property of the paper wrapper is Its porosity. Papers with high porosity facilitate diffusion of gases in and out of Hie tobacco rod (Newsome and Keith 1965; Owen and Reynolds 1967). Volatile smoke constituents such as CO readily diffuse through a porous wrapper, so delivery to tlie smoker is lower than that with less volatile constituents. High-porosity papers also permit awe 02 to diffuse inward, which increases the static burn rale and Hie airflow through the tobacco column that dilutes the smoke. A faster-burning cigarette yields fewer puffs, reducing Utr and nicotine delivery per cigarette (Durocher 1984). Porosity of the paper, filler cut width, filter efficiency, and tobacco density all make important contributions to reduction of pressure drop in tiie tobacco rod, which Is a key index related to acceptance by smokers (Norman 1999). Smokers prefer a cigarette on which they do not have to draw too hard because of changes in pressure drop as a result of design. A separate but related parameter, filter pressure drop, to directly related to smoke delivery and filter efficiency (Norman 1999).

In 2006. cigarette lengths generally fell into one of four categories in the U.S. market: king-sixe filter cigarettes (79-88 mm; accounting for 62 percent of the market); long (94-101 mm; 34 percent of the market); ultra long (110421 mm: 2 percent of the market); and regular, nonfiltcr cigarettes (68-72 mm; 1 percent of the market) (PTC 2009), The usual diameter of a conventional cigarette is 7.5 to 8.0 mm (Norman 1999), although some "sliim" haw olameters of 5 to 6 mm. The amount of tobacco consumed varies with the circumference of the cigarette, and in cigarettes with smaller circumference, deliver)' af constituents in the smoke to the smoker decreases accordingly (Ohlemiller et at. 1993). The greater surface of the wrapper in long cigarettes increases (he opportunity for gaseous diffusion out of the cigarette, which can (1) reduce delivery of highly volatile constituents of mainstream smoke to the smoker, but increase delivery to (he nonsmokcr and (2) increase the static burn rate as more 02 diffuses inward (Moore and Bock 1968). However, long cigarettes generally facilitate delivery of higher tar and nicotine levels, because more tobacco mass

Before the 1950s, most cigarettes were about 70 mm long and unfiltered (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997). The addition of a filter tip to a cigarette can greatly reduce delivery of many chemical constituents of mainstream smoke as determined by the FTC/JSO machine-smoking method (Fordyce el al. 1961; Williamson et al. 1965). This reduction was attributed to filtering of the smoke particulate and reducing the amount of tobacco in each cigarette. Cost savings arc also achieved because the filter material is less expensive than the tobacco (Browne 1990). Filters provide a firm mouthpiece and permit the smoker to avoid direct contact with (tie tobacco. Cigarettes with modern cellulose-acetate filter tips gained about 96 percent of the market share by the 1970s (Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997). In the United States, cellulose-acetate filter tips are the most popular and can selectively remove certain constituents of the smoke, including phenols and alkylphe-nols (Hoffmann and Wynder 1963; Spears 1963: Raggett and Morie 1973; Morle et al. 1975), TVpicalfy, a bonding agent such as triacetin or glycerol triacetate is used to facilitate filter manufacturing (Browne 1990). The filtration efficiency is proportional to the length, diameter, sise. and number of fiber strands and the packing density of the cigarette (Keith 1975,1978; Eakcr 1990). Flavoring agents or other materials can also be incorporated into the filter design.

Extensive research from the 1960s has examined the use of activated charcoal In the cigarette filter to efficiently remove volatile compounds (Newsome and Keith 1965: Williamson �l at. 1965; Keith el al. 1966). The
