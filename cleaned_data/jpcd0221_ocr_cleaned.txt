Q.  How often do you meet with Dr. Gentry?

A.  You know, fairly regularly.  I mean, I don't have standing meetings with Dr. Gentry, but he's obviously involved in a lot of the decisions that I'm involved with, so I see him fairly regularly, not as often as Danny, but on a pretty regular basis.

Q.  And when you say the decisions that you're involved with, what decisions are you referring to?

A.  Dotted line reporting.

Q.  Dotted line reporting. What is that?

A.   What that means is the person who's in charge of developing products for Santa Fe has basically dotted line reporting to me.  Doesn't officially report to me, but a lot of the work is done at R. J. Reynolds R and D through service level agreements for Santa Fe.

So there's basically a dotted line report to me so we can keep abreast of Santa Fe developments.

Q.   Is that dotted line report a written report?

A.  I don't know what you mean.

Q.  Well, you're calling it a dotted line report, so I'm trying to figure out what this dotted

Is it a written report that's sent to you? A.  I meant report as a direct report, as a

to get work done for Santa Fe under those agreements.

So that's why I say it's a dotted line.

It's not an official reporting to me as a direct

Q. And when you say "Santa Fe products," what are you referring to?

A. Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company, which is a sister company of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, which is part of the overall RAI family of companies.

Q.  And what products does Santa Fe Natural Tobacco Company make?

A.   They make natural American spirit products. Ana so as a result or tms aotxea line reporting, are you � do you oversee the production of the American Spirit cigarette line?

one is what we call an annual incentive bonus for all

salary, depending on the company performance, which is paid out every year.

For my level, the current structure is the annual bonus is 65 percent or 60 percent of your annual salary.  The other bonus is a long-term incentive program, mainly for higher-level folks in the organization, and that is paid out in terms of stock which vests over a three-year period.

At my level, the stock grants are equivalent to � you know, equivalent to my annual salary.

Q.  Okay.  So in addition to the � just so I have this down in numbers, you made salarywise last

A,  Right.  That's correct.

and were you also getting stock?

A.  Yeah, I was, but it was different at that level.  At senior director, the long-term incentive was not as large, and the bonus percentage was not as large � the annual bonus percentage.

And, again, the programs have changed over

14 the years, so it was a little different.  It was the

A.  Again, before I became a vice president? Is that what you're asking me?

Q.  Yes.

A.  You know, again, I don't know.  I'd have to go back and look at those types of records.  I wouldn't want to just guess.  But, I mean, I think it's fair to say that I make a very good salary.  I'm obviously very pleased with my compensation.  You know, I think I work very hard for that and have certainly earned it, but I think I'm definitely fairly compensated.

Again, I can't remember what the program was.  In fact, at merger, we were given what our structure was, and it wasn't the same for everybody.

Now, they've unified � over the course of years, they've unified what the pay structure is for all employees for RAI. You're asking me to go back over ten years and try to figure out what that is.  I just don't, off the top of my head, remember it all.

O X     LXX\ �     xXJnd, XL Xjlj x\�

And can you explain to us why you don't agree with that?

A.  Because I work at the company.  I've looked � I've worked at the company for many years. I have not experienced any of that type of behavior. Who your people are suggesting that we conspired with our competitors, we don't really have much relation with our competitors.

I have read the documents.  I have talked to people who have worked at the company for many years.  I just do not agree with that finding.  I understand that the finding has been made by a jury, but I don't agree with it, and I don't believe that.

So that is the basis of my disagreement

Q.  What does that mean?

A.   Some papers that he wrote actually were in response for classes that he was taking to get an MBA.

Some of those strategic planning memos were not official R. J. Reynolds documents.  They were certainly in our files and in our archives, but, you

Certainly in our response to, you know, FDA

the FDA, we will stamp them "confidential" or "highly confidential." So it's a fairly standard practice.

Q.  Well, the idea that they're stamped "confidential" or "secret" or "highly confidential," that means you don't want your competitors to get their hands on those documents, correct?

THE WITNESS:  No.  It means that you don't want to share with competitors what your � either what certain scientists are thinking or what the company's positions or directives are, so you want to keep things confidential.

I mean, it's a highly competitive

A.   I don't know necessarily what it means.  I can tell you from my understanding of the term "satisfaction" and the way it's been used in the industry is kind of a holistic approach on how the product performs.

So do people like the way the cigarette tastes?  Do they appreciate the physiological benefits that they get from the product? Does it perform well?

That's all, I think, part of smoking satisfaction.

Q.  Have you seen the term "habituation" or "habituated user" used in various documents?

A,  I've certainly seen the term.  I mean, obviously the Surgeon General called smoking a habituating behavior in 1964.

So, yes, I've seen the term, and I think it is used in documents throughout time.

Q.  Can you explain what Claude Teague would have meant when he said, "The habituated user of

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS: Well, I mean, I think if you read that particular Claude Teague document, and you read chapters � I think it's 13 and 14 or 12 and 13 from the '64 Surgeon General's report, you will see a lot of the same type of concepts echoed.

And certainly having looked at that document over a number of years, I tend to believe that Claude Teague is parroting a lot of concepts that came out of the '64 Surgeon

THE WITNESS:  I mean, I don't know what would happen to R. J. Reynolds' stock price.

I mean, I think you can speculate as to what can happen.  Certainly there have been attempts made to remove nicotine from tobacco products.  Those efforts have failed commercially in the marketplace.

But at the same time, there are certainly indications from a clinical perspective that cigarettes without nicotine may provide craving relief even though there is no nicotine there.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I mean, not completely.  I mean, because you can't really completely remove the nicotine.  You've � there have been attempts made and successfully made where nicotine levels are very, very low.

The technical hurdle with regard to doing that is if you're going to extract nicotine from tobacco, you can never just take out just the nicotine.

Now, the best attempt I think that was made at that was using genetically modified tobaccos to make the plant not produce nicotine or at least not produce it at the same kind of levels.

biological pathways in the plant, you're not making all of the other compounds in the plant that you would get from normal-grown tobacco, which means ultimately that the product that you make is not a perfect replication of what is made day-to-day just without the nicotine, and

Q.  Well, in response to my question just a few minutes ago you said that it was done and it wasn't commercially successful?

A.  Sure.  I mean, other companies have done it. we're certainly aware of what happens in the industry, and it's been attempted on a number of different occasions by a variety of other companies, just not Reynolds.

Q.   I see.  Now, when did R. J. Reynolds start

A.   I think some basic fundamental research was begun in the 1980s with regard to nicotine and its effects on the body from a biological perspective.

Those � a lot of those results, of course, were published in a book called The Biology of

5 types of documents.

6          I know in the '80s that there was work

15          In the '70s, what was Claude league's

17      A.  You mean his employment position? I think

18 he was a scientist in the '70s.  I can't remember �

19 you know, I don't know his whole career.  In the

20 early '70s, he was a scientist at Reynolds.

21      Q.  And as a scientist at Reynolds, he, in his

22 papers, recognized the importance of nicotine,

23 correct?

2 You know, having looked at those on a number of

3 occasions, there's no data in any of those papers.

4          They're a memorandum where he's stating

5 what his thoughts are based on his read of things

6 like Surgeon General's reports and other literature.

7 But that's not a scientific study. He's not taking

8 any measurements.  He's not studying any smokers.

9 He's not using any instruments when he writes those

16 talking about.  What I'm saying is he wasn't

17 conducting research on nicotine in 1972.  He wrote a

18 memo based on his read of literature.

A.  A scientist at R. J. Reynolds will have a thought about what types of either a product that he wants to make or � he or she wants to make or has an idea that maybe I can use x, y or z material on a filter to remove or reduce a toxicant.

They would make that suggestion,  j^y would conduct that research.  They would make those products.  They would study the data that comes.  See if their hypothesis pans out.

That's what scientists do at Reynolds or at least that's an example of what scientists do at Reynolds.

A.  Right.

Q.  Please tell me which scientist did that.

A.  I mean* I can give you my own experience. When I was at B&W, I had an idea that one might be able to use buckyballs to remove toxicants in smoke.

So I asked my boss, "Hey, I got an idea to use buckyballs in a filter. Do you mind if I go buy some buckminsterfullerene, " which I did.  I bought it. It showed up in R and D.  I had it put into a filter.  We smoked the cigarettes on the machine, and we analyzed the chemistry with buckyballs in the filters and dosed it out.

It's in my document history.  B&W can probably find it.  You know, it didn't work out that well, but that was an idea.  That is execution of a research project.  That happens all the time at Reynolds and has certainly in my 15 years of experience.

People have ideas about what they think they can do, according to what the strategic intent of the company is, which part of that is trying to reduce the harm associated with smoking.

So part of the harm reduction research is how can we remove toxicants or reduce toxicants in

harm reduction research, going back into the '50s. That type of work has gone on for the last 60 years.

Q.  Explain to me why there would be harm reduction research being done in the '50s if the tobaccos company's position, specifically R. J. Reynolds' position in the '50s, was that there was nothing harmful about smokinq cigarettes?

A.  I don't know that I agree with that.  I think certainly the industry recognized the association.

Certainly the operating premise since the f50s, and you can certainly find it in our documentation, that, you know, even though there is not a firm establishment of a cause and effect relationship, it's probably better if you can remove these types of compounds from the product.  Then that was something that they wanted to accomplish.

And certainly that is what they attempted

'60s was certainly aligned with that premise as well

So that's their basic operating premise. Q.  Okay.  Well, sir, in the '50s, you're certainly aware of the fact that the tobacco companies, through its various organizations, the CTR, the TI, the TIRC, made public statements that there is nothing harmful in tobacco smoke.

You're aware of those public comments, aren't you, sir?

MR. LATHAM;  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know if I agree with that type of wording.

I think what I recall from the Duval County prep is tney would say things that they have not been able to identify a compound at this point that would be considered harmful at the levels that would be necessary to cause harm.

I know they didn't agree that a cause and effect relationship was established in the 1950s, but certainly they understood some of the data � the mouse skin painting results certainly by the mid-'50s were deemed to be real.

They wanted to understand why and how those

What I recall hearing is on a couple of different occasions if something harmful is found in tobacco or in cigarettes, we would remove it.  I remember that.

ujcay.  wen, xi you recaxx r.nar oexng saia, has something been found harmful in tobacco products?

A.   Sure.  Yes.

Q.  Okay. Has that something been removed from tobacco products?

A.   Completely, no.  I don't � I think �

Q.  Well �

A.   I think perhaps that, you know, when those statements were made, I mean, I would certainly cnaracT�en ze cnem as jjeing a dit naive cHjoul tns simplicity of executing that.

But certainly there are toxicants in cigarette smoke and in tobacco.  There are carcinogens found in tobacco and mostly in smoke. And certainly the industry and Reynolds in particular has spent a good deal of time, money and effort trying to remove or reduce those things.

3 bv that* sir?

4      A.  Well, what I mean is it's easy to

5 Monday-morning quarterback.

6          You know, I think I characterized in having

7 read a lot of the documents and seen video, that

8 there was a different attitude about science's

9 ability to solve problems.

10          And I think it was just generally thought

11 that if there was something � it's kind of like

12 everybody kind of thought there was a silver bullet lo   3otenL.iaj.iy in cigarette smoKe, T,nau lr i round, unar,

14 one thing, that we would be successful in executing a

15 plan to remove it.

16          I think that's a little bit of a naive

17 thought, that there's a silver bullet out there.  You

18 know, we know now � I don't think you can sit back

19 and say in the '60s that anybody would have said,

20 n0h, there's 5,000 compounds or 7,000 compounds found

21 in smoke."  They didn't know that then.

22          So I think there's a bit of an

23 underestimation about how easy or how difficult it

24 would be to execute a strategy to remove potentially

25 harmful compounds in cigarette smoke.

all of the carbonyls from the gmoke gtzream.  j

Paqe 58 A.   I think it is currently not possible to make a safe cigarette that burns tobacco.  I don't believe that is possible today.

Q.  And so the only way to eliminate it today would be to eliminate cigarettes, correct, sir?

A.  I don't know that you have to eliminate cigarettes.  I think you can quit.  Don't use them. That's a way to eliminate your risk or certainly severely reduce it.

Q.  I'm talking about from a standpoint of the company that makes the product. As vice president, you're aware that your product kills over 480,000 people a year, correct?

Q.  When did R. J. Reynolds first advise any

smoker that nicotine was an important reason for

smoking?

A.  Look, I don't know all of the history of advertising or communication with smokers, but, I mean, I would certainly say that Reynolds certainly knew that nicotine was important to the smoking experience and certainly sets tobacco apart from a plant family perspective.

But to what extent they may have communicated the importance of nicotine to their products to consumers, you know, I just don't know.

Q.  Well, you said � you mentioned advertising.  Have you reviewed the R. J. Reynolds' advertising throughout history?

A.   No.

Q.  No, you haven't?

A.   I have not, no.

Q.  Okay. Well, you mentioned advertising. That's the only reason I asked about it.

Anywhere in R, J. Reynolds advertising, did they ever advertise that nicotine was why people were smoking?

Q.  Okay. And when did that statement first appear on your website?

A.   I think going back to about 2000.

Q. Okay. Prior to it appearing on your website, did R. J. Reynolds ever make a public statement that nicotine was addictive?

A,  Prior to that, no, I don't think Reynolds would have agreed that it was considered addictive up until the late '90's, early 2000s. That's not what Reynolds' position was.

So certainly scientists at Reynolds know

that literature pretty well. So they are likely

to know more than, say, Ms. Cooper or basically

your average person on the street.

But I think largely directly to its consumers, I think through your advertising and through your packaging is where most of your communication occurs.

Q.  Okay.  So from R. J. Reynolds' perspective, the idea of advertising is a way to communicate with

11 (their customers, correct?

12      A.   I think that's fair to say, yeah.

13      Q.  And the intent on the part of R. J.

14 Revnolds and their advertisino is to reach the

15 public, correct?

16      A.   To communicate with their consumers, yes, I

17 think that's fair to say.

18      Q.  And the intent of R. J. Reynolds in its

19 advertising is to communicate with their consumers

20 and inform the consumers, correct?

22 is to get a smoker to try a Reynolds brand.  I mean,

23 the intent of all of our advertising is around

24 reaching smokers who don't smoke whether that be

25 Camel or Kool or one of our other brands and get them

That's the whole point of the advertising, in

general.

Q.  Well, it's certainly also to get new

smokers, isn't it, sir?

A.  No, I would not agree with that.  That's not what our � necessarily what our strategic intent

We want to communicate with adult tobacco consumers so that they will consider to use our brands.  That is what our intent is.

18      A.   Because a warning went on every single pack

19 of cigarettes that R. J. Reynolds sold, which is a

20 health-related warning.

22 23

24 25

Specific to those diseases, certainly in the 1980s, there is connections to cause of specific diseases, but really I think you can make an argument that since 1966.

Page 72 General's cautionary warning on the packs?

MR, LATHAM:  Objection to form, THE WITNESS:  Correct, which then in 1971 was a Surgeon General's health warning, and then in the '80s, there's the four rotating warnings that occur on cigarettes today, so, yes,

BY MR. HAMMER:

Q.   Okay.  In the 1960s when those warnings

were placed on the packs, was that something R. J.

Reynolds voluntarily did?

A.   I wouldn't say they voluntarily did,  I

think R. J, Reynolds' position in the 1960s was that

a warning wasn't necessary because it was well known

that smoking could be injurious to health.

I mean, I've seen some of the congressional

hearing testimony on that, but that wouldn't have

been � 1 don't think Reynolds necessarily agreed

that it was necessary.

Q.  In fact, R. J. Reynolds' position was that

they did not want to put those warnings on and they

A.  I don't know necessarily about the fight. That was certainly their position, that they were not necessary.

The fact is they did go on, and they have

3      Q.   I understand that, sir.  I'm talking about

4 leading up to it, you said you reviewed the

5 congressional hearings.

6           In those congressional hearings,

7 representatives from R. J. Reynolds appeared for

8 Congress and argued against the necessity of putting

9 those warnings on the pack, didn't they, sir?

10      A.   They did.  They said that they were

11 unnecessary.

14 somebody suggested that you could shout from the

15 rooftops and not tell anybody anything that they

16 didn't already know.

18 [packs, R. J. Reynolds also appeared before Congress

A.  Again, I don't know.  I don't know the basis of that. All I know is that when Reynolds was required to put the four rotating warnings on, after all debate, if there was any debate, was concluded, they did that and have done that.

Q.  R. J. Reynolds continues as we sit here 7 today to contest having to put those on their packs, isn't that true, sir?

MR. laxhaM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  R. J. Reynolds went to court over those graphic warnings and has won. Went to federal court, has won their case, has won their case on appeal, and the FDA is not at this point bringing it any further.

And I think R. J. Reynolds had very good grounds, obviously, to seek relief from the court as is their right to do.  I'm sure you have read Judge Leon's opinion.  I know I have. Mostly Reynolds won those suits based on First Amendment arguments.  You know, my interest in it was around the scientific arguments which were also put on, which the FDA failed to prove that these graphic warnings would do what they were proposed to do, which was to prevent youth smoking, to increase quit

rates, and those kind of things.

And the studies that the FDA did showed that those warnings would provide, in essence, zero benefit, and that was brought up in court. So, in my opinion, I think, the suits were

requirements are placed on an industry, that they should be scientifically based, and the government should have a requirement to prove that the benefit that they hope to derive from them is actually scientifically proven to be derived.

And I don't believe � I think the FDA failed to do that, which is part of the reason I think they lost the case.

that of a nontrained person in a field making comments.

Certainly you're aware that the terms "dependence," "habituation," "addiction" have been used and in differing amounts of favor throughout time.

So what I'm in specific reference to is if you read, say, the '64 Surgeon General's report, they're breaking down what they consider the definition of an addictive drug is versus a drug of habituation.  And they have a set of crj_teria that has to meet a threshold in order for it to be addictive versus habituation.

That's very different than a layperson on the street saying, "Cigarettes are addictive because they're difficult to quit."

So that is my distinction, and I am unaware of a scientist at Reynolds declaring that nicotine and cigarettes or cigarettes themselves are addictive at any time prior to kind of the current time frame. I have not seen that.

0   When vou S3.v "tihs current time f rants " what are you referring to, sir?

So since the time when cigarettes are considered or nicotine was considered to be addictive, which is after the '88 Surgeon General's report, I'm not familiar with any scientist making a statement or a statement with data that would suggest

Q.  Well, you referenced the 1988 Surgeon General's report and, in fact, in that report, the 1988 Surgeon General's report concluded that nicotine is addictive, didn't it, sir?

A.  It did, just like the '64 Surgeon General's report concluded that it was habituating.  So obviously there is a change in the view on how one sets the criteria and how that definition changed between '64 and '88.

Q.  All right. As vice president of R. J. Reynolds, is it your position that R. J. Reynolds accepted the 1988 Surgeon General's opinion that nicotine is addictive?

A.  No, I'm not saying that.  I have not said that.

I mean, they do obviously currently. But at the time, I would not say they accepted that, no.

Reynolds, along with other tobacco companies, appeared before Congress and said that it was not addictive, right?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  The R. J. Reynolds CEO tried to explain that he didn't believe it fit the classical definition, which would have been in reference to the definition used in '64. BY MR. HAMMER:

Q.  Well, explain for us, then, why in 1994 R. J. Reynolds' position was that it should be using a 1964 definition to define "addiction"?

A.  Part of the reason was R. J. Reynolds' scientists did not believe that the science had really moved that much. There was no new scientific work that would suggest that a change in definition was necessary.

Another part of that is the definition or the 1988 Surgeon General's report made the suggestion that nicotine and other compounds that were addictive like nicotine would be equated to serious drugs of abuse like heroin and cocaine, and Reynolds did not agree with that, making that type of link.

I mean, I don't agree with that today.  So that's certainly part of their concern over the

change in the definition.

Q. You said you don't agree with that today. What specifically don't you as vice president of R. J. Reynolds agree with?

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I don't agree that nicotine is the same as heroin or cocaine.  I don't agree that if a person were addicted to cocaine or heroin that trying to quit those drugs of abuse is anything like trying to quit smoking cigarettes.

I don't think your health is endangered. In fact, alcohol could be thrown into the same category.  I don't think I need a medical doctor to monitor me if I'm going to quit smoking cigarettes as you would in the case of heroin or cocaine.

The impairment in using a drug like cocaine or heroin, physiological change is nowhere near that or nicotine.

So I think there are significant airrerences between those, ana I don t agree with � I don't agree with that presumption. BY MR. HAMMER:

Page 89 that is R. J. Reynolds' position?

A.  I think in general, yes. I don't think R. J. Reynolds � I mean, I don't know that we have a stated position necessarily on that, but I think R. J. Reynolds would say that heroin and cocaine are not the same thing as nicotine, and they shouldn't be in the same classification.

Q.  Why is it, then, that R. J, Reynolds, on their website, says to refer to the Surgeon General's report?

A.  Because we believe that consumers should go to the public health authorities to derive their information, and that is the position that Reynolds has taken, that that is the right thing to do, despite what our individual opinions may be as R. J. Reynolds.  That is where consumers should get their health information.

Q.  Now, you justified the fact that R. J. Reynolds' CEO appeared before Congress in 1994, and said that he did not believe that nicotine was

1994 and 1964.

Remember saying that, sir?

Q.  All right.  So between 1964 and 1988, it was R. J. Reynolds � as vice president of R. J. Reynolds today, you're justifying the CEO's appearance before Congress in 1994 as the fact that the definition � I'm sorry, that nothing had changed

Page THE WITNESS;  Well, I think the definition is fairly well accepted.  In other words, I think the criteria that were set in '88 as opposed to, say, in 1994, in 2000 those criteria are generally well accepted.

i rninK, aiso, Lnat cnere s   you Know, there was � obviously the public and others didn't understand what Reynolds1 position was in terms of what we felt about nicotine or its � the difficulty of quitting smoking.  I think it was blown out of proportion in terms of what our actual views were.

So I think a lot of things come into effect in saying that Reynolds accepts the definition as it's commonly used today in terms of what is addictive.  And in that sense, certainly nicotine falls into that category.

A.  I think it would be.  If I was completely against the definition as laid out in '88, then it wouldn't be.

But I think in general that myself and Reynolds certainly agrees with parts of the definition laid out in '88 and certainly agree with even the '64 definition, so personally I would say that would be wrong to say that it's not addictive. I don't agree with that myself.

A.  Well, I mean, I think we talk about those issues on our website.  We donft address that in our advertising. I mean, that's not the point of advertising.

If you want to go and talk about or read about issues related to tobacco smoking and health or marketing, then you need to go to the company website. That's not the point of advertising.  The point of advertising is to advertise the brand that you would like consumers to try.

Q   Answer mv Question. Do vou understand mv question?

A.  I do. The only understanding of the age of smokers, our only communication with smokers is with adults ages 21 and older.  So we do not communicate with people younger than that.

Am I aware that younger people than age 21 smoke? Yes.  Obviously/ I am.  I read the literature and I understand it, but that is not who we communicate to.

Q. In fact, you're aware that the literature says that 90 percent of smokers begin under the age of 18?

A.  I have seen literature that says less than 90.  I've seen literature that says 75.  I've seen literature that says 90, 95.  I've seen literature that certainly suggests that a large percentage start before the age of 18.

but we don't talk to anybody that's younger than 21. What are we doing specifically? A number of things.

We support and actually advocate legislatures to pass laws to have possession � tobacco possession laws enforced amongst teenagers, which not all states have possession laws.  We certainly support the idea of adults only using tobacco and only being sold to adults.

So we support the We Card program, for instance, which helps educate retailers on how to check ID and only sell to adults and how to verify that.

We certainly have a program called Right Decisions Right Now, which we have developed since about 1991, which is partially a youth smoking orevention uroGram* but reallv a risk�based decision program that we offer up.

We've helped provide those materials to scnoolSf certainly the Boy Scouts nave signed up tor it, Big Brothers Big Sisters, a number of organizations utilize those materials to help prevent

In addition, we comply with all marketing restrictions in terms of our advertising to minimize the impact of advertising to youth.

do any magazine aQ.verL.isem.enrs rnar we pur forth, the readership has to be verified through a third party that Reynolds uses.  I believe it's Nielsen, if I'm not mistaken, to determine that the readership of that particular magazine that we're going to advertise in is over 85 percent adult readership.

So we do a number of things to try to prevent youth access and sale of youth tobacco products.  We don't want youth to use the products. We don't believe it's the right thing to do, and it is not � it is not good for our business to have that happen.

Q.  So do you agree that it would be a bad idea to target teenagers to begin smoking?

A.  I would, yes.

11 does R. J. Reynolds agree that informing the public

15          MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

16          THE WITNESS:  I don't know that I can agree

17      with that or not.  I think the company's

18      obligation and what the company should do is if

19      it's going to express their opinion or view, is

20      that view should be generally held and based in

21      the science as they view it.

11          THE WITNESS:  Yeah, I think that would be

15      believed and the science suggested to them that

16      cause and effect had not been established, and I

17      think they made that known. And I think they

18      pointed that out because they generally believed

19      that.  And they believed it was important.

20          So I think the company acted in the right

21      way by when � when the opportunity arose or

22      when asked, that was their position, and they

23      stated those positions.

A.  No.  What documents are you talking about? I would like to see what ones you would suggest say that Reynolds1 scientists believed that smoking caused disease in the 1980s.

I think the 1980s and certainly in the late 1980s, R. J. Reynolds would have recognized that smoking was a risk factor, but that was not their position, and that was not the position of their scientists.

So I don't know what documents you're rexerrmg r,o wnen you majce nnaii. assertion,  x wouxo. need to look at those and review them because I don't know what those are.

A. American Cancer Institute � American Cancer Society, yes, a variety of public health groups�

of R. J. Reynolds in this case. Don't you think it's inqportant to familiarize yourself with a publication such as the Surgeon General's report 2014 that just came out?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I think in general it is, out, �  mean, as you said, it just came out.  Is it as important as some of my other day-to-day duties? No, not really. But will I read it? Yes, I will.  Will I familiarize myself with it? Yes, I will.  I just haven't done it yet. BY MR. HAMMER:

1 the public to consider the conclusions of the Surgeon

2 General and the Centers For Disease Control and World

3 Health Organization, it's fair to say that R. J.

4 Reynolds is doing that because R. J. Reynolds

5 considers them to be reliable information for the

6 public to know, correct?

7      A.  I think certainly it's reliable information

8 for the public to consider and which is why we direct

9 them to those links on our website.

10      Q.  Does R. J. Reynolds agree with those

11 various publications, the Surgeon General's report,

13          MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.

14          THE WITNESS:  Well, I think it depends on

15      what topic and what the assertions are.  I mean,

16      obviously Reynolds isn't going to necessarily

17      agree with everything that any scientific body

18      is going to conclude.

19      We think it's rational and the right thing to do

20      for consumers to derive that information from

21      public health authorities.  That is the

22      direction we have chosen to go, and that is what

23      we maintain on our website.

24      Our opinions or our conclusions I don't think

25      are as irrelevant from a public perspective as

Q.  So as the representative of R. J. Reynolds, does R. J. Reynolds as a whole disagree with some of the opinions of the Surgeon General's report, or is that just your opinion?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I mean, again, we don't have � we don't have necessarily company policies on any one particular issue, but I tfixnJc it s rair to say tnat the company would. not necessarily agree with everything the Surgeon General says. [BY MR. HAMMER:

15      A.  Well, I mean, on the website, if you go to

18 that we reserve our right to have our own opinions or

19 something along those � we may not necessarily agree

20 with everything written on the links provided kind of

Q.  Now if h� would testifv foefoir� Conoress that nicotine is addictive, then why not put that on the individual packaces of vour product?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS: You know, I don't know. I haven't really considered � why would that be important when it's obviously known? It's certainly on our website.  It's certainly talked about.  It's on -- it's on other products that we make.

It's on our Snus products.  It's on the VUSE product, the e-cigarette product.  I think people already know that nicotine is addictive and nicotine in tobacco products is addictive. We're directed by the government to put specific warnings on, and we will continue to do that.

MS. SPEAR:  Hello, is anyone on?

20      I know there's unintended consequences for the

22      saw in that lawsuit that Judge Leon put forth in

Q.  Well, I find it interesting that you've read Judge Leon's full opinion with regard to the FDA warnings, but you have not � you've indicated you have not read the Engle opinion in full despite the fact that you're testifying in an Engle case, and you've not read the full Ressler opinion, which also went against you. Why is that?

Page 126 MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I mean, I think I'm fairly well versed on the issues that surround Engle and surrounded the DOJ case. That is what I'm an expert witness at. What I was not an expert at is really understanding the basis by which Judge Leon was rendering his opinions on a specific statutory requirement that was written in the law.  So thatfs why I read that opinion. I'm certainly aware of the issues that were argued in Engle and argued in DOJ.  In fact, I testify about them quite frequently.

1      Q.   I'm sorry, page four.  It's got number four

2 on top.  And in the second paragraph, it starts out,

3 "Before proceeding too far in the direction of design

4 of dosage forms for nicotine, it may be well to

5 consider another aspect of our business, that is the

6 factors which induce a presmoker or nonsmoker to

7 [become a habituated smoker."

9   understanding that R. J. Reynolds only advertises its

10 product to get the current smoker, right?

11      A.  Correct.

12      Q.  What does the term "presmoker" or

13 "nonsmoker11 mean to you?

14          MR. LATHAM: Before he answers, I just want

15      to make a note for the record that the document

16      you've handed him has been altered by someone

17      other than someone at Reynolds and has

18      handwritten notes and marginalia on the

19      documents that were added by someone other than

20      Reynolds.

21      So I don't want the record to be unclear, that

22      the copy as printed and as marked at the

23      deposition is not a complete Reynolds document.

24      With that, he can answer the question.

q^       sir, what does the word �� the terms "presmoker" or "nonsmoker" mean to you? Can you

document I guess is presumed that somebody who is going to eventually be a smoker.

Teague worked for R. J. Reynolds, correct?

A.   Yes.

\i *       /uiu as it stajios, a& least in uis  / us, as of April of 1972 when he signed off on this document, R. J. Reynolds was looking to induce a presmoker or

15 nonsmoker to become a habituated smoker, weren't

A.  I would say that. I would say so because, I think during the time frame that this was written, certainly marketing policies � certainly if a presmoker is a youth, then that certainly would be against company policy because that was not � company policy at RJR is not to market to youth. So that's what � I mean, he goes later on to say that you should never try to induce a nonsmoker written in this � I believe it's in this particular document. But I think he's talking about presmokers are people

19 who are going to be smokers. Now, how you're

supposed to know who those people are off the top of your head, until they become a smoker, I'm not exactly sure.

Q.  Sir, those are kids, aren't they? Isn't

So he recognizes that your opportunity to speak to the presmoker are limited, but also recognizes that it's important to get that presmoker to start smoking, right?

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.

Hon ' t" know thrit hp' s talking about the level of importance of it or not.

I mean, I don't see him � he's talking about what he thinks � in my opinion, he's talking about what he thinks should, be done, that we don't talk about nicotine in our advertisements or in our communications with the public, and that we should, and that there's satisfactions to be gained.

I don't necessarily agree with that.  I don't think the company went out and did that.  So

my r�3d of the document  this is "his otuinion

piece on what should be done. BY MR. HAMMER:

Q.   Okay.  Well, let's go, then, to his next document, the February 2nd, 1973 document.  And that's entitled "Some thoughts about the new brand of cigarette for the youth market."

1 What is the youth market in RJR's terms?

Page 141

2      A.  Well, I think he says it in the first

3 sentence.  I mean, he says, "At the outset, it should *�   oe saio. rnau we are presently ano. i oeiieve

5 unfairly" � so that's his opinion � "constrained

6 from directly promoting cigarettes to the youth

7 market, that is to those in the approximately

8 21-year-old and younger group."

9 So basically he's saying adults that are, you know,

10 18 to 21.  So he thinks we're constrained.

11      Q.  Well, show me where it says 18 to 21 in

12 this document, please.

13      A.  Well, it doesn't.  It says 21 and under.

14 So he thinks that we are unfairly constrained in

15 marketing to people under 21, which means that, of

16 course, that is what the company is doing, is l i   marjceting to tnose wno are �&i years ano, oicier,

18 wouldnft it? That is the first sentence of the

20      Q.  Why � let's go on to the second page where

21 he talks about in the second paragraph, it says, "For

23 that are not smokers yet, right?

14 "If the majority of one's closest associates smokes

15 cigarettes, then there is strong psychological

17 identify with the group, follow the crowd and avoid

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  Look, I don't know that he's saying anything that hasn't been said both in the literature and by the Surgeon General. I mean, is this somehow � I mean, again, I think Claude Teague parrots a lot of what he reads, certainly the concept around peer pressure and thinking that young people are influenced by their peers.

I don't think it's a very new or revolutionary concept in 1973.  I mean, I think he's almost stating the obvious there.

Again, this is not a research document.  This is an opinion document.  As I stated to you earlier around these documents, there's not one single bit of data that is analyzed or looked at in any of these papers, which makes them basically opinion pieces that he decided to write for whatever reason.

4 And, again, when he uses the word "youth," what is he

5 referring to?

6      A.  Well, I think he says in the first

7 paragraph under 21.

8      Q.  Okay. Then let's go down to the next

9 paragraph where he says, "A careful study of the

10 current youth jargon together with the review of

11 currently used high school American history books and

12 like sources for valued things might be a good start

13 for finding a good brand name and image theme."

14 So why refer to high school history books?

15      A.  Well, apparently he thinks it's a good idea

16 that that is what should be done, but I don't see any

17 evidence that anybody ever did that nor do I think

18 he's really even current in 1973 with the quote,

19 unquote "youth jargon" by in the second sentence of

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't agree with that.  I mean, are you suggesting that the Joe Camel campaign is an outflow of Claude Teague some almost 15, 20 years almost earlier? BY MR. HAMMER:

Q.  Well, sir �

A.   I find that to be a pretty big stretch, if I might be frank. I mean, that's unusual.

QOkay. Well, you said that there's nothing mm                                                          r           urn                                                                                                                                                                                                                  wr

Teague wrote. We never took any action. We never

wanted to target new smokers or youth smoking or

kids, and you asked me to point something out to you,

and X'm pointing out the Joe Camel campaign.

That was a cartoon campaign directed at kids, wasn't

it?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I suppose kids can read anything if they can read, but, again, we abide by the restrictions that we agreed to, which is verifying that the readership is 85 percent or greater adult readership.

Are you saying that it's not? Is that what you're suggesting? I mean, I don't quite understand your questions. We have marketing restrictions that we try to abide by, and to my understanding, we abide by them.

BY MR. HAMMER:

Q.  Sir, that's not even my question.  Okay.

p*V Question was simple.

1      A.  They may. Probably.  I guess so.  I don't

2 know. But 85 percent adult readership is what's

3 required to advertise. We don't advertise in kids'

its cigarette brand in magazines since 2007, isn't that true, sir?

A.  We hadn't advertised cigarettes in a few

19 years in magazines.  That's true.

q   p^^ that was because RJR suspended its ad

21 campaign because they were facing both public and

congressional criticism for engaging in marketing that taraeted kids.  Isn't that true, sir?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  No, I don't agree with that.

BY MR. HAMMER:

Q.  Sir, in 1998, the tobacco master settlement

Reynolds Tobacco Company that you were precluded from taking any action that "directly or indirectly to target youth in their advertising, promotion or marketing of tobacco products." Isn't that true, sir?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Yes, and part of that is the age verification of the magazines that we would choose to advertise in, which is what I was talking to you about before. That was part of that agreement. |BY MR. HAMMER:

shows, it was appealing to teen girls, that's why

5 was called out on isn't that true six'

6      A.   No, the reason why there's no marketing

7 support of Camel No. 9 is because nobody's buying it.

8 It doesn't have much of a market share.  It was not a

9 successful launch � as successful as we had hoped,

10 and its share is very low.  So we can't afford to

11 support every brand that we necessarily have out

12 there with strong marketing.

13 So I would argue that the brand is not selling, which

14 is why it doesn't have much marketing support right

Q.  I'm talking about an internal R. J. Reynolds document.

A.  Well, the only one I remember talking about 14 to 24-year-olds was the last time � I think it was in the Crawford case where it was an obvious typo.

I can't remember the project name, but they showed me that in court, and it was obviously a typo because there was about a half a dozen internal documents dated about the same time by the same author for the same project that said 18 to 24, and one that you all showed us ~ showed me that was 14 to 24. So I'm familiar with that document.  If that's the document you're talking about, then I know that to be a typo for sure.

Q.  Well, I think we sent you some pages from the Surgeon General's report.  Do you have those with you?

A.  I don't know.

MR. LATHAM:  We've got the FDA menthol

A.  I remember making that assertion, yes, and that is true.

I mean, but what you're talking about here is you would be talking about the proportion of the people surveyed is higher for menthol use than it would be in 2004 by a fraction of a percent. I'm not arguing with those statistics. I was simply saying that menthol is more popular amongst smokers today than it was � than really it's ever been.

Q.  And the next paragraph � and the next sentence in that "DaraoraDh talks about a survev finding that the use of menthol cigarettes among young smokers age 18 to 25 increased significantly from 13*4 to 15.9 percent and remained stable among smojcers age J.& to j� i  years. You see where I'm referring, sir?

A.       Yeah, I do, but, I mean, just in the previous � I mean, but you just said in the previous sentence that it had increased among that same age group, you know, from the report in 2011 from 7.7 to 8.2 and then another survey found that it's been stable amongst 12 to 17.

So it seems a little bit contradictory within the same paragraph, right?  I mean, unless I'm reading it

this is what I read to you earlier:  "In the same year, RJR was speculating about a product that could target competitor brands," and it goes on to read, "One suggestion included an apple wine cigarette, an idea attributed to growing popularity of fruit wines among young adults age 18 to 25." And it also talks about � and this is where we had the discussion where you weren't sure of whether it was a misprint, but it says that "it exhibited excepbxonax strengT�n in x.ne unoer �?�? age group, especially in the 14 to 20 group."

A.  Right.

Q.  And that cites a Bates number, correct?

A.  xhat is. And the document that they're referencing, if it's Ritchey 1972, I don't know that I've seen that one. So that wouldn't have been the document I was talking about earlier. I don't know that Ritchey document from '72.  The one I was talking about was a later one that came up in trial.

"Even after tobacco manufacturers agree as part of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement to discontinue any marketing r.nar. mignt appeax to aaoiescents, kuk introduced a new line of Camel cigarettes, promoting unioue flavors.

while you were still with Brown & Williamson in 2003, they introduced Kool Smooth Fusions, which included flavored cigarettes such as Midnight Berry and Mocha Taboo.

And then in 2004 when RJR and B&W merged, Reynolds brought all of those flavored brands under one single manufacturer right? You're familiar with that concept, correct, sir?

adult consumers suggested that they wanted, were not. They were only occasional-use products and they ultimately were not very popular.

This is not an unusual thing amongst adults, to want to have highly flavored products.  I mean, go to your liquor store. You can get vodka that tastes like cake.  Does that mean that the makers of vodka are trying to target teenagers?

I think that's an adult product. Adults like highly flavored products just like anybody else.  So it's not unusual, but the brands were not popular.  They did not sell and people did not repeat buy those products, so they were certainly dropped.

It could be a function of both.  I mean, at the end of the day, you've put out 26 brands that you thought were going to be very successful in the marketplace. They are not.

And if the Surgeon General of the state complained about it, there's yet another reason to drop them. It costs money to try to put products out of the marketplace, and if they don't sell, that's not good business.

I'm not aware that that was necessarily the only reason why we dropped those products. We dropped those products because they weren't selling. I mean, in a similar vein, the FDA in 2009 in the statute banned characterizing flavors, which they

For Tobacco-Free Kids statement. And my answer was I don't think that that was the whole story. And because I know that those cigarettes were not doing well on the marketplace, that that was probably a much bigger reason why we stopped selling them.

Q. And it just so happened that all 28 kinds of flavored cigarettes, RJR decided to stop selling all at one time?

A.  The whole category didn't do well.  All of the highly flavored cigarette category did not do well.  No matter which � and they all didn't come all off at the same time, by the way.  A lot of those brands came in and came out of the market.  Some of them were off in '04, some of them came off in '03. So if you mean to suggest that all 28 came out at the same time, that is actually not true.

It says, "As part of a settlement with the state attorney generals, because it was a violation of the MSA." That's what the Surgeon GSeneral states. Isn't that true, sir?

A.  Right. But I was going to the next sentence which said something different. Okay. I see where you read that. Yes, that's what's written there.  That is correct.

Q.  And so despite what the Surgeon General's report says in their 2012 findings, you would tell this jury that RJR does not market to kids and did not market to kids with their flavored cigarettes?

A.  That's correct.  That's what I would say. Because it doesn't conclude that.  It says, "It most likely allowed" � I mean, they're speculating.  Read the sentence.  "It mostly likely allowed the manufacturer to make the brand itself more attractive to starter smokers."  It's a speculation.  It's not a conclusion.

We don't have any control over what's in movies in terms of tobacco use.  I mean, I guess what Howard Koh is suggesting is that you should continue to denormalize smoking or maybe ban the product. I don't know what other conclusion one can draw from that.

	A.  I don't know that I've seen that particular

2
	clip. Are you asking me whether or not I'm aware of

3
	product placement in movies?

4
	Q.      Sure. Are you aware of product placement

5
	in movies?

6
	A.  I believe it was a past practice. But I


	think, if I'm not mistaken, the last product

8
	placement of any tobacco product that I'm aware of

9
	occurred sometime in the early 1980s.

10
	So for about 30-odd years, that has not been the

11
	case. And I think you're talking about a message

12
	that was written in the 2012 Surgeon General's

13

17
	A.   That's correct.

19
	A.  That's correct.  For about the last          [

20
	30 years, there has been no control over what's in

21
	movies in terms of tobacco use.  That would be my      \

22
	position.

23
	Q.   Sir, when you make a statement, though,

24
	that "We don't have control over what's in movies,"

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I don't know about control,

per se,'but I think there may have been product

placement just like you see � perhaps you see

Pepsi or whatnot in movies.

That is not a practice that we are involved in

anymore. And to what extent we were involved in

that, I'm not that sure other than I'm pretty

So it was given out to adults, not children. BY MR. HAMMER:

Q. If that's, in fact, what occurred, why is it that R. J. Reynolds stopped handing those things out?

A.  Because the � because the brand was not

marJcet snare, it s an unsuccessful Dranct launcn. You donft continue to promote and have launch parties when you1re not launching the product anymore.  I mean, this was all around launch parties, celebrating the fact that a new brand was in market. You don't have a launch party after the product has been launched, nor do you continue to promote it when nobody really wants it.

A.  Well, I mean, according to the statistics, I would think probably so.

I mean, I think if you believe the public health statistics that most people start smoking when they're young, then that would be the case.

Q. And of the millions of those teenagers that started smoking, they became addicted to the nicotine in those cigarettes, didn't they?

A.   Based on the current definition, you would have to presume that would be the case.  I mean, you would have to presume that people were addicted in the '60s.  If you use the same definition today and apply that backwards in time, then the same premise would hold.

The product isn't different, necessarily.  The nicotine in cigarettes is not any different.  So it

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't think I would agree with that, no.  I think people make the choice to smoke.

Even if people are addicted, that does not mean that they cannot quit smoking because obviously there have been � as you said, there are millions of smokers. There are millions of people who have quit smoking � literally millions of people.  There are more people who .have quit smoking today than there are smokers today.

who quit smoking, many of those were addicted. So they have an opportunity to quit, and people can and do quit.

Q.  You said that people have a choice to start smoking. Do people � do people choose to become addicted?

A.   I don't know the � I don't know the basis by which people become addicted.  I think whether you're addicted or not does not stop the ability for people to quit.

Q.   Sir, I'm not Questioning that. |My question is do people choose to become addicts?

14      don't believe I could.

15      It's a product that they chose to use.  The

16      risks were known.  So I don't think I would.  I

17      mean, I feel bad that our product is dangerous.

18      I do.  I feel bad that we can't make it less

21      carries risk.

22 BY MR. HAMMER:

So I don't agree that you can't quit smoking.  I don't agree with that.

Surgeon General has compared smoking � the addiction of smoking to an addiction to heroin or cocaine. You remember you raised some concern earlier today about that ?

there are heroin addicts that have tried to quit but

So we have made and put products on the market that are smokeless products, which would keep people from smoking, which is a lot less dangerous than smoking cigarettes, as well as put out nicotine replacement therapy products to help people to quit smoking. So that's where we would be today, and that is our migration strategy at R. J. Reynolds. Very shortly spoken, but in general that is it.

Q.   And you used the term "migration"?

A.   Correct.

Q.  Okay.  Tell us, please, what relationship R. J. Reynolds has established with smoking clinics. Bow many smoking clinics or smoking cessation clinics has R. J. Reynolds set up throughout the country?

A.   I don't believe we've set up any smoking clinics.  I don't know that �

smokers who are dying from their product � don't you think that would be a responsible thing to do?

A.  Well, I think there's over -- I think there's around 40 million smokers.  So there would be more than 40 million people had quit smoking cigarettes.

Q.  Okay.  Of those 40 million people � I mean, if you're going to use those statistics, have you looked into the statistics to see how many of those were daily smokers?

A.   I mean, I haven't really, but, I mean, it's the same as looking at the Surgeon General's report stuff that we looked at before.  I mean, they*re using statistics to talk about youth smoking.

So if you're going to use the statistics, you know, we need to just, I think, apply them.  I mean, I didn't question whether or not this was right, wrong or indifferent, even though we didn't read that, considering the adolescents � you had to smoke one cigarette in 30 days, they still called that adolescent a smoker.

I mean, I think the same goes for quitting.  Have I dived into those statistics?  I have not.  But a lot of people have quit smoking.  A lot of people are former smokers.

q   so in answer to my question, as far as whether you know how many of those were daily smokers, you do not know, do you, sir? You've never looked at those statistics.  Is that the answer?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Yeah, their position was that a cause and effect relationship had not been established, mainly because the '64 Surgeon General's report kind of reset the boundaries on how cause and effect relationships can be established. And so the tobacco companies did not agree in

oinierence. BY MR. HAMMER:

Q.  Well, let �

A.  I'm sorry. I'm not done with my answer. They felt that a cause and effect relationship had not been established. The Claude Teague document certainly reviewed information going back to, like, 1910, which there were animal studies involved in

L#lloLL� C*O W\�J�.L �

But there were still definitive missing pieces that would have traditionally been considered. You couldn't establish � despite the fact there were mouse skin painting studies, you couldn't generate lung cancer in any animal through smoking.  I mean, we still can't do that really today either.  But that would have been an important point of consideration. No one can say what the causative agents were in tobacco or tobacco smoke that would link that to the disease, which was important prior to '64. And there was no mechanistic understanding of how the disease propagated, which there is hardly any � there is some mechanistic understanding today, but certainly back in the '50s, '60s, '70s and '80s there were not.

Q.  So based on what you're telling me today, it sounds like you, on behalf of R. J. Reynolds, are

still saying there is no causal link to cigarette smoking and cancer?

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.

VIDEOGRAPHER:  Video number five.  We're on

A.   In general, that would be correct. Q.  Okay. And I'd like to now mark as the next exhibit I think you've got there is an R. J. Reynolds list of ingredients.  Should be, I think, about six pages long.  Do you have that, sir? A.   I do.

MR. LATHAM:  The one that's 2010 on the top?  It says R. J. Reynolds List of Ingredients (2010.)  That's the one that I have.

MR. HAMMER: Okay.  I guess that one will do.  la like to nave that marked as an exhibit to the deposition.

(EXHIBIT NO. 12 MARKED FOR IDENTIFICATION.) MR. LATHAM:  It's number 12. MR, HAMMER:  Thank you.

Q.  Sir, if you take a look at this list, this

2
	We make products without any additives. They're no

3
	harder to ingest than one that does contain

4
	additives.  Winston, tor instance, is a no�additive

5
	product,  it s no naraer to ingest or smoKe or innaxe   ;

6
	than Camel, which does contain flavors and additives.

7
	Q.   Hell, when you use the term "no-additive

	additives," we mean there are no additives.  I mean,    s

	the whole portfolio of Santa Fe products is no

15
	Q.  Really?

16
	A.  Yeah, they don't have any additives.  In

17
	fact, they don't have any reconstituted tobaccos.

18
	They don't have expanded tobaccos.  They don't have

19
	any stem.

20
	So Santa Fe products are all-leaf tobacco products

21
	that contain no additives.  They're no harder to

A.  There is a menthol variety, but there's a difference between putting it on the tobacco or putting it in the filter. But otherwise there's no other additives in any of the Santa Fe products.

Q.  Hell, when something is labeled � in fact, the Santa Fe products, I think, also have a label on it that says "organic," don't they?

A. Some are used � some are made � some brands are made with certified organically grown tobacco.  That is correct.

A.  I don't agree with that.  I wouldn't agree

22 Iwith that.  It has not been � I mean, every study

2 it's better for me.

3      Q.   Sir, I'm not talking about what you agree

11 BY MR. HAMMER:

12      Q.  And Santa Fe products, when they advertise

13 that they're organic, that's to capitalize on the

14 public perception that organic is better for you,

16      A.  No, you're wrong.  The reason why Santa Fe

17 has gone to organic is because their company position

18 is that they want to be the most sustainable tobacco

19 company on the globe.

20 And so part of being sustainable is to go by what

21 their company guidelines are, is to try to grow

22 tobacco in the most sustainable earth-friendly way as

23 possible. And they believe that growing tobacco

24 organically under the premises and certification

25 requirements around organic would be the most

15

smoking as opposed to simply promoting their

16 products?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  Again, I don't know,  I'm not in the marketing department, and I don't know that we had put out advertisements informing the dangers of smoking other than every ad that we do take out has the Surgeon General's warning on it in very legible form.

In fact, there's a dictated amount of space that is required in every ad we take out, having that warning on this there.  So in some sense, every ad we put out talks about the dangers of smoking.  So how about every one that we put out

[BY MR. HAMMER:

Q. Is that really R. J. Reynolds' position, that that's how they're advising the public of the dangers of smoking, by virtue of the warning label that they're recxuired to put on their ads? MR. LATHAM: Objection to form, THE WITNESS: I wouldn't say that that's our position, but that is the fact.

Q   Number six, "There is insufficient evidence that product modification strategies to lower admissions of specific toxicants and tobacco smoke reduce risk for the maior adverse health outcomes. [Do you agree or disagree?

10      A.   I think in general I agree.  We have

11 attempted to reduce the risk, but it has not worked

12 out as we had hoped.

13      Q.   In fact, if you go down to the next set of

14 conclusions, the chapter conclusions, "The evidence

15 indicates the change in cigarette designs over the

16 last five decades, including filter, low tar and

17 light variations have not reduced overall disease

20 Do you agree with that?

l     A.  No, not completely.  1 agree that it has

22 not reduced the overall disease risk, although

23 certainly some lung cancer risk has decreased because

24 of those.  I don't know that it's hindered prevention

1      Q.  And the Surgeon General's conclusion number

2 two there, "There is insufficient evidence to

�j   determine whether novel tobacco products reduce

4 individual and population health risks."

5 And you know what they mean by "novel tobacco

6 products," correct, sir?

7      A.   Well, it depends on what products they're

8 talking about.

9 I mean, this is about smoke products, so in general,

10 smoke products I would agree with.  There may not be

11 enough evidence to definitively prove that.  So a

12 product like Eclipse, for instance, may not have all

13 of the evidence required to establish that. But I

14 would disagree if they're talking about a smokeless

4      Q.  Let's turn to page 15 there in your packet.

5 And in the Surgeon General's report it indicates

7 under where it says, "Cigarette design changes over

8 the years." You see what I'm referring to, sir?

9      A.  Yes. What paragraph?

10      Q.  The sentence beginning in that first

11 paragraph that begins, "However."

12      A.  Yep.

13      Q.  It says, "The tobacco industry's internal

15 core concept and function of the cigarette has

16 changed little since its invention in the early part

21

22 but certainly delivered smoke containing nicotine,

23 24

you agree with that?

A.   I mean, I think in general that's correct. It's not just nicotine that's delivered to the user,

certainly.

Q.  And that certainly goes hand in hand with

25 Claude league's position in his paper that says that

A.  Are you saying that � I don't know what you're saying.  Are you saying that the Surgeon General is parroting what Claude Teague said, or the other way around? I'm not sure what you're saying.

Q.  Well, Claude Teague, in his papers, talked about how nicotine is the sine qua non o� the cigarette, without which there would be none. And essentially what the Surgeon General is saying in

delivering nicotine to the user.

A.  Certainly that's part of it.  That's a major part of the smoking experience.  There's no question about that,  I don't know that that's news.

QNow, vou mentioned alternative Droducts. the novel products.  And you're aware that R. J. Reynolds has one of those novel products, correct?

A.   What -- we have lots of what I would consider novel products, I guess.  But what are you in reference to?

Page 279 Q.  Okay. RJR released the Eclipse product in an effort to do what? Tell us about Eclipse.

A.  Eclipse is a product that largely heats tobacco rather than burns it.  It/ through our research, has a much simpler smoke chemistry so the toxicants and carcinogens in its aerosol are largely reduced pretty much across the board, as well as biological information that we derived around it shows that it's potentially lower toxicity may present less risk to the consumer if used or switched to.

secondhand smoke and room over and things like that. But the initial purpose of trying to develop products like Premier and Eclipse is to lower the delivery of carcinogens and toxicants to the smoker.

Q.   Those products were not commercially successful, were they?

A.   Premier certainly was not.  Eclipse has not currently been successful, no.  I would not characterize them as successful.

Q.  Now, you said that � earlier that R. J. Reynolds made a decision to stop production of various lines of cigarettes because they were not commercially successful.  You remember making that

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS: No. And I'm somewhat offended by that suggestion.  No, we believe that Eclipse is a product that I think is probably way ahead of its time. With the advent of E-cigarettes, I think that proves that it was a product way ahead of its time because E-cigarettes, I think, are a natural outflow of what Premier and Eclipse demonstrated could be done.

And we still have Eclipse on the market because there is a small, but dedicated, set of smokers who continue to use it.  And you may not have

There's always the thought that, you know, perhaps the time for Eclipse is coming. Certainly there are other tobacco companies that are talking about and speculating about launching heat not burn products all over the globe.  So I would not � I would not necessarily say that we need to abandon Eclipse at this point in time.

A.  You have, yes.

Q.   And that's a concern raised by the Surgeon General in 2010, correct?

A.  That's what they wrote. It's unusual because they quote this lab stat report from 2000 about the Massachusetts Department of Health. I don't understand why they didn't � and that's not a peer reviewed report.  It's unclear to me why the Surgeon General chose to ignore an actual peer reviewed study on Eclipse that R. J. Reynolds conducted that not only just looked at the chemistry at multiple extreme regimes against the very products that Massachusetts put up against, but also ran biology and showed very favorable results. I don't understand why the Surgeon General of the United States chose to ignore that peer reviewed study.  I don't know understand that. And as it applies to these other statements that are made, I guess this illicit drug business was put out by Henningfield in the '80s around Premier.  That's jnever � those aren't � those are conjectures by Henningfield.  That's not anything that we did or said or even suggested.

3      Q.  And, in fact, there are several more states

4 that are attempting to legalize marijuana for medical

5 purposes and ultimately for recreational purposes,

6 correct? You're aware of that, right, sir?

7      A,  Just as I'm aware that the federal

8 government still considers it to be a felony.

9      Q.  Yeah, and yet the federal government in

10 Colorado has made it clear that they will not be

11 prosecuting anybody for possession of the legal state

12 amounts of marijuana. You're aware of that, aren't

13 you, sir?

14      A.  I'm aware that's what the president had

15 suggested, but I don't know what's going to happen in

16 four years when we have a different president and

17 they change their mind.

18 I mean, my understanding is, according

19 to � it's a federal offense to sell marijuana.

20 That's my understanding. And so we are a company

21 that engages in business across the U.S., so we are

22 not engaged in that business.

A.  No.  I don't understand what you're talking about.  I think people smoke marijuana.  People will

things, but I'm not aware that anybody has made a carbon-based briquette to heat marijuana as opposed to smoking it.

I'm not even sure if the active ingredients or the active compounds in marijuana are liberated at the temperatures that the Eclipse heat source would utilize to liberate glycerin and form an aerosol.  I nave no idea.  x ve never nearo. or seen mar. �

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

Q.  Let's take a look at the next page, page 20, in your packet.  And the summary of that chapter where it says � let's go to the middle of the paragraph that begins, "At the time the adverse effects of smoking were being recognized, the tobacco

machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine, and public health authorities encouraged consumers to select them.

13 Unfortunately, it took public health researchers and

14 federal authorities many years to discover what the

15 tobacco industry knew much earlier. The health

16 benefits of reduction of tar and nicotine intakes

17 were negligible at best for persons using these 13   products."

undermine prevention and cessation efforts." Do you agree with that, sir?

A.  I do not agree with that entirely.  I do agree with certain portions of it.  I don't understand how you can suggest that while we made low machine-yield cigarettes, which as they point out, public health authorities encouraged not only consumers but us to make them, how we could know that they weren't going to be as effective when it takes 20 years or more of epidemiological evidence to suggest ultimately that they were effective or not. I don't know how we would have known that, as this says, "all along" when we were developing them.  That doesn't make any sense to me.  We only know what we know at the time that we know it,

When we made low tar cigarettes and low machine-yield cigarettes, we knew that people didn't smoke like machines, but we believed on average that reducing yield and reducing exposure was probably a good thing to do, just like public health would have felt the same way. bo 1 aon t agree witn ail or tnese statements,  now,

did those efforts reduce the risk burden that everyone had hoped? No, it did not.  It did help, as they pointed out in 20 � 2001, in monograph 13, that there was an effect on lung cancer to some degree, but not � not as large as anybody would have liked. So I don't � I only agree with � I agree with some of it, but I don't agree with all of it, sir.

Q.  Okay. Sir, you said you don't see how they can make such a statement that we would have known back then.

Q.  Have you reviewed the internal documents that surround the time period when you were making these changes, where your own internal documents said that you know that these results are misleading? Save you reviewed those documents, sir?

A.   I have read hundreds of internal documents, and I don't know what you mean by that.  I have read hundreds of internal documents where we participated in NCITWG where we've looked at every technology that we implemented in the cigarettes and tried to look at what those potential health benefits would be, many of which were confirmed by the federal government that they should have an effect. So I'm certainly informed around those internal

But what internal documents are you saying that we have that suggests that lower yielding cigarettes are going to increase or not do anything to the potential disease burden in � for smokers? What internal documents are you referencing? Because I'm unaware of what they are. Maybe you can show them to me.

Q.  Well, I'm referencing the same internal documents that the Surgeon General is referencing in their findings where they say, "Unfortunately it took public health researchers and federal authorities duuiv vears to discover what the tobacco industry knew much earlier."

And the fact is, sir, your own documents show that you knew a lot more than what the public health officials knew.  Isn't that true?

A.   No, that's what you're saying.  You have not shown me a single document � I'm sorry, but you haven't shown me a single document that says anywhere

that lower yielding products aren't going to produce lower yields to the consumers.

I haven't seen any of those documents.  I've been in 23 trials or 24 trials.  I haven't seen any document

s that would suggest that.  I've only seen documents

Page 300 THE WITNESS:  Again, I don't know that I've read the executive summary.  I have read excerpts off of news reports that I presumed to have been the executive summary because that is what I know was released during that time frame. [BY MR. HAMMER:

Q,      We can go back to your earlier comment.s in this deposition where you said that you read the executive summary.

A.  Well, that's what I meant by it, because I remember readinq excerpts from the news.  If I said that � I have not read the executive summary, I don't think.

I've read excerpts from the executive summary during that time frame when it came out in the news, which I think is when the executive summary was released and then the larger report, I believe, was released lauer.

Q.      Well, as a representative of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, don't you think it's important to know what the Surgeon General of the United States has to report on the health consequences of smoking after 50 years.

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form,

We certainly know that cigarette smoking is dangerous and carries with it significant risks# I'm not sure that the Surgeon General is going to change that conclusion, so I don't know that it significantly impacts our R and D efforts.

We want to institute strategies to implement that and affect product changes that could accomplish that. So we're aligned there.

A.  What do you mean?

Q.   In other words, there are no product standards for menthol when used in cigarettes?

A.  Not currently, no.

Q.  Okay. And as the FDA wrote, "Approximately one-fourth of all cigarettes sold in the United

States are menthol," correct?

A.   Approximately.  I'd say about � that's probably about right. About a fourth.

Q.   "And the vast majority, 88 percent of adult smokers in the United States start to smoke before age 18," correct?

A.  Okay.  I mean, it's been quoted a bunch of times, yes. I would say it depends on what number, but a lot of people start before 18, yes.

sentence says, yes.

Q.  And that's essentially why the FDA is concerned about the possible public health effects of menthol versus nonmenthol cigarettes, correct?

A.  Well, that's certainly what the TPSAC was asking or looking into and the FDA asked the TPSAC to look into that, so, yes.

Q.  And, in fact, back in July of 2011, TPSAC voted on its final report and recommendations on menthol, which concluded "Removal of menthol cioarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health An the United States," correct?

A.   That's what they said, yes.

Q.   I mean, you're aware of that report, correct?

A.  We did not do so.  That is correct.

A.   They make that recommendation based on the assumption that if menthol was removed from the market, that every or most menthol smokers would stop using tobacco products.  I don't know that that's going iu nappen.

That's the only way that that's going to work, or that people are not going to figure out how to menthol nonmenthol products on their own, which very well could happen.

So could it affect public health, it could if everybody who smokes menthol products stops smoking.

And in considering that, they reviewed studies, utilizing a variety of measures of nicotine dependence and/or craving, including studying � msasurincf the first time ciciarette� ciorarattas per day, the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence and craving, night walking [sic] to smoke was also included.

Q.   Okay.  And so would you agree that marketing � specifically the tobacco marketing and its use of the television commercials, its use of the radio ads, its use of billboards in the '50s and '60s and '70s played a major role in promoting the cigarette?

A.  I would say yes, probably so.  I don't understand how that has a correlation to the current rise in popularity of menthol in recent times, but, yes, I would say marketing efforts would increase the awareness of the product.  That's certainly what it's intended to do.  So I think in general that is correct.

A.   Well, hold on. Well, I mean, they mention youth in the paragraph, but that's not part of their definitive conclusion. I thought you were reading a definitive conclusion. Their definitive conclusion was, "From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with increased initiation and progression to regular cigarette smoking."

I presume that would include both youth and adults. But that was the conclusion.

Q.  Hell, why don't we read this together, then, because I don't want to mislead you or confuse you xn any way* sxr.

Q.   Is R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company � and not just you, I'm talking about R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company as a whole � aware that the FDA concluded that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with increased initiation?

A.  As written here, yes,

Q.  Did � in response to this report, did R. LJ. Reynolds supply something to contradict that?

Q.  What?

A.  We supplied a set of comments, commenting on the reliance of FDA on certain evidence versus other evidence that was available to them, and we pointed that out in our commentary, which is of course available on the FDA website. So, yeah, I mean, the FDA � you know, like, they had to weigh a lot of information.  They had to make choices about what they were going to put their most reliance on.  I don't know that Reynolds would necessarily agree that they made all the best choices, and that what's we would have pointed out on our comments on a variety of issues throughout this

And, you know, of course those comments are available

I*a1 1   mo   wKjit*   4*Via   r^nnnnonf q   mra

A.   I just did.

Q.  You can't get more specific than that?

A.   I said in summary, in essence, that the FDA made choices about what data they were going to consider to be relevant and which data they were not going to consider or not add as much weight to one study versus another.

We pointed out that the FDA, even though their stated policy in terms of what they were going to rely on would be peer reviewed, large scale studies, oftentimes didn't actually rely on peer reviewed, large scale studies, and instead relied on small, one-off studies that were either regionally based or much smaller in the number of people that were looked

So, again, you know, the comments are available. They were publicly available. So we can certainly go through them if you'd like.  I think it's probably easier to read them than it is for me to just try to pull them out of my memory. But that's certainly what I recall reading, having

Q.  And so as a representative of RJR, you disagree*6 with the findings of the FDA with regard to increased initiation?

A.  I don't know that I necessarily disagree so much as I don't know that the data that was looked at is strong enough from a weight of evidence perspective to render this type of conclusion, if that conclusion at all.

And certainly, if one were to look at other data sets, one would not render that conclusion. So I think it is � I think that is debatable in terms of initiation.

Q.  Are yoti � okay. Are you familiar with the 10K that's filed by Reynolds American?

rely on small scale or experimental studies to render conclusions in certain cases. We certainly pointed those out. We did not necessarily disagree with everything in the menthol report, but there were certain aspects of the report that we did not agree with.

That is the basic gist of the overall comments, although they are obviously more lengthy and in depth arid provide example arcer example aix,er example, supporting what that view is.

A.   You asked me that about ten minutes ago.  I didn't have any role in drafting it.  I read the drafts.

The tone and tenor of our comments to the FDA were

strongly worded. That I have said. We believe that

they did not look at and rely on available data that

would contradict some of the conclusions that they

rendered in their report. And we did, in fact, point

that out.  That is my summary of those comments.

3 had no evidence showing that, that there was a

4 difference between menthol and nonmenthol cioarettes

5 and its effect on the smoker?

6      A.  I think they had plenty of evidence to look

7 over.  I think they relied on certain lines of

8 evidence and didn't rely on other lines of evidence.

9 And I think if they truly took a

10 weight-of-the-evidence approach, as they claimed that

11 they would do, then not all of these conclusions

MR. LATHAM:  I'm going to object to the question.  You know what the SEC rules are with respect to material nonpublic information.  And you're not going to induce this witness to try to disclose any material, nonpublic information that he's not allowed to disclose by his company policy.

f that's what you're trying to do, it s totally improper, and you know it's improper.  He's already told you everything he's going to answer

get himself into any trouble by doing so. So I think that by continuing to go in this line of questioning, inviting the witness to violate federal law, would be wrong, and I think you

Q.  I want to talk to you about Eclipse.  I know we touched upon it briefly.

But with regard to Eclipse, when it first came out, the national marketing campaign for the Eclipse actually made explicit health claims, didn't it, sir?

A.  It did. There were claims associated with Eclipse that was put through a scientific advisory board to see if the data that we had generated substantiated a claim that Eclipse may reduce Certain � unG risjcs or certain diseases.

13      A,  That is not true. That is a comment that

out to suggest the contrary.  So I don't agree.  I think Eclipse definitely presents a possibility that it is a less harmful product.

It certainly provides less exposure to toxicants in humans � tested in humans, which this paper does not address at all. So I don't agree. I don't agree with their conclusions, no, nor have they commented on or evaluated any data that would � that they

wrong.

QWhv is it called a diaital vaoor ciciarette?

A.   It's called a digital vapor cigarette because it talks about the technology that we put in the product.  Specifically, there are two microchips that are in the products, one in the cartridge section and one in the battery section that communicate to one another.

It regulates through pulse with modulation the amounts of current that is applied to the heater on the cartridge to generate a consistent aerosol and a consistent amount of aerosol every time it is puffed on.

In addition, it regulates and keeps track of the amount of time that is utilized on the cartridge such that the cartridge and the battery will stop working once the cartridge has been depleted.

In addition, there is software and code ~

other cartridge can be used with our battery and vice

And so once the cartridge is depleted, it can no lonqer be used and it is completely shut off, and it

A.  December, January time frame. Just recently.

Q.  So as far as VUSE sales for 2013, do you know what they were?

A�   Yes.

Q.  What were they?

A.   In terms of market share in Colorado, VUSE now commands over 60 percent of the E-cigarette sales in that state in that time frame.  So they have increased or basically have � we would have

doing very well.

QAnd whv did R# J � R�vnolds dxcjc CoXoirstdo cis the state to first try it out?

A.   I don't know.  I mean, it was a marketing decision why they decided to go to Colorado.  I don't know the ins and outs of why.  I know there were several states discussed, but why they honed in on Colorado, I don't know.

Q,   is it just coincidental that last year

10
	anything derived from tobacco is considered a tobacco

A.  The FDA said they were going to exert jurisdiction on E-cigarette as a tobacco product. We await deeming regulations. They keep saying they're going to be coming out.  It was supposed to be April of last year, then they moved it to October. They have yet to issue their deeming regulations on E-cigarettes, but we expect that they are going to do that at some point in time as they said they were going to do.

Q.  Is there any tobacco whatsoever in the (VUSE?

A.   The nicotine in the V-liquid is derived from tobacco.  So according to the FDA's definition of a tobacco product, yes.

aerosol. We have done chemistry studies on the aerosol.  We have and are going to be going into clinical studies of the VUSE product this year to try to understand the response to switching from cigarettes to E-cigarettes with smokers, understanding the biomarkers of exposure, et cetera. So we have a number of studies in the works and have looked at the aerosol fairly indepthly, and looked at the chemistry indepthly.

y �  aucl nas your researcn rsveaxsy any carcinogens in the aerosol?

A.  In our aerosol, we can't detect them. We have looked for what the FDA calls the HPAC, harmful and potentially harmful constituents list. When we study the aerosol of VUSE, we can't quantitate any levels of things like BAP or TSNAs, et cetera, in terms of VUSE aerosol. In fact, we even looked at a variety of other products and find if there's any kind of toxicants that you can find in those aerosols, they are drastically reduced virtually at the nondetect level. So they're very, very low even for competitor products, if there at all.

Q.  So is it your testimony that your testing has revealed that in the VUSE, there are no

just our cUrrent methodology � it's below the level of quantitation and below levels of detection. So the methods are not good enough to test them at such low levels.  That doesn't necessarily mean that you won't be able to find a toxicant or a carcinogen in the aerosol, just currently we don't see them because we can't detect them at this point.

A.   That is not my testimony, no.

QOkay.  Then answer my question and tell me what the toxins are in the aerosols � in the aerosol of the VUSE.

A.  We have not been able to quantitate or quantify the levels of toxicants because they � if they are there, they are either below detection or below levels of quantification.

We have looked for the HPAC list of toxicants in our aerosol that the FDA would require us to report on cigarette smoking.  So things like BAP, we would report that they would be at a level, but they are below the level of detection because that's all you can say scientifically.

You can't say that they're not there because you can't quantify them.

Q.  So are they there or aren't they there? MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  It's hard to know if you can't quantify it. They may be. There may be toxicants that are detected, but their levels are so low it's difficult to quantify, so you

Page 385 don't see them and certainly we don't see them

at levels that we could say we detect or can

quantify at this point.

It's not to say � there may still be some

there, but we can't say definitively at this

point that they're there definitively. BY MR. HAMMER:

Q.  And maybe it's late and I'm not really understanding what you're saying, and I apologize if I'm reisetitive on this Question but is there a distinction between being able to quantify it and being able to determine whether or not they're there?

A.   There is.  And we face the challenge on both fronts.  You have levels of detention.  You have levels of quantification, and we find it's difficult to find the toxicants and carcinogens that we would normally look for in smoke with our current methodologies in the VUSK vapor on both level of detection ano levels or quan Linear ion.

So we have that difficulty.  I can't say that they aren't there because I think methods are going to improve, but currently that is the best we can do. That is what I can say.

I can certainly compare and contrast.  Compared to a cigarette, I mean, it's obviously vastly different.

q   Okay.  In the pamphlet that you have that accompanies the VUSE cigarette �* the VUSE digital vapor cigarette, do you explain that to the public, that vou're not sure if there's carcinoorens or toxicants in the vapor or the aerosol?

A.  We do not make any kind of claim or explanation of that, no, we do not.

Q.  Don't you think it's important to be fully honest with the � with your customer � with the consumer, with the public?

A.  Obviously I think that we want to be honest with the consumer, but I think we just spent 15 minutes talking about us being honest about Eclipse, and I don't think that has been viewed very well. So we're not making any health claims with regard to VUSE. We are not making any statements with regard or that could even be construed as being implied as a health claim with regard to VUSE.

If we came out and said, "We don't find any carcinogens in smoke," and then suddenly methods are developed that can see a lot further down than we can see now and somebody can detect them, then I think folks would have a field day with that.

So we're not going to make those statements. When the FDA requires us to report on HPAC data with regard to VUSE, which no doubt they will, we will do our level best to provide that data to tne rDA, wmcn wixj. x)e avaxi.a.Dxe to cne public to see.

Q.  Sir, in 50 years, has R. J. Reynolds removed the carcinogens in tobacco?

A.  All of them, no, but we certainly have reduced the yields of a lot of carcinogens.  So to completely remove them, no, not necessarily, but we cemamxy nave reaucea rnem ana nave aata to prove

THE WITNESS:  You're informing the public about what the research programs actually are at the companies. All of the companies as far as I know, and certainly R. J. Reynolds, had active programs to remove � to try to completely

Page 395 Q.   Has RiXR ever admitted that it marketed its cigarettes to children under 18?

MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form, THE WITNESS:  Not that I'm aware of, no. |BY MR. HAMMER:

Q.  Now, we talked about the fact that over 400 � various 400 � 430, 480,000 people die every year from tobacco-related illnesses. Do you know how many die as a result of smokincr RJR products?

A,  No, I don't know that that's a knowable quantity, really.

Q.  Well, certainly of the 400,000-plus, many of them smoke R. J. Reynolds tobacco products,

A.  I would presume so.  I mean, certainly, looking at the Engle piaintiffs, it seems that almost every plaintiff has smoked a brand from every major company in all of these lawsuits. So it looks like there's not much brand loyalty in that smokers have used all kinds of different brands from all different companies. So I don't know how easy it would be to determine one company from another in terms of how many people have died associated with using a Camel or a Marlboro or Newport.

Q.  Actually, are you talking about the ads specifically for Snus?

A.  There are ads for Snus as well, yes.

Q.  Well, one of the marketing messages that RJR has put out for Snus is that it's something that's convenient and easy to use, correct?

A.   It is.

Q.   Okay.  A tobacco product that's convenient and easy to use when you're not able to smoke, correct?

they're long conference call friendly, they're movie friendly, basically implying that they're �� you could use Snus in places where you couldn't smoke, correct?

A.   That is true.

Q.       In any of the Snus ads, they do not say "Stop smoking cigarettes and switch solely to Snus," do they?

A.  Well, I think in the last campaign last year, I think the New Year's resolution made that suggestion with the Snus advertisements.  So I think in some cases we did do that.

Q.  Actually, even in that campaign it said, 11 If you can't smoke, use Snus," didn't it?

A.  I don't know.  I think we made some statements to say you should switch to Snus.  I may be wrong. Again, I'm not the marketing guy.  If you want to talk about marketing campaigns and marketing advertisements, I only know so much.  I'm not in that department.

Certainly there are witnesses that are prepared that could talk about that, but I'm not that expert.

Summary of Opinions

Dr. Figlar will testify that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with quality scientific staff, engineers, and technical personnel. Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the investigation of cigarettes, cigarette smoke, the identification and quantification of smoke constituents, the reduction of smoke constituents* and the commercialization of cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Figlar will discuss Reynolds* historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

It is Dr. Figlar's opinion that Reynolds has been earnest in responding to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking and has diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields while substantially adding to it via its own scientific research. He will testify regarding Reynolds' R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. Dr. Figlar will discuss Reynolds' efforts to identify, develop and implement cigarette designs which substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized machincsmoking methods. Dr. Figlar will also discuss the many successful cigarette designs and technologies developed by Reynolds' scientists that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.

Dr. Figlar will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of more than 5,000 individual chemical constituents, the vast majority of which are formed naturally as a result of combustion and pyrolysis of the tobacco rod during smoking. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than SO toxicants that have been identified by various governmental and public health entities as carcinogenic. Dr. Figlar will address Reynolds' efforts throughout the decades to implement designs that significantly reduced the yields of carcinogens and toxicants in the smoke of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He wilt discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients and additives used in cigarettes on its website, and to the federal government, as well as the stewardship of those additives and ingredients. He will discuss the statements on smoking and health issues communicated on Reynolds' website.

It is Dr. Figlar's opinion that it has been Reynolds' long-time goal to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents that have been associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify that based on the considerable technical obstacles of this goal, scientists and product developers must simultaneously ensure that technologies are feasible from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint and consumer acceptable when implemented in finished products. He will testify that in his experience, more often than not, problems occur in one or more of these areas and trade-offs between technical success and consumer acceptance must be weighed carefully.   He will testify that over the years, numerous market introductions by

-5-
pgNbr=470
Reynolds that achieved varying levels of technical success in smoke constituent reduction failed to achieve wide-reaching consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such commercial products, including, but not limited to, carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotuiJzed" or ultra-low nicotine cigarette brands, as well as novel products such as Premier and Eclipse.

Dr. Figlar will testify regarding Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in its cigarettes, as well as its responses to public health concerns. He will testify that Reynolds* efforts to reduce "tarM yields were a guiding principle in the development and execution of product and technologies over the course of many decades.

He may also testify regarding Ihc FTC method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. Dr. Figlar will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, predict smoke intake for any individual smoker. He will discuss the wide recognition in the scientific and public health communities that there is a broad range of smoking behaviors that influence smoke yield and intake. He will note that despite these variations, on average, smokers of low yield cigarettes receive less smoke than those of higher yielding cigarettes. Dr. Figlar wilt testify that Reynolds does not design its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC method,

Dr. Figlar will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: 1) general reduction and 2) selective reduction. He will discuss the design techniques and technological advances used in general reduction by Reynolds and its domestic competitors that reduce the FTC "tar"* and nicotine yields of cigarette smoke to reduce potential exposure to myriad chemical constituents. Hence, general reduction attempts to address risk as a whole, in reference to cigarette smoke, rather than targeting any single smoke component In discussing general reduction, Dr. Figlar will testify that the cigarette design techniques utilized to reduce FTC smoke yield include: filtration, filter ventilation, high/increased porosity cigarette paper(s), cigarette paper burn promoters, expanded tobaccos, reconstituted tobaccos, reduced tobacco weight, cigarette rod length reduction, reduced cigarette density, and reduced rod circumference. Dr. Figlar will testify about the implementation of various general reduction techniques to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in Reynolds' cigarettes, including brand line extensions He will testify that, at all times, the cigarettes manufactured by Reynolds conformed with the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacturing and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at a standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yield.

He may testify regarding the development of specific technological advances used in general reduction, such as expanded tobacco, which was invented by Reynolds and first implemented in the marketplace in the 1960s as a design tool that enabled the development of cigarettes with lower tobacco weight because expanded tobacco reduces rod density. Dr. Figlar will discuss the reductions in FTC "tar" and nicotine yields that accompany expanded tobacco since the amount of tobacco burned is reduced.                                                                                         ^

Dr. Figlar will discuss the ways in which Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies and how these techniques are used in the marketplace today. In support of such testimony, he will cite to examples such as reconstituted tobacco, which was first used commercially by Reynolds and is now utilized by most tobacco companies globally. He will discuss how reconstituted tobacco inclusion reduces both FTC "tar" and nicotine yields and the limits to the amount that can be utilized in cigarette manufacture due to consumer acceptability. In addition to discussing general reduction broadly, he will testify to the incorporation of these techniques oyer time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Figlar will discuss the modifications that Reynolds made to its products in response to greater consumer demand for lower "tar"' products, coupled with government and public health authorities advocating this approach as a means to reduce the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify how the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds and the domestic cigarette manufacturers have substantially lowered the FTC "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will testify that the sales-weighted FTC "tar" and nicotine yields per cigarette have fallen nearly 60% since the 1950's, from approximately 38 mg "tar" and 2.8 mg nicotine per cigarette to approximately 12 milligrams "tar" and 0.9 mg nicotine today. He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing and launching low iltar" and/or ultra low "tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Figlar will also testify that general reduction decreases the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns. With respect to low tar products, he will also be prepared to address such topics as smoker compensation and Reynolds* research in this area.

Dr. Figlar will testify regarding Reynolds' efforts to address the public health concerns of smoking by means of selective reduction. He will explain Reynolds* work in identifying and quantifying the target compounds of interest and consequently developing technologies to expedite specific chemistry reduction and create products that were commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will also discuss the ways in which Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years, including its historic and current efforts, technologies and products, such as carbon filtered cigarettes. Dr. Figlar will testify about Reynolds* commitment to developing technologies and products with the potential to address the risks associated with smoking with the development of "heat-not-burn" products, such as Premier and Eclipse, He may also discuss innovation in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique and products sold by related corporations, including electronic cigarettes (Vuse) and nicotine replacement therapy (Zonnic).

Dr. Figlar will testify that Reynolds cigarettes have been developed and manufactured with recognized state-of-the-art methodologies and practices at all times during the last six decades. He may testify about Reynolds' research efforts on alternative or novel cigarette designs, including attempts to modify 'tar'Ynicotine ratios in response to requests of members of the public health community, including the U.S. Surgeon General. As part of those efforts, he


pgNbr=472
will discuss Reynolds* interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and others. He will also address Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments for the development of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no governmental authority, public health group, academic institution, scientific establishment or private entrepreneur has ever developed any superior alternative cigarette design, even though the subject has been extensively researched for decades.

Dr. Figlar wUl testify about Reynolds' efforts to develop novel products such as Premier and Eclipse, as well as its efforts to develop reduced risk products. He will discuss alternative cigarette designs and the lack of consensus among government, scientific, medical and public health communities as to which test, battery of tests or other evaluation approaches should be used to determine if one cigarette design may present less risk than another. He will testify and describe Reynolds* product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Figlar may also discuss studies in smokers by Reynolds, including yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

Dr. Figlar may testify regarding allegations of nicotine manipulation. He will be prepared to address the topics of smoke pH, "free" nicotine, and the use of ammonia. He will testify that Reynolds has not manipulated nicotine, altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine, or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will opine that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase mainstream smoke pH or "free nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using the FTC method.

Dr. Figlar may testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding Reynolds' cigarette research and design efforts. He may also offer testimony in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Figlar reserves the right to amend this disclosure.

The Court held: "it was proper to allow the jury to make findings in Phase I on Questions 1 (general causation), 2 (addiction of cigarettes), 3 (strict liability), 4(a) (fraud by concealment), 5(a) (civD-conspiracy-conceaknent), 6 (breach of implied warranty), 7 (breach of express warranty), and 8 (negligence). Therefore, these findings in favor of the Engle class can stand." The Court further held that specified liability and general causation findings by the Engle jury did not need to be proved again as they shall be given res judicata effect.

Consequently, the Plaintiff brings this action upon the limited remaining issues in dispute: specific causation, compensatory damages, comparative fault, apportionment of damages, and punitive damages.

2.      This is an action by Plaintiff, Mary Cooper (the "Smoking Plaintiff) brought in accordance with the decision of the Florida Supreme Court in Engk v. Liggett Group, Inc., etaL, 945 So. 2d 1246 (Pla. 2006) (hereafter referred to as "Engle").

3.      At all tunes relevant to this action, Plaintiff Mary Cooper was a citizen and resident of the state of Florida.

4.      The Plaintiff brings a claim for damages exceeding this Court's jurisdictional minimum.

5.      The Florida Supreme Court expressly reserved to class members, including the Plaintiff, the right to bring individual actions against Defendants for smoking-related injuries and damages, including punitive damages.

6.      Defendant Philip Morris - USA, Inc. ("Philip Morris") is a Virginia corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Broward County, and did so during all times relevant to this action.

7.      Defendant Lorillard Tobacco Company (which assumed the assets and liabilities of Lonllard, Inc.) is a Delaware corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Broward County, and did so during all times relevant to this action.

9.      Defendant Liggett Group, LLC (f/k/a Liggett Group, Inc., I/k/a Brooke Group, Ltd., Inc., #k/a Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company) ("Liggett") is a Delaware limited liability company that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Broward County, and It did so during all times relevant to this action. Upon information and belief, one of its members is a Florida citizen making Liggett a Florida citizen for purposes of jurisdiction,

10.    Defendant Vector Group Ltd. Inc. (f/k/a Brooke Group, Ltd., Inc.) ("Vector") is a Delaware corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida and has its principal place of business in Miami, Dade County, Florida, making it a Florida citizen.

11.    Liggett, Brooke Group, Ltd., Inc., ("BGL") and Brooke Group Holding, Inc., ("BGH") were defendants in the Engk class action. The class was estimated to include several hundred thousand class members seeking damages against Defendants, including Liggett and BGL, On July 7, 1999, after a lengthy jury trial in what is known as "Phase I" of the case, the jury found Liggett and BGL liable to the class, exposing them to substantial judgaients for compensatory and punitive damages.

12.    In September and October 1999, Defendants Liggett and BGL undertook a sham reorganization of BGL that involved the creation of several new holding companies, multiple mergers, acquisitions, and the shuffling of BGL's assets, including Liggett, in an attempt to mislead or defraud creditors, including Engle class members and the Plaintiff herein, and/or to improperly divert revenues and assets of Liggett and BGL. This sham reorganization established Vector as the parent of BGH and Liggett (n/k/a Liggett Group, LLC).

13.    These transactions were the product of an actual intent on the part of these

Defendants to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors, in violation of Florida's Uniform Fraudulent

en Transfer Act                                                                                                                               w

14.    In addition to the reorganization and transfer of assets described above, the management, officers, directors, personnel, location of operation, assets, liabilities, business operations, and stockholders of BGL remained the same when the name was changed to Vector; nominal consideration was involved in the reorganization; the vast majority of Liggett's revenues continue to be diverted to Vector to fund Vector's cigarette operations; and Bennett S, LcBow, tlirough Vector, continued after the reorganization to exercise unilateral control over the assets of BGL and BGH (including the asset Liggett), as he had with the predecessor entities.

15.    Vector therefore is the successor to the original cigarette manufacturer, Liggett, which changed its name to Brooke Group Ltd., Inc. ("BGL"). Vector is a successor to BGL as a mere continuation of BGL and Liggett. Vector is a successor to BGL by way of de facto merger with BGL. Vector also is a successor to BGH.

16.    Vector is but Engle Defendant BGL (f/k/a Liggett Group, Inc., f/k/a Liggett & Myers, Inc. f7k/a Liggett & Myers Tobacco Co.) by another name.

17.    Vector exercises such control over Liggett that Liggett is a mere instrumentality and/or alter ego of Vector. Assets and profits of Liggett have been, and continue to be, improperly diverted from Liggett and BGL in an effort to mislead or defraud creditors, and/or hide assets of Liggett and BGL, from creditors, including Plaintiff herein, and for other improper purposes.

18.    Vector exercises such control over Liggett that Liggett is the agent of Vector and manifests no separate corporate interests of its own. Vector acknowledges Liggett as its agent for purposes including, but not limited to, the sale, marketing, and distribution of tobacco

products. Liggett has accepted by act or word to be the agent of Vector and acquiesced in the

en control exercised over it by Vector.  Vector further exercises control over Liggett through the           J|j

formation of Liggett Vector Brands, Inc., a company controlled by Vector, which now has taken over the sales and marketing of both Vector Tobacco, Inc., and Liggett.

19.    Joinder of Vector as a party defendant is not "fraudulent", within the meaning of decisions interpreting 28 U.S.C. � 144L In remanding a substantially identical action to state court after it was removed Lo Ihe United States District Court, Judge James Lawrence King held, "Plaintiffs have laid out a reasonable argument that Vector is a liable successor, . . . Plaintiffs have established a possibility that Vector controls [Defendant] Liggett and is liable as Liggett's

alter ego-----It is possible that a state court will find a cause of action against Vector." Miller,

et al v. RJ. Reynolds, etal, 07-212274 (S.D. Fla. Aug 17, 2007). Other judges throughout the Southern District of Florida agree with this conclusion. See Brown v. RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-60432-CiV-MIDDLEBROOKS (S.D. Fla. Aug. 22, 2007); Alonso v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-22252-CIV-K1NG (S.D. Fla. Sep 11, 2007); Ross v. RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-22251-CIV-KING (S.D. Fla. Sep. 11, 2007); Davis v, RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Co., No. 07-22308-CIV-MOR�NO(S.D. Fla. Sep. 25, 2007); Caprio v. RJ.

Accordmgiy, no basis for the removal of this action to the United States District Court exists because the United States District Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action,

20.    The Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A., Inc. ("Council") and the Tobacco Institute, Inc. ("Institute"), at all times relevant to this action, were involved in promotion, lobbying, medical research, legislative, and political activities or related ventures throughout Florida and the United States both in connection with and on behalf of Defendants,

At all material times, the smoking Plaintiff was a Florida citizen or resident who suffered from diseases and/or medical conditions caused by her addiction to cigarettes that contained nicotine. Therefore, the Plaintiff has Engle class member status.

22.    Plaintiff purchased, smoked and was addicted to cigarette products containing nicotine which were the subject of Engle. The cigarette products containing nicotine were designed, manufactured, advertised, and marketed by Defendants at all material times.

23.    As to each Count of this Complaint, the Plaintiff used cigarettes manufactured by each of the Defendants, including their predecessors and successors.

24,   Plaintiff asserts the jury findings from the Phase 1 Engle trial which were given res judicata effect by the Florida Supreme Court, including but not limited to the following:

a.      Smoking cigarettes causes aortic aneurysm, bladder cancer, cerebral vascular disease, cervical cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease (including cardiovascular disease, hardening of the arteries, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease and arteriosclerosis, angina, abnormal blood clotting, blood vessel damage, myocardial infarction (heart attack)), esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, laryngeal cancer, lung cancer (specifically, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma), complications of pregnancy, oral cavity/tongue cancer, pancreatic cancer, peripheral vascular disease, pharyngeal cancer, and stomach cancer.

b.      Nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.

c.      All Defendants placed cigarette on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous.

d.      All Defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available, knowing that the material was false or misleading, or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or both.

e.      All Defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers and the public would rely on this information to their detriment.

f.       All Defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective,                              c^
pgNbr=564
g.     All Defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to representations of fact made by Defendants, h.     All Defendants were negligent.

25.    At all times relevant to this action, the Smoking Plaintiff herein was (1) addicted to, purchased, and smoked cigarettes containing nicotine that were designed, manufactured, advertised, and marketed by all of the Defendants, and (2) did so in sufficient quantities and for a sufficient time period to cause or substantially contribute to causing injury or aggravation of a preexisting condition in the form of diseases and medical conditions, including the form of diseases and medical conditions that ultimately resulted in the injuries of the Smoking Plaintiff,

26.    As a direct and proximate result of smoking cigarettes manufactured and sold by all of the Defendants, the Smoking Plaintiff suffered from one or more of the diseases and medical conditions described above. The diseases and medical conditions suffered by the Smoking Plaintiff were a result of her addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine, and the Smoking Plaintiffs diseases or medical conditions manifested during the class period and caused the injuries of the Plaintiff.

27.    The Smoking Plaintiff bears some measure of fault, but less than 100% of the applicable fault, for causing her respective smoking-related injuries. The Smoking Plaintiffs acts or omissions relating to the frequency and duration of her efforts to quit smoking were a partial proximate cause, in combination with the acts and omissions of Defendants, of her injuries. The Plaintiff therefore seeks apportionment of fault and damages on all Counts other than those alleging intentional torts.

28.    Venue is proper in Broward County because the cause of action accrued in Broward County and/or one or more Defendants is a foreign corporation that has an agent or other
pgNbr=565
representative in Broward County.

29.    This action is timely because this Second Amended Complaint relates back to the initial Complaint which was filed within one (1) year of the Florida Supreme Court's mandate in Engle.

MEMORANDUM:

In a sense, the tobacco industry may be thought of as being a specialized, highly ritualized and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry, Tobacco products, uniquely, contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects. Related alkaloids, and probably other compounds, with desired physiological effects are also present in tobacco and/or its smoke.

1S mmhh

Nicotine is k%tm to be a habit-forming alkaloid, hence the confirmed user of

tobacco products^* primarily seeking the physiological "satisfaction" derived

from nicotine � and perhaps other active compounds. His choice of product

and pattern of usage are primarily determined by his individual nicotine

dosage requirements and secondarily by a variety of other considerations

Including flavor and irritancy of the product, social patterns and needs,

physical and manipulative gratifications, convenience, cost, health considerations,

and the like. Thus a tobacco product is, In essence, a vehicle for delivery of

nicotine, designed to deliver the nicotine in a generally acceptable and

attractive form* Our Industry is then based upon design, manufacture and sale

of attractive dosage forms of nicotine, and our Company's position in our

Industry is determined by our ability to produce dosage forms of nicotine which

have more overall value, tangible or intangible, to the consumer than those

of our competitors,                                                                                                                                            ^

The habituated user of tobacco products is said to derive "satisfaction"           ^

fro. nicotine.   Although auch studied, the phyS1o,o�,cal actions of nicotine             S are still poorly understood and appear to be many and varied.   For example, in different situations and at different dose levels, nicotine appears to act as

a   stimulant, depressant, tranquilizer, psychic energizer, appetite reducer,            �

anti-fatigue agent, or energizer, to name but a few of the varied and often             M

contradictory effects attributed to it. Many of these same effects may be achieved with other physiologically active materials such as caffeine, alcohol, tranquilizers, sedatives, euphorics, and the like. Therefore, In addition to competing with products of the tobacco Industry, our products may. In a sense, compete with a variety of other products with certain types of drug action. All of these products, tobacco and other, appear to have certain common attributes in that they are used largely to relieve, in one way or another, the fatigues and stresses which arise 1n the course of existence in a complex society.

Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is 4>oth habltuating-md unique in Its variety of physiological actions, hence no other active material or combination of materials provides equivalent "satisfaction". Whether nicotine will, over the long term, maintain its unique position 1s subject to some reasonable doubt. With increased sophistication of knowledge in the biological and pharmaceutical areas, a superior or at least equivalent product or product mixture may emerge. For this reason, it would be a mistake to assume that the tobacco industry, as we now know it, 1s immortal or that no direct competition from organizations outside of the tobacco Industry will ever occur. It 1s safe to assume, however, that nicotine will retain its      q unique position throughout the present ten year planning period, and probably    ^ for a *uch longer span of tine.

If nicotine is the sine ojja non of tobacco products and tobacco products

are recognized as being attractive dosage forms of nicotine, then it is                      �

logical to design our products � and where possible, our advertising � around       **

nicotine delivery rather than "tar" delivery or flavor.   To do this we need to         u

PT01920-0004
pgNbr=581
develop new data on such things as the physiological effects of nicotine, the rate of absorption and elimination of nicotine delivered 1n different v doses at different frequencies and by different routes, and ways of ^    enhancing or diminishing nicotine effects and "satisfactions". In the absence of such data, we stay survey the market and conclude that current cigarette products delivering about 1.3 rog. of nicotine appear to "satisfy" the typical smoker. This, somewhat crudely, establishes a target dosage level for design of new products. An accompanying Research Planning Proposal describes that approach in some detail. However, if we knew more about nicotine absorption, action, elimination, enhancement and the like, 1t should, in theory, be possible to more precisely specify, and deliver, the optimum amounts of nicotine activity in sophisticated products which would be more satisfying and desirable to the user. This area merits consideration and activity.

(f/      Before proceeding too far in the direction of design of dosage forms for

V.'

\    nicotine? it may be well to consider another aspect of our business; that 1s�

the factors which Induce a pre-smoker or non-smoker to become a habituated

smoker.   Paradoxically, the things which keep a confirmed smoker habituated

and "satisfied", I.e., nicotine and secondary physical and manipulative

gratifications, are unknown and/or largely unexplained to the non-smoker.   He              oi

CO

does not start smoking to obtain undefined physiological gratifications or                   o

reliefs, and certainly he does not start to smoke to satisfy a non-existent                 oi

CO

craving for nicotine.   Rather, he appears to start to smoke for purely                           ^ psychological reasons -� to emulate a valued image, to conform, to experiment,

to defy, to be daring, to have something to do with his hands, and the like.                w

Only after experiencing smoking for some period of time do the physiological               �

"satisfactions" and habituation become apparent and needed.    Indeed, the first           �

PT01920-0005

i)

smoking experiences are often unpleasant until a tolerance for nicotine has been developed.   This leaves us, then, in the position of attempting to design and promote the same product to two different types of market with two different sets of motivations, needs and expectations,   The same situation is encountered in some industries, but the problem is usually not as severe.

If what we have said about the habituated smoker is true, then products designed for him should emphasize nicotine, nicotine delivery efficiency, nicotine satisfaction, and the like*   What we should really make and sell would be the proper dosage form of nicotine with as many other built-in attractions and gratifications as possible -*- that is, an efficient nicotine delivery system with satisfactory flavor, mildness, convenience, cost, etc. On the other hand, if we are to attract the non-smoker or pre-smoker, there is nothing in this type of product that he would currently understand or desire.   He have deliberately played down the role of nicotine, hence the non-smoker has little or no knowledge of what satisfactions 1t may offer him, and no desire to try it.   Instead, we somehow must convince him with wholly irrational reasons that he should try smoking, in the hope that he will for hlnelf then dfscover the real -satisfactions" obtainable.   And. of course, in        8 the present advertising climate, our opportunities to talk to the pre-smoker              �

are Increasingly limited, and therefore. Increasingly ineffective,   Would It                S

not be better, In the ,on9 run, to Identify In our own ninds and In the rfnds             8

of our customers what we are really selling, i.e., nicotine satisfaction? This would enable us to speak directly of the virtues of our product to the confirmed smoker, and would educate the pre-smoker, perhaps indirectly but effectively, in what we have to offer and what it would be expected to do              S

for him.





<D

PT01920-000C
pgNbr=583
But again, the picture is not quite all that clear. Critics of tobacco products Increasingly allege that smoking is dangerous to the health of the smoker. Part of this alleged danger Is claimed to arise from ingestion of nicotine and part is claimed to arise from smoke components or smoke "tar". If, as proposed above, nicotine is the sine qua non of smoking, and if we meekly accept the allegations of our critics and move toward reduction or elimination of nicotine from our products, then we shall eventually liquidate our business. If we intend to remain In business and our business is the manufacture and sale of dosage forms of nicotine, then at some point we must make a stand. We should know more, rather than less, than our. critics about the physiological effects of nicotine, and we should 1n all ways scientifically validate and speak to the beneficial effects and "satisfactions" derived from use of nicotine. Essentially all commercial drugs give rise to some undesirable side effects, but we continue to use them with great benefit to humanity because of their overriding beneficial effects. Might we not take a leaf from that book in our approach to nicotine? Unless we do, our long-term prospects become unattractive.

Our critics have lumped "tar" and nicotine together 1n their allegations  #-about health hazards, perhaps because Mtar" and nicotine are generated together in varying proportions when tobacco is smoked. An accompanying Research Planning Memorandum suggests an approach to reducing the amount of "tar" in cigarette smoke per unit of nicotine. That Is probably the most realistic approach In today's market for conventional cigarette products. However, another more futuristic approach is possible which goes more directly to the fundamentals of the alleged problem.

If our business is fundamentally that of supplying nicotine in useful dosage form, why is it really necessary that allegedly harmful "tar" accompany that nicotine?   There should be some simpler, "cleaner", more efficient and direct way to provide the desired nicotine dosage than the present system involving combustion of tobacco or even chewing of tobacco. A conventional 1000 mg. tobacco rod containing about 20 mg. of nicotine is smoked to produce only about 1.3 mg of smoke nicotine, accompanied by about 20 mg. of "tar" and 20 mg. of gas phase matter; and a^uuulunliiil part of the 1.3 mg of smoke nicotine is lost to the smoker via exhaled smoke � surely an inefficient nicotine delivery system,   It should be possible to obtain pure nicotine by synthesis or from high-nicotine tobacco.   It should then be possible, using modifications of techniques developed by the pharmaceutical and other industries, to deliver that nicotine to the user 1n efficient, effective, attractive dosage form, accompanied by no *tar\ gas phase, or other allegedly harmful substances.   The dosage form could incorporate various flavorants, enhancers, and like desirable additives; and would be designed to deliver the minimum effective amount of nicotine at the desired release-rate to supply the "satisfaction* desired by the user.   Such a product would maximize the benefits derived from nicotine, minimize allegedly undesirable over-dosage side effects from nicotine, and eliminate exposure to other materials alleged to be harmful to the user.   For the long term, we should be working toward development of such products -- if we do not, Inevitably someone else will, and there are strong indications that others are already moving In this direction.

In the present real situation, where nothing has been done to counteract the adverse allegations about nicotine and where conventional products delivering adequate amounts of nicotine dominate the marketplace, no abrupt change in our posture or strategy would be appropriate or reasonable. The approaches advocated above are aimed at stopping and eventually reversing a trend that may in the long term put us out of business, and are intended to lay a framework of philosophy around which research efforts may now begin. Hopefully, some day we will rejoice rather than despair when a new crop of tobacco shows an unusually high content of nicotine, our primary product. Hopefully, with time we will be able to develop sophisticated and Improved��.. minimum dosage forms for nicotine which will be more satisfying to the user and free of alleged health hazards.   And hopefully, by that time, we will have been able to establish and use information showing that use of nicotine fills real, demonstrable human needs, the beneficial effects overriding the allegedly harmful side effects.

INDICATED RESEARCH DEPARTMENT ACTIVITIES AND APPROACHES:

If the above is a valid line of reasoning, then our long-term future courses of action should be as follow:

1.    Recognize the key role of nicotine in consumer satisfaction, and design and promote our products with this in mind.

2.    More precisely define the minimum amount of nicotine required for "satisfaction" in terms of dose levels, dose frequency, dosage form, and the like.   This would Involve biological and other experiments.

3.    Sponsor in-depth studies of the physiological, psychological and other effects of nicotine, aimed at demonstrating the beneficial effects of nicotine and at disproving allegations that nicotine produces major adverse effects.

4.  Study, design and evaluate new or improved systems for delivery of nicotine which will provide the minimum satisfying amount of nicotine in attractive form, free of allegedly harmful combustion products.

5.  Study means for enhancing nicotine satisfaction via synergists, alteration of pH, or other means, to minimize dose level and maximize desired effects,

6.  Monitor developments in materials and products which may compete with nicotine products or which might be combined with nicotine products to provide added advantages or satisfactions.

7.  Monitor work by others which might be aimed at Improved nicotine delivery systems of the type proposed here.

8.  Search for and evaluate other physiologically active components of tobacco or its smoke which may provide desired effects to the smoker.

DRAFT

SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT MEW BRANDS OF CIGARETTES FOR THE YOUTH MARKET

At the outset it should be said that ve are presently, and I believe unfairly, constrained from directly promoting cigarettes to the youth market: that Is, to those In the approximately twenty-one year old and under group. Statistics show, however* that large, perlfaps even increasing, numbers in that group are beconing smokers each year, despite bans on proaotloa of cigarettes to them. If this be so, there is certainly nothing immoral or unethical about our Company attempting to attract those smokers to our products. We should not in any way influence non-smokers to start smoking; rather we should simply recognize that many or most of the "21 and under" group will inevitably become smokers, and offer them an opportunity to use our brands.

Realistically, if our Company Is to survive and prosper, over the long term, we must get our share of the youth market, In my opinion this vill require new brands tailored to the youth market; I believe It unrealistic to expect that existing brands identified with an over-thirty "establishment" market can ever become the "in'1 products with the youth group. Thus we need new brands designed to be particularly attractive to the young smoker, while ideally at the same time being appealing to all smokers.

Several things will go to make up any such new "youth" brands, the most important of which may be the linage and quality - which are, of course, interrelated The questions then are: What Image? and Vhat quality? Perhaps these questions may best be approached by consideration of factors influencing pre-smokars to try smoking, learn to smoke end become confirmed smokers.

!       Table I attempts co define tone of the more important effects expected or derived from cigarette.amoking by pre-amokers, �'learning" smokers and confirmed smokers* If this incomplete, subjective, simplistic analyaia is even approximately correct, there are sharp, perhaps exploitable, differences between pre-emokere, "learners" and confirmed smokers in terms of vhat they expect or derive from smoking. Let ua examine these differences*

For the pre-sooker and "learner" the physical effects of smoking are largely unknown, unneeded, or actually quite unpleasant or awkward, the expected or derived psychological effects are largely responsible for influencing the pre-looker to try smoking, and provide sufficient motivation during the "learning" period to keep the "learner" going, despite the physical unpleasantness and awkwardness of the period.

In contrast, once the "learning" period ia over, the physical effects become of overriding importance and desirability to the confirmed smoker, and the psychological effects, except the tention-relieving effect, largely wane in Importance or disappear.

The common thread binding the three groups together appears to be the fact that smoking of cigarettes offers and provides a desired mechanism for coping with the stresses of living, which may range from boredom to high tension and from fatigue to high arousal and hyperactivity. Once this mechanism haa been experienced and used, physical and psychological habit patterns are firmly established snd become self-perpetuating,

If tbe above analysis is approximately correct* then the basic theme for promoting any cigarette to any group should aim, directly or indirectly* at the desirability of using a given brand as a mechanism for coping with stress. Brands tailored for the beginning smoker should emphasize the desirable psychological effects of smoking, also suggesting the desirable physical effects to be expected later. Happily, theo, it should be possible to aim a cigarette promotion at tbe beginning smoker, at the same tine making it attractive to the confirmed smoker. The information and outline in Table 1 then may be used as a basis for arriving at some specifications for nev "youth" brands and for determining how they should be promoted.

I. PHYSICAL EFFECTS

Hsvlng identified these as highly desirable to the confirmed smoker but largely unknown, unpleasant, awkward and/or undesirable to the pre-smoker or "learner", the effort here should be to ft feet a compromise to minimize the undesirable effects while retaining these which later become desirable�

A.  Nicotine Effects - Nicotine should be delivered at about 1*0-1.3 mg./cigarette,

the minimum for confirmed smokers. The rate of absorption of nicotine

should be kept low by holding pH down, probably below 6.6-

cn

B.  Sensory Effects                                                                                                                                                �

*                                            o

1.  IrrluncyBarshness - The beginning smoker and inhaler has a low tolerance   CD

cn for smoke irritation, hence the smoke should be as bland as       CD

possible*                                                                                                                                "^

2.  Flavor - The flavor of tobacco snoke is initially foreign, and not pleaaant.

One cultivates a taste for smoke much as one learns to like     o

U"

olives or dry vines. Perhaps, as in the case of taste of water, J3

there la no really "good" flavor, only degrees of ''bad" flavor.   Jf

u

Thus for the beginning smoker the cigarette smoke should have a

i PT02275-0005
pgNbr=592
moderate level of blended tobacco flavor* but should be ,aa free as possible from strong, unpleasant flavors such as steamy flavor, etc. A "tar" delivery of 12-14 ng/clgarette should provide the desired flavor level. 3. Other HouttrFeel - Hie swoke should be "bland'1 with respect to

astringeney, homes*, dryness and the like. Again, the theory Is that any nouth effect is new and different, hence should be as bland and free of obvious negatives as possible, A. Visual - The package and cigarette should be pleasing to the eye, as will be discussed further below. The amount and density of exhaled smoke should be such as to be clearly visible and not thin or scanty. A tar level of 10-14 mg/clgarette should meet this requirentnt. C. Manipulative Effects - Carrying, opening and using the package should be convenient. The cigarette should be as long as possible, probably 100 tro, to facilitate lighting. The rod should be reasonably firm, and a moderately soft, round filter tip should be used. The draft resistance prior to and during smoking should be as low as practical and should not exceed VANTAGE specifications. The product should require, thus,minimum effort and care to handle and use.

II. PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS

These are the expected or derived gratification* which Influence a pre-smoker to try smoking and vhich sustain the beginning smoker during the largely physically awkward and unpleasant "learning to smoke" phase. These effects also largely determine which brand the pre-smoker will experiment and learn with.

h.   Group Identification - Fre-smokers learn to saoke to identify with and

participate in ahared experiences of a group of associates. If the majority of one's closest associates smoke cigarettes, then there is strong psychological pressure* particularly on the young person, to Identify with the group, follow the crowd, and avoid being out of phase with the group's value system even though, paradoxically, the group value system may esteem individuality. This provides a large incentive to begin sacking. If this be true, then the sane effect strongly Influences the brand chosen, it likely being the popular, "in" brand used by ones close associates.

Thus a new brand aimed at the young smoker must somehow become the "in" brand and its promotion should emphasise togetherness, belonging and group acceptance, while at the same time emphasizing Individuality and "doing ones own thing."

B. Stress and Boredom Relief - The teens and early twenties are periods of intense psychological stress, restlessness and boredom. Kany socially awkward situations are encountered. The minute or two required to stop and light a cigarette, ask for a light, find an ash tray, and the like provide something to do during periods of awkwardness or boredom, and afford a little "tine-out period" when confronting a stressful situation. Smoking also gives one something to do with the bands, eyes, etc. and something to talk about in a situation where otherwise one might simply have nothing to do or say.

This desirable attribute of funking should be strongly

emphasized in promoting a nev youth brand.

C. Self-Image Enhancement - The fragile, developing ielf-image of the young person needs all of the support and enhancement It can get. Smoking nay appea? to enhance that self-image in a variety of ways. If one values, for example, an adventurous, sophisticated* adult image, smoking may enhance ones self-image. If one values certain characteristics in specific individuals or types and those persons or types smoke, then if one also smokes he is psychologically a little more like the valued image. This self-image enhancement effect has traditionally been a strong promotional theme for cigarette brands and should continue to be emphasized.

P. Experimentation - There is a strong drive In most people* particularly the young, to try new things and experiences. This drive no doubt leads many pre-smokers to experiment with smoking, Simply because It is there and they want to know more about it. A nev brand offering something novel and different Is likely to attract experimenters, young and old, and if it offers an advantage It Is likely to retain these users.

There is another psychological factor which did not readily fall into Table 1, but which may be quite important. That category might be called "Anti-Eatabliahment Attitudes", It does*not enter ? into the decision to start smoking but may strongly influence the

brand chosen. Today more than ever, young people tend to reject      y,

o u*

whatever Is accepted by the "over-thirty" establishment, which       <-* ^

� GO includes their parents. If "Brand 30*" Is the accepted "in" brand     J N

2 to with the establishment, it is likely that many young smokers will     w

. 00

o

PT02275-0006
pgNbr=595
i

almost automatically reject that brand and start with something else. They will more likely start with "Brand 20+" vhlch Is both the "In" thing with their closest age group and the "out" thing with the "over-thirty" group. Probably in todays market, WINSTON i* the "Brand 30*" and Karlboro is the "Brand 20+". Happily, the Marlboro will eventually age out of its "in" position with youth, as WINSTON appears to have already done. Nov it the time to launch the next brand to becone the "in" cigarette with the next generation as Marlboro agea from "in" to, hoptfully "out and over-thirty" status, hence becomes something for youth to avoid. A final psychological factor vhlch also did not fall readily into Table I involves smoking-health attitudes. The amoklng-health controversy does not appear important to the group because, psychologically, at eighteen, one is immortal./ Further, if the desire to be daring is part of the motivation to start smoking, the alleged risk of smoking may actually make smoking attractive. Finally, if the "older" establishment is preaching against smoking, the antl-establlshment sentiment discussed above would cause the young to wane to be defiant and smoke. Thus, a new brand aimed at the young group should not in any way be promoted as a "health" brand, and perhaps should carry some implied risk. In this sense the warning label on the package may be a plus.

We have looked, at some length, at what.qualities and image a nev brand aimed at the youth market should have. At this point, it will be useful to summarize ^   what has been said} in admittedly general terms: Product Quality Factors

1.  Moderate level of nicotine (1.0-1.3 nig/cigarette) delivered at pH (5.B-6.6) to Insure slow absorption,

2.  Moderate level of blended tobacco flavor ("tar"of 12-14) free of undesirable (e.g. steamy) flavors.

3.  Bland, soft, moist mouth-feel, vlth minimal Irritancy, harshness, astringency, possibly very lightly mentholated.

4.  In "standard" range of diameter and firmness, vlth resilient filter or mouthpiece, probably 100 mm in length.

5.  Different package typa or packaging material, perhaps containing fever cigarettes, therefore less bulky.

6.  Some visible novelty or difference in product or package to set apart from conventional cigarettes, Ideally in direction of greater manipulative convenience for beginning smoker.

Product linage Factors

1.  Should emphasize participation, togetherness, and membership in a group, one of the group's primary values being Individuality.

2.  Should be strongly perceived as a mechanism for relieving stress, tension, awkwardness, boredom, and the like.

3.  Should be associated with doing one's own thing to be adventurous, different, adult, or whatever else is individually valued.

4.  Should be perceived as some sort of new experience, something arousing some curiosity, and some challenge.

5.  Should be different from established brands used by the over-thirty and  g

thing of the "young" group.                                                                                                       #  ID

The enumerated Product Quality Factors should be easy to achieve, except those requiring some Ill-defined novelty. The Product Image Factors, of course, describe a promotional approach, and it is most likely that the name and appearance of the product will here become crucial in establishing the desired image* The name nay be the moat important factor, determining the appearance of the package and suamarlting the image to be promoted.

Ideally, the name chosen should have a double meaning; that Is, one desirable connotation in "straight11 language and another in the Jargon of youth. A current example may be Kool, which reads on "cool" est in youth jargon, and also literally eonnotes a refreshing physical sensation. Another way of Approaching the name or image would be to choose one which evokes different but desiTable responses from different age groups. Thus the Marlboro western theme suggests independence, clean air, open spaces and freedom to the youth group, while at the same time suggesting the "good old days", hard work, white hats over black hats, and the like to the older generation. In passing, it la interesting to note that Marlboro is a distinguished, dignified British same, and there is a certain inconsistency in equating this image with the West.

A careful study of the current youth jargon, together with a review of currently used high school American history books and like sources for valued things night be a good start at finding a good brand name and image theme. This is obviously a task for marketing people, not research people.

Assuming that at some point marketing people will establish a name and image for � new youth brand, and assuming that the thoughts on product quality factors expressed above are approximately correct, then Research and TPD should be able to    o provide the product needed. Most of the product specifications defined are        o ^

achievable with present technology. Those which require new technology would appear  to O

to be: (1) control of irritancy and related mouth-feel factors to produce a bland      oi

smoke, and (2) creation of some useful, demonstrable novelty in filter, mouthpiece, package or other aspect of the product system.

Our Company needs to take advantage of the opportunity to market new youth brands of cigarettes. The thoughts expressed here may provide a preliminary agenda for discussions between Research, TFD. Marketing and Management, aimed at mote precisely defining what ve could ultimately make and promote. It is hoped that such discussions will soon ensue. Meanwhile, it becomes appropriate for Research to seek ways to  control smoke irritancy and to seek to create novel.

useful cigarette systems.                                                                 f*~----

WHAT'S KNOWN OH THIS SUBJECT! A body of research In the 1990s demonstrated that innovative marketing campaigns for cigarette brands had effectively encouraged adolescents to start smoking. The public health response included the 1998 MSA, which restricted.tobacco marketing to underaged youth.

WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: I his national cohort entered adolescence years after the provisions of the M3A went into effect However, the 2007 Camel No. 9 campaign was effective in encouraging young girls to start smoking.

CiNTCXT: The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) restricted tobacco industry advertising practices that targeted teens.

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether cigarette-advertising campaigns conducted after the MSA continue to influence smoking among adolescents.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Participants were a national longitudinal cohort ot 1MB adolescents (baseline age: 10-13 years) enrolled in a parenting study. Selween 2003 and 2008,5 sequential telephone interviews were conducted, including the participant's report of brand of "favorite" cigarette advertisement.The fifth interview was conducted after the start of RJ Reynolds' innovative "Camel No. T advertising campaign in 2007. Smoking outcome reported from the fifth survey.

RESULTS; The response rate through the fifth survey was 71.8%. Teenagers who reported any favorite cigarette ad at baseline (mean age: 11.7 years) were 50%more likely lo have smoked by the filth inlorvlew (adjusted odds ratio: 1,5195% confidence interval: 1.0-2,31). For boys, the proportion with a favorite ad was stable across all 5 surveys, as it was for girls across the first 4 surveys. However, after the start of the Camel No. 9 advertising campaign, Ihe proportion of girls who reported ci favorite ad increased by 10 percentage points, to 44%. The Camel brand accounted almost entirely for this increase, and the proportion of each gender that nominated the Marlboro brand remained relatively stable.

CONCLUSIONS: After the MSA. adolescents continued to be responsive to cigarette advertising, and those who were responsive were more likely to start smoking. Recent RJ Reynolds advertising may be effectively targeting adolescent girls. Perries 2010; 125:619-628

In 19913, the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) was enacted between states' attorneys general and the tobacco industry.' After convincing cv-i dense that tobecco marketi ng encouraged adolescent smoking" the agreement restricted several tobacco industry advertisingpracticcs/and to-hacco manufacturers; agreed not to "take any action, directly or indirectly, to target youth/'5 The MSA also funded a national youth education campaign aimed al reducing adolescent tobacco use.4 The Monitoring the Future study" has reported that 30-day smoking in US high school seniors declined from 35.1%in 1998 to 24.4% in 2003 (by 2.1% poryoar) and then declined further to 20.4% in 2008 (by 0.8% per year). The slowing rate of decline7 has raised concern about weakened tobacco industry complance with the MSA marketing restrictions.1

An important early strategy In product marketing is to encourage nonusers to try a new product; regular use may re quire additional strategies.9 Mass mo dia image-advertising has been used to effectively Increase axporimenta tlon, as evidenced by both the Virginia Slims10 and Joe Camel11 cigarette campaigns. Product placement In movies has also been demonstrated to be an effective marketing strategy.13 Such lobaccoindustrymarketlngcam paigns are persuasive communica-lions.'-1 As such, well-established the cry has noted a hierarchy of effects: target audiences need lobe exposed to the message; however, not all those exposed will attend to the message. Those who do attend and develop an emotive response such as liking the message will be the most likely to ex perimemV*15 In accordance with this theory, nomination of any favorite cigarette advertisement by never smokers predicted future experimentation in a sample of young California^ never-smokers."   In   confirmatory

follow-up studies of 2 separate California cohorts, nevcr-smokers who were receptive to tobacco advertising at the ages of 12 to 15 yeans were more than 50% more likely to bo adult smokers 6 years later.'7 It should be noted that enactment of the MSA was associated with a considerable decline in the proportion of adolescents who nominated a favorite cigarette advertisement,d

In the United Slates, ci^rctte-smoking initiation occurs between the ages of 12 and 24 years1*20 and is preceded by a period when the neversmokcr is cognitively susceptible to experiment21^1 Smoking experimentation is known to vary with race/ethniclty, parental educational level, family composition, and state of residence. Most studies have shown that adolescents who are exposed to other smokers (friends, siblings, parents) are at higher risk of experimentation, and poor school performance is a marker

for increased risk.*4 In 2007, the market share for fid Reynolds' Camel cigarettes increased sharply after years of slower growth.15 Industry analysts attributed the increase to the innovative fashion-themod Camel No. 9 marketing campaign aimed at young women that was launched in February 2007* Later in 2007, attorneys general from California and Ohio initiated investigations, and a formal complaint was filed with the Federal Trade Commission alleging that the Camel No. 9 cam paign violated MSA provisions on marketings children.^

We investigated whether nominating a favorite cigarette advertisement re mains a significant predictor of future experimentation In the post-MSA era by using a longitudinal study of adolescents (from 2003 to 2008). We hypothesized that HJ Reynolds' Camel No. 9 marketing campaign in 2007 coincided with Increased nomination of a favorite cigarette advertisementamong ad-

olescent girls but not boys. We also hypothesized that the proportion of girls, but not boys, who specifically nominated Camel as their favorite ad has increased and that proportions re mained relatively stable for those nominating Marlboro, a brand with broad appeal and strong market sharo that did not launch controversial ad campaigns during the study period.

METHODS

Study Participants

Participants were 10 to 13 years old when enrolled onto a trial on parenting practices. In 2003, a random-digit-dial telephone screening survey identified a nationally representative sample of households, oversamplcd for black participants. Of household members who responded to the screening survey, 3079 met the eligibility requirements of a family with an oldest child aged tOto 13 years. Over the next 14 months (distributed not to overload the study's intervention team), eligible families were invited to volunteer for a parenting study and a telephone contact was attempted to complete parent and teenager base line surveys. Wc enrolled 103(5 families with an estimated efficiency of 36% of families enrolled among eligible families, A detailed protocol for the parenting study has been published and included baseline characteristics of the sample." The intervention focused on helping parents achieve 3 parenting goals: build positive teen behaviors, set effective limits, and maintain a responsive relationship with their teenager.

pie; 67% of the US population), the lal-terto account for teenagers living with a parent or guardian. Parental education was similar to national averages. Twenty five percent of tho samplo and 23% of the US population resided in the Midwest, 40% of the sample (39% US population) in the South, 16% of the sample (18% US population) in the Northeast, and 19% (22% 1)3 population) in the West To minimize selection bias, the baseline sample was weighed to bo representative of the US population using these national population estimates, after initial base weights accounted for household selection probabilities. Weighting variables Included gender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non Hispanic black, and Hispanic/other), household composition (2-parent versus single-parent), and parental education (some college versus no college attendance). Sumy weights were constructed by using a standard raking procedure.5* Each adolescent follow-up survey was similarly weighted to these totals to adjust for loss to follow up.

Adol�sG*ut$iirv�y$

We interviewed the target adolescent 5 times at -ft-month intervals after re ceiving parental permission on each occasion. Baseline interviews {n -1036) were completed from September 2003 to October 2004 when the average respondent age was 12 years (median Interview month: February 2004). Subsequent surveys were con ducted as follows: survey 2, April 2O04 to Oct 2005 (median interview month: January 2005); survey 3, May 2005 to July 2006 (median interview month: January 2006); survey 4, April 2006 to April 2007 (median interview month; July 2006); and survey 5, July 2007 to September 2008 (median interview month: February 2008). Seventy-two percent of the original sample in -" 744) was retained through survey 5. Adolescents born in 1990 (ie, 13 years

old at baseline) were less likely to be retained for all surveys (64% retention rate), as were teenagers from non white families (63%), from a sin$o-parent home (59%), or with a parent who was a smoker (63%).

Adolescents who had reached 18years of age by survey 5 07 = 27) were excluded from the analyses because they were no longer underage for purchasing cigarettes. Among 957 retained baseline never-smokers, 681 were followed across all 5 surveys (retention rate: 73%). The average age of respondents at survey 5 was 15.7years.

Survey Measures

Tobacco-use items included, "Haveyou ever smoked a cigarette?" and, if not, "Haw you aver tried or experimented with cigarette smoking, even a few puffs?" A positive response to either question classified the person as 'having smoked."19-2* The remaining adolescents were classified as never smokers. Susceptibility to smoking among never-smokers was assessed as in previous research"21 with the questions, "Doyou think that in the future you might experiment with cigarettes?"; "At any time during the next year do you think you will smoke a cigarette?"; and "If one of your best friends were to offer you a cigarette, would you smoke it?" Any response other than "Definitely not" to any question classified the adolescent as a susceptible neversmoker.

Receptivity to tobacco advertising was measured as in our previous research1*'*17 and focused on whether

the teenager had a favorite cigarette

advertisement by asking, Think back to the cigarette advertisements you have recently seen What is the name of the cigarette brand of your favorite cigarette advertisement?" Respondents who did not namo a brand were also asked, "Of ail the cigarette advertisements you have seen, which do you

think attracts your attention the most?" Wo did not record when inter viewers used Ihi s prone. Those who responded "Don't know" or said they had nofavoritoadwere grouped as^none," and for all others, the name of the favorite brand was recorded. Teenagers wero asked lo rank their performance tn school as "much better than average," "better than average" "average," or "below average" Thi* measure has consistently predicted later smoking behavior in our studies.'1'*"-21 Smoking in the respondent's social network was assessed by the following 2 questions: "Have any people that you live with now smoked cigarettes in the last year?" and "How many of your best friends smoke?" Single parent family composition and parent educational status were assessed on the baseline parent survey.

Analytical Methods

Analyses were conduced by using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Jnc, Gary, NO; all estimates were weighted by the survey weights to be representative of the US population and to minimize non response bias. We used logistic regression to assess whether presence of a favorite ad among never smokers at baseline would predict experimentation by the fifth survey, and wo adjusted for the randomized group assignment as well as the baseline variables of gender, age, race (white versus nonwhite), geographic region, selfassessed school performance, living in a single-parent home, parental education, presence of friends who smoke, presence of other smokers in the house, and susceptibility to smoking.

13 years old (Table 1). No gender imbalance was observed among the 10 and 11-year-old smokers (3%-4%). However, among 12- to l.Vyear-olds, almost twice as many boys as girls had experimented (11.1% vs 6.5%). For both boys and gfrts, among non Hispanic white adolescents (67% of the sample), a lower proportion had ox penmented than other races/ethnicities. Parental college education (any college attendance) was associated with lower initiation during this eariy adolescent period for both boys and girls, but particularly so for girls. Teenagers from single parent families were more likely to have experimented than were other teenagers (boys, 12.0% vs 8.0%; girls, 8.3% vs 4.3%). Those who reported having below-avcragc grades in school were more likely to have tried smoking than wore others (hoys 12.6% vs 6.5%; girls 10.3% vs Z4%). The proportion who reported having smoked seemed to hs higher for boys who lived in the aouthem or mid-western United States compared with Ihose who lived in e itherth� northeast or tho western United States.

Predictors of Smoking Initiation

By survey 5 (completed in 20O8), 27% of baseline never-smokers reported having smoked. A logistic regression assessed which baseline variables predicted later smoking (Table 2). Non signi fica nt varia bics incl udc d age, gen der, race/ethnicity, parental educa tion, geographic region, and wholher the parent was randomly assigned to receive the parenting intervention. Teenagers from Jingle parent families (29%) were -70% more likely to smoke than those from 2 parent families (adjusted odds ratio [aOR|: 1,7 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-2.6]). Teenagers who Indicated al baseline that they had below average gradea in school (40% of sample) were twice as likely lo have smoked by survey 5 CaOR: 2.0 195% CI; 1.4-2.9]). Unly

Among baseline nevcr-smokers, the proportion of participants in each survey who reported thalthoy had a favorite cigarette ad Is presented in Fig 1 For girls (penel A), 31% lo 34% indicated o favorite advertisement across the first 4 surveys. However, on survey 5, conducted from July 2007 to September 2008, the proportion of girls having a favorite dgaretto ad increased to 44%, This increase reflected increased nominations for Camel as a favorite cigarette advertisement, and nomina lions for Marlboro wore relatively stable over the 5 surveys. During the first 4 surveys, -10% to 13% of girls chose Camel as their favorite ad (year 4 estimate: 12.2% + 3.3%). In survey 5, this estimate was 9.3 percentage points higher at 21.5%, with no overlap in con fidence limits. Nearly half (45%) of the girls who nominated Camel as a favor ite ad on surveys reported no favorite cigarette advertisement on survey 4, and only 3% had previously reported Marlboro.

The proportion of boys who nominated a favorite cigarette ad was 37.8% on survey 1 and essentially unchanged at 39.2% on survey 5 (panel D). The nomination of Moriboro was unchanged

but who reported a favorite cigarette advertisement had a 50% increase in probability of future experimentation with smoking.

The proportion of adolescents nominating a favorite cigarette advertisement was fairly constant (33% for girls, 38% for boys) across the 4 surveys administered between September 2003 and June 200'/. However, survey 5 recorded a large jump in the proportion of adolescent girls who nominated a favorite advertisement, with almost all the increase attributed to Camel nominations (a 43% relative increase). This was more than double the percentage-point increase observed among boys of the same age, whereas nominations for Marlboro remained stable for both boys and gsris. The theory of persuasive communication" predicts that this increase in receptivity should translate into increased smoking initiation in the remaining 5 years of the smoking-initiation age window. Our measure of favorite ad has always included a probe for adolescents who hesitate to nominate a favorite ad, asking them to nominate the ad that most attracts them, as indicated by theory.IS Without this probe, much lower rates of receptivity havo been reported, and the association of favorite ad with later smoking has been questioned52B

Considerable lay and business press accompanied the 2007 launch of the Came!

According la the RJ Reynolds Web site, Camel Is the company's largest and fastest-growing fuli-pricfc brand and has a track record of consistent share growth and marketplace momentum. It is one of the few full price brands In the industry that has shown sustained growth,26^ This study suggests that Camel'* Increased market share may reflect the company's reverting to strategies1**1 that were effective be fore the MSA when RJ Reynolds' Joe Camel advertising campaign was shown to target preadolescents:*M2

A strength of this study is its longitudinal design and its national sampling frame. Unlike previous studies that investigated the rola of! aha ceo advertising, this study represents every region of the country. Five separate surveys collected information both on rcceptiv-ity to cigarette advertising and smoking behavior, starting at the youngest adolescent ages. However, respondents to the national random-di git-dial survey were invited to participate in a study of parenting to prevent teen problem behaviors. Those who volun-

toored might be different from those who did not, although the demographics of the sample reflected those of tho general population.

The surveys were not designed to specifically investigate tobacco advertising and did not include multiple items to explore this question in depth, which are limitations to considerwhen interpreting our results. Also, although the timing of the surveys enabled exploration of issues related to the Camel No, 9 campaign, the average age of teenagers at survey 5 was 15.7 years. Experimentation with smoking continues at least through the age of 20.20 Hence, this study may underestimate the campaign's influence on smoking uptake, and additional follow up is needed. Another limitation was that the study did not collect detailed information on exposure to smoking in movies, and such exposure seems to be a stronger association with outcome than having a favorite advertisement.u An additional limitation is that the outcome variable is any smoking in adolescence rather than dependent smoking. However, in previous research, receptivity to tobacco advertising and promotions has pre-

CONCLUSIONS

This article presents credible evidence that the Camel No. 9 cigarette advertising campaign has targeted underaged girls. These findings suggest that the Camel No. 9 campaign may have been similar to the Joe Camel campaign in its targeting of underaged youth. Some 44% of adolescent girls nominated a favorite cigareltc ad in 2007, and the evidence in thi s na tioinal sample is con-sistent with eatiler studies showing that these girls are at a 50% increased risk of starting to smoke. Numerous public complaints have alleged that this Camel No, 9 campaign and other recent RJ Reynolds campaigns h3vc vi ololcd the MSA. This study provides evidence to support these complaints.

Message from Kathleen Sebelius

Secretary of Health and Human Services

Tobacco is the leading cause of preventable and premature death, killing an estimated 443,000 Americans each year. Cigarette smoking costs the nation $% billion in direct medical costs and $97 billion in lost productivity annually. In addition to the billions in medical costs and lost productivity, tobacco is enacting a heavy toll on young people.

Each day in the United States, over 3,800 young people under IB years of age smoke their first cigarette, and over 1,000 youth under age 18 become daily cigarette smokers. The vast majority of Americans who begin daily smoking during adolescence are addicted to nicotine by young adulthood. Despite the well-known health risks, youth and adult smoking rates that had been dropping for many years have stalled. When this Administration took office, we decided that if these numbers were not changing, we had to do something. We accelerated our efforts to fight tobacco by helping Americans stop smoking and proteel ing young people from starting to smoke.

The first step was the historic Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act which gives the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products to prevent use by minors and reduce the impact on public health. The law includes many vital provisions, including a ban on cigarettes with certain characterizing flavorings such as candy and fruit, restrictions on the sale of single cigarettes and the prohibition of markaing practices aimed at children. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act also provides for graphic warning labels that make the danger of smoking abundantly clear.

Second, as part of die Recovery Act, the Department of Health and Human Services (Hi IS} invested $225 million to support tobacco prevention and control efforts in states. Tbese-investmenfar wcre made in communities that have used evidence-based tobacco interventions and will eventually become models for the rest of the country.

The third step was the Affordable Care Act, whkh provides a new opportunity to transform how our nation addresses tobacco use through the Prevention and Public Health Fund. The law expands access to recommended treatment programs, such as tobacco use cessation, often at no additional cost For the first time, Medicare and Medicaid will cover tobacco use cessation for all beneficiaries. The health care law also provides support for state 1-800 quit lines and implementation of innovative social media initiatives including text messaging and smart phone applications.

Wc are using the many tools at our disposal from regulatory power to state and local investments, to end the tobacco epidemic. In November 2010, HHS announced the Department's first ever comprehensive tobacco control strategic action plan, tilled Ending the Tobacco Epidemic, which will help us bring all of these strategics together to achieve our goals. An important component of our HHS plan focuses on preventing the initiation of tobacco use among young people, through hard-hitting mass media campaigns that will discourage our country's youth from starting to use tobacco products and motivate current tobacco users to quit. This key strategic action, combined with others in the plan, signify HHS's commitment to provide a clear roadmap for the future of tobacco prevention and control.

We have come a long way since the days of smoking on airplanes and in college classrooms, but we have a long way to go. We have the respoasibility to act and do something to prevent our youth from smoking. The prosperity and health of our nation depend on it

Message from Howard Koh

Assistant Secretary for Health

Tobacco use imposes enormous public health and financial costs on this nation�costs that are completely avoidable. Until we end tobacco use, more young people will become addicted, more people will become sick, and more families will be devastated by the loss of loved ones.

The simple fact is that we cannot end the tobacco epidemic without focusing our efforts on young people. Nearly 100% of adults who smoke every day started smoking when they were 26 or younger, so prevention is the key. The tobacco industry spends almost $10 billion a year to market its products, half of all movies for children under 13 contain scenes of tobacco use, and images and messages normalize tobacco use in magazines, on the Internet, and at retail stores frequented by youth. With a quarter of all high school seniors and a third of all young adults smoking, and with progress in reducing prevalence slowing dramatically, the time for action is now.

This, Surgeon General's Rejiort is an important addition to our base of knowledge on the prevalence, causes, effects, and implications of tobacco use by young people. It elucidates in powerful detail the factors that lead youth and young adults to initiate tobacco use, and the devastating health and economic impact of that decision on our nation as welt as on individuals, their families, and their communities. This report also identifies proven, effective strategies that hold the potential of dramatically reducing tobacco use.

The Department's overall tobacco control strategy is to strengthen and fully implement these proven, effective strategies as part of a comprehensive approach that combines educational, clinical, regulatory, economic, and social initiatives. In November 2010, the Department released Ending the Tbbacco Epidemic: A Tohaeea &mtmf~Strategic ActiorrPtart forihe 1J.S. Department aHfeahfrtmd� Human Services which provides a framework for coordinating this approach. The plan sets forth specific actions which HHS can implement to build on recent legislative milestones, respond to the changing market for tobacco products, and promote robust tobacco control programs at the federal, state, and community levels.

From 19D7 to 2004 youth smoking fell rapidly. Since that time smoking among high school seniors has continued to fall, but slowly from 24.4% in 2003 to 18.7% in 2010 (daily smoking among youth has fallen from 16.8% in 1999 to 7.3% in 2009). Since 20ai prevalence among adults has fallen from 21,6 to 193% in 2010 The current problem is not that the evidence-based tools that drove the progress from 1997 to 2004 stopped working; it is that they have not been applied with sufficient effort or nationwide. That these tools still work is reflected in the fact that many states have seen significant reductions since 2005. Between 2005 and 2010 twenty states had declines of 20% or more.

Even with decades of progress and recent tobacco control initiatives, however, we must do more. We have ample evidence that comprehensive, multi-component interventions are effedive at reducing tobacco use. But knowledge is not enough. We must also have commitment�the commitment to sustain comprehensive programs, to give our young people another perspective on tobacco, to create an environment that makes it harder for youth to smoke, to make cessation services accessible and affordable. It is within our grasp lo make the next generation tnbacco-free if we have the will to do so.

Foreword

Preventing smoking and smokeless tobacco use among young people is critical to ending the epidemic of tobacco use. Since the first Surgeon General's report on youth in 1994, the basis for concern about .smoking during adolescence and young adulthood has expanded beyond the immediate health consequences for the young smoker to a deeper understanding of the implications for health across the life span from early use of tobacco. Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United Slates, accounting for approximately 443,000 deaths, or about 1 of every 5 deaths, in the United States each year.

Since 1994, there have been many legal and scientific developments that have curtailed somewhat the tobacco companies' ability to market to young people. The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement eliminated most cigarette billboard and transit advertising, print advertising directed to underage yofuth, and limited brand sponsorship. In addition, the Master Settlement Agreement resulted in the release of internal tobacco industry documents that have been analyzed by scientists. Furthermore, during this time, the prices of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products also increased. These significant developments, among others, resulted in a sharp decrease in tobacco use among adults and youth. However, this progress has stalled in recent years.

More than 80% of adult smokers begin smoking by 18 years of age with 99% of first use by 26 years of age. In addition, adolescent smokeless tobacco users are more likely than nonusers to become adult cigarette smokers. Adolescents and young adults are uniquely susceptible to social and environmental influences to use tobacco, and tobacco companies spend billions of dollars on cigarette and smokeless tobacco marketing. The findings in Ihis report provide evidence that coordinated, high-impact intciventiora inckidir^fnass mediae

ing people from secondhand smoke and norms are effective in reducing the initiation and prevalence of smoking among youth. However, many of these comprehensive tobacco control programs remain underfunded. Now mare than ever, it is imperative that we continue investing in tobacco prevention and control. An increase in spending on sustained comprehensive tobacco control programs will result in reductions in youth and adult smoking rates and, ultimately, in health care cosh.

Reducing tobacco use is a winnable battle. We have the science and, with additional effort and support for evidence-based, cost-effective strategies that we can implement now, we will improve on our nation's health and our children's future.

Preface

from the Surgeon General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

Nearly all tobacco use begins during youth and young adulthood. These young individuals progress from .smoking occasionally to smoking every day. Each day across the United States over 3,800 youth under 18 years of age start smoking. Although much progress has been made to reduce the prevalence of smoking since the first Surgeon Ceneral's report in 1964, today nearly one in four high school seniors and one in three young adults under age 26 smoke.

Of every three young smokers, only one will quit, and one of those remaining smokers will die from tobacco-related causes. Most of these young people never considered the long-term health consequences associated with tobacco use when they started smoking; and nicotine, a highly addictive drug, causes many to continue smoking welt into adulthood, often with deadly consequences.

This Surgeon General's report examines in detail the epidemiology, Ivealth effects, and causes of tobacco use among youth ages 12 through 17 and young adults ages 18 through 25. For the first time tobacco data on young adults as a discrete population has been explored. This is because nearly all tobacco use begins in youth and young adulthood, and because young adults are a prime target for tobacco advertising and marketing activities. This report also highlights the efficacy of strategics to prevent young people from using tobacco.

After years of steady decrease following the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement of 1998, declines in youth tobacco use have slowed for cigarette smoking and stalled for use of smokeless tobacco. The latest research shows that concurrent use of multiple tobacco products is common among

young people; and soggesHhat smokeless- tobaccou^is-mcreasing-among Whi te males.      ------�

An important clement of this Surgeon General's report is the review of the health consequences of tobacco use by young people. Cigarette smoking by youlh and young adults is proven to cause serious and potentially deadly health effects immediately and into adulthood. One of the most significant health effects is addiction to nicotine that keeps young people smoking longer, causing increajMul physical damage. Early abdominal aortic atherosclerosis has been found in young smokers Which affects the flow of blood to vital organs such as the lungs. This leads to reduced lung growth that can increase the risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease later in life, and reduced lung function.

This report examines the social, environmental, advertising, and marketing influences that encourage youth and young adults to initiate and sustain tobacco use. Tobacco products are among the most heavily marketed consumer goods in the U.S. Much of the nearly $10 billion spent on marketing cigarettes each year goes to programs that reduce prices and make cigarettes more affordable; smokeless tobacco products are similarly promoted. Peer influences; imagery and messages that portray tobacco use as a desirable activity; and environmental cues, including those in both traditional and emerging media platforms, all encourage young people to use tobacco. These influences help attract youth to tobacco use and reinforce the perception that smoking and various forms of tobacco use are a social norrn-a particularly strong message during adolescence and young adulthood.

Many initiatives have been put into place to help counter the influences that encourage young people to begin tobacco use. The Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement in 1998 curtailed much of the advertising that was particularly appealing to young people. With the passage of the 2009 legislation giving the U.S. Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco products and tobacco advertising, we now have another important means of helping decrease the appeal of tobacco use to this population. Coordinated, multi-component interventions that include mass media campaigns, comprehensive community programs, comprehensive statewide tobacco control programs, price increases, and school-based policies have also proven effective in preventing onset and use of tobacco use among youth and young adults.

We know what works to prevent tobacco use among young people. The science contained in this and other Surgeon General's reports provides us with the information we need to prevent the needless suffering of premature disease caused by tobacco use, as well as save millions of lives. By strengthening and contmuing to build upon effective policies and programs, we can help make our next generation tobacco free.

Surgeon General's Report

Table hi     Four-level hierarchy for classifying the strength of causal inferences based ou available evidence

Level 1              Evidence; is sufficient to infer a causal relationship.

*Uv*f 2--^f� ~�Jj�wdence is $uj�ge$^lkuijnot suffideuCtcJi^r i causal relationship.*-   -,� ,      *   ~i-~

.     . ^              Evidence is inadequate to infer the presence or absence of i causal relationship (which encompasses

evidence that is sparse, of poor quality, or conflicting)

te^l 44 - **-"� i�Evidence is suggestive of no '&Q$J$ktm&hifl.x*  * - <   J *         "*^ ^             * ^"

When a causal association is presented in the chapter conclusions in this report, these four levels are used to describe the strength of the evidence of the association, from causal (1) to not causal (4). Within the report, other terms are used to discuss the evidence to date (i.e., mixed, limited, and equivocal evidence), which generally represent an inadequacy of data to inform a conclusion.

However, an assessment of a casual relationship is not utilized in presenting all of the report's conclusions. The major conclusions are written to be important summary statements that are easily understood by those reading the report Jiorne conclusions, particularly those

ter3 (epidemiology), ��ivuie~4 and data related to tobacco use among young people, and are generally not examinations of causal relationships. Kor those conclusions that are written using the hierarchy above, a careful and extensive review of the literature has been undertaken for this report, based on the accepted causal criteria (USDffliS 2004). Evidence that was charac-

terized as Ixvel 1 or Level 2 was prioritized for inclusion as chapter conclusions.

In additional to causal inferences, statistical estimation and hypothesis testing of associations are presented. For example, confidence intervals have been added to the tables in the chapter on the epidemiology of youth tobacco use (see Chapter 3), and statistical testing lias been conducted for that chapter when appropriate. The chapter on efforts to prevent tobacco use discusses the relative improvement in tobacco use rates when implementing one type of program (or jwliey) versus a control program. Statistical methods, including meta-analytic methods id longitiiduul u aj e4oryanalyse^are ateo-presented -to ensure that the methods of evaluating data are up to date with the current cutting-edge research that has been reviewed. Regardless of ttie methods used to assess significance, the five causal criteria discussed above were applied in developing the conclusions of each chapter and the report.

Major Conclusions

1.    Cigarette smoking hy youth and young adults has immediate adverse health consequences, including addiction, and accelerates the development of chronic diseases across the full life course.

2.    Prevention efforts must focus on both adolescents and young adults because among adults who become daily smokers, nearly all first use of cigarettes occurs by 18 years of age (88%), with 99% of first use by 26 years of age.

3.    Advertising and promotional activities by tobacco companies have been shown to cause the onset and continuation of smoking among adolescents and young adults.

8    Chapter!

4.    After years of steady progress, declines in the use of tobacco by youth and young adults have slowed for cigarette smoking and stalled for smokeless tobacco use,

5.    Coordinated, multicomponent interventions that combine mass media campaigns, price increases including those that result from tax increases, school-based policies and programs, and statewide or community-wide changes in smoke-free policies and norms are effective in reducing the initiation, prevalence, and intensity of smoking among youth and young adults.

Chapter Conclusions

The following are the conclusions presented in the substantive chapters of this report.

Chapter 2.The Health Consequences of Tobacco Use Among Young People

1.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between smoking and addiction to nicotine, beginning in adolescence and young adulthood.

2.    The evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to conclude that smoking contributes to future use of marijuana and other illicit drugs.

3.    The evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to conclude that smoking by adolescents and young adults is not associated with significant weight loss, contrary

------to-yotinfl ppnplA he tiffs---------........__..............

4.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between active smoking and both reduced lung function and impaired lung growth during childhood and adolescence.

5.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between active smoking and wheeling severe enough to be diagnosed as asthma in susceptible child and adolescent populations.

6.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between smoking in adolescence and young adulthood and early abdominal aortic atherosclerosis in young adults,

7.    The evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between smoking in adolescence and young adulthood and coronary artery atherosclerosis in adulthood.

Chapter 3. The Epidemiology of Tobacco Use Among Young People in the United States and Worldwide

1.    Among adults who become daily smokers, nearly all first use of cigarettes occurs by 18 years of age (88%), with 99% of first use by 26 years of age,

2.    Almost one in four high school seniors is a current (in the past 30 days) cigarelte smoker, compared with one in three young adults and one in five adults. About 1 in 10 high school senior mates is a current smokeless tobacco user, and about 1 in 5 high school senior males is a current cigar smoker.

3.    Among adolescents and young adults, cigarette smoking declined from the late 1990s, particularly after the Master Settlement Agreement in 1998, This decline has slowed in recent years, however.

jL-JSigmfianf dispatiuesin tobacco use rentain among young people nationwide. The prevalence of cigarette smoking is highest among American Indians and Alaska Natives, followed by Whites and Hispanics, and then Asians and Blacks. The prevalence of cigarette smoking is also highest among lower socioeconomic stalus youth.

5.    Use of smokeless tobacco and cigars declined in the late 1990s, but the declines appear to have stalled in the last 5 years. The latest data show the use of smokeless tobacco is increasing among White high school males, and cigar smoking may be increasing among Black high school females.

6.    Concurrent use of multiple tobacco products is prevalent among youth. Among those who use tobacco, nearly one-third of high school females and more than one-half of high school males report using more than one tobacco product in the last 30 days.

7.    Rates of tobacco use remain low among girls relative to boys in many developing countries, however, Ihe gender gap between adolescent females and males is narrow in many countries around the globe.

Chapter 4. Social, Environmental, Cognitive, and Genetic Influences on the Use of Tobacco Among Youth

1.    Given their developmental stage, adolescents and young adults are uniquely susceptible to social and environmental influences to use tobacco.

2.    Socioeconomic factors and educational attainment influence the development of youth smoking behavior. The adolescents most likely to begin to use tobacco and progress to regular use are those who have lower academic achievement.

3.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between peer group social influences and the initiation and maintenance of smoking behaviors during adolescence.

4.    Affective processes play an important role in youth smoking behavior, with a strong association between youth smoking and negative affect

5.    The evidence is suggestive that tobacco use is a heri-____table trait, more so for regular use than for onset. The

expression of genetic risk for smoking among young people may he moderated by small-group and larger social-environmental factors.

Chapter 5. The Tobacco Industry's Influences on the Use of Tobacco Among Youth

1.    In 2008, tobacco companies spent $9.94 billion on the marketing of cigarettes and $547 million on the marketing of smokeless tobacco. Spending on cigarette marketing is 48% higher than in 1998, the year of the Master Settlement Agreement Expenditures for marketing smokeless tobacco are 277% higher than in W&.

2.    Tobacco company expenditures have become increasingly concentrated on marketing efforts that reduce the prices of targeted tobacco products. Such expenditures accounted for approximately 84% of cigarette

marketing and more than 77% of the marketing of smokeless tobacco products in 2008_

3.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between advertising and promotional efforts of the tobacco companies and the initiation and progression of tobacco use among young people.

4.    The evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to conclude that tobacco companies have changed the packaging and design of their products in ways that have increased these products' appeal to adolescents and young adults.

5.    The tobacco companies' activities and programs for the prevention of youth smoking have not demonstrated an impact on the initiation or prevalence of smoking among young people.

6.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that there is a causal relationship between depictions of smoking in the movies and the initiation of smoking among young people.

Chapter 6- Efforts to Prevent and Reduce Tobacco Use Among Young People

1.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that mass media campaigns, comprehensive community programs, and comprehensive statewide tobacco control programs an prevent the initiation of tobacco use and reduce its prevalence among youth.

2.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that increases in cigarette prices reduce the initiation, prevalence, and intensity of smoking among youth and young adults.

3.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that school-based programs with evidence of effectiveness, containing specific components, can produce al least short-term effects and reduce the prevalence of tobacco use among school-aged youth.

Advertising and Other Promotional Activities Used by theTobacco Companies to Promote Tobacco Use Among Young People

introduction

There k strong, consistent evidence that advertising and promotion influence the factors that lead directly to tobacco use by adolescents, including the initiation of cigarette smoking as well as its continuation (USDHHS 1989,1994,1998,2000; Lynch and Bonnie 1994; Federal Register 1996; Lovato et al. 2003; NCI 2008). The effects of tobacco advertising on tobacco use have been addressed by reports of the Surgeon General (USDHHS 2000,2001) and an NCI monograph (NCI 2008). As documented in these reports, promotion and advertising by the tobacco industry muses tobacco use, including its initiation among youth. This conclusion has been buttressed by a multitude of scientific and governmental reports, and the strength of the evidence for causality continues to grow.

Tobacco companies recruit new smokers, and their advertising campaigns appeal to the aspirations of adoles-

(Perry 1999; Lovato et aL 2003; United States o. 1'hilip Morris USA, 449 P. Supp. 2d 1, 980 ID.D.C. 2006]; NCI 2008). There is strong empirical evidence that tobacco companies' advertising and promotions affect awareness of smoking and of particular brands, the recognition and recall of cigarette advertising, altitudes about smoking, intentions to smoke^ and actual smoking behavior. In fact, children appear to be even more responsive to advertising appeals than are adults (Pollay et al. 1996). As with all advertising, tobacco advertising frequently relies on imagery to appeal to an individual's aspirations and conveys very little, if any, factual information about the characteristics of the product. Advertising fulfills many of the aspirations of adolescents and children by effectively using themes of independence, liberation, attractiveness, adven-turousness, sophistication, glamour, athleticism, social acceptability and inclusion, sexual attractiveness, thinness, popularity, rebelliousness, and being "cool" (NCI 2008). A 2003 systematic review of the published longitudinal studies on the impact of advertising concluded "that tobacco advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke" (Lovato et al. 2003, p. 2). Both the industry's own internal documents and its testimony in court proceedings, as well as widely accepted principles of advertising and marketing, also support the conclusion that tobacco advertising recruits

new users during their youth (Perry 1999).

In the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, the major cigarette companies agreed to some limitations on advertising and promotions targeted directly at youth, yet the industry has continued to market tobacco heavily through traditional advertising and promotion with an increased emphasis on one-on-one approaches, such as direct mailings and online marketing. Although youth are no longer exposed to some forms of advertising, such as advertising on television or on outdoor billboards, they are still exposed to some direct marketing efforts (King and Siegel 2001; Siegel 2001). In addition, industry marketing efforts directed at young adults, which are permitted under the agreement, liave indirect spillover effects on youth through young adults who are aspirational role models for youth (Kastcnbaum ct al. 1972; Montepare and Lachman 1989; Zollo 1995). Marketing efforts directed at young adults may also have an impact on tobacco initiation rates itiUun-this-population, in that thg wmpaigfls-faave-been shown to encourage regular smoking and increase levels of consumption (Ling and Glantst 2002). There is also evidence that from 2002-2009 increasing numbers of young adults are initiating smoking though that increase leveled off in 20.10 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSAl, unpublislwd data, 2005-2010; see also Chapter 3, Appendix 3.1, Table 3.1.31).

In her landmark 2006 riding that the tobacco industry violated the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Ad (1970), Judge Gladys Kessler concluded that cigarette marketing recruits youth to smoke and that the major cigarette companies know it

Cigarette marketing, which includes both advertising and promotion, is designed to play a key role in the process of recruiting young, new smokers hy ex|>osing young people to massive amounts of imagery associating positive Qualities with cigarette smoking. Research in psychology and cognitive neuroscience demonstrates how powerful such imagery an be, particularly for young people, in suppressing perception of risk and encouraging behavior. Slovic WD, 53:22-63:11. Defendants' own statistics demonstrate how successful they have been in marketing their three main youth brands: Philip Morris's

Marlboro, ftJR's Camel, and torillard's Newport (United States v. Philip Morris USA, 449 R Supp. 2d 1,980 |D.& 20061).

In reviewing the evidence that explains how tobacco industry marketing affects adolescent smoking behaviors, this section will rely on the Theory of Triadic Influence (TTI) (Figure 5.1), which was introduced in Chapter 4, "Social, Environmental, Cognitive, and Genetic Influences on the Use of Tobacco Among Youth," and will also be used in Chapter 6, "Efforts to Prevent and Reduce Tobacco Use Among Young People." The TTI provides an organizing structure that allows assessment of the impact of marketing and advertising in conjunction with other important risk factors, such as peer and parental influence (including smoking or nonsmoking behavior), emotions, and cognitive processes. In brief, the industry uses marketing and advertising, which overtly shape sociocognitive factors, Lo influence tobacco use behavior.

Conceptual Framework

The processes by which tobacco marketing affects tobacco use among youth are complex and dynamic but cm DTiaBBHSptmliiifcd according lo evistlng theories of health behavior (Figure 5.1). The TTI assumes that health and risk behaviors are direct products of intentions. Behaviors such as experimentation with smoking and initiation, in turn, underlie the process to begin to smoke or not smoke. This assumption is consistent with concomitant theories such as the Theory of Reasoned Action and the Theory of Planned Behavior that demonstrate a strong link between intentions and behavior (Ajzen 1991; Armit-age and Conner 2001).

Factors that promote or deter smoking, as well as other health behaviors, generally can be organized into three interacting but distinct streams: intrapcrsonal, sodal-contextual, and cultural-environmental. The intra-oersonal stream involves biological and personality-related factors that serve as risk or protective factors for adolescent smoking. These factors can include propensity to take risks, self-concept, and self-esteem. The social-contextual stream starts with social situations, which provide context for dynamic interactions with other people, their actions, and their beliefs, and ends with adolescents' social normative beliefs that directly influence their behavioral intentions. The cultural-environmental stream encompasses macrolevel factors and processes, including cultural convention, societal practices, and public policy. These macrolevel factors then influence adolescents' attitudes and perceptions about tobacco use.

One example of the interaction of streams of influence is seen in the suggestion from the literature that congruence (or incongruence) between an adolescent's self-image and her or his stereotype of a smoker predicts whether that young parson will become a smoker (Aloise-Young and llennigan 1996). Here, stereotypes of a smoker, which come from the social and environmental streams of influence, interact with the intrapersonal stream to influence adolescent tobacco use.

Variables or factors that might influence smoking can be said to be at three distances from actual smoking behaviors: ultimate, distal, and proximal. Ultimate factors represent the underlying causes of health and risk behaviors, including smoking. Distal factors include those that predispose youth to smoking, including peer influence, self-esteem, and cultural norms. Proximate factors are components of the process that more immediately precede behavioral change, including attitudes, beliefs, and intentions.

Much of the tobacco industry's efforts to promote smoking, including advertising and direct marketing as well as industry-sponsored youth smoking prevention advertisements (landman et aL 2002; Wakefield et at. 2006c), act at multiple levels and points within this triadic framework. Tobacco promotion can directly influence both -4�xiai^rtertaaiand cultural-gnATOWHffltai-straamSv-^v addition, promotion can have an influence very early in the development of adolescents' tobacco use when Ihey are forming altitudes and beliefs about tobacco. At this level, the influence of tobacco advertising and promotion is through mediated pathways. Advertising, promotion, industry-sponsored antismoking ads, and smoking in movies all directly influence distal-kvel factors, such as exposure to other smokers, peer attitudes, cultural practices, and beliefs about smoking consequences (both positive and negative). As a consequence, studies that treat peer and family smoking as independent variables understate the effects of advertising. These distal-level factors carry the influence of the tobacco industry all the way down to actual intentions and behavior. These pathways of influence are consistent wilh Flay's (199S) five stages of the initiation and continuation of smoking among adolescents as described in the 1&94 Surgeon General's report (USDtttlS 1994).

Industry marketing activities can also act as a moderator of processes at lower levels in the conceptual framework. Specifically, repeated exposures to advertising, promotion, and smoking in the movies can amplify the effects of the industry's influences on the social-contextual and cultural-environmental streams of influence. For example, some industry-sponsored antismok-ing ads seem to influence adolescents' perceptions and attitudes about smoking (proximal factors) in ways that

encourage smoking; this is an example of influencing the cultural-environmental stream. Smoking in the movies can influence both social-contextual and culturaKenvi-ronmental streams. (Industry-sponsored youth smoking prevention advertisements and smoking in the movies are discussed in later sections of this chapter.) In all three cases, the relation-ship between industry marketing, depictions of smoking in movies, and youth smoking arc moderated mediation pathways: the influences of advertising, promotion, and smoking in the movies are mediated by distal factors (e.g.p peer influence, family, culture), and that mediation effect on proximate factors is moderated by more exposure to the influence of the tobacco industry and depictions of smoking (Muller et at, 2005). Tlie effectiveness of antitobacco media campaigns (discussed in detail in Chapter 6) also supports this model for the effectiveness of protobacco advertising and promotion, as antitobacco media operate through the same channels. Anti-industry messages in particular tend to blunt the tobacco industry's ability to shift attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use, and they create momentum against tobacco use. Evaluation of all components of this framework are essential, particularly the monitoring of tobacco companies' activities and efforts to prevent young people's tobacco use (Cru?, 2009; Farrelly 2009).

Awareness ot amoiung ana me Recognition of Brands

Many studies from the early 1990s found that young children were frequently familiar with cigarette logos. For example, Fischer and coworkers (1991) reported that 30% of 3-ycar-olds and nearly all (91%) 6-year-old children could correctly match a picture of Joe Camel with a picture of a cigarette. The latter percentage equaled the percentage of 6-year-olds who associated Mickey Mouse with the Disney Channel (Fischer et al. 1991). (This equivalent awareness was all the more remarkable because, unlike Mickey Mouse, Joe Camel did not appear on television, which the average child spends viewing many hours each day.) The study of Fischer and colleagues did not claim to assert a retotionsh ip between children's familiarity with cigarette brand logos and their subsequent smoking behavior; it did, however, establish thai marketing efforts were reaching very young children and that these children were aware that the Joe Camel cartoon character was associated with cigarette smoking. Earlier studies of 11- to 14-year-olds in Australia, found that adolescents who smoked were much more likely to correctly identify advertisements for cigarettes that had words missing and to be able to complete cigarette slogans than were nonsmoking adolescents

(Chapman and Fitzgerald 1982). Tliese findings document the association between awareness of cigarette marketing campaigns and smoking behavior. Similar findings were reported in 1985 in Scotland and in 1987 and 2005 in the United States (Aitkcn et al. 1985; Goldstein et al. 1987; Daltonetal.2005).

Many studies demonstrate that those young people who are more familiar with tobacco advertising can identify specific advertisements, have a favorite tobacco advertisement, or possess cigarette promotional items are more likely to begin smoking than those who do not have these characteristics (Arnett and Terhanian 1998; Fcighery et al. 1998; NCI 2008). For example, Pierce and coworkers (1998) found that among a group of confirmed never smokers (aged 12-17 years) who were assessed in 1993 and followed up in 1996, those who had a favorite cigarette advertisement or who owned or were willing to own a brand promotion item were more likely to have experimented with cigarettes or to intend to smoke than those who did not have a favorite ad or possess promotional items. This continued to be observed at the 5-year follow-up (Pierce etal. 2010).

The 2000 Surgeon General's report on reducing tobacco use stated that "indirect evidence of the importance of advertising and promotion to the tobacco industry ..is provided by-surveys-that suggest that most adolescents can recall certain tobacco advertisements, logos, or brand insignia; these surveys correlate such recall with smoking intent, initiation, or level of consumption" (USDHHS 2000, p. 162).

Even earlier, research by Botvin and colleagues (1991) that asked adolescents to identify the brands in cigarette print ads that were stripped of brand information found that those who smoked and those who had experimented with cigarettes were more likely to name the brand associated with the ads than were nonsmoking adolescents. Much later, Hanewinkel and colleagues (2010a) used a similar approach to assess brand recognition and smokmg behaviors among German adolescents, m their sample, 55% of adolescents (included both smokers and nonsmokers) were able to recognize Lucky Strike ads, and 3*% recognized Marlboro.

The evidence shows that advertising and promotion by the tobacco industry are effective in raising awareness of smoking, increasing brand recognition, and creating favorable beliefs regarding tobacco use. This relationship has been shown not only for adults but also for youth. For example, a 1998 study of students in grades 6-12 concerning cigarette advertisements in seven states found that 95% of the students had seen at least one advertisement featuring Joe Camel or the Marlboro Man, and fully one-half had seen these advertisements six or more times

(Arnett and Terlwnian 1998). More than one-half of the students believed that Joe Camel made smoking more appealing, and 40% of Ihe students had the same belief about the Marlboro Man. In another study, adolescents who responded positively to Camel and Marlboro ads also believed the ads made smoking more appealing {Arnett 2001).

This evidence demonstrates how advertisements may influence adolescents at the emotional level (e.g., by producing a positive impression upon exposure to advertisements) and the cognitive level (e.g., making smoking more appealing). Moreover, at the individual level this influence can translate to the proliferation of smoking attitudes and behaviors via the social-contextual and ailturaJ-envjroninental streams of the TTI model (Figure S.l).

Advertising and the Desire to Smoke

There is extensive scientific data showing (1) adolescents are regularly exposed to cigarette advertising,

(2)  they find many of these advertisements appealing.

(3) advertisements tend to make smoking appealing, and (A) advertisements serve to increase adolescents* desire to smoke (N<3 2008). The 2001 Surgeon General's report on women and smoking concluded, "Whatever children's view of smoking may be, as they approach the middle-school years, they become increasingly concerned with self-image, and messages contained in tobacco advertising and promotions likely play a rote in changing their attitudes and behaviors* (USDHHS 2001, p. 504).

A study among California middle sclwol students found that most students were at least moderately receptive to tobacco marketing materials, and those who were more receptive were also more susceptible to initiating, smoking (Feighery ct ah 1998). Moreover, susceptibility increased when a parent or friends smoked, but susceptibility also increased as a function of receptivity to promotional items, even when controlling for smoking by friends or parents. Elsewhere, in a randomized study, adolescents given magazines with tohacco advertisements reported more fawrable attitudes toward smoking than those who were provided with magazines free of tobacco advertising (Turco 1997). In another experimental study, seventh-grade student*: who were randomly assigned to view cigarette advertisements were more likely to have positive attitudes about smokers than those who viewed antismoking advertisements or advertisements unrelated to smoking (Pechmann and Ratneshwar 1994).

Influences on Intentions to Smoke

According to many theoretical models of behavior, including the TTI, behavioral intentions are immediate precursors to behavior and are one of the strongest predictors of future behavior. Systematic review have determined that behavioral intentions {along with perceived behavioral control, attitudes, and subjective norms) are strong and robust predictors of behavior (Armitage and Connor 2001; Sheeran 2002). Furthermore, research demonstrates that advertising and promotion have affected behavioral intentions toward smoking in a way that leads to increases in the susceptibility of adolescents to the initiation of smoking and progression to established smoking. In a 2002 study, ninth-grade students exposed to cigarette ads were found to have significantly more jwst-live beliefs about smokers as well as more positive intentions to smoke in the future than did those not exposed to such advertisements (Pechmann and Knight 2002). A study from Norway found that even in the presence of bans on advertising, limited exposure to tobacco marketing predicted both current smoking and intention to smoke in the future (Braverman and Aara 2004). Surveys were conducted among 13- to 15-year-old adolescents in Norway in 1990 and 1995 and, despite an advertising ban, 50% of the adolescents in each cohort reported exposure hytrthar kinds of tobacco marketing in the form of tobacco-related paraphernalia, imported newspapers, and broadcasts on television from other countries. After controlling for passible confounding factors, adolescents exposed to tobacco marketing were significantly more likely to be smokers or to expect to smoke by 20 years of age than those not exposed. This study establishes a clear association between early exposure and current and future smoking status, even when most forms of advertising are limited. These delayed effects help explain why limited restrictions on marketing so often have limited effects. A 1991 study of 640 children in Glasgow, Scotland, found that children aware of cigarette advertising at baseline were more likely to report increasing intention to smoke over the course of a year than were children less aware of or less interested in the ads. The latter group reported decreasing intention

to smoke (Aitken etal. 1991).

Behavioral intentions can also predict continued nonsmoking. Lack of a firm commitment to abstain from smoking is considered to be a cognitive susceptibility to smoking (Spelman et al. 2009). In a longitudinal study of 637 California adolescents, participants who did not express a firm commitment to not smoke were two to three times as likely to smoke at a 2-year follow-up (Unger et al. 1997). A longitudinal study using Monitoring the Future (MTF) data has illustrated the importance

o

of intentions not to smoke and the need for young people to develop and sustain firm future intentions not to smoke (Wakefield et al. 2004). After analyzing the data, Wakefield and colleagues (2004) concluded that "having a firm intention iwt to smoke in 5 year's (s/c) time exerts a generally protective effect upon the likelihood of future established smoking" (p. 918,921) that "has a protective effect, regardless of the level of current smoking experience" (p. 921). Even so, there is also evidence from the MTF data suggesting that intentions do not predict future quit behaviors. In two MTF-based studies, a large proportion of students who smoked believed they would not be smoking in 3 years, but approximately two-thirds were still smoking S--9 years later (Lynch and Ronnie 1994; Johnston et al. 2002). These last two studies demonstrate that, like mosl ariulls, adolescents underestimate the risk of addiction (Slovic 2001; Haipern-Peisher et al. 2004). As a rule, adolescents do not expect to smoke in the future and discount the power of nicotine addiction when projecting their future smoking status. Moreover, these studies demonstrate that even slight shifts away from firm commitments to abstain from tobacco use increase the ri.sk of adolescent smoking. In this regard, tobacco advertisements can exert an indirect influence on actual smoking behaviors by decreasing adolescents' intentions

Influence on Actual Smoking Behavior

There is strong and consistent evidence that marketing influences adolescent smoking behavior, including selection of brands, initiation of smoking, and overall consumption of cigarettes (Lovatn etal. 2003; DiPraroaet al 2006; Goldberg 2008; NCI 2008). This section reviews the empirical data from econometric studies, studies of brand preference, and studies on changes in the initiation of smoking among adolescents and their consumption of cigarettes. Some studies have looked at the association between expenditures for advertising and promotion and overall cigarette consumption, while others have looked at the relationship between such expenditures and brand preference. Still others have looked at the effect of marketing on children's and adolescents' smoking behavior.

Evidence from Econometric Studies

Econometric analyses can be used to examine the relationship between the independent variable of marketing expenditures and the dependent variable of overall cigarette consumption over time, controlling for possible

confounding or extraneous variables. In a 1992 econometric analysis, the Economics and Operational Research Division of the United Kingdom Department of Health issued what became known as the Smee Report (Department of Health 3992), which analyzed the results of 19 time-series studies of cigarette advertising from the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia. This report concluded that "the great majority of results [of aggregate statistical studies] point in the same direction - towards a positive impact Ion tobacco consumption]. The balance of evidence thus supports the conclusion that advertising does (uvea positive effect on consumption" (p. 22).

There are several limitations to econometric analysis, however, that make it difficult to quantify the relationship between advertising and use of tobacco. Because econometric analyses typically rery on aggregate marketing expenditures as a measure of the effect of marketing, the qualitative aspects of advertising, particularly the use of imagery, are not captured. In addition, econometric analyses have limited value when marketing expenditures are extremely large, in substantial measure because the marginal effect of additional dollars is difficult to assess. Some economists suggest that disaggregated data would have more variance and would more likely allow for assessing Ihe relationship between dianges in spe-cific marketing espendituces-aod- changes in cigarette consumption (Saffer and Chaloupka 2000). For studies of adolescent smoking, a specific problem with using econometric analyses is that the studies use overall cigarette consumption (all ages) as the outcome variable, and adolescents consume a very small proportion of cigarettes soli Indeed, adolescents likely smoke less than 5% of the cigarettes consumed in the United States, in part because they smoke fewer cigarettes during the stages before or at the beginning of the period when they become addicted (than they do later) (DiFranza and Ubrett 1999).

A study (Keelor et al. 20O4) on the combined effect of advertising and price on cigarette consumption following the Master Settlement Agreement in 1998 analyzed the effect of increases in cigarette prices and relatively large changes in advertising in the years around the settlement and concluded that the increase in advertising and marketing expenditures that occurred immediately before and following the settlement blunted the reduction in consumption that would otherwise have been observed as a result of the price increase. In other words, this analysis documented a simultaneous bolstering of cigarette con-- sumption (2.7-4.7%) as a result of increased marketing expenditures and a relatively greater downward movement in consumption that was driven by price (-83%). The authors state:

Results show that the increase in cigarette prices stemming from the Settlement reduced per capita cigarette consumption in the USA by 8,3%. However, the cigarette companies also increased advertising in the years immediately preceding and following the Settlement This study estimates that this increased advertising partially offsets the effects of the higher prices, increasing cigarette consumption by 2,7 to 4.7%, and hence blunting the effects of the price increase by 33-57% (Keelor et al. 2004, p. 1623).

Lewit and colleagues (1981) were able lo avoid some of the kmitarjora in econometric analyses of the impact of advertising on youth smoking in their study of the link between cigarette advertising on television in the late 1960s (such advertising ended on January 2,1971} and the level of adolescent smoking. These authors analysed a series of annual surveys with 12- to 17-year-olds from 1966 to 1970, when television was the. dominant medium for tobacco advertisers, and found a significant relationship between the level of exposure to tobacco advertising on television for the 12 months before each measurement of tobacco usage and the likelihood of being a current smoker at the measurement point Holding all other factor* constant, for-fcvery IQ-hou rs per week- the-adofescent-watched television (and so, tobacco advertising) in Lhe previous year, he or she was 11% more likely to be a current smoker. This study is valuable because, once adult smoking is established as a result of nicotine addiction, it is unlikely that one would see large changes in smoking behavior as a function of year-to-year changes in the level of advertising. Smoking patterns were more changeable, in contrast, in the adolescents Lewit and colleagues studied (Goldberg 2008).

Another way to evaluate the effect of advertising on overall cigarette consumption is to use econometric or time-series techniques to investigate whether bans on advertising and promotion lead to a reduction in cigarette consumption. The studies in this area have generally found that partial baas have a much smaller impact on cigarette consumption, primarily because marketing dollars flow to other outlets for advertising and promotion that are not regulated or banned Total bans on advertising and promotion, in contrast, have been associated with a reduction in ugarette consumption. An econometric analysis of 22 Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries by Saffer and Cha-loupka (2000) reported a potential 7.4% reduction in cigarette consumption if all OECD countries had enacted a comprehensive ban on advertising and promotion. The findings of Braverman and Aan* (2004) reinforce the conclusions of Saffer and Chaloupka and the importance of

a comprehensive ban on all tobacco marketing. More recently, Blechcr (2008) evaluated the impact of bans on tobacco advertising in developing countries and concluded lhat both partial and complete advertising restrictions are effective in reducing tobacco consumption, with complete bans being more effective, and that bans in developing countries may be even more effective in reducing tobacco use than are bans in developed countries.

A few studies, Itowever; have concluded that there is no evidence that advertising bans affect cigarette consumption or die prevalence of smoking among youth. For example, Uncaster and Lancaster (2003) concluded that there is no evidence of an effect of bans directed at marketing expenditures and advertising on the consumption of cigarettes. Nelson (2003a) has even suggested that advertising may reduce the consumption of cigarettes because of (I) theaddition of the cost of advertising to the price of a pack of cigarettes and (2) the communication through advertising of mandatory health warnings on the cigarette packs; he states, "laldvertising...increases the cost of cigarettes and many advertisements contain mandated health warnings. Thus, a ban of advertising could increase consumption by reducing prices or reducing awareness of health risks" (p. 1). Tn contrast to Nelson's assertion, there is some evidence (Tremblay and Tremblay 1999) tliat advertising bans raise4he-nwket power- of-existing-firms by creating entry barriers; as a result, competition is reduced and prices arc higher. Elsewhere, Nelson (2003b) reported no relatioaship between restrictions on advertising and the prevalence of adolescent smoking by using prevalence of smoking at a single point in lime ralher than from multiple points over time, which is more typical of econometric or time-series analyses.

In addition to methodologic issues, the validity of these studies has been questioned because some were sponsored by the tobacco industry. Industry efforts lo undermine the existing science on the health effects of smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke is well-documented (e.�, see Warner 1991; Bero et al, 1993,1994, 1995, 2001, 2005; Bero and Glantz 1993; Barnes et al., 1995; Glantz etal. 1996; Barnes and Bero 1997,1998; Kennedy and Bero 1999; Hirschhorn 2000; Ong and Glantz 2000,2001; Bialous and Yach 2001; Dropc and Chapman 2001; Hirschhorn et al. 2001; Muggli et al, 2001; Cunja et al. 2002; Hong and Bern 2002,2006; Tong and Glantz 2004; Bitton et al. 2005; Game et al. 2005; Landman et aL 2008).

In conclusion, econometric studies arc notthe most sensitive way to assess the influence of tobacco advertising on adolescent smoking. However, these studies generally provide support for a finding lhat the marketing of tobacco promotes its use by adolescents.

Changes in the Initiation of Smoking and Consumption of Cigarettes Among Adolescents

The previous section presented data from econometric analyses to evaluate the impact of advertising and promotion on overall consumption (i.e., all ages, children and adults combined) as well as their effects on youth, Other literature has examined whether advertising and promotion are associated with increased cigarette consumption among adolescents in both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. As shown below, both lines of inquiry demonstrate the influence of tobacco marketing.

Cross-sectional studies have associated adolescent smoking with awareness of cigarette advertisements and promotions, recognition and approval of such ads, and exposure and receptivity to them (Armstrong et al. 1990; Aitken ct aL 1991; Evans et al. 1995; Schooler et al. 1996; Gilpin et al. 1997). These studies also found among adolescents a relatioaship between receipt or ownership of a promotional cigarette item and (1) a feeling that cigarette advertising may make them want to smoke a cigarette and (2) actual smoking status.

Several longitudinal studies have examined the relationship between exposure to cigarette marketing and subsequent changes in adolescent smoking behavior while controlling for possible confounding factors. In one, a prospective study by Pierce aMcoilcagues"{ California adolescents who had never smoked, the authors found that those who had a favorite cigarette advertisement, or who possessed or were willing to use a cigarette promotional item, were significantly more likely to progress toward smoking as marked by increased susceptibility and greater intention to smoke than were thaw with neither of these characteristics. Pierce and associates (1998) estimated that, in 1993, 34% of experimentation with smoking by adolescents in California could be attributed to tobacco advertising and marketing.

A few years later, Choi and colleagues (2002) studied the smoking status in 3996 of nearly 1,000 California adolescents who had experimented with smoking in 1993. As in the previous studies, this study found that exposure to marketing increased the likelihood that adolescents would progress to established smoking. Although having peers who smoked and poor relationships wilh family members were both associated with progression to established smoking, the strongest predictor was related to the effects of cigarette marketing. Specifically, the authors found that adolescents who were willing to use a promotional item and who believed they could quit at any lime progressed to established smoking at a higher rate ($2%) than adolescents who did not believe they could quit smoking at any time and were minimally or moderately receptive to advertising (20-25%).

Additional longitudinal studies on adolescents outside of California have produced similar results. For example, Biener and Siegel (2000), who surveyed Massachusetts adolescents in 1993 and resurveyed them in 1997, found a significant relationship between the combination of owning a promotional tobacco item and having a favorite cigarette advertisement and subsequent smoking. In this study, the odds of becoming an established smoker were more than twice as great for those with both characteristics as they were for those with neither. Also in New England, a longitudinal study of a cohort of rural Vermont students that collected baseline data in 1996 and conducted follow-up in 1997 and 1996 revealed that being receptive to cigarette advertising (as indicated by owning or being willing to own an item promoting cigarettes) at baseline was associated with higher smoking rates 18 months later (Sargent et al, 2000). After controlling for possible confounders, the authors found the probability of initiating smoking was nearly double fur those adolescents who were receptive to advertising compared with those who were not receptive (odds ratio [OR) - 1.9; 95% confidence interval [CM, 1.3-2.9).

In a longitudinal investigation conducted in California after the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, Gilpin and colleagues (2007) compared two cohorts of 12- to

gar-oldadolescents,c other in 1906. Both cohorts were reassessed 3 and 6 years later as young adults. Although there were more young adult established smokers in the 1993 cohort than in the 1996 group, the two groups exhibited the same relationship between receptivity to tobacco advertising and smoking. In both, having a favorite cigarette advertisement and owning or being willing to use a tobacco promotional item increased the adjusted odds of future young adult smoking (OR = 1.46; 95% CI, tl-1.9; OR -1.84; 95% CI, 1.2-2.9, respectively).

Pierce and colleagues (2010) also assessed whether cigarette advertising campaigns conducted after the 1998 settlement continued to influence smoking among adoles-cents. The authors used a national longitudinal cohort of boys and girls who were 10-13 years old when they were enrolled in 2003 and asked the brand of their "favorite* cigarette advertisement (if they had one). The fifth interview with this cohort was conducted after the start of RJR's "Camel No. 9" advertising campaign in 2007. Youth who reported any favorite cigarette ad at baseline (mean age = 11.7 years) were 50% more likely to have smoked by 2008 (adjusted OR - 1.5; 95% CI, 10-2.3). For boys, the proportion with a favorite ad was stable over all five interviews, as it was for girls across the first four surveys, which were conducted before the start of the "Camel No. 9" campaign. After the start of that campaign, the proportion of girls who reported a favorite ad increased by

10 percentage points, to 44%. The Camel brand appears to have accounted for almost all of this increase. (The proportion of each gender that nominated the Marlboro brand remained stable.) These findings suggest that after the Master Settlement Agreement, cigarette advertising continues lo reach adolescents, that adolescents continue to be responsive to cigarette advertising, ami that those who are responsive are more likely to initiate smoking.

In summary, the literature on tobacco marketing and the initiation of .smoking by adolescents demonstrates the continued presence of this marketing and its effect on adolescent smoking at the individual level. It is important to note that, in the TT1 framework, influence at the individual level also translates to distal-level factors (Figure 5.1). Specifically, as more individuals use tobacco, they continue to influence social groups and the cultural norms for nonsmoking adolescents.

Changes in Brand Preference

In 199.1, DiKranza and colleagues published the first wide-coverage study of brand recognition among youth (DiFranza el al. 1991). As discussed in more detail in the next section, having a favorite brand provides another measure of receptivity to advertising that predicts smoking behavior among youth.

.....      In 1^99^1FeKaTcTfef"s")n ^lassacriusenT who"stucF"

ied the relationship among adolescents (aged 12-15 at baseline), between the magnitude of brand-specific cigarette advertising in magazines in 1993 and brand-specific smoking behavior 4 years later among the same group found strong, significant correlations between exposure to brand-specific advertising and the brand these young people started smoking and the brand they currently smoked (Pucci and Siegel 1999).

Elsewhere, analyses of brand-specific advertising patterns in magazines revealed that those brands disproportionately preferred by adolescents were more likely to be advertised in magazines with a higher proportion of youth readers (King et al. 1998). Similarly, in these magazines, the tobacco companies were more likely to advertise cigarette brands most popular among youth than to advertise the range of adult brands (King ct al. 1098).

Tobacco companies are very interested in initial brand preference because they know it is highly associated with subsequent brand selection. The tobacco companies know that youth arc very brand loyal, and once they have chosen a brand, most will continue with it For example, a previously confidential Phifip Morris document states as its "underlying premise* that The smokers you have are the smokers you are most likely to keep* (Peters 1999, Bates No. 2070648930/8964, p. 25).

Among the other tobacco industry documents confirming the importance of brand loyalty among youth is a 1984 RJR Secret Strategic Research Keport subtitled "Younger Adult Smokers: Strategies and Opportunities" that observed:

Once a hrand becomes well-developed among younger adult smokers, aging arid brand loyalty will eventually transmit that strength to older age brackets....Thus, even if a brand falls from favor among younger adult smokers, the younger adults it attracted in earlier years and their increasing consumption can carry the brand's market share for years, significantly extending its overall life cycle (Burrows 1984, Bates No. 501928462/8550, p. 11,13).

The success of Philip Morris' Marlboro brand was the major catalyst for the creation by its rival, RJR, of the Camel campaign. Specifically, RJtt's marketing plan showed that it sought to "build preference by leveraging Camel's appeal among adult smokers 18-34 years of age, particularly those with an 'irreverent, less serious' mind set, gradually breaking down the pervasive peer acceptance of Marlboro" (Young & Rubicam 1990, Bates No. -508827386/7401, pJa), Accor4ing4o RJR's 1991 communication, the strategy was to catch Marlboro smokers' attention through the Joe Camel persona:

Joe is the hero in all of CAMEL's communications. But he's not a spokesman, a salesman, or a shill. He is the larger-than-life personification of all that we, in our moments of playful fantasy, aspire to be. Always the winner, on top of the situation, beating the system, and covering the scene, whatever he does he does with a style and joie de vivre all his own. The twinkle in his eye and that 'cat that ate the canary* expression on his face say it all (Young & Rubicam 1990, Bates No. 50882738677401, p. 11).

Companies continue to profile their customers and compare them with their competitors1 customers, particularly their younger ones (Ling and Giants 2002; United States v. Philip Morris USA, 449 R Supp, 2d 1,1006 (D.D.C. 2006]).

tobacco marketing on smoking beliaviors among adolescents. Because the review found that experimental studies on the effect of marketing on adolescent smoking behavior could not ethically or practically be conducted, the authors relied on longitudinal studies, nine of which met theiT acceptance criteria. These studies were conducted in Australia, England, Spain, and the United States between 1983 and 2000. The authors concluded:

longitudinal studies consistently suggest that exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion is associated with the likelihood thai adolescents will start to smoke. Based on the strength of this association, the consistency ot findings across numerous observational studies, temporality of exposure and smoking behaviours observed, as well as the theoretical plausibility regarding the impact of advertising, we conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke (Lovato el al. 2003, p. 2).

The authors also noted that the cross-sectional studies that were considered (they viewed longitudinal studies as being stronger) also supported I lie conclusion that advertising-influences adol^coitsta bcair^wioho^U^o^tu^ aL200S).

In another systematic review of the existing literature on tobacco industry marketing and smoking by adolescents, DiFranza and colleagues (2006) arrived at several major conclusions that support the conclusion that marketing by the tobacco industry causes adolescents to smoke. First, there is a dose-response relationship between exposure to tobacco marketing and initiation of tobacco use by adolescents. Second, exposure to tobacco marketing precedes initiation of tobacco use. Third, across a wide variety of promotion types, populations, and research designs, the evidence clearly points to a causal relationship between promotion by the tobacco industry and adolescent tobacco use. Finally, the scientific literature provides an understanding of the mechanisms by which tobacco marketing influences tobacco use among adolescents.

NCI's tobacco control rncnugraph^ jjje {fyfe of the Media m Promoting and Reducing Tbbacco Use (NCI 2008), also examined the evidence on how tobacco marketing efforts affect tobacco use among adolescents. Using numerous studies and tobacco industry documents, the report concluded that even brief exposure to tobacco advertising influences attitudes and perceptions about smoking and adolescents' intentions to smoke. In addition, the evidence showed that exposure to cigarette

advertising influences nonsmoking adolescents to begin smoking and move toward regular smoking.

The Position and Behavior of the Tobacco Industry

The tobacco companies have consMently denied that their marketing efforts have had any effect on the smoking behavior of adolescents and contend instead that the sole purpose of marketing by individual companies has been to influence existing adult smokers to smoke the company's brands of cigarettes rather than those of a competitor, In addition, the industry has claimed that there is no evidence that cigarette marketing affects the smoking behavior of youth and that the definitive study on this matter has not yet been conducted. This section reviews the evidence on the industry's position regarding the purpose of marketing and the industry's actual behavior in using imagery to appeal to youth.

The Tobacco Industry's Position on the Purpose of Marketing: Switching of Brands by Adults

Tobacco companies have consistently stated that

.........tne.....'PMrposc-trf'Spentttng.....nitttons.......uf.....dollarsonci&iTGttc

marketing is to attract and hold current adult smokers to their brands of cigarettes (Tye et al. 1987). In addition, the companies deny that marketing campaigns are intended to increase demand for cigarettes among existing smokers or to encourage young people to initiate smoking (Cum-mings et al. 2002). The economic value of the amount of brand switching that occurs, however, does not justify the magnitude of marketing expenditures (Tyeetal. 1987;Sie-gel et al. 1994). Indeed, because roost brands are owned by a few tobacco companies, most switching of brands would not have a substantial impact on any one company's profits. The most plausible justification for advertising expenditures at the levels that have been observed would be to attract new customers to generate a long-term cash flow for the companies (Tye et al. 1987). In addition, the nature of the imagery used in tlw advertisements clearly appeals to the aspirations of adolescents, suggesting tiwtt they are a target (Perry 1999).

Across industries, marketing is intended to sell existing products and to facilitate the introduction of new ones into the marketplace. In 1986, Emerson Foote, former chief executive officer (CEO) and founder of McOann-Erickson, a global advertising agency, said,

The cigarette industry has been artfully maintaining that cigarette advertising has nothing

to do with total sales. This is complete and utter nonsense. The industry knows it is nonsense.... I am always amused by the suggestion that advertising, a function that has ken shown to increase consumption of virtually every other product, somehow miraculously fails to work for tobacco products (Poote 1981, p. 1668).

The tobacco industry aggressively pursues market' ing strategies to build national and global brands geared toward young adults (Cohen 2000; Hafez and Ling 2005). RJR based Joe Camel on a popular French campaign depicting a stylized French cartoon camel (Cohen 2000) that was appealing to a younger audience Philip Morris' strategy for Marlboro encompassed three principal foci: psychographic segmentation, brand studies, and advertLsing/cnmmurucalion (Hafez and ling 2005). The company's strategy now appears to be translated into a standardised global strategy.

Despite the industry's arguments about brand loyalty and inducing existing smokers to switch brands, there are times when cigarette company executives themselves have acknowledged that marketing reaches and influences underage adolescents. For example, in 1997, Bennett S. LeBow, CEO of the holding company that owns Uggett, jtatedi.t'Liggett acknowledges that-tho tobacco industry markets to 'youuYi which means those under 18 years of age, and not just those 18-24 years of age" (LeBow 1907b, BalesNo.VDOJ31357/1375,p.6).

Later that year, in litigation in Minnesota, Mr. I *How further testified that cigarette companies targeted young people "to try to keep people smoking, keep their business going"* (1-eBow 1997a, Bates No. LG031269673542, p. 343), Draper Daniels, who first created the Marlboro man for Philip Morris, wrote in his 1974 book entitled GIANTS, pigmies, AND OTHER ADVERTISING PEOPLE,

...successful cigarette advertising involves showing the kind of people most people would like to be, doing the kind of thing most people would like to do, and smoking up a storm. 1 don't know any way of doing this that doesn't tempt young people to smoke, and in view of present knowledge, this is something I prefer not to do (Daniels 1974, p. 245).

After Harley-Davidson USA, a manufacturer of motorcycles, had licensed its name to Lorillard Tobacco Company for a cigarette brand to be called Harley-Davidson, the company expressed its concern about cigarette advertising to Lorillard in a letter dated August 17,

1993. Timothy K. Hoelter, vice president and general counsel for Harley-Davidsoa, wrote to Ronald S. Cold-brenner, associate general counsel of Lorillard, stating, "The recent California and PTC attacks on the Joe Camel advertising campaign are alarming and compel us to be sure that our Property will not be used to recruit underage smokers, intentionally or otherwise (Hoelter 1993, Bates Ko. 91058719/8720, p. 1). Mr. Hoelter went on to state: "We need to know what ads will be usttd, in what publications and on what billboards. Tins will help us assess the likelihood that children may be targets or so close to the intended targets as to be 'in harm's way"' (Bates No. 91058719/8720, p. 2),

Fallowing correspondence from Lorillard, Harley-Davidson commissioned a firm with expertise in child behavior to conduct an independent study of the likely appeal of Lorillard s promotional campaign to children, The research firm conducted focus groups, group discussions, individual interviews, and telephone surveys and concluded that "Lorillard's intended promotional campaign for Harley-Davidson cigarettes would appeal to... children who are below the legal age to buy or smoke cigarettes" (Harley-Davidson 1993, Bates No. 93791722/1760, p. 30, 33). Tn addition, in legal filings Harley-Davidson noted that "Lorillard continued to refuse to reveal its test data-and analysis about the Ukely^ffects^ts-promotmnal-campaign, and Harley-Davidson inferred that the withheld data and analysis would have suggested possible or likely recruitment of underage persons" (Ilarley-Davidson 1993, Rates No. 93791722A760, p. 34). As a result, the Harlcy-Davidson campaign was not developed.

In a 1983 confidential report, RJR emphasized the importance of "younger adults" to the industry as a whole:

Why, then, are younger adult smokers important to RJR? Younger adults are the only source of replacement smokers. Repeated government studies (Appendix B) have shown that;

�   l^ess than one-third of smokers (31%) start after age 13.

�   Only 5% of smokers start after age 24. Thus, today's younger adult smoking behavior will largely determine the trend of Industry volume over the next several decades. If younger adults turn away from smoking, the Industry must decline, just as a population which does not give birth will eventually dwindle. In such an erivjj-ojur^n^ a positive RJR sales trend would require disproportionate share gains and/or steep price increases (which could depress volume) (RJR 1983b, Bates No. 503473660/3665, p. ,1).

Imagery

As is the case with all advertising, a substantial portion of tobacco advertising consists of imagery that conveys little factual information about tJ\e characteristics of the product. In effect, tobacco advertising fulfills many of the aspirations of young people by effectively using themes of independence, liberation, attractiveness, adven-turousness, sophistication, glamour, athleticism, social acceptability and inclusion, sexual attractiveness, thinness, popularity, rebelliousness, and being "cool" (United States it, Pttitip Morris USA, 449F. Supp. 2d 1,980 [D.D.C. 2006); NCI 2008).

The use of Joe Camel is an exemplar for understanding the importance of imageiy to reposition a brand for a younger age group. RJR conducted extensive studies on initiation of smoking by adolescents and factors behind the choice of their first brand (Cohen 2000), This research was geared toward repositioning Camel for a younger market, or as is said in the RJR documents, "youthening" the brand (Carpenter 1985, Bates No. 506768857, p. 1).

In fact, RJR's documents are replete with references to the importance of imagery in reaching the Camel target market, including comments such as the following:

In order to stimulate {younger adult smokers] to think about t)farlia~aIfernativcsV the""advertising and brand personality must 'jolt' the target consumer. Since CAMRL does not have a demonstrably different or unique product (rational) benefit to sell, this jolt needs to be based on an emotional response and is unlikely to he accomplished with advertising which looks conventional or traditional. Studies have shown that the so-called l^ot buttons' for younger adults include some of the following themes: Escape into imagination.... Excittment/run is success: Younger adults center their lives on having fun in every way possible and at every time possible. Their definition of success is 'enjoying today' which differenDates them from older smokers (RJR 1986a, Bates No. 506768775/8784, p. 9).

A 1988 Lorillard study entitled "Newport Image Study" concluded that "in all areas Newport smokers were viewed as party-goers, those that do their own tiling and larel nm�4oving" and "in all areas Newport smokers were viewed younger and more fun-loving than Kool and Salem smokers3* (Lorillard 1988, Bates No. 92272605^665, p. 48). A 1991 Lorillard "Newport 1992 Strategic Marketing Plan* discussed the importance of the "Alive with Pleasure1* advertising campaign, coupled with price promotions, to "generate interest and trial among entry

level smokers" (Lorillard 1991, Bates No. 92011118/1156, p. 20). In addition, the industry capitalized on themes of rebellion to attract younger customers. For example, a report for an RJR Canadian subsidiary described young male smokers as "going through a stage where they are seeking to express their independence and individuality [smokingl (Poilay 1989, p. 240). In another document, it was noted that "Export A... appeals to their rebellious nature..." (Ness Motley 1982, Bates No. 80005728677321, p. 14). Moreover, a 1978 MW document slated, "Imagery will continue to be important in brand selection for teenagers* (B&W 1978, Bates No. 667007711/7714, p. 1). These efforts to encourage brand loyalty by building brand image are particularly relevant for youth and young adults. Tobacco lifestyle-oriented marketing messages targeting young males have served to connect tobacco brand image with the user's self image and simultaneously portray risk-taking behavior as a normal part of masculinity (Cortese and ling 2011). As previously discussed, the "Camel No. 9* campaign theme is geared to young women (Pierce et al.2010). In addition, RJR employed a campaign geared toward young adult social trendsetters, who are commonly referred to as "hipsters" (Mendlin ct al. 2010).

The Interplay Between Cigarette Marketing and -fieerJbaessure_~------------------------------------------

The relationships between social relationships and youth smoking are well established through previous research and reviews, including the 1994 Surgeon General's report on preventing tobacco use among young people (USI)HHS 1994). That report summarised the particularly strong association between smoking by siblings and peers and initiation of smoking among youth. The relationship between adolescents' perceptions and their use of tobacco is also well documented. As demonstrated in both cross-sectional and prospective longitudinal studies, the perceptions of youth about their social environment, including peer norms, perceived cultural norms, and perceived parental expectations, strongly predict smoking in this age group (Chasm et al. 198fi; Conrad et aL 1992; USDHHS 1994).

Peer and parental influences are both associated with the decision of an adolescent to begin smoking, but it is important to understand the relationship between initiation of smoking and peer influence. Peer influence is a factor that has been consistently demonstrated to affect the onset and maintenance of smoking. As discussed earlier and in Chapter 4, it is also important to consider that, to the extent that tobacco industry marketing and promotional activities stimulate peers and parents to smoke, these influences contribute to smoking by adolescents  (USDHHS  1994).  Therefore,  peer  and

parental influences are acting as mediating variables between advertising and adolescent smoking. Thus, including peer influence only as an independent variable in studies that otamine the direct effect of cigarette advertising on adolescent smoking will lead to an underestimate of the total {direct and indirect, mediated by peer smoking) effect of cigarette advertising and oilier protoliacco media influences, such as exposure to on-screen smoking in movies (Wills et al 2007,2008; Lmg et al. 2009),

Young people want to be popular, to be seen as individuals by Iheir friends, and to resemble those they most admire. Cigarette advertising exploits these adolescent desires, using imagery to create the impression of popularity, individuality, and kinship. There is substantial evidence that advertising of tobacco affects adolescents' perceptions of the attractiveness and pervasiveness of smoking, and the weight of the evidence suggests mat cigarette marketing, particularly image-based advertising, and peer influence lave additive effects on adolescent smoking (USI)HHS 1994). A study by Evans and colleagues (1995) in California that examined the relationship between exposure of adolescents to tobacco marketing and susceptibility to smoking also examined such factors as smoking by peers and family and perceived school performance. In this study, tobacco marketing increased the

wlity-of-adofase&Rls-to smoking in a way that was^--independent of eiposure to friends or family who smoked. When combined, minimal exposure to tobacco marketing and exposure to other smokers increased the likelihood of susceptibility to smoking fourfold (Evans ct al. 1995).

Additional research has examined the intricate relationships between tobacco marketing, peer relationships, and adolescent smoking behavior. Specifically, tobacco marketing may affect the selection of peer groups, which, in turn, influence smoking behavior among adolescents. Pechmann and Knight (2002) reported the results of a randomized experiment that compared two conditions: eiposure to cigarette ads (vs. nonxigarette ads) and exposure ' to peers who smoked (vs. peers who did not smoke). Both exposure to cigarette ads and peers who smoked had main effects on adolescents* positive stereotypes of smokers and intentions to smoke. When considered concurrently, however, the data revealed a mediation relationship for cigarette ads. Specifically, the significant influence of cigarette advertising on intentions to smoke became nonsignificant when positive stereotypic beliefs about smokers were considered, suggesting that cigarette ads increase favorable attitudes about smokers, which increase an adolescent's intention and susceptibility to smoke. These results also provide support for the idea that tobacco advertising affects adolescent smoking across multiple levels of influence (Deighton 1984; Pechmann 2001; Pechmann and Knight 2002). Advertising primes positive attitudes and

beliefs about smokers; as Leventbal and Keesban (1993) observed, adolescents may then be drawn to peers who smoke and who mirror those positive attitudes primed by advertisements. The idea that adolescents choose their peer group on the basis of their attitudes about smoking and their smoking behavior has been supported by numerous studies that aim to explain the homogeneity of peer groups (Ennett and Bauman 1994; Engels et al. 1997; Kobus 2003; de Vries et al, 2006; Merckcn et al. 2007).

The preceding studies demonstrate the importance of two processes underlying the role that peers play in adolescent smoking; socialization and selection. Peers who smoke socialize the nonsmoking members of a social network by increasing perceptions of the prevalence of smoking, by modeling the behavior, and through the process of peer acceptance. Adolescents who believe smoking to be prevalent are more likely to smoke (Chassin et al. 1984; Sussman et al. 1988; Botvin et al. 1993). Moreover, adolescents who hold positive beliefs about smokers or who smoke themselves choose peers who affirm those beliefs and attitudes that were primed by tobacco marketing. In this regard, tobacco marketing, socialization, and the selection of friends contribute to a dynamic system that serves to increase adolescent smoking social networks (Kobus 2003). From internal industry documents,- -deposifionsrand-hf ial- testjmGnyr4fe-is-eJfcar-the tobacco industry understands the need to be accepted, particularly among youth, and has attempted to exploit this need through its marketing efforts. For example, in a 1984 report, a Philip Morris scientist stated that

...we need not try to understand why young people have a herd instinct. From their choices of food, clothes, transportation, entertainment, heroes, friends, hangouts, etc., it is clear (hat they do. More important to us (and probably to many other product categories) is why they make certain choices instead of others (Tindall 1984, Bates No. 2001265000/5045, p. 28).

In a deposition for the US, Department of Justice case, Nancy ft. Lund, a Philip Morris executive, testified ".. .at least what we know about young adult smokers, for some of them, the fact that Marlboro is a popular brand may be a factor in why they choose Marlboro" (Philip Morris USA 2004a, Bates No. 5001054172/4245, p. 35). A 1998 confidential document of Leo Burnett (Philip Moms' advertising agency that developed the Marlboro Man) recommended adding camaraderie (peer appeal) to the core values of Marlboro Country (Philip Morris USA 1998). As recently as 1999, a Philip Morris "National Market Structure Study" reported, "The attributes associated with brand choices are very different from those stated

to be important - popularity is key" (Philip Morris USA 1999b, Bates No. 2702700028B/00288P, p. 12), Plans by Philip Morris to market its Parliament cigarettes to 1ft- to 24-year-olds in 1987 included the following statement:

This younger age group is more likely to make decisions based on peer pressure. To convey the idea that everyone is smoking Parliament, the brand should have continuous high levels of visibility in as many pack outlets as possible (Philip Morris USA 1987, Bates No, 2045287048/7092, p. 16).

Heavy exposure leads to overestimates of smoking prevalence among adolescents, and this is understood to be a significant risk factor in leading adolescent to smoke (Botvin et at 1993).

Philip Morris was not the only company to understand the importance of peer pressure and its relevance to marketing campaigns. RJR studied the success of Marlboro and attributed some of that success to peer acceptance. A 1966 RJR document stated, "Marlboro's key strength relates to peer acceptability and belonging.... Marlboro is perceived by younger adult smokers as a brand which provides a sense of belonging to the peer group" (RJR 1986a, 3rpr 7), In a. 1986 RJR document -about the Joe Camel campaign, vice president for marketing R.T, Caufieid stated:

Overall, CAMEL advertising will be directed toward using peer acceptance/influence to provide the motivation for target smokers to select CAMEL (Caufieid 1986, Bates No. 503969238/9242, p.)}.

In another example, this one from 1984, in developing marketing materials for its upcoming Tempo brand, RJR characterized the target group as

...extremely influenced by their peer group... influenced by the brand choice of their friends. Third Family (the code name for Tempo) will differentiate itself from competitive brands by major usage of imagery which portrays the positive social appeal of peer group acceptance. Third Family imagery portrays relaxing and enjoyable social interaction where acceptance by the group provides a sense of belonging and security (J. Walter Thompson 1984, Bates No, TCA13320/3333, p. 5),

Pollay observed in an article published in 2000; "Put briefly, it seems that TEMPO'S advertising was too trendy

and heavy handed in its style and deployment, becoming transparently interested in a youthful market This backfired because adolescents are decidedly disinterested in symbols of adolescence, wanting symbols of the adulthood they aspire to" (Pollay 2000, p. 143).

Evidence of the industry's understanding in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s of die importance of peer approval for adolescent smoking behavior is widespread and well documented. Proceeding from this understanding, marketing campaigns tried to emphasize the popularity of brands, hoping this would translate to their being perceived as more popular among peers. Two passages from the RJR Secret Strategic Research Report subtitled 'Younger Adult Smokers: Strategies and Opportunities* are illustrative: "Marlboro's key imagery was not masculinity, it was younger adult identity/belonging" and "This could mean as social pressures tend to isolate younger adult smokers from their nonsmoking peers, they have an increased need to identify with their smoking peers, to smoke the 'belonging' brand" (Burrows 1984, Bates No, 501928462/8550, p. 28).

LoriUard considered Newport to be its "peer brand" among young adult smokers (Brooks 1993; Lorlilard 1993h), and a 1999 creative strategy it used with the intention of increasing volume and gaining long-term growth --was-to------------------------...........-.......-----------------------

Develop creative, executions that continue to strengthen and refresh Newport's advantage as the pe*r brand of choice among younger adult smokers by reinforcing the perception that Newport delivers smoking pleasure in social settings relative to their lifestyles. Continue to leverage the Pleasure campaign equity to reinforce the brand's fun, spontaneous, upbeat image through a variety of settings portraying social interaction, spontaneous fun, refreshment and simiking situations (LoriUard 1999, Bates No. 98196920/6942, P-8).

Judge Kesslcr concluded that

According to Shari Teitelbaum, Philip Morris Director of Marketing and Sales Decision Support, Philip Morris has used the term "herd smoker� to refer to smokers of the most popular cigarette brands, like Marlboro, Camel, and Newport, because these brands attract the largest share of young adult smokers. Herd brands are "the most popular, it's for smokers that would be likely to kind of follow the herd, kind of more of a group mentality type of thing" (United States

Tobacco companies pursued promotions aimed at young adults in bars and nightclubs increasingly through the 1990s (Sepe et aL 2002; Biener et aJ. 2004; Rigotti et al. 2005), in part because these young adults were viewed as trendsetters who were highly likely to influence the behaviors of their peers (Kate and Lavack 2002; Sepe et al. 2002). A study of young adults in California reported approximately 339ft of all young adults go to bars and clubs at least sometimes, and bar and cluh goers had over three times greater odds to be daily smokers and over three times the odds to be social smokers (Cilpin el al. 2005).

Marketing to young adult trendsetters remains important In a relevant study, Hcndlin and colleagues {2010) used tobacco industry documents and analysis of industry marketing materials to understand why and how RJR and other tobacco companies have marketed tobacco products to young adult consumers who are social trendsetters ("hipsters1^ to recruit other trendsetters and average consumers, as well as youth who look to hipsters as role models, to smoke- These authors found that since 1995, when RJR developed its marketing campaigns to better suit the lifestyle, image identity, and attitudes of hip Ipnfjfy hftrt yHy^ly shifted to.

more closely convey the hipster persona. Camel emphasized events such as promotional music tours to link the brand and smoking to activities and symbols appealing to hipsters and their emulating masses.

In sum, far from being a completely independent determinant of youth smoking, peer influence is yet anntlier channel for communication on which the industry can. capitalize to promote smoking by youth. It is important to note that the tobacco industry routinely attributes smoking to peer pressure, but it does not acknowledge the relationship between advertising and peer influence or the effects of advertising on normative behavior and perceptions of popularity and peer acceptance. Tobacco compa-

nies have consistently stated that the purpose of cigarette marketing is to attract and hold current adult smokers to their brands of cigarette, but the evidence reviewed shows that these efforts also affect peer influence to smoke and encourage smoking among young people.

Summary

The continuously accumulating evidence from the studies that have addressed the effect of advertising on smoking is consistent with a dose-dependent causal relationship. Most smokers start as adolescents: cigarette companies need to recruit new smokers from among youth, and their advertising campaigns appeal to the aspirations of adolescents. There is strong empirical evidence that advertising and promotions affect awareness of smoking and of particular brands, the recognition and recall of cigarette advertising, attitudes about smoking, intentions to smoke, and actual smoking behavior. Because youth are brand loyal, attracting them to a particular brand pays off for tobacco companies in the long term. In fact, youth appear to be even more responsive to advertising appeals than are adults (Lovato et at 2003). The industry's own internal correspondence and testimony in court, as well "aywiifcly ai^epteir^rmctfe^of'aJvertising arid marketing, also support the conclusion that tobacco advertising recruits new users as youth and reinforces continued use among young adults,

Taking together the epidemiology of adolescent tobacco use, internal tobacco company documents describing the importance of new smokers, analysis of the design of marketing campaigns, the actual imagery communicated in the $10-billion-a-ycar marketing effort, the conclusions of official government reports, and the weight of the scientific evidence, it is concluded that advertising and promotion has caused youth to start smoking and continue to smoke.

The Tobacco Industry's Pricing Practices and Use ofTobacco Among Young People

In recent years, the pricing of tobacco products has become a key marketing strategy in the tobacco industry. Historically, markets for tobacco products were characterized by relatively stable prices, with changes in prices for one firm typically matched by changes by other firms (Chaloupka 2007). Moreover, price changes in the indus-

522 Chapters

try were infrequent and generally modest with some exceptions. In recent years, however, price-reducing promotions have been the primary means of price com petition among manufacturers, with some evidence that these promotions have been targeted to specific brands or venues that are more important for young people. These

have followed Ihe early econometric research demonstrating that smoking among young people is more responsive to price than is smoking among adults, and this strategy accelerated following the Master Settlement Agreement's constraints on other marketing activities. Internal industry documents show clearly that cigarette companies were paying close attention to the early econometric studies, that the findings from these studies were consistent with the industry's internal research, and that this knowledge

informed their use of price-reducing promotions (Cha~ loupka et al. 2002). In considering the numerous studies demonstrating that tobacco use among young people is responsive to changes in the prices of tohacco products, it can be concluded tliat the industry's extensive use of price-reducing promotions has led to higher rates of tobacco use among young people than would have occurred in the absence of these promotions.

Influence of the Tobacco Industry on Tobacco Use Among Youth: The Packaging of Tobacco Products

Background

Packaging is an integral component of the overall marketing strategy for consumer goods (Slade 1997; Underwood arid Ozanne 1998; Shapiro et al. 1999; Palmer 2000; Pollay 2001; Wakefield et aL 2002a; Dewhirst 2004; FTC 2011a). It is particularly important for products such as cigarettes, which have a high degree of social visibil-'ityTtlrilike many other consumer products, cigarettes are contained hi packages that are displayed each time the product is used and arc often left in public view between uses {Pollay 2001; Wakefield et al. 2002a). Cigarette packages also serve as a "badge" product As John Digianni, a former designer of cigarette packages, noted, "A cigarette package is unique because the consumer carries it around with him all day.... It's a part of a smoker's clothing, and when he saunters into a bar and plunks it down, he makes a statement about himself (Koten 1980, p. 22).

Tobacco Packaging and Brand Appeal

Tobacco packaging seeks to achieve the same general objective as other forms of marketing: to establish brand identity and to promote brand appeal. Research conducted by the tobacco industry consistently demonstrates that the brand imagery portrayed on packages is particularly influential during youth and young adulthood�the period in which smoking behavior and brand preferences develop (DiFraiua et al. 1994; Pollay 2000, 2001; Wakefield et al. 2002a). In many cases, initial brand preferences are based less on the sensory properties of using the product than on perceptions of the package and brand: "one of every two smokers is not able to distinguish in blind (masked)

tests between similar cigarettes....for most smokers and for the decisive group of new, younger smokers, the consumer's dwrce is dictated more by psychological, image factors than by relatively minor differ---entes-in-srnoking- tharaxF-teristics" (British American Tobacco [BAT], n.d., Bates No. 500062147/2159, p. 5). The brand imagery on cigarette packages is effective to the point that large majorities of youth�including nonsmoking youth�demonstrate high levels of recall for leading package designs (Goldberg et al 1995; Pierce et aL 2010).

Historically, a package's color has also helped to segment brands and establish brand identity. For example, silver and gold colors can be used to convey status and prestige, particularly for "premium" brands (Pollay 2001). Red packages and logos cart convey excitement, strength, wealth, and power (Gordon et al 1994; Kindra et al. 1994), while pastel colors are associated with freshness, innocence, and relaxation and arc more common among brands that appeal to females (see example above) (Gordon etal. 1994; Kindra et al, 1994).

Brand descriptors�words that appear on packs and are often incorporated into the brand name�can also promote brand appeal among target groups. For example, "slims" descriptors on packs promote beliefs about smoking and weight control�an important factor in smoking

behavior among young women (USDHHS 2001; Carpenter et al. 2005a), In Canada, research conducted among young women and published m 2010 demonstrated that "slims" brand descriptors are associated with increased brand appeal and stronger beliefs thai smoking is associated with thinness (Doxey and Hammond 2010), Otlwr brand names also capitalize on desirable associations with female fashion and sophistication, including names such as Clamour and Vogue.

Similarly, packaging of smokeless tobacco products can communicate the strength of the product or its brand identity. Internal research conducted for U.S. Smokeless Tobacco revealed that smokeless tobacco users widely associated plastic containers with fruit flavors and youthful beginners. The cardboard/pasteboard and metal on packaging was associated with experienced users. Plastic packaging would have solved some of the problems with the smokeless product (retaining moisture, and freshness), but it was not a viable option for experienced Copenhagen users because the "beginner" perception relating to plastic packaging was so strong (B&W .1984).

Packaging and the Perception of Risk

Tobacco companies have made extensive use of cigarette packages to influence consumer perceptions about the potential risks of their products. A central feature of this strategy has been to use misleading brand descriptors. Words such as "light" and "mild" were ostensibly used in the past to denote flavor and taste, but "light" and "mild" brands were promoted in advertisements as "less harmful" (Polby and Dewhirst 2001; Wakefield et al. 2002a). "Light" and "mild" descriptors were also applied to brands with higher levels of filter ventilation�small holes in cigarette filters (NCI 2001). Not only does fitter ventilation dilute cigarette smoke to produce deceptively low tar and nicotine numbers under machine testing (NCI 2001; Kozlowski and O'Connor 2002), but it also produces "lighter tasting" smoke, which reinforces the misleading descriptors on packages. As a result, considerable proportions of adult smokers believed that "light," "mild," and "low tar" cigarette brands lowered health risk and were less addictive than "regular" or "full flavor* brands (Pol-lay and Dewhirst 2001). Indeed, many health-concerned smokers reported switching to these brands as an alternative to quitting (Gilpin et aL 2002). light* and "mild" descriptors may have also promoted the initiation of smoking among youth; one study found that U.S. youth believed that "light" and "mild" brands had lower health risks and lower levels of addiction than "regular" brand

varieties, beliefs similar to those of adults (Kropp and Halpem-Felsher 2004). Similar findings were produced from an Australian study conducted in 2005 with secondary school students aged 13-15 years of age (Hock et al. 2006). In the study, an estimated 50% of the .students agreed that "light" cigarettes contain less tar than regular cigarettes, 40% believed that "light" cigarettes were less harmful, and approximately 30% believed that "light" cigarettes are easier to quit than regular cigarettes. Overall, the synergistic but subtle effect of brand descriptors, lower emission numhers, and "lighter" tasting smoke have undermined perceptions of health rusk among smokers.

The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (2009) now prohibit the descriptors "light," "mild," or "low" or similar descriptors in tobacco product label, labeling, or advertising unless an FDA order is in effect under the modified risk provisions of the statute. This restriction follows a U.S. Federal District Court ruling in 2006 that the terms "low tar," "light," "ultra light" and "mild" are deceptive (Untied States, v. Philip Moms USA, 449 R Supp. 2d 1,32 ID.D.C. 2006]). To date, more than 50 other countries have prohibited the terms "light," "mild," and "low tar" as part of prohibitions on misleading packaging under Article 11 of the World Health Organi-aation (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Con-^-However7 recent research conducted in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, suggests that prohibiting "light" and "mild" lerms may be insufficient to significantly reduce false beliefs about the risks of different cigarette brands (Borland et al, 2008). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that significant proportions of adult smokers and youth in countries such as the United Kingdom continue to reiwrt false beliefs about the relative risk of leading cigarette brands (Hammond ct al. 2009).

One potential explanation for these findings is the wide range of other descriptors that remain in use, including words such as "smooth" and color descriptors such as "silver" and "blue" (Hammond 2009a). Studies conducted in Canada and the United Kingdom after the removal of "light" and "mild* descriptors suggest that replacement words such as "smooth" have the same misleading effect as 'light" and "mild"; as many as one-half of adults and youth in tiiese studies reported that a brand labeled "smooth" would have lower risk than its "regular" counterpart (Hammond and Parkinson 2000; Hammond et aL 2009). In the United States, the names of colors are among the most common replacement descriptors for the terms "light" and "mild." For example, major brands, such as Marlboro, have used "gold" and "silver" to replace "light" and "ultralight," respectively. This same approach has been used by manufacturers in Canada, the European Union, and in other jurisdictions that have prohibited

"light" and "mild" descriptors. From three recent studies that examined consumers' perceptions of color descriptors in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Hammond and Parkinson 2009; Hammond et al. 2009; Bansal-Travers and Hammond 2010), it appears that consumers perceive the color descriptors in the same way as the "light" and "mild" descriptors they replaced. For example, in one study more than three-quarters of U.S. adults surveyed indicated that a brand labeled as "silver" would have lower levels of tar and less health risk than a "rail flavor" brand (Bansal-Travers and Hammond 2010).

The persistence of false beliefs regarding level of risk may also be due to brand imagery md Ihe color of packs (Pollay 2001; Wakefield ct al. 2002a). Tobacco industry documents describe this phenomenon: "Lower delivery products tend to be featured in blue packs. Indeed, as one moves down the delivery sector, then the closer to white a pack tends to become. This is because white is generally held to convey a clean healthy association* (Miller 1986, Bates No. 105364841/4951, p. 2). Changing the shade of the same color and adjusting the proportion of white space on the package are commonly used to influence perceptions of a product's strength and potential risk. Indeed, a number of industry studies have shown that the color and design of the package actually influ-iptions-ffflrfl-sm�king a cigarette, a pro~ cess known as "sensory transfer" (Wakefield et al. 2002a). For example, when consumers smoke cigarettes placed in lighter-colored packs, they may perceive these cigarettes to taste "lighter" and (ess harsh than the identical cigarettes placed in darker-colored packs.

The colors of the packages and the brand descriptors they carry have also been closely integrated with the design of the cigarette. Although terms such as "light" and "mild" may have been arbitrary, they were typically applied to brands with greater filter ventilation. Package descriptors and the designs of Ihe cigarettes reinforce the lighter" taste of these brands ami the lower tar numbers in ways that promote the belief that they are less harmful, despite evidence to the contrary (NCI 2001).

Plain (or Standardized) Packaging

Research on the removal of brand imagery on packages�so-called plain packaging�provides another source of evidence on the impact of brand appeal among youth (Freeman et al. 2007). Under a requi rement for plain packaging, the appearance of cigarette packages would be standardized through the removal of all brand imagery, including corporate logos and trademarks (see example at right). Packages would display a standard background

color, and manufacturers would be permitted to print only the brand name in a mandated size, font, and position. Other government-mandated information, such as health warnings, would remain.

Plain packaging has several poteutial effects. First, it enhances the effectiveness of health warnings by increasing their noticeability, recall, and believabiiity (Beede and 1-awscn 1992; Goldberg et al. 1995,1999; Hammond 2009a; Hammond et al. 2009). For example, in one study, New Zealand youth were significantly more likely to recall health warnings on plain packs than warnings on "normal" branded packages (Beede and Lawson 1992).

Second, plain packaging has the potential to reduce the level of false beliefs about the harmfulness of different wanik-Recent research sugge lions of youth and adults hold false beliefs that one brand is less harmful or easier to quit than another (Hammond and Parkinson 2009; Hammond et al 2009). A 2009 study conducted among adult smokers and youth (both smokers and nonsmokers) in the United Kingdom found that when asked to compare varieties of cigarettes from eight different brands, 75% of jarticipants falsely reported differences in risk between at least two of the varieties (Hammond et al. 2009). Removing the color and brand imagery from packages significantly reduced these beliefs. Plain packaging has also been shown to reduce beliefs about the link between smoking and weight control. In a 2010 study conducted among young women in Canada, women who viewed eight female-oriented packs with colors, such as pink, were significantly more likely to report that smoking "helps people stay slim" than women who viewed "plain" versioas of the same packs (Doxey and Hammond 2010). Third, plain packaging makes smoking less appealing. Research to date suggests that plain packages are less attractive and engaging than normal "branded" packs and may reduce the appeal of smoking among both youth and adults (Trachtenherg 1987; Northrup and Pollard 1995; Rootman and Flay 1995; Hammond et al. 2009; Germain et al. 2010). For example, a survey of Canadian youth found that strong majorities "liked" regular packages better than plain packages and indicated that plain packages

are "boring* and "uglier" than regular packages (Northrup and Pollard 1995). About one-third of respondents also reported that people their age would he less likely to start smoking if all cigarettes were sold in plain packages. A similar study of Canadian and U.S. youth found that plain packages reduced positive associations with packages and were associated with more negative associations, such as "boring" (Rootman and Fby 1995). More recent research conducted with adult smokers in Australia found that

cardboard brown packs with the number of enclosed cigarettes displayed on the front of the pack and featuring only the brand name in small standard font at the bottom of the pack face were rated as significantly less attractive and popular than original branded packs. Smokers of these plain packs were rated as significantly less trendy/ stylish, less sociable/outgoing, and less mature than smokers of the original pack (Wakefield et al. 2008, p. 416).

Similar results have emerged from a study of youth and adults in the United Kingdom (Hammond et al. 2009). Marketing research conducted on behalf of the tobacco industry with adult smokers also suggests that plain packaging redix-M vrnn* nf tho appal nf miftltinfi

�when we offered them Marlboros at half price�in generic brown boxes�only 21% were interested, even though we assured them that each package was fresh, had been sealed at the factory and was identical (except for the different packaging) to what they normally bought at their local tobacconist or cigarette machine. How to account for the difference? Simple, Smokers put their cigarettes in and out of their pockets 20 to 25 times a day. The package makes a statement. The consumer is expressing how he wants to be seen by others (Trachtenberg 1987, Bates No. TA985253/5256, p. 3).

Together, these findings suggest lhat removing the color and brand imagery from packages reduces the appeal of cigarettes and may reduce their consumption. The position of tobacco companies on regulatory proposals to remove brand imagery also speaks to the importance of brand imagery. In 2008, Citi Investment Research noted,

In the medium-term, we think plain packaging would go a long way to undermine the power of tobacco brands and it is the brands that make the industry so profitable. In our view, in cigarettes,

the pack is the brand, Smokers handle therr cig-arelt. pack probably 20 time, a day. Consul crs pay a premium for certain brands for several reasons, but most would be undermined by plain packaging (Citi Investment Research 200S, p. 2).

Package Shape and Size

*2� ^

An additional component of mandated plain packaging could include regulations to standardize the shape and 5(%e of packages. Tobacco manufacturers have released numerous "special edition" packages, many of which have novel sliapes and can open in different ways (Ncuber 2009). Novel shapes and sizes may increase the apjxsal of cigarette brands and might be particularly engaging to youth. In particular, "slim" packages used to market female brands�such shownrat right�may promote the widespread belief that smoking is an effective way to stay thin and control weight, an important predictor of tobacco use among girts (USDHHS 2001; Carpenter et al. 2005a; Doxey and Hammond 2010), Different shapes and sizes also have the potential to undermine the health warnings on packages. In some cases, the packages are so small and narrow that they either warp the pictures delivering the health warnings or render the text so small as to be unreadable.

Packaging shape may also be a useful marketing tool for smokeless products. The traditional smokeless product has been associated with a round can, hut new smokeless lubacco products aimed at expanding the market beyond traditional users have been packaged in containers featuring a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Ariva, Revel, and the snus products have all used different packaging, perhaps to signal lhat they arc not traditional tobacco products and that they are for different users (more urban, female, etc.) (Mejia and Ling 2010).

Tobacco Packaging and Other Forms of Marketing

Cigarette packages serve as both a form of advertising and a link to other forms of tobacco marketing (Wake-

field and Letcher 2002). As described elsewhere in this chapter, packages play a central role in point-of-sale marketing (Donovan et al. 2002; Wakefield et al. 2002b). Displays of packages in retail outlets, commonly referred to as "powerwalls," have high visibility among youth and help to establish brand imagery and social norms at an early age (Wakefield et ai. 2002b; Dewhirst 2004, 2009; Poilay 2007). Packages can also be used to increase the reach of "below the line" marketing activities by incorporating references to specific promotional activities through Limited-edition packs and plastic overwapping. Recent examples include packages that promote the Formula 1 racing series, advertise Benson & Hedges Kool MIXX music promotions, and promote various events at nightclubs-�all of which have considerable appeal among youth and young adults (Sepe et aL 2002; Carter 2003a; Hafez and Ling 2006) (see e*am-HpJes^fi#it and-belowMr^mme-^^

is printed directly on packs; in others, it is included as an "insert" or "onsert," both of which extend the surface area of the pack. On the basis of evidence in his study, Pol' lay noted, The package is the last and most critical link in an integrated chain of promotional communications'' (2001, p. 3). Since the Family Smoking Premium and Ibbaceo Control Act became law in 2009, manufacturers, distributors, and retailers are in most instances prohibited from sponsoring any athletic event, musical, artistic, or other social or cultural events, using the brand name, logo, symbol, mottos, selling message, recognizable color, or pattern of colors of any brand cigarettes or smokeless tobacco. However, firms are permitted to sponsor such events in the name of their corporation, which manufactures the tobacco product (2/ CFK 1140.34(c)).



Clearly, the package assumes even greater importance when other forms of cigarette marketing are restricted. Package displays in retail outlets typically become more prominent following advertising bans as part of a general increase in point-of-sale marketing (Celebueki and Dts-kin 2002; Wakefield et al. 2002c; Hammond 2006; Canadian Cancer Society 2008). Indeed, advertising baas have prompted many companies to redesign their packages to maximize their impact at the point of sale. Research on pack design conducted in 1994 for BAT stated,"... given the consequences of a total ban on advertising, a pack should be designed to give the product visual impact as well as brand imagery.... The pack itself can be designed so that it achieves more visual impact in the point of sale environment than its competitors" (Miller 1986, Bates No. 105364841/4951, p. 18). Packages are poised to play tin even greater role with the advent of point-of-sale marketing bans, already implemented in countries such as Canada, Iceland, and Thailand. In the 1990s, Philip Morris executives remarked upon Lhis eventuality: "Our final communication vehicle with our smoker is the pack itself In the absence of any other Marketing messages, our pack-aging...is the sole communicator of our brand essence. Put another way -- when you don't have anything else -our packaging is our marketing" (Ilulit 1994, Bates No. ^04ai5M7/5042vpv22)-

Packaging strategies can also be used to offset the impact of other tobacco control measures, such as increases in price and taxation. For example, internal tobacco industry documents indicate tliat packaging cigarettes into smaller, more affordable units (such as 10 cigarettes per package rather than 20) is an effective strategy for targeting price-sensitive youth (Cummings ct al 2002). Legislation in many countries, including the United Stales, now prohibits the sale of cigarettes in units less than 20; however, innovations in the physical shape      ,TO,�_.

and construction of packages (see example)�such as BATs "wallet packs," which open like a book and can be separated into two smaller packages-have been criticized as an attempt to circumvent these prohibitions.

BATs wallet packs were banned in Australia after the federal court in that country upheld an injunction against their sale (see picture previous page) (Chapman 2007). Tobacco companies have also explored packaging strategies to minimize the impact of health warmings, including change in package design to make warnings less distinctive as well as the sale of alternate cases and covers that obscure warnings (Pollay 2001; Wilson et al. 2006). According to later research, further innovation in tobacco packaging is on the horiaon: "Advances in printing technology have enabled printing of on~pack imagery on the inner frame card, outer film and tear tape, and the incorporation of holograms, collectable art, metallic finishes, multi-fold stickers, photographs, and images in pack design" (Freeman et al. 2007, p. 10).

Designing Cigarettes for the Youth Market

Tobacco manufacturers have long recognised through their market research that certain brand features of cigarettes have greater appeal to beginning smokers than to established smokers (Cummings et aL 2002). An analysis of successful first-brand {the brand that is usually or mostly smoked by new smokers) strategies with young, presumably youth smokers, conducted by RJR, attributed Pall Mall's success in the 1940s and 1950s to the brand's promise of mildness that was conveyed by its longer length (Burrows 19841, Similarly, the success of Winston cigarettes with young smokers in the 1950s and 1960s was attributed to increasing awareness of the health effects of smoking, which helped create the demand for filtered cigarettes (Burrows 1984). In the late 1950s, cigarette manufacturers recognised (l*at brands featuring filters were the most popular among young beginning smokers, as illustrated by internal company documents and shifting patterns in the cigarette brands popular with youth smokers between the 1953 and 1964 surveys {Danker 1959; Sugg 1959,1964; William Esty Company 196-1; Burrows 1984). A1959 Philip Morris market research analysis concluded that "people want mildness....We also should win more young nonsmokers with mildness" (Danker 1959, Bates No. 1001755243/5244, p. 1).

Summary

Tobacco packaging provides a direct link to consumers as well as a highly visible form of marketing. In addition to establishing brand identity and appeal, packaging helps to shape perceptions of risk and the sensory experience of smoking. Packaging is influential during youth and young adulthood, the period in which smoking behavior and brand preferences develop. Packaging strategies will continue to evolve in response to restrictions on advertising and promotion as well as the issuance of labeling regulations that mandate larger health warnings and prohibit information deemed to be misleading or deceptive. As the exposure of youth to other forms of marketing becomes increasingly restricted, packaging will assume greater importance as a promotional tool.

Creating a Product That Eases Initi.tion from Harsh Smoke and Nicotine Exposure

Nicotine is one of the harshest chemicals in tobacco smoke and the most important factor in tobacco dependence (Star Scientific, Inc. 2011a). Nicotine is usually highly aversivefor first-time users, yet gradual exposure to the drug is the basis for developing dependence. Through trial, experimentation, and finally conversion to regular smoking, tolerance for nicotine develops (Carchman and Southwkk 1990; Philip Morris USA 2002; Monell Chemical Senses Center 2003; Kreslake et al. 2008b; Connolly et al. 2011). To enhance initiation, it is important that a product balances the innate harshness of smoke with masking agents that allow inhalation, This can be done by affecting perceptions of potential harm via the stimulation of chemosensory neurons in the head and neck�features that affect the tactile, olfactory, and gustatory perceptions in a first-time user (Perfetti et al. 1984; Harji and Irwin 1992). Such receptors can be affected by stimulating cold receptors via menthol flavoring via the maillard browning process (a form of nonennymatic browning similar to carmelization), and design features such as increased ventilation (Aulbach et al. 1991; NCI 2001; Peier el aL 2002). Since the first truly blended American cigarette emerged in 1917 with the Camel brand, the cigarette has gone

through a continued evolution to enhance the ability to optimize nicotine dosing both for initiation and maintenance of smoking (Carchman and Soulhvvick 1990; RJR 1991),

In the 1960s, Philip Morris' Marlboro brand began to attract an increasing share of smokers, especially young males. A review of internal documents of the tobacco industry by Steveason and Proctor (2008) recounts how Philip Morris scientists began experimenting with additives in their brands, including ammonia, diammonium phosphate, and various ethanolamraes and carbonates, to improve the flavor of the smoke and enhance its smoothness.

By the mid-1970s, the Marlboro brand had become the dominant youth cigarette, and the other tobacco companies began to focus efforts on competing directly with Marlboro for market share (RJR 1974; Monahan 1977; BAT 1985), One of the strengths of Marlboro over Winston among young smokers was the perception that Marlboro was bolh smoother than Winston and less strong (Craylon 1971; league 1973b; Bemasek and Nystrom 1982; Burrows 1984; Stevenson and Proctor 2008).

In 1971, Philip Morris introduced Marlboro Lights with a ventilated filter to appeal lo female smokers who desired a Marlboro blended cigarette that was perceived

Lights had become the preferred brand among younger female smokers and had gained an increasing share of male smokers. As of 2005, it was the best-selling brand overall in the U.S. market and especially popular among adolescents (O'Connor 2005).

The success of Marlboro did not go unnoticed by competitors. For example, in 19RI, MR stated that Philip Morris had begun routinely using ammoniated reconstituted tobacco sheet in its cigarette brands in 1965, a time thai corresponded to an increase in sales for Philip Morris brands, especially Marlboro (Philip Morris 1965; RJR 1981). The RJR report noted that its own market studies had shown better consumer response to brands using ammoniated tobacco sheet m the tobacco blend (Tcague 1973a). The ammoniated products produced smoke perceived by consumers as being milder and smoother tasting, with positive flavor characteristics and a stronger physiological impact (league 1973b). Reynolds' scientists speculated that ammonia might improve the flavor of tobacco smoke by reacting with sugars to produce potentially flavorful compounds such as pyrasines (Rodgman 1982).

Internal documents reveal tivA the Marlboro cigarette's smoke, in comparison with RJR's own Winston brand, had a higher pH (higher alkalinity) and hence increased amounts of free nicotine in the smoke and a higher immediate nicotine kick, less irritation of the

mouth, less of a "stemmy" taste and less Turkish and flue-cured flavor, and increased burley fkvor and diar-acter (Crayton 1971; Teague 1973a), Reynolds' scientist noted tJiat competitors' cigarette brands with rising sales, namely Kool and Marlboro, were using reconstituted tobacco sheet in their tobacco blend (Crayton 1971; Moore 1973; RJR 1973,1981; Casey and Perfetti 1980; Bemasek and Nystrom 1982).

The steady growth of Marlboro, which came largely at the expense of declining sales for Winston, was cause for great concern within RJR management (RJR 1974; Monahan 1977), A 1973 report authored by RJR scientist Claude E. league, Jr., noted the importance of product features in successfully capturing a share of the youth smoking market:

"...if our Company is to survive and prosper, over the long term, we must get our share of the youth market. In my opinion this will require new brands tailored to the youth market; I believe it unrealistic to cxiject that existing brands identified with an over-thirty 'establisIin>enF market can ever become the 'in' products.... Thus we need new brands designed to be particularly attractive to the young smoker, while ideally at the same time being appoalinij' to alt smelt (Teague 1973b, Bales No. 502987357//368, p. 2).

Teague identified the following specific characteristics to be used in developing new brands tailored to the youth market (1) nicotine level of 1.0-1.3 milligrams (mg) per cigarette, (2) pH level of the smoke delivered at a level (5.8 to 6.0) to ensure slow absorption of nicotine, (3) tar content of 12-14 mg per cigarette to achieve the desired taste and visible smoke, (4) bland smoke to address the low tolerance of the beginning smoker for irritation from the smoke, (5) 100-millhneter (mm) length to facilitate lighting, and (6) a reasonably firm rod (the barrel of the cigarette) (Teague 1973b).

A summary of a 1974 meeting of RJR senior scientists discussed cigarettes for beginning smokers, noting that such a cigarette should be low in irritation and possibly contain added flavors to make it easier for those who never smoked before to acquire the taste for it more quickly" (Donati 1974, Bates No. 508454171/4174, p. 1). In that year, RJR began using ammoniated sheet material in its Camel Kilter cigarettes; this material was added to Winston Kings in 1979. Later internal documents from RJR noted increased sales performance for both of these brands associated with the use of ammonhited reconstituted tobacco sheet (Casey and Perfetti 1980; RJR 1981; Bemasek and Nystrom 1982).

Preuenttng Tobacco Ike Among Youth and Young Adults

According to internal industry documents, Camel's success among young smokers in the late 1980s and 1990s was, in addition to marketing methods, the result of change* in product design to make the brand as attractive as Marlboro by creating a smoother and less harsh cigarette (Cohen 1984; Wayne and Connolly 2002). According to Wayne and Connolly (2002), RJR scientists experimented hy using different blends in the front and the end of the cigarette; a puffed tobacco filler (involves a process of puffing leaves); new reconstituted tobacco blends using diaminonium phosphate; new humectants (Hystar) ^ reoiaa! glycerin; new flavor additives combining chocolate, vanillin, and licorice at levels below what is traditionally viewed as characterization for food; changes in the circumference and density of tobacco in the rod; and the use of carbowai in the filters to alter sensations in the mouth and the perception of harshness. First-time young adult male smokers were the target group, and the term "smooth" became the main advertising theme for the brand. The use of a cartoon character of a camel called the "Smooth Character" emphasized "smoking pleasure," "smooth taste," and "less harshness." In this case, the design of the cigarette was intentional and interrelated to its marketing (Wayne and Connolly 2002).

The demand for cigarettes that could provide a less harsh taste contributed to the growth of menthol cigarettes in the 1960s and 1970s (Kreslakc et a). 2008a,b). By 1974, two menthol brands, Kool and Salem, were the second and third most popular brands among youth smokers (Curnrnings etal. 2005). Another menthol brand, Newport, was repositioned by LoriJlard in the early 1970s by intentionally lowering menthol levels, which smoothed the smoke through action on thermal receptors and did not create aversrve effects for new smokers from the high levels that would stimulate pain or nociceptors (KresJake etal. 2008a).

As a milder, hipper version of Kool cigarettes, by the mid-1980s, Newport tod captured a large share of the youth market (Achey 1978; Lorillard 1993a). Since then, Newport has continued to be the preferred brand of cigarettes smoked by African American youth and, overall, is the second most popular brand among adolescent smokers today (O'Connor 2005). When FUR introduced the Uptown brand in Philadelphia in the late 1980s targeting young Blacks, it provided lower levels of menthol similar to Newport (Dagnoli 1989).

Tobacco companies have long known of menthoPs ability to mask harshness associated with cigarette smoke, increase the ease of smoking, and provide a cooling sensation ji^f. appeal to many smokers, particularly new smok-

The

ers (Garten and Falkner 2003; Wayne and Connolly 2004; Klausner 2013; Lee and Ghntx 2011). First created in 1925, menthol cigarettes were not develop specifically to appeal to youth, but by the mid4970s tobacco industry market research began to find that they were popular. among young smokers because they were perceived as less harsh and easier to smoke (Kreslakc et ai 2008a; Klaus-ner 2011; Lee and Glantz 2011). Beginning in the 1970s, tobacco companies investigated the effects of adding different amount1; of menthol to cigarettes {Klausner 2011). Kreslake and colleagues (2008a) and Klausner (2011) have shown that the industry adjusted the level of menthol fn cigarettes to appeal to younger smokers. For example, in 1986 an RJR document observed:

...once a smoker adapts to smoking a menthol product, the desire for menthol increases over time. A brand which has a strategy of maximizing franchise acceptance will invariably increase its menthol level. Thus, once a brand becomes successful, its product will evolve in a manner that is not optimal for younger adult non-menthol smckers/switchers (FUR 1986b, Bates No. 505938058/8063, p. 2).

Switching data ... clearly show that KOOL KS [king size) and 100 are not attracting their fair share of starters. Newport, on the other hand, is performing above its fair share... .one basic product difference exists which can possibly explain part of the reason for KOOL's disparity among starters. Basically, it is that KOOUs menthol level is too high (orsiarters {emphasis added] (Canlrell 1987, Bates No. 621079918/9921, p. 1).

By the late 1980s, ail the cigarette manufacturers with major menthol cigarette brands Itad introduced low-level menthol varieties (Kreslake et al. 2008b). By the 1990s, Lorillard's Newport was the most successful menthol bTand and was marketed with a youthful and fun campaign that often depicted young adults engaging in childlike, silly activities (Sutton and Robinson 2004). Again following Newport's successful lead in the youth and young adult markets, other companies, including RJR with its Salem menthol brand, copied the depiction of young people in their marketing materials (Klausner 2011). In 2008, Reynolds American introduced Camel Crush, a flavored extension of the Camel line. Packaged in a visually striking black and blue box, Camel Crush is a regular Camel cigarette (formerly marketed as Came) Light) with a tiny blue capsule inside its filler (Figure 5.4).

When smokers squeeze and snap the capsule, it releases menthol. Other cigarette companies, such as Japan Tobacco, have experimented with the "crush" concept

National survey findings on youth in the United States confirm that menthol cigarette use is disproportionately common among younger and newer teen smokers (Hersey et a). 2006,2010; Rock et al 2010). The latest data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) find that the rate of past month menthol cigarette use among persons aged 12 years and older has increased significantly from 7.7% in 2004 to B2% in 2010 (SAMHSA 2011). The survey found that the use of menthol cigarettes among young smokers aged 18-25 years increased significantly from 114% to 15.9% and remained stable among smokers aged 12-17 years, while nonmen-thol cigarette use during this same time period in each of

538 Chapters

these age groups decreased.

Older industry marketing documents openly discuss the use of flavoring agents in cigarettes to attract the interest of young smokers (Teague 1954, 1969, 1973a; Philip Morris 1965; Crayton 1971; Marketing Innovations 1972; Ritchy 1972; Colby 1973; RJR 1973; Donati 1974; Achey 1978; Cohen 1984; Slone and Bonhomme 1993). For example, in 1972, E&% in a review of new concepts for a youth cigarette, including cola and apple flavors as welt as a sweet flavor, stated, It's a well known fact that teenagers like sweet products. Honey might be considered" (Marketing Innovations 1972, Bates No. 170042014, p. 1). In the same year, RJR was speculating about a product that could target competitor brands (Le., Marlboro and Kool) that had "exhibited exceptional strength in the under 35 age group, especially in the 14-20 group" (Ritchy 1972, Bates Ho. 501283430/3431, p. 2). One suggestion included an apple wine cigarette, an idea attributed to the growing popularity of fruit wines among young adults aged 18-25 years 0 (itchy 3972).

Even after tobacco manufacturers agreed as part of the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement to discontinue any marketing that might appeal to adolescents, RJR introduced anew line of Camel cigarettes promoting unique flavors; these cigarettes had names such as Crema, Mandarin Mini, Aegean Spice, Hamfabp Lime, Warm Winter.Toffee, and Kauai Kolada (Sugg 1964; Connolly 2004; Carpenter et al. 2005b; Lewis and Wackowski 2006). In 2003, RJR introduced Saiem Silver with flavored varieties such as Dark Currents and Cool Myst, and in the same year, B&W introduced Kool Smooth Fusions, which included flavored cigarettes such as Midnight Berry and Mocha Taboo (Sugg 1964; Connolly 2004; Carpenter et al. 2005b; liwis and Vfeckowski 2006). In 2004, RJR and B&W merged to form Reynolds American, bringing all of these flavored brands under a single manufacturer. In 2005, Reynolds American introduced yet another line of Camel cigarettes, this time under the theme 'High Roller High Ball,'" with varieties such as Blackjack Gin, SnakeEyes Scotch, and ScrewDriver Slots (Ashare et al. 2007). In 2006, however, Reynolds American voluntarily stopped selling 28 kinds of (kmcl, Kool, and Salem cigarettes that featured certain flavors as part of a settlement with state attorneys general who claimed that the marketing of flavored cigarettes violated the Master Settlement Agreement (Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids 2006).

Cigarette manufacturers have consistently maintained that their flavored cigarette varieties were intended solely for adult smokers and were introduced to capitalize on consumer demand for special flavorings in products such as coffee and liquor (Finucane 2004). And yet, data from two nationally representative surveys conducted in 2004 found that younger smokers were more likely to

have tried a flavored cigarette than were older smokers (Klein et aL 2008). In one of these surveys, overall use of any flavored brands in the past 30 days was 11.9% among smokers aged 17-26 years and 6.7% among smokers aged 25 yean and older.

A Study of college students who were shown different advcrtiseincnts for flavored and nonflavored cigarette brands found that they consistently rated the flavored brands more positively regardless of their smoking status (Ashare et aL 2007). Moreover, positive expectancies of a brand were correlated with an increased intention to try the brand, independent of the subjects' smoking status, Thus, the addition of special flavorings, such as those in Camel cigarettes, most likely allowed the manufacturer to make the brand itself (in this case Camel) more attractive to starter smokers.

Under Food Law, "flavor" is defined narrowly as an entity with characterising or recognizable gustatory effects (Pood and Drugs, 21 CFR �101.22 (20101). In the case of menthol, Philip Morris tested an analogue of menthol called W14, developed by Wilkerson Sword Company, that removed the gustatory effecls of menthol but retained its thermoreceptor effects (Seligman 1975), In the case of cigarettes, where the flavor may be combusted or combined with other flavors (as is the case with the maillard browning process), much more than gustatory effects play a role in the influence of the flavor on initiation and maintenance of smoking (Wayne and Connolly 2002). These would include olfactory, tactile, and other chernosensory responses. The tobacco industry las long argued that flavors are safe in cigarettes based on ingestion models. However, ingestion models are not necessarily applicable because a combusted flavor that is inhaled into the lungs may be far more dangerous than one ingested orally by the body.

The Family Smokbig Prevention and Ibbacco Control Art, enacted in the United States in 2009, prohibited a cigarette or any of its component parts from containing, as a constituent or additive, certain characterizing flavors (except menthol). The act also mandated the Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) to produce a report and recommendations on the public health impact of menthol cigarettes, including its use among children and racial and ethnic minorities (USFDA 2011b). The TPSAC concluded that "the availability of menthol cigarettes have an adverse impact on public health in the United States by increasing the number of smokers with resulting premature death and avoidable mortality." Consequently TPSAC made the following recommendation to PDA: (USFDA201lb,p,225)'"Rcmavil of menthol cigarettes from the maketplace would benefit public health in the United States." However, TPSAC did not recommend any

particular action by FDA, noting that there were a variety of actions that FDA might lake related to menthol cigarettes. The tobacco companies submitted their industry perspective document to the FDA in March 2011, and argued that menthol cigarettes had no disproportionate impact on public health (Non-voting Industry Representatives of the TPSAC Committee 2011).

The Design of Other Tobacco Products

Cigarettes are not the only type of tobacco product used by youth; indeed, an increasing percentage of youth report using cigars and smokeless tobacco (Connolly 1995,2004; Delnevo et al. 2003; Solda etal. 2003; Carpenter et al. 2009; see Chapler 3). Since 1998, overall sales (all ages) of small cigars and moist snuff have increased, while cigarette sales have declined slightly (see Chapter 3). Much of the growing popularity of small cigars and smokeless tobacco is among younger adult consumers (aged <30 years) and appears to be linked to the marketing of flavored tobacco products that, like cigarettes, might be expected to be attractive to youth (Sold* et al. 2003).

Tobacco companies have long used wintergreen in the development of smofcelesTTobacco products, and more recently, mulliple flavors. By the 1980s, U.S. Tobacco knew that new smokeless users preferred flavors (Connolly 1995) and that pH modifiers could alter pH, thus potentially affecting the level of free nicotine in the product (Manning 1981). In addition, U.S. Tobacco used mint and cherry flavored smokeless products as part of a "graduation strategy with low free nicotine content to encourage new users to start with particular products and progress to others with higher levels of free nicotine (Figure 5.5; U.S. Smokeless "Ibbacco 1984). The effectiveness of such manipulations of free nicotine was confirmed in a National Institute on Drug Abuse study that demonstrated higher nicotine blood levels and stronger addictive effects in products with greater free nicotine levels (Pant et al. 1999). This integration of product design with marketing helped to reverse the mid-twentieth century decline in smokeless tobacco use and spurred a rapid increase in smokeless tobacco use by adolescents and young adult males (USDHHS 1986; Connolly 1995; Slade 1995; Tomar etal 1995).

In 2007, Philip Morris purclwsed John Middleton Co., maker of the popular and inexpensive Black & Mild flavored cigars, and introduced a new line of flavored smokeless tobacco products using the Marlboro brand name {Carpenter et al. 2009), In 2005, Reynolds American purchased Conwood Tobacco Company {now American Snuff

In 2006, Reynolds American began test-marketing Camel Snus, a smokeless tobacco product in three flavors: spice, frost, and original (Carpenter et ah 2009; Mejia and Ling 2010), and began test-marketing Camel dissolvable

smokeless products in 2010 (RJR 2010a). Packaging portions of smokeless tobacco in teabag-Iike porous pouches was also viewed as a product innovation that might ease adoption of smokeless tobacco products among novices (Beethani 1985). This prevented floating of the tobacco in the mouth and the subsequent rapid release of nicotine. The new suits products on the market in 2011 use both

the portion pouch and flavored tobacco strategies. Interna! industry documents as well as product tasting revealed that, much as they did for cigarettes, manufacturers of smokeless tobacco altered the pH levels of their products to lower free-nicotine delivery in "starter products" that were widely distributed as free samples and were advertised as much Jess harsh (Connolly 1995; Djordjevic et al. 199S). Once the new user had adapted to low dose products, they were encouraged through marketing to progress to higher free-nicotine brands as dependence ensued. In addition, a recent paper by Carpenter and colleagues (2009) reveals that cigarette manufacturers are promoting smokeless tobacco products as a way for smokers to cope with restrictions on indoor smoking (also see Mejia and ling 2010; Mejia ct al. 2010). The strategy � to provide current smokers with an acceptable alternative they can use to satisfy nicotine cravings in places where smoking is not permitted.

However, for a tobacco company to be profitable over thc~tong term, it mrist-aimpete success^ fully for a share of the youth market As stated succinctly in one of RJR's marketing research documents, "Young adult smokers have been the critical factor in tlte growth and decline of every major brand and company over the

Introduction

Tobacco companies use the retail environment extensively to advertise and stimulate sales of their products (FTC 2011a). This section reviews the tobacco industry's point-of-sale strategies, the quantity and nature of retail tobacco marketing, young people's exposure to the industry's marketing messages and its impact on their smoking behavior, and policy options for affecting tobacco marketing in this environment.

The signing of the Master Settlement Agreement

stimulated a dramatic shift of the industry to point-of-sale marketing, one of the few venues not affected by advertising restrictions. However, industry executives have recognized the importance of using displays and advertising at the point of sale for decades (Carter 2003h; Lavack

last 50 years" (Burrows 1984, Bates No. 50192846278550, p. 4). Internal documents and marketing practices from the industry reveal that in the past, manufacturers modified product design to enhance product appeal to novice users, including adolescents and young adults (i.e., 18- to 24-year-olds), a practice the industry has continued (tJ.S. Department of Justice n.d.).

Until the Family Smoking and Prevention and Tbbacco Control Act (2009), the design and packaging of products was almost completely devoid of regulatory controls with tl*e exception that package labels bear small tat warning statements. (Hcnningfield et al. 2004). As a result, over the years tobacco manufacturers have relied on altering aspects of the product and its packaging as a way of attracting consumers, including new users. Policy options related to product design that have been suggested for reducing youth initiation include: (1) regulating aspects of product packaging, such as the quantity (e.g., mandating cartons only), (2) child proofing the package, (3) changing the look of the package (eg., no color or images), and (4) modifying product design so the product itself becomes nonaddictive (e.g., limits on nicotine) and/ or less palatable (e.g., no filter vents, no flavors). Ttiere are also methods that could be employed so the ingredients allow a smoker to continue but create aversion among a iwiniw (Henningfield et al. 2004;.Cummings et al. 2005, 2006). Making tobacco products nonaddictive, at least for youth, would have the positive effect of halting initiation quickly and permitting regular tohacco users to quit over time, which most would do (league 1972).

and Toth 2006; Pollay 2007). Marketing expenditures reported by cigarette companies to FTC indicate that in 2008 tobacco companies spent approximately &4% of their marketing dollars in stores, including point-of-sale advertising, price discount, retail promotional allowances, and retail-value-added items (see Table 5.1 for definitions and Table 5.2 for line item amounts; FTC 20Ha).

Cigarette companies reach both current and future customers by advertising and promoting their products in stores (Carter 2003b; Lavack and Toth 2006); consumers, regardless of age, can be exposed to prosmoking messages in stores (Rogers et al. 19f)5). Most cigarettes and ads are strategically placed around checkout counters to ensure maximum exposure and stimulate impulse purchases (Pollay 2007). Like other companies in the retail sector, tobacco companies advertise, offer special sales, and try to

Message from Kathleen Sebelius

Secretary of Health and Human Services

Tobacco use imposes enormous public health and financial costs on this nation�costs that are completely avoidable. Until we end tobacco use, more people will become addicted, more people will become sick, more families will be devastated by the loss of loved ones, and the nation will continue to incur damaging medical and lost productivity costs. Now is the time to fully implement proven and effective interventions that reduce tobacco-caused death and disease and to help end this public health epidemic once and for all

Cigarettes are responsible for approximately 443,000 deaths�one in every five deaths�each year in the United States, The chronic diseases caused by tobacco use lead the causes of death and disability in the United States and unnecessarily strain our health care system. The economic burden of cigarette use includes more than $193 billion annually in health are costs and loss of productivity.

We can prevent the staggering toll that tobacco takes on individuals, families, and communities. This new Surgeon General's report focuses on cigarettes and cigarette smoke to provide further evidence on how cigarettes cause addiction and premature death. It identifies better approaches to helping people stop smoking and brings to light new ideas for how to lower the incidence of smoking-caused disease.

Iwenty years of successful state efforts show that the more states invest in tobacco control programs, the greater the reductions in smoking, and Lhe longer states maintain such programs, the greater and faster the impact. The largest impacts come when we increase tobacco prices, ban smoking in public places, offer affordable and accessible cessation treatments and services, and combine media campaigns with other initiatives. We have outlined a level of state investment m comprehensive tobacco control and prevention efforts thatT^implemented, would result in an estimated five million fewer smokers over the next five years. Hundreds of thousands of premature deaths caused by tobacco mt could be prevented, and many fewer of the nations' children would be deprived by premature death of their aunts, uncles, parents, and grandparents. Importantly, in 2009 the U.S. Pood and Drug Administration received statutory authority to regulate tobacco products. This has the potential to lead to even greater progress in reducing morbidity and mortality from tobacco use.

Tobacco prevention and control efforts need to be commensurate with the harm caused by tobacco use, Otherwise, tobacco use will remain the largest cause of preventable illness and death in our nation for decades to come. When we help Americans quit tobacco use and prevent our youth from ever starting, we all benefit Now is the time for comprehensive public health and regulatory approaches to tobacco control, We have the knowledge and tools to largely eliminate tobacco caused disease. If we seize this moment, we will make a difference in all of our communities and in the lives of generations

Foreword

In 1964, the first Surgeon General's report on the effects of smoking on health was released. In the nearly 50 years since, extensive data from thousands of studies have consistently substantiated the devastating effects of smoking on the lives of millions of Americans. Yet today in the United States, tobacco use remains the single largest preventable cause of death and disease for both men and women. Now, this 2010 report of the Surgeon General explains beyond a shadow of a doubt how tobacco smoke causes disease, validates earlier findings, and expands and strengthens the science base. Armed with this irrefutable data, the time has come to mount a full-scale assault on the tobacco epidemic.

More than 1,000 people are killed every day by cigarettes, and one-half of all long-term smokers are killed by smoldng-relatcd diseases. A large proportion of these deaths are from early heart attacks, chronic lung diseases, and cancers. Por every person who dies from tobacco use, another 20 Americans continue to suffer with at least one serious tobacco-related illness. But the harmful effects of smoking do not end with the smoker. Every year, thousands of nonsmokers die from heart disease and lung cancer, and hundreds of thousands of children suffer from respiratory infections because of exposure to secondhand smoke, There is no risk-free level of exposure to tobacco smoke, and there is no safe tobacco product.

This new Surgeon CeneraTs report describes in detail the ways tobacco smoke damages every organ in the body and causes disease and death. We must build on our successes and more effectively educate people about the health risks of tobacco use, prevent youth from ever using tobacco products, expand access to proven cessation treatments and services, and reduce exposure to secondhand smoke. Putting laws and other restrictions in place, including making tobacco products progressively less aflordahkr-Mtillultiniately lead to our goal of a healthier America hy reducing thf devastating ftffecrs of smoking.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. Pood and Drug Administration (FDAJ, and other federal agencies are diligently working toward this goal by implementing and supporting policies and regulations that strengthen our resolve to end the tobacco epidemic CDC has incorporated the World Health Organization's M POWER approach into its actions at the local, state, and national levels. MPOWEfi consists of six key interventions proven to reduce tobacco use that can prevent millions of deaths. CDC, along with federal, state, and local partners, is committed to monitoring the tobacco epidemic and prevention policies; protecting people from secondhand smoke where they live, work, and play; offering quit assistance to current smokers; warning about the dangers of tobacco; enforcing comprehensive restrictions on tobacco advertising, promotion, and sponsorship; and raising taxes and prices on tobacco products.

In 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tbbacco Control Act was enacted, giving PDA explicit regulatory authority over tobacco products to protect and promote the health of the American public. Among other things, this historic legislation gave the agency the authority to require companies to reveal all of the ingredients in tobacco products�including the amount of nicotine�and to prohibit the sale of tobacco products labeled as 'light," "mild," or "low." Further, with this new regulatory mandate, FDA will regulate tobacco advertising and require manufacturers to use more effective warning labels, as well as restrict the access of young people to their products. FDA will also assess and regulate modified risk products, taking into account the impact their availability and marketing has on initiation and cessation of tobacco use.

Reducing the tremendous toll of disease, disability, and death caused by tobacco use in the United Stales is an urgent need and a shared responsibility. All public health agencies need to partner together to develop common strategies to combat the dangers of smoking and tobacco use and defeat this epidemic for good.

This 2010 Surgeon General's report represents another important step in the developing recognition, both in this nation and around the world, that tobacco use is devastating to public health. Past investments in research and in comprehensive tobacco control programs-combined with the findings presented by this new report�provide the foundation, evidence, and impetus to increase the urgency of our actions to end the epidemic of tobacco use.

Preface

from the Surgeon General, United States Public Health Service

In 1964, the Surgeon General released a landmark report on the dangers of smoking. During the intervening 45 years, 29 Surgeon General's reports have documented the overwhelming and conclusive biologic, epidemiologic, behavioral, and pharmacologic evidence that tobacco use is deadly. Our newest report, How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease, is a comprehensive, scientific discussion of how mainstream and secondhand smoke exposures damage the human body. Decades of research have enabled scientists to identity the specific mechanisms of smoking-related diseases and to characterize them in great detail. Those biologic processes of cigarette smoke and disease are tlw focus of this report

One-third of people who have ever tried smoking become daily smokers. This report investigates how and why smokers become addicted and documents how nicotine compares with heroin and cocaine in its hold on users and its effects on the brain. The way tobacco is grown, mixed, and processed today has made cigarettes more addictive than ever before. Because of this, the majority of smokers who try to quit on their own typically require many attempts. It is imperative that we use this information to prevent initiation, make tobacco products less addictive, and provide access to treatments and services to help smokers quit successfully.

This new report also substantiates the evidence that there is no safe level of exposure to cigarette smoke. When individuals inhale cigarette smoke, either directly or secondhand, they are inhaling more than 7,000 chemicals: hundreds of these are hazardous, and at least 69 are known to cause cancer. The chemicals are rapidly absorbed by cells in the body and produce disease-causing cellular changes. This

In addition, the report discusses how chemicals in cigarette smoke impair the immune system and cause the kind of cellular damage that leads to cancer and other diseases. Insight is provided as to why smokers are far more likely to suffer from chronic disease than are nonsmokers.

By learning how tobacco smoke causes disease, we leam more about how chemicals harm cells, how genes may make us susceptible, and how tobacco users become addicted to nicotine. The answers to these questions wilt help us to more effectively prevent tobacco addiction and treat tobacco-caused disease. Understanding the complexity of genetic, biochemical, and other influences discussed in this report offers the promise of reducing the disease burden from tobacco use through earlier detection and better treatment; however, even with all of the science presented here, it currently remains true that the only proven strategies to reduce the risks of tobacco-caused disease are preventing initiation, facilitating cessation, and eliminating exposure to secondhand smoke.

My priority as Surgeon General is the health of the American people. Although we have made great strides in tobaao control, more than 440,000 deaths each year are caused by smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. The cost to the nation is tremendous: a staggering amount is spent on medical care and lost productivity. But most importantly there is immeasurable cost in human suffering and loss.

In 1964, Surgeon General Luther Terry called for "appropriate remedial actions" to address the adverse effects of smoking. With this report, the devastating effects of smoking have been characterized in great detail and the need for appropriate remedial action is even more apparent The harmful effects of tobacco smoke do not end with the users of tobacco. There is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. Every inhalation of tobacco smoke exposes our children, our families, and our loved ones to dangerous chemicals that can damage their bodies and result in life-threatening diseases such as cancer and heart disease. And, although not a focus of this report, we know that smokeless tobacco causes cancer and has other adverse health effects. The science is now clear that "appropriate remedial actions" include protecting everyone in the country from having to breathe secondhand smoke; making all tobacco products progressively less affordable; expanding access to proven cessation treatments

and services; taking actions at the federal, state, and local levels to counteract the influence 0/ tobacco advertising, promotions, and sponsorship; and ensuring that all adults and children clearly understand that the result of tobaao use is addiction, suffering, reduced quality of life, and all too often, early death. Forty-five years after Surgeon General Terry called on this nation to ad, I say, if not now, when? The health of our nation depends on it.

Major Conclusions

Tlie scientific evidence supports the following major conclusions:

1.    The evidence on the mechanisms by which smoking causes disease indicates that there is no risk-free level of exposure to tobacco smoke.

2.    Inhaling the complex chemical mixture of combustion compounds in tobacco smoke causes adverse health outcomes, particularly cancer and cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, through mechanisms that include DMA damage, inflammation and oxidative stress.

3.    Through multiple defined mechanisms, the risk and seventy of many adverse health outcomes caused by smoking are directly related to the duration and level of exposure to tobacco smoke.

4.    Sustained use and long-term exposures to tobaao smoke are due to the powerfully addicting effects of tobacco products, which are mediated by diverse actions of nicotine and perhaps other compounds, at multiple types of nicotinic receptors in the brain.

5.    l<ow levels of exposure, including exposures to secondhand tobacco smoke, lead to a rapid and sharp increase in endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, which are implicated in acute cardiovascular events and thrombosis.

6.    There is insufficient evidence that product modification strategies to lower emissions of specific toxicants in tobacco smoke reduce risk for the major adverse health outcomes.

Chapter Conclusions

Chapter 2.The Changing Cigarette

3. The overall health of the public could be harmed if the introduction of novel tobacco products encourages tobacco use among people who would otherwise be unlikely to use a tobacco product or delays cessation among persons who would otherwise quit using tobacco altogether.

Chapter 3. Chemistry and Toxicology of Cigarette Smoke and Bio markers of Exposure and Harm

1.    In spite of uncertainties concerning whether particular cigarette smoke constituents are responsible for specific adverse health outcomes, there is broad scientific agreement that several of the major classes of chemicals in the combustion emissions of burned tobacco are toxic and carcinogenic.

2.    The design characteristics of cigarettes, including ventilation features, filters, and paper porosity, have a significant influence on the levels of toxic and carcinogenic chemicals in the inhaled smoke.

3.    The different types of tobacco lamina (e.g., bright, burley, or oriental) that are combined to produce a specific tobacco blend have a significant influence on the levels of toxic and carcinogenic chemicals in the combustion emissions of burned tobaao.

4.    There is no available cigarette machine-smoking method that can be used to accurately predict doses of the chemical constituents of tobacco smoke received when using tobacco products.

9.    There is consistent evidence for an inherited susceptibility of lung cancer with some less common genotypes unrelated to a familial clustering of smoking behaviors.

Introduction

Cigarettes are the most common form of tobacco used in most of the world (World Health Organization IW110I 2006) and cause 443,000 deaths in the United States each year (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS] 1986,1983; National Cancer Institute [NCI| 1997; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2008). The primary short- and long-range strategies for reducing deaths associated with tobacco use are cessation and prevention, respectively, along with reduction of secondhand smoke exposure (Warner et al. 1998; 0SDHHS 2000; Stratton et al 2001; WHO 2003a). Another concept that has been considered is changing the cigarette itself to make it less toxic. The concept of modifying conventional cigarettes to be potentially less harmful is not new. Beginning in the 1950s, the tobacco industry embarked on efforts to modify cigarettes in response to

growing public awareness of the health hazards of tobacco use, primarily through reducing machine-measured tar and nicotine content (NCI 1996). However, evidence now demonstrates that these modifications did not reduce the risk of cigarette smoking and in addition may have undermined efforts to prevent tobacco use and promote cessation (NCI 2001). In recent years, a range of new products have been introduced and marketed to smokers as an alternative to conventional cigarettes, sometimes accompanied by messages, explicit or implied, that they offer reduced exposure to toxic substances or risk of disease (Peder-son and Nelson 2007). The focus of this chapter is on the health consequences of changes in cigarette design over lime. Coverage of novel cigarette products is not intended to be comprehensive or current, because this market is rapidly evolving.

Cigarette Design Changes over the Years

The history of tobacco product design and marketing has been discussed elsewhere and need not be repeated (Reynolds and Shachtman 1989; Goodman 1993, 2004; Hilts 1996; Kluger 1996; Tate 1999; Brandt 2007). However, the tobacco industry's internal memoranda and other documents make it clear that the core concept and function of the cigarette has changed little since its invention in the early part of the nineteenth century; namely, it is a tobacco-derived product for delivering nicotine to the user (University of California at San Francisco (UCSFJ 2008).

By the early 1950s, mounting scientific evidence began to implicate cigarette smoking in the development of serious respiratory, heart, and neoplastic diseases (Royal College of Physicians of London 1962; U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare IUSDHEW] 1964). This evidence created a new force in cigarette design that has remained prominent to this day: to design cigarettes that could be marketed as addressing the health concerns of both cigarette smokers and health professionals by reducing toxicants (Slade and Henningrleld 1993; Stratton et al. 2001). Early efforts to reduce toxicants focused on efforts to reduce the overall tar (e.g., total particulate matter minus nicotine and water content) and nicotine yields of cigarettes.

The first major design change to reduce lar and nicotine yields was the introduction of fitters in the 1950s.

Before 1950, only 0.6 percent of cigarettes were filtered, but the increasing lay press coverage of the potential dangers of smoking led to an explosion of filter development and marketing. By 1960, filtered cigarettes represented 51 percent of the cigarette market (USDHHS1989). By20O5, they represented 99 percent of the market Major design efforts to reduce machine-measured tar and nicotine yields continued throughout the 1960s and 1970s with the introduction of "light" and low-tar cigarettes. Efforts to further reduce machine-measured tar and nicotine yields included the use of porous cigarette paper, reconstituted tobacco, filter tip ventilation, and the use of expanded tobacco (Hoffmann et al. 1996).

The initial focus on reduction of tar and nicotine yields was supported by early case-control studies suggesting that cancer risks were reduced by increased use of filters and decreased machine-measured lar deu'very, and laboratory studies appeared to confirm this dose-response relationship. This research led to the seemingly reasonable conclusion that cigarettes with tower machine-measured tar and nicotine might nose fewer hazards, assuming that smokers did not increase the number of cigarettes they smoked per day or otherwise change their smoking behaviors (USDHEW 1967, 1969, 1971, 1974; USDHHS 1981; Stratton et al. 2001). Thus, it was widely accepted that declining tar and nicotine levels could lead to decreased disease risk. The concept that reduced exposure to

Surgeon Generate Report

toxicants could reduce disease risk was supported by previous Surgeon General's reports (USDHEW 1969). In 1966, the U.S. Public Health Service recommended "the progressive reduction of the 'tar4 and nicotine content of cigarette smoke" (USDHEW 1966, p. 2), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that it would generally permit cigarette companies to make marketing claims about tar and nicotine yields as long as those statements were based on a uniform machine-based test method for measuring tar and nicotine yields, subsequently known as "the FTC method" {Peeler 1996; Pillsbury 1996).

Efforts to reduce tar and nicotine yields as measured on the basis of machine-smoking conditions were successful. The sales-weighted deliveries in U.S. cigarette smoke decreased from 38 milligrams (mg) of tar and 2.7 mg of nicotine in 1954 to 12 mg of tar and 0.95 mg of nicotine m 1993 (Hoffmann et al. 1996). Machine measurements of tar have shown little change since then, and machine measurements of nicotine delivery have remained at approiimately 0.9 mg per cigarette since 1981 {Federal Register 1995,1996; Slade et al. 1995; Hurt and Robertson 1998; KessJer 2001).

Unfortunately, with the accrual and evaluation of additional data, the evidence today does not demonstrate that efforts to lower rracliine*meMumft�^i>nthwcoti! yields actually decreased the health risks of smoking, primarily because these changes did not reduce smokers' actual exposure to tobacco toxicants (NCI 2001; USDHHS 2004). Indeed, to the extent that filters and other efforts to reduce machine-measured tar and nicotine reduced smokers' health concerns, and thereby delayed quitting and/or increased cigarette use, they may have contributed to an overall increase in dgarette-caused mortality (Strat-ton et al. 2001).

As mentioned above, for example, the first effort to change the design of cigarettes was the addition of the filter. In theory, use of filter technologies can remove substantial amounts of a wide variety of toxicants (Browne 1990; Hoffmann and Hoffmann 1997). In fact, however, evidence on the ability of niters to reduce harm is not clear (Slade 1993; NCI 2001; Stratton et al. 2001). And, some novel niter designs may introduce new toxicants such as asbestos (Slade 1993), carbon (Pauly et al. 1997), and glass (Pauly et al. 1998). The wide variation in filter technology across brands and over time precludes general conclusions about whether filters increased or decreased exposure of smokers to toxicants.

Similarly, a variety of design features made it possible for cigarette smokers to compensate, that is, easily ingest severalfold higher amounts of tar and nicotine than the yields obtained when using the machine-based FTC method (Djordjevic et al. 2000; NCI 2001; Stratton et al.

16  Chapter 2

2001; WHO 2003c), Most important was the introduction of ventilation holes in the cigarette filters, which allowed smoke to escape during machine testing. In the 1980s, researchers discovered that smokers covered these ventilation hofes with their fingers, negating the effect of the holes in reducing smoke exposure (Kozlowski et al. 1980, 2002,2006), Moreover, subsequent research demonstrated that the use of ventilation holes produced higher levels of free-base nicotine, which led to a more addictive product as well as deeper lung inhalation of cooler and less harsh smoke (Stratton et al. 2001; Pankow et al. 2003a,b; Watson et al. 2004). Driven by nicotine addiction and enabled by cigarettes that delivered smoother, cooler smoke diluted by ambient air, smokers could easily compensate for reduced delivery of nicotine by increasing smoke intake per cigarette and per day, thus maintaining high levels of disease risk (NCI 2001; Thun and Burns 2001),

Tobacco industry documents, many of which are available at the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library at UCSP, clearly demonstrate that at least by the mid-1970s the tobacco industry well understood the importance of creating health reassurance messages in order to alleviate health concerns, and that one important method of doing so was through claims of low deliveries of tar, For example, a 1977 British American Tobacco marketing report con-providing consumer reassurance {emphasis in original) about cigarettes and the smoking habit. This can be provided in different ways, e.g. by claimed low deliveries, by the perception of low deliveries and by the perception of 'mildness"* (Short 1977, p. 3). At the same time, tobacco company documents also clearly demonstrate that the industry understood that smokers would not achieve the claimed deliveries because of smoker compensation. For example, a 1975 Philip Morris memo noted: "In effect, the Marlboro 85 smokers in this study did not achieve any reduction in smoke intake by smoking a cigarette (Marlboro Lights) normally considered lower in delivery" (Goodman 1975, p. 3).

In contrast to industry awareness, the various ways that cigarettes were physically modified and the nature and level of compensation in response to design changes were not well understood by parties outside of the tobacco industry itself. Public health officials had little basis to anticipate the degree to which manufacturers could design cigarettes to allow smokers to draw more smoke and nicotine from cigarettes than was represented by machine-measured yields, of tar and nicotine (NCI 2001; Parascandola 2005).

It was not until the turn of the twenty-first century that it became increasingly clear that no relationship existed between machine-measured tar and nicotine levels and risks for most categories of cigarette-related diseases.

How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease: The Biology and Behavioral Basis for Smoktog-Attrtbutable Disease

In 1994, an expert committee convened by NCI concluded: "The smoking of cigarettes with lower machine-memured yields has a small effect in reducing the risk of cancer caused by smoking, no effect on the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and an uncertain effect on the risk or" pulmonary disease" (NCI 1996, p. vi). Moreover, whereas squamous cell carcinomas liad been the predominant form of King cancer, by the late twentieth century adenocarcinoma of the lung was becoming increasingly common, presumably reflecting deeper inhalation of smoke that was facilitated by ventilated filters as well as other factors such as changes in agricultural practices, tobacco curing, and cigarette manufacturing processes that could lead to increased concentrations of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (NCI 2001; Stratton etat, 2001) (see Chapter 5, "Cancer"). By 2001, NCI concluded that "measurements of tar and nicotine yields using the FTC method do not offer smokers meaningful information on the amount of tar and nicotine they will receive from a cigarette" (NCI 2001, p. 10). The 2001 review also concluded that the evidence "...does not indicate a benefit to public health from changes in cigarette design and manufacturing over the last fifty years" (NCI 2001, p. 10). Today, there is a scientific consensus that changes in cigarette designs from the 1950s to the 1980s to reduce machine-measured tar yields

did not result in decreased morbidity and mortality (NCI 2001; Thun and Burns 2001). In sum, it took decades to recognize that changes to reduce machine-measured tar and nicotine yields in cigarettes did not have a measurable beneficial impact on public health (NCI 2001). In 2008, FTC rescinded its 1966 guidance that generally permitted statements concerning tar and nicotine yield if they were based on the Cambridge filter method (sometimes called the FTC method) (FTC 2008).

Other changes during the past 50 years have included efforts that potentially have made cigarettes more addicting through the use of flavors, chemical treatments to alter the smell and appearance of cigarette smoke, methods to mask noxious sensory effects, and control of the nicotine dose (see Chapter 4, "Nkotine Addiction; Past and Present*'}, These approaches included new types of filters, tobacco blends, and ingredients; cigarette ventilation; control of pH; and efforts to reduce various volatile organic compounds in tobacco and smoke. These product modifications have the potential to increase the risk of addiction by contributing to increased risk of ini-tiatlng use of the product, increased ease of smoke inhalation, decreased noxiousness of the smoke, and possibly increased brain nicotine exposure (WHO 2007; Chapter 4, "Nicotine Addiction: Past and Present").

New Cigarette Products

Cigarette smoke contains more than 7,000 chemicals, including at least 69 known carcinogens and many other toxicants implicated in major diseases (International Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC] 2004; Borgerding and Klus 2005; Rodgman and Perfetti 2009), and because the potency of toxicants and mechanisms of action differ, reducing concentrations of individual toxicants might have only a negligible effect on disease risk from smoking (Fowles and Dybuig 2003; Pankow et al. 2007; Burns et ah 2008). Despite these challenges, Brown & Williamson (acquired by RJ. Reynolds in 2004), Vector Tobacco, and Philip Morris have all developed cigarettes that purport to deliver lower levels of specific toxicants (e.g., carcinogenic nitrosamines) as determined by standard machine-smoking methods. This reduction in toxicant levels has been accomplished by use of new technologies in tobacco curing and/or by adding carbon or other materials to cigarette filters (Hoffmann et al. 2001; IARC 2004). However, the extent to which exposure to toxicants is actually reduced in smokers is not known because reduced machine-measured yields of toxicants do not Mcessariiy reflect actual human exposure. A smoker

who switches to a brand with lower machine-measured toxicants may smoke these cigarettes in a more intense fashion or may consume more cigarettes per day than previously. Either change could result in greater human exposure to toxicants and no decrease in risk of disease.

For example, Brown & Williamson introduced Advance as a new cigarette with the claim that levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) were 70 percent lower than those in leading "light" brands (Star Scientific 2005). Preliminary laboratory studies of cigarette smokers provide mixed evidence for the possibility that use of this cigarette substitute would result in reduced exposure to tobacco toxicants (Breland et at. 2002,2O03), Omni, manufactured by Vector Tobacco, is a conventional cigarette for which the marketers claimed lower levels of carcinogenic polycydic aromatic hydrocarbons, nitrosamines, and catechols (Vector Group 2001). Preliminary studies in which Ornni is smoked instead of the smokers' usual brand of cigarettes provide little evidence for reduced exposure to toxicants (Hatsukami et al, 2004b; Hughes et al.2004).

Low-Nicotine Cigarettes

to theory, gradually reducing the content and yield d nicotine in cigarettes over a period of many years, using design features that make compensation difficult or impossible, might lessen smokers' dependence on nicotine. Low-nicotine cigarettes have also been proposed as a method to prevent new smokers (primarily youth) from ever establishing nicotine dependence (Benowitz and Henningneld 1994; Henningfkld et al 1998; Benowitz et al. 2007; Zeller et al. 2009). However, the potential role of nicotine analogues in maintaining addiction is poorly understood.

A commercial cigarette with very low nicotine content was introduced in test markets in 1989 under the brand name Next (Butschky et al. 1995). The nicotine content of Next appeared to be lower than the levels hypothesized by Benowitz and Henningneld (1994) to be

the addictive threshold. The test market ended in 1991 when Philip Morris withdrew the product from the market Quest was a low-nicotine cigarette developed by Vector Tobacco (Rose and Behm 2004; Vector Tobacco 2004). Three products were available: (1) a cigarette with 0.6 mg of nicotine and 10 mg of tar per cigarette, as determined by FTC machine measurements; (2) a cigarette with 03 mg of nicotine and 10 mg of tar per cigarette; and (3) a "nicotine-free" cigarette with no more than 0,05 mg of nicotine and 10 mg of tar per cigarette (Vector Tobacco 2004). It was unclear how long.and how often smokers would use the "nicotine-free" version rather than versions that contained higher levels of nicotine and whether the two versions with nicotine would hinder the desire and ability to stop smoking.

Cigarette-Like Products

in ly8fc, kJ. Reynolds launched a new era ox noveT products with Premier, a nicotine-delivering product similar in size and appearance to a conventional cigarette but consisting of an aluminum canister that contained alumina beads impregnated with glycerin, propylene glycol, and a nicotine-rich tobacco extract (Slade 1993; Slade and Henningneld 1993). Heat from a carbon fuel element vaporized material adjacent tn the alumina beads, and these vapors condensed into more proximal segments to form the aerosol that was puffed and inhaled by the consumer (Slade and Henningfkld 1998). Compared with conventional cigarettes, Premier delivered similar doses of nicotine, higher levels of carbon monoxide (CO), and reduced levels of many other toxicants (WHO 2001). Premier was test marketed in the United States in 198o* but was soon withdrawn because of poor sates (Slade and llenningfield 1998).

More recently, tobacco companies have developed several other novel cigarette-like products that deliver nicotine to the consumer (Stratton et al. 2001; Slade et al. 2002). Eclipse (RJ. Reynolds) uses a technology similar to that developed for Premier (Slade and Hen-ningMdd 1998; Slade et al. 2002): the heat source is a carbon fuel element, and nicotine and glycerin are vaporized from an aluminum-lined chamber filled with what the manufacturer described as "highly processed tohacco'* and mixed with glycerin.

cigarettes, a report commissioned by tne Commonwealth of Massachusetts Department of Public Health found that intensive machine smoking of Eclipse delivered levels of key lung and cancer-causing toxicants (e.g., acrolein, CO) similar to, or higher than, those from two commercial cigarette brands (Labstat 2000). A complication in evaluating the toxicity of Eclipse is that several prototypes were test marketed (Slade et aL 2002). It is not clear whether changes not disclosed by the manufacturer account for the variability across studies (Stapleton et al. 1998; Lee et al. 2004; Breland et al. 2006). Nonetheless, it appears that volunteers who had been exposed to Eclipse (Shiffman et al. 2004; Hughes et al. 2005) or had heard of it believed it to be less harmful than conventional cigarettes. Furthermore, concerns have been raised that Eclipse and Premier could be modified to deliver other drugs, including illicit drugs (Cone and Henningfield 1939; Stecktey et al. 2002), Accord (Philip Morris) consists of a specially designed "cigarette" used in combination with an ignition system (Slade and Henningfield 1998). The handheld, battery-operated, microchip-controlled product heats a cigarette-like tobacco roll when it is puffed (Slade and Henningfield 19SJ8), Although actual-use studies of Accord have not been performed, preliminary laboratory studies with volunteers suggest the possibility that actual human exposure to nicotine and toxicants might substantially exceed that predicted by Philip Morris' tests (Buchhalter ct al. 2001; Breland ct al. 2002; Philip Morris USA 2005).

Evaluation of New Cigarette Products

The health consequences of new cigarette products have not been demonstrated in scientific studies. The challenges include a need for development and validation of testing methods for new products (WHO 2004b). Extended noniaboratory studies under natural conditions with a broader range of biomarkers of toxicants are required to determine whether novel products result in overall reduction of exposure to toxicants, and still longer and more extensive studies would be required to determine whether or not the disease risk of the individual or population harm are decreased (WHO 2004a, 2007; Hatsu-kami etal. 2007). For example, products delivering lower levels of mtrosamines might theoretically reduce cancer risks, but because many of these products still deliver nicotine and CO, cardiovascular risks may remain unchanged or may even increase. In addition, if TSNAs are removed, other potent carcinogens may sustain overall high levels of exposure lo carcinogens (Fowles and Dybing 2003).

There are substantial risks that the marketing of novel cigarettes could lead to increased tobacco use in current smokers, relapse in former smokers, and initia> tion in those who never smoked, particularly youth (Hen-ningfield et al. 2003; Hatsukami et ai. 2004a, 2005). For example, in a survey of 1,000 current cigarette smokers and 499 former smokers older than 18 years of age, 91 percent thought Eclipse was safer than regular cigarettes, 24 percent believed Eclipse was completely safe, and 57.4 percent were interested in using the product (Shiff-man etal. 2004). Interest was greatest among those who were contemplating smoking cessation, and exposure to Eclipse's claims was followed by a reduced interest in cessation. Those interested in using Eclipse included 6.2 percent of all former smokers and 15,2 percent of young adults 18 through 25 years of age who had stopped smoking within the past two years. Further extending these findings, Hamilton and colleagues (2004) found that advertisements for light cigarettes were perceived to imply that their use is healthier than use of regular cigarettes, partly because consumers wrongly believed that the advertisements must be approved and endorsed by a government agency.

In addition, products designed or marketed to be used in places where smoking is not allowed may defeat public health efforts to reduce smoking rates. For example, studies have found that having a 100-percent smoke-free workplace reduced smoking prevalence by

6 to 22 percent and average daily consumption by up to 14 percent among smokers compared with workers subject to minimal or no restrictions (Farrelly et at. 1999; NCI 2000; USDHHS 2000; Bonnie et al. 2007). Products that enable nicotine consumption in the workplace and other places could reverse these potential reductions in smoking prevalence through use of one product in the workplace and continued smoking outside, that is, dual product use (Henningficld et al. 2002; European Commission 2007). Moreover, the dual use of tobacco products is likely to result in greater exposure to toxicants than does use of either product type alone (Henningfteld et al. 2002). Balancing the risks and benefit's of new cigarette products is challenging because of the diversity of prod* ucts, their associated potential risks and benefits on the multitude of tobacco-related diseases, and the dearth of empirical data on their effects. The 2001 Iastitute of Medicine (IOM) report (Stratton et al. 2001) and a report from the University of Minnesota Transdisciplinary Tobacco Use Research Center raised a series of questions about these and similar products (Hughes 2000; Stratton et al. 2001; Hatsukami and Hecht 2005; Hatsukami et al, 2005), WHO developed similar scientific questions, as well as recommendations for research and product testing {Wl 10 2003d, 2004a, 2006,2007). Although all the questions raised by these organizations merit consideration, the following questions are a critical starting point for evaluating new cigarette or cigarette-like products:

�   Does use of the product decrease individual and population exposure to the harmful substances in tobacco smoke?

�   Is this decreased exposure associated with a decrease in individual and population risk of disease?

�   Are there surrogate indicators of disease risk that could be measured in a timeframe of sufficient duration for product evaluation?

�   What are the public health implications of products that may reduce exposure to toxicants in tobacco smoke? Specifically, do these product* increase initiation of tobacco use, decrease cessation, promote relapse among those who have quit, or lead to dual product use?

New Oversight of Tobacco Products

On June 22, 2609, President Barack Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Public Law 111-31). The Tobacco Control Act grants the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect the pubbVs health and recognizes FDA as the primary federal regulatory authority with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. Key elements of the act include, among other things, creation of a new Center for Tobacco Products, prohibition of the sale of cigarettes containing certain characterizing flavors, the requirement that manufacturers and importers report to FDA tiie ingredients and additives in their products, strengthened warning labels with graphic images of the adverse effects of cigarette use, and oversight of the tobacco industry's efforts to develop and market potential reduced-exposure tobacco products. The Tobacco Control Act also requires FDA to reissue the agency's 1996 regulation aimed at reducing young people's access to tobacco products and curbing the appeal of tobacco to the young. Although some provisions of the act went into effect shortly after the statute was enacted, such as the ban on

2007, or modified after that date) to submit an application containing specified manufacturing and ingredient information, as well as studies of the product's health risks, for FDA review. After reviewing the application, the agency will issue an order either permitting the product to be marketed or denying its marketing according to specified bases for its action. New tobacco products determined by FDA to be substantially equivalent tu products already on the market as of February 15, 2007, are not required to undergo premarket review.

Section 91J provides that "modified risk tobacco products" may only be marketed if FDA determines, after reviewing a product application, that the product will significantly reduce the risk of tobacco-related disease to individual users, and benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into account the impact on both users and nonusers of tobacco products. Section 911 recognizes so-called special rule products, which also require premarket approval. Such products may be marketed for up to five years (subject to renewal) if the agency determines that the applicant has met specified criteria, the applicant agrees to conduct certain postmarket surveillance and

flavored cigarettes, others will be implemented over time. Sections 910 and 911 of the Tobacco Control Act provide that premarket review of certain tobacco products by FDA is required before the products may be marketed. Section 910 requires manufacturers of new tobacco products (those not commercially marketed as of February 15,

studies, and other specified findings regarding the relative harm of the product are made. Under this section, FDA must issue guidance or regulations on the scientific evidence required for the assessment and ongoing review of modifkd-risk tobacco products in consultation with K)M.

Summary

lb reduce smoking-attributable death and disease, public health efforts since the 1964 Surgeon General's report on smoking and health have focused on reducing the prevalence of tobacco use. Reduced prevalence has been achieved through efforts to prevent tobacco use and promote cessation; this effort has been termed one of the "ten great public health achievements of the twentieth century* {CDC 1999). At the time the adverse effects of smoking were being recognized, the tobacco industry developed cigarettes with low machine-measured yields of tar and nicotine, and public health authorities encouraged consumers to select them (Peeler 1996; Shopland 2001). Unfortunately, it took public health researchers and federal authorities many years to discover what the tobacco industry knew much earlier: the health benefits

20  Chapter 2

of reductions of tar and nicotine intakes were negligible at best for persons using these products (Federal Register 1995,1996; NCI 2001; WHO 2001; US. v. Philip Morris No. 449 F. Supp. 2d 1,430-75 [D.D.C. 2006]). In 2001, an NCI report concluded: "There is no convincing evidence that changesin cigarette design between 1950andthemid 1960s have resulted in an important decrease in the disease burden caused by cigarette use either for smokers as a group or for the entire population" (NCI 2001, p. 146), Thus, by the twenty-first century, it was apparent that five decades of evolving cigarette design had not reduced overall disease risk among smokers, and new designs were used by the tobacco industry as a tool to undermine prevention and cessation efforts (NCI 2001; Stratton et al. 2001; WHO 2001,2003a,b,c; USDHHS 2004).

Similarly, informative and comprehensive scientific evaluations do not exist for any of the other new products developed ostensibly to reduce toxicants in cigarette smoke. This lack of data limits any conclusions that can be drawn about potential health risks or benefits.

The well-documented risks of cigarette design changes must be weighed against any potential benefits (Stratton et al. 2001). As this chapter makes clear, substantial risks may be associated with new tobacco products: (1) smokers who might have otherwise stopped smoking may continue to smoke because of perceived reduction in risk with use of new products; (2) former smokers may resume smoking because of perceived reduction m risk with use of new products; and (3) nonsmokers, particularly youth, may start to use new products because

of their perceived safety. The theoretical benefit of cigarette design changes is to reduce exposure to toxicants sufficiently to reduce the risk of disease and death. However, if these products are used by persons otherwise unlikely to use a tobacco product, which would undermine efforts to prevent tobacco use, or if the products delay cessation among persons who would otherwise stop using tobacco, the overall health of the population would be harmed.

There is little doubt that new tobacco products will continue to be developed. Consequently, there is a critical need to conduct independent research on the design, composition, and health effects of new cigarette products and to put in place a comprehensive surveillance system to understand consumers' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors regarding these products,

Introduction

Nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason that individuals persist in using tobacco products, and this persistent tobacco use contributes to many diseases described in this report. The 198fl report, The Health Consequences of Smoking: Nicotine Addiction: A Report of the Surgeon General (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USD! II IS] 1983, p. 9), describes the pharmacologic basis of tobacco addiction and arrives at three major conclusions:

1. Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting.

Kandel et aL 1997). Any efforts to reduce tobacco-related disease must take into account the addiction potential of a tobacco product.

Since the 1988 Surgeon General's report was published, significant advances have been made in understanding the physiological effects of nicotine and the basis for addiction:

1. identifying specific genotypes and receptor subtypes that may contribute to and play an important role in nicotine addiction,

2.  Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction.

3.  The pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction arc similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine.

Tobacco addiction remains a substantial problem in the United States and worldwide. Of those individuals who "have ever tried smoKing, about one-third become daily" smokers {USJDHHS 1994, p. 67). Of those smokers who try to quit, less than 5 percent are successful at any one time (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC] 2002, 2004). Although not all smokers become nicotine dependent, the prevalence of individuals diagnosed as nicotine dependent is higher than that for any other substance abuse disorder (Anthony et al. 1994; CDC 1995b;

2.  observing sensitivities and responses to nicotine in adolescents that might make them more susceptible to nicotine addiction than adults are and recognizing the different trajectories for the development of nicotine dependence,

3.  developing a greater awareness of the important role of associative learning in addiction,

4.  recognizing the strong associations between smok-mgand comorbid psyduatriclisorders, and

5.  achieving a better understanding of the relapse and recovery processes.

The goals of this chapter are to describe these advances and their implications and to discuss future directions.

Definition of Nicotine Addiction

The crux of understanding the pathophysiology of tobacco addiction and its measurement relies on the identification of critical characteristics and the definition of addiction, This area continues to evolve, and significant gaps in research are evident. There is no established consensus on criteria for diagnosing nicotine addiction. However, researchers have identified several symptoms as indicators of addiction. The 19S8 Surgeon General's report lists the following general "criteria for drug dependence," including nicotine dependence (USDHfiS 1988, p. 7}:

Primary Criteria

�   Highly controlled or compulsive use

�   Psychoactive effects

�    Drug-reinforced behavior

Additional Criteria

�   Addictive behavior, often involves:

- stereotypic patterns of use

- use despite harmful effects

- relapse following abstinence

- recurrent drug cravings

Message from Kathleen Sebelius

Secretary of Health and Human Services

Fifty years after the release of the first Surgeon General's report warning of the health hazards of smoking, we have learned how to end the tobacco epidemic. Over the past five decades, scientists, researchers and policy makers have determined what works, and what steps must be taken if we truly want to bring to a close one of our nation's most tragic battles�one that has killed ten times the number of Americans who died in all of our nation's wars combined.

In the United States, successes in tobacco control have more than halved smoking rates since the 1964 landmark Surgeon General's report came out Americans' collective view of smoking has been transformed from an accepted national pastime to a discouraged threat to individual and public health. Strong policies have largely driven cigarette smoking out of public view and public air space. Thanks to smokefree laws, no longer is smoking allowed on airplanes or in a growing number of restaurants, bars, college campuses and government buildings.

Evidence in this new report shows tobacco's continued, immense burden to our nation^and how essential ending the tobacco epidemic is to our work to increase the life expectancy and quality of life of all Americans. This year alone, nearly one-half million adults will still die prematurely because of smoking. Annually, the total economic costs due to tobacco are now over $289 billion. And if we continue on our current trajectory, 5.6 million children alive today who are younger than 18 years of age will die prematurely as a result of smoking.

1 believe that we can make the next generation tobacco-free. And 1 am extremely proud of the Ohama Administration's tobacco-control record. For example, the 20(H) Children's Health Insurance -programRimnrfmrizntionAdincludedanajiprEmicnted^C^'tax

excise tax to $1.01 per pack of cigarettes; we know that increasing the cost of cigarettes is one of the most powerful interventions we can make to prevent smoking and reduce prevalence. Building on this knowledge, the President's Fiscal Year 2014 Budget includes a $0.94 per pack Federal tobacco tax increase. For the first time in history, the 2009 Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) #ave the U.S. Food and Drug Administration comprehensive authority to regulate tobacco products, which will play a critical role in reducing the harm caused by these products. The Tbbacco Control Act also provided for user fees to be paid by tobacco manufacturers that can support sustained public education media campaigns targeting youth prevention and cessation. The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) expands access to smoking cessation services and now requires most insurance companies to cover cessation treatments. The Affordable Care Act's Public Health and Prevention Pund is supporting innovative and effective community-based programs as well as public education campaigns promoting prevention and helping people to quit

All of these tobacco control interventions arc known to reduce tobacco use and, as a result, tobacco's extraordinary toll of death and disease. But in order to free the next generation from these burdens, w� must redouble our tobacco control efforts and enlist nongovernmental partners�and society as a whole�to share in this responsibility. Ending the devastation of tobacco-related illness and death is not in the jurisdiction of any one entity. We must all share in this most worthwhile effort to end the tobacco epidemic.

Message from Howard Koh

Assistant Secretary for Health

The nation stands poised at the crossroads of tobacco control. On one hand, we can celebrate tremendous progress 50 years after the landmark 1964 Surgeon General's report: Smoking and Health. Adult smoking rates have fallen from about 43% (1965) to about 18% today. Mortality rates from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in this country, are declining. Most smokers visiting health care settings are now routinely asked and advised about tobacco use. On the other hand, cigarette smoking remains the chief preventable killer in America, with more than 40 million Americans aught in a web of tobacco dependence. Each day, more than 3,200 youth (younger than 18 years of age) smoke their first cigarette ami another 2,100 youth and young adults who are occasional smokers progress to become daily smokers. Furthermore, the range of emerging tobacco products complicates the current public health landscape.

In this context, the 50th Anniversary of the Surgeon General's report prompts us to pause and ask why this addiction persists when proven interventions can eliminate it. Of great concern, too many in our nation assume that past success in tobacco control guarantees future progress; nothing can be further from the truth. To rejuvenate and reinvigorate national efforts, in 2010, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services unveiled its first ever strategic plan for tobacco control. Ending the Tbbacco Epidemic A Tobacco Control Strategic Action Plan provides a critical framework to guide efforts to rapidly drop prevalence rates of smoking among youth and adults. A major foundation and pillar of the plan is to encourage and promote leadership throughout all sectors of society. Now, this current 2014 Surgeon CeneraPs report can accelerate that leadership to fully implement the life-saving -prevenitionihatianTna^the-rrCTt generation free oftohacco=rdated-deathrand disease:------------------

We have many tools that we know work. A comprehensive public policy approach emphasising mass media campaigns to encourage prevention and quit attempts, smokefree policies, restrictions on youth access to tobacco products, and price increases can collectively drive further meaningful reductions in tobacco use. Furthermore, we can accelerate progress through full commitment to clinical and public health advances; including the widespread use of telephone quit lines and science-based counseling and medications for tobacco users. Promoting progress today also requires recognising that tobacco use has evolved from being an equal-opportunity killer to one threatening the most vulnerable members of our society. We must confront, and reverse, the tragically higher tobacco use rates that threaten persons of low socioeconomic status, sexual minorities, high school dropouts, some racial/ ethnic minority groups, and those living with mental illness and substance use disorders.

Of all the accomplishments of the 20lh century, historians rank the 1964 Surgeon General's report as one of the seminal public health achievements of our time, Armed with both science and resolve, we can continue to honor the legacy of the report by completing the work il began in the last century, The current 2014 Surgeon General's report represents a national vision for getting the job done. With strategy, commitment, and action, our nation can leave the crossroads and move forward to end the tobacco epidemic once and for all.

Foreword

Fifty years have passed since publication of the landmark report of the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on smoking and health. This report highlights both the dramatic progress our nation has made reducing tobacco use and the continuing burden of disease and death caused by smoking.

As a physician, when I think about smoking, I recall the patients I have cared for. The man who had a leg amputated. The woman who had to gasp for every single breath that she took. The man with heart disease who hoped to see his son graduate, but didn't live long enough to do so. Thafs the reality of smoking that health care providers see every day.

The prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults has declined from 42% in 1965 to 18% in 2012, However, more than 42 million Americans still smoke. Tobacco has killed more than 20 million people prematurely since the first Surgeon General's report in 1964. The findings in this report show that the decline in the prevalence of smoking has slowed in recent years and that burden of smoking-attributable mortality is expected to remain at high and unacceptable levels for deades to come unless urgent action is taken.

Recent surveys monitoring trends in tobacco "use indicate that more people are using multiple tobacco products, particularly youth and young adults. The percentage of U.S. middle and high school students who use electronic, or e-cigarettes, more than doubled between 2011 and 2012. We need to monitor patterns of use of an increasingly wide array of tobacco products across all of the diverse segments of our society, particularly because the tobacco industry continues to introduce and market new products that establish and maintain nicotine addiction.

*~- '"^TOtracco control el tons need to not only audrcss me general popmatron^miirai.'io to focus on populations with a higher prevalence of tobacco use and lower rates of quitting. These populations include people from some racial/ethnic minority groups, people with mental illness, lower educational levels and socioeconomic status, and certain regions of the country. We now have proven interventions and policies to reduce tobacco initiation and use among youth and adults.

With intense use of proven interventions, we can save lives and reduce health care costs. In 2012, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) launched the first-ever paid national tobacco education campaign�Tips From Former Smokers {Tips) � to raise awareness of the harms to health caused by smoking, encourage smokers to quit, and encourage nonsmokers to protect themselves and their families from expasure to secondhand smoke. It pulled back the curtain in a way that numbers alone cannot, and showed the tobacco-caused tragedies that we as health care professionals see and are saddened by every day. As a result of this campaign, an estimated 1.6 million smokers made an attempt to quit and, based on a conservative estimate, at least 100,000 smokers quit for good. Additionally, millions of nonsmokers talked with friends and family about the dangers of smoking and referred smokers to quit services. In 2013, CDC launched a new round of advertisements that helped even more people (fljit smoking by highlighting the toll that smoking-related illnesses take on smokers and their loved ones.

CDC has also established reducing tobacco use as one of its "Winnable Battles." These are public health priorities with large-scale impact on health that have proven effective strategies to address them. CDC believes that with additional effort and support for evidence' based, cost-effective policy and program strategies to reduce tobacco use, we can reduce smoking substantially, prevent millions of people from being killed by tobacco, and protect future generations from smoking.

While we have made tremendous progress over the past 50 years, sustained and comprehensive efforts are needed to prevent more people from having to suffer the pain, disafaility, disfigurement, and death that smoking causes. Most Americans who have evtr smoked have already qtiit; and most smokers who still smoke want to quit. If we continue to implement tobacco prevention and cessation strategies that have proven effective in reducing tobacco use, people throughout our country will live longer, healthier, more productive lives.

Preface

from the Acting Surgeon General, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services

On January 11,1964, Luther L. Terry, M.D., the 9th Surgeon Genera! of the United States, released the first report on the health consequences of smoking: Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee of the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service. That report marked a major step to reduce the adverse impact of tobacco use on health worldwide.

Over the past 50 years, 31 Surgeon General's reports have utilized the best available evidence to expand our understanding of the health consequences of smoking and involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke. The conclusions from these reports have evolved from a few causal associations in 1964 to a robust body of evidence documenting the health consequences from both active smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke across a range of diseases and organ systems.

The 2004 report concluded that smoking affects nearly every organ of the body, and the evidence in this report provides even more support for that finding. A half century after the release of the first report, we continue to add to the long list of diseases caused by tobacco use and exposure to tobacco smoke. This report finds that active smoking is now causally associated with age-related macular degeneration, diabetes, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, adverse health outcomes in cancer patients and survivors, tuberculosis, erectile dysfunction, orofacial clefts in Infants, ectopic pregnancy, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammation, and impaired immune function. In addition, exposure to secondhand smoke lias now been causally associated with an increased risk for stroke.

Smoking remains the leading preventable cause of premature disease and death in the United Statev The &cieuciri^mt7imedintJii5'aTrf'rjifiui 8u�geon General's reports utuvide all tin; information we need to save future generations from the burden of premature disease caused by tobacco use. However, evidence-based interventions that encourage quitting and prevent youth smoking continue to be underutilized. This report strengthens our resolve to work together to accelerate and sustain what works�such as hard-hitting media campaigns, smokefree air policies, optimal tobacco excise taxes, barrier-free cessation treatment, and comprehensive statewide tobacco control programs funded at CDC-recomme.nded levels. At the same time, we will explore "end game" strategies that support the goal of eliminating tobacco smoking, including greater restrictions on sales, It is my sincere hope that 50 years from now we won't need another Surgeon General's report on smoking and health, because tobacco-related disease and death will be a thing of the past. Working together, we can make that vision a reality.

The Health Consequences of Smoking�50 Years of Progress

Introduction

On January 11, 1964, Luther L. Terry, M,D� Surgeon General of the United States, released Smoking and Hmltk Report of the Advisory Committee of the Surgeon General of the Public Health Seivice. This report, written at the request of President John R Kennedy, was in response to the evidence on smoking and lung cancer that had been accumulating since the 1950s (see Chapter 2, "Fifty Years of Change 1964-2014"). This was the first in the series that is now generally referred to as the Surgeon General's reports. On the basis of more than 7,000 articles in the biomedical literature relating to smoking and disease that were available at the time, the Advisory Committee concluded that cigarette smoking is:

�   Associated with 70% higher all-cause mortality rates among men

�   A cause of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer in men

�   A probable cause of lung cancer in women

�   The most important came of chronic bronchitis.

(U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare [USDHEWI1964).

For several days, the report was the topic of newspaper headlines across the country and lead stories on television newscasts (Parascandola 1957). Later, it was ranked among the top news stories of the 20th century (USA Today 199*)). The release of that report was one of the first in a series of steps, still being taken 50 years later, to diminish the impact of tobacco use on the health of people worldwide. Ever since, individual citizens, private organizations, public agencies, and elected officials have pursued the Advisory CommiLtee's call for "appropriate remedial action."

Early on, in response to the 1964 report, the U.S. Congress passed the/Werd1Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 and the ihibtk Health Cigarette Smok-

ing Act of1969. These laws required a health warning on cigarette packages, banned cigarette advertising in the broadcasting media, and called for an annual report on the health consequences of smoking. Since then, there have been several actions at the federal level�the enactment of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Ad in 2009, and the publication of Ending the Tobacco Epidemic: A Tobacco Control Strategic Plan for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (USDHHS 2010a).

Since that first report in 1964, knowledge of the Iwalth consequences of smoking and involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke has expanded dramatically (see Chapter 4, "Advances in Knowledge on the Health Consequences of Smoking: From 1964-2014"). This series of reports has provided definitive syntheses of the evolving evidence on smoking and health. The topics have ranged widely, including comprehensive coverage of the adverse health effects of active smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke (USD1IEW 1979; U.S. Department of Health and Human Services [USDHHS] 1986, 2004, 2006), the JrjqpactaU:ohaccQ-controUpolides4USDHHS 2Q0ii)y-aiad-addiction (USDHHS 1988). A goal of these reports has been to synthesize available evidence to reach conclusions on causality that have public health implications. In reaching conclusions on causation, the reports have followed a model that originated with the 1964 report: compilation of all relevant tines of scientific evidence, critical assessment of the evidence, evaluation of the strength of evidence by using guidelines for evidence evaluation, and a summary conclusion on causation (USDHEW 19fi4; USDHHS 2004; Table 1.1; Chapter 3, "Producing the Surgeon General's Report from 1964-2014: Process and Purpose"). The Surgeon General's reports have established a long list of health consequences and diseases caused by tobacco usu and exposure to tobacco smoke (see Chapter 4). Fifty years later, this report documents that our knowledge continues to expand as new causal conclusions arc still being added to that long list (Figures 1.1A and 1.1B).

Organization of the Report

This report is divided into three sections. Section 1 'Historical perspective, overview, and conclusions" provides an overall summary of the report and its conclusions. It also provides a summary of the history of this series of reports, moving from their origins in 1964 to the present, contrasting what wc knew in 1964 with what we know now in 2014, Section 2 The Health Consequences of Active and Passive Smoking: The Evidence in 2014'* provides a direct link to the 1964 report, which addressed the health effects of active smoking only. The first chapter

in this section gives a 50-year perspective on the identification of the health consequences of active smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. The other chapters in this section provide updates on critical topics and on topics for which the evidence has advanced, since the previous reviews in the 2004 and 2006 Surgeon General's reports, The Health Consequences of Smoking: A Report of the Swgeon General and The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General, including a brief review of the state of

Understanding of mechanisms, as laid out in the 2010 report, How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease: The Biology and Behavioral Basis for Smoking-Attributable Disease, is also (USDHHS 2010b). Active smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke are covered in the same chapters. Section 3 "TVacking and Ending the Epidemic" includes a descriptive chapter on the pattern* of smoking, a chapter on the impact of the tobacco control environment on smoking since 1964. and additional chapters providing estimates of premature deaths that are avoidable.

The final chapter "A Vision for the Ending the Tobacco Epidemic" outlines broad strategies and potential courses of action for tobacco control in the future,

Each section within the chapters on the health consequences of smoking (Chapters 6 - 11) is accompanied by evidence tables detailing the studies that were used to evaluate the evidence to assess causality.

Surgeon General's Report

Development of the Report

The Surgeon General's reports on smoking and health were previously mandated by the Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, Public Law 91-222, section 8 (a), which required that The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare shall transmit a report to Congress not later than January 1,1971, and annually thereafter, concerning (A) current information in the health consequences of smoking, and (B) such recommendations for legislation as he may deem appropriate." In addition, recent reports have also satisfied the statutory reporting required by the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, Public Law 99-252, which required that "The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall transmit a report to Congress no later than January 11,1987, and biennially thereafter, containing�(1) a description of the effects of health education efforts on the use of smokeless tobacco products, (2) a description of the use by the public of smokeless tobacco products, (3) an evaluation of the health effects of smokeless tobacco products and the identification of areas appropriate for further research, and (4) such recommendation for legislation and administrative -adion-acUhe-Secrfttary consider* appropriate/' These itat-utory requirements were sunsetted in 1999 and an annua! report to Congress is no longer required by law.

Initially, the annual reports to Congress on the health consequences of smoking were prepared by the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health; however, in 1978 Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph Califano established the Office on Smoking and Health in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Health to coordinate dw production of the annual report to Congress that would review not only the biomedical but also the behavioral and control data about smoking and its effects on health. The fifteenth anniversary report (USD-HEW 1979) was the first report produced by the Office on Smoking and Health (see Mk 3.1 for a full listing of reports from 1964-2012).

Beginning with Dr. Luther L Terry, each Surgeon General has released the reports to the public and served as the primary spokesperson of the findings. However, the preparation of these reports, starting with the 1964 Advisory Committee, has been conducted with a high degree of independence, in order to protect their scientific integrity. Although the public may assume that the individual Surgeon Generals have been active in the authoring of the reports, their role has remained largely at the level of approving topics and reviewing drafts before the volume is published. Nevertheless, over time, the Office of

the Surgeon General has increasingly become involved in developing the messaging for the public release of the reports. Consistent with a primary duty of the Surgeon General to "Protect and advance the health of the Nation through educating the public, advocating for effective disease prevention and health promotion programs and activities, and, providing a highly recognized symbol of national commitment to protecting and improving the public's health," the Office of the Surgeon General (n.d.) has expanded the range of educational materials support* ing the release of the scientific report, particularly the development of a consumer summary which is produced tn nontechnical but scientifically valid language.

As shown in Table 3.1, over time the size of the reports has grown, largely due to the increase in scientific literature on the topics reviewed, but also as the scope of topics has grown from those addressed in the initial charge provided by Secretary Califano in 1979 to address the behavioral and tobacco control aspects of the problem. This broader focus is reflected in the 2012 report which reviewed not only the epidemiology, causes, and health -effects-of- tobacco-use-among- youth -arwt-yoiaig aduUsr but also the interventions proven to prevent this problem (USDHHS 20121.

This report of the Surgeon General was prepared by the Office on Smoking and Health, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USDHHS. Initial chapters were written between 2010-2011 by 75 experts selected because of their knowledge of, and familiarity with, the topics presented here. These contributions are summarized in 15 chapters, which were evaluated by more man 100 peer reviewers. The entire manuscript was then sent to more than 20 scientists and other experts, who examined it for scientific integrity. After each review cycle, the drafts were revised by the editors on the basis of the reviewers' comments. Subsequently, the report was reviewed by various institutes and agencies within USDHHS, Publication lags, even short ones, prevent an up-to-the-minute inclusion of all recently published articles and data. Therefore, by the time the public reads this report, additional studies or data may have been published.

The methodology for evidence compilation, review, and synthesis draws on the approach of the 1964 Surgeon General's report (USDHEW 1964), as further modified in the 2004 report (USDHHS 2004). That report also refined the methodology for causal inference and set out a classification of strength of evidence for causal inference.

Scientific Basis of the Report

The Health Consequences ofSmokingL�5Q Years of Progress

The statements and conclusions throughout this report are documented hy the citation of studies published in the scientific literature. For the most part, this report cites peer-reviewed journal articles, including reviews that integrate findings /rom numerous studies, and books by recognized experts. When a study has been accepted for publication, but the publication has not yet been issued,

owing to the delay between acceptance and final publication, the study is referred to as "in press." This report also refers, on occasion, to unpublished research such as a presentation at a professional meeting or a personal communication from the researcher. These personal references are to acknowledge experts whose research is in progress.

Major Conclusions from the Report

1,     The century-long epidemic of cigarette smoking has caused an enormous avoidable public health tragedy. Since the first Surgeon General's report in 1964 more than 20 mill ion premature deaths can be attributed to cigarette smoking.

2.    The tobacco epidemic was initiated and has been sustained by the aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry, which has deliberately misled (hepuHRcon the risks of smoking cigarettes.

7.

In addition to causing multiple diseases, cigarette smoking has many other adverse effects on the body, such as causing inflammation and impairing immune function.

Although cigarette smoking has declined significantly since 1964, very large disparities in tobacco use remain across groups defined by race, ethnicity, edu-'miimirfevef, ar^socioeconomic status and across" regions of the country.

4.

5.

Since the 1964 Surgeon General's report, cigarette 8. smoking has been causally linked to diseases of nearly all organs of the body, to diminished health status, and to harm to the fetus. Even 50 years alter the first Surgeon General's report, research continues to newly identify diseases caused by smoking, including such common diseases as diabetes mellitus, rheuma- 9, toid arthritis, and colorectal cancer.

Exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke has been causally linked to cancer, respiratory, and cardiovascular diseases, and to adverse effects on the health of infants and children.                                                    10.

The disease risks from smoking by women have risen sharply over the last 50 years and are now equal to those for men for lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular diseases.

Since the 1964 Surgeon General's report, comprehensive tobacco control programs and policies have been proven effective for controlling tobacco use. Further gains can be made with the full, forceful, and sustained use of these measures.

The hurden of death and disease from tobacco use in the United States is overwhelmingly caused by cigarettes and other combusted tobacco products; rapid elimination nf their use will dramatically reduce this burden.

For SO years the Surgeon General's reports on smoking and health have provided a critical scientific foundation for public health action directed at reducing tobacco use and preventing tobacco-related disease and premature death.

Chapter 5: Nicotine

1.    The evidence is sufficient to infer that at high-enough doses nicotine has acute toxicity.

2.    The evidence is sufficient to infer that nicotine activates multiple biological pathways through which smoking increases risk for disease.

3.    The evidence is sufficient to infer that nicotine exposure during fetal development, a critical window for brain development, has lasting adverse consequences for brain development.

4.    The evidence is sufficient to infer that nicotine adversely affects maternal and fetal health during pregnancy, contributing to multiple adverse outcomes such as preterm delivery and stillbirth.

5.    The evidence is suggestive that nicotine exposure during adolescence, a critical window for brain development, may have lasting adverse consequences for brain development

6.    The evidence is inadequate to infer the presence or absence of a causal relationship between exposure to nicotine and risk for cancer.

Lung Cancer

1.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that the risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the lung from cigarette smoking lias increased since the 1960s.

2.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that the increased risk of adenocarcinoma of the lung in smokers results from changes in the design and composition of cigarettes since the 1950s.

3.    The evidence is not sufficient to specify which design changes are responsible for the increased risk of adenocarcinoma, but there is suggestive evidence that ventilated filters and increased levels of tobacco-specific nitrosamines have played a role.

4.    The evidence shows that the decline of squamous cell carcinoma follows the trend of declining smoking prevalence.

Chapter 12: Smoking-Attributable Morbidity, Mortality, and Economic Costs

1.    Since the first Surgeon General's report on smoking and health in 1964, there have been more than 20 million premature deaths attributable to smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. Smoking remains the leading preventable cause of premature death in the United States.

2.    Despite declines in the prevalence of current smoking, the annual burden of smoking-attributable mortality in the United States has remained above 400,000 for more than a decade and currently is estimated to be about 480,000, with millions more living with smok-ing-related diseases.

3.    Due to the slow decline in the prevalence of current smoking, the annual burden of smoking-attributable mortality can be expected to remain at high levels for decades into the future, with 5.6 million youth currently 0 to 17 years of age projected to die prematurely from a smoking-related illness.

4.    Annual smoking-attributable economic costs in the United States estimated for the years 2009-2012 were between $289-332.5 billion, including $132.5-175.9 billion for direct medical care of adults, $151 billion for lost productivity due to premature death estimated from 2005-2009, and $5.6 billion (in 2006) for lost productivity due to exposure to secondhand smoke.

J. In the United States, the prevalence of current cigarette smoking among adults has declined from 42% in 1965 to 18% in 2012.

2.    Thf, PTffvakflce of currfrntcig&rfttta smoking declined first among men (between 1965 and the 1990s), and then among women (since the 1980s). However, declines in the prevalence of smoking among adults (18 years of age and older) have slowed in recent years.

3.    Most first use of cigarettes occurs by 18 years of age (87%), with nearly all first use by 26 years of age (98%),

4.    Very large disparities in tobacco use remain across racial/ethnic groups and between groups defined by educational level, socioeconomic status, and region.

5.    In the United States, there are now more former smokers than there are current smokers. More than half* of all ever smokers have quit smoking,

6.    The rate of quitting smoking among recent birth cohorts has been increasing, and interest in quitting is high across all segments of society.

7.    Patterns of tobacco use are changing, with more intermittent use of cigarettes and an increase in use of other products.

Chapter 14: Current Status of Tobacco Control

1.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude mat there are diverse tobacco control measures of proven efficacy at the population and individual levels.

2.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that advertising and promotional activities by the tobacco companies cause the onset and continuation of smoking among adolescents and young adults.

3.    Tobacco product regulation has the potential to contribute to public health through reductions in tobacco product addictiveness and hannfulncss, and by preventing false or misleading claims by the tobacco industry of reduced risk.

4.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that litigation against tobacco companies has reduced tobacco use in the United States by leading to increased product prices, restrictions on marketing methods, and making available industry documents for scientific analysis and strategic awareness.

6.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that smokefree indoor air policies are effective in reducing exposure to secondhand smoke and lead to less smoking among covered individuals,

7.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that mass media campaigns, comprehensive community programs, and comprehensive statewide tobacco control programs prevent initiation of tobacco use and reduce the prevalence of tobacco use among youth and adults.

8.    The evidence is sufficient to conclude that tobacco cessation treatments are effective across a wide population of smokers, including those with significant mental and physical comorbidity.

1.    Together, experience since 1964 and results from models exploring future scenarios of tobacco control indicate that the decline in tobacco use over coming decades will not be sufficiently rapid to meet targets. The goal of ending the tragic burden of avoidable disease and premature death will not be met quickly enough without additional action.

Implementing tobacco control policies and programs as recommended by Ending tha 'Shbacco Epidemic: A Tbbacco Control Strategic Plan by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Ending the Tobacco Problem: A Blueprint for the Nation by the Institute of Medicine on a sustained basis at high intensity would accelerate the decline of tobacco use in youth and adults, and also accelerate progress toward Ihe goal of ending the tobacco epidemic.

New "end game" strategies have been proposed with the goal of eliminating tobacco smoking. Some of these strategies may prove useful for the United States, particularly reduction of the nicotine content of tobacco products and greater restrictions on sales (including bans on entire categories of tobacco products),

I.     Executive Summary

Menthol is widely used in consumer and medicinal products and has long been used in cigarettes, often as a flavor-characterizing additive. In medical products, menthol is regulated as a drug with restrictions on allowable doses and use. There are no product standards for menthoi when used in cigarettes.

Approximately one-fourth of all cigarettes sold in the United States are menthol (Giovino, 2004). The vast majority (88%) of adult smokers in the United States start to smoke before age 18 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2012). Thus, youth and young adulthood appear to be a critical age-span for initiation of cigarette smoking, and research suggests that menthol cigarettes may have an impact on initiation rates that differ from nonmenthol cigarettes. Further, the impact of menthol cigarettes on dependence, cessation, and health risks has been the topic of scientific inquiry and intense debate.

The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (Section 907 (e)) requires FDA's Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) to submit a report and recommendation to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on public health- including use among children, women, African Americans, Hispanics, and other racial or etlmio minorities--- by March 23,2011. In March 2010, TPSAC began its process of reviewing the available evidence as well as soliciting and receiving valuable input from researchers, tobacco industry representatives, consultants to the tobacco industry, representatives of the public health sector, and others. On July 21,2011, TPSAC voted on its final report and recommendations on menthol, which concluded "removal of menthol cigarettes from the marketplace would benefit public health in the United States." TPSAC noted that a variety of options were available for FDA to consider, and they made no specific suggestions for foilow-up by FDA should the agency decide it should pursue this recommendation. In addition, the non-voting industry representatives of TPSAC submitted a separate document reflecting the industry perspective. That document acknowledged the inherent risks of all tobacco products, including those that have menthol as a characterizing flavor, and raised the possibility of countervailing effects, including potential risks of contraband menthol products, should a ban be imposed.

Independently, FDA has undertaken a thorough review of the available science concerning menthol cigarettes. To accomplish this task, FDA weighed the collective body of evidence for the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on public health. One of the tirst considerations in weighing the value of a particular study was the relevance of the information to the consumption of menthol cigarettes in the United States. Findings that were replicated in different studies, especially different types of studies, were given greater weight. FDA also considered the source of uiforraation, the type of study, and the quality of study methods and data. In drawing conclusions, more consideration was given to peer-reviewed studies, studies in humans, and studies that were appropriately powered and designed. In this process, FDA evaluated the peer- reviewed literature, industry submissions and other materials provided to TPSAC, and performed or commissioned additional analyses in an attempt to fill in and inform some of the gaps in the literature.
pgNbr=698
In making its assessment, FDA used a "weight of scientific evidence" approach. Studies were evaluated to determine the strength of both negative and positive associations of menthol in cigarettes with the impact under consideration. Scientific determinations fell into one of five categories, where x is the impact under consideration;

�    The weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is associated withx

�     The weight of evidence supports the cone lusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with x

�    The weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely not associated withx

�    The weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is not associated with x

�    The evidence is not sufficient to support a conclusion of an association of menthol in cigarettes withx

The purpose of this evaluation was to determine whether there arc independent associations between menthol in cigarettes and various outcomes of interest. In doing so, FDA evaluated the weight of evidence, taking into account potential threats to validity^ such as bias or confounding, and whether the findings were generali/able to the U.S. population The evaluations were not an attempt to establish causality. In reviewing the science of menthol smoking, FDA divided the scientific evidence into the following broad categories:

Smoke Chemistry and Nonclinical Toxicology: This review assessed information on in vitro and in vivo studies, as well as studies that examined menthol alone or tobacco smoke from menthol cigarettes. Two particular areas of interest were the comparison of menthol to nonmenthol cigarettes and whether the addition of menthol impacted the presence and levels of harmful and potential harmful constituents in the smoke. The studies examined did not show increased toxicity in menthol cigarettes compared to the already-toxic nonmenthol cigarettes. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that, from a nonclinical toxicity standpoint, menthol in cigarettes is not associated with increased or decreased smoke toxicity.

Physiology: FDA considered information on menthol's effect on cooling, desensitization, anesthesia, and potential effect on nicotine and tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs). FDA reviewed both /// vitro and in vivo studies in human and animal models. In addition, analysts reviewed studies looking at the effect of menthol on smoking topography. There are some /// vivo and in vitro studies that show menthol has cooling, desensitizating, and proanaJgesic effects. Menthol acts primarily through receptors on sensory nerves. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with altered physiological responses to tobacco smoke.

Biomarkcrs: FDA analyzed studies measuring biomarkers of exposure in smokers of menthol and nonmenthol cigarettes. BiomarkcTS included levels of smoke constituents or their

plasma carboxyhcmoglobin (COHb) for levels of CO exposure; cotinine (main nicotine
pgNbr=699
metabolite) and other nicotine equivalents in plasma and urine for exposure to nicotine. Some studies show that smoking menthol cigarettes modulates the exposure or metabolism of nicotine and tobacco-specific nilrosamincs (TSNAs), while other studies tail to show a significant association. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely not associated with increased or decreased levels of biomarkers of exposure.

Patterns of Use: FDA reviewed scientific literature focusing on the general trends and patterns in menthol smoking. Articles reporting data on national estimates or very large representative populations were given highest priority in order to draw estimations of patterns of use that would be applicable and generalizable for the U.S. population overall. Data support that a majority of African American smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, but other minority groups are also more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes as compared to Whites. Further, younger populations have the highest rate of smoking menthol cigarettes, and female smokers are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than male smokers. Also, the use of menthol cigarettes is associated with lower socioeconomic status (SES). From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is associated with particular patterns ofsmokmg.

Marketing and Consumer Perception of risk: FDA reviewed studies of brand preference, advertising receptivity, marketing strategics, and consumer perception of risk in an effort to determine what role, if any, marketing and consumer perception of risk play in the use of menthol cigarettes. Of particular interest was whether there is a stronger relationship between marketing and/or consumer perceptions and the use of menthol among subpopulations (e.g. youth, African Americans, Hispanics, women). The available data show that advertising is a strong driver of brand preference among adolescents and that it is likely that the standard marketing mix approach of price, promotion, product, and place has been used to drive menthol cigarette preference among the urban African American community. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that, like nonmenthol cigarettes, the marketing of menthol cigarettes is associated with brand preference. The marketing of menthol cigarettes is associated with menthol brand preference among adolescents and the African American community. Given the limited data reviewed and mixed results reported, the weight of evidence is not sufficient to support a conclusion that consumer perceptions are associated with the use of menthol cigarettes.

Initiation and Progression to Regular Use: FDA assessed data on the possible impact of menthol cigarettes on initiation and progress to regular use of cigarette smoking with a particular focus on smoking behavior by youth and young adults. Included in the analysis were studies looking at differences in prevalence rates, age of first cigarette, and progression to regular smoking. Data show that newer smokers prefer menthol at levels substantially above that of the general population, with an inverse correlation between age and menthol preference that reaches a plateau in adulthood. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with increased initiation and progression to regular of cigarette smoking.

Dependence: FDA reviewed studies utilizing a variety of measures of nicotine dependence and/or craving. This included studies measuring: time to first cigarette (ITFC), cigarettes per day (end), the FagcrstrGm Test for Nicotine Dependence (FIND), and craving.
pgNbr=700
Night waking to smoke was also included since it is emerging as a reliable indicator of strength of dependence. Data are included on other scales of nicotine dependence and craving if there were direct menthol versus nonmenthol assessments. There were consistent findings that menthol

smokers are more likely to smoke their first cigarette within five minutes of waking. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with increased dependence.

Cessation: FDA analyzed studies addressing questions of whether menthol smokers were differentially successful in smoking cessation. 'Inese included cross-sectional studies, community-based or population-based prospective cohort studies, and clinical trial cessation studies. None of the studies were specifically designed to prospectively evaluate the effect of menthol on cessation. Several of the studies thai failed to find an association between menthol smoking and cessation may have "over-adjusted" their analyses by controlling for the level of dependence. In the reviewed studies, menthol smokers, especially African American menthol smokers, were less likely to successfully stop smoking than their nonmenthol smoking counterparts. This is consistent with the observation that menthol smokers appear to be more nicotine dependent than nonmenthol smokers which can be an important factor in smoking cessation success. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with reduced success in smoking cessation, especially among African American menthol smokers.

Disease Risk: FDA analyzed studies that addressed the impact of smoking menthol cigarettes on disease risk as compared to those risks posed by smoking nonmenthol cigarettes. Studies investigating impact on lung cancer, non-lung smoking-related cancers (esophageal cancer, oropharyngeal cancer), cardiovascular disease, and respiratory outcomes in addition to one study that evaluated health wellness and health conditions such as body mass index (BMI) and emergency room visits were reviewed. No studies found an increased risk of cancer or non-cancer diseases in menthol smokers compared to nonmenthol smokers. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is not associated with an increase in disease risk to the user compared to non-menthol cigarette smokers.

Summary of Evidence

The impact of cigarette smoking upon public health is indisputable. More than 400,000 deaths per year in the United States are caused by tobacco use. Consistent patterns have emerged as a result of FDA's evaluation of the scientific evidence relevant to the impact of menthol tobacco products on public health. While there is little evidence to suggest that menthol cigarettes are more or less toxic or contribute to more disease risk to the user than nonmenthol cigarettes, adequate data suggest that menthol use is likely associated with increased smoking initiation by youth and young adults. Further, the data indicate that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with greater addiction. Menthol smokers show greater signs of nicotine dependence and arc less likely to successfully quit smoking. These findings, combined with the evidence indicating that menthols cooling and anesthetic properties can reduce the harshness of cigarette smoke and the evidence indicating that menthol cigarettes are marketed as a smoother alternative to nonmenthol cigarettes, make it likely that menthol cigarettes pose a public health risk above that seen with nonmenthol cigarettes.

This document is a scientific assessment of public health issues related to the use of menthol in cigarettes. This document does not constitute a decision about what regulatory action, if any, FDA might take with respect to menthol in cigarettes. If FDA determines, after reviewing all of the available information from this assessment and the anticipated public comments, from the fPSAC report and associated public comments, and from the tobacco industry perspective document, that restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of menthol cigarettes or product standards should be established, the Agency would do so pursuant to rulemaking procedures that include public notice and an opportunity for public comment. There is no required deadline or timeline for FDA to make a determination about what regulatory action, if any, is appropriate.

4.    Smoke Chemistry and Nonclinical Toxicology

Scientific studies have investigated the smoke chemistry and nonclinical toxicology of nonmenthol cigarettes, but very few studies have directly compared the exposure of nonmenthol cigarettes to menthol cigarettes. Nonmenthol cigarettes produce an array of harmful chemicals during combustion and result in significant and substantial toxicological effects. Studies that evaluate whether menthol cigarettes produce greater quantities of harmful chemicals or result in more pronounced toxicological outcomes are limited. FDA reviewed scientific papers in order to examine differences in the smoke chemistry and nonclinical toxicology.

Smoke chemistry

The comparison of menthol to nonmenthol cigarettes is of interest to determine if the addition of

menthol impacts the presence or measured levels of and occurrence of harmful smoke

constituents. Schmeltz and Schlot/hauer (1968) evaluated the pyrolysis of menthol and reported

the formation of phenols and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. But their study examined the pyrolysis

of menthol alone and not as part of the process of burning tobacco. So while it is informative, it

must be interpreted with this consideration.                                                                                                            en

In two papers from 2004, Baker et al. reported only minimal differences in harmful smoke                                      �

constituents. They reported their results normalized to the levels of total particulate matter in

smoke which provides relative increases or decreases between constituents, but docs not                                         (0

necessarily reflect overall changes to the amount of harmful smoke constituents delivered per cigarette. They reported an increase in aldehydes in the smoke from the menthol cigarettes, likely due to the comhustion of simple and complex sugars, as well as increased lead. Some constituents were lower compared to the noninenthol cigarette, such as benzo| a]pyrene. From the limited data and differences in how these data can be interpreted, there is a lack of evidence showing that menthol in cigarettes yields substantial changes in smoke chemistry.

Menthol as a singular compound- toxicology, pharmacology and therapeutic applications

A review of the National Toxicology Program (NTP) database (Ashby and Tennant, 199 i) shows that menthol has neither a structural alert for 0NA reactivity or mutagenic activity. Menthol is listed in the database as l^eve] F on their carcinogenicity scale, which indicates that adequate tests have been conducted and the compound is concluded to be non-carcinogenic.

The racemic mixture of menthol was tested in an Ames, sister chromatid exchange and chromosomal aberration assays. In these studies, menthol alone had no effect under the conditions of these assays (Ishidate et a)., 1984; Ivett et al., 1989; and Murthy et al., 1991).

JRabinoff ct al. (2007) reviewed industry documents looking for information on the pharmacological activity of tobacco additives. Possible effects listed for menthol include anesthetic action, complex interaction with nicotine, and increase in P1-N2 amplitudes, an objective electrophysiological measure of bram activity.

Harris (2006) presented a review of the therapeutic applications of menthol alone, based on the interaction al the thermoreceptor. Some therapeutic actions discussed include local anesthesia, nasal decongestant and cough relief.

Antiproliferative effects of menthol a\ a singular compound

There were several papers that examined the effects of menthol on in vitro cell proliferation and have shown that in several cancer cell lines, menthol had a significant growth inhibition effect (Bernhardt et al, 2008; Li et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2006; Lu ct al., 2007; Sidcll ct al., 1991; Tatman and Mo 2002; Yamamura et al., 2008; and Zhang and Barritt 2004).

Ruch and Sigler (1994) examined a mechanism for terpene-induced growth inhibition of rat liver epithelial cells and found that while some tcrpenes (such as Umonene and pinene) appeared to inhibit 3~hydroxy~3-methylglularyl Co A reductase and mevalonic acid synthesis, menthol did not act through this mechanism. It is important to note that any anti-proliferativc effects of menthol have been shown with menthol alone, and not with menthol in combination with tobacco or in a smoke condensate. In fact, as has already been stated, menthol smoke condensate from burned tobacco is genotoxic. Additionally, one should not assume that a compound that had antiproliferative effects in a tumor cell line or even in a transfecled animal model would definitively have oncolytic effects in humans.

In vitro studies have examined the pharmacological activity of menthol to help elucidate the mechanism by which it had antiproliferative effects (Kim et al, 2009; Li et at, 2009; Yamamura et al, 2008; and Zhang and Barritt 2004). These studies all show that menthol acts at the
pgNbr=704
transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) thermoreceptor. Activation of this receptor appears to increase intracellular Ca2+ levels by increasing the influx of extracellular Ca2* through this channel These studies also showed the antiproliferative effects of menthol in tumor ceil lines.

Lu et al. (2006) showed increased Ca2+ levels in human leukemia cells treated with menthol and showed that the decreased cell growth seen could be blocked by the calcium chelator, BAPTA, This is further evidence of the link between the antiproliferative effects of menthol and the increase in intracellular Ca2' that it has been shown to cause cell death.

Sidcll ct al. (1991) also showed menthol down-regulated the IL-6 receptors in a human myeloma cell Ike.

In vitro toxicity of menthol tobacco exjmure

Several reports reviewed here have examined smoke condensate from menthol cigarettes and found no increase in mutagenicity, clastogenjeity or cytotoxicity when compared to a comparable nonmcnthol cigarette. This was done with mainstream and sidestream smoke, with the same results. Some studies also included cigarettes that heat, but do not burn the tobacco as test cigarettes. These heated cigarettes included menthol and nonmcnthol versions. All the cigarettes in which the tobacco was burned were positive in these assays, and cigarettes with added ingredients such as menlhol were not significantly different from the control (Baker et al., 2004; Dootittle et al., 1990a and 1990b; Ivett ct al., 1989; and Roemer et al., 2002).  ITie cigarettes that heat tobacco but do not burn it were negative in these assays with and without menthol added (Doolittlc ct al., 1990a and 1990b;J.eeetal� 1990).

Other in vitro assays showed menthol to be toxic at concentrations greater than 0.1 mM (Bernson and Petlersson 1983). This application produced lesions in biological membranes in the isolated mitochondria assay and increased the permeability over the inner mitochondrial membrane. While interesting, the relevance of these studies to menthol exposure via menthol cigarettes is not strong, as menthol overdose is not likely via this exposure.

In vivo toxicity of menthol tobacco exposure

Several studies reported on in vivo inhalation toxicity studies with test cigarettes that had menthol added as a flavoring ingredient (Baker et a!., 2004; Gaworski et al., 1997). These studies all show no discemable differences in the toxicity of the test cigarettes when compared to the nonmenthol cigarettes.

lr\ vrvo carcinogenesis studies also have shown no significant effects of menthol compared to nonmenthol These studies included the SENCAR mouse skin painting assays with smoke condensate from menthol and nonmenthol cigarettes (Gaworski et al, 1999), DMBA-induced rat mammary carcinogenesis model with menthol in the teed (Russin et al., 1989) and azoxymcthane-induced neoplasia of the large intestine and duodenum with menthol in the feed (Wattenberg.1991).

en B ALB/c mice injected with WEHT-3 leukemia cells also showed effects of menthol exposure,                      co

having slowed leukemia-induced spleen growth,and limited differentiation of the precursors of                    o

macrophages and granulocytes (Lu ct at, 2007).

Industry reviews of menthol

Two tobacco industry reviews (Lorillard (Heck 2010); Altria (Wcrley et al., 2007)) of the available literature on menthol and the possible effects of menthol cigarettes provided no addttionai information and no infomiation that provided new insight into the potential toxicology of exposure to menthol from a menthol cigarette.

Conclusion

While menthol toxicity docs occur, the reviewed studies show that this occurs at liigh levels of menthol as a singular compound and has not been shown with menthol exposure from cigarettes. The nonclinical toxicology data, in vitro or in vivo indicate that menthol exposure from a menthol cigarette does not cause the menthol cigarettes to be substantially more toxic than nonmenthol cigarettes already are. Menthol in smoke condensate is no more genotoxk than condensate from the control cigarettes. Menthol has not been shown to be carcinogenic or to increase the number of tumors or alter the time to rumor emergence from known carcinogens. Fn the few in vivo inhalation studies comparing menthol cigarette smoke to a control cigarette's smoke, researchers found no increased toxicity due to the added menthol. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion thai, from a nonclinical toxicity standpoint menthol in cigarettes is not associated with increased or decreased smoke toxicity.

Menthol is widely used in drug products, foods, cosmetic products, and cigarettes, and generates

a minty taste and a cooling sensation. The flavor and sensation may be pleasing, and can impact

the way a smoker experiences a menthoi cigarette. Menthol's effect on cooling, desensitization,

anesthesia, and the potential effect on nicotine and tobacco specific nitrosamines (TSNAs) using

bom in vitro and m vivo studies in human and animal models can inform how researchers

understand and policy-makers address menthol in cigarettes and its impact on individual                              en

behavior and public health outcomes, as well as effect of menthol on smoking topography. This assessment focuses on the actions of menthol alone rather than tobacco smoke from menthol cigarettes.

Sensory Effects

Green and Schullery (2003) conducted a study that focused primarily on the bitterness stimulation induced by capsaicin and menthol. On average, capsaicin and menthol produced "moderate" bitterness in the edges and side of the tongue and weaker bitterness on the side and tip of the tongue. Sensory irritation from capsaicin was rated significantly higher at the tongue tip, whereas menthol coolness was rated higher in the edges and side of the tongue.

Kuhn et al. (2009) carried out an in vitro study on TRPM8, a cation channel activated by cold and menthol, and found that menthol and raenlhol derivatives were indistinguishable in their ability to evoke currents through channels hi a Ca +-independent manner and by producing Ca - dependent desensitization in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells.

Sherkheli (2008) found that WS-12, a menthol derivative, is more potent and selective than menthol as a TRPM8 agonist in Xcnopus laevis oocytes.

lto et al. (2008) investigated the impact of menthol and icilin on airway smooth muscle contraction in guinea pigs. The study found that as a cold receptor agonist, menthol inhibited contractions elicited by MCh and high K+ concentrations with a reduction in Ca24. Lowering the temperature to room temperature enhanced the relaxing effects of menthol on MCh-induced contractions. The result indicated that stimulation of an unknown cold receptor may be involved in the relaxation mediated by menthol in guinea pig tracheal smooth muscle.

Menthol gives a sense of cooling. Campero et al (2009) used microneurography to search for C fibers (a type of sensory cell) in human skin that are activated by cooling and menthol. Menthol activated only Type 2 C fibers, which showed a strong reaction to harmless cooling and were strongly activated and sensitized to cooling by menthol.

Orani et al. (1991) found in guinea pigs that cooling of the larynx and application of l-mcnthol to the laryngeal lumen reduced ventilation. Application of menthol to the nasal cavity markedly enhanced the ventilatory inhibition. Although 1-menthol did not actually reduce laryngeal temperature, the laryngeal lumen responded as though it did. In fact, 1-menthol seems to be more effective in reducing ventilation than physical cooling.

Sant'Ambrogio et al. (1991,1992) investigated the effect of 1-menthol on laryngeal and upper airway cold receptors in dogs. The study found that 1-menthol acted as a specific stimulant of laryngeal cold receptors. Trials with cold air and warm air plus 1-menthol exposure on upper airway cold receptors greatly reduced ventilation in newborn dogs. The menthol-induced respiratory depression occured even earlier than the cold-induced effect. The faster onset of reflex response could be because the menthol stimulation of cold receptors was greater or because nasal cold receptors were involved in the menthol response.
pgNbr=718
By monitoring the action potentials of the ethmoidal nerve, Sekizawa (1996) characterized the responsiveness of nasal cold receptors to menthol and capsaicin in guinea pigs. Both cold air and l-menthol stimulated the ethmoidal afferent activity. Topical anesthesia of the nasal cavity with 2 percent Hdocaine eliminated these responses. This study dovetails with those discussed earlier; it provides electrophysiological support for the breathing inhibition that other studies also found (OranietaL, 1991; Sant'Ambrogioctal., 1991; Sant' Ambrogio et ai., 1992).

Mechanisms of Menthol Action

in an in vivo human study, Dessirier et al. (2001) assessed the responses of participants' tongues to menthol application. Repeated application of menthol produced desensitization as characterized by a progressive reduction in the ratings of the intensity of irritation across trials. This appeared to generalize, as menthol exposure also significantly weakened nicotine-evoked irritation. The desensitization and cross-desensitization was temporary, with a return to normal sensations after a rest period.

Cold temperatures and some chemical stimuli (like menthol) activate the TRPM8 receptor. Kuhn ct al. (2009) fouud that prolonged menthol exposure desensitized TRPM8 receptors. Galeolti et al. (2002) found that menthol could induce analgesia in mice, regardless of the noxious stimulus used: thermal (hot-plate) or chemical (abdominal constriction test). The analgesic properties were mediated through a selective activation of K-opioid receptors.

An in vivo study demonstrated that menthol is an effective cough suppressant in chemically induced coughing in conscious guinea pigs (Laude et ai, 1994).

Sekizawa et al. (1996) found that topical anesthesia of the nasal cavity eliminated the responsiveness of nasal cold receptors to cold air and l-menthol in guinea pigs. The desensitization and analgesic effect of menthol may reduce sensitivity of human response to irritation induced by smoking constituents.

Wright et al, (1997) found that menthol exposure promotes bronchodilatationboth in vitro and in vivo in guinea pigs. The authors also proposed that menthol might act as an antagonist of calcium (Ca2+) channels.

Sidcll et al. (1990) demonstrated that exposure to menthol could block the depoJarization-induccd Ca2* influx though both dihydropyridinc (DIIP)~sensitive and DHP-insensitive Ca2+ channels in LA-N-5 human neuroblastoma cells. Whether menthol blocks Ca2+ channels was concentration-dependent, rapid in onset, and readily reversible. In addition, applying rnentholto neuroblastoma cells in culture resulted in morphologic differentiation and inhibition of cell growth that correlated with menthol's ability to block the dmydropyridme-msensitive Ca2+ current

Lin et al. (2005) found menthol to have potential antitumor qualities. Menthol inhibited the growth of cancer cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Menthol inhibited topoisomerase 1, Ua and lip, but promoted the levels of NF-kB gene expression. These data suggest that menthol may induce cytotoxicity through inhibiting gene expression of topoisomerase I, ITa and ITp and promoting the gene expression of NF-kB in SNU-5 cells.
pgNbr=719
Metabolic Effects

MacDougall et al. (2003) found that menthol and synthetic congeners inhibited the microsomal oxidation of nicotine to cotinine (the primary metabolite of nicotine) in human liver microsomal testing systems. The data suggested that smoking menthol cigarettes may lead to inhibition of nicotine metabolism and allow the smoker to achieve prolonged exposure to nicotine.

Azzi et al. (2006) found menthol donor solution (0.08%) decreased the flux of 4-(methylnitrosamino)-J -(3-pyridyl)-l-biitanone (NNK) and significantly increased the tissue reservoir formation in porcine esophageal mucosa. The magnitude of the reservoir formed was similar for control and menthol, but was significantly liigher in the presence of both ethanol and menthol.

Squier et aJ. (2010) found that the presence of menthol significantly increased the uptake of both Nr~nitrosonornicotme(NNN) and nicotine over that of controls with no menthol in porcine buccal and floor of mouth mucosa. According to the authors, the presence of menthol might increase exposure of carcinogens and nicotine, which in turn might increase the risk of cancer and dependence, however there are no disease outcome data that support this hypothesis.

In a crossover study with 14 subjects, Bcnowitz et al. (2004) found that mentholation of cigarettes did not affect systemic intake of nicotine and carbon monoxide. Researchers reported that menthol smoking inhibits the metabolism of nicotine through slower oxidative metabolism to cotinine and slower glucuronidc conjugation.

Effects of Menthol on Smoking To/wgraphy

Ahijevych & Parsley (1999) assessed smoking topography in a clinical research setting using a two-factor study design involving 95 women, half of whom smoked menthol cigarettes. Menthol smokers (n=49) had significantly larger puff volumes compared to nonmenthol smokers (n=46). larger puff volumes can result in smokers' exposure to more chemicals.

Pickworth et al. (2002) found that mentholation of cigarettes had no effect on topography, with menthol smokers (n=l8) and nonmenthol smokers (n=!8) each taking approximately 8 puffs per commercial cigarette, and approximately 11 puffs per high nicotine yield cigarette and per low nicotine yield cigarette.

Using a two-factor factorial design and a sample of 37 women divided by menthol or nonmcnthol cigarette use, Ahijevych ct al. (1996) found nonmenthol smokers had a trend toward higher puff volumes as compared to menthol smokers (mean - 48.5 vs. 42.7 ml), however this did not reach signficance.

Jarvik ct al. (1994) measured smoking topography in 20 smokers (10 were menthol smokers) and found menthol cigarettes decreased the average and total cumulative puff volumes and increased
pgNbr=720
the mean puff flow rates of inhaled smoke. Researchers noted no significant differences in the depth of inhalation of the smoke or in the amount of insoluble smoke particulates delivered to or retained in the respiratory tract between the two types of cigarettes.

McCarthy et al. (1995) studied 29 male smokers who smoked either a regular or a menthol cigarette in two separate sessions one week apart. Researchers used commercial brands with comparable tar, nicotine, and CO content. When smoking the nonmenthol cigarettes, participants took 22 percent more puffs and had 13 percent higher mean volumes per puff than they did when smoking the menthol cigarettes.

The tobacco industry is aware that menthol has cooling, anaesthetic, and analgesic properties that moderate the harshness and irritation of tobacco. Yerger and McCandless (2011) reviewed publicly available tobacco industry documents and concluded that the documents suggest the amount of menthol in a cigarette is associated with how the cigarette is smoked and how satisfying it is to the smoker. According to these documents, menthol's physiological effects contribute to the sensory qualities of the smoke and affect smoking topography.

Industry Assessment of Menthol Effects

Heck (2009) found median blood carboxyhemoglobin values, total urinary 4-(methyInitrosamino)-l-(3-pyridyl)-l-butanof (NNAL), and urinary nicotine equivalents were not significantly different between the menthol and nonmenthol smokers.

Wang et al. (2010) found smoking menthol cigarettes does not increase daily exposure to smoke constituents as measured by nicotine equivalents (total and per cigarette), serum colinine, and COHb after adjusting for cpd and the smoking behavior characteristics of the participants.

In its presentation to TPSAC, Altria Client Services presented analysis of the Total Exposure

Study (TES) that also showed no differences between users of menthol and nonmenthol brands for a wide

variety of biomarkers of exposure, biomarkers of potential harm, nicotine metabolite ratios, measures of

smoker topography, and nicotine dependence, alter adjustment for cpd and smoking behavior

characteristics.

Conclusion

Menthol generates a minty taste and a cooling sensation. At lower concentrations menthol has a soothing effect, while it is irritating at high concentrations. Smokers experience the cooling sensation of menthol in cigarettes, and menthol is perceived as reducing the irritation and harshness of smoking. Severn I in vitro and in vivo studies investigated the sensory effects of menthol and discussed mechanisms for these effects. In addition, a few studies suggested that menthol might have a role on exposure and metabolism of nicotine and TSNAs. Due primarily to menthol's sensory effects, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes in likely associated with altered physiological responses to tobacco smoke.

While highly potent inhibitton of P4502A6 was not observed for the menthol analogues examined, it is nevertheless possible that smoking mentholated cigarettes leads to Inhibition of nicotine metabolism and allows the smoker to achieve a certain elevated dose of nicotine each day.

Whatever the mechanism by which menthol facilitates absorption of carbon monoxide (and probably nicotine), the studys repeated-measures data suggest that inferences about the genetic basis for observed racial differences in blood cotinine levels may be premature, and conjectures about the effects of menthol in cigarettes on smoking behavior may need to be modified.

Both cooling of the larynx and E-menthol in the laryngeal lumen reduce ventilation Exposure of the nasal cavity to l-menthol markedly enhances this ventilatory inhibition; considering the stimulatory effect of l-rnenthcl on cold receptors, these results suggest a predominant role of nasal cold receptors in this response.

L-menthol constitutes a specific stimulant of laryngeal cold receptors and cculd provide a useful tool for the study of their reflex effects.

However, a residual depressive effect of/-menthol was still present in 3 of 5 animals and was abolished by nasal anesthesia, suggesting the involvement of nasal cold receptors.

C.    Biomarkers

Biomarkers of exposure are used to objectively measure and evaluate levels of exposure to particular chemicals. Biomarkers that are used to evaluate smoke exposure include particular smoke constituents and/or their metabolites in biological specimens (e.g., exhaled air, saliva, blood, urine). Specifically, biomarkers assessed here include expired carbon monoxide (CO) and blood carboxyhemogJobin (COHb) for levels of CO exposure, cotinine and other nicotine equivalents in serum and urine for exposure to nicotme, and total NNAL in urine for exposure to TSNAs. Very limited data are available for other biomarkers of exposure and biomarkers of potential harm.

Biomarkers of exposure to CO
pgNbr=732
Miller ct al. (1994) measured the exhaled CO levels in male smokers (n = 12) who participated in three controlled-dosc smoking sessions spaced one week apart. Exhaled CO levels increased along with menthol external dose. The authors proposed that these results suggested thai menthol cigarette preference may account for some of the racial differences in smoking behavior and smoking-related outcomes.

In a cross-sectional study, Clark et al. (1996) found that, compared with White smokers (n^=96), African American smokers (n=65) had significantly higher breath CO levels per cigarette smoked and per millimeter of the smoked tobacco rod after adjusting for race, cpd, and mean amount of each cigarette smoked,

Williams et al. (2007) examined expired CO for 89 smokers with schizophrenia and 53 control smokers two minutes after smoking an afternoon cigarette. Expired CO was higher in menthol compared with nonmenthol smokers, controlling for group, cpd, and race. The higher exhaled CO in menthol smokers suggests an increased intake of smoke from menthol cigarettes.

One study found menthol cigarettes were associated with decreased breath CO. Ahijevych ct al. (1996) conducted a two-factor factorial trial whh a sample of 37 women stratified by race and menthol or nonmenthol cigarette use. For CO boost, there was a significant main effect for race (African Americans > Whites) and a main effect for menthol or nonmenthol use (nonmenthol > menthol).

Benowifz ct al. (2004) found that mentholation of cigarettes did not affect systemic intake of nicotine and CO in a crossover study with 14 smokers.

Biomarkers of exposure to nicotine

Tn a small, experimental study with 32 women, Ahijcvych ct al. (2002) examined the effect of selected factors of ethnicity, menthol cigarette preference, body composition and alcohol-use history on cotinine half-life. Being an African American menthol smoker, fewer years of alcohol use, and greater lean body mass explained 52,0 percent of the variance in cotinine half-life and was associated with a longer half-life. Among menthol smokers, baseline cotinine level and cotinine half-life were not significantly different between White and African American women,

Clark et al, (1996) found that, compared with White smokers (n=96), African American smokers (nH>5) had sipificantly higher serum cotinine levels per cigarette smoked and per millimeter of smoked tobacco rod after adjusting for race, cpd, and mean amount of each cigarette smoked.

Using a sample of 359 participants, Mustonen et al. (2005) observed a positive correlation between cotinine and CO in all smokers and a correlation between cotinine and cpd in
pgNbr=733
nonmenthol smokers. Among menthol smokers, cotininc and cpd correlations varied by gender and race. Results showed trends to higher cotininc levels in menthol smokers, although the differences were not statistically significant. The cotinincxpd ratio was significantly higher among menthol smokers compared to nonmenthol smokers (p=0.004). A significant gender by race by menthol interaction existed on salivary cotiniue level as well as cotinincxpd ratio,

Williams ct al. (2007) examined serum nicotine and cotininc tor 89 smokers with schizophrenia and S3 control smokers two minutes after smoking an afternoon cigarette. Semm nicotine and cotinine levels were higher in smokers of menthol compared with nonmenthol cigarettes. Iliere were no differences in 3-hydroxyeolinine:cotinine ratios between groups when controlling for race. Further linear regression models showed that smoking menthol cigarettes was a significant predictor of nicotine and cotinine levels. The higher exhaled CO in menthol smokers described above suggests that the higher nicotine levels arc at least partially related to increased smoke lntuKc Jtrom mcntnoi cigarettes, i ncse autnors suggested tnat meninoi mignt oc associated witn increased health risks of smoking.

In a crossover study of 14 participants, Benowitz et al. (2004) found that mentholation of cigarettes did not affect systemic intake of nicotine. However, menthol cigarette smoking inhibited the metabolism of nicotine by slower oxidative metabolism to cotininc and by slower glucuronide conjugation.

White and African American Smokers

Perez-Stable et al. (1998) found higher levels of cotininc per cigarette smoked by African Americans (n^O) compared with Whites (n=39). Both slower clearance of cotininc and higher intake of nicotine per cigarette in African Americans explain this result.

Carabatloet al. (1998) provided evidence from a large national study (n~7182)that African American smokers have higher serum cotininc levels than do White or Mexican American smokers, after adjustment for cpd, age, sex, body weight, number of smokers living in the home, and number of hours exposed at work to environmental tobacco smoke.

Using data from smokers in the the CARDIA longitudinal cohort study (n=T424), Wagenknecht et al. (1990) found signficantly higher serum cotininc levels in African American smokers as compared to White smokers. Tins difference remained significant after adjusting for cpd, nicotine content of the cigarette, years of smoking, inhalation frequency, and demographic factors. This difference was not explained by reporting bias or nicotine intake differences. The study suggested that the differences in scrum cotinine levels may be due to innate differences between the races in the metabolism or excretion of nicotine or cotininc.

In a study of 91 adolescents seeking cessation treatment, Moolchan et al. (2006) found that African Americans (n=30) smoked significantly fewer cpd and had lower nicotine metabolite ratios when compared to White smokers (n=61). Consistent with metabolic variation, mean plasma cotininexpd ratio was significantly higher in African American compared to White adolescents. Results remained statistically significant when comparing menthol smokers by ethnicity. The data suggested that observed differences arc due to factors other than menthol smoking and suggest that accounting for racial or ethnic differences is crucial for interpreting group differences.

Menthol and Nonmenthoi Smokers

Using data from 1999-2002 NHANRS (n=l 520), Gan et al. (2008) found that scrum colinine levels were significantly higher in menthol smokers compared with nonmenthoi smokers using a univariate model but not significantly higher using a multivariate model adjusted for gender, cpd, age, race, BMJ, poverty status, Federal Trade Commission test nicotine content in each cigarette, and menthol or nonmenthoi use.

In a sample of 37 white and African American women, Ahijevych ct al. (1996) found no significant differences in nicotine boost by race and/or menthol or nonmenthoi use.

In a community-based cross-sectional study (n=525), Muscat et al. (2009) found no significant differences in measures of smoking exposure (metabolites of nicotine or NNAL) by menthol status in either white or African American smokers.

Patterson et al. (2003) investigated the demographic, smoking status, and psychological predictors of nicotine boost in a clinical trial with 190 treatment-seeking smokers. Boost was assessed by comparing plasma nicotine levels before and after participants smoked one of their own brand of cigarettes as desired. Menthol or nonmenthoi brand was not associated with the nicotine boost.

Using samples of 255 current smokers from the Southern Community Cohort Study participants, Signorcllo et al. (2009) found higher serum cotinine levels in African American compared with White smokers, particularly for women, and observed no increase in scrum cotinine levels associated with menthol cigarette use after adjusting for age, race, sex, and cpd. The authors concluded that the differences in serum cotinine levels among smokers might be due to racial variation in exposure to and/or metabolism of tobacco smoke constituents.

Biomarkers of exposure to TSNAs

In a community-based cross-sectional study, Muscat et al. (2009) found no significant differences in measures of smoking exposure (metabolites of nicotine or NNAL). The NN AL-glucuronide(Gluc):NNAL ratio between smokers of menthol (n=67) and nonmenthoi (if=80) cigarettes was 34 percent lower in Whites (P < 0.01) and 22 percent lower in African Americans; the difference in African Americans was not statistically significant.

In a study of 109 current smokers, Slrasscr et al. (2011) found faster nicotine metabolizers had greater total puff volume and total NNAL. Groups with more nonmenthoi smokers (quartiles three and four) appeared to have higher mean NNAL than groups with fewer nonmenthoi smokers (quartiles one and two) although the difference was not statistically significant.

Richie et al. (1997) found that urinary NNAL~Gluc:NNAL ratios, a likely indicator of NNAL glucuronidatiou and detoxification, were significantly greater in Whites (n=27) than in African Americans (n=34). The absolute levels of urinary NNAL, NNAL-Gluc, and cotinine were also greater in African Americans than in Whites when adjusted for the cpd. Dissimilarities in exposure or other sociodemographicor dietary factors did not explain observed racial

Ol CD CD O
pgNbr=735
differences. Also, it is unlikely that the dissimilarities are due to racial differences in preference for menthol cigarettes, because chronic administration of menthol to NNK-treated rats did not result in either increases in urinary total NNAL or decreases in NNAL-Glue:NNAL ratios. Altogether, these results suggest that racial differences in NNAL glucuronidation may explain in part the observed racial differences in lung cancer risk.

Additional Evidence Eased on Altria Total Exposure Study

FDA analyzed additional data from the Altria TES using unadjusted and adjusted regression models, which were collected from over 5,000 participants. The variables in the adjusted model consisted of gender, race, education, income, Hispanic ethnicity, BMT, number of years and cigarettes smoked, tar delivery category, and total puff volume. Biomarkers of exposure include urine level measures of total nicotine equivalents, total NNAL, total 1 -hydroxypyrene (1-OHP), total 3-hydroxypropyl mercapturic acid (3-HPMA), total raonohydroxy-3-butenyl mercapturic acids (MIIBMA), total 1,2-dihydroxybutyl mercapturic acid (I)HBMA), and serum level measurements of cotintne, carboxyhemoglobin, and red blood cell 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP) hemoglobin (lib) adducts. All biomarkers obtained from urine measurements were analyzed as cigarette-adjusted and crcatinine-adjusted measures as well as totals. The analysis found no statistically significant differences between menthol and nonmenthol smokers in any biomarkers of exposure in the adjusted model. The observed statistically significant differences in biomarkers of exposure (unadjusted data) between menthol and nonmenthol smokers may be due to differences in demographic or smoking behavior characteristics between menthol and nonmenthol smokers. In both the total and crcatinine-adjusted measures, menthol smokers showed significantly lower levels of exposure to nicotine equivalents (p<0.0001 and p=0.0002, respectively), NNAL (p<0.0001 and p-0.0002), 3-HPMA (p<0.0001 and pO.OOOl), MIIBMA (p<0,0001 and p<0.0001), and DHBMA (p<0.0001 and p<0.0001) in the unadjusted model. However, no per cigarette measure for these outcomes showed any statistically significant differences between menthol and nonmenthol smokers. Menthol smokers showed significantly higher levels of 1-OHP exposure per cigarette than nonmenthol smokers (p=0.0002) in the unadjusted model. However, no significant differences in exposure to 1-OHP per cigarette between menthol and nonmenthol smoker were observed in the adjusted model. The unadjusted 3-hydroxycotininc:cotinine ratio was significantly higher (indicating more rapid detoxification) in menthol smokers (p<0.000l). However, the significance of this difference did not persist after adjusting for demographic and smoking behavior variables, Neither the nicotinexotinine ratio in the adjusted or unadjusted model showed any significant differences between menthol and nonmenthol smokers. The likely explanation for this result lies with differences between African American and other racial groups' cotinine levels.

Tn the TES, biomarkers of potential harm included urine level measures for 8-epi prostaglandin-F2a and 1 l-dehydrothromboxane-B2 and serum level measures of total bilirubin, white blood cells, C-reactivc protein, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor antigen, total, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and oxidized LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEVI), and forced expiratory vital capacity (FVC). Urine measurements were analyzed as crcatinine-adjusted measures as well as totals. In the unadjusted model, menthol smokers showed significantly Sower levels of total cholesterol (p=0.0002), LDL cholesterol (p=0.0053), and triglycerides (p<0.0001), and higher levels of HDL cholesterol (p=0.0016). However, these differences were no longer significant after adjustment for demographic and smoking behavior variables. Menthol smokers also showed
pgNbr=736
significantly lower unadjusted levels of 8-epj prostaglandin^ (p=0.0491), white blood cells (p=0.0002), and total bilirubin (p=0,0012), but higher levels of the van Wiltcbrand antigen factor (pK).0172). The only difference between menthol and nonmenthol smokers that remained statistically significant in the adjusted model was for 8-epi prostaglandin^ (p=0.0318). However, the effect of menthol on 8-epi prostaglandin-!^ reversed direction after adjustment for demographic characteristics and smoking behavior, with menthol smokers showing significantly higher levels of 8-epi prostaglandin of about 99 ng per 24 hour period higher for menthol smokers.

FDA also analyzed demographic, smoking, and biomarker levels for over 5000 smokers participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999-2008, Researchers used linear regression, controlling for demographic, health, and smoking characteristics to analyze the associations between menthol cigarette use and biomarker levels. Menthol cigarette use was not associated with higher scram cotinine levels on a per cigarette basis. There was no statistically significant difference for NNAL levels for menthol smokers compared to nonmenthol smokers, although additional data are needed to more precisely estimate any association foT this biomarker.

Menthol secondary data analysis (through RT1 subcontracts) of the Hcrscy study examined the relationship in youth (n= 5,511) between smoking menthol cigarettes, salivary cotinine levels, and nicotine dependence. Controlling for age, sex, race or ethnicity, and the length, frequency, and level of smoking, descriptive and regression analysis found that menthol versus nonmenthol cigarette use was not significantly associated with salivary cotinine level models that included cpd smoked. Among youth who smoked for less than one year, a significant interaction exists between menthol use and the number of cigarettes smoked per day � menthol cigarette use was associated with increased salivary cotinine levels among heavier smokers. Findings were similar for Whites and non-Whites,

Industry Assessment of Menthol Effects

Not all studies support the hypothesis that menthol cigarette smoking results in a greater absorption of tobacco smoke chemicals, Tn an industry-sponsored study, Heck (2009) found median blood carboxyhemoglobin values, total urinary 4-(methyInitrosamino)-l-(3-pyridyl)-l-butanol (NNAL), and urinary nicotine equivalents were not significantly different between the menthol and nonmenthol cigarette smokers. In an industry-sponsored study, Wang et al. (2010) found smoking menthol cigarettes docs not increase daily exposure to smoke constituents as measured by nicotine equivalents (total and per cigarette), serum cotinine and COHb after adjusting for the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the smoking behavior characteristics of the participants. In its presentation to TPSAC, Altiia Client Services presented analysis of the TES that also showed no differences between users of menthol and nonmenthol brands in the TBS for a wide variety of biomarkers of exposure, biomarkers of potential harm, nicotine metabolite ratios, and measures of smoker topography and nicotine dependence after adjustment for the number of cigarettes per day and smoking behavior characteristics.

Conclusion

Although a few small studies have found that smoking menthol cigarettes may modulate exposure or metabolism of CO, nicotine, and/or TSNAs, several large, wcll-dcsigncd studies failed to find
pgNbr=737
statistically significant differences in biomarkers between smoking menthol or nonmenlhoi cigarettes. Considering all available studies, but with more emphasis given to the findings of the large, well-controlled studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely not associated with increased or decreased levels of biomarkers of exposure.

Higher levels of cotinine per cigarette smoked by blacks compared with whites can be explained by both slower clearance of cotinine and higher intake of nicotine per cigarette in blacks. Greater nicotine and therefore greater tobacco smoke intake per cigarette could, in part, explain some of the ethnic differences In smoking-related disease risks.

The proportion of blacks falling into the former, potentially high-risk group was significantly greater than thai of whites (P < 0.05). The absolute levels of urinary NMAL, NNAL-Gluc, and cotinine were also greater in blacks than in whites when adjusted for the number of cigarettes smoked. None of the observed racial differences coufd be explained by dissimilarities in exposure or other sododemographic or dietary factors.

Analyses of variance revealed no statistically significant effects o1 mentholated cigarettes on NE/24 h, COHb, serum cotinine and NE/cigarette. On average MS smoked 15 0 and NMS 16.8 cigarettes/day. The unadjusted mean differences were as follows: MS had lower NE/24 h (5.4%) and COHb (3.2%), higher serum cotinine (3.0%) and NE/cigarette (5.7%) than NMS. African-Americans MS smoked 40% fewer cigarettes, showed

lower NE/24 h (24%) and COHb (10%) and higher NE/cig (29%) and serum cotinine (8%) levels than their White counterparts. Conclusions: Smoking mentholated cigarettes does not increase daily exposure to smoke constituents as measured by NE and COHb. These findings are consistent with the majority of epidemiological studies indicating no difference in smoking related risks between MS and NMS.

D.    Patterns of Use

Approximately one-fourth of all cigarettes sold in the United States are menthol (Giovmo, 2004). An understanding of menthol cigarette usage patterns can guide health providers, public health professionals, and policy makers to develop effective strategies to reduce smoking prevalence and smoking-attrtbulable morbidity and mortality. Nationwide, there are significant disparities among cigarette use, with higher prevalence among certain racial/ethnic groups and among those of lower socioeconomic status (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2012). Similarly, there arc different demographic distribution and characteristics of menthol and nonrnenthol smokers. Understanding these patterns of use and relationships are critical to addressing the public health needs of these groups. This section evaluated studies of national survey data examining the patterns of use of menthol cigarettes as compared to nonrnenthol cigarettes.

Tobacco Use Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS-TUS)

The CPS-TUS had a nationally representative sample of respondents and a high response rate with comprehensive demographic data collection. The survey also assumed no switching between cigarette types during subjects' lifetimes, which could also lead to misclassification.The use of mixed interview procedures (most by telephone and some by personal interview) may have affected responses, which may or may not be substantial, l*roxy respondents were included which may have affected the reliability of data, particularly on menthol cigarette use. In addition, a relatively small number of minority population subjects (i.e., Asian American/Pacific Tslanders and American Indian/Alaska Natives) could limit the ability to provide meaningful estimates of these minority groups.

Alexander et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2006/2007 CPS-TUS on 30,176 current smokers who were al least 18 years old to examine the relationships among occupational status, menthol smoking preference and employer-sponsored smoking cessation programs and policies on quitting behaviors. The authors of the study found that menthol smokers were more likely to be females compared with nonrnenthol smokers (55.1% vs. 43.4%), The authors also found that menthol smokers were more likely to be African American (30.2% vs. 4.4%), less educated (Le., less than high school) (20.2% vs. 17.9%), never married (35.5% vs. 28.4%), residing in the northeast region (21.1% vs. 15.4%), and service employees (23.2% vs. 18.4%) compared with nonrnenthol smokers.

Fagan et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS on 46,273

daily current smokm who were at least 18 years old survey to examine the associations

between usual cigarette type (i.e., menthol or nonrnenthol) and markers for nicotine

dependence and also between cigarette type and quitting behaviors. The study found

differences in demographics between menthol and nonrnenthol daily current smokers.

Menthol smokers were more likely to be females (58.0% vs. 47,3%), younger adults (age

18 to 30 years) (27.4% vs. 24.2%), African American (26.9% vs. 3.5%), never married                             en

(32.9% vs. 25.3%), less educated (less than high school diploma or GKD) (17.1% vs.                                -sj

14.5%), and have an annual income of less than $ 10,000 (13.0% vs. 9.6%) compared to                             �
pgNbr=748
nonmenthol smokers. Among menthol smokers, there were also more rcspondenls who were administrative and office workers, worked in service sectors, unemployed, living in northeastern and midweslern regions, and residing in metropolitan areas compared with nonmenthol smokers. The study also found that menthol smokers reported smoking a mean of 13 cpd compared with 15 cpd among nonmenthol smokers (p < 0,001).

Fernander et al (2010) analyzed data on 66,145 current smokers from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS who were at least 18 years old to examine the relationship between age of cigarette smoking initiation and cigarette purchasing patterns of menthol cigarettes among current smokers. The study found that 24.6 percent of current smokers reported using menthol cigarettes, whereas 70,9 percent reported using nonmenthol cigarettes. The study also found that menthol smokers were more likely to be female (54.8% vs 43.7%), African American (28.7% vs. 3.9%), younger (he., 18-24 years old: 17,3% vs. 14.1%), and less educated compared with nonmenthol smokers.

Trinidad et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS involving 283,443 respondents 20-65 years old at the time of the survey. The study showed that a much larger proportion of African American current smokers reported usually smoking menthol cigarettes (69.8% + 1.6%) compared to other racial groups (20.1% for White; 25.4% for Hispanic/latino smokers).

Lawrence et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS and presented results of data on 69,193 smokers 18 years old or over. They found that, overall, 27.6 percent of current smokers smoked menthoJ cigarettes. Of African American current smokers, 73.6 percent smoked menthol cigarettes followed by 27.9 percent of Hispanic, 26,2 percent of Asian American/Pacific Islander, 22.5 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native, and 21.1 percent of White current smokers. The prevalence of smoking menthol cigarettes was highest in the following sociodemographic categories (in order of proportion); African American, born in a US territory, unemployed, annual family income of less than $10,000, residence in the Northeast, never married, consumption of less than 10 cpd, education level of 9-11 years, 18-24 years old, female, smoking on some days, start of regular smoking after age 18, residence in a metropolitan area, and no use of other forms of tobacco. African American smokers were 10-11 times more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than White smokers were. Most non-White smokers, with the exception of American Indian/Alaska Natives, and women were also more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than White smokers and male smokers. African American smokers 18-24 years old were four times more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes compared with African American smokers 65 years old or over.

National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS)

The NYTS had a nationally representative sample from public and private schools with a

response rate of 80 percent and oversampled African American, Hispanic, and Asian American

students. The survey included two types of data on menthol cigarette use - exclusive brand

(Newport or Kool) and self-reported menthol cigarette use. However, the sample size was

smaller due to restrictions on the study population, with assumptions made regarding no

switching between cigarette brands. Smoking status was based ou self-report, Gencralizability                  tn

may be limited since study subjects were students enrolled in regular public and private schools;                ^

students in non-traditional schools, such as schools for special education, were excluded from                   o
pgNbr=749
the study. Furthermore, there were insufficient numbers of Asian Americans and Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders (H/PT). The data reflect smoking status in the past 30 days (which is typical for smoking surveys) and did not have information on temporal effects or switching patterns. The response rates were reasonable (84% in 2000 and 75% in 2002), with assessment of the possible misclassification by comparing respondents' reports of menthol use.

Applcyard et al. (2001) analyzed data from the 2000 NYTS of 35,828 middle and high school students in public and private schools across the country to estimate the prevalence of cigarette smoking and describe smoking behaviors among H/PI youdi. This study found among those who reported smoking in the past 30 days, 42 percent reported that they smoked menthol cigarettes. While 74 percent of African American youth said their usuaJ brand of cigarette was a menthol brand, 58 percent of Asian Americans, 51 percent of Hispanics, 46 percent of IT/PI, and 32 percent of Whites indicated the same. This study is one of only a few studies that focused on Asian American and H/PI youth.

Wackowski et al. (2007) conducted a cross-sectional study to examine the rates of menthol smoking and measures of nicotine dependence using data on 1,345 current established smokers in grade 9�12 who participated in the 2004 NYTS, This study found that approximately 46 percent of all current established cigarette smokers (e.g., those who smoked in the past 30 days and smoked at least 100 cigarettes during their lifetime) were menthol smokers. Overall, 21.7 percent of 9 -12 grade students were current cigarette smokers and 13.8 percent were current established cigarette smokers. Prevalence of smoking significantly increased by grade among both current and cuiTcnt established smokers and differed by race or ethnicity, with prevalence being highest among White students. Approximately 24 percent of current established smokers indicated smoking a menthol exclusive brand (a brand that is only available in menthol, such as Newport (until 2010) or Kool) and 44 percent reported that they usually smoked menthol cigarettes. Of African American smokers, 88.4 percent reported that they regularly smoked menthol cigarettes, as compared to 54.2 percent Hispanic smokers, 49.7 percent of Asian American smokers, and 43.8 percent of White smokers who reported regularly smoking menthol cigarettes.

Herscy et al. (2006) analyzed data from the 2000 and 2002 N YTS on students in grades

6-12 in public and private schools at the time of the survey who reported to be current

smokers (smoking cigarettes on one or more of the past 30 days) and who reported that

they had a usual brand of cigarettes. This study reported that between 2000 and 2002, the

percentage of smokers who regularly smoked menthol cigarettes increased significantly

(p<0.05) from 40.0 percent to 47.4 percent - an increase of 18.5 percent. Menthol

cigarette use significantly increased among middle school smokers (from 51.6% to

59.6%, p<0.05). Menthol cigarettes were most popular among younger and newer

smokers. Overall, 51.8 percent of teens who had smoked tor less than one year smoked

menthol cigarettes, compared with 43.6 percent of those who had smoked for a year or

more. For Hispanic and White youth, the prevalence of menthol cigarette use was higher

among middle school students than among high school students. Among Hispanic youth,

62.9 percent of smokers in middle school, compared with 52.4 percent of smokers in high

school, smoked menthol cigarettes. Among Whites, 53.1 percent of smokers in middle

school, compared with 37,4 percent of smokers in high school, smoked menthol                                         ^

cigarettes. Among African American students, smokers in middle school (87.5%) and in                            Jj

high school (86.8%) smoked predominantly menthol cigarettes.                                                                 o
pgNbr=750
Hersey et aL (2010) analyzed data from the 2006 NYTS to examine the reliability of youth self-reported menthol cigarette use. They analyzed data from 4,738 students in grades 6-12 in the spring of 2006 who reported that they had smoked in the past 30 days, had a usual brand of cigarette, and could identify whether the usual brand was menthol or nonmenthol. The study found that among youth smokers who reported a usual brand, 51.7 percent of middle school smokers and 43.1 percent of high school smokers consistently reported that their usual brand was menthol. The proportion of middle school smokers whose usual brand was menthol was higher among those who smoked for one year or more (54.7%) than among those who smoked for less than a year (42.2%). Among high school youth, these percentages were similar for smokers who had smoked for less than and for more than one year (42.8% vs. 43.1%). This study also found that menthol cigarette use was very high among minority youth- 80.6 percent of African American middle school smokers and 84.8 percent of African American high school smokers reported that their usual brand was menthol. Among Asian Americans, a mentliol brand was used by 57.4 percent of middle school smokers and 43.6 percent of high school smokers. Among Hispanics, 57.9 percent of middle school smokers and 56.4 percent of high school smokers reported that they smoked menthol cigarettes. In non-Hispanic Whites, the proportion of menthol smokers was higher among middle school students (43.1%) than among high school students (37.6%). Misclassification of menthol or nonmcnthol cigarette use was up to 12 percent among new smokers (i.e., smoked < 6 cigarettes over lifetime; about 19 percent of smokers) compared to 2 percent among established smokers (who had smoked for at least 12 months).

National Health Interview Survey   Cancer Control Supplement (NHIS - CCS)

The NHIS-CCS had a nationally representative sample with information on smoking habits. The relatively small sample size limited subgroup analysis, and data may not have been representative of the population under 25 years old and over 64 years old due to the selection of the study population. There was also a potential for misclassification, as former smokers were defined as not currently smoking, which could have classified those who quit as recently as one week before as former smokers. There was also no description of how the predicted prevalence was calculated or what imputation method was used for assigning missing data on income. There was no validation or comparison between imputed and non-imputed data.

Cubbin et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2005 NHIS - CCS. Among 7,688 former smokers and current everyday smokers who were 25-64 years old and provided information on the brand of cigarettes they used, the prevalence of menthol cigarette use was significantly higher in African American female and inalc current everyday smokers (77,9% and 69.7%, respectively) and former smokers (72.7% and 66.0%, respectively) compared with their Hispanic and White counterparts (14,6% and 35.6% in current smokers, respectively; 14.5% and 34.9% in former smokers, respectively).

Mendiondo et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2005 NHIS - CCS survey. The study found

that among 6,055 current menthol smokers, 55.6 percent were female (41.7% in 5,949

nonmenthol smokers), 33.1 percent were African American (3.8% in nonmenthol smokers),

20.8 percent resided in the Northeast (15.0% in nonmenthol smokers), 222 percent had less

than a high school education (20.2% in nonmenthol smokers), 27.1 percent had an annual                          ^

income of less than $20,000 (21.9% in nonmcnthol smokers). Among former menthol                               W

smokers, 60.7 percent were female (39.9% in the nonmcnthol group), and 19.1 percent were                      o

African American (3.6% in the nonmenthol group).

Stahre ct al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2005 NHTS - CCS (n = 31,428). They found that 42 percent of the study subjects reported being either a current (n = 6,511 or 21%) or former (n = 6,774 or 21%) smoker. Of 12,004 study subjects for which menthol cigarette status was known, approximately 26 percent of current smokers smoked menthol cigarettes and 22 percent of former smokers had used menthol. Overall, menthol smoking prevalence was significantly different by gender, region, race, marital status, and quantity of cigarettes smoked per day. African American smokers had the highest prevalence of menthol cigarette use (76% for current smokers; 63% for former smokers) compared with White and other racial groups (20% and 33% in current White and Asian American smokers, respectively; 21 % and 30% in former White and Asian American smokers, respectively). More female smokers (33% for both current and former smokers) used menthol than male smokers did (22% for current smokers and 18% for former smokers). Participants 18-24 years old had the highest prevalence of menthol use for bolh currenl and former smokers (32% and 34%) compared with other age groups (23-28% for current smokers; 19-28% for former smokers). Among both current and former smokers, menthol smokers smoked fewer cigarettes per day (15 for current smokers and 17 for former smokers) compared with nonmenlhol smokers (17 for current and 19 for former smokers).

National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)

The NSDUII is an annual nationwide household survey with a nationally representative sample of population 12 years old or over. This study was of a nationally representative sample with a reasonable response rate of 75 percent. However, smoking status was based on selt-report, and there was a small sample size for certain racial groups (Asian American and American Indian/Alaska Native).

O'Connor et al (2005) analyzed data from the 2002 NSDUII and reported that Newport (exclusively menthol brand at time of study) was the dominant brand among African American smokers under age 26 years old. Among 12-17 year olds, 54. J percent smoked Newport Full Flavor (FF) and 13.5 percent smoke Newport Lights, while among 18-25 year olds, 70.6 percent smoke Newport FF and 9.1 percent smoke Newport Lights. By contrast, only 36.7 percent of African American smokers over age 26 smoked Newport FF and 4.2 percent smoked Newport Lights. Since this study was reported in the form of a Letter to the Editor, details of the study were limited and there was no description of the study population.

Rock and associates (2010) analyzed combined data from the 2004 - 2008 nsduh to assess menthol cigarette use among current smokers. Rock reported that 35.7 percent of current smokers 12 years old or over smoked menthol cigarettes. In this population, more than half of menthol smokers were females (52.2%) compared with 43.0 percent of nonmenthol smokers. About 29.4 percent of all menthol smokers were African American, which was almost 10 times the percentage of nonmenthol smokers who were African American (3.0%). For Hispanic and Asian American smokers, the percentages of menthol and nonmenthol smokers were approximately the same. White smokers represented more than half of the menthol smokers (54%). Approximately 71.2 percent of ail menthol smokers were adults 26 years old and over, 23.0 percent were young adults 18-25 years old, and 5.8 percent were youth 12-17 years old compared with 77.5 percent, 19.2 percent, and 3.4 percent of all nonmenthol smokers

of the same age groups, respectively.

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

FDA analyzed demographic characteristics of over 5,000 smokers participating in NHANES from 1999-2008. Unlike the previously discussed surveys, menthol use data were collected through barcode scanning of the participants' cigarette packs. Thus, there is no opportunity for misclassification. As has been reported previously, menthol cigarette use was more common in female smokers than male smokers and in African American smokers compared to White smokers.

Conclusion

Multiple large scale surveys and studies of nationally representative populations show consistency in the patterns of use of menthol cigarettes. The five studies that reported from CPS-TOS data found that menthol cigarette use was more common among smokers who were female, African American, had a lower education, and younger (Alexander ct al., 2010; Fagan et al., 2010; Fernander el al., 2010; Lawrence et al., 2010; Trinidad ct al., 2010). The four studies that reported from N YTS data found that menthol cigarette use was more common among smoking students who were African American and Hispanic, and thai there was an inverse relationship by grade (Appleyard ct al.} 2001; llersey et al., 2006; llersey et al., 2010; Wachowski ct al., 2007). The three studies that reported on data from the NJITS found that menthol cigarette use was more common among smokers who were female, African American and had lower education (Cubbin et al., 2010; Mcndiondo et al, 2010; Stahre ct al., 2010). The two studies that reported on NSDUII data found that menthol cigarette use was more common among smokers who were African American, female, and under age 26 (O'Connor ct al., 2005; Rock et al., 2010). The FDA analysis of NHANHS data found that menthol cigarette smokers were more likely to be female and African American. The varied nature of these studies and the large number of analyses performed on this data, which provide consistent findings, enable researchers to draw clear conclusions. Most of the surveys relied on self-reported data to categorize menthol and nonmcnthol smokers. Use of such self-reported data arc standard in the research field. Although studies that relied on self-report of menthol or nonmenthol use may have potential misclassifications, this is not necessarily a problem. As noted by Caraballo et al (2011), it is likely that this type of bias is fairly constant over time. Data support that (1) a majority of African American smokers reported menthol cigarette use and other minority groups were more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than White smokers, (2) younger smokers had the highest rate of smoking menthol cigarettes, (3) female smokers were more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes, and (4) menthol smokers were more likely to have lower education levels and lower incomes compared with nonmenthol smokers. From published studies and FDA analysis of the 1999-2008 NI1ANES data with nationally representative samples, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is associated with particular patterns of smoking.

	Menthol cigarettes are disproportionately smoked by adolescents, blacks/African Americans, adult females, those living in the Northeast of the United States and those with family incomes lower than $50,000. Based on self-reports of menthol cigarette use, menthol cigarette use among smokers have increased from 2004 to 2008.

The epidemiological literature on menthol cigarettes and cancer risk is inconclusive regarding whether these cigarettes confer a risk for cancer above that of nonmentrtolated varieties. Available data indicate that mentholated cigarettes are at least as dangerous as their nonmenthoiated counterparts. In addition, because mentholation improves the taste of cigarettes for a substantial segment of the smoking population and appears to mask disease symptoms, tils additive may facilitate initiation or inhibit quitting.

	Onnne Analysis
	Data on the Cigarette brand preferences of smokers in the 2002 US National Survey on Drug Use and Health from three age groups; 12-17,18-25 years, and 26+ years.
	12-17 je&s [n = 2290j, 18-25 years (n = 7321). 26+ years (n = 5238).
	The youth market in the JSA appears dominates by varieties of the major advertised brands, other products makB up a more modest percentage of the market. Conversely, the adult market is much more diffuse, with the major varieties commanding smaller overall percentages of the market. Light varieties appear to be popular choices for younger smokers. Similar investigations in other countries could shed further light on younger smokers' brand choices, particularly in those countries that have banned descriptors such as "Light" and "Mild".

�    Marketing and Consumer Perception of Risk

Marketing plays a role in promoting consumer products, and touches each of us every day, whether we see a television commercial for children's cereal, a billboard for car insurance, or hear a radio ad for pet food. These ads influence consumer choices, and the tobacco industry uses proven marketing tools to market tobacco as well. In order to determine how marketing influences smokers, PDA examined data on trends in the marketing of menthol cigarettes. In addition, this chapter reviews consumer perceptions of menthol cigarettes. In particular, this chapter reviews marketing articles related to trends in brand preference and marketing strategics used to promote menthol cigarettes as well as consumer perceptions literature related to the risks and benefits of using menthol cigarettes, in an effort to determine what role, if any, marketing plays in the use of menthol cigarettes and the relationship between consumer perceptions and the use of menthol. Of particular interest is whether these relationships are present among subpopulations(e.g. youth, African Americans, Ilispanics, women).

Marketing

Brand Preference

Understanding trends in brand preference allows for contextual ization of use patterns, advertising

strategies, beliefs, and the process of establishing brand loyalty. The data overwhelmingly support

distinct trends in adolescent brand preference, with a much more heavily concentrated preference

evident among adolescents than adults (Cummings et al, 1997, Pollay et al, 1996). The majority of                  ^

teens report Marlboro as their preferred brand, followed by Newport and Camel (CDC, 1994;                          w

CDC, 1992; Cummings et al., 1997; Johnston et al., 1999; O'Connor, 2005). Newport's popularity                  o
pgNbr=761
among teens doubled from i 989-1996, from 8.3 percent to 16.4 percent (Johnston et al., (999; Kaufman etal., 2004).

Research suggests adolescent brand preference is not a mere imitation of adult brand preference (Cumraings et al., 1997; Pollay, 1996). Cummings et al. (1997) found that adult and adolescent brand preferences differ within communities, suggesting something other than modeling is influencing adolescent brand preference. Pollay et al. (1996) found that analysis of brand and behavior survey along with market share and ad expenditure data supported econometric studies that report teens' brand preference is three times more sensitive to cigarette ads than adults. This is further supported by teens overwhelming preference for the top three most heavily advertised brands (American Legacy Foundation, 2007; Arnettet al., 1998; CDC, 2009; CDC, 1992; Pollay et al., 1996). National surveys typically do not tease out sub-brand preference (e.g. Marlboro Menthol), which may cause difficulties in making an absolute judgment about menthol versus nonmenthol brand preference; menthol sub-brands make up only a small percentage of the market for Marlboro and Camel. Until 2010, Newport was an exclusively menthol brand. Thus, Marlboro and Camel are most oflen reported as nonmenthol brands and Newport as a menthol brand,

Evidence suggests differences in brand preference by age, race or ethnicity, and region. Brand loyalty begins in adolescence. The number of teens who report they do not have a brand preference declines dramatically with age (Johnston, et al, 1999). Data indicates that preference for certain nonmenthol cigarettes (Marlboro and Camel) neither changes with age (Mowry, 2004), nor rises in popularity (Johnston et al, 1999). Newport use suggests a different trajectory of preference. Data suggest mat preference for Newport declines with age, with 22 percent of 8th graders reporting a preference tor Newport and 13 percent of 12th graders reporting this preference (CDC, 1994; CDC et al, 1992; Johnston et al., 1999). O'Connor (2005) found Newport's popularity declines dramatically after age 26. According to the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the decline in preference for Newport by age is found across races and ethnicities. Whereas 78.7 percent of African American smokers and 24.8 percent of Hispanic smokers 12-25 years old report using Newport cigarettes, only 48.4 percent of African American smokers and 13 percent of Hispanic smokers ages 26+ report using Ncwports. Newport preference among Caucasians declines from 11.4 percent in 12-25 year olds to 3.3 percent in smokers 26+ years old. Newport is overwhelmingly preferred by African Americans, with 41 percent of African American adults and 75 percent of African American youth reporting preference tor Newport cigarettes (Cummings ct al, 1987; Cummings, 1997; Johnston et al, 1999; O'Connor, 2005). Johnston et al. (1999) found a slight preference for the Newport brand among Hispanic youth. Additionally, some evidence suggests regional differences, with more cigarette smokers reporting a preference for Newport in the Northeast than in the West (OAS, 2003; CDC, 1994; Johnston et al., 1999). These regional differences in Newport use exist for African American, White, and Hispanic smokers. CDC reports from 1994 suggest regional preferences for Newport combined with a decrease in overall advertisement expenditures for Newport may have resulted from a heavier reliance on a regional marketing strategy than a national strategy. Differences in menthol versus nonmenthol brands by age, race, and region may suggest differences in marketing strategies, as described below.

Similar to other consumer products, evidence indicates tobacco companies employ targeted marketing strategics to attract consumers to their brands. These strategies include using market research with target audiences to inform product placement and marketing, strategic placement of advertising, partnerships with relevant national and community organizations, and use of specific promotions to encourage use. Samji (2008) reviewed a collection of several thousand cigarette advertisements from 1920-1954 and that found these ads attempt to convey a health benefit through endorsements by physicians, with menthol advertising suggesting a therapeutic, soothing benefit. Anderson (2011) reviewed industry documents that further revealed cigarette marketing on a health platform conveying to consumers that menthol cigarettes were healthier thannonmenthol.

Research indicates tobacco companies with menthol brands use a marketing mix and concepts that target African Americans (Altman et at,, 1991; Balback et al., 2003; Boley et al� 2010; Cummings et al, 1987; Glantz et al., 2006; Landrine et al� 2005; 1 -aws et al., 2002; Sutton ct al., 2004; White et ah, 2006). This is reflected in advertising placement, with magazines with primarily African American readership containing more menthol advertisements than nonmenthol advertisements and more menthol advertisements than those magazines with primarily White readership (Balbach ct al., 2003; Cummings ct al., 1987; Landrine et al., 2005) and more outdoor menthol advertisements in African American neighborhoods than neighborhoods of other races/elhnicitics (Altman et al., 1991; Hcnriksen et al, 2011; Laws et al., 2002; Seidcnberg et al., 2010). A review of publicly available tobacco industry documents conducted by Ycrger, Przewoznik, and Malone (2007) describes the tobacco industry's use of free sampling, mobile vans, event sponsorships, and special inner-city sales programs to promote sales of menthol brands to African American communities. Anderson (2011) identified a similar pattern. An observational study conducted in Hawaii to examine the number of ads inside and outside of retail establishments found Kool, the most heavily u^d brand by middle schoolers, to have the most ads inside and outside retail establishments (Glantz et al., 2006). Industry documents and observational reviews suggest themes that reflect an urban, "cool" lifestyle have been used in advertising campaigns and product names to promote menthol cigarettes to the African American community (Gardiner, 2004: Sutton et al, 2004).

Connolly ct al. (2011) found evidence of similar targeted marketing strategies in Japan which

were used to increase the preference for menthol cigarettes among women. The study found that

by 2000, half of all female smokers were smoking menthol cigarettes and that menthol use among

adolescents was significantly higher than in the general population of smokers. While the

Japanese National Health and Nutrition Survey did not measure cigarette use by brand and

subbrand, evidence indicated that smoking rates increased significantly among the younger female

cohort (20-29 years old) between 1989 and 2004, when menthol cigarettes were introduced into

the Japanese market. The authors determined this rise in smoking among women was being driven

hi large part by the uptake in smoking by young girls- who, according to the youth smoking

measure, are smoking primarily menthol cigarettes. The authors supported this data with

illustrations from industry documents that detail marketing strategics to promote a lighter, more

feminine cigarette to women in Japan. The marketing strategies appear to build on social and

cultural norms and rely on brand extension strategies of already popular brands (e.g. Marlboro).                     g

tobacco companies conducting extensive market research with African Americans to better understand trends, attitudes, preferences, and behaviors and target their marketing strategies accordingly (Boley et a!., 2010; Cruz et al� 2010; Gardiner, 2004; Johnson et al, 2008; Sutton et al., 2004). Johnson et al. (2008) and Gardiner (2004) also noted industry documents that suggest players in the tobacco industry formed strategic partnerships with national and community African American organizations to gain support for their menthol brands. Klausncr's (2011) review of industry documents suggests this targeted marketing strategy occurred afler manufacturers realized certain smokers, including African Americans, were disproportionately smoking menthol cigarettes. In the 1970s and 1980s, tobacco companies began using targeted marketing strategies to promote smoking behavior trends that were noted around this time. The studies of industry documents have limitations, though, that should be considered when evaluating their validity and reliability1.

Mazis ct al. (1992) conducted a study to examine the relationship between perceived age and attractiveness of models in tobacco advertisements in magazines. They found that models who were judged to be younger were rated as more attractive by participants. The authors noted that ads with models perceived as younger appeared more often in magazines with younger readerships. They also found that menthol ads featured models with a younger perceived age (25.7 years old) than those featured in norunenthol ads (31.9 years old). The authors concluded, however, that given the limited number of ads with a clearly portrayed model, tobacco companies were probably not using younger models as a primary marketing strategy to attract youth.

White et al. (2006) found differences by brand in the use of promotional coupons as a marketing strategy^ even when controlling for household income. They analyzed data from the 2002 California Tobacco Survey, including a question asking about how often the consumer look advantage of advertising promotions and about how often the consumer sees such promotions when purchasing cigarettes, The authors found that smokers of Newport and Kool cigarettes (both menthol brands) used coupons more often than those who purchased Marlboro and Camel cigarettes (both nonmenthol brands). Additionally, they found that African Americans who smoked menthol cigarettes (65%) used coupons more often than African Americans who smoked nonmenthol cigarettes (28%). The study also found that those who saw promotions more frequently were more likely to take advantage of them. This data suggest menthol smokers take advantage of price promotions more often than nonmenthol smokers. However, this study analyzed data only from California, so the results may not be representative of promotion use patterns in the rest of the United States,

Ilenrisken et al. (2011) examined variations in the price and availability of promotions of menthol and nonmenthol cigarettes as a function of neighborhood demographics. Researchers coded the presence of advertised promotions and lowest pack price in over 400 stores in 31 neighborhoods

in California. Researchers found that 25 percent of the advertisements recorded were for menthol cigarettes. Menthol advertisements were particularly common in areas with higher proportions of African Americans and youth 10-17 years old. The proportion of stores that advertised promotions for Newport (menthol), Marlboro Menthol, and Marlboro (nonmenthol) were 27 percent, 51.4 percent, and 75 percent, respectively. When analyzed further, researchers found that for every 10 percent increase in the proportion of African American students in the neighborhood, the odds of a store advertising promotions for Newport were 1.5 times greater. Similarly, for every 10 percent increase m the proportion of youth 10-17 years old in the neighborhood, the odds of a store advertising promotions for Newport was 5.3 times greater. Although like others who have observed Newport are priced higher than Marlboro (nonmenthol), the authors reported that average price per pack for Newport appeared to be related to the racial makeup of neighborhoods, with the price of Newport decreasing $.12 for each 10 percent point increase in African American students. The amount of discount for Newport did not appear to be related to neighborhood demographics. No relationship between neighborhood demographics, promotions advertised, and/or price was found for Marlboro Menthol or Marlboro (nonmenthol).

Some data suggest differences in the influence of advertising receptivity on smoking behavior based on smoking stains, gender, race or ethnicity, and age. Although there does not appear to be a validated measure of tobacco industry marketing exposure and receptivity, researchers define ad receptivity as the influence of tobacco marketing on an individual's attitudes, preferences, and behaviors (Evans, 1995). In the case of tobacco advertising, one hypothesis suggests that an individual's receptivity to advertising may predict initiation, preference, and continued use. Sargent ct al. (2009) suggest the influence of advertising receptivity on initiation may vary by smoking status, whereby those who have not yet initiated smoking may be more influenced by smoking in movies than tobacco advertisements and promotions. Upon initiation, however, teens may become more receptive to tobacco advertising, and receptivity to tobacco marketing may further stimulate experimentation. Choi et al. (2002) also found that adolescents who were experimenters and were found to be highly receptive to advertising were 70 percent more likely to become established smokers at follow-up than those who were minimally receptive. Several studies included in the T-ovato et al. (2003) review found gender differences in receptivity, whereby advertising receptivity was influential for girls but not boys. Research also suggests susceptible never smoking African Americans and Hispanics may be less likely to be receptive to tobacco advertising than never smoking White adolescents (Chen et al., 2002; West et al., 2007). Chen et al. (2002) only found a statistically significant relationship between receptivity and smoking for White and Hispanic youth. Evans (1995) found younger adolescents scored higher on measures of ad receptivity than older adolescents. Studies of advertising receptivity did not examine differences between menthol smokers and nonmenthol smokers nor were differences in receptivity to menthol versus nonmenthol advertisements studied.

Consumer Perceptions

Richter et al. (2006) conducted focus groups and found differences in perceived risk by race.
pgNbr=765
While White participants reported menthol cigarettes to be safer than nonmenthol cigarettes, African American participants believed there were no differences in risk between types of cigarettes. Hispanic participants were twice as likely as While participants to rank menthol cigarettes as safer than light cigarettes. African Americans reported the highest preference for menthol cigarettes, and Hispanic participants reported a slight preference. Researchers did not control for the type of cigarette smoked�menthol or nonmenthol�in the analysis. Richter (2008) held a follow up set of focus groups with African Americans in Atlanta and found the discussion around risk and harm to yield mixed results among the different focus groups. While some participants ^cd menthol cigarettes were less harsh and irritating to the body, other, believed they were worse for the body and more addictive. During a ranking exercise conducted with several of the groups, one group ranked menthol cigarettes as less harsh than nonmenthol cigarettes. Additionally, during these group exercises participants reported taste as the primary driver behind their preference for menthol cigarettes and talked about the perceived "cool factor" they believed was promoting use among African Americans and youth. While focus groups provide useful formative and illustrative information, the qualitative nature of the data makes it impossible to draw causal conclusions or to generalize to a larger population.

Unlike Richter ct a(. (2006), Wackowski et a). (2010) found that African Americans surveyed in New Jersey were twice as likely as Whites to report menthol cigarettes as more risky than nonmenthol cigarettes, with young adults being three times as likely as adults to think menthol cigarettes were more risky. Among smokers and non-smokers surveyed, 70 percent reported menthol cigarettes were just as risky as nonmenthol cigarettes. Only 4 percent of all respondents and 2.4 percent of menthol smokers believed menthol cigarettes were less risky than nonmenthol cigarettes. Almost one-third of menthol smokers surveyed reported menthol cigarettes were more risky than nonmenthol cigarettes. Davis et al. (2010) found similar results from an analysis of the 2009 HeafthStyles survey (n^4,556).

Allen et al. (2010) developed a scale to measure attitudes and beliefs about menthol cigarettes among African American smokers. Researchers identified five factors for the scale: medicinal effects, image, less harmful, tradition, aud menthol taste or sensation. They piloted the scale on 720 African American smokers (57% menthol only, 15% nonmenthol only). Findings were mixed based on age, gender, and education. Older respondents had higher scores on medical effects, image, and less harmful. Men had higher scores on medical effects, image, and tradition, while women had higher scores on taste. Education was inversely associated with scores on the medicinal effects, image, less harmful, and tradition factors, with less educated subjects having higher scores.

Lee and Glantz (2011) suggest differences in consumer perception by age may be a related to

exposure to early industry advertisements that promoted the health benefits of menthol. This would

suggest that older smokers who were exposed to these messages may perceive menthol as less

harmful than younger smokers were not exposed to such messages do. Additional research is

needed to test this hypothesis.                                                                                                                       cj

Conclusion

Many of the studies on the marketing of menthol cigarettes and consumer perceptions of menthol cigarettes were cross-sectional or qualitative m nature and therefore a clear relationship cannot be drawn.

As seen in nonmenthol cigarettes and other consumer goods, marketing has a strong influence on consumer brand preference and use. The relationship between advertising expenditures and brand preference and the research supporting teen sensitivity to advertising illustrates this reality. Based on numerous studies (including American Legacy Foundation, 2007; Amett et al., 1998; Altman et aL, 1991; Balback ct al., 2003; Boly et al., 2010; Connolly et al., 2011; Cummings et aL, 1987; Cummings et al., 1997; Glantz et al., 2006; Johnston et al., 1999; Landrine et al., 2005; Laws et al., 2002; O'Connor, 2005; Pollay, 1996; Samaji, 2008; Sutton et al, 2004; White et al., 2006), it appears that a targeted marketing mix of price, promotion, product, and place promotes menthol cigarette use among youth and among African Americans in urban communities. Ft is likely, however, that factors in addition to marketing contribute to the preference and use of menthol cigarettes among consumers. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that, like nonmenthol cigarettes, the marketing of menthol cigarettes is likely associated with brand preference. The marketing of menthol cigarettes is associated with menthol brand preference among adolescents and the African American community.

Overall, the results appear to be mixed in the perceived risk of menthol cigarettes. While the reviewed studies suggest that people may be more likely to report menthol cigarettes as less risky or just as risky as nonmenthol cigarettes, design limitations prevent researchers from drawing solid conclusions. Additionally, limited use of validated forms of measuring risk perceptions of menthol cigarettes suggests participants may vary in their ways of defining "risk" and "harm." None of the reviewed articles examined risk perceptions of menthol cigarettes among youth. Given the limited data reviewed and mixed results reported, the weight of evidence is not sufficient to support a conclusion that consumer perceptions are associated with the use of menthol cigarettes.

The role of mentholated cigarettes may also change if the court's order prohibiting the use of light and related descriptors is upheld. If light cigarettes are no longer sold, more youth may turn to mentholated cigarettes since menthol makes these cigarettes easier to smoke than regular cigarettes. Currently, 37% of youth smokers (and 81 % of African-Americans) report usually smoking menthol cigarettes. Currently, 40% of youth smokers report usually smoking menthol cigarettes. Clearly, this type of cigarette has appeal among youth and may increase smoking uptake.

Japan provides an excellent case-study on the impact of the introduction and marketing of menthol brands to young women and initiation into smoking. Smoking prevalence in Japan has been declining among men for decades, but rates of smoking among women have recently increased. The internal tobacco documents demonstrate the intent of lobacco manufacturers to increase inii'ation among young females through development and marketing of menthol brands. Adolescent survey data provides evidence that the uplake of smoking among high school aged girls in Japan is largely via menthol brands. Adult survey data, though not segmented by brand type (e.g., menthol), indicates that the increased uptake of smoking among young girts has translated to rising smoking rates among young women as these cohorts age, The Japan experience suggests the importance of brand targeting as a vehicle to capitalize on social changes and encourage initiation and use among a historically nonsmoking population________________________

Few adults (D.6%), including smokers, perceived menthol cigarettes to be less harmful than nonmenthoi cigarettes. Blacks were mare likely to believe that menthol cigarettes have health benefits when compared with Whites. Almost half of current smokers believed menthol cigarettes are equally addictive as nonmenthoi cigarettes and 74.9% believed menthol and nonmenthoi cigarettes are equally hard to quit.

The documents show that menthol is added to cigarettes in part because it is known to be an attractive feature to inexperienced smokers who perceive menthol cigarettes as less harsh and easier to smoke and because of their availability from friends and family. Second, the tobacco industry found that some youths smoke menthols because they perceive them to be less harmful than non-menthol cigarettes. A key product design issue concerns whether to increase brand menthol levels to appeal to the taste preferences of long-term menthol smokers or keep menthol levels lower to appeal to inexperienced smokers. Marketing studies showed that the companies carefully researched the menthol segment of the market in order to recruit younger smokers !o their brands. The industry tracked menthol cigarette usage by age, gender and race to inform product development and marketing decisions.

Tobacco companies shaped consumer perceptions of menthol cigarettes. Menthol is not just a flavouring agent. Cigarette companies use mertthoi's ability io mask irritation and provide sensory effects to make menthol cigarettes appeal to youth and health-concerned smokers, In part because menthol makes tow-tar cigarettes more palatable. Consistent with targeted marketing, youths, women and African Americans disproportionately smoke menthois. There appear to be compfex interactions with addictive effects of nicotine. The ubiquitous addition of menthol by tobacco companies to over 90% of all tobacco products, whether labelled menthol' or not, demonstrates that menthol is not simply a flavour or brand. Mer#iol imparts sensory characteristics to cigarettes and has a complex interacflon with nicotine that affects smoking behaviour whether it is peroeiwed or not, or whether cigarettes containing menthol are marketed as'menthol' or not. Adding menthol increases fine particles in cigarette smoke, which have immediate adverse effects on the risk of heart attack.

The youth market in the USA appears dominated by varieties of the major advertised brands: other products make up a more modest percentage of the market. Conversely, the aduli market is much more diffuse, with the major varieties commanding smaller overall percentages of the market. Light varieties appear to be popular choices for younger smokers. Similar investigations in omer countries could shed further light on younger smokers' brand choices, particularly in those countries that have banned descriptors such as "light" and "Mild".

F,     Initiation and Progression to Regular Use

Close to 90 percent of adult smokers in the United States started to smoke before age 18

(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, 2009; U.S. Department of

Health and Human Services, 2012). Thus, youth and young adulthood appear to be critical

developmental periods for initiation of cigarette smoking. Menthol cigarettes may have an

impact on initiation rates and progression to regular use that differ from nonmcnthol cigarettes.

Since even a small increase in the rate of initiation of cigarette smoking may have a large

impact on public health, assessing this possible impact is important. Although some

assessments of initiation have included data on switching behavior (i.e. switching between

menthol and nonmcnthol preferences), this is not included in the current assessment due to

difficulties in interpretation. This report assesses the available, though limited, data on the

possible impact of menthol cigarettes on initiation of cigarette smoking and progression to

regular use, and focuses primarily on smoking behavior by youth and young adults. Given that

no large scale, carefully designed cohort study has been carried out to clearly delineate                                 ^

initiation dynamics (progression from experimentation to regular smoking), this assessment                          w

examines both age and period data estimates from many data sources.                                                           o

Differences in preference rates

Appleyard et al. (2001) analyzed data from the 2000 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), using data from 35,828 middle and high school students from across the country tor a cross-sectional survey of school-age children. They found that, among those surveyed who reported smoking in the past 30 days, 32 percent of White middle and high school students said their usual brand of cigarette was a menthol brand, as compared to higher values of Asian American (58%), Hawaiian/Pacific Islander (46%), African American (74%) and Hispanic (51%) middle and high school students who reported that they usually smoke menthol cigarettes. An overall number of youth who regularly smoke nonmenthol cigarettes was not provided. This study included a nationally representative population with a high response rate and adequate representation from most racial or ethnic groups. Participating students were from both public and private schools; however results may not generalize to students in non-traditional schools.

Hersey et al. (2006) analyzed data from over 1700 participants of the National Youth Tobacco Survey and found that, after adjusting for demographic differences, menthol use was more common among newer, younger smokers. Younger adolescents were more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes as compared to older adolescents, with both age groups increasing in menthol cigarette use from 2000 to 2002. in 2000,52 percent of middle school smokers and 37 percent of high school smokers reported menthol cigarette use. In 2002, this percentage increased for both age groups (60% of middle school youth, 44% of high school youth). Rock ct al. (2010) found similar results, and addressed the issue of misclassificationof the kind of cigarettes smoked through a modification of the response options.

Lawrence et al. (2010), in a cross-sectional study of adults, analyzed data from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS. As with Appleyard et al. (2001), this study found that the prevalence of smoking menthol cigarettes was highest in participants 18-24 years old. Smokers in the 18-24 and 45-64 year old age groups were approximately 1.4 and 1.3 times as likely, respectively, to be menthol smokers as compared to smokers in the 65 years old or over age group. There was no significant difference between the 25-44-year age group and the 65 years age group (CJ1.07; 0,89-1.28). This suggested that smokers 65 years old or over tend to smoke menthol cigarettes at a lower rate than other age groups (Lawrence et al., 2010).

Hersey et al. (2010) analyzed data from the cross-sectional 2006 National Youth Tobacco

Survey, a survey of over 27,000 students in grades 6-12. They found that youth (n=3281) who

smoked in the past month were more likely to report smoking menthol cigarettes at rates

inversely proportional to age. Of middle school students who reported smoking in the past

month, over 50 percent reported smoking menthol cigarettes, whereas of high school students

who reported smoking in the past month, 43 percent reported smoking menthol cigarettes.

Differences exist in prevalence of menthol smoking depending on race and ethnicity, with

African American youth reporting the highest prevalence (80.6% middle school smokers and

84.8% high school smokers), followed by both Hispanics (57.9% and 56.4% for middle and high

school smokers) and Asian Americans (57.4% middle school smokers and 43.6% high school

smokers). White youth smokers reported the lowest levels, but still higher than that seen in

adults. Among current non-Hispanic White smokers who smoked in the past month, 43.1

en
pgNbr=786
percent and 37.6 percent for middle and high school smokers smoked menthol cigarettes. This study included a large nationally representative population with a high response rate (80.2%) and weighted estimates, used three menthol smoking status definitions to model the relationship between menthol cigarette use, and included a nicotine dependence measure to assess the robustness of the association.

Rocket al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2004-2008 NSDUH (n-71,605) and found that 35.7 percent of current smokers 12 years old or over smoked menthol cigarettes. Among smokers age 12-17,71.9 percent of African American youth reported smoking menthol cigarettes, followed by 51.5 percent of Asian Americans, 47.0 percent of Hispanics, 41.0 percent of Whites, and 34.7 percent of American Indian/Alaska Natives. This pattern remained relatively consistent among 18-25 year olds, with a slight increase for African American smokers (85%). Among adult smokers 26 years old or over in the survey, the prevalence of current menthol use was only modestly lower (and still high) for African American smokers (82,2%), however rates were much lower for Hispanics (29.5%), Asian Americans (28.6%), American Indian/Alaska Natives (23%), and Whites (21.9%). From 2004 to 2008, menthol cigarette smoking among White smokers 12-17 years old increased from 40.3 percent to 46.0 percent In addition, menthol cigarette use among individuals 18-25 years old increased for Hispanic (from 33.9% lo 42.4%) and White (from 26.7% lo 32.5%) smokers. 1 rius, not only were younger smokers more likely to be menthol smokers, but prevalence may be increasing.

Fernander et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS. They found that current smokers 18-24 years old were more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes. Odds ratios indicated that, relative to the 65+ year group, smokers who were 18-24 years old, 25-44 years old, and 45-65 years old were significantly more likely to be menthol smokers (66Vo, 20%, and 22%, respectively).

First smoking experience

Fletcher et al. (2006) analyzed data collected during the CARDTA study, which included date from 972 menthol and 563 nonmenthol smokers (18-30 years old), lliey found that there was no difference in age of first cigarette use when comparing menthol and nonmenthol smokers; both groups smoked their first cigarette at an average age of 16, This was a cohort study with a long follow up period. Although not nationally representative, there was a diverse group of participant,. Participants were limited to adults 30 years old and younger, which was appropriate to assess smoking initiation.

Okuyemi et at. (2004) analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey of 480 African American smokers and asked about age of first cigarette use as part of the subjects' demographic and smoking characteristics. No significant differences were found; menthol smokers smoked their first cigarette on average at 15 years old, nonmenthol smokers at around 16 years old. Although there were more menthol smokers (n=407) than nonmenthol smokers (if73), there was sufficient power to make statistically comparisons between these two groups.

Gandhi et al. (2009) analyzed data from 1,688 patients of a specialist smoking cessation service. No differences were found in the age at which menthol and nonmenthol smokers reported first
pgNbr=787
using tobacco. For menthol smokers, "age first used tobacco" was an average of 14.87 years old; for nonmenthol smokers, "age first used tobacco" was an average of 15.21 years old. The study included comparable numbers of menthol (n^778) and nonmenthol (n=910) smokers, however generalizability may be limited because of the use of a non-nationally representative community sample and the inclusion of only those who were seeking smoking cessation treatment.

Progression to regular smoking

Hyland et al. (2002) analyzed data (n~ 13,268) from the Community Intervention Trial for Smoking Cessation (COMMTT), a telephone tobacco use survey in 1988 with re-interviews in 1993. When "age started smoking" of menthol smokers was compared with nonmenthol smokers, there were no significant differences. This study used 11 matched pairs of communities (10 in the United States and one in Canada), which decreased confounding by pairing controls with similar groups, and had a large sample size. However, there was a lack of definition of "age started smoking" so it is unknown if this refers to first experience or to onset of regular smoking, Generalizability may be limited due to the use of a community based sample that was not nationally representative.

Okuyemi et al. (2004) surveyed a cross-section of 480 inner-city African American smokers and examined the relationship between menthol smoking and smoking cessation. This survey examined sociodemographics, smoking characteristics, and smoking cessation experiences of participants and compared menthol smokers (nr407) to nonmenthol smokers (n^73). No differences were seen in age of onset of regular smoking. The inclusion of only African American smokers is both a strength and a limitation of the study. It limits generalizability but also eliminates the effect of disproportionate subgroup size (see Fagan et al., 2010 and Fernaiider et al, 2010). Although the sample sizes were small, there was sufficient power to make comparisons.

Okuyemi et al. (2007) conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial looking at African American "light" smokers (n=755). "Light" refers to a low number of cpd smoked, and does not refer to the cigarettes themselves. In this case, a light smoker is defined as one who smoked 10 or fewer cpd. No differences were found in "age started smoking regularly" between menthol and nonmenthol smokers. The study included a large number of participants, however, the majority (81.7%) was self-identified menthol smokers. Despite this uneven distribution, there appears to be sufficient statistical power to compare these groups. The inclusion of only African American smokers of 10 or fewer cpd limits the generalizability of the findings (see Fagan et al., 2010 and Femander et al., 2010).

Fagan ct al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS to study progression to regular smoking. The study compared the age of onset of "fairly regular smoking" of menthol and nonmenthol smokers. Smokers were defined as those who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes, however no formal definition tor "smoking fairly regularly" was given, Covariates included age, race or ethnicity, marital status, and socioeconomic variables, as well as total years smoked daily and smoking status 12 months ago. Since African Americans typically initiate smoking at later ages (Finkenaucr ct al., 2009), it was important to include race or ethnicity as a covariate. Menthol smokers started smoking regularly at a later age. When investigating the age
pgNbr=788
of onset to regular smoking, menthol smokers were less likely to start before 15 years old as compared to nonmenthoi smokers or smokers with no usual type. Although there were no significant differences in the 15-17 year old groups, menthol smokers were more likely to report 18 years old or more as the age of onset of regular smoking. The tabular data had uneven racial or ethnic representations with more White smokers identifying as nonmenlhol smokers and more African Americans identifying as menthol smokers. The study had a large sample size with nationally representative data.

Like Fagan ct al. (2010), Femander et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS to study progression to regular smoking. They also assessed the age of onset of regular smoking by asking respondents, who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes, al what age (hey first started "smoking fairly regularly." Like the results from Fagan et al. (2010), menthol smokers started smoking regularly at a later age. The CPS-TUS data set contains an uneven distribution of racial or ethnic subpopulations in the cell sizes, with more White smokers identifying as nonmenthoi smokers and more African Americans identifying as menthol smokers. Hispanlcs and other minorities were more likely to smoke menthols, and African Americans tend to start smoking later, which can complicate the interpretation of what drives a later onset of progression to regular smoking in menthol smokers (see Okuyemi et al., 2004 and 2007).

Like Fagan et al. (2010) and Fcrnander et al. (2010), Lawrence et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS. A significant association exists between use of menthol cigarettes and the age of onset of regular smoking among women, but not among men. That is, women who reported smoking menthol cigarettes were more likely to report having an earlier onset of regular smoking. Importantly, however, this was limited to smokers in the 45-64 year old age group as compared to the 65 and over age group.

Cubbin ct al. (2010) analyzed cross-sectional, nationally representative data in the United States from the 2005 NHIS - CCS (n = 31,428 18 years old and over). Among current smokers (identified as having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and currently smoking some days or everyday), Cubbin et al. compared the "age of initiation" of menthol and nonmenthoi smokers and found no significant differences between menthol and nonmenthoi smokers on this measure. All analyses were adjusted for age, income, and education levels, and stratified by gender and race or ethnicity, Readers likely assume that the researchers are using data from the "How old were you when you FIRST started to smoke fairly regularly?*' question because there is no question that uses 'age of initiation' language. In addition, no indication of whether someone started out as a menthol or nonmenthoi smoker is provided. Among both menthol and nonmenlhol smokers, White smokers have been shown to initiate regular smoking one and a half to three years earlier than non-Whites (Cubbins et al., 2010).

Stahrc ct al. (2010) also analyzed data from the 2005 NHIS - CCS, which examined current smokers (n==6511) and former smokers (n=6774). No significant difference existed in the average age of first smoking regularly. Menthol smokers reported an average age of 19,6 and nonmenthoi smokers reported an average age of 19.7.
pgNbr=789
Among a set of secondary data analyses conducted in 2010 that have not been peer-reviewed, one study included an analyis related lo initiation. The Nonncmaker secondary data analysis used a measure of progression that was based on several measures, including a transition from smoking less than 100 cigarettes to smoking more than 100 cigarettes, a transition from smoking on less than 20 days per month to smoking 20 or more days per month, and a transition from nondaily smoking to daily smoking. Survey data were collected over three consecutive school years (2000-2001,2001-2002,2002-2003). Middle and high school students who initiated to menthol cigarettes during the first or second year of data collection were more likely to report being daily smokers at the third year of data collection. Racial or ethnic subpopulations were unevenly distributed, but the analysis accounted for baseline characteristics. Although this analysis pulled from a large sample, this study lacked appropriate controls for socioeconomic status, and the point estimates for other (non-progression) covariates were somewhat impiausibic due to small sample size.

Industry documents research

Two studies examined publicly available tobacco industry documents. Although utility of these kinds of studies may be limited due to unknown details related to the original data, they can be useful in providing some insight into tobacco industry communications, plans, and research. Kreslake et al. published two articles that reviewed such documents on the topic of initiation of smoking behavior. The documents mainly focused on the possible palliative effect of menthol on smoking; menthol appears lo moderate or alleviate negative sensory experiences that often accompany a first-smoking experience (Kreslake et al� 2008a). Indeed, Kreslake et ai. (2008b) also found an internal Brown and Williamson memo stating that "KooFs menthol level may be considered too high for new smokers, and that a successful 'starter' cigarette would need to include a low tobacco taste, low impact and irritation, low tobacco aftertaste and low menthol content." Although these arc single examples, they indicate tobacco industry knowledge and acceptance that menthol provides a mechanism through which new smokers are able to more successfully initiate smoking.

Conclusion

In all pccr-rcvicwcd articles, data wej^e collected through self-report. Although this could be associated with recall bias or misclassification, self-report is the standard of this research field and not considered detrimental to the study results. The data do not support the claim that a substantial number of adult respondents intentionally under-report tobacco use (Everhart et al, 2009; Yeager & Krosnick, 2010), Furthermore, as noted by Caraballo et al. (2011), while evidence exists of some self-report bias in reporting menthol or nonmenthol cigarette use, especially among adolescents, this is not necessarily problemalic since it is likely that this type of bias is fairly constant over time.

There is no indication that menthol smokers first experience cigarette smoking any earlier or later than nonmenthol smokers (Pletcher et al., 2006; Okuyemi et al., 2004; Gandhi et al., 2009). However, data regarding age of onset of regular smoking are mixed. Six studies found no difference (Hyland et al., 2002; Okuyemi et al, 2004; Okuyemi ct ai., 2007; Cubbin et al., 2010; Stahre et al., 2010; Lawrence et al., 2010 - males only), two found that menthol smokers began
pgNbr=790
regular smoking at a later age (Fagan et al., 2010; Fernauder el al., 2010), and two found that menthol smokers began regular smoking at an earlier age (Lawrence et al, 2010 - females only; Nonnemaker secondary data analysis). Data that appear to indicate that menthol smokers start smoking later than nonmenthol smokers are difficult to interpret because differences may be driven by racial or ethnic differences. Kvidence exists of significant racial or etlinic differences in early experiences with smoking and transitioning to regular smoking, with African Americans experimenting and transitioning later than White smokers (Finkenauer et ak, 2009). Age of smoking initiation may also be dependent on the ethnic background in which the smokers grow up (Baron-Epel & Ilaviv-Messika, 2004). Although there were no consistent differences to the onset of regular smoking, the non-pcer-reviewed Nonnemaker secondary data analysis indicated that those who start smoking with menthol cigarettes were more likely to progress to regular smoking.

Prevalence data from cross sectional studies make a case for Ihe involvement of menthol in the initiation process; all six studies found that youth/younger smokers were more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes as compared to older smokers (Appleyard et al., 2001; Hersey et ai� 2006; Lawrence et al., 2010; Hersey et al., 2010; Rock et al., 2010; Fernander et al., 2010). Although cohort effects could be a factor in these differences, the consistency of findings across datasets gathered from different years suggests that this is not the case. When the logical connections between and among cohorts are considered in several articles, the suggestion of greater influence on initiation dynamics grows. Younger, newer smokers prefer menthol at levels far above that of the general population, a finding that is generally consistent across racial or ethnic groups. The data that support the finding that those of younger age have greater menthol preference are consistent. This suggests that as smokers grow older, menthol preferences change. Additionally, while this is not a direct measure of individual initiation, it tracks very well to the ages that initiation typically occurs. Given that the general adult smoking population smokes menthol cigarettes at rates lower than the younger age groups, the type of cigarette chosen does not appear to be purely based on availability through parents or other adults, which suggests that younger smokers may intentionally seek out menthol cigarettes. This could be for a variety of reasons, some of which have been discussed in publicly available internal tobacco industry documents, including effects directly related to menthol (e.g., soothing or cooling effects) or for social reasons and marketing. However, as stated previously, since the studies addressing differences in menthol or nonmenthol in prevalence are all fairly recent (within the past 10 years), it is possible that these differences may be due to cohort effects. Despite this caveat, from the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with increased initiation and progression to regular use of cigarette smoking.

After adjusting for age, income and education, Mack (compared with Hispanic and white] and female (compared with male) smokers were more likely to choose menthol cigarettes. There was only one statistically significant difference tn age of initiation, cigarettes smcked per day, quit attempts or time since quitting between menthol and non-menthol smokers: white women who smoked menthol cigarettes reported longer cessation compared with those who smoked norwTienthci cigarettes.

G.    Dependence

Nicotine dependence is the primary driver of continued tobacco use and may affect the overall adverse health impact of smoking (e.g., failure of quit attempts). Researchers have used peer-reviewed literature, data from the Allria TES, and menthol secondary data analyses to evaluate the impact of nicotine dependence. This assessment includes primary measures that have historically been used to assess nicotine dependence: time to first cigarette (TTFC), cpd, the Fagcrstrftm Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND; a composite measure), and craving. Night waking to smoke has also emerged as a reliable indicator of strength of dependence and is therefore included in this assessment This assessment also includes other scales of nicotine dependence and craving if there were direct menthol versus nonmenthol assessments, particularly if they were used to assess dependence in youth. Although relapse to smoking has been used as an indicator of strength of dependence, those studies are included in the assessment of the literature on cessation later in tliis report.

Time to First Cigarette (TTFC)

Baker et al. (2007) used data from four placebo-conIroJ led smoking cessation trials and one international epidemiologic study to determine the relationships between cessation success and each of the following: FTND (Heatheiion ct al., 1991), the Heaviness of Smoking Index (Kozlowski et al., t$94), the Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Scale (Shiffman et al, 2004), and the Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (Piper et al., 2004), TTFC in the morning had the strongest predictive validity of all of the questions on the FTND and had greater validity than any other single measure. TTFC is therefore considered to be the best single measure of assessing nicotine dependence,

Fagan et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS to examine the relationship between menthol and nicotine dependence, including TTFC. All analyses were adjusted for age, income and education levels, and stratified by gender and race or ethnicity. This large (n= 46,273) cross-sectional survey found that moderate menthol smokers (6-10 cpd) were 22 percent more likely to have less than five minutes TTFC compared to nonmenthol smokers. For light smokers (< 5 cpd) or heavy smokers (11+ cpd), there were no differences associated with menthol in ITFC.

Collins and Moolchan (2006) analyzed data from a telephone survey of 572 adolescent smokers who participated in a treatment study. TTFC reported by menthol smokers was compared with nonmenthol smokers. Statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in ITFC in the five minutes or less groups, with the menthol groups significantly higher than nonmenthol groups (45% versus 29%), but no significant differences between the 6-30 minutes, 31-60 minutes, or 60 or more mimintes groups. The majority of smokers surveyed were menthol smokers (n=531) with no additional racial or ethnic breakdowns by menthol or nonmenthol preference. Since the participants were adolescents recruited from a single urban community and who were seeking treatment to stop smoking, generaiizability may be limited to other populations of smokers. Results may not hold true across communities, to adults, or to smokers who arc not seeking treatment to stop smoking.

nonrnenthol smokers and found that smokers who wake at night to smoke had a significantly shorter time before smoking their first cigarette after waking in the morning. While a direct comparison of menthol to nonrnenthol smokers and TfFC was not made, a majority of menthol smokers (57.9%) as compared to nonrnenthol smokers (45.4%) woke at night to smoke. This suggests that menthol smokers may also be more likely to have a shorter 1TFC. Generalizability may be limited by the use of a local population of smokers seeking treatment to stop smoking.

FDA's independent analysis of Altria PES data showed significantly higher nicotine dependence scores for TTFC (p=0.0374) for menthol smokers using an ordinal response model adjusting for number of cigarettes smoked, number of years smoked, total pu ft" volume, and SES or demographic character!sties. FDA did not include a tar delivery content (TDC) category in its statistical model. FDA did not want to include this in its model because models with TDC assume that a menthol user would necessarily switch to a nonrnenthol brand in the same TDC if menthol brands were no longer available.

Hyland et al. (2002) conducted a large, community-based cohort study to evaluate the associations between menthol use and future nicotine dependence using data collected in the COMMIT study. Hyland found no differences in TTFC, however the two shortest intervals that are typically used with TTFC (<5 minutes and 6-10 minutes) were combined. From other studies, the five minutes or less time period appears to be the most sensitive to differences, thus the comparison of the results of this study to others is limited.

Okuyemi ct al. (2003) analyzed data from 600 African American smokers enrolled in a clinical trial for smoking cessation. Menthol smokers (n=471) reported smoking their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking significantly more often than nonrnenthol smokers <n= 129) (81.7% compared to 69.8%). This study cannot be directly compared with other TTFC data because the TTFC bins were combined, losing all of the fastest time intervals. Data from this randomized clinical trial were sclf-rcportcd and may have limited generalizability due to the inclusion of only African Americans and an individual community sample. Furthermore, as with Hyland el al. (2002), the lack of the five minutes or less time period, which appears to be the most sensitive to differences, limits the comparison to other studies.

Muscat ct al. (2009) analyzed data from a community-based cross-sectional study of 525 African American and White hospital-based, older smokers. HFC was separated into only two broad categories. Analysis of data collected from this study found no differences in cither the 30 minutes or less or the more than 30 minutes groups. As with Hyland et al. (2002) and Okuycmi ct al. (2003), the lack of the five minutes or less time period, which appears to be the most sensitive to differences, limits the interpretation of the re.su Its of this study,

Lawrence et al (2010) analyzed data from the 2003 and 2006/2007 CPS-TUS and compared

menthol (n=16,294) and nonrnenthol smokers* (n=46,899) responses to a question asking if they

had smoked a cigarette within their first 30 minutes of waking. Lawrence et al. (2010) found no

significant difference in the responses between the two groups. As with Hyland et al. (2002),

Okuyemi et al. (2003), and Muscat et al. (2009), the lack of the five minutes or less time period,

which appears to be the most sensitive to differences, limits the comparison of the results of this

Through non-peer-reviewed secondary data analyses using the same datasct that was used previously (Muscat et al, 2009), Muscat categorized TTFC into four categories (<] 5 minutes, 15-30 minutes, 31 -60 minutes and >60 minutes). A fter adjusting for race, sex and BMT, no significant differences existed between menthol and nonmenthol smokers for TTFC. Since the previous differences have been in the five minutes or less timeframe, caution should be exercised with interpreting these results. This analysis is somewhat limited by its small sample size, and it may be difficult to generalize from its results due to the use of a community sample.

Through secondary data analyses that have not been peer-reviewed, Hyland and Kasza analyzed data from the International; Tobacco Control Four Country Survey, with data from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. Data were collected from 7,532 individuals in the United States between 2002 and 2008. This study had a large and nationally representative sample population. After adjustment for demographic and smoking behavior variables, menthol smokers reported fewer minutes to first cigarette compared to nonmenthol smokers. Additionally, the strength of this relationship differed between racial or ethnic groups, with Hispanic respondents (particularly men), experiencing the greatest difference in TTFC. Hispanic nonmenthol smokers had an average ITFC of nearly three hours, while Hispanic menthol smokers had an average time of slightly over one hour. Hie "minutes to first cigarette" (equivalent to TTFC) was, on average, an hour or more, with a median of about 20 minutes. This average is well beyond those of the previously discussed studies, This may have been influenced by a liberal definition of a smoker as someone who smokes at least one cpd, with approximately 12 percent of included smokers smoking fewer than five cpd. The authors suggest that the inclusion of these light smokers influenced the distribution, which could also limit this study's generalizability.

Cigarettes per day (cpd)

Historically, cpd has been used as an indicator of nicotine dependence, however changing policies such as smoke-free workplaces, smoking restrictions in and around public buildings and restaurant and bar smoking restrictions have made this an increasingly problematic and less-reliable indicator. These issues are exaggerated when evaluating youth smokers because adolescents are subject to greater social restrictions on smoking than adults (e.g., school and household rules, age restrictions for legal purchase). Nevertheless, given the historical record of use of cpd as an index of nicotine dependence, it is included in this discussion.

Okuyerni et al, (2003) analyzed data from 600 African American smokers who were enrolled in a clinical trial for smoking cessation. They compared cpd for menthol smokers (n=471) with cpd reported by nonmenthol smokers (n= 129). There was no difference in cpd; both groups smoked an average of 18 cpd. Although helpful in addressing issues of menthol use in this population, results cannot be generalized to menthol smokers from other racial or ethnic groups. Generalizability is also limited due to the use of a single community.

Okuyerni et al. (2004) analyzed data from a cross-sectional survey of 480 African American

smokers at an inner-city health center. Menthol smokers (n=407) were compared to nonmenthol

smokers (n=73). Both menthol and nonmenthol smokers smoked, on average, 10 cpd. Although

there were more menthol smokers than nonmenthol smokers, there was sufficient power to make

this comparison. The use of a single racial or ethnic group eliminates race or ethnicity as a possible confounder but limits the conclusions to only smokers who are African American and live in urban communities. Although helpful in addressing issues of menthol use in this population, results cannot be generalized to menthol smokers from other racial or ethnic groups.

Collins and Moolchan (2006) analyzed data from telephone interviews of 572 adolescent menthol and nonmcnthol smokers who were recruited to participate in a treatment study. Analysis with independent t-tests revealed no significant difference, with both menthol and nonmenthol smokers smoking 11-12 cpd. The majority of smokers were menthol smokers (n�531) with no additional racial or ethnic breakdowns by meiithol or nonmenthol preference. Data were not stratified by race or ethnicity. Generali/abilily may be limited due to the local sample and use of treatment-seekers. The limit to adolescence increased sensitivity to this group, but findings may not generalize to adults.

Pletcher et al. (2006) analyzed data from the CARDTA study, a longitudinal study of risk factors for coronary artery disease, including 972 menthol smokers and 563 nonmenthol smokers. Menthol smokers smoked significantly fewer cpd as compared to nonmcnthol smokers (10 and 15 cpd, respectively). Although there were reasonable numbers of menthol and nonmenlhol smokers, the majority of menthol smokers were African American while the majority of nonmenthol smokers were White. Since there was no adjustment for race or ethnicity, this difference could be due to racial/ethnic factors rather than menthol use.

Gandhi et aL (2009) evaluated the relationship between menthol cigarette smoking and short-term and Jong-term smoking cessation rates among 1,688 patients attending a tobacco treatment clinic. This retrospective clinical trial cohort study found that African American and Latino menthol smokers smoked fewer cpd than nonmenthol smokers, however there were no differences among White smokers.

Fagan et al. (2010) analyzed data from daily current smokers who were at least 18 years old and participated in the 2003 and 2005/2007 CPS-TUS, Covariatcs included age, race or ethnicity, marital status, and socioeconomic variables, as well as total years smoking daily and smoking status 12 months ago. This large (n=^ 46,273) cross-sectional, nationally representative survey found that menthol smokers smoked fewer cpd (rnean^ 13.05) compared with nonmenthol smokers (mean -15.01).

Lawrence et al. (2010) also analyzed data from the 2003 and 2005/2007 CPS-TUS. This large (n= 63,193) cross-sectional, nationally rCpresentative survey found that adult current smokers of less than 10 cpd were more likely to be menthol smokers than nonmcnthol smokers (52% as compared to 42%), while smokers of 20 or more cpd were more likely to be nonmenthol smokers compared to menthol smokers (44% as compared to 34%),

Slahre et al. (2010) analyzed data from the 2005 NH1S-CCS, a nationally representative household survey. Among current smokers (n~6511), menthol smokers reported smoking significantly fewer cpd as compared to nonmenthol smokers (14.6 and 17.5, respectively). There was no adjustment for race or ethnicity, which limits the conclusions that can be drawn since the

majority of menthol smokers were non-White while the majority of nonmenthol smokers were White.

As part of the secondary data analyses conducted in 2010 that were not peer-reviewed, Ilyland and Kasza analyzed data from adult smokers who were interviewed in the United States as part of the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey (ITC-4). Researchers collected data from 7,532 individuals between 2002 and 2008, including cpd data, but did not provide statistical results. Menthol smokers smoked 18.7 cpd and nonmenthol smokers smoked 16.5 cpd, A strength of this data set is that the sample size was generally larger than many of the other post- hoc analyses of similar measures and outcomes.

Scales of nicotine ete/midence (e.g., F1W))

The FTND is an aggregate of several measures of dependence including measures of cigarette craving, as well as the previously discussed time to first cigarette and number of cpd smoked. Use of the FTND score may be limited because cpd accounts for 30 percent of the total FTND score, which, as previously discussed, may not be as reliable a measure of nicotine dependence due to the influence of smoking policies and restrictions.

Okuyemi ct al. (2004) analyzed data from 480 African American smokers at an inner-city health center. There was no significant difference in FTND scores* The restriction lo African Americans eliminates racial or ethnic variability, however the majority of smokers were menthol smokers (n=407), leaving only a small number of nonmenthol smokers (n=73).

Collins and Moolchan (2006) analyzed data from telephone interviews with 572 White and African American adolescent smokers in a treatment study. There were no differences in the FTND scores of menthol and nonmenthol smokers. The majority of smokers were menthol smokers (n=531), with no additional racial or ethnic breakdowns by menthol or nonmenthol preference. Generafizabilily may be limited due to the local sample and use of treatment-seekers. The limit to adolescence increases sensitivity to this group, but findings may not generalize to adults.

Muscat et al. (2009) conducted a community-based cross-sectional study (n=525) and compared FIND scores of menthol and nonmenthol smokers. No significant differences existed in either those with a low to medium FTND score or those with a high FTND score. There was good distribution by race or ethnicity across menthol and nonmenthol groups. However, gencralizability may be limited due to the community sample.

Hersey et al. (2010) analyzed data from the cross-sectional 2006 NYTS, a survey of over 27,000 students in grades 6-12 in public and private schools. After controlling for demographic background and the length, frequency, and level of smoking, Hersey concluded that young smokers who smoked menthol cigarettes had significantly higher scores on a scale of nicotine dependence compared with nonmenthol smokers. This study included a large nationally representative population with a high response rate (80.2%) and weighted estimates. Three menthol smoking status definitions were used to model the relationship between menthol cigarette use and nicotine dependence measure to test the robustness of the association. Data were not stratified by race or ethnicity.

FDA's independent analysis of the Altria TKS data showed significantly h ighcr nicotine dependence scores for FIND (p=0.0437) for menthol smokers using an ordinal response model adjusting for cpd, number of years smoked, total puff volume, and SES or demographic characteristics. In FDA's analysis, tar delivery content (TDC) category was not included in the statistical model. FDA did not want to include this in its model because models with TDC assume that a menthol user would necessarily switch to a nonmenthol brand in the same TDC if menthol brands were no longer available.

As part of the secondary data analyses conducted in 2010 that were not peer-reviewed, two analyses used scales geared toward youth. Nonnemakcr analyzed a school-based study of students 12-18 years old that collected longitudinal cohort data once a year for three years. The Nonnemaker secondary data analysis used an aggregate of four measures:

1)      The average score tor the response to two survey questions: "How soon after you wake up do you usually smoke your first cigarette on weekdays?" and "How soon after you wake up do you usually smoke your first cigarette during the weekend?"

2)      The score for responses to the survey question "If you are sick with a bad cold or sore throat, do you smoke cigarettes?"

3)      The score for the response to the survey question "How true is this statement for you? When I go without a smoke for a few hours, I experience cravings?"

4)      The score for response to the survey question "How true is this statement for you? T sometimes have strong cravings for cigarettes where it feels like Tin in the grip of a force that J can't control?"

Nonnemaker found that middle and high school students who initiated to menthol cigarettes reported higher dependence at the third yearly assessment compared to those who initiated to nonmenthol cigarettes (consistent with students who were more likely to be a daily smoker). Nonnemaker also found that those who switched from menthol to nonmenthol reported a higher level of dependence than those who smoked nonmenthol across the yearly assessments, in this study the majority of menthol smokers were White. Although this analysis pulled from a large sample, this study did not control for socioeconomic status, and point estimates for the other covariates in the model were somewhat implausible due to the small sample size (e.g., the odds ratio for becoming an established smoker for African Americans was 0.23), In addition, researchers included youth who reported initiation in the final wave in an expanded analysis in order to increase sample size, even though these smokers are not followed for smoking progression or menthol use change over time.

The Hcrsey analysis is a second non-pecr-reviewed secondary data analysis that used a dependence scale geared toward youth. Using data from'a Legacy for Health-supported national survey of 5511 youth, which included responses to the Nicotine Dependence Scale for Adolescents, Hersey found that, among youth who smoked for less than one year, smoking menthol cigarettes was associated with significantly higher nicotine dependence. Data did not appear to be stratified by race or ethnicity.

Craving

Wacko wski & Deinevo (2007) examined rates of menthol smoking and measures of nicotine dependence among 1345 current established smokers in grades 9-12 who participated in the                           �JJ

2004 NYTS, a nationally representative survey of public and private school students, Logistic regression was used to generate an adjusted odds ratio for menthol smoking for four measures of nicotine dependence, controlling for demographic characteristics and smoking patterns. Approximately 46 percent of current established cigarette smokers in the study were menthol smokers. Menthol smokers had 2.6 and 1.6 greater odds than nonmenthol smokers for reporting that they could go for less than one hour before feeling like they needed a cigarette and that they experienced cravings after not smoking for a while, respectively. This study found that high school menthol smokers were more likely lo report symptoms of dependence compared to high school nonmenthol smokers, even when controlling for race, age, and cigarette consumption. The responses lo one question (how long before needing a cigarette) had a strong association with menthol use. Although not specifically TTFC, this question resembles this measure. When considering this NYTS question to be a proxy for the "time to first cigarette" question, the results of this study are consistent with previous studies that found adult menthol smokers were more likely to have their first cigarette within a shorter time period than nonmenthol smokers (Ahijevych & Parsley, 1999; Okuyemi el al., 2003; Collins and Moolchan, 2006).

Hersey et al. (2010) analyzed data from the cross-sectional 2006 NYTS, a survey of over 27,000 students in grades 6-12 in public and private schools that garnered a response rate 80.2 percent in a three stage cluster sample design that oversainpted African American, Hispanic, and Asian American students .After controlling for demographic background and the length, frequency, and level of smoking, the odds of needing a cigarette within one hour after smoking was greater in menthol smokers than nonmenthol smokers in new youth smokers and in established youth smokers. The need for a cigarette within one hour alter smoking was significantly associated with being a likely menthol smoker in both the youth smoker and established youth smoker groups (86% and 106% more likely, respectively). This large, nationally representative sample used two menthol smoking status definitions (including self-description as a menthol smoker and reporting of brand) to model the relationship between menthol cigarette use and nicotine dependence in order to test the robustness of the association, hi addition, data were not stratified by race or ethnicity.

Night waking to smoke

Night waking to smoke has emerged as a reliable indicator of nicotine dependence. Tt is strongly associated with several measures associated with nicotine dependence, including TTFC (Bover et al., 2008) and risk for relapse to smoking (Scharf et al., 2008; Foulds et al., 2006). Bover el al. (2008) examined data from 2,312 cigarette smokers who sought treatment at a specialist tobacco dependence clinic. Waking at night to smoke was reported as a "yes" or "no," with no information about the number of wakings. Significantly more menthol smokers (58%) reported waking at night to smoke as compared to nonmenthol smokers (45%). This was a large study, but generalizability may be limited due to the treatment-seeking sample.

Gandhi et al. (2009) conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 1,688 patients who attempted to quit smoking. Waking at night to smoke was reported as a "yes" or "no," with no information about the number of wakings. Significantly more menthol smokers (553%) reported waking at night to smoke as compared to nonmenthol smokers (44.9%). As above, this was a large study, but generalizability may be limited due to the treatment-seeking sample.

Conclusion

In all peer-reviewed articles, researchers collected data through self-report. Although this could be associated with recall bias or misclassification, self-report is the standard of this research field and not considered detrimental to the study results. The data do not support the claim that a substantial number of adult respondents intentionally under-report tobacco use (Everhart et al, 2009; Yeager & Krosnick, 2010). Furthermore, as noted by Caraballo et al. (2011), although evidence exists that there is some self-report bias in reporting menthol or nonmenthol cigarette use, especially among adolescents, this is not necessarily problematic since it is likely that this type of bias is fairly constant over time.

Cpd and FTND, two measures that have historically been used to assess nicotine dependence, find no consistent effect of menthol. Three studies failed to find any differences in cpd (Okulemi el al., 2003; Okuyemi et al., 2004; Collins and Moolchan, 2006), two studies found that menthol sraokers smoked fewer cpd (Fletcher ct al-, 2006; Fagan et al., 2010), and one study found mixed results that varied by racial/ethnic group (Gandhi ct al, 2009). Three studies failed to find any differences in FTND score (Okuyemi et al., 2004; Collins and Moolchan, 2006; Muscat et al., 2009) and one study found that menthol smokers scored higher than nonmenthol smokers (FDA analysis of Atria TES). However, as previously discussed, there are questions concerning the applicability of cpd and FTND measures to the current smoking situation in adults. There is even greater concern when applied to youth, as they smoke fewer cigarettes than established adult smokers and have greater social limitations on when/where they can smoke. Tn contrast there is consistent evidence that menthol smokers are more likely to smoke their first cigarette within 5 min of waking (Fagan et al., 2010; Collins and Moolchan et al, 2006; Bovcr ct al., 2008; FDA analysis of Altria TES; Okuyemi et al., 2003; Hyland and Kasza secondary data analysis), indicating more severe dependence. Those studies that failed to find a difference in TTFC collapse the fastest timeframes, with either smoking within ten minutes (Hyland et al., 2992) or smoking within 30 minutes (Muscat et al, 2009; Lawrence el ah, 2010; Muscat secondary data analysis) as their shortest option. As with TTFC, other measures of dependence consistently indicate that menthol smokers are more dependent as compared to nonmenthol smokers. This includes studies that use non-FTND scales of dependence (Hersey ct al., 2010; Nonnemaker secondary data analysis; Hersey secondary data analysis), as well as measures of craving (Wachowski and Delnevo, 2007; Hersey et al, 2010) and waking at night to smoke (Bover et al., 2008; Gandhi et al., 2009). These studies consistently found that menthol smokers were more dependent. Based on the findings of TTFC, non-FTND scales of dependence, craving measures, and waking at night to smoke, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with increased dependence.

Data indicate thai menthol is not associated with a higher exposure to tobacco smoke carcinogens, but the findings on nicotine dependence are inconclusive. Menthol may not be more hazardous than other cigarette formulations for most smokers, although if carirai be ruled out at this time that some menthol smokers are possibiy al increased risk for lung cancer because of selective inhibition of UDP-qlucuronosyl transferase enzymes._______

H.     Cessation

Quitting smoking, even at later ages, can result in a significant reduction in disease risk and years of life lost (Doll et al., 2004). Therefore, any impact of menthol in cigarettes on smoking cessation has the potential to have a substantial impact on public health. This section evaluated the science comparing cessation success in menthol smokers and nonmenthol smokers. Articles that assessed differences in intention to quit, feelings regarding the likelihood of being able to quit, or the number of quit attempts without reference to cessation success are not a direct assessment of cessation and are not included. Additionally, studies of only former smokers or only current smokers are not included, as there is no relative measure of cessation success.

Cohort studies

Hyland ct al. (2002) conducted a large community-based cohort study to evaluate the association between menthol use and smoking cessation using data collected in the COMMIT study. The COMMIT study was a randomized community-based intervention trial identified by telephone survey for smoking cessation in 11 matched pairs of communities. The study population included 13,268 current smokers (25-64 years old) at baseline (1988). Researchers collected self- reported menthol cigarette use by brand type at baseline. The cessation outcome was defined as no smoking in the last six months. The study indicated that 24 percent of the overall population smoked menthol cigarettes (23% Whites and 57% African Americans). Baseline menthol cigarette use was not associated with quitting in 1993 (RR (95% CI): J (0.90-1. J. 1)) in overall and race or ethnicity subgroups. This longitudinal study had a large community-based cohort sample with a strong definition of smoking cessation (six months abstinence at five years). The analysis was adjusted for demographics, nicotine dependence (e.g., TTFC)� an(j smoking/quitting history. Since dependence may be an intermediate variable affecting cessation success, it is possible that the analyses were over-adjusted, which may result in a dilution of an association. In addition, there was a high loss to follow-up rate over five years (34% from baseline 1988 to 1993).

Pletcher et al. (2006) evaluated the associations between menthol cigarette use and smoking cessation behavior, coronary calcification, and changes in pulmonary function test among 1,544 current smokers who were participants in CARDTA. CARDIA is a population-based cohort study of risk factors for coronary artery diseases among healthy 18-30 years old African Americans and Whites. Smoking cessation behavior (including current smoking status, recent quit attempts, and cessation if recent quit attempt), sustained smoking cessation, and documented relapse were

collected. Sustained smoking cessation was defined as no current smoking in the past two times examined. After adjusting for demographic and social factors, menthol smokers had statistically significant increased risk of relapse (OR (95% CI): 1.89 (1.17-3.05), p=0.009) as compared to nonmenthol smokers. Researchers identified a trend toward lower cessation in menthol smokers, however this did not reach statistical significance (OR (95% CI): 0.71 (0.49-1.02), p=0,06). The statistical analyses were robust, with repeated measures tor outcomes such as quit attempts and cessation after quit attempts and longitudinal assessment for sustained smoking cessation. This large study had long-term follow up, and menthol status was collected at multiple time points. The sample population was diverse, though not nationally representative. Generalizability may be limited since the study included only young African American and White adults 18-30 years old at entry (mean age: 25 years). Statistical power was limited in subgroup analysis (e.g., White menthol smokers, African American nonmenthol smokers).

Blot et al. (2011) conducted a nested case-control study among 440 incident lung cancer cases and 2,213 controls enrolled in the Southern Community Cohort Study between 2002 and 2009. Researchers prospectively determined quitting smoking through computation of quit rates from the follow-up interviews for patients who were current smokers at entry into the cohort. Thus, a quitter was defined as a former smoker, but there was no measure of duration of quitting. After adjusting for demographic variables, there was no difference in the prevalence of having quit smoking between menthol and nonmenthol smoking African Americans (OR (95% CI); 1.03 (0.96-1.11)). However, among Whites, menthol smokers were more likely to have quit as compared to their nonmenthol-smoking counterparts (OR(95% CI): 1.55 (1.41-1.70)).' Although there was a reasonable follow up period of over four years, full follow up was Jacking for about 40 percent of the subjects. Cessation was biochemically verified via assessment of serum cotinine levels. Although multiple sites were used, generalizability may be limited since the sample was not nationally representative.

Okuyemi et al. (2003) evaluated the association between menthol cigarette smoking and cessation

using data collected for a randomized clinical trial that assessed the efficacy of the medication

bupropion-SR (treated for seven weeks) for smoking cessation. The study consisted of 600

African American smokers enrolled in an inner-city health center (> 18 years, > 10 cpd) (471

menthol and 129 nonmenthol smokers). Compared to nonmenthol smokers, menthol smokers

were less likely to be abstinent at six weeks (41.5% and 28.3%, respectively, p=0.006). However,

the seven-day point prevalence abstinence rates at six weeks was not different between menthol

and nonmenthol smokers who received placebo (20.5% for menthol vs. 23.3% for nonmenthol,

p=0.63). Among the treatment group, menthol smokers had significantly lower abstinence rates

than nonmenthol smokers at six weeks (362% vs. 60.3%, p<0.01). Thus it appears that the

menthol smokers did not get the same benefit from the medication as the nonmenthol smokers

did. The association between smoking cessation and menthol also differed by age. Among

smokers 49 years old or younger, 24.9 percent of the menthol smokers were abstinent compared

to 44.4 percent for nonmenthol smokers (p<0.01) but no difference was seen in smokers 50 years

old or over. Nonmenthol smokers were twice as likely to quit smoking as menthol smokers (OR

(95% CI): 2 (1.03-3.95)) among smokers who were 49 years old or younger at six weeks, but not

in smokers who were 50 years old or over after controlling for treatment. The age-specific

logistic regression results did not explicitly mention which factors were controlled. Tn the

methods section, the author mentioned treatment was controlled in logistic regressions but it is                          go

Using the same dataset as Okuyemi et al. (2003), Harris et al. (2004) analyzed the predictors of seven-day cessation in a clinical trial cohort among 600 African Americans who randomly received the cessation medication bupropion SK or placebo for seven weeks and were followed for 27 weeks. Self-reported menthol use was one of the 21 baseline variables examined for the prediction of smoking cessation. The study outcome was biochemically-confirmed self-reported seven-day point prevalence abstinence at week seven, the end of the treatment phase. The study indicated that menthol smokers were less likely to quit smoking after 7 weeks of treatment compared to nonmcnthol smokers (28.3% vs. 41.5%, p~0.0062) using a Chi square test (unadjusted); the effect was not present when researchers adjusted the analysis for demographic factors and factors related to dependence. Since dependence may be an intermediate variable affecting cessation success, it is possible that the analyses were over-adjusted, which resulted in a dilution of the association.Researchers used biochemical verification of self-reported cessation outcomes. Gcncraiizability may be limited since the sample consisted of those seeking treatment and was not nationally representative.

Gandhi et al (2009) evaluated the relationship between menthol cigarette smoking and short-term (4 weeks) and long-term (6 months) smoking cessation among 1,688 patients attending a tobacco treatment clinic in New Jersey. The outcome was a biochemically-verified seven-day point prevalence abstinence rate. The study demonstrated that African American and Latino menthol smokers had significantly lower odds of quitting (OR (95% CI): 0.32 (0.16-0.62) for African Americans; 0.43 (0.1-0.9) for Latinos) as compared to their nonmenthol counterparts at four weeks of follow-up. Researchers observed a similar trend at the six-month follow-up. No significant differences existed in the cessation rates of White menthol and nonmenthol smokers. Researchers adjusted analyses for demographic and dependence variables (e.g., TTFC, waking at night to smoke). Since dependence may be an intermediate variable affecting cessation success, it is possible that the analyses were over-adjusted, which may result in a dilution of association(s). Although this was a large study, there was a high loss to follow up at six months (approximately 42%). Since all those who were lost were included as cessation failures (i.e. still smoking), overall quit rates may be underestimated. Although seven-day point prevalence was biochemically verified, these data were incomplete or not clearly described for all subjects; half of the sample was followed up in person (carbon monoxide verification) but half were followed up via phone contact (no carbon monoxide verification). Generalizability may be limited since the sample consisted of those seeking treatment and was not nationally representative.

Foulds et al. (2006) evaluated factors associated with successful quitting using a sample of 1,021 patients at a free tobacco treatment clinic. Researchers evaluated abstinence at four-week and six-month follow-ups, and biochemically verified self-reported cessation. At the four-week follow up, data showed a trend toward menthol smokers having worse cessation outcomes, however this failed to reach significance (p=0.053). No differences existed at the six-month follow up. Analyses were adjusted for treatment, but other adjustments were unclear, and they may have been overadjusted (e.g., adjusted for dependence variables). This large, longitudinal study had a sample that mimics the U.S. population, however

Murray et al. (2007) investigated the health effect of menthol cigarette smoking among 5887 smokers 35-60 years old with mild to moderate airway obstruction who were selected to participate in a smoking cessation program and were followed for 11 years using the data from the Lung Health Study, In addition to disease-specific mortality, the outcomes included smoking cessation assessments that included the percentages of sustained quitters, of intermittent smokers and of continued smokers. Researchers assessed self-reported menthol cigarette use at baseline and annual follow-up visits for five years. The study indicated no significant difference existed between menthol use and the percentage of quitters during five years of follow-up, after controlling for age, sex, baseline cpd, F1W1% predicted, randomization group assignment, race, and years of education. Although this large clinical trial cohort study had a long follow up period (14 years), the researchers maintained an excellent follow-up rate (94% at five years and 83% 11 years after enrollment). Menthol preference was assessed annually for five years, The smoking cessation definition was fairly strict: sustained quitters were defined as those who were biochemically-confirmed quitters at five annual visits and who recalled no month in which they smoked more than one cpd at any annual visit. Although this was a national survey, the general inability may be limited due to an under representation of African Americans and due to the inclusion solely of smokers with mild or moderate airway obstruction who received smoking cessation treatment.

Cropsey et al. (2009) analyzed the relationship between race, menthol cigarette use, and smoking cessation rates using data from a smoking cessation intervention trial among 233 female prisoner smokers (> 18 years old). This 12-month clinical trial cohort assessed cigarette type (menthol or nonmcnthol) after the subjects entered the intervention. Researchers verified outcomes using seven-day point prevalence abstinence at multiple time points. Menthol cigarette use was not associated with differences in smoking cessation rates. This is a small study of women only, with a very small number of White menthol smokers (approximately 6%). Cessation was biochemically verified. Menthol use was only assessed while in prison, however use patterns may have changed (e.g., differences in brand availability). Despite being a controlled sample, there was a high loss to follow-up. Any gcneralizability potential is limited.

Cross-Sectional Studies

Fu et al. (2008) conducted a cross-sectional survey to evaluate the association between menthol cigarette use and smoking cessation among 1,343 older smokers involved in an aided quit attempt. They used data from a multi-center randomized clinical smoking cessation trial that evaluated the effectiveness of phone call intervention versus usual care. Self-reported menthol use was assessed at the six-month survey post randomization to treatment group. The outcome was self-reported seven-day point prevalence smoking abstinence. The study indicated that smoking menthol cigarettes was not associated with smoking cessation among these older smokers (OR (95% CT): 1.31 (0.95-L82)). Analyses were adjusted for demographic variables, test site, and TTFC, Since dependence may be an intermediate variable affecting cessation, it is possible that the analyses were over-adjusted. Cessation was also self-reported with no biochemical verification. There was a low response rate at the six-month follow up survey, with

a loss of 25 percent. Generalizability may be limited since the sample was composed of those seeking treatment, mostly older males (77% > 50 years old), and not nationally representative.

Muscat et al. (2002) conducted a cross-sectional study to analyze the associations between smoking status and menthol cigarette use among 19,545 current and former African American and White smokers (3,005 menthol and 16,540 nonmcnthol) using data collected in a case-control study designed for characterizing tobacco-related cancers. The study was conducted in several hospitals in New York, Pennsylvania, and the District of Columbia between 1981 and 1999. Menthol status was self-reported based on last brand cigarette smoked. The primary outcome was self-reported smoking status (current vs. quit), which may be subject to misclassification. Menthol smoking was not associated with current versus quitting status (prevalence odds ratio (95% CI): 1.1 (0.8-1.4) in African Americans and 1.1 (1.0-1.3) in VVhites).The odds ratios appear to have been rounded to the nearest tenth, which makes some of the findings difficult to interpret Interpretation of some study results was questionable. For example, the authors stated that smokers of menthol cigarettes were significantly more likely to have been former smokers (African Americans), while the data shown in Table 1 indicated that menthol smokers were more likely to be current smokers (70.4% menthol smokers were current smokers vs. 64.3% nonmenthol smokers were current smokers (p < 0.01)). Although (he sample size was reasonable, the study period spanned 18 years. The definition of an ex-smoker (someone who did not smoke at least one cigarette every day for the past 12 months) was weak and may lead to misclassification. Generalizability may be limited since the sample consisted of older, hospitalized patients, and was not nationally representative. More importantly* the utility of the findings of this study arc limited due to sipjficant methodological flaws.

Gundcrscn et al. (2009) analyzed the association between menthol smoking and cessation among a nationally representative sample of adult current and former smokers (n=7,815) using the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (NHTS). Self-reported menthol use was based on the usual brand of cigarettes smoked in the past 12 months for current smokers or 12 months prior to quitting for former smokers. A former smoker was defined as having smoked 100 or more cigarettes in a lifetime but now "not smoking at all." African Americans and Hispanics were combined under a category labeled "non-White". The study indicated that non-White menthol smokers were significantly less likely to have quit smoking compared to nonmenthol smoking counterparts (odds ratio (95% CT): 0.55 (0.43-0.71)). The odds ratios (95% CI) were 0.78 (0.56-1.09) for African Americans and 0.61 (0.39-0.97) for Hispanics. White menthol smokers, in contrast, were more likely to have quit (p<0.05), with an odds ratio of 1.17 (1-1.36).

Stahre ct al. (2010) examined the relationship between menthol smoking, the population quit ratio,

and utilization of smoking cession aid among 6,511 current and 6,774 former smokers who

participated in the 2005 NH1S-CCS. Researchers collected data on the menthol status of the

participants* usual brand. The quit ratio was defined as the total number of former smokers

divided by the total number of ever smokers, whereas quitters were defined as people who

reported quitting within the previous 12 months. The quit ratio for African American menthol

smokers was significantly lower than their nonmenthol counterparts (34% vs. 49%, p < 0.001).

No significant difference was found in other racial groups including Whites, Asian Americans,

American Indian/Alaska Natives and Hispanics. The NH1S sample was large and nationally                          ^

representative. It is unknown whether smoking cessation lasted for a short time (e.g., one day) or                 �j

continued long-term (e.g., months).                                                                                                                  CD

Levy et al. (2011) evaluated data from the 2003 and 2006 2007 CPS-TUS. This large, nationally representative survey included data from 34,260 individuals in the 2003 survey and 31,250 individuals in the 2006-2007 survey. The likelihood of quitting was 3.5% lower for quitting in the past year and 6% lower for quitting in the past 5 years in menthol compared with nonmenthol smokers. Although the CPS-TUS is a nationally representative dataset, there are limitations with this study, including data transformation, and calculation of prevalence differences. Thus, it may be difficult to interpret the data as presented or draw conclusions from this study.

Given the limitations of Levy et al. (2011), FDA performed independent analyses of the 2006/2007 CPS-TUS dataset. FDA assessed data related to cessation among smokers and former smokers who had last smoked less than five years ago. Menthol smokers had a lower prevalence of cessation as compared to nonmenthol smokers for smokers overall (OR - 0.87,95% CI = 0.82-0.93), and among whiles (OR - 0.87,95% CI = 0.80-0.94), but not among African Americans (OR = 0.84,95% CI = 0.65-1.08) or Hispamcs (OR - 0.98,95% CI - 0.74-1.29). The association with lower cessation for menthol smokers was more pronounced among males (OR = 0.83,95% CT = 0.75-0.93) than among females (OR = 0.93,95% CI - 0.85-1.02).

Conclusion

In all studies available for evaluation, the use of or preference for a menthol brand was based solely on self-report. Although this could be associated with misclassification, self-report is the standard of this research field and not considered detrimental to the study results. Furthermore, Caraballo et al. (2011) noted that while evidence exists of some self-report bias in reporting menthol or nonmenthol cigarette use, especially among adolescents, this is not necessarily problematic since it is likely that this type of bias is fairly constant over time.

Of the nine cohort studies reviewed, three studies (Hyland ct al., 2002; Cropsey et al. 2009; Murray et al, 2007) failed to find any differences in the cessation or relapse rates of menthol versus non-menthol smokers. However, one of those studies may have over-adjusted their analyses (Hyland et al,, 2002) and the generalizabilily of another was extremely limited due to the use of prisoners (Cropsey et al., 2009). A fourth study (Blot et al., 2011) found no difference between African American smokers but that White menthol smokers were more likely to have quit. Of the remaining five cohort studies, four found worse cessation outcomes for menthol smokers as compared to their nonmenthol counterparts (Pletcher et al, 2006; Okuycmi et al.,

2003; Harris et al., 2004), and one had a trend towards menthol smokers having worse outcomes (Fouldsetal.,2006).

Of the six reviewed cross sectional studies, two (Fu et al., 2008; Muscat ct al., 2002) failed to find significant differences between menthol and non-menthol smokers. Of these, the utility of one (Muscat et al., 2002) was found to be extremely limited due to severe methodological flaws. Of the remaining four studies, three found that menthol smokers had worse cessation outcomes as compared to their nonmenthol smoking counterparts, while one (Gundersen et al., 2009), found that African-American and Latino menthol smokers had worse cessation outcomes as compared to their nonmenthol smoking counterparts while the reverse was true for White smokers.

Several of the studies that found no significant association between menthol and cessation success                  �nj

may have overadjusted their analyses by including adjustments for dependence factors such as                           co

TTFC. Since dependence may be an intermediate factor impacting cessation success, it may not be appropriate to control for the level of dependence. This is consistent with the observation that menthol smokers appear to be more nicotine dependent as compared to nonmenthol smokers. Furthermore, the data regarding African American menthol smokers are fairly consistent; they are less likely to be successful in quitting smoking as compared to their nonmenthol counterparts. Although there is a suggestion that White menthol smokers may have greater quitting success, this is not consistent, even using large nationally representative datasets. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is likely associated with reduced success in smoking cessation, especially among African American menthol smokers.

Randomized Controlled Trial

African American smokers enrolled in a clinical trial that

assessed the efficacy of sustained-release bupropion for smoking cessation. Menthol (n = 471) and non-menthol (n = 129} smokers were compared on smoking-retatad characteristics and abstinence rates at 6 weeks and 6 months.

N=600

African American menthol smokers had lower smoking cessation rates after 6 weeks of treatment with bupropion-SRthan African-American nor menthol smokers, thereby putting menthol smokers at greater risk from the health effects of smoking. Lower overall cessation rates among African Americans menthol smokers may partially explain ettirtic differences in smoking-related disease risks

/.      Disease Risk

Data arc clear that smoking tobacco results in an increased risk of disease for smokers, and research has identified causal links between smoking tobacco and risk for lung cancer, esophageal and oropharyngeal cancers, cardiovascular disease and respiratory outcomes, and many others. As part of FDA's analyses, scientists investigated case studies related to menthol and nonmenthol cigarette smoking and the above specific disease risks to determine if menthol affects disease risk for users.

Lung cancer

Kabatand Hebcrt (1991) conducted a hospital-based, case-control study among current smokers

in eight hospitals located in four U.S. cities. They found no difference in lung cancer risk

between menthol smokers (short-term 1-14 years or long-term >I5 years) and nonmenthol

smokers (males: OR (95% CT) 0.98 (0.70-L38) and 1.14 (0.82-1.59); females, 0.76 (0.53-1.16)                     oi

and 0.82 (0.52-1.28) for menthol > 15 years and menthol 1-14 years respectively). Researchers                     Sj

detected no association in stratified analysis by histologial types of lung cancer after controlling                  �

for cpd, duration of smoking, inhalation, race, education, age, and BMI. This appears to be the first epidemiologic study that evaluated the associations between menthol cigarette use and lung cancer risk. The racial or ethnic composition of this study was comparable to White and African Americans in the general population. Generalizability may be limited due to the relatively low prevalence of menthol use by African American participants as compared to the general African American smoking population. Most of the participants were at least 50 years old, however since lung cancer typically does not occur at younger ages, this is not considered a weakness. There is limited power for stratified analysis by histological type (e.g., large cell carcinoma), and the hospital-based controls may have had conditions potentially related to smoking (including colon and breast cancer), which may reduce an association. Menthol cigarette use status was determined by specifically asking about specific brands of cigarettes, which may reduce the potential for misctassification.

Sidney et al. (1995) conducted a cohort study among 11,761 Northern California Kaiser Perrnancnte Insurers current smokers 30-89 years old who had smoked for at least 20 years. The study found that the prevalence of menthol cigarette use was highest among African American smokers, followed by Asian American and White smokers. Menthol smokers were younger and more likely to be females than nonmenthol smokers. Menthol smokers had a statistically significantly higher lung cancer risk than nonmenthol smokers among men (RR (95% CI): 1.45 (1.03-2.02)), but not among women (0.75 (0.51-1.11)). Relative risks were calculated adjusting for age, sex, race, education, cpd, and duration of smoking; the multivariate model did not adjust for other potential factors, such as family history of lung cancer. After more than eight years of follow up, researchers noted a loss of about 25 percent due to members terminating the insurance program which may lead to selection bias. Generalizability may be limited since the difference was only seen in men, and the participant pool was limited to Northern California Kaiser Permanente Insurerers customers only, a pool that was not nationally representative.

Carpenter et al. (1999) examined the association between menthol cigarette use and lung cancer using data from a population based case-control study that evaluated genetic markers for lung cancer risk in Los Angeles County, California. The subjects were current and former smokers 40-84 years old. The study found no difference in lung cancer risk between menthol and nonmenthol smokers (OR(95% CI): 1.04 (0.62,1.75)). The study also found no difference in lung cancer risk between menthol smokers and nonmenthol smokers by race. The analysis adjusted for matching factors, total pack-years, and years since quitting. Due to the low response rate of controls (731:3193) the remaining controls may not be representative of the general population from which the cases were drawn. Generalizability is limited, as the African American sample reported smoking menthol cigarettes al rates lower than the national estimate.

Brooks et al. (2003) conducted a hospital-based case-control study using data collected in the

Slone Epidemiology Center Case-Control Surveillance Study in the eastern United Stales. I nc

analysis was restricted to subjects 40-74 years old who had smoked for at least 20 years, had

no history of cancer, and were interviewed between 1981 and 2000. Analyses were adjusted

for demographic factors and smoke-related factors (e.g., duration of smoking, cpd, years since

quitting, proportion of years smoking filtered cigarettes, etc.), The study found no difference in

lung cancer risk between long-term menthol smokers and nonmenthol smokers (OR (95% CI):

0.97 (0.70-J .34)). Risks also did not differ by race or sex. Menthol status was characterized

by brand and dose of exposure (i.e. duration of menthol cigarette use). Due to differences in                        q

how cases and controls were identified, researchers adjusted the data for the time of interview                      ^
pgNbr=834
to account for bias. The study was restricted to long-term smokers to minimize the potential for selection bias for controls, however this may limit generalizability. A significant amount of missing data makes establishing exposures difficult; brand information could be identified in 60 percent of total duration of smoking. Most lung cancer patients were discovered at a time when menthol cigarettes were not popular so menthol status was not known for many patients. The authors assumed these cases smoked nonmenthol cigarettes. However, this may result in misclassification of the exposure and bias the estimates. A possible selection bias may exist in cases since the study included lung cancer cases hi patients who were diagnosed with lung cancer 12 months before their current admission instead of only newly diagnosed patients. Thus, the cases may include long-time survivors who may not have general characteristics for all lung cancer patients. The controls were hospitalized for diseases determined to be unrelated to cigarette smoking, however diagnoses could include breast and colon cancers, which may be related to smoking. Data collection was limited to the brand most recently smoked (or currently smoking) and also the brand reportedly smoked the longest. Dala from both questions were only obtained from 17 percent of the subjects, so researchers included subjects who could provide brand information for at least 60 percent of the total duration of smoking.

Slellman et a), (2003) reported results from a hospital-based, case-control study that was conducted between 1984 and 1998. The study found no associations between menthol cigarette use status and lung cancer risk among current smokers for white males (OR (95% CI): 0.83 (0.63-1.09)), African American males (1.34 (0.79-2.29)), white females (0.6 J (0.44-1.06)), and African American females (0.79 (0,41-1.54)). Odds ratios were adjusted for age at diagnosis, pack-years of smoking, education years, and BMI, The study did not report odds ratios for current smokers overall, by sex, or by race. The hospital-based controls may have had conditions related to smoking that would reduce the association. Generalizability is limited, as suhjects were hospitalized and not nationally representative.

Murray ct al. (2007) investigated the health effects of menthol cigarette smoking among 5,887 adult smokers 35-60 years old with mild to moderate airway obstruction who participated in a smoking cessation program as part of the Lung Health Study. This long-term cohort study had annual assessments for five years. Menthol cigarette use was not significantly associated with mortality caused by coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer (hazard ratio (95% CI):0.96 (0.70-1.32)), and any causes during 14 years of follow-up. Researchers adjusted estimates for age, sex, race, years of education, cpd, and predicted respiratory volume (FEV1% predicted), and randomization group assignment. Menthol status was checked annually. Generalizability may be limited as the sample was not nationally representative.

Etzel et al. (2008) analyzed results from a case-control study of African American

smokers in the Houston area to identify lung cancer risk factors to be included in a lung

cancer risk prediction model. The study did not find statistically significant differences in

lung cancer risk between menthol and nonmenthol smokers in the case-control data,

although the risk estimates trended toward being lower for current smokers (OR 0.69

(0.46-1.03)) and ever smokers (0.81 (0.60-1.09)), but not for former smokers 0.99 (0.62-

1.56)). Menthol cigarette use was not retained in the final multivariablc epidemiologic

risk model for African Americans. The sample is not nationally representative. This novel

model of lung cancer risk prevention has not yet been validated by others in the field.                                   q,

Blot et al (2011) conducted a nested case-control study among 440 incident lung cancer cases and 2,213 controls enrolled in the Southern Community Cohort Study between 2002 and 2009. Researchers matched cases and controls on age, sex, and race, and they adjusted estimates for pack-years of smoking, educational attainment, household income, use of other tobacco products, health insurance coverage, close family history of lung cancer, and BMI. The risk of lung cancer incidence for both current smokers and former smokers was substantially higher than for nonsmokcrs. In a multivariate analysis adjusted for pack-yeai*s of smoking, there was a statistically significant association between menthol smoking and lower lung cancer risks for incidence (OR 0.65 (0.47-0.90)) and mortality (IIR 0.69 (0.49-0,95)) among current menthol smokers compared to current nonmenthol smokers. The study also found statistically significant lower incidence risks tor menthol smoking among current female smokers (OR 0.43 (0.24-0.75)) and current African American smokers (OR 0.52 (0.34-0.78), but not among current male smokers (OR 0.77 (0.49-1.23)) and current White smokers (OR 0.84 (0.43-1.64).

Among a set of secondary data analyses conducted in 2010 that have not been peer-reviewed, Muscat analyzed data from a community cross-sectional study of 525 African American and White smokers. The analysis found a statistically significant lower risk of lung cancer among current menthol smokers 50 years old and over (OR 0.76, p-valuc=0.049). There was a trend toward an association between menthol smoking slalus and lower risk of lung cancer among all current smokers (OR 0.82, p-valuc=0.110).

Tn addition to peer-reviewed articles and secondary data analyses, FDA also evaluated the association between menthol smoking and disease risk using data from the 1987 National Health Interview Survey that was linked to the National Death Index tor mortality follow-up. Mortality data were available for approximately 5,000 participants who were current menthol and nonmenthol smokers at the time of interview. FDA estimated mortality hazard ratios for menthol smokers compared to nonmenthol smokers, adjusting for demographic and smoking characteristics. The hazard ratio for lung cancer mortality for menthol smokers overall was 0.69 (95% CI; 0.45-1.06). The hazard ratio for lung cancer mortality for menthol smokers 50 years old and over was 0.59 (95% CI = 0.36-0.96). No differences existed in overall mortality from all causes of death, other than lung cancer, for menthol and nonmenthol smokers.

In an industry supported study, Lee (2011) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of eight epidemiological studies examining the relationship between lung cancer risk and menthol smoking. The meta-analysis included the seven articles previously discussed in this section as well as a conference abstract (Jockel, Pohlabeln, and Jahn, 2004) that was conducted in Germany and for which the results have only been reported in English in a journal abstract. The overall adjusted relative risk estimate for menthol smoking compared to nonmenthol smoking from the meta-analysis was 0.93 (95% CI 0.84-1.02, n=8). A statistically significant lower risk was observed in females (RR 0.80,0.67-0.95, n=5 studies) and in studies published since 2001 (0.88,0.77-0,99, n=5 studies). No difference in risk was observed in males (1.01,0.84-1.22, n^5 studies) or in studies published between 1991 and 2000 (1.00,0.86-1.15, n=3). Estimates of relative risk for menthol smokers compared to nonmenthol smokers trended toward being lower for whites (0.87,0.75-1.03, n=4) and African Americans (0.90,0.73-1. 10, n=4 studies), but the differences failed to reach                                    ^

Oropharyngeal cancer

Kabatand Hebert (1994) conducted a hospital-based, case-control study of tobacco-related cancers among current smokers in eight hospitals in four U.S. cities. This was a moderately sized study, with 194 male and 82 female newly diagnosed oropharyngeal cancer cases, and 845 male and 411 female controls. After adjusting for demographic factors, as well as cpd, BMI, alcohol intake, filtered or un filtered cigarette use, and duration of smoking, they found no association between menthol cigarette use and oropharyngeal cancer risk (OR (95% CI): 0.9 (0.5-1.6)) for male menthol smokers and 0.7 (0.5-1.7) tor females menthol smokers compared to nonmenthol smokers. Although the authors stated that menthol cigarette use was positively associated with pharynx cancer in males 1.7 (0,8-3.4), the difference was not statistically significant. Menthol use was self-reported. The control cases were hospitalized with conditions bought not to be related to smoking, however it included cancers that could be smoking-rela.ed (e.g., breast cancer, colon cancer). The sample size in subgroups was small, with limited power. Generali/ability may be limited since the sample was not nationally representative and limited lo hospitalized patients.

Kwpfiageal cancer

In a letter to the editor, Hebert and Rabat (1988) reported results of an analysis of case-control study data of esophageal cancer and found no effect of menthol smoking on esophageal cancer risk. The risks for esophageal cancer for men and women who smoked menthol cigarettes for 10 years or more versus nonmenthol smokers were not significantly different (men = OR (95% CI): 0.70 (0.29-1.73); women - OR (95% CI): 1 -53 (0.61-3.86)). This is a relatively small study, with 96 female and 216 male eases and 157 female and 305 male controls. It is not clear from the letter if the authors controlled for factors such as alcohol consumption and socioeconomic status in the analysis.

In a follow-up to the 1988 letter to the editor, Hebert and Kabat (1989) again sought to investigate the relationship between menthol cigarette smoking and esophageal cancer. They analyzed a larger datasct from 20 hospitals in nine U.S. cities in the American Health Foundation Comprehensive Tobacco Questionnaire, a large, matched, case-control study. This time, investigators found a trend toward reduced risk (p=0.08) among male menthol smokers (<10 yrs) versus male never smokers (OR (95% Ci): 0.50 (0.23-1.07)), but this trend failed to reach significance. There was no increased risk for those who had been menthol smokers for more than 10 years. Logistic analysis for females showed a non-statistically significant trend toward increased risk for those who had been menthol smokers for more than 10 years (OR (95% CI: 2.3 (0.93-5.720) (rH).07)). In this investigation, researchers included major risk factors for esophageal cancer tor analysis, such as lifetime exposure to tobacco (end, menthol vs. nonmenthol) and alcohol (duration, amount). Statistical analysis included adjustment for demographic factors.

Multiple Cancers

Freidrnan et al. (1998) conducted a cohort study among 5,770 men and 5,990 women 30-89                          ^

years old who were enrolled in Kaiser Permanente health insurance from 1979-1985 in Northern                   ^

California, with follow-up through 1994. The subjects had each smoked for at least 20 years. The                  O
pgNbr=837
study examined relative risks for upper aerodigestive cancer, pancreatic cancer, renal adenocarcinoma, other urinary tract cancer, uterine cervical cancer, and all of these cancers combined among menthol smokers compared to nonmenthoi smokers. Analyses were controlled for race and age. There were no significant differences, although the relative risks for menthol smoking for seven of the nine estimates (five cancer sites by sex) trended toward being reduced. The overall relative risk for all smoking-rclated cancers was not significantly different between male menthol and nonmenthoi smokers (0.76 with 95% CI 0.52-1.11) or female menthol and nonmenthoi smokers (0.79 with 95% CI 0.53-1.18). The overall relative risk for both sexes combined was not presented; it is not clear if mis result would have shown a statistically significant lower risk of these cancers for menthol smokers compared to nonmenthoi smokers.

Among a set of secondary data analyses conducted in 2010 that have not been pccr-revicwed, Stcllman and Neugut produced a follow-up to their 2003 study by analyzing data on cancer risk from the American Health Foundation hospital-based, multi-center, case-control study (3,728 cases and 4,888 controls). The researchers estimated the odds ratios for the association between menthol smoking and cancer risk of the oral cavity, larynx, lung, esophagus, and bladder and among the overall population and in subgroups stratified by sex, controlling for age, race, educational attainment, BM1, and pack-years of smoking. Nine of the 10 odds ratios for the cancers by sex were less than 1.0 and the tenth, lung cancer among males, was 1.0, although the differences were not statistically significant. The odds ratio for lung cancer for female menthol smokers versus female nonmenthoi smokers was 0.8 (95% CI 0.6-1.0). Since the authors did not report odds ratios to the nearest hundredth, it is not possible to determine how close this result was to statistical significance. That is, if the 1.0 was a result of rounding up, the odds ratio would reach significance, indicating reduced lung cancer risk for female menthol smokers, but if it was a result of rounding down, it would indicate overlapping data and therefore no significant differences.

MtdUple non-cancer diseases

Plctcher et al. (2006) evaluated the associations between menthol cigarette use, coronary calcification and changes in pulmonary function test among 1,544 current smokers who were participants in CARD1A. CARD! A is a population-based longitudinal cohort study of risk factors for coronary arleiy diseases among healthy African Americans and Whites 18-30 years old. The subjects were followed for 15 years. The study found no difference in the association between menthol or nonmenthoi exposure (in pack-years) and the prevalence of coronary calcification and 10-ycar decline in lung function. This is one of only two studies in this section that assessed menthol use on multiple occasions, finding that menthol status was relatively stable, suggesting little misclassitication. Although the sample was diverse, it was not nationally representative, which may limit generalizability. While this is a large study, sample sizes in certain groups were small (e.g., African American nonmenthoi smokers).

Murray ct at. (2007) examined the associations between menthol cigarette use and health risks

among 5,887 Lung Health Study participants with early signs of obstructive lung impairment.

They conducted analyses of mortality from selected causes and concluded menthol cigarette use

was not significantly associated with mortality caused by coronary heart disease, cardiovascular

disease, and any causes during 14 years of follow-up. Estimates were adjusted for age, sex,                        q,

race, educational attainment, cpd, predicted respiratory volume, and randomization group                            Jjj

assignment. This is a fairly large study with long-term follow up, and researchers assessed                          o
pgNbr=838
menthol use at multiple time points. Generalizabilrty may be limited, as the sample is not nationally representative and limited to people with mild or moderate airway obstruction who participated in a smoking cessation program.

Among a set of secondary data analyses conducted in 2010 that have not been peer-reviewed, HyJand andKas2a analyzed data from the International Tobacco Control Four Country Survey, with data from the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia, Data were collected from 7,532 individuals between 2002 and 2008. JTiis study had a large and nationally representative sample population- Uyland and Kasza used case-control data collected between 2005 and 2010 by RoswellPark Cancer Institute and interview data collected between 1957 and 1965 by Roswcll Park Memorial Institute to analyze the association between menthol smoking and risks of lung cancer and COPD. Adj listed relative risks for lung cancer or COPD trended toward being lower for female menthol smokers (OR 0.48,0,23-1,02) and smokers overall (0,68,0.38-1.22) compared to nonmenthol smokers, however the differences were not statistically significant. No difference was observed between male menthol and male nonmenthol smokers (1.16,0.43-3.10). Analysis of data collected during the 1957-1965 time period indicated no menthohnonmenthol differences for smokers overall (1.15,0.73-1.81) or by sex. Relative risks were adjusted for age, race, and pack-years of smoking.

Other health characteristics

Mendiondo et al. (2010) examined the health characteristics between menthol and nonmenthol smokers using data from the 2005 NHTS-CCS, a large, nationally representative, cross-sectional survey. The study demonstrated that former menthol smokers had slightly higher BMT (OR (95% CI): 1.01(1.00-1.02)) and were more likely to have visited the emergency room due to asthma (OR 2.30:1,04,5,09).

Conclusion

Although menthol or nonmenthol classification and cigarette use data were self-reported and could be associated with misclassification, self-report of this kind of data are the standard of this research field and not considered detrimental to the study results. Furthermore, the data do not support the claim that a substantial number of adult respondents intentionally under-report tobacco use (Evcrhart et al, 2009; Yeager & Krosnick, 2010). Furthermore, as noted hy Carabalb et al. (2011), although there is evidence that there is some self-report bias in reporting menthol^ionmenlhol cigarette use, especially among adolescents, this is not necessarily problematic since it is likely that this type of bias is fairly constant over time,

Eleven studies (Brooks et al, 2003; Carpenter et al., 1999; Etzcl et af, 2008; Freidman et al.,

1998; Hebert and Kabat, 1988; Hcbcrt and Kabat, 1989; Kabat and Hebert, 1991;Kabatand

Hebert, 1994; Murray ct al., 2007; Pletcher et al., 2006; Stellman et al., 2003) failed to find any

significant differences in disease risk between menthol and nonmenthol smokers. One study

found a greater disease risk in some groups (Sidney et al., 1995). Two studies (Blot et al., 2011;

Lee, 2011) suggest that, in some groups, menthol smoking may be associated with lower cancer

risk as compared to nonmenthol smoking. It is possible, but not clear at this time, that this                            ^

association might be related to historical differences in cigarette design features (such as tip                          JJ

ventilation between menthol and nonmenthol cigarettes) or other demographic factors. No                           o

physiological cause for an association between cancer risk and menthol in cigarettes has been                       *�

established. From the available studies, the weight of evidence supports the conclusion that menthol in cigarettes is riot associated with an increase in disease risk to the user.

	The lung cancer risk for long-term smokers of menthol cigarettes was similar to that for smokers of nonmenthol cigarettes(odds ratio= 0,97,95% confidence interval: 0.70,1,34). Odds ratios were also close to 1.0 in separate analyses of male, female, Black, and White subjects. The results of this study do not support the hypothesis that smoking menthol cigarettes increases the risk of iung cancer relative to smoking nonmenthoi cigarettes.

Objective: To examine the plausibility of health claim* for Eclipse, a navel smoking article being marketed by the Rl Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) as potentially reducing the risk of cancer and other diwcttw compared to conventional cigarettes,

Data sources; A company product website (www.aciips9.rjrt.com) summarising scientific studies of various versions of Edipse, arid the published review of those studies by an expert panel converted fay RJR, an independent study comparing the smoke yields of ma{or carcinogens from Eclipse- and two low yield "ultralight-" brands [Now and Carlton], and on analysis of the levels of these compound* in Eclipse ond Premier I'rb predecessor} over time.

Analysis: The overall doses and effects of toxins in the aerosol from Eclipse arc smaller than those from most conventional cigarettes on a per mg basis. However, two tests that compared Eclipse on a per cigarette basis revealed that Eclipse was m or more toxic than an ultralight cigarette. Studies show that consumers smolte Eclipse (lib ihey do cigarettes) at puff volumes and puff frequencies far higher than those used for the Federal Trade Commission (FTQ lest. RJR's test results, which are based on aerosols generated under FTC conditions, may not reflect actual human dosing, since the operating temperature of Eclipse is highly dependent on these puffing parameters. Even under FTC/International Organization Far Standardization (ISO) standard measures, Eclipse smoke carcinogen yields were higher than Now, but similar to Carlton. The yields of carcinogens from Premier and different versions of Eclipse have increased over time. Furthermore, the human studies reviewed by the RJR expert panel do not offer compelling evidence of reduced harm, as they have not been conduded in smokers who have adopted Eclipse.

Conducbm There b as yet unsatisfactory evidence that Eclipso Is less harmful than conventional cigarettes. Eclipse appears to be at least as toxic as some commercially available cigarette brands. Con* miners may be misled by RJR's health claims Into believing that Eclipse is a safer alternative to conventional cigarettes, underscoring the need for regulatory intervention.

In 19%, the KJ ReynoldsTobacco Company (KJR) began test marketing Eclipse, a novel cigarette-like smoking article. Eclipse was the successor to Premier, a similar product that was Introduced in 1988but later withdrawn from test markets a few months later because of what the manufacturer described as poor consumer acceptance.' The withdrawal was associated with considerable opposition from the public health community, which had petitioned the Pood and Drug Administration f FDA) to regulate premier as a drug. Premier and Eclipse differ radically from conventional cigarettes in that they both purportedly heat rather than burn tobacco. This advanced design delivers a nicotine containing aerosol to the user, while ostensibly reducing the delivery of many smoke compounds that contribute to the risk of cancer and other illnesses.

Eclipse was test marketed in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and similar versions of the product were sold In Germany (III.Q), Sweocn (Inside), and Japan (Aii$). Wtulc Eclipse fared better with consumers than Premier, its success was nonetheless limited.' in 1997, RIR introduced a new Eclipse In wMcli the fdter was replaced hy a hollow mouthpiece.1 This redesigned version was launched in the spring of 2000 in the Dallas/Port VWwih area through a website and toll-free ordering number, which were supplemented by retail sales in early 200J,* The national marketing camjuign fur the new Eclipse is distinguished by It s ejrpUrit health claims. Remarking "There's no cigarette like Ectipse", RJR claims that, compared to other brands, Edipse:

�  may present less Tisk of cancer

�  produce It** inflammation in ih* T*�ptr*u>ty system, which suggests a lower risk of chronic bronchitis and possibly even emphysema

WWW.tofcKaecftcaniml.c&m

� may pose less risk to smokers of developing cardiovascular

disease.1

These claims rest on data compiled by the company from a wide range chemical, animal, and human studies conducted on several Eclipse prototypes, which arc summarised on the website.* Some of these studies were performed In house, while others were conducted by contract laboratories or by university researchers working under company grants.

RJR also assembled a panel o/pa/d consulianu to conduct an independent review of the data. This panel included the editor-in-chief of JnhatotiM TftKPftgrjt the journal in which the review was published (as a supplement supported entirely by RIR),' and one of the scientists who had received a grant from the company. The panel chair had also served as the Independent pathologist reviewer of the tissue slides from the rodent inhalation, studies. The editor had Informed one of the authors of this paper that be was going to personally select the peer reviewers of the panel's manuscript (D Gardner, personal communication, February 2000), The panel's conclusions are consistent with RJR's health dUims for Edipse,

Since these claims have not been subjected to an independent review by a regulatory agency, they warrant further investigation to determine whether they are truly justified. Objective analysis of scientific data used to back health claims in tobacca industry marketing is especially Important with

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF ECLIPSE

like its predecessor Premier, Eclipse superficially resembles a conventional filtered cigarette. However, instead of a single coktmn of a tobacco blend capped by a Alter, it contains a series of four functionally discrete sections that work together to generate a nicotine-containing aerosol" (fig 1}.

At the distal end lies a carbon fuel dement that is surrounded by a (ibregiass Insulator, or in some versions, by a piece of paper derived from tobacco. When lit, the fuel element provides tbc energy that vaporises the material in the adjacent aluminium lined chamber, which consists of a mixture of glycerin and shredded papers derived from tobacco in an approximately 50:50 ratio.' The operating temperature of this chamber increases the more vigorously the device is puffed, which Increases the fraction of nicotine thai is vaporised and transferred to the aerosol (fig 2).' Next is a cooling chamber tilled with; another formulation of shredded tobacco papas, where vapours condense to form the aerosol Inhaled by the smoker. The final segment in a cellulose} acetate mouthpiece, which acts as a filter in some versions but is hollow in the currently marketed product. Of the numerous Eclipse prototypes that have been developed, the RJR expert panel review considered testing performed on six of them.* Two of these were never test-marketed in the USA but they may be similar to the Airs version of Eclipse sold to Japan.

TESTS CONDUCTED BY RJR ON ECLIPSE

B> determine whether Eclipse may present less risk for diseases associated with smoking, JUR conducted four main types of comparative tests:

*  smoke composition tests

*  in vitro studies using animal and human cells

�  Inhalation and skin tumour studies in rodents

�  studies with smokers who switched m Eclipse from their usual brand of tobacco burning cigarettes.' *

�GTC 4-09B. GTC 5-014. GTC 5,535, GTC 7-026, GTC 7067, and C3TC 70B8. GTC is on RJR ocronym fw "flrflot tarfflo cigar*!***.

RJR contends the results of these tests indicate that the aerosol from Hdipse generally produces "demonstrably Irss biological activity" than that of conventional tobacco burning cigarettes.9 It is on this basis that the company Justifies its marketing health claims for Eclipse.

The validity of smoke comparison tests with regard to dairas at reduced health risks is questionable because they use the FTC method, which bears little resemblance to human smoking patterns, The results of 32 human smoking studies listed In the 1988 Surgeon General's report indicate that humans tend to take larger puff volumes than the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) smokuig machine and puff at nearly twice the rate (table 1). The results of a recent laboratory study showed that smokers of low yield (* 0.8 mg FTC nicotine) and high yield (0.9-1.2 mg FTC nicotine) cigarette brands had significantly shorter Imerpuff intervals (about 20 seconds) than those of the HFC protocol." Thus, smokers often rake more than one puff per minute, thereby potentially increasing their intake over the FTC yields.

Furthermore, research conducted by HJK has shown that when smoking Eclipse prototypes, human smokers tended ro take larger, more frequent puffs than when they smoked their usual brand of tobacco-burning cigarettes (see below}.'

Greater attention should therefore be placed on biological studies.

Cdipse tirtoke cort�1ituenr yields

HJR compared the Eclipse total particulate matter (TPM) yield under FTC conditions to dut or three different conventional cigarettes: a commercial higher-yield "Ultra light" (Merit Ultralight) and two research cigarettes designated 1R4F and 1R3F, which arc made to resemble a 'low tar" and an "ultra low tar" marketed product, respectively' The Eclipse website provides four pie charts that break down these yields into percentage nicotine, water, glycerin, and "othcc", the fraction that contains the major toxic constituents, or "soot".' Table 2 presents these data (Including "tar") as both percentages and absolute amounts.

Glycerin, which is in itself unlikely to be toxic, makes up a large propoTtioQ (40%) of the Eclipse total particulate matter. The Eclipse percentage seal fraction is three to four times lower than the other three cigarettes. At the same time, however, one Bdipse cigarette produce* the same amount of soot

KJK also compared the FTC yields of 30 specific toxic constituents from these four cigarettes.' * While Eclipse showed reductions in most compounds, the levels of four

(ammonia, formaldehyde, NNK, and 4-arainor#benyl) were statistically the same between Eclipse and 1R5F, and two (acrolein and furfural) were much higher In Eclipse. Carbon monoxide yields from Hdipse have also been high compared to conventional cigarettes/

HJR also provided data on the FTC aerosol levels of 14 major carcinogens to support its claim that Eclipse has "80% less carcinogens" than a "typical" ultralight cigarette (Men Ultralight),' Table 3 lists the levels of five of the most potent compounds analysed (italics), as well as tar, nicotine, and carbon monoxide. With the exception of atrokta. Eclipse produces 64-87% lower levels of these carcinogens than Merit.

An FJK study that examined delivery of smoke particulates using puff parameters similar to those taken by humans (that is, a 56 ml, 2 second puff every 26 seconds) showed lower yields of many smoke constituents other than water and glycerin, compared to cigarettes," However, because the mean puff volume drawn on Eclipse by Wit's volunteer smokers was 67 ml and the interpuff interval was 19.7 seconds,1 both of which are substantially less than maximal test parameters, these findings: are not generalisable,

MOPH study

lb investigate the validity of this reduced carcinogens claim, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MOFH) commissioned art independent analysis of the Eclipse aerosol versus two brands in the ultralight category: Now King Size Hard Pack (RJR; FTC tar < 0.5 rag) and Carlton King Size Soft Pack (Brown 6- WHamsoa- PTC tar 1 rog),t The study was performed by Labstat International Inc of Canada, a certified cigarette testing laboratory that periodically conducts smoke constituent testing for RJR." Two protocols were used: the International Organization for Standardization^0)/FTC method and a more intensive "inaeased" method developed by the MDPH (tattle 4). These are the same settings employed by KIR scientists in a 1996 report comparing Eclipse yields with those of conventional cigarettes."

The Labstat data, shown in table 5, using the ISO/FTC methodology indicate that Eclipse does not appear to have 80% less cancer causing agents ha Its acrosoL Under "Increased" smoking conditions, the yields from Now remained very low while those from Carlton and Eclipse

Comparison of major carcinogen yields from Premier, Edlpn lr and Eclip�e If

Additional data strongly suggest thai the levels of certain carcinogens may have increased from Premier to Eclipse 1, and Again in Edipje II.

Table 6 presents the yields or lour carcinogens for ihe 1988 Premier, the 1996 Eclipse, and the current Edipsc, launched in 2000. These data were collected from a variety of sources, Including a monograph that RJR published on Its testing of

Premier," the company's 1996 report on Eclipse," and the recent tab�at study.11 Similar testing conditions were employed In each of the studies.

levels of Bap increased 775% from fremiti t0 Eclipse I, and Eclipse U levels were 71% greater than Bdipse 1. Similar increases were observed for NWf and NNK (160% and 167% from Eclipse 1 to II, respectively). The differences between Bdipie 1 and II may be caused by the Introduction of a hollow filter In the current product, which may have reduced flluatltm Mid resulted in increased yields of toxic constituents.

IN VITRO STUDIES

These tests showed that the Eclipse condensate was less toxic, usually by a large amount, than that from either research cigarette.

the most mutagenic condensates (rag by mg) were those from the two lowest yielding brands.*

However, the data from two separate neutral red and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assays performed on whole smoke from four Eclipse prototypes and the two research cigarettes Stand in notable contrast to the results obtained with condensate. These data arc presented here In table 7, which is presented as table 8 in the expert panel report.*

The two versions of Gdipse that performed worse than the 1R5F in the neutral red assay were the two that were put Into test markets In the USA, The performance of the other two was about the same as the IR5E In the SCE, the 1996 product (GTC 5-535) did somewhat better than the IR5F, while die current version (GTC 7-026) was indistinguishable from the 1R5F.

Furthermore, the comparisons in these whole smoke assays were based not on the wdght of the aerosols, but rather on the number of clgarettcn needed to generate them for measurement of the end points. While the rng by mg comparisons hi the condensate tests work to the advantage of Bdipse (because the "soot" In its TPM Is diluted by water and glycerin), Eclipse docs not enjoy this artificial advantage in the measure used to score the whole smoke assays. In the latter, the 1H4F exhibits the greatest loxidiy, the current Eclipse is intermediate, and the 1R5F Is the least toxic.

IN VIVO STUDIES

RJR conducted inhalation testing with four Eclipse prototypes in Spxaguc-Dawlcy rats and with one prototype (GTC 5-014, one of the non-marketed versions) in Syrian golden hamslers.�' * Comparison of specific mg for mg doses (0.16, 0.32, and 0.64 ing TPM/Utre for one hour daily, five days a week for 11 weeks) showed that the aerosol from the Eclipse devices produced less histological damage than the smoke from 1R4F cigarettes.

Mouse skin painting studies on four versions af Eclipse were performed using Senear mice. Condensate was administered three times per week for 29 week* In doses of 10,20, or 40 mg per application, while the tests uniformly showed lower tumour production for Eclipse condensate on a mg by mg basis versus the 1K4F cigarette, there were pronounced differences among the various prototypes tested. The current product {GTC 7 026) was associated with the highest level of tumour production. However, the results for this version suggest that it performed better than the 1R4F merely because the lumorlgenlc material in the Eclipse condensate was about threefold less potent. This is shown here In table 8, which is derived from table 11 of the expert panel report.4

When compared within doses. Eclipse produced fewer tumours and fewer rumour bearing mice than the IMF. However, the number of rumours on the mice exposed to Eclipse condensate at 40 rag is intermediate between that of the 1R4F condensate exposed mice at 10 and 20 mg. Tins relationship also holds for the number of animals In each subgroup that developed tumours,

HUMAN SMOKING STUDIES

RItt conducted several studies in human volunteers, including assays of nicotine and carbon monoxide absorption from various versions of Eclipse, and urine mutagenicity tests comparing Eciipse with the subjects' usual cigarette brands.' * In addition, a number of comparative assessments of pathological respiratory changes associated with tobacco use were measured In humans by university based researchers working under company grants.

The volunteers smoked Eclipse more aggressively than the FTC parameters, while ranges and standard deviations have not been reported, the mean puff volume was 67 ml, and the tntcrpuff interval was 19.7 seconds.* The mean total puff volume was 1371 ml, compared to 640 ml for the subjects' usual brands, and only 523 ml by the FTC method.

Nicotine absorption from Edipse wa* similar to that from the subjects' usual brands. This may be because the operating temperature of Hclipsr is highly user dependent (fig 2) and increases with mote vigorous puffing. Nicotine delivery on a per litre basis increases greatly at higher temperatures.* This pattern i$ distinctly different from the effect of changing puffing parameters for conventional cigarettes, for which deUver-

SRJR has only reported (nhdaNon tfudtoi tiling one rodsnt spuctas tor the products Ihai hava ocluofly bwn markelad In fa USA.

ics pcT litre remain similar from one condition to another." This phenomenon may also result in increases in toxic constituent yields at higher puff volumes and rates (and hence, at higher operating temperatures} from Eclipse than would be predicted from a simple increase in total puff volume.

Carbon monoxide absorption varied among the Eclipse prototypes. The 1996 version (GTC 5-535) had an average carboxYhaemoglobla (COHb) boost of 17-21%, while that of ihe current product (GTC 7-026) was 6-8% over that of the subjects' usual brands. An apparent tradeoff for this improvement is the higher delivery of other toxins in this version (table 6) and its poorer performance in toxicity testing (whole smoke and mouse skin painting assays}.

Urine testing showed a reduction of at least 70% in mutagenicity versus the usual brands for all versions of Eclipse tested. However, because the study does not kiendfy the subjects' usual brands, it h not known if they were smoking M flavour, low tax, or ultra tow tar cigarettes before switching to Eclipse. Not does it reveal how many of these cigarettes they had been smoking per day. This information Is relevant to the taterprclation of the testing results in light of die health claims being made for Eclipse, since it Is essentially engineered as an ultrahght-Uke product. Smokers of ultralight cigarettes, who would therefore be most likely to switch to Hdipse, make up only a small percentage of the smoker market," Furthermore, although many consumers tried Hdipse In test marketing, very few actually switched (J Donald deBethizy, personal communication to J Slade). It may have been that those who did switch had been smoking lower yielding brands or were light smokers to begin with, but there is nevertheless no indication that the study subjects selected were likely adopters of Edipse.

The expert panel report also summarises the results to date of five sets of university based studies designed to determine the physiological and biochemical effects of switching from tobacco burning cigarettes to Eclipse. Three of these studies were performed with the original market product (GTC 5-535), while two used the currently marketed version (GTC 7-026). The subjects in these studies also do not appear to have been selected based on whether they were likely adopters of Eclipse. Moreover, the one study that was presented at a scientific meeting was limited to subjects who smoked more than 40 cigarettes per day/7 and it is unclear what proportion of such heavy smokers, who ate also in the minority among US smokers/* might actually switch to Edipse. This study involved bronchoscopic examination and lavage of subjects while smoking their usual brands and again after smoking Eclipse for twt) months. Significant reductions to a range of markers of bronchial inflammation were observed with Eclipse, compared to the usual brands. However, because the study subjects were heavy smokers, they had a significantly greater degree of bronchial iriflammaiion at baseline compared to the non-smokmg controls.

DISCUSSION

lb substantiate its claims of health reduction for Eclipse, RJR relics on data from several studies, which have been reviewed by a panel of experts that concurred with the results. These studies demonstrate that, mg for mg, the total particulate matter, or condensate, from. Eclipse under FTC conditions is less roxk than that from conventional tobacco burning cigarettes. However, on a unit for unit basis, Eclipse appears to be as toxic as the 1R5F cigarette, a result predicted by the relative yields of Eclipse as compared with CarlftM and Now, to the mouse skin painting studies, Eclipse condensate bad about one third the activity of the JR4Fcondensate. But compared to a cigarette like the IR5P, Eclipse ha* about ilucc times the amount of total particulate matter under PTC conditions (table 1). it Is also noteworthy that the inhalation

studies, unlike the smoke chemistry and in vitro assays, did not compare Kclipso to the 1R5P cigarette but to their usual smoking brands (that woe not specified). Tills raises the question of whether the JR5F might have performed as well as or better than Eclipse, as it actually did In the neutral red assay of whole smoke,

liken together, these considerations indicate that Eclipse Is likely more toxic than Now, and about as toxic as Carlton and the iR5V cigarette- Thus, RJR's marketing claim that Eclipse primarily heats tobacco {which, actually consists of tobacco derivatives) has no apparent advantage over burning it when brands having similar yields of "soot" ate compared, it is not clear whether with Eclipse, the soot which is ililuted by glycerin and water, Is analogous to the dEulion of tar by air in ventilated cigarettes.1* While manipulations such as this can affect the outcome of carefully selected tests, they do not ucc-essariiy result in important reductions In delivered doses of toxins, 01 in the incidence of illness or death. In actual smokers.

More importantly, there are no human studies reported by RJR Involving subjects who aie Likely to adopt Eclipse. Those that have been conducted to date compare EcBpse with an unsclccrcd array of brands, and the evaluations of bronchial taflamtnation involved only very heavy smokers, who arc unlikely to be typical of Eclipse adopters. Data supporting claims of reduced harm for a novel tobacco product as compared to conventional products must, in the final analysis, be relevant to the conditions under which the product will be used by consumers. The human studies conducted in support of KIR'S claims for tjclipse do not pass this teSL

Fox the most part, smokers get practically the same dose of nicotine and other toxins from their cigarettes, regardless of differences In nominal yields between brands." w The exception Is the delivered doses from the lowest yielding "ultra low" tar brands, such as Now and Carlton. While the actual deliveries of these cigarettes are higher than those predicted from the nominal l$0/FTC yields, they are still substantially lower than those of other brands." w Eclipse appears to have PTC yields that arc similar to the ultra low brands, but under actual human smoking conditions it delivers nicotine levels that are similar to the subjects' usual brands. The higher operating temperature of the device under actual conditions of use may explain this,' and may also increase the yields of toxic constituents.

The Institute of Medicine has recently published a thoughtful analysis of how a regulatory agency should approach the evaluation of a potential reduced exposure product such as Eclipse.' The Institute of Medicine panel deterromed that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that any currently marketed product, including Bclipse, actually delivered on the promise of reduced exposure, much less on that of reduced harm. Our analysis of Eclipse strongly supports this conclusion and also indicates that the current version of this product may be even more toxic than Us predecessors. Furthermore, It underscores the need for regulatory oversight, since the tobacco industry continues to introduce new FREPs with promises of reduced health risks.

In this brief review, we have not explored whether RJR's choice of assays and substrates was optimal, nor have we examined to detail issues such as the fact that a second rodent inhalation study was done only with an early pre-market prototype. Nonetheless, the data analysed permit us to conclude that the studies conducted to date on Eclipse do not yet adequately demonstrate this device to be less toxk than other cigarettes. Indeed, the evidence suggests that Eclipse Is as toxic or more toxic than a number of conventional products that have long been on the market.

Is there really "no cigarette like Eclipse", as RJR claims? It appears that, in terms of likely toxicity, there are at least several of them.

Whol this paper adds

There have been many attempts by tobacco companlei to develop and market low nicotine and ultralight cigarettes. In 1996, the Rj Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR) began test marketing Eclipse, a nova! cicjarette-llke smoking article that dslivars ct nicotine containing aerosol to tho user. RJR claimed that Eclipse, by heating rather than homing tobacco, reduces the risk of cancer and other diseases compared to conventional cigarettes. Analyses of this claim had not been conducted This paper analyses this claim by examining several data sources and scientific studies.

We bund that Eclipse appears to be at least at toxic as some commercially available cigarette brands and that the data do not support the health claims made about the product. Consumers may be misled by RJR's health claims into believing that Eclipse Is a safer cfWnative to conventional cigarettes, underscoring the need for regulatory intervention. The analyses reported In (his paper hove prompted the Massachusetts Department of Public Health to request that the Federal Trade Commission carefully review RJR's advertising and marketing practices for Eclipse and/or seek a temporary injunction banning its-sale under the FTC Act.

Conclusions

While RJR's test results Indicate that Eclipse may offer poien-tial health benefits to smokers, our analysis of these indicates that they do not support the product health claims, and ih&t consumers may be misled by the company's marketing materials.

The analyses reported here have prompted the MDPH to request that the FTC carefully review RJR's advertising and marketing practices for Eclipse and/or seek a temporary injunction banning its sale under the FTC Act, The department has also urged the Food and Drug Administration to assert its jurisdiction under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to regulate the sate, marketing, and distribution of Eclipse. Finally, the department has pethloo*d the National Association of Attorneys Genera] to investigate whether HJR is in violation of the Master Settlement Agreement because of the way in which the company is marketing Eclipse.
