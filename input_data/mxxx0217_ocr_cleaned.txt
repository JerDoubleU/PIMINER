5   BY MR. PAIGE:

6   Q.   Good morning, Dr. Figlar.

7   A.   Good morning.

8   Q.   My name is Gary Paige.  We met briefly before the

9        deposition.  I'm assuming  well, I know you have

10        been deposed before, so I assume you understand the

11        rules of the deposition pretty much?

12   A.   I do, yes.  Thank you.

13   Q.   And of course, if there's any question that I ask

14        you that you don't understand, you let me know.

15        And if there's any question that you don't know the

16        answer to, that's fine; that's fair.  Just tell me

17        you don't know.  Okay?

18   A.  Fair enough.

19   Q.  Okay.  Thank you.  For this deposition we asked you

20        to bring certain materials with you today.  Did you

22   A.  I did.  I believe so.

23   Q.  Okay.  Can you tell me what you brought?

24   A.  Sure.  I brought the complaint.  I brought the     | o>

25        notice.  I brought my CV.  I brought some

	interrogatories.  I also brought my expert report

	think you asked to  for me to bring from my last \

4
	
	three trials, which I have done all that, and a CD |

5
	
	of my reliance materials as well.                 [

6
	Q.
	Okay,  Thank you.  If you can just hand those to

7
	
	the court reporter so we can attach those as a

8
	
	composite Exhibit 1 to your deposition I would

	Q.
	Okay.  Thank you.

	(Exhibit 1 marked after the deposition for

13
	
	identification.)

14
	Q.
	Dr. Figlar, for the record, can you tell the  or

15
	
	tell me what position you hold with RJ Reynolds

16
	
	Tobacco Company?

17
	A
	Yes.  I'm the vice-president of cigarette product

18
	
	development for RJ Reynolds Tobacco.

19
	Q.
	And what is that? What do you do?

20
	A.
	What I do is I'm in charge of all of the cigarette \

21
	
	brands that RJ Reynolds sells and makes.  I'm also  ;;

22
	
	in charge of the contract development for certain

23
	
	contract work, like for BAT that we make products   [

24
	
	for, the Japan market for them.  I also have a     \

3
	
	program, leaf and blends maintenance, and the vapor \

4
	
	team also reports up through me.

5
	Q.
	Okay.  So one of the things you said that you are   I

6
	
	in charge of is the cigarettes that RJ Reynolds     i

7
	
	makes* correct?

8
	t\ 
	Correct.  Yes.

9
	Q.
	And that would include Pall Mall?

10
	A.
	It would, yes.

11
	Q.
	And it would include Pall Mall unfiltered

13
	A.
	It would.

14
	Q.
	And what does that mean, though, that you are in

15
	
	charge of  what does it mean that you are in

16
	
	o h a T" cr e of Pal 1 Ma 11 ri (Trirpff P'?'^

17
	A.
	What it means is R & D basically owns the

18
	
	specifications for the products, so we maintain

19
	
	those specifications.  We make sure that the

20
	
	cigarettes are made consistently from  basically

21
	
	from batch to batch, run to run.  We have to do

22
	
	maintenance, because it is an agricultural product,

23
	
	understand how the crop year variations may change,

24
	
	the overall quality of the tobacco.  So we have to \

25
	
	try to maintain consistency of those products.

1
	
	In addition, for compliance-based purposes, we [
 

2
	
	have to report on ingredients, how the cigarettes  i

3
	
	are made to the FDA, and be prepared for any other

4
	
	compliance-based activities that may occur.

5
	
	In addition, certainly in times past, but     j

6
	
	currently as well, if we choose to make a new

7
	
	style of a Pall Mall, or a Camel, or what have you,

8
	
	it would be the cigarette product development group |

9
	
	that would design and make those specifications to

10
	
	consumer satisfaction.                          j

11
	Q.
	When did you start reporting to the FDA the

12
	
	ingredients in the Pall Mall cigarettes?

13
	t\.
	To the FDA?

14
	Q.
	Yeah.

15
	r\ 
	Since the FDA bill was signed in 2009.

16
	Q.
	Okay.  You understand this is a case that involves

17
	
	Pall Mall cigarettes from the 1950s through the    \

18
	
	1990s; correct?                                 \

19
	i\ m
	In general I do, yes.

20
	Q.
	Okay.  And that was --

21
	t\ *
	I'm trying to remember the exact dates.  I'm sorry.

22
	
	I didn't mean to talk over you.  I'm just trying to

23
	
	remember the exact dates that I looked at the

24
	
	interrogatories of when Ms. Cheeley smoked Pall

25
	
	Mall.  I'm just trying to recall.  I thought it was j

	Page 9 I

1
	
	from the '60s to the '90s, but I may be wrong.

2
	Q.
	Okay.  And that was   regardless, that was before  j

3
	
	the FDA compliance that you're referring to;

4
	
	correct?

5
	A.
	Correct.  Yes.

6
	Q.
	Okay.  The FDA compliance that you were referring

7
	
	to, is there ongoing litigation with RJ Reynolds   \

8
	
	and the FDA right now?

9
	A,
	The only litigation that I'm aware of  excuse

10
	
	me  at this point is a conflict of interest case

11
	
	that Reynolds and other companies filed against the I

12
	
	r L/A witil regaro. u.o tne lormaLion or uns it oal^ liic

13
	
	Tobacco Products scientific Counsel.  There was one \

14
	
	other lawsuit with regard to graphic warnings that

15
	
	I'm sure you're aware the company has prevailed on. |

16
	
	So those are the only two  those are the only two |

17
	
	that I'm aware of.                             \

18
	Q.
	When you say  when you talk about graphic

19
	
	warnings, one of the things you told me is that you \

20
	
	are involved with BAT.  BAT is British American

21
	
	Tobacco Company; correct?

22
	A.
	We do  we may contract cigarettes for BAT, yes.

23
	Q.
	Right.  And BAT  I think you said, and maybe I

24
	
	heard you wrong.  The cigarettes that you're

25
	
	designing for BAT are marketed or sold elsewhere,

1
	
	not in the United States, but in other countries;

2
	
	is that correct?

3
	A.
	Mainly  well, really just Japan.

4
	Q.
	Okay.  And in Japan they do have graphic warnings;

5
	
	correct?

6
	A,
	No, they do not.

7
	Q.
	Okay.  In European countries, do they have the

8
	
	graphic warnings on the cigarette packs?  Do you

9
	
	know?

10
	A.
	In some European countries they do, yes.            j

11
	Q.
	Okay.  In South American countries?

12
	A.
	Maybe some.  We don't -- you know, Reynolds is a US

13
	
	company.  They sold all of the rights to their

14
	
	brands, Camel, et cetera, back in 1999, to Japan

15
	
	Tobacco.  So                                  \

16
	Q.
	To --

17
	A.
	Huh?

18
	Q.
	To who?  To BAT?

19
	A.
	No, to Japan Tobacco.  So if you see Camel outside

20
	
	of the United States that is a Japan Tobacco brand

21
	
	today.  So Reynolds  RJ Reynolds is a US company, j

22
	
	The only thing that we  that RJ Reynolds does, is \

23
	
	we do make some brands for BAT under contract at

24
	
	our facilities in Tobaccoville, and those are      \

1   Q.   The graphic warnings that  you are aware there

2        are graphic warnings in many countries around the

3        world; correct?

4   A,   I am, yes.  Certainly.

5   Q.   And the United States -- that's something the FDA

6        proposed that RJ Reynolds objected to; correct?

7   A.  Not  I don't think that's exactly right.  I think

8        it was in the statute that the FDA was to issue

9        graphic warn-Lngs, so Congress directed the FDA to

10        do that.  RJ Reynolds didn't believe that that was

11        appropriate from a First Amendment perspective

12        based on the warnings that the FDA attempted to

13        issue.

14            In addition, the FDA failed to provide

15        scientific evidence that the graphic warnings would

16        actually accomplish what they were intended to do,

17        which was to prevent  provide proof that teens

18        would be less likely to pick up smoking, that there

19        would be higher quit rates associated with the

20        warnings.  And they did do studies, but those

21        studies showed that they were not going to

22        accomplish that.

23            So at the end of the day, you know, with the

24        FDA being a scientific organization, I think they

25        have an obligation to provide scientific data that

	the warnings that they intended to put on the pack

2
	
	would accomplish what they were intended to do, and |

3
	
	they couldn't prove that.  And that was certainly

4
	
	part of that lawsuit.  And I'm sure you're aware of \

5
	
	Judge Leon's opinion and the circuit court's       I

7
	Q.
	Okay.  So they  the FDA and Congress wanted      f

8
	
	graphic warnings, and one of the reasons was, was   [

g
	
	to prevent or discourage teen smoking; correct?

10
	A.
	That would be the intent, yes.

11
	Q.
	And you  RJ Reynolds disagreed that graphic

12
	
	warnings would prevent or deter teen smoking;

13
	
	correct?

14
	i\ <
	Well, yes, because the FDA data suggested, and some I

15
	
	of the graphic warnings actually showed the

16
	
	opposite for teens, and you can                I

17
	Q.
	So                                          j

	You can  I'm sorry.  I'm not quite done.  I mean,

19
	
	you can  you can, you know, read that report on  \

20
	
	the FDA website that was available.  Some of those

21
	
	warnings actually had the opposite effect amongst

22
	
	teens.  So, you know, I just think it would be

23
	
	ill-advised to continue down that path if that 

24
	
	if your intent was to prevent teen smoking, you

25
		really wouldn't want the opposite to happen, which

	So it's your contention that the Reynolds documents

o
	
	that talk about young smokers, or young adults as

9
	
	14 to 24, it's your testimony under oath that that

1        things, but I'm not a doctor, a medical doctor.

2        Are you asking me the mechanism of how it works, or

3        are you asking me what do I know about it?

4   Q.   Sir, as a scientist for RJ Reynolds, and as the

5        vice-president of cigarette and product

6        development, and as somebody who's reviewed and

7        relied upon the scientific literature on

8        performance of the cigarette, do you know why

9        nicotine is addictive, how that process works, or

10        not?

11   A.   I mean, I think I do to a certain extent.  I -- you

12        know, I understand how the definition is laid out.

13        So I think nicotine, and nicotine in cigarettes, in

14        smoke, fulfills some of the criteria for addiction.

15        I know that nicotine enters the brain.  It binds

16        with nicotinic receptors.  I know that there are

17        certain brain chemicals that are released,

18        including dopamine, that certainly allow that to be

19        a pleasurable activity.  I'm certainly aware that

20        nicotine is a  has physiological effects.

21            So  but again, I am not a  you know, I'm

22        not a neuroscientist.  I don't  and I'm not an

23        addiction expert, so I don't know all the ins and

24        outs of it.  I am a scientist and I keep up

25        relatively current on information.

	Okay.  Do you know if NIDA is part of the National

	Institute of Health?

5
	ri 
	It may be.  I'm not sure.  I think I have said I'm

6
	
	not sure what NIDA is.  Would you like to tell me  \

7
	
	what it is, or would you like me to continue to

8
	
	guess?

9
	Q.
	No.  I just want to know what your knowledge about i

10
	
	some of these public health organizations is, and

11
	
	I'm just trying to find out what you know and what  [

12
	
	you don't know.

	I thought I was pretty clear when I said I didn't   \

15
	Q.
	Well, I apologize if I offended you by asking you

	about the public health community and that you are j

15
	A 
	I'm not sure that we've had, necessarily,

	disagreements with the FTC, the Federal Trade

18

	Have you reviewed the FTC reports?

19
	i\ 
	Sure.  I have reviewed a lot of FTC reports, yes.   \

	can't recall sitting here.

17
	Q.
	Over the years has RJ Reynolds had disagreement    \

	Okay.  What about the  just in terms of the

	leading  the leading public health organizations,

22

	They are certainly public health organizations.  I

	As I said, we are  we provide that information,

9
	
	those links to our consumers because we believe

10
	
	that consumers should get their information from  \

25
	
	at the time that they had them.  There has been a

1        long -- scientific alterations and changes over

2        time about what people consider about cigarette

3        products.

4            The Surgeon General, in 1964, did not say that o                nxcotine was ao.ciicti.ive*  iney saiQ it was a drug or

6        habituation, and that view held firm until 1988

7        when that definition was changed.  So that is, I

8        think, an inappropriate characterization of how RJ

9        Reynolds has conducted itself over time.

10            Certainly health information has changed over

11        time, over a 50-year period, and certainly

12        scientific positions can and do change over time.

13        We do not hold the same scientific positions in the

14        scientific community that Isaac Newton held.  Okay?

15        So things change over time, and my expectation and

16        my belief is that RJ Reynolds' positions have

17        changed over time, and they certainly have.

18   Q.  Okay.  Move to strike; nonresponsive.

19            But my question to you is, do you believe that

20        RJ Reynolds has been honest and forthright with the

21        Surgeon General about everything that RJ Reynolds

22        knew about smoking and health and the addictiveness

1                 MR. ^REINER:  Objection to the form.

2   A.   I do not agree with that, no.

3   Q.   Okay.  But you have heard these accusations

4        before?

5   A.   I think in general.  It's unclear to me how you

6        could after  between 1953 and 1988, when nicotine

7        was not considered to be an addictive drug, what

8        facts there would be to conceal that, but I don't j                 agre e.

10   Q,   Did the  did the internal research that you

11        looked at from RJ Reynolds, Brown & Williamson and

12        American Tobacco Company, did they discuss that

13        between 1953 and 1988 that they understood that

14        nicotine was an addictive drug?

15   A.   Scientific research?  No, there was none.

16   Q.  You didn't 

17   A.   Scientific research, no.

18   Q.   Okay.  Dr. Figlar, the  maybe we can move on to

19        another topic.  Let me find my notes.

20            You have testified that you believe prior to

21        1999 there was not enough information for RJ

22        Reynolds to conclude that smoking caused cancer;

23        correct?

24                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

1
	Q.
	I'll rephrase it then.  I'll rephrase it,  I'm

2
	
	just looking at your prior testimony, but I'll ask I

3
	
	it in this case.  Doctor, do you believe prior to   j

4
	
	1999 -- is it your  well, strike that.

5
	
	Is it your belief that prior to 1999 there was

6
	
	not enough information for RJ Reynolds to conclude I

7
	
	smoking caused cancer?

8
	A.
	They did not  they did not hold a firm cause and  [

y
	
	effect position prior to 1999.  p^xor to 1999, they

10
	
	believed that smoking was a risk factor, a

11
	
	significant risk factor in the development of those j

12
	
	diseases, but it wasn't until about 2000 when

13
	
	Reynolds made definitive statements about  and   |

14
	
	very clear and succinct statements about smoking   \

15
	
	

16
	Q.
	So in 2000, RJ Reynolds made strong statements

17
	
	where they admitted and concluded that smoking

18
	
	caused cancer; correct?

19
	A.
	I believe they did, yes, I mean, just to be

20
	
	completely unambiguous and not use a lot of

21
	
	scientific jargon to talk about what they believed

22
	
	the science was.

23
	Q.
	Okay.

24
	A.
	So I believe they were being misrepresented in

25
	
	terms of what they actually believed.

4        you say something is a risk factor, you are

5        revealing everything you believe that science says.

6        When you make an unambiguous statement about cause

7        and effect, then you're saying that there's  that

8        you  that, in essence, you know everything there

9        is to know about the development of that disease.

10        I think just the way those terms are used today are

11        different than historically the scientific

12        community has looked at it.  So they  Reynolds

13        stated what their position was from a scientific

14        perspective.

15   Q.  When is the first time RJ Reynolds concluded

16        smoking caused cancer publicly?

17   A.   When they used those words it was in 2000, right

18        around that time from.

19   Q.   When is the first time RJ Reynolds publicly

20        concluded that nicotine was an addictive drug?

21                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

22   A.   Again, I would say it was around the same time

	Look, I understand that people will smoke and

	people will come in and smoke cigarettes, so I     |

	certainly understand that.  What I do know is

8
	
	certainly the number of cigarettes that are made

10
	
	by up to and greater than 4 percent every year.    \

1        beings have smoked tobacco and a variety of other

2        things for millennia, and so, yeah, I understand

3        that there is going to be a certain number of

4        people that both continue to smoke and that will

5        start smoking.  I'm certainly aware of that.

6   Q.   Right.  And the new smokers, do you know, or do you

7        understand, that close to 90 percent of the new

8        smokers start before they are 18 years of age?  Do

9        you know that?

10                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

11   A.   I am certainly aware that certainly the public

12        health community suggests that that is the case.

13        Yes, I have read that.

14   Q,   And  okay.  And so knowing that  that smoking

15        is addictive and smoking causes diseases like lung lo                 Ccincer, nnroau cancer, pancreatic cancer, nearc

17                disease, emphysema, and bladder cancer, and knowing

20        do you agree that it would be a bad idea to target

21        teenagers to begin smoking?

22                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

23   A.  Yes, it's a bad idea.  It is bad for RJ Reynolds'

1        business in general, so, yes, we do not agree.

2        Cigarette smoking is an adult activity and should

3        be made  those decisions should be made as

4        adults.  That is what we state on our website.

5        That is what we believe.

6   Q.   Let me  strike that and let rephrase it, because

7        maybe I wasn't clear.  I'm not talking about bad

8        for business.  I'm talking about bad for people's

9     *" lives.  Okay? So taking aside what's bad for your

10        profitability or your business and put it to the

11        side for a minute, I want to talk about would it be

12        bad for  for health reasons.  Okay? So let me

13        rephrase the question with that premise, if that's

14        fair.  Okay?

15   A.  Okay.

16   Q.   So knowing how addictive your product is, and how

17        deadly it is, and knowing that it's been reported

18        that up to 90 percent of smokers start smoking

19        before they are 18, would you agree that it would

20        be wrong for any tobacco company at any time,

21        whether it was the 1950s, the '60s, the 70's, to

22        intentionally target and market to teenagers?

9
	t\  a
	Twenty-five?  I don't know.  But I believe an adult }

10
	
	is the -- someone over the age of 18.  I think you

11
	
	have just said that you believe  and, of course,

12
	
	I haven't seen the papers you're talking about, but j

13
	
	90 percent of smokers start before the age of 18,

14
	
	and that would certainly mean that at least 10

15
	
	percent start after the age of 18.

16
	
	I know myself, I started when I was 18 years   j

17
	
	old  or 17  17 or 18 years old.  I can't

18
	
	remember exactly when.  But -- and I certainly know j

19
	
	that there are people who started after that, so -- j

20
	
	who are smokers.                                   f

21
	Q.
	Right.  But that's what I was staying.  I guess    \

22
	
	maybe I wasn't clear.  Ninety percent begin before  j


	
	the age of 18, and 10 percent begin after the age   j

24
	
	of 18.  Do you have any reason to disagree with    j

25
	
	those numbers, by the way?

	I don't.  I just -- I mean, do I have reason? No.

2
	
	I have seen and read those types of numbers before. j

3
	
	I think the numbers vary anywhere between  I

4
	
	mean, there  I have seen numbers less than 90

5
	
	percent, obviously.  I was  I was really only

6
	
	answering your question.  But I think you said that

7
	
	unless you started as a teenager, you were unlikely j

8
	
	to be a smoker.  And I'm just simply stating the

9
	
	fact that, you know, the statistics would not argue \

10
	
	that.  If there's -- you know, at least 10 percent

11
	
	of the smokers out there started after they were

	Well, there is a big push by the world health      \

	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.      |

16
	A.
	I believe that is  that in general that is

17
	
	correct, yes.

18
	Q.
	And the reason  in the health community and the   \

19

	this case and, again, you have been listed as a

3
	
	understand based upon your position in RJ Reynolds,

4
	
	based upon your review of the literature and your

5

	Okay.

	I appreciate that. And I know you are and I

	you seen  in your review of the literature and

19
	
	your familiarity with the health organizations,    \

20
	
	have you seen where smoking has been deemed to be a !

	terms used?

23

	I have.  I have also seen literature, and I think

1        have ever been since they have been taking

2        measures.  So I think certainly progress has been

3        made, I think, on all fronts around trying to

4        combat youth smoking at least in this country.

5            So, yes, I'm aware of the  I'm certainly

6        aware of the issues around smoking.  I'm certainly

7        aware of the concern of the public health community

8        around youth smoking.  I mean, I work in the

9        industry, so of course I'm aware of these issues.

10        So --

11   Q.  Okay.  So that  that's all  listen, and I

12        appreciate that, and I thank you for that, but I'm

13        just trying to see if we can talk on the same page.

14        We know there is a serious problem with smoking and

15        health and we know that there is a large percentage

16        of smokers who begin this addictive process as

17        teenagers; correct?

18                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the prefatory

19        comment that wasn't a question.  Go ahead.

20   A.   Obviously I'm aware.  Yes, I am aware of these

21        issues.  If you're -- again, this is why Reynolds

22        has spent a good deal of time and effort in trying

24        Card programs at the retail level to make sure our

25        products are not sold to youth.  This is why we

5        and advocate possession laws against teens actually

6        possessing tobacco products, because we don't want

7        youth to use our products.  We believe it is an

8        adult activity that should  and those decisions

9        should be made by adults.

15   Q.  Okay. But my question  maybe my question is

16        wrong.  Do you understand that there is 5,000 teens

17        who try their first cigarette every day?

18   A.   Am I aware of every statistic around youth smoking?

19        No, I am not.  What I have told you is what I know,

20        which is, the youth smoking incidence in this

21        country is at its lowest level since they have been

22        taking those statistics.  So I believe there is

23        progress being made.  Is it perfect?  No.

24   Q.   Okay.  Well, smoking is at the lowest levels, as

25        well.  It used to be 50 percent of the public

	smoked and now we're down to about 19 percent;

2
	
	correct?

3
	A.
	That is also correct.                           1

	Q.
	And now there is a lot more information out there  \

5
	
	about smoking and health on your website and to the \

6
	
	consumer public, in general; correct?

7
	A.
	I mean, there's always been quite a lot of

8
	
	information, but, yes, there is certainly a lot of

y
	
	information around smoking health-related issues.   j

10
	Q.
	For example, we know now that  the public now    \

11
	
	knows that cigarettes contain chemicals such as

	I don't agree with your characterization.

	Q.
	Are you comparing the health effects of smoking

18
	
	cigarettes with eating lettuce?

19
	A.
	No, I am not.  I am saying that if you take lettuce \

20
	
	and you set it on fire and burn it, you will       I

21
	
	generate the same type of chemistry that you get    j

22
	
	when you burn tobacco.  And in fact, there are

23
	
	products on the market  one was called Bravo that [

24
	
	was made from dried lettuce.  We have analyzed that

25
	
	product.  It contains just as many carcinogens as   I

1        cigarette smoke from tobacco.  So, no, I am not

2        comparing smoking cigarettes to eating lettuce, but

3        I am certainly comparing the chemistry between the

4        two when you use the products in the same way.

5   Q.  Do you think you  do you think it would be a good

6        idea to advertise and let consumers know the

7        comparisons you just made with the cigarette

8        smoking and lettuce?

9                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

10   A.   I would think the people who make the Bravo

11        cigarette probably would have that obligation,

12        yeah, that when you burn lettuce you're going to

13        get the same types of toxic compounds out of that

14        cigarette as you would if you smoked a tobacco

15        product, absolutely.

16   Q.   Do you think that  do you agree 45 percent of all

17        smokers  it's been estimated about 45 percent of

18        all people who smoke, are regular smokers, will end

19        up dying of a health  smoking health-related

21   A.   I don't know if that's correct, or not.

22   Q.   Well, you work for RJ Reynolds.  You reviewed these

24        with the public health communitv.  And vou are a

6
	
	not have the responsibility of deciding how a

7
	
	particular substance would be either habituating or j

8

9
	
	never questioned whether or not  the definition

10
	
	that the Surgeon General put out in 1964.  So, you I

14                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

15   A.  The only statements that I'm aware of in all the

16        cases that I have done is a lawyer's statement and

17        a marketer's statement around labeling nicotine as

18        addictive.  So I would be -- I would be surprised

19        if there was any scientific study undertaken by 

20        certainly by Reynolds, that looked at the question

21        of addiction and concluded that it was.

7                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

8   A.   I'm  you know, I think RJ Reynolds certainly has

9        looked into nicotine and tried to understand the

10        effect of nicotine on the body.  Over the years

11        they certainly have looked at that,  I'm not sure I

15        should be considered to be addictive, or not?  If

16        that is your question, I don't agree.

17   Q.   I don't know how you could have possibly conceived

18        that to be my question, most respectfully.  My

19        question is simply, would you agree that RJ

20        Reynolds, as a manufacturer of cigarettes, has a

21        responsibility to understand and know the effects

22        that nicotine will have on the body and brain of

7
	A.
	RJ Reynolds certainly looked at those issues in the |

8
	
	1980s.  They in fact published a book on the       j

	What about in the '60s and '70s?

	When did RJ Reynolds first know that nicotine was   |

	A.
	I would imagine they have always kind of known

7
	
	about it since it has been identified in tobacco

8
	
	products.  I mean, as far as back as the Reynolds

9
	
	research goes, I think Reynolds would have had a

10
	
	recognition that nicotine is important to tobacco   |

11
	
	products, certainly going back well into the '50s.

12

	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.      |

19
	A.
	You know, I don't know.  I mean, I think Reynolds

20
	
	has been pretty open in terms of what they have

21
	
	known about their products and -- with the specific j

22
	
	case of what they have known about nicotine.  As I

23
	
	said, they published a book.

24
	Q.
	Was that a book that was published for scientists

	to read or consumers to read?                     1

	I am aware of that short-lived campaign, yes.

	risk of disease and the physiological effects of

5

	I would say in general that is the case.  I mean,

	general.

12
	Q.
	Okay.  When  that's what I wanted to know.  When

13
	
	was the first campaign that RJ Reynolds undertook

	where they advised - where they fully and

11
	
	w \J 1 I. C L L 

12
	A.
	I mean, I believe in general that that should be

	Q.
	And that would be true not only today, but also in

15

16
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.     1

17
	A 
	I mean, I think in general that is correct, yes.    j

18
	Q.
	And teenagers and adults alike, at all times in the

19
	
	'50s through the '90s, had a right to be fully and

	accurately informed about the health risks and the

	addictive nature or the physiological effects of

22
	
	nicotine; correct?

23
	
	MR. KREINER;  Objection to the form.

24
	A.
	I mean, I think 

25
	
	MR. PAIGE:  Hold on.  What's wrong with

1
	
	the form?

2
	
	MR. KREINER:  I don't know what you mean

3
	
	by consumers having a right, whether that's a legal \

Tt
	
	right, or otherwise, and the question is horribly   |

5
	
	overbroad in that it fails to identify what health  j

6
	
	effects and what aspects of nicotine and what

7
	
	aspects of addiction that you are asking him to

8
	
	comment on.

9
	Q.
	Okay.  I'll rephrase it.  You are familiar on the   i

10
	
	website where it says consumers have a right to be  j

11
	
	fully and accurately informed; correct?  We spoke   f

12
	
	about that; right?

13
	A.
	It says consumers -- adult tobacco consumers;

14
	
	right?

15
	Q.
	Kignl

16
	A.
	I mean, I believe that's what the website says.

17
	Q.
	Right.  When they say, have a right, what does that

18
	
	mean to you as the RJ Reynolds representative?

19
	
	What does that mean to you that adult tobacco

20
	
	consumers have a right to be fully and accurately

21
	
	informed? What does the word "right" mean?

22
	r\ 
	I believe that consumers should be able to be      \

23
	
	exposed to all information with regard to         j

24
	
	tobacco-related issues, and they have a right to be 1

25
	
	informed on accurate health-related information.

1            So I think they  smokers  if you follow

2        the information, okay, over 80 percent  or over yu percent or tobacco-users do not Know that

4        smokeless tobacco carries with it a lot lower risk

5        than smoking cigarettes.  So to your average

6        smoking population, or tobacco-using population,

7        people believe that using smokeless tobacco and

8        smoking cigarettes is the same risk.  That to me is

9        not exposure to accurate health-related

10        information.  So that's when we say  when we make

11        that statement on our website, we are Saying adult

13                 right to accurate health-related information around

15   Q.   Okay.  Move to strike.  The only reason  and I'm

16        saying this because you -- some of your answer is,

17        in my opinion, non-responsive.  And the only reason

18        I re-asked it was because the lawyer objected to

19        whether we have an understanding of the word

20        "right," which I think we do.  But  so I just

21        want to  if we can, just talk about the word

22        "right" for a second  for a minute just to

23        satisfy his objection and we can move on.  Okay?

24   A,   Yeah, and that  and I think through my

25        explanation, I think I explained to you what I

1        believe the right of information is, is that they

2        have the right 

3   Q.   I missed that.

4   A,   Well, I'm sorry.  I think they have the right to

5        accurate information.  And my example was, and this

6        is known both in the public health community, as

7        well as the tobacco industry, that smokers don't

8        understand the relative risk differerice between

9        tobacco products.  They don't understand that

10        today.  They have a right to understand that.  They

11        should understand that, and they do not today.

12        That's what I mean by right, and that's my

13        example.

14   Q.   Okay.  So let me go back to your words, then, and

15        then I'll rephrase it.  Do you agree that adult

16        tobacco consumers have the right and should be

17        fully and accurately informed about the risks of

18        disease and smoking; correct?

19   A.  They should on smoking and tobacco use in general,

20        yes.  Absolutely, they should.  And I don't believe

	Okay? RJ Reynolds cannot say anything about those

2
	
	issues.

3
	Q.
	I don't even know what you're talking about.  So

4
	
	again, let me talk about cigarettes then.  I want

5
	
	to maybe  because you're talking about chewing   |

6
	
	tobacco.  I don't know what that has to do with

7
	
	this.  So let me ask you about cigarettes.  I'll

8
	
	make it more specific.  Do you agree that cigarette |

9
	
	smokers have a right to be fully and accurately

10
	
	informed about the risks of serious disease and

11

	Okay.  Do you agree that teenagers, before they

14
	
	even begin smoking, should be informed about the

15
	
	risks of smoking?                                1

16

	Yes.

19
	
	of -- the physiological effects of nicotine on the

20
	
	body and brain?

21
	
	I think in general  I mean, I think that's a

	But, I mean, I think to that extent, that's what I

	cigarettes contain nicotine, and smoking exposes    \

5
	
	you to nicotine, and it may be very difficult to

6
	
	quit.  I think that's what they should have a      f

7
	
	right, and certainly have good understanding, to

8
	
	know.

9

10
	
	how deadly and addictive smoking is, correct,       j

11
	
	before they start smoking?

12
	A.
	I certainly think they  they should, and I think \

13
	
	they have certainly been, at least, educated.  I

14
	
	know  look, I'm almost 50 years old.  I remember

15
	
	very clearly being told all through my grade school j

16
	
	and high school about the dangers associated with

17
	
	smoking.  i certamiy nave   my parents ana my    j

2
	
	this country.  I certainly am aware of those       \

3
	
	danger s.

4
	Q.
	Okay.  Well, certainly you have had  you have

5
	
	had  and I'm sorry for your loss.  But you had

6
	
	grandparents who died of emphysema.  It must have   |

7
	
	been horrible for you; correct?

8
	A.
	It was, yes.

9
	Q.
	You saw the suffering that they went through;

10
	
	correct?

11
	t\ 
	I did, yes.

12
	Q.
	And they probably started smoking at a time much -- \

13
	
	you know, a lot earlier when smoking  the        \

14
	
	understanding about smoking and health was a lot

15
	
	different than what you knew or what we know today;

16
	
	correct9

17
	A.
	They certainly  they started smoking at a time

18
	
	when the understanding was different.  There's no

19
	
	question about that.  But they certainly had made

20
	
	warnings to me and to my family that I shouldn't

21
	
	smoke, that it's dangerous, and they were certainly ;

22
	
	aware of it.  So                             j

2        consumers, people can die.  You know that, don't

3        you?

5   A.  You know, I don't know if misleading is going to

6        lead to death.  I believe that the manufacturers

7        have a right to state what they believe at any

8        given time that they believe it based upon their

9        understanding of the science and the data

10        associated with their product.  That is what I

11        think they should be doing.

12   Q.  Well, it's important for the tobacco companies to

13        be right about what they believe in and what they

14        are telling the public, though, when you're dealing

	I'm pretty sure the '12 is.                      |

t;
	Q.
	And the 2012 report actually indicates that the    \

5
	
	tobacco companies spend more than a million dollars \

6
	
	an hour in this country alone marketing their      I

7
	
	product; correct?

8
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

9
	A.
	I'm not  I don't know that to be correct.  It may \

10
	
	be in that report.  We can look at it.  I don't

11
	
	have the report in front of me.  Certainly we

12
	
	spend  RJ Reynolds spends money marketing its

13
	
	product.  If you read the FTC report from 0-10, you \

14
	
	will see that over 95 percent of the money we spend \

15
	
	is in discounting our products at retail.  You     I

16
	
	know, that's  that is part of marketing the

17
	
	product, is providing discounts to consumers at    |

18
	
	retail, and that's where we spent the vast majority j

19
	
	of our money.

20
	Q.
	The 2012 report concludes that tobacco product

21
	
	advertising and promotions entice far too many

22
	
	young people to start using tobacco.  Do you agree

	A.
	I will try my best.                             \

17
	Q.
	Okay.  In the 2012 report that you reviewed, it

18
	
	indicates, "Tobacco use is a global epidemic among  [

19
	
	young people.  As with adults, it poses a serious

20

18
	
	that the incidence rate of smokers in this country \

	is less than 20 today.                           \

	right?

23
	t\ .
	Well, that's what you've said, yes.

7                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form, the

8        prefatory comment that wasn't a question.

9   A.  Again, I don't know if I can agree or disagree with

10        the Surgeon General on that.  What I can say is I

11        think that the smoking incidence in this country

12        is less than 20 percent.

13   Q.  Most young smokers become adult smokers.  Does RJ

14        Reynolds agree or disagree with that?

15   A.   I mean, I don't know if I can agree or disagree.  I

16        don't know that we have a position on that.

17   Q.   One-half of all adult smokers will die prematurely

18        from tobacco-related diseases.  As a product

19        manufacturer of cigarettes, do you know that?

20   A.   I believe certainly that the product carries with

21        it significant risks.  I don't know that that

22        number is accurate, but I certainly think that it

23        is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in 4       this country.

1   Q.   In 2008 the tobacco companies spent $9.94 billion

2        on the marketing of cigarettes and 5 -- well, 547

3        on the marketing of smokeless tobacco.  Do you

4        agree that the industry spent close to $10 billion

6                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

7   A.   The industry in total?  I don't know what the

8        numbers are.   I'd have to look at the reports.

9   Q.   Well, you looked at the reports.  Do you want me to

10        send it to you?  I can fax it to you.  Do you want

11        to see it?

12   A.   I mean, I just knew the percentage.  I don't know

13        what the  what the total number is.  I remember

14        that the -- yeah, I don't remember what the total

15        number is.  What I remember is the percentage that

16        was spent on promotion.  So whatever that number

17        is  90 to 95 percent of the total ^mo-cmr, marketed

18        q|- cigarettes was spent on ppi^g promotions ^

19        retail.  It might even be higher than 95 percent.

20        But I recall it beincr well over 90 percent.  But I

21        don't know what the total number spent was; that's

22        all I'm saying.

	Okay. We talked about  I think it was in the    [

10
	
	'40s and '50s, about 50 percent of the population

11
	
	smoked; correct?                               j

12
	A.
	I believe the incidence was quite high.  I don't

13
	
	know if it was  it might have been 50.  I 

14
	
	that might be true.  I know it was very high.

15
	Q.
	Right.  And at that time there was less people

	then, but now we have more people but a lower

17
	
	percentage; correct?

18
	A.
	Correct.

19
	Q.
	So there has always been about 40 to 50 million

20
	
	smokers in our country, more or less; correct?

	Well, I don't know that I can agree, because I

	don't know that I know what the population of the

6
	
	United States has been over the course of six or

7
	
	seven decades.  Okay? So, I mean, if you want me

8
	
	to do the math, that's fine, I can, but I don't

9
	
	have, you know, population statistics memorized in

	the population is roughly today, but, I mean, I

12
	
	don't know what it was in 1950.

	No, that's fair.  But assuming that the population

	was a hundred million or more back in the '50s,

	tens of millions of Americans who were smokers,

	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

13
	A.
	I certainly believe that's possible.  Nicotine is

14
	
	addictive and there is certainly that chance,

15
	
	y fc# Oft

16
	Q.
	Well, it's not a chance.  We know statistically    \

17
	
	that a regular smoker, depending how you define it, :

18
	
	whether it's a two-cigarette-a-day smoker or a     >

19
	
	two-pack-a-day smoker, the statistics have been

20
	
	that 50 to 90 percent of regular smokers are

21
	
	addicted to nicotine; correct?

23

	Okay.  Fifty to 90 percent?  That's a pretty large

	feasible and that's what my comment means.  It

	doesn't mean that every single person who smokes

	that's all I meant to say by my answer.

	Some  some of the literature says 90 percent of  j

	I've seen 90.  I've seen 50.  I've seen 40.  You

10
	
	know, I've seen all kinds of numbers.  I would

11
	
	certainly agree that certainly a certain number of I

12
	
	people can, and do, become addicted to nicotine in

	cigarettes, certainly.                           j

14

	Right.  All I'm saying, Doctor, respectfully, is

2   A.   xhat is certainly possible.

4        It's likely?

5                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

6   A.   There's definitely risk associated with it, yes.  I

7        mean, it certainly has happened, yes.

8   Q.   And that's what I want to know.  As a

9        representative of RJ Reynolds, do you claim

iu       Lfidt.    tinere s lu636 teenagers wno ^^re st.art.incj to 11       smoke in the '40s and '50s.  Some of them are z       becoming daaiciea to nicotine.  oome or tnem nave

13        tried to quit and then they end up dying of a

14        health-related disease.  What responsibility, if

15        any, does RJ Reynolds think that they owe to these

17                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

18   A.   You know, I don't know.  I mean, I think, you know,

19        just because you've become addicted to a product

20        does not mean that you can't quit.  I mean,

21        addiction doesn't mean that you can't quit.

22        Obviously there is more smokers  former smokers

23        out there who have quit than there are current

24        smokers.  So I think people have to understand what

	with the product that they are using and make

2

	with that behavior, or not.  So whether you are    I

4
	
	addicted, or not, does not mean you cannot quit.    1

5
	
	You obviously do.  There's that many smokers     \

6
	
	there's that many former smokers out there  let's j

7
	
	just say 50 percent of them become addicted.  Well,

8
	
	there's over  well over 40 million people who

9
	
	nave quit.  Certainly a lot or tnose were addicted^ i

11

	I'm going to talk to you  I'm going to talk to

12
	
	you about that 40 million number.  I promise you    \
 l

13
	
	I'm writing it down and we'll have a discussion    |

14
	
	about it.  But 

15
	A.
	I don't know if 40 million is the right number.

16
	
	I'm just making a suggestion.  We know there's

17
	
	about 40 million smokers today and we know there

18
	
	are more than  there are more former smokers than j

19
	
	there are current smokers.  That's why I threw that \

20
	
	out there.

21
	Q.
	I'm not going to hold you to that number, whether

22
	
	itfs 40 million or 50 million.  I'm going to talk

23

	who ended up becoming addicted to nicotine, many of j

	people chose to use throughout a certain amount of  j

8        the jury how many smoking clinics RJ Reynolds has

	More people quit cold turkey than any other means

	I think it was much closer to 20.  It might have

7
	
	been 19 or 20. And I think in the '80s it was 

8
	
	it might have been over 20 per day.

9
	Q.
	Okay.

10
	A.
	So the consumption rate and -- in other words, the

	So now we have a lower consumption rate.  We have a

	lower percentage of people smoking in our country;

	correct?

17

	You certainly do, yes.

18
	Q.
	And with this, though, we know that there is still

19
	
	a percentage of people who are smoking  strike

20
	
	that.

21
	
	The average is 13 to 15 cigarettes.  So we

22
	
	Know wnar unar, means, is some people are smoKing

23
	
	less than that amount and some people are smoking

24
	
	more than that amount; correct?

1
	Q.
	All right.  So that's what it means.  Some people

2
	
	are smoking less than that amount and some people

3
	
	are smoking more than that amount; correct?

4
	t\ m
	Correct.

5
	Q.
	So what that means is that there is some people who \

6
	
	are smoking two to three, four cigarettes a day, or j

7
	
	less, and some people are smoking one, two packs a

8
	
	dav, or more; correct?

o
	A,
	Possibly.

10
	Q.
	And so within that we know that there is also a    j

11
	
	certain percentage of these regular smokers who are i

12
	
	addicted.  Not everybody is addicted; correct?

	I would agree with that.                         |

14
	Q.
	Some people are heavy smokers.  Some people are    j

15

16
	
	others are not; right?                          j

17
	A.
	I would agree that that would be true, yes.       \

18
	Q.
	And knowing that some people are smoking  and you i

19
	
	agree that some people are smoking  one of the

20
	
	main reasons a lot of these people are smoking is

j    t\
	Well, there's  there's a number of reasons for

4
	that.  One is we have.  We have put out products on \

	the marketplace that deliver much lower levels of

6
	nicotine than other products.  There have been

9   A
	I'm sorry.  I'm not done with my answer.  There

10
	have been numerous products that have come out over I

11
	the years that don't contain any nicotine.  They

12
	have not been commercial successes.  People don't

13
	like them.  Nicotine is, in fact, part of the

14
	sensory experience of smoking.  So  and

15
	tobacco  nicotine is a very important chemical in \

16
	tobacco.  So part of the whole experience of

17
	smoking and using tobacco products is nicotine.

18
	When you remove it, consumers certainly recognize

19
	that, and typically they don't like that.  So that  [

20
	is the general reasons for what we have done and

21
	why we haven't made a product, at least currently,

22
	that's got no nicotine.

1        nicotine^less cigarettes, has RJ Reynolds ever

2        looked into promoting nicotine-less cigarettes to

3        non-smokers? Because we have a population of t                 smoKers wno are ao.QiCL.ecL no nicouine ano. are

5        smoking  or are smoking cigarettes with nicotine.

6        But to the non-smokers who aren't smoking for

7        nicotine, have you tried to market nicotine-less o                        i_i_   to them ve t *^

9                                    MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

10   A.  RJ Reynolds has never made a cigarette that has no

11        nicotine.  So, no, I'm not aware that that has ever

12        occurred.  RJ Reynolds'  RJ Reynolds' business

13        model is predicated on adult tobacco-users.  It's

15        people who don't use tobacco products.  Certainly

16        there are, and have been, many forms of other

17        smoking devices.  I mean, there is clove cigarettes

18        out there that don't contain tobacco.  I have

20        cigarette.  So there is a lot of other

21        opportunities out there for people to smoke.  But

22        Reynolds has not done that.

23   Q.   But knowing that close to 90 percent of smokers

24        start before the age of 18, has there ever been an

25        effort to make sure that once these teenagers

1        start smoking, that if they do so, it should be

2        with a non-nicotine cigarette so they can quit more

3        freely whenever they choose to? Has anybody looked

4        into that yet?

5                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

6   A.   I'm not aware of that.  I don't know that  I know

7        certain things about products that don't contain

8        nicotine.  There is certainly scientific

9        information out there around lower amounts of

10        nicotine in cigarettes, and actually no-nicotine

11        cigarettes, and what they may or may not do for

12        quit behaviors.

13            In fact* there is a recent Canadian studv that

14        suggested that no-nicotine cigarettes provided more

15        craving relief than nicotine-replacement therapies,

16        so therapies that actually contain nicotine.  So

17        when people actually smoked a cigarette without

18        nicotine, the craving relief was better even though

19        they weren't being exposed to nicotine.

20            So, you know, I don't know if that has 

21        whether or not a no-nicotine cigarette is going to

22        allow people to quit easier.  It may; it may not.

23        What I do know is that if you smoke a no-nicotine

24        cigarette, you will continue to expose yourself to

25        all the toxicants and carcinogens that potentially

2   Q.  Okay. More to strike. And maybe you didn't

3        understand me.  You are talking about allowing to

4        quit easier.  My question respectfully, Doctor,

5        was, I was talking about pre-smokers.  So I asked

6        you if RJ Reynolds ever looked into the fact that

7        since 90 percent of smokers start before they are

8        18, have you ever looked into making sure that when

9        a teenager does start smoking, that if they do so, 10                 they do it with a nicotine-less cigarette so that

12                 they can do so freely without being addicted to

j                 nicotine:  nave you looKea into inat or researcnea

14        that at all yet?

15                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.

16   A,   I was trying to tell you, you know, what I am

17        exposed to and what kind of scientific research

18        there is available.  What I do know is that I would

19        not agree with trying to get youth to smoke a

20        nicotine-less cigarette because that's just not 1                part or what we do or any reason why we would do

22        it.  If you smoke any cigarette, whether it

23        contains nicotine or not, you expose yourself to

24        carcinogens and toxicants that cause, and can

1      Q.  Okay.  But my question to you is, have you done that yet, or no?

3   A.  We -- all  what we have done is we have attempted

4        to try to reduce the toxicants in smoke.  We have o       noL triea to put out a nicotine less cigarette.

6   Q.  Have you tried to put out a cigarette with low

7        levels of nicotine that's not addictive?

ft                                                                 MR  TCR'F,T'NI"F,'R*  ^i____^___a__^i__ _,__

9      A.  We have put out cigarettes that have lower amounts

10        of nicotine.  I don't know where that non-addictive

11        threshold is.  I don't believe it's been

12        established ^ science to this point.

13   Q.   Well, how many milligrams of nicotine are in each

14        cigarette?  Is it .8?  No, tell me.  I don't know

15        the number.  What is the number?

16   A,   Tobacco, as a percentage, contains around 

17        anywhere  in typical American cigarettes,

18        anywhere from 2 to 4 percent of the weight of

19        tobacco is nicotine.  So a typical cigarette may

21        milligrams of nicotine in the rod.  What's

22        transferred in smoke typically, for today's normal

23        cigarettes, or the largest part of the market we

24        have that exists today, is somewhere around a

25        milligram of nicotine is  usually a little less,

1
	
	but somewhere around a milligram.

2
	Q.
	Okay.  Maybe I  so about a milligram of nicotine

3
	
	is smoked with each cigarette, I think, 1 to 2

4
	
	milligrams?

5
	i\ .
	Based on -- based on  I'm sorry.  Based on, you

6
	
	know, machine-smoking.  Obviously people have

7
	
	behaviors.  They can get more or less than that.

8
	
	I was trying to give you a flavor for what actually [

9
	
	exists in the cigarette before it s burned and     \

10
	
	smoked and then what you can measure coming out of

11
	
	the smoke.  So there is  there is a big           5

12
	
	difference.  But 

13
	Q.
	So there is about 1 to 2 milligrams of nicotine     \

14
	
	smoked with each cigarette; correct?

15
	A.
	Yeah.  Usually less than two, but yes.  Coming out

16
	
	in the smoke, yes.

17
	Q.
	And has RJ Reynolds tried to lower  my

18
	
	understanding is, that if you have .1 or ,2

19
	
	milligrams of nicotine, that that would be to the

20
	
	level where itfs not addictive.  Have you learned

	Q.
	 tobacco?

14
	A.
	You know, I don't know if we could on a grand

15
	
	scale.  I mean, I think we -- it can be done.  It

16
	
	has been done.  But at the scale in which the

17
	
	tobacco industry and the consumers buy cigarettes,

18
	
	I don't know if it can be successfuiiy done, or

19
	
	not.  We're certainly  we certainly have programs ?

20
	
	in place to look at how one could do that.

21
	
	Certainly we think the FDA may regulate in that

22
	
	direction.  So we are trying to prepare ourselves   jj

23
	
	for that.  But whether or not we can successfully

24
	
	do it, I don't know yet.

25
	Q.
	What is the lowest  I think you said there are

Page 133

1        different varying amounts of nicotine in different

2        cigarettes manufactured by Reynolds.  What were the

3        different levels that you were referring to, if you

4        could tell me?

5   A.  Well, I mean, the reason why there is different

6        levels, there is  different types of tobacco

7        generate different levels of nicotine in the plant,

8        and certainlv there is different amounts of

9        nicotine within a plant, okay, between the lower

10        stalk leaf positions and the higher stalk leaf

11        positions.

12            So we make cigarettes  the way we make

13        cigarettes is we try to make a cigarette that

I   /                                              yn\4ym **%. * y i   yJ g\ gn        ^*        Oil *f^ "P  "I   f* "\   y TO "H"        d 2k Y*\ C2 /*"\ V* X 7       &k "V T"^ O "V* 1   Oi TO Z*^* 2*       "f" ^*\       *$**  r"l C5

15        consumers who have that interest, and that's done

16        through leaf blending, and so you get varying

17        amounts of nicotine based on the type of cigarette

18        that one makes.  Some people like a stronger-

20        tasting cigarette.  You can have varying amounts of

21        nicotine and, therefore, types of tobacco in those

22        blends to accommodate that flavor profile.  So it

23        varies depending on the type and style of cigarette

24        being made.

3
	Q.
	I just want to know, and maybe I wasn't clear,

4
	
	what were the different levels of nicotine that

5
	
	you've provided in your cigarettes.  For example,

6
	
	have you had a cigarette that had 1 milligram of   |

7
	
	nicotine delivered with the smoke?

8
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

9
	x\ *
	There's certainly a range that is provided in our  j

10
	
	portfolio.  Okay?  I mean 

11
	Q.
	That's what I would like to know.

12
	A.
	There is -- but it's not based on nicotine.  It's I

13
	
	based on  tvpicallv it's based on tar yield,     

14
	
	which is really an indication of the strength of

15
	
	flavor that is in a cigarette.  So when we make a

16
	
	higher tar-yielding cigarette, with that comes

17
	
	nicotine, but we are not designing to have a

18
	
	certain amount of nicotine in the cigarette.  We

19
	
	are trying to design to a certain flavor profile,

20
	
	and those  the ones that are stronger have a

21
	
	nigner "car yield and a nigner nicotine yield l n a n

	tnose r,nat are

23
	Q.
	What is the nicotine yield?  That's all I want to I

24
	
	know.  What is the high nicotine yield and the low

25
	nicotine yield?  Can you tell me that, or not?    [

1
	A.
	Again, it's a range.  So the higher-yielding ones

2
	
	can be upwards of, based on machine-smoking, a

3
	
	little over a milligram to perhaps about half, or

4
	
	.4 milligrams of nicotine.  There are some

5
	
	products that we make that are .1 milligrams of

6
	
	nicotine.                                     \

7
	Q.
	Which is the one that you have that's .1 milligram

o
	
	of nicotine?

9
	A.
	Like the Carlton and Now products are very low-

10
	
	yielding products.  They're around .1.  They might

11
	
	even be lower.  They might even be .01, or .05,

12
	
	something like that.  I don't have them all

13
	
	memorized.

14
	Q.
	And then I did see where there was some research

15

	.15 milligrams per rod; correct?

	I am not making that statement, no.

	What is the  how many milligrams does Carlton

	I don't know, off the top of my head.

12

	Are you familiar with the research and the

	literature that said that if they reduce the total

14
	
	nicotine contents to ,5 milligrams per rod that

15
	
	would minimize the addictiveness of cigarettes?

	MR, KREINER:  Objection to the form.      \

22
	
	don't know what's going to happen if you make a

2        people are going to compensate and smoke more, or

6        the wisdom of doing that is right or not yet.  I

9   A.   We have been looking into the potential that the

11        several years and trying to figure out how we would

12         how we could try to meet those regulatory

14   Q.   But if you determine  with or without regulation,

15        if you determine that .5 milligrams per rod would

17        you were able to determine what level of nicotine

18        could be provided with lowering the level of

	A.   Well, I understand that, but I would ask a very

3
	simple question.  If you are not addicted, or if    

4
	you took all the nicotine out of smoke, out of

5
	cigarettes, and you still fired up the cigarette

7
	to the toxicants and carcinogens that cause

8
	disease.  So addiction, in my mind, can't be part

9
	of that mechanism,                               [

10
	as a sciGncist ano. as a cnemisc wno s stiuQieo i

11
	and looked at reaction mechanisms, if you have a

12
	step in a reaction mechanism that is unnecessary,

13
	it can't be part of the mechanism.  So if the      |

14
	mechanism leading to disease is due to the exposure \

15
	of toxicants, if nicotine is not in a cigarette but \

16
	you smoke and you fire up and combust tobacco

17
	without nicotine, you are still going to make

18
	carcinogens.  You are still going to make

19
	toxicants, and people will still have the ability

20
	to inhale and expose themselves to those toxicants,

21
	and they have the same chance of getting that

22
	disease.  So I don't think 

23
	Q.  Sir 

24
	A.    nicotine can be part of that mechanism, nor can

25
	addiction be part of that mechanism.

	It is, but it's  but it is scientifically valid.

5
	
	I mean, the nicotine isn't causing the diseases in

	smoke  related to smoking.  It's exposure to

7
	
	toxicants.  It's exposure to carcinogens.  If

3        have to look at that at trial because I'm not aware

4        of that.

5   Q.  Okay.  And you are not aware of any Benowitz

6        studies in the New England Journal of Medicine

7        where he talks about nicotine addiction causing

8        premature death and disease in our country? You

9        are not aware of that either?

10   A.   Look, I am --

11                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

12   A.   I am aware of the Surgeon General's position where

13        they say that nicotine is part of the mechanism of

14        disease causation.  I don't agree with that.  Okay?

15        I think I have stated very clearly that if nicotine

16        does not exist in tobacco, the act of burning and

17        combusting tobacco and exposing yourself to those

18        toxicants will still cause disease.  That's a fact,

20        I mean, at the end of the day  I mean, human

21        beings have been engaged in smoking a whole variety

22        of things throughout human history.  I just don't

23        think that's going to go away.  People have been

24        smoking tobacco.  People have been smoking other

25        opiates.  People have been smoking cloves, betel

1
	nut.  I mean, there is a whole host of things that

2
	human behavior has engaged in for millennia, and I

3
	don't think that's going to go away.

4
	And that's the reason why Reynolds has taken

5
	its research to try to reduce the amount of

6
	toxicants that are in that smoke, because nicotine

7
	is not the issue.  People aren't dying from

8
	nicotine.  They are dying from an exposure to

9
	toxicants and carcinogens in that smoke.

10   Q
	But people don't smoke to get toxicant  toxins

11
	and carcinogens.  People smoke for nicotine;

12
	right?

13
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

14   A
	That is not the sole reason why people smoke.  Why

15
	do people smoke cloves?  Why do people smoke betel

16
	nuts?  Why do people smoke other opiates?  It's not

17
	for nicotine.  Okay?  The behavior of smoking is

18
	complex.  People smoke for a lot of reasons.  Is

19
	nicotine important in smoking tobacco?  Absolutely.

20
	It is.  I'm not denying that it's  that it's not

21
	important.  It is.  But it's not the sole reason

22
	for that.  I think I have already described to you

23
	there is actually a chance that if you

24
	de-nicotinize cigarettes that people may like

25       smoking tobacco without nicotine, too.  I mean,

	to grad school, and I got accepted to the          |

24
	
	University of Massachusetts at Amherst where I     j

25
	
	eventually got a master's and a PhD in chemistry.

Atter my graduate aegree was done, I look a

2        post-graduate, a post-doctoral fellowship, National

3        Science Foundation post-doctoral fellowship at

4        Auburn University and spent almost two years doing

5        a post-doc before I got hired at Brown &

6        Williams.

7   Q.   And when were you hired at Brown & Williamson?

8   A.   In 1999.

9   Q.   And you told us you came to RJ Reynolds in 2004?

10   A.   Correct.  Yes.

11   Q.   While you were at Brown & Williamson from 1998 to

12        2004, did any of your job responsibilities include

13        attempts to reduce the inherent risks of cigarette

14        smoking?

15   A.  Yes.  All of my job responsibilities revolve around

16        trying to reduce the inherent risk associated with

17        smoking.

18   Q.   And in 2004, what were the circumstances by which

19        you came to RJ Reynolds in 2004?

20   A.  Brown & Williamson and RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company

21        merged in 2004, and so as a consequence of that

22        merger I was offered a job at Reynolds.

23   Q,  Okay.  And you have been at RJ Reynolds

24        continuously since 2004 up until today?

25   A.   Correct.  Yes.

10        that Dr. Teague actually did scientific laboratory

11        research on nicotine?

	Q.
	Doctor, this is the Tobacco Use and Health section

3
	
	of Reynolds' website?

4
	n. *
	It is, yes.

5
	Q.
	Can you read to us what Reynolds says about

6
	
	cigarette smoking?                              f

7
	A.
	Yes.  The first bullet point, it says, "Cigarette

8
	
	smoking is a leading cause of preventable deaths in \

9
	
	the United States.  Cigarette smoking significantly \

10
	
	increases the risk of developing lung cancer, heart j

11
	
	disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and other

12
	
	serious diseases, and adverse health conditions."

13
	Q.
	And is that statement consistent with what you     \

14
	
	understand to be the message from the public health |

15
	
	community about smoking causing disease?

16
	A.
	I believe it is consistent, yes.

17
	Q.
	You were asked some questions about Reynolds'

18
	
	position prior to the website.  Can you tell us

19
	
	what the basis of Reynolds' position was with      \

20
	
	respect to smoking as a cause of disease,          1

21
	
	historically?

22
	A *
	Yeah.  Historically, Reynolds' position would have

23
	
	been a recognition of the statistical association

24
	
	between smoking and disease, going back into the

25
	1960s; 1964, for instance.  But Reynolds' position  j

17        missing that were traditionally relied upon before

19                 community would establish cause and effect.

	what the 1964 Surgeon General's report provided was i

2
	
	actually a mechanism for the public health

3
	
	community to take action against certain perceived

4
	
	public health threats based on largely

5
	
	epidemiological type data.  Prior to that time     |

6
	
	frame, there was really quite a lot of evidence

7
	
	that was required both from a clinician standpoint, [

8
	
	as well as a statistical standpoint, before cause

9
	
	and effect relationships were firmly established.

10
	
	So really '64  the Surgeon General's report,     j

11
	
	really allowed for the public health community to  j

12
	
	take action against perceived public health threats |

	You mentioned in response to one of my earlier

16
	
	questions, Reynolds1 efforts to try to reduce the

17
	
	inherent health risk.  Would a mechanism be        j

18
	
	important in your efforts to try to do that?

19
	A.
	Sure.  Yes.  Absolutely.

	A.
	Well, if you know how the disease is propagated in

1        the human body, and you know mechanistically what

2        steps are required to bring to an endpoint that

4        something about it, which is why it's important to

5        know what the mechanism is, and then equally so,

6        it's important to know which of those  what are

7        the causative agents that would start to trigger

8        those mechanisms.  That would give an opportunity

9        for Reynolds, or others in the tobacco industry,

10        for instance, to know what things to do to the

11        product, potentially, that might lessen that

12        risk.

13   Q.   And how would knowing what the causative agents are 4                  or disease in cigarette smoke, how would that be

15        helpful to Reynolds in trying to reduce the

16        inherent risk of smoking?

17                       MR. PAIGE:  Objection to form.

18   A.   Well, it -- it would be critically important

19        because that would give Reynolds the opportunity to

20        know what they need to target.  Historically, there

21        has been a lot of conjecture and really, frankly,

22        guessing about what the causative agents are in

23        smoke.  If you look at the history of tobacco

24        science, you understand that in the 1950s, for

25        instance, the causative agents people thought were

11        disease.  We just kind of look at all of the ones

12        that have been identified.

13   Q.   To your knowledge, is there any public health

14        entity that has taken the position that if you

15        remove X compound, and whether it's benzopyrene or

16        phenols, or nitrosamines, or arsenic, is there any

17        entity that said if you remove these particular

18        compounds, people won't get diseases from

J \ji                                                                    /"t "| /"<f i|j y" jjjj t* T* tf^ ^s f

20   A.   No.  There is no public health authority, that I am

21        aware of, that has ever said if you remove X, Y, or

22        Z compound that you would impact public health.

23        The mantra from public health community is quit;

24        quit smoking.

	of Reynolds' historical position with respect to

2
	
	causation, ano. you rnaQe reference lo an animal

	model.  How would an animal model be important to

4
	
	Reynolds in terms of trying to reduce the inherent

5
	
	risk of cigarette smoking?                       [

6
	A.
	The importance of an animal model is simply this:

7
	
	We can do a number of things to try to alter the

8
	
	yield of particular toxicants in smoke or          [

9
	
	carcinogens in smoke.  If we are able to do that,

10
	
	you want to be able to test that against animals to \

11
	
	see if you have had an effect in a positive way.

12
	
	So that's the importance of animal models in

13
	
	general.

14
	Q.
	nilo. cLespiiie Lus iacjv on a mecnanism, l. n e lacjv or an

	identification of the causative agents, and the

16
	
	lack of a mechanism, has Reynolds, nonetheless,

17
	
	attempted to reduce the inherent risk of smoking?

18
	A.
	Yes.  It's been Reynolds' operating premise really

19
	
	since the 1950s.                                \

20
	Q.
	And despite wherever its position was with respect

21
	
	to what the scientific evidence showed with respect \

22
	
	to causation, has Reynolds attempted to reduce the

23
	
	risk of cigarette smoking since the '50s?         \

24
	A.
	Yeah.  I mean, that's been the -- that's been the   |

25
	
	operating premise.  So in other words, regardless  I

1        of what Reynolds felt about whether or not the

2        association between smoking and disease was strong

3        enough, or if there was enough scientific evidence

4        to prove cause and effect, they did recognize that

5        the association was there and operated the business

6        in the sense that if it is true, what should we be

7        doing to try to address it?  And certainly if you

8        look at Reynolds' actions over the last 60 years,

9        they have been proactive in trying to deal with

10        that from an operating premise perspective.

11   Q.   You were asked some questions about warning labels.

17        where a pack of cigarettes manufactured by

18        Reynolds, Brown & Williamson or American didn't

19        contain one of the federally-mandated warnings?

	Yes.  The public health community does say nicotine j

9
	
	What does Reynolds mean by that?                 1

	A.
	What Reynolds means is the compound nicotine, the  |

	chemical compound nj_CQtine, does not cause disease, l

12
	
	or has not been shown to cause disease in and of

	You made reference, and I just want to clear a few l

15

	of addiction.  Will you remind us what the         \

17
	
	conclusions of the Surgeon General were in 1964    \

18
	
	with respect to whether cigarette smoking was

19
	
	addictive or a habit?

20
	rx 
	Yeah.  I mean, I think it's Chapters 13, 14, or

21
	
	Chapters 12 and 13, in '64, spent a lot of time

22
	
	talking about nicotine in that Surgeon General's

23
	
	report.  The conclusion is that nicotine was a drug |

24
	
	of habituation, and they compared and contrast what

	what are the requirements for a drug of

	habituation, and the Surgeon General definitively

3
	
	concluded in 1964 that nicotine was a drug of

4
	
	habituation.

5
	Q.
	And do you know if Reynolds ever publicly disagreed \

6
	
	with the Surgeon General that cigarette smoking was

7
	
	habituating?

8
	A.
	They never disagreed, as far as I know.  No, I have \

^
	
	never seen anything where they disagreed with

10
	
	that.

11
	Q.
	You made reference earlier to the 1988 Surgeon

12
	
	General's report.  What happened in 1988 with      [

13
	
	respect to addiction, as it relates to nicotine in  ^

14
	
	cigarettes, with the Surgeon General?              j

15
	A.
	Well, I mean, a lot of things happened in that time [

16
	
	frame.  The definition itself, around what would be |

17
	
	considered to be an addictive drug, had changed    f

18
	
	over that time frame.  Specifically in '88, the     j

19
	
	Surgeon General made certain changes in the        \

20
	
	criteria by which things that were considered to be f

21
	
	addictive was different than it was in '64.        j

22
	
	Certainly people's  the social stigma around

23
	
	addiction and addicts had changed, as well, during \

24
	
	that time frame between '64 and 1988.  So a lot of I

25
	
	things in society had changed.  But specifically   j

9
	
	there was some new scientific finding with respect

10
	
	to nicotine in 1988 that led it to conclude that

11
	
	nicotine in cigarettes were addictive?

	Well, let me ask you, using the criteria that the

21
	
	what was known in '64, would cigarettes have been a \

22
	
	habit or an addiction using the '88 definition?

23
	A.
	Well, I mean                                  [

24
	
	

25
	A.
	I mean, if you use the '88 definition in '64, it   \

Page 172

1        would have been considered to be addictive.  Just

2        like if you use the '64 definition in '88, it would

3        be habituating.  So, I mean, when you change the

4        criteria and the definition of what's considered to

5        be addictive, then that  I mean, that's how it's

6        considered.  There was no new, you know, kind of

7        scientific revelation that occurred.

8   Q.   Are you aware of any instance in which RJ Reynolds,

9        American or Brown & Williamson has ever publicly

10        said that cigarette smoking may not be difficult to

11        Quit for some smokers?

12   A.  No.  They have never said that.  They have always

13        suggested that it could be difficult to quit.

14                 MR. KREINER:  Gary, do you have the 

15        or, I'm sorry, Mr, Paige, do you have the section

16        of the website that is for tobacco consumers and

17        has a harm reduction part of it?

18                 MR. PAIGE:  Yes, I do.

19                 MR. KREINER:  Okay.  I am going to show

20        Dr. Figlar that.

22   Q.   Can you tell us what Reynolds tells tobacco

23        consumers on its website about quitting?

2   Q.   And is that RJ Reynolds' position?

O          A             Vpn

4   Q.   And is, to the best of your understanding, that

5        position consistent with what the public health

6        community tells smokers about quitting?

7   A.   Yeah.  I believe it is consistent, yes,

8                 MR. KREINER:  Mr. Paige, I am now going

9        to the Public Health Information, Making Decisions

10        Regarding Tobacco Use, which is the section that

11        relates to Reynolds telling individuals they should

12        rely on conclusions of the Surgeon General and

13        others.  You asked Dr. Figlar about that earlier.

14        Do you have that section in front of you?

15                 MR. PAIGE:  I have it as a section, but

16        let me hear your question.  It might not  let me

17        hear the question.

18   BY MR. KREINER:

19   Q.  Okay.  Let me show you, Doctor  what does the

20        website tell about individuals seeking information

21        about smoking and health and where they should

22        go?

23   A.   It says  it's in the section Making Decisions

24        Regarding Tobacco Use.  It says, "RJ Reynolds

25        Tobacco Company believes that individuals should

2        Centers for Disease Control, and other public

3        health officials when making decisions regarding

4        smoking."

5   Q.  And in order to help people figure out what those

6        positions are, what information is on Reynolds'

7        website in terms of how they go about getting it?

8   A.  We provide links to Surgeon General's reports, and

9        American Cancer Society, and other public health

10        authorities.

11   Q.  And the mere fact that Reynolds refers the public

12        and smokers to those public health officials for jlj       Qecisions regarding smoKing, does Lnan. mean tinac

14        Reynolds agrees with everything those entities

15        say?

16   A.  No, it doesn't.

17   Q.  Okay.  Is Reynolds going to publicly debate on its

18        website disagreements that it has with the Surgeon

21       arguments around the science with regard to tobacco

23   Q.   But in the courtroom, when Reynolds is being sued

8
	Q.
	Okay.  I am going to switch topics, Doctor.  You

9
	
	were asked some questions about youth smoking and

10
	
	teenage smoking.  Let's be clear.  What is

11
	
	Reynolds' position with respect to whether

12
	
	teenagers should use tobacco products?

13
	i\ 
	They should not use tobacco products.

14
	Q.
	You mentioned some youth prevention or youth

15
	
	non-smoking initiatives, and I want to follow-up on \

16
	
	that.  One of the programs you mentioned was Right

17
	
	Decisions Right Now.  What is Right Decisions Right \

	Now?                                           I

	Right Decisions Right Now is a program that was

	prevent youth tobacco use been in place?

5
	i\ m
	It's been in place over 20 years.  Of course it's

6
	
	evolved over time, but it's been around for      I

7
	
	since the 1990s.                                f

	Q.
	And you mentioned something called the We Card     =

9
	
	program.  What's the We Card program?              I

10
	A.
	The We Card program is a retail program.  I think   \

11
	
	many of the tobacco companies participate in that.  jj

	people who participate in the We Card program.

15
	
	There's a sticker on the window saying "We Card."

16
	
	And what that is, is retailer training so that

17
	
	retailers get appropriate training on how to

18
	
	recognize proper identification, you know, how to

19
	
	kind of recognize, you know, fake identification,

20
	
	but also just the simple fact that they are going

21
	
	to card anybody that doesn't look to be, like, 30

22
	
	years old, or 27 years old, or something like that.

23
	
	So they are going to require identification before

	they can purchase a tobacco product.

1                  the We  Card program?

2       A.       Um-hum,   yeah.

3   Q.   Approximately how long has the We Card program been

4        in existence?

5   A.  For over 20  well over 20 years.  I think since

6        the '80s.  It could be longer.  I don't know the

7        exact date it was brought in.

8   Q.  You mentioned earlier tobacco legislation.  What is

9        Reynolds  or possession, tobacco possession laws.

10        What is Reynolds doing with respect to legislation

11        in its efforts to prevent youth use of tobacco

12        products?

13   A.   Well, look, we -- we believe that tobacco products

14        should be age-restricted to adults.  We believe

15        that in order to help to prevent youth access, that

16        part of the -- part of the requirement should be 

17        or we support laws that penalize teenagers who are

18        found to possess tobacco.  So it's one thing to try

19        to do things to prevent their access to tobacco

	Q.
	Switching topics, Dr. Figlar, you were asked some

3
	
	questions about nicotine and cigarettes and

4
	
	cigarette design, and I want to follow-up on those

5
	
	issues.  To be clear, does Reynolds add nicotine to \

6
	
	its cigarettes?

7
	A.
	No.  No, we do not.

8
	Q.
	Whv is there nicotine in cicrarettes?

9
	A.
	There is nicotine in cigarettes because the tobacco j

10
	
	plant manufactures nicotine in its -- in its very   I

11
	
	bing, so the plant makes it.                     \

12
	Q.
	Does Reynolds grow the tobacco that it uses in its

13
	
	cigarettes?                                       \

14
	A.
	No, we do not grow the tobacco.

15
	Q.
	Where does the tobacco come from?

16
	A.
	The tobacco comes from the farmers that we purchase j

17
	
	the tobacco from.  In the United States we have    j

18
	
	contract farmers that grow the tobacco.  We buy

19
	
	foreign tobacco, as well.  We purchase that tobacco \

20
	
	from leaf dealers

21
	Q.
	Is there nicotine in the tobacco when Reynolds buys j

22
	
	it from farmers?

23
	A.
	Urn-hum, yes.

24
	Q.
	Is there nicotine in the tobacco when the farmers

25
	
	pull it out of the field and cure it?             [

	Q.
	You mentioned earlier about Reynolds designing     in-

3
	
	consistent product.  With respect to nicotine, do

4
	
	the nicotine levels in the tobacco plants, the

5
	
	various tobacco plants, vary?

6
	A.
	Yes, absolutely it does.

7
	Q.
	Is it just nicotine that varies in tobacco plants,

8
	
	or are there other aspects of the plant that also

9
	
	vary?

10
	A.
	ine wnoie pianc cnemisrry varies.  > o me sugar

11
	
	levels vary.  The nicotine levels vary.  The

12
	
	mineral quantities and concentrations vary,

13
	
	whether, you know, it's calcium, magnesium, et

14
	
	cetera.  The whole plant chemistry can change both

15
	
	from farmer to farmer, region to region, but also  1

16
	
	year to year.

17
	Q.
	And do those variations in nicotine and sugar and \

18
	
	mineral levels and other things you have mentioned \

19
	
	affect how those individual tobacco plants taste   j

20
	
	and whether they are different from other tobacco \

21
	
	plants?                                      \

22
	A.
	Sure.  Yeah.  Absolutely.                         \

23
	Q.
	You mentioned a consistent product.  Why is a

24
	
	consistent product important to Reynolds and to   \

25
	
	smokers?

a.   wen, i mean, a consistent proauct is important

2        because we are a  look, we're a large nationally

3        distributed tobacco company.  People have

4        expectations that when they buy a Winston in

5        Florida, that if they bought a Winston in Colorado,

6        it would still taste like a Winston.  There is a

7        specific taste profile for our brands that sets our

8        brands apart.  And it's important to be consistent

9        because people have an expectation of what a

10                Winston, or a Camel, or a Pall Mall tastes like.

12        trying to make a consistent product given the

13        variations in the chemical makeup of the tobacco

14        plant?  How does Reynolds deal with that issue?

16        Reynolds deals with -- with variability is through

17        crop year variation.  We try to  when we set up

18        our tobacco blends, we try to have several crop

20        cigarette style.  That way when -- if there are big

21        changes in the crop year, you can ameliorate that

22        by having multiple crop years in the blend.

23            The other way we deal with that is through

24        regional diversity.  So it might be that in eastern

25        North Carolina there might be a drought, but there

1        might not have been a drought in Georgia and

2        Florida.  So you might have had a good crop come

3        out of Georgia and Florida, but eastern North

4        Carolina or Virginia wasn't so good.  Again, you

5        might have had a bad crop year in Brazil or a good

6        crop year in Brazil.

8        and bad crop years into your blend so that you can

9        maintain some level of consistency.  So you can do

10        that through crop year variation, as well as

11        regional and global diversity in your  in your

12        blend.

13   Q.   Switching topics, you were asked about

14        de-nicotinized, or nicotine-free cigarettes, and I

15        want to follow-up.  Let's start historically.  You

16        made reference to a conclusion in the 1964 Surgeon

17        General.  What did the '64 Surgeon General's report

21        de-nicotinized cigarettes were not commercially

22        viable period; that they had been tried and they

23        were not desirable or viable.

24   Q.   Okay.  Are you familiar with efforts in the late

25        1980s to bring a cigarette with very, very low

1        levels of nicotine to the market?

2   A.   Sure.  Yes.

J       y    isii us   ano. wnac was nnac producr..  Ano. "sii us

4        about its nicotine yield.

5   A.  Sure.  Phillip Morris put out products called

6        Benson and Hedges De-Nic, also Merit De-Nic, which

7        were very, very low de-nicotinized products.  They

8        had virtually  almost virtually no measurable

9        nicotine in them, but there was some.  They were

10        lower  they were comparable, or lower, to

11        products like Now and Carlton, which were, again,

12        very low-yielding products.  So those products were

13        put out on the marketplace.

14   Q.   And how did those cigarettes with very, very low

15        levels of nicotine do in the marketplace?

17        '64, they were not successful.  They did not --

18        they didn't taste very good.  But they did not do

19        well.

20   Q.   And when the Phillip Morris product was put out in

21        the market in the late 1980s, were they endorsed by

22        the Surgeon General or any other public health

23        entity as being a less-addictive cigarette?

24   A.   No, they were not.  In fact, you know, it's

25        interesting you bring that up because it looks like

1        there are suggestions that we should be moving down

2        this path of de-nicotinizing cigarettes when the

3        public health community, not 20 years ago,

4        lambasted Phillip Morris for putting those products

5        out.  In fact, Matt Myers from the tobacco free

6        campaign -- Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids clearly

7        stated that  felt that it was the most dangerous

8        product on the market.  So it's interesting how the

9        public health community has really done a complete

10        180 on this issue.

11   Q.   And beyond not endorsing them as less addictive, do

12        you know if the Surgeon General or any public

13        health entity endorsed very low, almost no nicotine

14        cigarettes as being safer than normal cigarettes?

15   A.   No one has.  No one has ever  when those products

16        were out on the market, no one has ever come out

17        and said that these products ~ not only  no one

18        from the public health community ever came out and

19        said the products were safer.  They never even

20        suggested that they were less addictive.

21   Q.  Okay.  And moving further forward in time, after

22        Phillip Morris introduced its product and it did

23        not succeed in the marketplace, are you aware of r\a                           3y ot'hPT" ficr^rf^tte formDanies cjiiV'jcicarTiio'n't" t* o 4-Vj-a*-

2
	o. 
	Yes.  In the late 1990s, early 2000s time frame, I  j

3
	
	believe it was Vector, came out with a set of

4
	
	products called Quest, which used genetically-

5
	
	modified tobaccos that didn't produce nicotine and

6
	
	had a series of products that had very low amounts l

7
	
	of nicotine and kind of a dial-down approach to    |

8
	
	almost no nicotine at all.  They were offered on

9
	
	the marketplace.

10
	Q.
	And how did this perform in the marketplace?

11
	n 
	They failed, as well.  Again, they did not -- they

12
	
	were not a commercial success at all.  They were on |

5   Q,   As someone who has  as part of your job

6        responsibility, Dr. Figlar, trying to reduce the inherent risk or cigarette smoking, what is your

8        opinion as to whether a low, or very  no, or very

9        low-nicotine cigarette would be less dangerous for

10        smokers who use their product?

11   A.   Well, I think I -- I think I was -- I think I was

12        pretty clear earlier in expressing the opinion that

13        if people smoke a cigarette that contains tobacco,

14        or really anything else that's an organic matter,

15        and generates smoke and exposes themself to that

16        smoke, it's going to contain carcinogens and

17        toxicants.

18            So if I look at a cigarette that contains

19        nicotine and one that doesn't contain nicotine,

20        when I set them on fire and eXpose myself to that

21        smoke, I am exposing myself to the same amount of

22        toxicants and carcinogens.  So there is no way, in

23        my opinion, that you could look at that and say

24        that it was going to present less risk.

	A.
	IC5 i

12
	Q.
	Tell us about that.

13
	A.
	Reynolds and the other companies have disclosed all

14
	
	of their additives that are used in their products

15
	
	to the Department of Health and Human Services

16
	
	since about 1986.  Of course there are state

17
	
	governments, as well, that require us to disclose

18
	
	our additives:  Massachusetts, Texas, I believe.

19
	
	So we do disclose them to Q^^^^^n state

20
	
	governments, as well.

21
	Q.
	And with respect to disclosures to DHHS since the

22
	
	mid 1980s, what is your understanding of what

23
	
	responsi.Diiir.ies, n any, L/ririo nas ii it s

24
	
	concerned about one of the additives Reynolds was

	using?

1
	r\ 
	My understanding of the disclosure of those

2
	
	additives was that the HHS would warn and recommend

3
	
	

4
	
	they felt that they were a concern.  To my

5
	
	knowledge, that has -- that has not happened.

6
	Q.
	And to your knowledge, has the FDA, since 2009,

7
	
	told Reynolds that it can't use an additive that it

8
	
	is using?

9
	A.
	NO, not that I'm aware of, not to this point.

10
	Q.
	Does every cigarette contain additives, tobacco

11
	
	additives?

12
	
	No, not every cigarette contains additives.

13
	Q.
	Why does Reynolds use additives in some of its

14
	
	cigarettes?

15
	rv 
	For some of the cigarettes there are additives that

16
	
	are used.  There's manufacturing aids.  Of course,

17
	
	humectants, like glycerin, for instance.  But

18
	
	probably the additives that people think of when

19
	
	they think about additives are really around our

20
	
	top dressings and flavors.  And top dressings and

21
	
	flavors are used really to set one brand apart from

22
	
	another brand in the marketplace, and that's

23
	
	typically what they are used for.

1   A.  No, they don't.  They have been, of course, looked

2        at from that perspective and, no, I don't believe

3        they do.

4   Q.   Let's get back to the FDA.  We talked about the

5        FDA  the fact that Reynolds discloses additives

6        and specifications to the FDA, and we mentioned

7        that the FDA has authority over nicotine yields of

8        cigarettes.  What other authority does the FDA have

9        over tobacco products and tobacco manufacturing in

10        this country?

11   A.   Well, the FDA has quite broad powers over tobacco

12        and tobacco products in this country.  They have

14        the products are marketed.  They have authority

15        over that.  They have authority over new products

16        entering the marketplace.  They have authority over

17        what can be said about products.  So if one wants

18        to make a modified risk claim comparing one tobacco

19        product to another, it has to go through the FDA 

20        we have to go through the FDA to do that.  New

21        products have to be approved by the FDA.  They have

22        the authority to come and do inspections of

23        manufacturing facilities.  They can inspect our

24        vendors, and they do inspect our vendors.  So

25        vendors  the whole supply chain really gets

1
	
	can be inspected by the FDA, and has been.  So they \

2
	
	have quite broad powers over the industry,         |

3
	
	frankly.

4
	Q.
	Does the FDA have any authority over product       [

5
	
	standards with respect to the yields of particular  |

6
	
	constituents of cigarette smoke?

7
	*Y 
	They do, and we expect that they will likely make

8
	
	rules or set standards for that.  They have

9
	
	certainly put certain requirements on us to  with I

10
	
	regard to reporting on chemistry in smoke and in

11
	
	tobacco.  So there is - yes, they have those types

12
	
	of powers.

13
	Q.
	And if Reynolds wants to make a modification to one 

14
	
	of its cigarettes that it sells in the market, can

15
	
	it just introduce that in the market without FDA

16
	
	oversight, or no?

17
	Jt\ .
	No, we can't.  We can't make changes to our

18
	
	product.  So we literally cannot make changes to

19
	
	our products without FDA's approval.  So even if we I

20
	
	wanted to do what Counselor Paige was suggesting in \

21
	
	reducing nicotine, we would have to get FDA

22
	
	approval to do that, because that would be a change j

23
	
	to the makeup of the product.

7   A.   Yes.  We have to  RJ Reynolds has had to disclose

8        every  all of RJ Reynolds' research with regard

9        to smoking and health-related information.  So we

10        literally have submitted to the FDA millions of

11        pages of research around smoking and health^related

12        issues anc[ data that we have CQj_j_ec;t:ed around that

4      also the scientific validity of certain of those

6        scientific evidence that would suggest that the

7        messaging that the government wanted us to put on

8        our products was going to accomplish what the

9        government's intent was.

10   Q.   And what was the decision of the trial court, to

11        your understanding, realizing you are not a

12        lawyer?

13   A.   I have read the opinion.  The  the opinion was

14        really quite harsh in favor of the tobacco

16        that our First Amendment rights would be

17        significantly violated, and the First Amendment

18        rights of citizens in general would be violated

19        based on this provision, and that the scientific

20        hurdles were not met by any stretch of the

21        imagination.

22   Q.   And if you know, if that decision in favor of the

23        tobacco companies, including Reynolds, was upheld

24        on appeal.

25   A,   It was.  And it's my understanding that the FDA has

9
	Q.
	Good afternoon, Dr. Figlar.  I have some more

10
	
	questions for you.  You were asked some questions

11
	
	by Mr. Paige about various efforts and reducing    j

12
	
	nicotine or removing nicotine or altering the

13
	
	design of your products.  I want to talk about what

14
	
	RJ Reynolds has actually done with its cigarettes   |

15
	
	and tobacco products.  Okay?

16
	A 
	Okay.

17
	Q.
	You mentioned earlier various techniques that had

18
	
	been implemented into the Pall Mall cigarette to

19
	
	reduce the yields of tar and nicotine over time.    \

20
	
	How did those efforts, if at all, fit into

21
	
	Reynolds' efforts to reduce the risk of cigarette

22
	
	smoking?

23
	A.
	Well, it fits in because it was  it was

24
	
	recognized, and certainly the public health

25
	
	community recommended, that that tar yields be

1
	
	reduced in order to try to address potential

2
	
	concerns around public health.  So by reducing the

3
	
	tar and, consequently, nicotine yields, you are

4
	
	also reducing the amount of toxicants that the

	should, in theory, reduce -- reduce the risk of

8
	
	exposure.

9
	Q.
	And Mr. Paige asked you about the section of your

10
	
	disclosure in this case talking about interaction

11
	
	with the public health community, including the

12
	
	National Cancer Institute.  With respect to the

13
	
	techniques that were introduced  implemented into \

14
	
	Pall Mall, things such as expanded tobacco, and

15
	
	reconstituted tobacco, and papers and filters, in

16
	
	terms of cigarettes that were filtered, do you know j

17
	
	if any government agencies evaluated the

18
	
	effectiveness of those techniques with respect to

19
	
	their effect on the yields of toxicants and

20
	
	nicotine in cigarettes?

7
	numerous reports put out on the results of those

8
	studies.

9  Q
	And you told us that things like expanded tobacco

10
	and reconstituted tobacco reduced the yields of tar |

11
	and nicotine and toxicants.  What conclusions, if

12
	any, did the National Cancer Institute reach with

13
	respect to the effect of those techniques on things \

14
	like tar and nicotine and carcinogens?

15  A
	Well, the National Cancer Institute's reports,

16
	which they put out five reports over that decade,

17
	reported out on those techniques.  And actually

18
	there is a nice tabulated report card that actually I

19
	the Surgeon General published in -- I think it was

20
	the '81 Surgeon General's report, which summarized

21
	the National Cancer Institute's conclusions on the  [

22
	effectiveness of those techniques, and they were

23
	largely positive.

24
	Certain things like expanded tobacco, for

25
	instance, would reduce not only tar and nicotine

	concerns, like PAHs, and then also commented on the j

3
	
	biological activity, the measures that were used;

4
	
	like there was a cytotoxicity measure that was done \

5

	technique, as well as some mouse skin painting that \

7
	
	was done as well.

8
	Q.
	In addition to the techniques that you described

9
	
	that were introduced into the Pall Mall cigarette

10
	
	in the '60s, '70s and 80's, with respect to        I

11
	
	particular constituents, and earlier you were

	talking about nitrosamines, has Reynolds made any  \

	about tobacco-specific nitrosamines and how they

15

	Yes.  There's been                             j

	the late 1960s, early 1970s.  Because LP gas is a   \

24
	
	pretty clean-burning gas, farmers, in order to save \

25
	
	money, were recycling the exhaust gases from LP gas

3
	
	what Reynolds and others had learned, that actually I

4
	
	the reintroduction of exhaust gases in contact with j

5
	
	tobacco increases the amount of nitrogen oxides

6
	
	that the tobacco is exposed to, and because of

7
	
	that, the formation of tobacco-specific

8
	
	nitrosamines in flue-cured tobacco was increased.

9
	
	So what Reynolds actually did was formulate a

10
	
	way for farmers to use an indirect heating method, \

11
	
	along with LP gas, to cure the tobacco, and by

12
	
	doing so, using indirect heat to cure the tobacco,

13
	
	actually reduces, quite substantially, the amount

14
	
	of tobacco-specific nitrosamines that are formed in \

15
	
	cured  flue-cured.

16
	Q.
	And you said that farmers changed over this curing

17
	
	technology in the '60s and '70s; correct?

18
	A.
	Correct.

19
	Q.
	Did Reynolds tell farmers, you should cure your

20
	
	tobacco in this way?

21
	A.
	Using the  no.  It's an  it was an agricultural I

22
	
	practice.

23
	Q.
	Do farmers like it when people tell them how they

24
	
	need to grow and cure their tobacco?

25
	c\ a
	No.  Certainly there was evaluations of the

	Page 204 \

1
	
	tobacco.  I mean, the -- using the recycled

2
	
	exhaust fumes on the tobacco was evaluated by the

3
	
	tobacco companies.  It didn't have an off-taste,    \

4
	
	per se, with the farmers doing that, but we didn't

5
	
	know at that time that that was going to -- and    [

6
	
	the farmers didn't know, that that introduction and \

7
	
	that method would increase TSNAs.  In fact, TSNAs  \

8
	
	really couldn't be measured -- or really weren't

	nitrosamines, to your understanding?               |

16

	On TSNAs, no, not to my understanding.  It wasn't

19
	Q.
	And when did Reynolds make the discovery that it

20
	
	was this direct fire method of curing, flue-cured,

21
	
	that was causing an increasing in nitrosamines?     \

	Page 205 \

1
	
	discovered.  And then, of course, Reynolds

2
	
	investigated the issue and actually provided a     |

3
	
	solution.

4
	Q.
	And I was just going to ask you that.  Did Reynolds \

5
	
	keep its discovery to itself as to what was causing \

6
	
	an increase in tobacco-specific nitrosamines in

1
	
	flue-cured tobacco?                              I

8
	a 
	No.  In this case Reynolds made the discovery      \

9
	
	public knowledge and really shared the practice

10
	
	with the rest of the industry through scientific   J

11
	
	conferences and papers and is today  today it's

12
	
	kind of the standard agricultural practice used

13
	
	today for flue-cured tobaccos in the United        \

14
	
	O ucl Uco *

15
	Q.
	And you mentioned earlier that Reynolds came up

16
	
	with a different way to retrofit the barns to  so \

17
	
	that these exhaust gases weren't  or the tobacco

18
	
	wasn't exposed to the exhaust gases; right?

19
	A.
	Correct.

20
	Q.
	Did Reynolds help farmers convert to this

21
	
	technology that it had developed?                 \

22
	A.
	They did, yes.  I mean, indirect firing is really   j

23
	
	an old school method.  I mean, when you flue-cured \

24
	
	tobacco in the old, old days with diesel fuel or

25
	
	':[

1
	
	try to use that for liquid propane, certain

2
	
	technologies had to be developed and introduced

3
	
	and, of course, that costs money.  And Reynolds

4
	
	did help the farmers convert their barns so that

5
	
	they could use this indirect fire technique with

6
	
	the fuel source that they  that they were

7
	
	using.

8
	Q.
	And by virtue of Reynolds' discovery of both what

9
	
	was causing an increase in nitrosamines and a way  I

10
	
	to fix that problem, what is the state-of-the-art

11
	
	curing method for flue-cured tobacco in the United  j

12
	
	States today?                                     \

13
	A.
	It's indirect heating.                             ?

14
	Q.
	And does Reynolds use any flue-cured tobacco in its \

15
	
	cigarettes that's not cured via indirect heating   \

16
	
	now?                                           \

	Not flue-cured tobacco.                          1

18
	Q.
	Moving beyond cigarettes, are you familiar with the \

19
	
	quiding principle and belief at RJ Reynolds known   

20
	
	as migration?

21
	A.
	Sure.  Yes.                                      (

22
	Q.
	What is migration?

23

5
	
	the least risky form of tobacco use; that we would

	like  we would like to encourage smokers to

7
	
	migrate from using cigarettes to less risky forms

	of tobacco, things like smokeless tobacco, or NRTs,

11
	
	available those products by which cigarette smokers j

12
	
	could migrate to and hopefully find them acceptable \

13
	
	and useful for their purposes.

14
	Q.
	You talked about  I'm SOrry.  Does Reynolds 

15
	
	has Reynolds declared or stated to the public its

16
	
	policy around migration?

17
	A.
	We have.  It's on our website.  We have talked     l

18
	
	about our migration philosophy.                  \

19
	Q.
	Does Reynolds have tobacco products along this     |

20
	
	continuum of risk that you talked about before?

21
	A.
	Yes, we do.

22
	Q.
	Okay.  I want to talk about some of those.  Beyond

23
	
	what we have talked about with cigarettes and

24
	
	Reynolds' efforts on cigarettes, are you familiar

25
	
	with something called tobaccoheating technology?   \

	r\ 
	Certainly.  Yes.

2
	Q.
	Is tobacco-heating technology part of Reynolds'

3
	
	harm reduction approach?

4
	A.
	It is.

5
	Q.
	And it is part of Reynolds' migration strategy?

6
	A.
	It is, yes.

7
	Q.
	Very briefly tell us what the tobacco-heating

8
	
	approach is and as it relates to the potential to

9
	
	reduce harm and move people down the risk

10
	
	continuum.

11
	
	Sure.  Simply put, if you don't burn tobacco, you

12
	
	don't form as many carcinogens and toxicants in the i

13
	
	aerosol stream.  Reynolds learned that if you can

16
	
	that smoke aerosol, is greatly reduced, and we

17
	
	believe may present less risk to a consumer.  So in \

1 0
	
	simple terms that's what heating is.               |

19
	Q.
	And when did Reynolds begin researching tobacco-

20
	
	heating technologies?

21
	A.
	They began in earnest looking at tobacco-heating

22
	
	technologies in the 1980s.

23
	Q.
	Did Reynolds1 research into tobacco-heating        \

24
	
	technology result in any commercial products?      |

25
	A.
	Yes, it did.

	Premier.

5
	Q.
	And how did the chemistry of the smoke from

6
	
	Premier, with respect to be carcinogens and

7
	
	toxicants, compare with conventional tobacco-

8
	
	burning cigarettes?

9
	A.
	It was greatly reduced.  Many of the constituents

10
	
	were greater than 90 percent reduced compared to a  j

11
	
	burned, combustible cigarette.                    1

12
	Q.
	And did Reynolds  to be clear, did Reynolds sell

13
	
	Premier on the commercial market?

14
	A,
	It did.

15
	Q.
	And how did it do?

16
	A.
	Very poorly.

17
	Q.
	Why didn't people like that?

18
	A.
	There is a whole host of reasons why they may not

19
	
	have liked it.  One was  first of all, it wasn't

20
	
	the greatest tasting product in the world compared

21
	
	to a combustible cigarette.  That was a big problem I

22
	
	with it.

23
	
	The other major problem with it was it was    ;;

24
	
	difficult to light.  The product itself doesn't

_ r
	
	burn, and it doesn't burn down, so there is really

1
	
	no indication of when it's done.  So there was a

2
	
	number of issues with Premier.

3
	Q.
	And when was it in the market?

4
	A.
	Test-marketed late 1988 into '89.

5
	Q.
	And after it turned out that people didn't like it \

6
	
	very much, did Reynolds give up on tobacco-heating

7
	
	technology?

8
	/\ *
	No.

9
	Q.
	What did Reynolds do?

10
	A
	What Reynolds did was really saw the  excuse me, {

11
	
	the advantages of tobacco-heating and continued to I

12
	
	work with that technology and alter it to try to

13
	
	make a better prociuct, one that would be more     \

14
	
	acceptable to consumers.                          =

15
	Q.
	And did that research effort seeking to improve on \

16
	
	Premier and improve the tobacco-heating technology I

17
	
	result in any commercial products?                1

18
	A.
	Yes, it did.                                     \

19
	Q.
	Which product?

20
	A.
	A product called Eclipse.

21
	Q.
	And when was Eclipse introduced into the market?

22
	A.
	Eclipse was initially test-marketed in 1996, and   |

23
	
	then went to national distribution in 2000.

	And again, with respect to the chemistry of the

25
	
	smoke, and with respect to the toxicants, how did

8
	
	in this country, in the US, where traditionally

9
	
	it's a fermented-type product.  The Snus  the use \

10
	
	and prevalence of use of Snus in Sweden is quite

11
	
	high, especially amongst men, and it's of great

12
	
	interest because of what's known as the Swedish    \

13
	
	experience.

14
	Q.
	What is the Swedish experience?

15
	A.
	The Swedish experience is over the last 30 years,

16
	
	the use and prevalence of use of Snus in Sweden    J

17
	
	amongst men has basically out-paced the use of     |

18
	
	cigarettes.  So tobacco use, in total, has remained j

19
	
	fairly constant over the last 20 to 30 years, but   \

20
	
	the rates of disease associated with smoking has

21
	
	dramatically dropped.  Sweden enjoys the lowest     \

22
	
	lung cancer rates in all of Europe and much of that

23
	
	is largely attributed to the use of Snus in that

24
	
	country.

	Snus?

14
	
	We are not.

15
	Q.
	Let's move on to another type of product.  You

16
	
	mentioned electronic cicrarettes earlier.  Does

17
	
	Reynolds have any electronic cigarettes?           j

18
	A.
	We do, yes.

	Q.
	And how do electronic cigarettes fit into Reynolds  |

20
	
	harm reduction portfolio and migration strategy?

21
	** #
	Well, if you look at  much like  much like an

22
	
	Eclipse type of product, one can look at the

23
	
	aerosol derived from electronic cigarettes and

^ *t
	
	certainly do a chemical evaluation of that aerosol.

25
	
	We certainly have done that, and our e-cigarettes,

Kress Court Reporting, Inc. - (305) 866-7688 7115 Rue Notre Dame, Miami Beach, FL 33141pgNbr=215

	Page 216 i

1
	when you look at them, which are called Vuse,

2
	V-u-s-e, the aerosol that's generated from those

3
	e-cigarettes is largely propylene glycol, vegetable

4
	glycerin, pharmaceutical-grade nicotine, and

5
	flavors, which is what we put in the  in the

6
	liquid.  So what you get from the aerosol from the

7
	e-cigarette is what we put in the liquid to start

8
	with, in general.

9   Q
	And because you're not burning tobacco in an

10
	electronic cigarette, how do the yields of the

11
	toxicants and carcinogens that are inherently

12
	present in a tobacco-burning cigarette, how does

13
	that compare to what is in the vapor of an

1 A
	electronic cigarette?

15   A
	Well, you really can't find them.  There is 

16
	there might be some chemical decomposition at very,

17
	very low levels, but we have yet to really be able

18
	to see the kinds of things that you see in

19
	burn-down cigarettes.  And even when we - when we

	generates, and in e-cigarettes, it just -- it's

4
	
	very difficult to find anything in there.          j

5
	Q.
	You mentioned a product calls Vuse, V-u-s-e.  Is   I

6
	
	that available commercially today?

7
	t\ .
	It is, yes.

8
	Q.
	And we were talking earlier about Reynolds' We Card \

9
	
	program and efforts to restrict youth access.  What j

10
	
	is Reynolds1 position with respect to whether

11
	
	underage people should use electronic cigarettes

12
	
	like Vuse?

13
	t\ .
	Well, again, our policy is consistent with that of

14
	
	other tobacco products.  We don't believe that

15
	
	youth should use e-cigarettes.  We have put a

	on that.  We believe that, and we support, both,    \

18
	
	from a state legislature perspective, laws that

19
	
	would restrict youth access to e-cigarettes, so 18

20
	
	years and older in order to purchase.  We still    \

21
	
	support possession laws on e-cigarettes just like

22
	
	we would on other tobacco products.  Further, we

23
	
	don't sell our e-cigarettes over the internet, as

24
	
	many other companies do. We don't believe that's

25
	
	the right thing to do.  Certainly that helps to

1
	
	prevent youth access to e-cigarettes.  So there is  [

2
	
	a number of those kind of things that we are

3
	
	concerned about and try to maintain.

4
	Q.
	Is Reynolds telling the public that e-cigarettes

5
	
	are a safe tobacco product?                     \

6
	A.
	No.  We are not saying that.  We don't  we are

7
	
	not making any health claims with regard to

8
	
	e-cigarettes, and we can't.  We know that the FDA  !

9
	
	will exert jurisdiction over electronic cigarettes. \

10
	
	We anticipate that those regulations will be at

11
	
	least similar in terms of the rules with regard to

12
	
	making health claims that you would see on a

13
	
	regular tobacco product.  So no, we are not making \

14
	
	any kind of health statements with regard to       i

15
	
	e-cigarettes.

	With respect to the Zonnic, Reynolds -- or

	Q.
	In what way is Reynolds' approach different?

	Well, we got approval from the FDA to allow Zonnic

	gum to be sold in lower numbers of quantities in a

	pack.  If you buy traditional nicotine-replacement  |

	supply, like a hundred pieces in a kit, which

21
	
	typically costs quite a bit of money, 40 to $65;

22
	
	whereas, the approach that we have taken with our   [

23
	
	Zonnic gum was to package it in packages of 10, so

24
	
	the price point is much lower, so the cash outlay

25
	
	to the consumer is much lower, to see if they can

15   Q.   Last question for you, Dr. Figlar.  With respect to

16        what Reynolds is doing for cigarette smokers, you

17        have made reference to migration.  You have made

18        reference to harm reduction.  You have made

20        and Camel Snus, and Vuse electronic cigarette, and

21        Zonnic nicotine gum.  Are you aware of any other

22        cigarette manufacturer in this country who has a

23        public stated goal of migration and offers

24        cigarette smokers alternatives like RJ Reynolds

25                  does?

1   A.  To the scope and extent that RJ Reynolds does, not

2        that I'm aware of, no.  And certainly I'm not aware

3        of any another tobacco company in the US that

4        offers nicotine-replacement therapies out there and

5        certainly the breadth of the risk continuum in

6        terms of the products that may sit on that risk

7        continuum.  I believe Reynolds offers the widest

8        portfolio of products to help with migration to

9        potentially less risky products.

	response to what was asked of you.  Let me ask you,

8
	
	you brought up this Zonnic gum and the e-cigarrete; \

9
	
	correct?

10
	i\ .
	Yes, I did.

11
	Q.
	Are they manufactured -- are they both manufactured [

12
	
	by RJ Reynolds?

13
	A.
	The Zonnic gum is manufactured by Niconovum through \

14
	
	a pharmaceutical gum manufacturer, Perrigo.  I

15
	
	believe it's called Perrigo.

16
	Q.
	And how about the e-cigarette? And the

17
	
	e-cigarette?

18
	t\.
	The e-cigarette is manufactured by our vapor

19
	
	company.  The cartridge is manufactured in the

20
	
	United States.  The battery is made in China but

21
	
	then assembled here in the US.  The e-juice  or

22
	
	the e-cigarette juice is manufactured by RJ

23
	
	Reynolds here in Winston-Salem.

24
	Q.
	What do you mean the juice?  What is that?         \

25
	A.
	The liquid.  The liquid that goes in the cartridge

	that contains propylene glycol, glycerin, and

2
	
	nicotine.  It's pharmaceutical-grade nicotine that

3
	
	we purchase to make those solutions.

4
	Q.
	I get that.  But you understand that RJ Reynolds

5
	
	manufactures and sell cigarettes; correct?  You

6
	
	know that; right?

7
	A.
	Ye s.

8
	Q.
	And yet you get your tobacco from farmers or other

9
	
	places.  You remember you spoke about that;

10
	
	right?

11
	A.
	We do, yes.

12
	Q.
	So I am just trying to find out if I were to ask   \

13
	
	you, tell me who the company is who manufactures

14
	
	the e-cigarette, who was the company who is

15
	
	responsible for manufacture and sale of the

16
	
	e-cigarette.

17
	A.
	RJ Reynolds Vapor Company, which is part of the RAI \

18
	
	family of companies.

19
	Q.
	Right.  But you understand RJ Reynolds Vapor

20
	
	Company is not a defendant in this case, don't

21
	
	you?

22
	A.
	I do.

23
	Q.
	And RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company is the defendant in [

24
	
	this case; right?

	Q.
	And RAI has -- how many different companies are

	owned by RAI?

3
	A.
	RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, Santa Fe Tobacco

4
	
	Company, American Snuff Company, Niconovum, and RJ

5
	
	Reynolds Vapor, so five.                       \

	Q.
	Okay.  And RAI, you understand that they are not a \

7
	
	dsfsndflnt in this case as well * correct

8
	A.
	I believe so, correct.  Yes.

9
	Q.
	Okay. And the actual  the Zonnic gum is -- so

10
	
	the Zonnic gum and the e-cigarette are not         \

11
	
	manufactured and not sold by RJ Reynolds Tobacco

12
	
	Company, are tney?

13
	A.
	They are not, no, but there is a significant amount j

14
	
	of  I work in RJ Reynolds R&D department.  RJ

15
	
	Reynolds R&D department has service level        \

16
	
	agreements with virtually every  well, with every ;

17
	
	sister company of RAI, and a lot of intellectual   }

18
	
	knowledge comes out of RJ Reynolds Tobacco

19
	
	Company's R&D through service level agreements to \

20
	
	all those RAI companies.  So I am very familiar     {

21
	
	with the products and the work that is done to

22
	
	manufacture those products because we have service  j

23
	
	level agreements and relationship with those

24
	
	companies for those products.

25
	Q.
	I am not saying that you are not familiar with

	them.  I am just wondering  for example, if I was |

2
	
	going to sue  you know, in this case we are

3
	
	asking for punitive damages.  You know that;

	X. -)

5
	i\ 
	r-r"l"lj

6
	Q.
	And if we were to get punitive damages, the

7
	
	companies that we would get punitive damages

8
	
	against would not be RAI or the vapor company.  The \

9
	
	only company who is responsible, or could

10
	
	potentially be responsible in this case is the RJR

11
	
	Tobacco Company; correct?

12
	A 
	Understood, yes.

13
	Q.
	Okay.  So the -- that's all.  I just wanted to

14
	
	know, because I didn't know that RJ Reynolds was in \

15
	
	the business of making a gum, and it doesn't seem  ;

16
	
	like they are.  But there is a company that's owned \

17
	
	by RAI that you have a service agreement with that  |

18
	
	is in the business of making a gum to help addicted

19
	
	smokers quit smoking; right?                      \

1        different products under the RAI holding company;

2        that RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company is actually

3        central to a lot of product development for those

5        agreements and a lot of intellectual knowledge

6        which has been generated over the decades because

7        of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company R & D is being

8        applied at those other holding companies.  That's

9        the connection I'm trying to make with that and the

10        reason why I bring it up.

11   Q.   Okay.  But I had asked you earlier about smoking

z                 climes^ it RJ Reynolds, not RAI, not R  not, you

13        know, this vapor company,  I asked you earlier if

14        RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company sponsored smoking

15        clinics,  Do you remember we talked about that?

16   A.   I do, yes.

17   Q.   So as I understand it, RAI owns RJ Reynolds Tobacco

18        Company; correct?

20   Q.  And RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company -- we don't have to

21        go through it again, but, you know, about  close

22        to 90 percent of their smokers start out as

24        nicotine, and then on your guiding principles,

25        you're telling these smokers that if they want

22
	
	reading Monograph 8, Monograph 13, there is a lot

1
	A.
	Well, I mean, I think, in essence, that would be

2
	
	true, and I guess, you know, by analogy there is

3
	
	disagreement within the National Cancer Institute, j

4
	
	I mean, they are the ones that put out the reports

5
	
	of the Tobacco Working Group in the '70s, so that  j

6
	
	is their opinions.  Those reports are obviously    \

7
	
	widely available, and if they have issued         j

8
	
	monographs later that disagree with their previous [

9
	
	opinions, then they're in disagreement amongst    \

10
	
	themselves, as well, you would have to admit,     I

11
	Q.
	Well, I think the Tobacco Working Group is a whole I

12
	
	other story.  I'd rather  we could be here for a \

13
	
	long time, and I think Dr. Proctor will probably   \

14
	
	explain that to the jury.                        \

	MR. KREINER:  There is no question.      \

	There is no question.                          j

	Now you're interrupting me.  That's okay.  Listen, i

19
	
	You don't need to apologize.  At least you finally [

20
	
	interrupted me, so thank you.                    \

21
	A.
	I'm sorry.

22
	Q.
	Okay.  So -- strike that.

23
	
	But I guess my question is, you would agree

24
	
	that I went through some of the public health 

25
	
	some of the organizations from the public health

1        community that you consider to be leading, and you

2        would agree one of the leading organizations would

3        also include, or would include, the National Cancer

4        Institute, as well?

5   A.   Yeah.  I mean  look, I agree Monograph 8, 13, et

6        cetera, have differing opinions than what Reynolds

7        Tobacco has.  You know, I didn't mean to be too

8        aggressive by pointing out that the Tobacco Working

9        Group is also National Cancer Institute, but it

10        was.  So there have been -- I think it's fair to

11        say that there is a variety of opinions and views

12        around the scientific information with regard to

13        the tobacco and health-related issues; that

14        those  that those opinions and those views have

15        varied over the course of many decades, and so

16        there is a wide variety of information and

17        statements that have been made, both, by public to                     hfalfh r"3ut"hoT"it"ies around { hpcp i coiipc over 11 me

19        I think it's ~ that's very clear, and certainly I

20        point that stuff out in trial and, you know, you

21        guys point to the other things.  I think that's 

22        I think that's fair to say; that there is a variety

23        of opinions out there.

24   Q.  Okay*  But I guess  maybe I wasn't clear.  I

25        guess my point was, the National Cancer Institute

3   A.   I don't know how important it was.  It was

4        certainly talking about that research.  As it

5        turned out, that research was viewed by the BAT

6        researchers as not being very well-conducted

7        research, and they recommended not even attempting

8        to publish that research.  So there is a series of y                 memos around that research and whether or not it

10        would be wise to try to publish this research, or

11        not.  So I have read many of those memos, and it

12        was included ~ or BAT concluded, that the science

13        was not strong enough at all to try to publish the

14        Hippo data and that it was kind of a poorly

15        conducted set of work.  So I'm somewhat familiar.

16        I mean, these issues have come up before.

17   Q.   I see that.  I see that.  Yes.- So in 1963, before

18        the Surgeon General report came out, the internal

19        memos from Brown & Williamson which are  by the

20        way, they are titled  or it says on the top,

21        Strictly Private and Confidential; right?

22                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

23        It's not fair to ask him that without showing him

24                    the memo.

	Okay.  So it says, moreover, nicotine is addictive, j

10
	
	We are in the business of selling nicotine, an

11
	
	addictive drug, and  but cigarettes, we will

12
	
	assume the Surgeon General's committee to say that

13
	
	they have certain unattractive side effects such as j

14
	
	lung cancer.  Do you remember the gist of those

15
	
	statements being made?                            [

16
	i\ .
	I mean, I do -- I do recall reading those

17
	
	statements in general, yes.

18
	Q.
	And then the '64 Surgeon General report did come

19
	
	out the following year where they held that        \

20
	
	nicotine was a habit  well, strike that.         \

21
	
	This memo was not shared with the Surgeon     j

1
	Q.
	So the Surgeon General comes out with a report
	in   \

2
	
	'64.  They say smoking is a habit and smoking
	

3
	
	causes lung cancer; correct?
	

4
	A.
	They do.
	\

5
	Q.
	And following that report in 1964, nobody from
	

6
	
	Brown & Williamson or RJ Reynolds corrected the
	
7
	
	Surgeon General and told them that nicotine was    j
	
8
	
	addictive, did they?
	\

9
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.
	\

10
	A.
	I don't know why they -- necessarily why they
	\

11
	
	would.  I don't know that everyone in BAT, other
	
12
	
	than that  potentially that lawyer, would suggest \
	
13
	
	or believe that it was addictive.  Certainly the    j
	
14
	
	Surgeon General, when making the evaluation as
	to  |

15
	
	whether or not nicotine is habituating or
	|

16
	
	addictive, looked at a whole host of data that
	was \

17
	
	assembled.
	\

18
	
	So I'm not quite sure whether or not a
	\

19
	
	lawyer's statement would have swayed the Surgeon
	
20
	
	General's committee that spent a great deal of
	time \

21
	
	in investigating that issue and looking at all
	\

22
	
	relevant data associated with addiction and
	\

23
	
	habituation.  So, I mean, I think I kind of
	\

24
	
	understand what you're suggesting.  I don't
	:

25
	
	agree.

1   Q.   Well, I'm not  I'm just asking you a question.

2        But you understand the Surgeon General in 1964 was

3        not in the business of manufacturing and selling

4        cigarettes, don't you?

5   A.  No.  But they certainly were in the business of

6        evaluating them and trying to understand what the

7        public health impact was of them and trying to

8        understand what the implications with regard to

9        addiction and habituation were of them, and they

10        spent a great deal of time accumulating, studying

11        and looking at a vast amount of research to render

12        their conclusions.  So that was their

13        responsibility, and they did issue quite a

14        comprehensive and groundbreaking report in '64 with

15        regard to those issues.  That was their

16        responsibility, and they did do that, and they made /                 those evaluations.

18   Q.  Right.  And they did that without the internal

19        research of the tobacco companies, though;

20        correct?

21   A.   That's not necessarily true.  The tobacco companies

22        turned over a great deal of research to the Surgeon

23        General's COmmittee.  That has, of course, been

24        disclosed.  And, of course, if you read the Surgeon

25        General's reports, the Surgeon General thanks all

Kress Court Reporting, Inc. - (305) 866-7688 7115 Rue Notre Dame, Miami Beach, FL 33141pgNbr=240
Page 241

1        the tobacco companies for the amount of research

2        and information that was disclosed to them to help

3        make their evaluations.  So that's not fair to say

4        that they didn't have information from the tobacco

5        companies because indeed they did.

7        the tobacco companies shared all their research on

8        smoking and health to the Surgeon General?  Is that

9        what you're saying?

10   A.   I am not saying they shared everything that they

11        could have possibly had, but they shared a great

12        deal of information as the Surgeon General pointed

13        out in the forward of the report.  I mean, you can

14        read the forward of the report and it thanks all

15        the folks and companies that provided information

16        to them to make their evaluations.

17   Q.   And then after the Surgeon General issued the

18        report and said smoking causes lung cancer, was

19        that opinion embraced and accepted by RJ Reynolds

20        and Brown &  Williamson and American Tobacco?

21                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

22   A.   From a cause and effect standpoint, no, the

24        believe that the amount of data that -- that was

25        collected at that time substantiated a cause and

2
	
	and, in fact, Bowman Gray, who was the head of RJ

3
	
	Reynolds at that time in '64, certainly testified

4
	
	before Conaress and recognized that, yes, there is I

5
	
	statistical association.  The epidemiology exists

6
	
	and it is real; that there is an association

7
	
	between smoking and health, but that that in and of \

	Williamson, American Tobacco, Phillip Morris, the

	Of course.  Yes, I am.

	So the Surgeon General comes out in *64 and says

19
	
	smoking is a habit.  You'll -- RJ Reynolds, they

	And that was an extensive report where they

9
	
	reviewed extensive literature again.  New research

10
	
	had been coming out since 1964, and they were

11
	
	studying whether, or not, nicotine is addictive and I

	its physiological effects that it had on the brain  j

	Certainly there was some in terms of understanding \

17
	
	what may happen physiologically, but the biggest   |

18
	
	change in 1988 is the criteria for establishing    \

19
	
	addiction was changed.  That's pretty clear.  I

20
	
	mean, you can take the two reports and look at the

21
	
	change in criteria.  It's right there in black and

	white.

23
	Q.
	Okay.  I guess  again, you're jumping  you're

25
	
	asking you, are you aware that in 1988, the Surgeon ;

1
	
	General issued another report, this time dealing

	specifically with nicotine addiction.  Are you

3
	
	aware of that?

4
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the prefatory

5
	
	comment that wasn't a question.  Go ahead.

6
	Q.
	Okay.  Let me rephrase it.  Are you aware of the

7
	
	fact that in 1988, the United States Surgeon

8
	
	General issued a comprehensive report exclusively

9
	
	on nicotine addiction?

10
	t\ *
	Yes, I am aware.

11
	Q.
	And in 1964 there was only  how much of the '64

12
	
	was devoted to whether nicotine was addicted --

13
	
	addictive, or not?

14
	A.
	Two chapters.

15
	Q.
	Okay.  And how many chapters in the '88 report were \

16
	
	devoted to nicotine addiction?

17
	A.
	I don't know.  The report was around nicotine

18
	
	addiction.

19
	Q.
	The entire report; correct?

20
	A.
	Um-hum, yes.                                   \

21
	Q.
	Okay.  And in 1988, based upon this report, the

22
	
	Surgeon General publicly declared for the first

23
	
	time that nicotine was an addictive drug and       \

24
	
	nicotine in cigarettes is addictive; correct?

25
	A.
	Tney did.

	Q.
	And at that time RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, Brown I

2
	
	& Williamson and American Tobacco finally came

3
	
	forward for the first time that nicotine was

4

	MR, KREINER:  Objection to the form.

6
	A.
	In 1988?

7
	Q.
	88.

8
	A.
	They did not.

9
	Q-
	You didn't do that, did you?

10
	/i 
	They did not.

11
	Q.
	They disagreed with the Surgeon General; right?    \

12
	A.
	They did disagree, yes.

13
	Q.
	So in '64, when they said it was a habit, you were

14
	
	okay with it, but in '88, when they said it's

15
	
	addictive, you guys disagreed with that for another \

16
	
	12 years; right?

17
	A.
	Well, they did disagree with the changing of       [

18
	
	criteria, because when you change the criteria to

19
	
	what constitutes an addiction, then basically      j

20
	
	everything  every substance can become an        |

21
	
	addiction.  Chocolate is now considered to be      [

22
	
	addictive.  I just read in the British Medical

	Journal, not two months ago, that sugar is         I

	nicotine in cigarettes as the same thing as drugs

6
	
	of abuse like heroin and cocaine.  That is what    |

	Reynolds and Brown & Williamson and the other      j

	tobaccos found objectionable about the Surgeon

9
	
	General's report, was an association that nicotine

10
	
	and cigarettes are basically equated to be the same \

11
	
	thing as heroin and cocaine.  We do not agree with

	statement. Anybody who smokes a cigarette does not

2
	act the same way as a heroin addict does, or

3
	somebody on cocaine.  I mean, it's absolutely

4
	ridiculous to even think about.  And I think most

5
	juries would agree that it's not the same thing.

6
	You know, it's just  to me it's ridiculous.  So

7
	it's --

8  Q
	You think the Surgeon General  you think the

9
	Surgeon General meant that people who smoke

10
	cigarettes are walking around like heroin addicts?

11
	Is that what you really think they meant?  Is that

12
	what you think they meant when you read the report?

13   A
	I think they made that association.  They claim

14
	that nicotine in cigarettes is as addictive as

15
	heroin and cocaine, and I don't agree with that

16
	characterization.  I think it is - if you want to

17
	quit cigarettes, I don't think the withdrawal is

18
	anything like that, trying to withdraw from heroin

23
	for people to quit smoking.  But I just don't

24
	believe it's the same thing as drugs of abuse, like

12
	Q.
	Okay.  Go ahead.

13
	t\  .
	I was simply making a statement that obesity is

14
	
	certainly one of the leading causes of early death

15
	
	in this country.  That is a well-known fact.  And

16
	
	all I was saying with regard to chocolate, is when \

17
	
	you change the definition of addiction, as the

18
	
	Surgeon General did in '88, a whole number of other |

19
	
	compounds fall into that addiction category,

20
	
	chocolate being one of them, caffeine.  A number of ?

21
	
	other substances, sugar, can also fall in that

22
	
	addictive threshold based on that definition.  So I

23
	
	don't appreciate you trying  you know, kind of

	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

5
	
	It's been asked and answered many times today.     f

6
	A.
	That is what I think the CDC suggests, that's

7
	
	correct.

8
	Q.
	How many are dying from caffeine?

9
	A,
	Caffeine, I don't know.  I don't know that any are

10
	
	dying from caffeine, particularly.  I don't believe \

11
	
	that caffeine is a hazardous substance.

12
	Q.
	Right.  So there is a move in our country from the

13
	
	World Health -- from some of these leading health

j. Ti
	
	organizations to make our society safer which would j

15
	
	include and entail either making a safe cigarette

16
	
	or getting rid of smoking altogether; right?

17
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

18
	t\  .
	There are certainly those efforts in both camps.  I j

19
	
	mean, certainly the tobacco companies have tried to \

20
	
	make g^^g^ cicrarettes and the public health

2        I have yet to have anyone present that information

3        to me to comment on.  This is the first time I have

4        heard of that allegation.

5   Q.   Do you know how many tobacco documents there are in

6        the  in the tobacco archives?  Do you know how

7        many there are?

8   A.   There are tens of millions of pages.

9   Q.   So if I were to read every page, and I read 500

10        pages a day, do you know how long it would take me

11        to do that?

17        principles that's now on your website; correct?

18   A.   It is one of our beliefs, yes.

19   Q.  And that consumers have a right to be fully

20        informed is another guiding principle and belief on

21        your  RJ Reynolds' website; correct?

22   A.   Correct.

23   Q.   When was that website -- with these guiding

24        principles and beliefs, when was that launched and

25        made public?

	I'm not sure.  Probably since  I mean, I would

2
	
	have to look it up, but I'm going to say sometime   

3
	
	around '06, '07.  But, I mean, we have had a

4
	
	website with similar type statements at least since \

5
	
	around the 2000-2001 time frame, I'm going to

6

	Yes.

	And so your Guiding Principles and Beliefs, have

12
	
	they changed since Cheeley died, or have they

13
	
	always been the same?

14
	A.
	I mean, they have  they have changed

15
	
	substantively because of the products that Reynolds \

	has developed and worked on and put into the

17

	about that, if you'd like.

18

	Well, my question to you is  I knew you went into

19
	
	great detail with it on cross-examination.  I guess \

	my questions to you are, one, are you aware of it, \

	talked about in cross-examination?

	your job is you're the vice-president of research

	No.  I'm the vice-president of cigarette product    1

	functions that report up to me.

	And one of them is risk reduction; right?

	I am certainly responsible for a lot of risk

	Q.
	But knowing that 400,000-plus Americans are dying

2
	
	every year from smoking, you would agree that the

	Obviously for the people effected, no.  But I      \

7
	
	don't  I don't really agree with your

20
	
	a number of technologies that were implemented

21
	
	into cigarettes that could potentially reduce their j

22
	
	risk had been largely implemented by the --

23

	A.
	Yes, there are.  And, I mean, despite all these     I

	We have not done that, unfortunately.

	company is still making over a billion dollars a   j

	 there's risks associated with it, but we are,

15
	
	yes.

16
	Q.
	Well, you're selling a legal product that close to

17
	
	90 percent of your users are starting as teenagers, J

	it's an addictive drug, and millions of people   j

2
	
	Congress of the United States has at any

3
	
	opportunity the chance to ban that product.  They

4

	be sold in this country under a variety of

	And  you know, Congress  you said Congress      [

9
	
	could stop it at any time.  You know this is a     j

11

15

	Okay.  But the public health community that we have j

16
	
	cited to earlier, they would like to stop smoking  \

17
	
	altogether.  Thats what their  their goal is to  [

18
	
	prevent teenage smoking, and the goal is if you    j

19
	
	prevent teenage smoking, over time smoking will    \

	disappear, or will almost  almost disappear in   I

	our society; right?

 certainly that is the public health community's    \

	putting that message out.  They have been very

	successful in cutting smoking rates down to all

15        Surgeon General's report, at least reviewed it, or

16        parts of it.

17   Q.  And in it they indicate that it's a global epidemic

18        and they are trying to get rid of youth smoking

20   A.  I would presume they would want to do that, yes.

21   Q.  And in the report they cite to the '94 Surgeon

22        General report where it said that report concluded

23        if young people could remain free of tobacco until

24        18, most will never start smoking; right?

25   A,   Perhaps.  I mean, I don't have the report in front

1   Q.   Have you heard that they were considering it?

2   A.   I know it's within the statute that they can 

3        that they certainly have those powers and that

5        point.

6   Q.   You had talked earlier about nicotine itself

7        doesn't cause disease.  Do you remember that?

8   A.   Correct.

9   Q.  You said nicotine itself doesn't cause disease.

10        But you understand that people smoke for nicotine

11        and if you smoke you are exposed to the carcinogens

12        and that's what can cause cancer; right?

13                 MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

14   A.   The exposure to carcinogens and toxicants is what

15        causes disease, correct.

16   Q.   So there have been cigarette companies over the

17        years who have tired to either lower, reduce or

18        de-nicotinize cigarettes.  You spoke about Benson

19        and Hedges and Merit De-Nic and Quest; correct?

20   A.  Correct.  I did, yes.

21   Q.   And you said that they don't taste so good.  Do you

22        remember that?

z>o       /\.   in general, yes 

24   Q.   But you know that for a first-time smoker  when

25        the teenager is trying cigarettes for the first

1        time, they usually report that it doesn't taste too

2        good either; right?

r\ .           1     LIIXIIK-----JL     LIlJLIlJs.    LIldL    o    lall /     ytra.Il.

4   Q.   Okay.  So for somebody who is an addicted smoker,

5        who is already used to the nicotine, the de-nic

6        cigarettes don't taste too good; right?

7   A.   Probably so.  I mean, I just don't -- I don't think

8        the denic cigarettes taste good, because when you

9        de-nicotinize tobacco, you remove a lot of other

10        stuff from tobacco, flavorful compounds in tobacco.

11        So that's part of the issue.  You know, even the

12        GMO stuff, which the plant doesn't produce the

13        nicotine, there is a lot of other alkaloids that it

14        doesn't produce either that are   that are

16        reason why the smoke from Quest doesn't taste good.

17        The balance is disrupted, smoke balance.

18   Q.  Right.  But when you  when a smoker who is

19        addicted to nicotine, or used to nicotine, smokes

20        Quest, they generally reject that cigarette;

21        right?

22   A.   I mean, I think they have.  I  you know, it

23        didn't do well in the marketplace.

24   Q.   And  but when you have a non-smoker  you know,

	nicotine, it's been reported that that can cause

2
	nausea, dizziness, you know, bad taste.  Those

3
	things were reported by non-smokers who try        j

4
	cigarettes for the first time.  Isn't that so?     [

5   A
	I think that's fair, yes.                        [

6   Q
	So when you say that Quest was not commercially

7
	successful, it's obviously not  we can agree it

8
	would not be commercially successful to sell that   [

9
	to an addicted smoker of nicotine; right?          \

1 u   /\
	I mean, I just  look, I don't know all the       j

11
	reasons why it wasn't commercially successful,  I   j

12
	do know that it wasn't commercially successful.  As j

13
	it applies to your theory about whether or not the

14
	presence of nicotine is the  an ultimate

15
	requirement for people to use the product, I would

16
	simply point you to the fact that RJ Reynolds has   j

17
	been marketing Eclipse for many years, which is     \

18
	largely just a nicotine and tobacco volatile       \

19
	aerosol, and it is not popular either.  And the    j

20
	reason for that is because it does not taste       |

21
	anything like a burn-down cigarette and the balance \

22
	of that product is not the same as what would be

23
	expected of a combustible cigarette.

24
	So if your theory that I think I hear you

25
	saying is people only want nicotine, well, there is I

1
	
	products out there that are basically only

2
	
	nicotine.  Eclipse is one of them.  Nicotine gums

3
	
	are another.  A variety of nicotine-replacement

4
	
	therapies are other products that provide nicotine

5
	
	that don't provide a complete tobacco experience,

6
	
	and they aren't that popular either.  So, you know,

7
	
	I just think smoking is -- is a different kind of

8
	
	behavior.  Yes, nicotine is important, but it is

9
	
	not the only thing that's important in a smoking   \

10
	
	experience.

11
	Q.
	How much does your company spend marketing the

12
	
	Eclipse product every year?

13
	t\ .
	Currently not very much because it's  they don't

14
	
	quite know what to do with it.  They certainly have \

15
	
	a variety  or have had a variety of campaigns to

16
	
	try to promote that product.  Currently, right now,

17
	
	it's not well promoted.

18
	Q.
	When was it well promoted?

19
	A.
	Certainly in '96 in a test market it was well

20
	
	promoted.  At various times in the early parts of

21
	
	2000 when we went national it was heavily promoted.

22
	
	Currently it's not.

23
	Q.
	Now in '96 when you test-marketed it, what was the \

24
	
	market that you test-marketed it in?

25
	n 
	I want to say it was in Texas and St. Louis, I

1
	
	believe, were the test markets for Eclipse.

2
	Q.
	Now, did you market it 

3
	t\ 
	I'm sorry?

4
	Q.
	My understanding  my understanding is that you

5
	
	gave a lot of those cigarettes away for free.      \

6

	I don't know that there were free cigarettes given \

	to get used to Eclipse and get converted to the

12
	
	Eclipse brand.

13
	Q.
	Right.  And that was -- my question was, you were

14
	
	marketing the Eclipse to smokers, not to

15
	
	pre-smokers; correct?

16
	A.
	Yeah.  Our marketing efforts were to smokers, yes.

17
	
	Correct.

18
	Q.
	And you talked earlier about nicotine naturally

19
	
	occurring in tobacco.  Do you remember that?

20
	A.
	It is, yes.

21
	Q.
	And you talked about how you can grow tobacco in

22
	
	your backyard and it would have the same -- it     l

23
	
	would have the same addictive drug, nicotine,      \

24
	
	contained within it; correct?

25
	"A
 u 
	Yes.  I mean, tobacco is not the only plant that

Page 273

2        that generates, I think, the most nicotine.

3   Q.  Riant.  And vou know that opium is naturally

4        occurring in poppy; correct?

5   A.   It is, yes.

6   Q.   And you can grow poppy in your backyard and have

7        opium; ^^gh^?

8   A.  Well, I don't know if that's legal to do that, but

9        I suppose, yes, you could.  If you grow  if you

10        grew poppy that creates opium, yes, you would do

11        that.

12   Q.  And you can  cocaine naturally occurs, in coca;

13        correct?

14   A.   Correct.  Yes.

15   Q.  And so if somebody grew coca in their background,

16        they could have cocaine actually occurring;

17        right?

18   A.   Again, I don't know about the legalities of doing

19        that, but in theory, if the conditions were right

20        you could do that, yes.

21   Q.   And the Surgeon General report that you alluded to

22        earlier in 1988 concluded that nicotine, like

24   A.   It does conclude that, yes.

25   Q.   They all occur naturally in these plants, and you

1
	
	can grow them all in your backyard if you wanted

2
	
	to?

3
	A.
	Well, again, aside from the legalities of doing

4
	
	that -- you know, I think you can legally grow

5
	
	tobacco in your yard,  I don't know that you can

6
	
	legally grow coca-containing plants to derive

7
	
	cocaine, just like, at least here in North        j

8
	
	Carolina, you can't grow marijuana in your

9
	
	backyard either, although some states allow you to

10
	
	do that.  But 

11
	Q.
	But that's the point.  But that's the point.  The

12
	
	public health officials  the public health

13
	
	community is trying to make it illegal to have

14
	
	nicotine just like it is illegal to have heroin and H

15
	
	cocaine; right?

16
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

17
	A.
	They are?

18
	Q.
	Well, are they?  Are they -- not illegal, but they

19
	
	are trying to prevent.  I apologize for the        j

20
	
	misstatement.  They are trying to prevent the use

21
	
	of nicotine just like they are trying to  just

22
	
	like the use of cocaine and heroin are prevented;   \

23
	
	right?

24
	A.
	Are they? Because they certainly aren't preventing ;

25
	
	the use of nicotine-replacement therapies.  I mean, [

10
	
	that the public health community is vehemently

	maybe I'm too pragmatic, but I don't know that

	that's going to go away completely.  I think it    I

	Q.
	What is that?

21
	A.
	Yl was a type of breed of tobacco that came from

22
	
	the USDA which had higher amounts of nicotine in

23
	
	that breed, and I believe Brown & Williamson grew

24
	
	some Yl tobacco to include in its brands and to

10
	
	trying to smoke for a certain amount of nicotine,   j

11
	
	if you can provide a cigarette that may yield a

12
	
	higher amount of nicotine relative to the tar, then \

13
	
	you might be on the path for a harm-reduced type   \

17
	
	you remember that?

	And when nicotine yields are leveled  yields are  |

	get the compensation; correct?

6
	A.
	They can.  My understanding of compensation, and

7
	
	certainly this bears out in the marketplace, is

8
	
	that certainly when people switch from a

9
	
	higher-yielding product to a lower-yielding

10
	
	product, that they may take larger puffs or smoke

11
	
	more cigarettes, but typically that behavior is not \

	And I think that bears out in the marketplace

18
	
	nicotine yields and people begin to smoke more,

19
	
	then they go back; right? So that happens.  If you j

20
	
	have somebody who's smoking a half a pack a day and j

21
	
	you lower the nicotine yield, they might go up to a \

22
	
	pack a day, but eventually you're saying over time  [

23
	
	they will go back to a half a pack a day;

24
	
	correct?

25

25
	
	what the compensatory behaviors would suggest with

	Page 285

1
	
	moving from a high-yielding product to a

2
	
	lower-yielding product, and I was simply making the

3
	
	comment that from a consumption perspective*

4
	
	certainly over the last 30 years, consumption has

5
	
	decreased.  So in other words, the number of

6
	
	cigarettes being sold and consumed by consumers has

7
	
	continued to decline since 1982.  That is  that

8
	
	is a fact.

9
	Q.
	Okay.  But would compensation  I think what

10
	
	you're saying is, if you go from a 1 milligram

11
	
	nicotine cigarette, and you lower the yield to .8,

12
	
	the person will come back to the same amount of

13
	
	cigarettes over time.  That's your understanding;

14
	
	correct?  That the compensation is not

15
	
	long-standing; right?

16
	A.
	I think in general that is the case.  I mean, of

17
	
	course, it's not  you know, it's not 100 percent,

20
	
	higher-yield to lower-yield products doesn't 

21
	
	doesn't last.

22
	Q.
	Okay.  So  sir, please.  I'm really  this is

23
	
	like a series of questions and if you want to do it

*L*  ji
	
	this way we can.  I do have a lot of questions in

25
	
	this area, so I'll start again.

	Page 286 ;

1
	
	My understanding, from what you're saying, is

2
	
	when somebody compensates -- if you go from a

3
	
	1 milligram to a .8 milligram nicotine cigarette,

4
	
	they are going to ultimately, over time, smoke the

5
	
	same amount, which is the lower nicotine yield

6
	
	cigarette; correct?

7
	n #
	I think in general that is the case, yes.

10
	
	lower the nicotine again to .6, .5, .4, .3, .2, .1,

11
	
	you're saying over time you can accomplish a

12
	
	cigarette with an extremely low nicotine yield and \

13
	
	people will still smoke the same amount; right?    \

14
	A.
	I think that is feasible.  That is possible, yes.

15
	Q.
	So do you have cigarettes on the market that you

16
	
	have done that with, that you have went from

17
	
	1 milligram down to .8, .7, .6, .5, .4, .3, .2, and j

18
	
	.1?

19
	A.
	Certainly from a machine-smoking perspective we

20
	
	have those  we have put those cigarettes out on

21
	
	the market.  If you look at - I mean, just look at j

22
	
	the Pall Mall brand family.  You have products that [

23
	
	yield very high amounts of tar and nicotine and you [

24
	
	have a gradation that goes down to what would    |

25
	used to be considered ultra-light type yield       j

	products.  Certainly a large number of brand styles I

2
	
	this in country have been designed that way and

3
	
	offer those differing amounts of yield.  So to     |

	have.  So those products have been been available

	on the market.

7
	Q.
	But  so you're talking about yield.  That's not

16
	A.
	I'm sorry.  That was not clear to me.  I did not

	understand what you were talking about.  There is

18
	
	no cigarette that I'm aware of on the market today

19
	
	that has only 1 milligram of nicotine in the rod.   j

20
	Q.
	Right.  But if the compensation is, as you're      \

21
	
	describing it, that over time you will just go back |

22
	
	to a lower cigarette, why don't you do that, market \

	Q.
	And then how many  how many does your lowest

9

10
	A.
	I mean, it's all dependent on tobacco weight, so  \

	tobacco Weight and blend.  So really all your

21        that type of work and suggest  and it's a bit

22        odd because, you know, Dr. Benowitz, for many

23        decades, has not really been an advocate of

24        lowering yields and lowering nicotine in products

25        because he believed that people end up smoking more

10        there's a non-addictive level?  That is a theory.

23        addictive Pall Mall?

	of nicotine in the product is going to -- is going  {

19
	
	have a cigarette with a low level of nicotine that

20
	
	is not addictive, that's no more safe but no more

21
	
	dangerous than the other cigarette but they can

8        that, you know, the product is going to be

10        know, it has been tried.  It has not been

11        successful over many decades.

12            But again, you know, if we are talking about

13        waving our magic wands and this was the actual case

14        then, yeah, I think I could agree with that.  But I

15        just don't know from a pragmatic standpoint that ib                 Lfiat. s a reasonaoxe uning r,o assess.  x Lninx. a

17        reasonable thing to attempt is what Reynolds is

18        doing right now, which is promoting the idea of

19        migrating smokers from using cigarettes to less

20        hazardous forms of tobacco use, including

21        nicotine^replacement therapies.  I think that's a

22        very reasonable pragmatic and intelligent approach

23        to try to alleviate the hazards associated with

24        smoking.

1        times less hazardous for people to use than smoking

6        So Reynolds' position of migration I think is the

7        most reasonable and pragmatic approach to public

8        health issues, and I would hope that the public

9        health community would adopt these tobacco harm

	We certainly sell Camel Snus in Florida.  We

12
	
	certainly sell Eclipse in Florida.  Look, all I can \

13
	
	do is describe to you what the company's strategy

14
	
	is, and the company philosophy, which is to migrate j

15
	
	people from smoking to using less riskier forms of l

16
	
	tobacco.  Have we implemented the strategy fully   |

17
	
	nationwide across the whole risk continuum?   Not   I

1 o
	
	yet, because Zonnic is only in Iowa at the moment.  j

19
	
	But Nicorette gum is there.  You know, Nicorette   I

20
	
	gum is in Florida.  It's not marketed the way, I    \

21
	
	tinnJc  or pacKageci, 1 tninx, m a way that neips

22
	
	smokers per se, but that's what the pharmaceutical

23
	
	companies choose to do, so  but it's there.

24
	Q.
	Well, what are they doing wrong?

25
	A,
	Well, I think I described it to you.  I mean, if

1        you want to buy Nicorette  or certainly,

2        traditionally, if you wanted to buy those

3        therapies, you had to buy multiple months of

4        supply which is a large cash outlay, which is just

5        not how tobacco consumers either buy -- you know,

6        that's not how they buy cigarettes.  Plus the

/                 location or wnere you can ouy nicoLine-replacement.

o                 Lrierapies is not. wnere a nooacco consumer snops,

9                 typically.  Tobacco consumers typically go to a gas

10 40/j&&5**~convenience store and buy one pack of cigarettes a

11        day, or a couple of times a week, and you can't

12        find those products in gas convenience -- you can

13        find Zonnic now because RJ Reynolds petitioned the

14        FDA and got permission to sell Zonnic gum in a

15        10-pack form and sell it in gas convenience stores,

16        which was not allowed before until we petitioned

17        the FDA to do that.  So we went through those

18        regulatory hurdles to do that and to really see if

19        this was a viable model to increase the sales of

20        NRT gums.

21   Q.   Okay.  Move to strike the portions of that that

22        were nonresponsive.  And I think you said in your

23        answer that RJR petitioned the FDA for Zonnic.

	MR. KREINER:

21
	Q.
	Dr. Figlar, I just have a few additional

22
	
	follow-ups.  Let's talk about nicotine.  Is there a \

23
	
	test that you as a product developer, or anyone in  j

24
	
	the world who is working on cigarette design, can  !


	
	run on a cigarette to tell you whether it's more or \

2
	A.
	No.  There is no such test.  1 mean, you can't make

3
	
	a determination about the addictiveness of a

4
	
	cigarette.  Addiction is determined by an

5
	
	individual, not by the product itself.

6
	Q.
	And despite cigarette smoking and nicotine being

7
	
	addictive, can people quit smoking?

8
	A.
	Sure.  Yes.

9
	Q.
	You have talked about the range of cigarette

10
	
	products that have been on the market both

11
	
	historically and today that have included high tar

12
	
	and nicotine cigarettes, medium tar and nicotine

13
	
	cigarettes, low tar and nicotine cigarettes, and

14
	
	even cigarettes without nicotine.  Let me ask you,

15
	
	can, and do, people quit cigarette that have high   \

16
	
	tar and high nicotine?                            ;

17
	ri 
	Yes, they have.                                 [

18
	Q.
	Can, and do, people quit cigarettes with medium

19
	
	levels of tar and nicotine?

20
	n .
	Yes.  Absolutely.

21
	Q.
	Can, and do, people who smoke low tar and low

22
	
	nicotine cigarettes quit?

23
	A.
	Of course, yes.

24
	Q.
	Is there any public health entity out there,


	
	including the FDA or the Surgeon General, that

1
	
	advises smokers to switch to low-yielding tar and

2
	
	nicotine cigarettes because they will be less

3
	
	addictive and easier to quit?

4
	A.
	No.  Certainly not.

5
	
	MR. KREINER:  Those are all the questions I

6
	
	I have.

	FURTHER EXAMINATION

8
	BY
	MR. PAIGE:

9
	Q.
	Doctor, I have just a couple.  You agree that a lot \

10
	
	of smokers we've talked about over the years have

11
	
	quit.  Some were light smokers.  Some were heavy

12
	
	smokers.  But people have quit; right?

13
	A.
	People have quit, absolutely.  Yes.

14
	Q.
	AnH qottip npnnlp  it" pan f aVp fhpni t/p^rc: anH vpayo

15
	
	and many, many different methods of trying to quit

16
	
	before they're successful; right?                  [

17
	A.
	Some people try many times to finally quit.  Some

18
	
	people try on the first time and quit.  It just

19
	
	depends on the individual.                       |

20
	Q.
	Exactly.  Some people are  you could have        j

21
	
	somebody who smokes two cigarettes a day and they  j

22
	
	quit the first time and somebody who smokes a pack I

23
	
	of cigarettes a day and they quit the first time;   \

24
	
	right?                                       1

25
	A.
	It happens.                                     j

	Page 312

1
	Q.
	And you could have people who smoke a pack to two

2
	
	packs a day and it can take them years and years to |

3
	
	quit after many different tries; right?

4
	r\ 
	That is possible, yes.

5
	Q.
	And many people, even after they quit, after years

6
	
	of trying and they quit, they still get sick and

7
	
	die; right?

8
	A
	They can.  The - if you understand the health

9
	
	statistics, certain diseases become very less

10
	
	prevalent very soon after people quit smoking, like

11
	
	heart disease, for instance.  But some diseases

12
	
	take many years before your risk is lowered, and I

13
	
	think ultimately if you look at the data -- for

14
	
	certain diseases, like lung cancer and emphysema, I

15
	
	think the risk never gets back to that low as a

16
	
	non-smoker, gets close, but I don't think it ever

17
	
	equates to those who never use tobacco.  So their

18
	
	risk is always, I think, elevated.

19
	Q.
	KxgnL.  bo you Know tnat tnere are tne smokers wno

20
	
	started as teens.  They become addicted.  Some of

21
	
	them have tried to quit, and some of them have been

22
	
	successful, yet they still die.  You know that that

23
	
	happens to some of your customers; right?

24
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to your form.

25
	
	It's been asked and answered several times today.

1
	A.
	I believe that that is a possibility, yes.

2
	Q.
	And that's what happened to Mrs. Cheeley; right?

3
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

4
	A.
	I'm not sure.  I understand being as that she died

5
	
	of a smoking-related disease at  in her late 50s,

6
	
	so -- you know, again, that's what I know about

1
	
	1:
 Mrs. Cheeley.

8
	Q.
	1 After decades of smoking and after she finally

9
	
	quit, she then got lung cancer and died; right?

10
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.      j

11
	A.
	I believe she quit a couple years before she passed j

12
	
	away, if I remember reading the interrogatories

13
	
	correctly.

14
	Q.
	That's all I have.  Thank you, Doctor.

Chemistry from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  After completing his Ph.D. in                    pgNbr=353
1997, he was awarded a National Science Foundation ("NSF') postdoctoral research fellowship at Auburn University. As an NSF fellow at Auburn under the direction of Dr. David Stanbury, he studied the kinetics of various reactions related to the autocatalytic decay of chlorine dioxide. Dr. Figlar published several peer reviewed articles based on that research.

Dr. Figlar joined Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation ("B&W") in 1999 as an associate research chemist. Upon the merger of B&W and Reynolds in 2004, he joined Reynolds as a Senior Director of Blend Development Technology, Dr. Figlar's career in the cigarette manufacturing business has been spent in Applied Development with particular emphasis on the research and development of cigarette technologies to reduce the inherent risks associated with smoking. He has expertise in new cigarette technology, cigarette design; smoke chemistry; cigarette performance; filter additives; tobacco combustion; consumer testing; and commercial viability. Based upon his professional experience, education, training, knowledge of external and internal literature and personal interactions with other scientists, he is an expert in the areas of cigarette design, construction, evaluation, and performance. A copy of his curriculum vitae is attached as Exhibit A.

Summary of Opinions

Dr. Figlar will testify that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with quality scientific staff, engineers, and technical personnel. Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the investigation of cigarettes, cigarette smoke, the identification and quantification of smoke constituents, the reduction of smoke constituents, and the commercialization of cigarettes with the potential lo reduce the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Figlar will discuss Reynolds's historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

It is Dr. Figlar's opinion that Reynolds has been earnest in responding to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products. He will testify that Reynolds has consistendy investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking and has diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields while substantially adding to it via its own scientific research. He will testify regarding Reynolds's R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. Dr. Figlar will discuss Reynolds's efforts to identify, develop and implement cigarette designs which substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine-smoking methods. Dr. Figlar will also discuss the many successful cigarette designs and technologies developed by Reynolds's scientists that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.

Dr. Figlar will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of more than 5,000 individual chemical constituents, the vast majority of which arc formed naturally as a result of combustion and pyrolysis of the tobacco rod during smoking. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 toxicants that have been identified by various                   ^

governmental and public health entities as carcinogenic.   Dr. Figlar will address Reynolds's                   a>

efforts throughout the decades to implement designs that significantly reduced the yields of                  ^

carcinogens and toxicants in the smoke of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds does not                  "*

add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds's disclosure of the ingredients and additives used in cigarettes on its website, and to the federal government, as well as the stewardship of those additives and ingredients. He will discuss the statements on smoking and health issues communicated on Reynolds's website.

It is Dr. Figlar's opinion that it has been Reynolds's long-time goal to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents that have been associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify that based on the considerable technical obstacles of this goal, scientists and product developers must simultaneously ensure that technologies are feasible from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint and consumer acceptable when implemented in finished products. He will testify that in his experience, more often than not, problems occur in one or more of these areas and trade-offs between technical success and consumer acceptance must be weighed carefully. He will testify that over the years, numerous market introductions by Reynolds that achieved varying levels of technical success in smoke constituent reduction failed to achieve wide-reaching consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such commercial products, including, but not limited to, carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotinized" or ultra-low nicotine cigarette brands, as well as novel products such as Premier and Eclipse.

Dr. Figlar will testify regarding Reynolds's efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in its cigarettes, as well as its responses to public health concerns. He will testify that Reynolds's efforts to reduce *1ar" yields were a guiding principle in the development and execution of product and technologies over the course of many decades.

He may also testify regarding the FTC method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. Dr. Figlar will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, predict smoke intake for any individual smoker. He will discuss the wide recognition in the scientific and public health communities that there is a broad range of smoking behaviors that influence smoke yield and intake. He will note that despite these variations, on average, smokers of low yield cigarettes receive less smoke than those of higher yielding cigarettes. Dr. Figlar will testify that Reynolds does not design its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC method.

Dr. Figlar will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: 1) general reduction and 2) selective reduction. He will discuss the design techniques and technological advances used in general reduction by Reynolds and its domestic competitors that reduce the FTC "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarette smoke to reduce potential exposure to myriad chemical constituents. Hence, general reduction attempts to address risk as a whole, in reference to cigarette smoke, rather than targeting any single smoke component. In discussing general reduction, Dr. Figlar will testify that the cigarette design techniques utilized to reduce FTC smoke yield include: filtration, filter ventilation, high/increased porosity cigarette papers), cigarette paper bum promoters, expanded tobaccos, reconstituted tobaccos, reduced tobacco weight, cigarette rod                   co

length reduction, reduced cigarette density, and reduced rod circumference. Dr. Figlar will testify                   2

about the implementation of various general reduction techniques to reduce "tar" and nicotine                  *

co

OpgNbr=355
yields in Reynolds's cigarettes, including brand line extensions. He will testify that, at all times, the cigarettes manufactured by Reynolds conformed with the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacturing and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at a standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yield.

He may testify regarding the development of specific technological advances used in general reduction, such as expanded tobacco, which was invented by Reynolds and first implemented in the marketplace in the 1960s as a design tool that enabled the development of cigarettes with lower tobacco weight because expanded tobacco reduces rod density. Dr. Figlar will discuss the reductions in FTC "tar" and nicotine yields that accompany expanded tobacco since the amount of tobacco burned is reduced.

Dr. Figlar will discuss the ways in which Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies and how these techniques are used in the marketplace today. In support of such testimony, he will cite to examples such as reconstituted tobacco, which was first used commercially by Reynolds and is now utilized by most tobacco companies globally. He will discuss how reconstituted tobacco inclusion reduces both FTC "tar" and nicotine yields and the limits to the amount that can be utilized in cigarette manufacture due to consumer acceptability. In addition to discussing general reduction broadly, he will testify to the incorporation of these techniques over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Rglar will discuss the modifications that Reynolds made to its products in response to greater consumer demand for lower "tax"' products, coupled with government and public health authorities advocating this approach as a means to reduce the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify how the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds and the domestic cigarette manufacturers have substantially lowered the FTC "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will testify that the sales-weighted FTC "tar" and nicotine yields per cigarette have fallen nearly 60% since the 1950's, from approximately 38 mg "tar" and 2.8 mg nicotine per cigarette to approximately 12 milligrams "tar" and 0.9 mg nicotine today. He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing and launching low "tar" and/or ultra low "tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Figlar will also testify that general reduction decreases the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns. With respect to low tar products, he will also be prepared to address such topics as smoker compensation and Reynolds's research in this area.

Dr. Figlar will testify regarding Reynolds's efforts to address the public health concerns of smoking by means of selective reduction. He will explain Reynolds's work in identifying and quantifying the target compounds of interest and consequently developing technologies to expedite specific chemistry reduction and create products that were commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will also discuss the ways in which Reynolds has been a leader                     gj

in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years, including its                     o)

historic and current efforts, technologies and products, such as carbon filtered cigarettes. Dr.                     ^pgNbr=356
Figlar will testify about Reynolds's commitment to developing technologies and products with the potential to address the risks associated with smoking with the development of "heat-not-burn" products, such as Premier and Eclipse, He may also discuss innovation in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique and products sold by related corporations, including electronic cigarettes (Vuse) and nicotine replacement therapy (Zonnic).

Dr. Figlar will testify that Reynolds cigarettes have been developed and manufactured with recognized statc-of-thc-art methodologies and practices at all times during the last six decades. He may testify about Reynolds's research efforts on alternative or novel cigarette designs, including attempts to modify utar7nicotine ratios in response to requests of members of the public health community, including the U.S. Surgeon General. As part of those efforts, he will discuss Reynolds's interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and others. He will also address Reynolds's efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments for the development of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no governmental authority, public health group, academic institution, scientific establishment or private entrepreneur has ever developed any superior alternative cigarette design, even though the subject has been extensively researched for decades.

Dr. Figlar will testify about Reynolds's efforts to develop novel products such as Premier and Eclipse, as well as its efforts to develop reduced risk products. He will discuss alternative cigarette designs and the lack of consensus among government, scientific, medical and public health communities as to which test, battery of tests or other evaluation approaches should be used to determine if one cigarette design may present less risk than another. He will testify and describe Reynolds's product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Figlar may also discuss studies in smokers by Reynolds, including yieid-in-use and biomarker studies.

Dr. Figlar may testify regarding allegations of nicotine manipulation. He will be prepared to address the topics of smoke pH, "free'* nicotine, and the use of ammonia. He will testify that Reynolds has not manipulated nicotine, altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine, or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will opine that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase mainstream smoke pH or "free nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using the FTC method.

Dr. Figlar may testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding Reynolds's cigarette research and design efforts. He may also offer testimony in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Figlar reserves the right lo amend this disclosure

Harm Reduction

   deducing the diseases and deaths associated with the use of cigarettes serves pubbc health goals and is m the best interest of consumers, manufacturers and society. Harm reduction should be the critical element of any comprehensive public policy surrounding the health consequences of tobacco use.

   Significant reductions in the harm associated with the use of cigarettes can be achieved by providing accurate information regarding the comparative risks of tobacco products to adult tobacco consumers, thereby encouraging smokers to migrate to the use of smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products, and by developing new smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products ^nd other actions,

   Governments, public health officials, manufacturers, tobacco producers and consumers should support the development, production, and commercial introduction of tobacco leaf, and tobacco and nicotine-based products that are scientifically shewn to reduce the risks associated with the use of existing tobacco products, particularly cigarettes.

   Adult tobacco consumers should Have access to a range of commercially viable tobacco arid ntcotine-based products.
