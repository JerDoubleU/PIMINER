8
	A
	Joel Setchell,

9
	Q
	And Mr. Setchell, how are you employed?

10
	A
	I am employed by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

11
	Q
	How long have you been employed by R. J. Reynolds?

12
	A
	I have been employed by R. J. Reynolds since 2004.

13
	Q
	And what do you do there?

14
	A
	I am the senior director over one to one

15
	communications.
	
16
	0.
	Senior director of one to one communications?

17
	A
	That's correct.

	0
	Now is that an actual, is that a department within RJR

19
	called
	one to one communication*?

20
	A
	It is.

21

22
	'04?
	

23

1        A  When I came into R, J. Reynolds, I started as, as  in

2     the business information and research department,

3        Q  Okay. What did you do?

4        A  I was accountable for research as well as analysis.

5        Q   Research of what?

6        A   Research around our programs, looking at data,

7     developing reports.

8        0.   Can you just  I'm just trying to get an idea of what

9    you did. When you said research into our programs, looking at

10    data, I nean, can you tell ne what kind of programs, what kind

11     of data just so I have a better idea for what you did for a

12    living then?

13        A  Sure. As you know, we have multiple programs out in

14     the market place looking at brand performance, looking at sales

15    data, that type of research into how well we're actually doing

16    as a company.

17        Q   so when you were referring to programs, you meant

18    marketing programs?

19        A   Yes.

20        q   And what was the goal of the marketing programs?

21                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form.

22        q   You can answer.

23        A   I was just simply  my accountabilities were to really

24     just look at the data.

25        Q       All right. So you mean you work there doing business,

doing research and you had no understanding of what the goal of the marketing programs were?

MR. BEACH: Hey, excuse me. Let me interrupt, Mr. Socias, if I can for a minute. This deposition is being taken telephonically and it runs the risk thus that you may inadvertently cut off the witness when he's not completed an answer. I'm not sure if you had completed your answer to the prior question or not, g   Oh, I'm sorry if, if I spoke over you and what I'll do

is I'll try and pause and maybe, Mr. Setohell, if you do the

same that will make it a little bit easier and that way we won't

talk over each other.

MR. BEACH: And I'm not suggesting, I couldn't frankly tell, Mr. Socias, whether that occurred or not. But I wanted just to remind the witness that if he hasn't finished an answer, you just need to speak up. Q   That's fine, yeah. Mr. Setohell, are you in mid-answer

somewhere or should I ask the question again?

A   If you don't mind, could you please repeat the

question?

0   Yeah, is it your testimony that you had no

understanding of what the goal of the marketing programs you -

were researching were?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question. A   Sir, the role of that position did not require

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=7
understanding, did not require understanding of the programs per se. It also, I was not involved with the development of those programs. This is simply reporting factual data that was in our system.

Q   Okay. And what -- give roe an understanding, if you would, of the nature of the factual data that you reported.

A  Sales data.

Q   Okay. You were interested in sales increases?

A   I was interested in 

Q   Or decreases?

MR, BEACH: Beg your pardon?

Q   What, what were you interested in learning about sales?

A   I was interested in reporting the facts of what the sales were.

Q  Okay. And is, did you understand that the goal of a marketing program is to increase sales?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A   Well, sir, this is a competitive business. We have multiple com  especially at that time multiple competitors, simply trying to compete against them.

Q   1,1 understand that. And that, that makes makes perfect sense, but let me ask my question again. You do understand, don't you, that the goal of a marketing program is typically to increase sales, right?

A   Sir, that's a, that's a very broad statement. I

WWW.USLEGA1SUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=8
don't 

Q   Okay.

A  That cannot be applied to all situations.

0   Oh. When did you graduate from college?

A   I graduated in 1996.

Q   Okay. And in your entire time in college, did you, did you major in marketing?

A  I did not.

Q       What was your major?

A   Business administration.

Q   Okay. And as part of business administration, you took ome courses in marketing, right?

A   I took one.

Q   Okay. Xn your entire training in college, have you ever heard of a marketing plan whose goal was to decrease sales of the product being marketed?

A   I don't recall.

Q   So in your mind as you sit here under oath, you're telling this jury it's possible that there are marketing programs whose goal is to decrease sales of the product being marketed?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

It's argumentative. It's asked and answered.

A  Sir, I was just trying to answer, I was answering your question. I don't recall what was in the one marketing class I

WWW. USLEGALSUPPORT. COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=9
10

took in the mid-90s.

Q   Okay. What did you do from 1994 through 2004 whan you joined RJR?

MR. BEACH: Objection. Misstates his testimony.

Q   Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you said you graduated in '94. Did I  was it '96?

A   '96, yes.

Q   I'm sorry. I misspoke. What did you do from 1996 through 2004 whan you joined RJR, sir?

A   In 1996 to '97, I attended graduate school.

Q   Did you get an MBA?

A   I did.

Q   Okay. And so you received your MBA in '97?

A   That's correct.

Q   And then what did you do?

A   I worked for Time Warner Cable.

Q   Through 2004?

A   I worked  no. Until December 1998.

Q        Okay. And then what did you do?

A  Then in January 1999, I started with Brown and Williamson Tobacco.

Q   Okay. And how did the shift from Brown and Williamson to RJR occur in 2004?

A   In 2004, there was a merger or acquisition of some nature that brought those two companies together.

1
	Q
	So did you basically keep your same job after the

2
	merger?
	

3
	A
	I did not.

4
	Q
	Did you go to a different position?

5
	A
	I did.

6
	Q
	What had you been prior to the merger position-wise, of

7
	course?
	

8
	A
	Prior to the merger/ I was in Brown and Williamson's IT

9
	department.
	
10
	G
	What were you doing there?

11
	h
	I was responsible for all of the reporting.

12
	Q
	Reporting of what?

13
	A
	Reporting of sales data.

14
	Q
	Okay. How long --to whom would you report sales data?

15
	A
	Good question. It went to various positions within

16
	brand marketing as well as trade marketing.
	
17
	Q
	Okay. Would it be fair to say that the entire time

18
	you've
	been not only with Brown and Williamson, Williamson but

19
	with R.
	J. Reynolds that there are executives in the company

20
	that are very interested in looking at the sales data?
	
21
	
	MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

22
	Q
	Right?

23
	A
	I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?

24
	0
	Sure. Based on your knowledge of R. J. Reynolds,

25
	sir 
	well, strike that. Let me ask it this way. Your main

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=11
12

job is to report sales data, the results of marketing programs to people in the company, correct?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question. Timeframe. 0   Now, today. A  Today? 0.   Yes.

A   No, that is not my responsibility today. Q   Okay. Maybe I misunderstood. I thought you said you ware senior director of one to one communications? A   That's correct.

Q   Okay. And that you reported the results of marketing? A  No, sir. Court reporter, can you read back my answer to the question in 2004?

Q No, we don't, we don't need to, you know, reinvent the atom. Just if I, if my notes are wrong, just tell me. What do you do as senior director of one to one communication?

A   I oversee the operational side of our communications to consumers be that through direct mail, e-mail, et cetera. Q       Okay. And that started in 2004?

No, sir. 2004 is when I started with R. J. Reynolds.

Okay.

This position started in May of 2012.

Okay. So you've only been in this position for a few

A

Q

o opgNbr=12
13

A       That's right.

Q   Okay. And from 2004 to May of 2012, what did you do?

A  2004, as I stated, I was in business information research department, round reporting. In 2000  to the best of my knowledge 2006, I joined the innovations group. And between then and 2012 when I assumed this position, I was in various, in different innovations functions.

Q       What is an innovation group just for someone that's not in the company that has no idea what that means?

A  Well, innovations would be developing new ideas, new products. Most of our focus was on developing reduced harm products.

Q   What do you mean by reduced harm products?

A  Well, as stated in our guiding principles, there is a continuum of risk associated with different tobacco products and our focus was developing products that were lowest risk on that continuum.

Q   And as an MBA, what training did you have in making a determination regarding the medical risks of products?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

Misstates the witness's testimony.

A  It was not within, it was not within that group to make the determination. If indeed those products would ultimately be reduced harm, that would be a decision made by research and development or other scientists in that group.

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=13
14

1        Q   But what was the function of youc group then?

2        A   Simply to develop concepts.

3        Q   A concept of a reduced risk produot?

4        A  Correct.

5        Q   Okay. Can you give ne an example of a ooncept of a

6    reduced risk produot that would not require medical knowledge to

7     conceptualize?

8                 MR. BEACH: Let me just counsel Mr. Setchell that

9        to the extent these questions would seek to divulge

10        information which is competitively or commercially

11         sensitive, you need to let me know because we will have to

12        close the deposition and obtain a protective order before we

13        can continue. If you can answer the question without doing

14         so, please do so. But because of my long objection, you'll

15        now need no doubt the court reporter to repeat the question,

16        Q       Can you give ne an example of what you're talking

17     about?

18        A   Sir, I believe that is competitively sensitive

19    information.

20         Q       Okay.

21                 MR. BEACH: How do you want to proceed, Mr. Socias?

22        Do you want to conclude this deposition?

23                 MR. SOCIAS: That's entirely up to you. I've got

24         other questions to move on to. I mean, I'm not giving this

25        up, but I  let me just move on.

O OpgNbr=14
15

MR. BEACH: All right. Well, to be clear then,

that's  I don't have any  I agree that it makes sense to

move on and we'll go ahead and ask for the Court to enter a

protective order with respect to this deposition. And if

you would then want to reschedule it to discuss other

things, we'll address that at that time.

MR. SOCIAS: All right. Fair enough.

Q  Mow back when you were in the, in the job I think in '04 of reporting information, the results of sales data, how many people were in the department whose job it was to gather the sales data and evaluate from that sales data the effectiveness of marketing programs?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

Q   Okay. Let me break it up. How many people were involved in gathering sales data in this department?

A   Sir, I don't recall.

Q   Well, can you estimate it? Are we talking one or two people or are we talking dozens? Are we talking hundreds?

A  To the best of my knowledge and I'm just giving an estimate, it was probably three or four.

Q   Okay. Now you1re here today as a oorporate representative, correct?

A   That is correct.

Q  And you're here today, you've been designated as a corporate representative with the most knowledge concerning

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=15

4         A   I am here to testify on the subject set forth on

6        Q   Okay. Do you have, do you have that in front of you? 1                  A   I do.

8                  MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Let me just have that marked

9         as  can we mark that as Exhibit 1?

10                  (PLAINTIFF'S EXHIBIT 1 WAS MARKED FOR

11         IDENTIFICATION)

12         Q       Okay. You have Exhibit 1 there, sir?

13         A   Yes, I do.

14         Q   Okay. First category is "Corporate representative with

18         a   Yes, I do.

20         A   I am, I am prepared to discuss the communications sent

21     to Mr. And Mrs. Snow.

22         Q   Okay. And then you've also been designated a corporate

23     representative regarding "documentation maintained by R. J,

24     Reynolds Tobacco Company concerning communications or

25     correspondence with customers including policies regarding the

1    destruction of such records." Do you see that?

2        A   Yes, I do.

3        Q   Okay. Do you know when Mr. Snow died?

4        A  I believe he died in 2006.

5        Q       Okay. So he died before you became the director of one

6    to one communication, oorrect?

7        A   Correct.

8        Q   How is it that you became knowledgeable on the two

9    areas that you've been designated as a corporate representative

10    in, sir? In other words, what did you do to become

11     knowledgeable in that?

12                 MR. BEACH: You can respond to his question.

13        Obviously, I would counsel you that you should not convey

14         the content of attorney-client communications involved in

15         your preparation but generally describe what you've done to

16        prepare yourself.

17        A   I have asked ray staff to identify and retrieve as many

18     records pertaining to Mr. And Mrs. Snow as possible. I have

19     reviewed those records. I have constructed a timeline so that I

20    could accurately explain the information that was sent to you.

21        Q   Okay. Did you do anything else?

22        A   Per part two, the request on Schedule A or the

23    statement on Schedule A was a bit broad, a little bit. The

24    meaning was unclear. I prepared in the context in terms of

25    getting as much information as possible that I could help

1    explain it to you for Mr, And Mrs. Snow. And I have supplied to

2     you a range of our smoking and health litigation policies as it

3    pertains to documents ranging from the mid-1980s until

4     relatively current.

5        Q   Okay.

6                 MR. BEACH: Mr. Socias, while you're waiting for

7         your next question, the court reporter marked the first page B                  of Schedule, of Schedule A with the Exhibit 1 sticker. I'm 9                  assuming you really just wanted that on the notice itself.

10                 MR. SOCIAS:  Yes,

11                 MR. BEACH: We'll correct that on a break,

12                 MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Thank you.

13        Q   Mow as we mentioned one of the areas that you were

14     designated on, sir, was regarding documents produced pursuant to

15     the third request for production.

16                 MR. SOCAS: And could we have the request for

17         production marked as Exhibit Number 2?

18                  (PLAINTIFF'S EXHIBIT 2 WAS MARKED FOR

19         IDENTIFICATION)

20        Q       Do you have Exhibit 2 in front of you, Mr. Setchell?

21        A   I do.

??                  Q   And you see that's dated if you look at page 9, August

23     17, 2012, right?

24        A   Yes, sir.

25                Q       Now in October, we got a CD with some additional

1    documents. Are those additional responsive documents that you

2    found after this response?

3        A   I'm not entirely familiar with this document that was

4     just handed to me.

5        Q   Okay. Well, do you know  are you aware that a CD was

6    sent to my office containing some R. J. Reynolds documents last

7    week?

8        A   Yes, sir.

9        Q   Did you have anything to do with that?

10        A   I  not in sending it to your office. But those

11    documents were, as I mentioned previously, those documents were 3 2          part of the exhaustive search that my staff conducted to locate

13    those records.

14        Q   When did your staff begin the exhaustive search?

15        A   I don't know the exact date. It was shortly, it was

16    shortly after we were, I first received notice. 1*7      Q   And when was, when was that?

18        A   I don't know the specific date, sir.

19        Q   Do you know the general timeframe?

20        A   I believe early September,

21        Q   Okay. And so you began the exhaustive search at some

22    point in September of 2012?

23        A   That's correct.

24        Q   Okay. And you say an exhaustive search. Exactly what

25    did the search entail?

A  Well, as you may have gathered from the documents that were sent to you on the CD, document  because we're dealing really with three different tobacco companies through various mergers, acquisitions, so and on and so forth, some data resides within our existing adult tobacco consumer database at R. J. Reynolds. Some of the information resides in archived systems be it for Brown and Williamson and American Tobacco Company.

Q Okay. In what format does the information reside? In other words, are you looking at computerized records or are you looking at paper files in filing cabinets?

A  Both actually.

Q   Okay. How, did you locate any letters or written communications that Ronald Snow sent to the manufacturer of Pall Mall cigarettes?

A  We located several and there are some exemplars in the files that were sent to you of signature cards that Mr. Snow had completed and sent into the various companies.

Q   Okay. Now you said you sent some exemplars. Did you find things that you did not  that Mr. Snow sent that were not provided?

A   I'm sorry. I don't understand the question,

Q       It may be ~ that's my fault. I didn't ask it clearly. You said you sent some exemplars. Does that mean that you found items that Mr. Snow had sent, communications from Mr. Snow to the manufacturer of Pall Mall that were not provided?

WWW. USLEGALSUPPORT. COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=20
21

A   What, what do you mean by not provided?

MR. BEACH: In other words, did you find 

Q   Tou said you provided exemplars. Does that mean you simply provided some instanoas of communications from Mr. Snow but not all of the ones that you found or did you provide all of the ones that you found?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

Misstates the witness's testimony. He's asking have you not

turned over anything that you found that had  from

Mr. Snow to the manufacturer of Pall Mall,

A   Thank you for the clarification. Everything that was discovered has been submitted and sent to you.

Q   Okay. In that CD?

A  It may be. I'm not exactly sure what was on it, 1/ I did not review what was on the CD.

Q   Okay.

MR. BEACH: In addition, I believe we sent you

records, Mr. Socias.

MR. SOCIAS: Yeah, I'm going to get to that. MR. BEACH: But just then your question was

incomplete.

Q   Oh, okay. This weekend, this Sunday, I got some additional records by e-mail. You know anything about that, sir?

A   I'm aware that some additional documents were

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=21
22

discovered and sent to you,

Q   Okay. And did you discover any of these documents personally or were they discovered by members of your staff?

A  I discovered two of the documents myself.

Q   Which ones did you discover?

A   I discovered a couple of the signature cards or signatures that were sent in by Mr. Snow.

Q       Okay. Now, did you find any, did you make any effort to find any handwritten letters or notes sent in by Mr. Snow?

A   We did,

Q   And were you successful?

A   We were not.

Q   What was R. J. Reynolds policy and, if it changed  let me say, what was the policy of the manufacturer of Pall Mall and if it changed from time to time, tell me the different policies regarding retaining written communications from customers?

A   I am not -- I am specifically prepared today to speak to you about the communications that were sent to Mr. Snow.

Q   Actually, I'm talking about the ones Mr. Snow sent to the manufacturer of Pell Mall.

A I'm not aware, I'm not prepared to speak to the various policies of the various companies in terms of retention of those documents.

Q   Okay.

1                 MR. BEACH: Just to be clear ~

2        Q   If you don't -- sir, I mean, I'm  because you're

3    designated as the individual that's going to testify about the

4    documentation maintained by R. J. Reynolds Tobaooo Company

5    concerning communications Kith customers, including policies

6    regarding the destruction of such records. Now you're saying

7    you're not, you're not prepared to discuss those subjects?

8                 MR. BEACH: Mr. Socias, let trie just interject, if I

9        can. I think, first of all, the witness previously

10        expressed that the second category, the scope of the

11        category, communications and correspondence with customers

12        was broad and ambiguous but that he had brought a collection

13        of memos relating to document retention policies and, and 

14                 MR. SOCIAS: Right. But that wasn't my question.

15        I understand that, but that really wasn't my question.

16                 MR. BEACH: Well, you're --

17                 MR, SOCIAS: My question was very simple. As the

18        corporate representative I'm asking him what were the

19        policies in place regarding what happened when the company

20        received a communication from a customer.

21                 MR. BEACH: Well, to be clear, sir, I mean, look if

22        you want me to be quiet and not interject, I'm happy ~

23                 MR. SOCIAS: I want you to just object to the form,

24         if you have an objection to the form. I don't want to

25        debate my questions with you and I don't want you to coach

2         it's in an improper form, object to the form and let's move

3         on.

4                  MR. BEACH: I appreciate that and I don't want to

5         interfere unduly. I was just trying to help you out because

6         the 

7                  MR. SOCIAS:  Geoff, Geoff, listen. Thanks for the

8         help, but I would rather not receive help from opposing

9         Counsel.

10                  MR. BEACH: Sure. Okay. Fine.

11                  MR. SOCIAS: So let's just move on. The witness

12         can answer the question and I'll live with the answer

13         whatever it is.

14         Q   Do you remember the question, air?

15                  MR. BEACH: I think the court reporter needs to

16         repeat the question.

17                  MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Repeat the last question back.

18                  (QUESTION WAS READ BACK BY COURT REPORTER)

19         Q   Mr. Setchell, can you answer the question?

20         A   Yes, sir. And as I stated previously, I supplied you

21     with a range of our document retention policies from the

22     mid-1980s until relatively current.

23         Q   Right. And you can certainly refer to them. My

24     question is this. Let's say in 1982, if Ron Snow sends a

25     letter, handwritten letter to the manufacturer of Pall Mall,

1     what policy was in place in 19B2 regarding what happened to that

2     letter? What was the policy? And you can refer to anything

3     that you have.

4                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question,

5         A   Sir, I don't believe we  I don't have in front of me

6     the policies of 1982.

7         Q   Okay. For what years do you have policies?

8         A   Well, let me  we have 198*3.

9         Q   Okay. Let's start there. 1984, Ronald Snow sends a

10     letter to the manufacturer of Pall Hall. What's the policy

11     regarding what happens to that letter?

12                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

13         A   I will require some time just to review the document.

14         Q   Certainly.

15         A   Sir, if you'd like to pull up the document, we can look

16     at it together.

17         Q   No. X just, I just, I just would like your testimony 13          so that we can present this to the jury. You're here as a

3 9          corporate representative. I mean, the document will speak to

20    what the document is.

21         A   Very well. I am reading from the RJR document review

22     memo sent August 22, 1984. Paragraph on page, second paragraph

23     on page 2 states that "Executives of departments which are

24     likely to receive and generate documents relevant to the smoking

25     and health litigation must retain all documents until further

notice."

Q  Okay. Now would that policy include a request for coupons?

A  Well, it states that all documents relevant to the smoking and health litigation must retain all documents until further notice.

Q       Right. But a request for coupons doesn't relate to smoking and health litigation, does it?

MR. BEACH: Objection of the form of the question.

Q   Well, within the oonpany, would the company consider a request for coupons a communication regarding smoking and health litigation?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

It calls for a legal conclusion.

Q       You can answer.

MR. BEACH: If you know.

A  Sir, I don't know. I'm not, I'm not an attorney.

Q   Okay.  So you've been designated as the person to testify on behalf of the company regarding document policies, but we really need a  is your testimony we really need an attorney to tell us what those policies are?

MR. BEACH: Objection. Argumentative.

Q   Is that your testimony, sir?

A  My answer to your question was specifically regarding the language in this letter.

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT,COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=26
27

1        Q   Okay. Well, now my question is a little bit different.

2    My question is: What was the policy in place in 1984 regarding

3    what would happen to a letter from a customer requesting

4    cigarette coupons for Pall Mall?

5        A   Based on the policy at the time, if it was relevant to

6    smoking and health litigation, it would be retained.

1                  Q   Okay. And based on the policy at the time, is a

B          request for coupons by the company considered as something

9          related to health litigation, smoking and health litigation?

10                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

11        A   I'm not qualified to answer that, sir.

12        Q   Okay.  So then did the company, back in 1984, did the 33         company have attorneys that decided whether to throw documents

14     in the trash or save them because no one could figure out

15    whether a document related to smoking and health litigation

16    without Counsel?

17                 MR, BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

18        You don't have to respond to that. It's argumentative.

19        q   Okay. At any point 

20                 MR. BEACH: Sir, if you're done with your

21        questions, you know, for this deposition, that's fine. But

22        you're, you're making numerous unduly argumentative

23        questions that are completely inappropriate.

24                 MR. SOCIAS: Well, frankly I think it's completely

25        inappropriate for you to designate a corporate

representative on document destruction policies that says I

need an attorney to figure out what the policies are, but be

that as it may.

MR. BEACH: Then raise it with the Court, sir,

but we don't need to waste this, this 

MR. SOCIAS: No, I don't want to raise this with

the Court at all. I think this is much more effective in

front of the jury. I, I, I'm, I'm satisfied with what he's

doing.

Q       At any point, sir, can you tell me what the policies are, what the policies would be upon receipt by the manufacturer of Pall Malls of a request, a written request for coupons from a consumer?

MR, BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

What policies?

MR. SOCIAS: Regarding what happened to that

written request.

A   I'm sorry, sir. Can you restate the question?

Q   Sure. At any point, and you said you have some policies for certain years. At any point, are you able to testify as to what the policy was regarding what would be done with a written request from a consumer for coupons for Pall Mall cigarettes?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form. What would be

done with the coupon in what respect, sir?

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=28

Q   I'm not asking what would be done with the coupon. What would be done with the written request, what would happen with the communication from the customer, what was the policy regarding that communication? Are you able to tell me for any year, whatsoever?

MR. BEACH: Sir, are you asking whether or not 

you're simply asking 

MR, SOCIAS: Listen, my question speak*? for itself,

I don't want to debate every question with you. If you have

an objection to the form, please object to the form. I'm

not going to sit here and debate my questions.

MR. BEACH; Fair enough. Object to the form of the

question.

A  Well, sir, perhaps, perhaps let me answer it this way. There's a couple of documents that were sent to you that show receipt of communications from Mr. Snow.

Q   Okay.

A   So to answer your question, responses received from Mr. Snow were captured and logged in our system.

Q       Okay. Was there a policy of capturing and logging each and every communication?

A   I am not aware of what the policy was at the time but based upon the exhaustive search that we have conducted to produce documents, it appears that that is the case.

Q  Okay. But you said you don't knew do you know what

A  The policy today is that communications received from consumers are captured in the system. Q   Each and every one? A   Each and every one.

16
	Q
	Okay. So you did not furnish this document to RJR's

A   Sure.

Q   In other words, let me, let me, let's just take it a step at a time. It says COST  ID. Does that stand for customer ID?

A   Yes, sir.

Q   Okay. And then there's a number, 1742031. Is that a specific number that R. J. Reynolds assigned to Ronald Snow as a customer?

A   No, sir. This is from the Brown and Williamson archive.

Q  Okay, is that a specific number that Brown and Williamson assigned to Ronald Snow?

A   Yes, sir.

Q  Did they assign numbers, numbers to all their customers?

A   As far as I know, that would be the case.

Q   Did they keep track of how many, which ones died of cancer?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A   Sir, this is a permission-based database.

Q   Oh, I understand. I'm just  you're -- I mean, since we're talking about assigning a number to each and every customer and all the work that you did looking for documents, did you see any, any records kept by Brown and Williamson or R. J. Reynolds as to which of its customers had died of some type

of cancer?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A  Sir, as I was answering before, this is a permission-based database con 

Q   Right. And now I'm asking a different question.

A  Can I please finish my, my answer?

Q   Certainly.

A  It's a permission-based database which adult tobacco consumers opt in to be, to receive communications from the various companies. The information collected in the database is to ensure that it is accurate and that we can respond to what our consumers ask for.

Q   Okay. Are you through?

A   Yes, sir.

Q   Let me, let me ask you a different question now. In your search for documents and historical documents, have you seen any type of data maintained by the manufacturer of Pall Malls keeping track of which of its customers had died of cancer?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question,

A  Sir, my, my answer is the same as it was to the previous question. It's a permission-based database. Adult tobacco consumers opt in and tell us they want to receive our communications. That is the extent, that is the 

Q   Let's put the database off to the side now, this

2        A  Excuse me. Can I, may I finish my answer?

3        Q   I thought you said you were repeating your prior

4     answer.

5                  MR. BEACH: Sir?

6        Q   I heard it the first two times.

7                  MR. BEACH: Mr. Socias?

8         Q   I'm asking a different question and we don't seem to be

9     communicating, but go ahead.

10                  MR. BEACH: Mr, Socias, you've interrupted the

11         witness twice and you're being impolite.

12         Q   Mr. Setchell, continue.

13        A  What's captured on the database is to ensure that we

14     can respond to what our consumers have asked for and then

15     ensuring that the data is accurate.

16        Q   Okay. Let me know when  are your are you  is that,

17     are you finished?

18         A   Yes, sir.

19        Q   Okay. Now let's lay this permission-based database off 2D          to the side. And my question now is completely different.

21     Based on everything you know about Brown and Williamson and

22     everything you know about R. J. Reynolds, are you aware of any

23     type of data being maintained as to which customers have died or

24     were dying of cancer?

2                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

3         It's beyond the scope of the notice.

4         A   Sir, I am prepared to discuss the communications to Mr.

5     And Mrs. Snow.

6         Q  Are you awar of any records baing maintained by the

7     company that Mr. Snow had neck cancer?

8         A  Based upon the data that we have, we have numerous

9     records of Mr. Snow interacting with various companies. All of

10     his, all of his requests were for coupons.

11         Q   So it is your testimony that the ooinpany has no record

12     of Mr. Snow having neck cancer?

13                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

14         Q   la that correct?

15         A   Sir, I am prepared to answer the questions as laid out

16     in the scope of the document.

17         0.   Okay.

18         A   Regarding  and I'm trying to be helpful in explaining

19     the data that we have.

20         Q       Okay. That's the best answer you can give?

21                  MR. BEACH: Objection. You don't have to respond

22         to that. That's argumentative and rude.

23         Q  Do you know how many coupons were eent to Ronald Snow

24     for Pall Mall cigarettes after he had oanoer?

25         A   I don't, I don't --

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

Q   Do you?

A  Sir, if you want to, if you want to give me a timeframe of  we can discuss which years coupons were sent to Mr. Snow.

Q   Okay. We'll get into that later. Let's continue with Exhibit Number 3, page 9745. First, we have a customer ID 1742031 and I think you said that was a Brown and Killiamson number?

A   Correct.

Q   Was that same number pioked up by RJR after the merger?

A   No, it was not,

Q   Did they assign a different customer number to Mr. Snow after the merger?

A  Those records were never combined. Mr. Snow had contacted the American Tobacco Company in 1990. He had contacted Brown and Williamson in 1998 and he contacted R. J. Reynolds in 1992 requesting to be on those three companies respective databases.

Q   Okay.

A  So, so those records were independent from one another with the except 

Q   Did all three of those companies manufacture Pall Malls?

A   Over time, yes.

Q       Okay.    Now then the, under customer ID it says 1 row.

39

1    Do you know what that means?

2        A  I don't know exactly, but if I were to offer my

3    personal opinion it would be that the records that came back

4     from the archive database are just that one row meaning Mr. Snow

5    did not have multiple customer IDs,

6        Q  Okay. And then the prefix, that would just be whether

7    it's Mr. Or Hiss or Mrs., something that, that type of thing?

8        A   Correct.

9        Q   okay. And then the first name, middle name, last name.

10    What, what suffix? Is that like for a junior or the second or

11    that type of thing?

12        A  Yes, sir. That's right.

13        Q   Okay. And then the address, that would just be the

14     customer's address, correct? City, state and zip code?

15        A   Yes, sir.

16        Q        Okay. And then the phone number. Why did the

17    manufacturer of Pall Hall keep track of the phone number of

18    customers?

19        A   I don't know why it was captured. I don't know if it

20    was ever used.

21        0.   So you would have no way of testifying one way or the

22    other whether personal calls were ever placed to Mr. Snow?

23        A   Based on 

24                                  MR. BEACH:    Objection to the form of the question.

25                A       Based on the records that we have,  there's nothing that

1     indicates that personal calls were ever made.

2        Q   Do you know if there was, but you don't know  do you

3    know what the policies were regarding keeping track of personal

4     calls?

5        A   At that time, I do not know.

6        0   Okay. In fact, you don't know, you don't have any

7    knowledge of the policies prior to you coming in as director in

8    May of 2012, right?

9                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

10        Q   Is that correot, sir? Mr. Setchell?

11        A   Yes, sir.

12        Q   You don't have knowledge of the policies prior to Kay

13    of 2012, correct?

14                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

15        A   I am not aware of what the policies were of American

16    Tobacco Company at this time.

17        Q   Okay. And then gender M that stands for male, oorreot?

18        A   Correct.

19        Q   And DOB, that's date of birth, right?

20        A   That's correct.

21        Q       Okay. And this first page, is this a printout of,

22    like, an initial identification that would appear on a computer?

23        A   Yes.

24        Q   I'm just trying to see how this form came about, how

25    this particular page. Is that a, an initial computer screen

that comes up if you were to punch in Ronald Snow or customer ID?

A  It is. In fact, it's what would be, it looks to me like this would be, like, a flat file, something that's not perfectly formatted. So this, this is -- as you go through the pages, this would be one big readout on a screen that was then subsequently printed.

Q   And then it would have been printed out in different pages?

A  As it is in the exhibit here.

Q   Right. But on the screen, it would all appear as one big page?

A  That would be my, that would be my guess.

Q   Okay. But you personally never saw it on the screen?

A   I personally never saw it. I wasn't aware, I wasn't involved with the creation of this document.

Q   Okay. Now from looking at this initial row, can you tell when this customer ID was assigned?

A  Not from this particular page.

MR, BEACH: The question was the row, not from the

page.

A   Oh, no.

0,   Okay. You're looking 

A   From looking, from looking at this one row, you cannot tell when this particular customer ID was assigned.

Q   Right. And that one row ia the only data appearing on this page, right?

A   That's right.

Q   Okay. So let's go to the next page of Exhibit 3, 9746. Then it says AV, then a line Status and a line ID. What does that mean?

A  That is age verification status ID,

Q   And is -- what does that mean?

A  Well, if you look below there, you see the Number 7.

Q  Yes, sir.

A  That 7 is a code which is related to, if you look at the next column, age verification status description. That 7 is just a code meaning match on century, year, month, day, level.

Q  What does, what does that mean?

A   That tells us that he was successfully age verified based upon his entire date of birth of |_________________against

PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL MATER

a third-party age verification source.

Q   Okay. What was the third-party age verification source?

A   I don't know what was used at that time. Typically, it has been a third-party that has government records, driver's license numbers, financial information, that type of data to verify that that birthdate with that individual is accurate.

Q   Okay. Then it says, there's a line that says Signature CD. What, what is that for?

1         A  That represents that, the Y that you see below that

2     represents that there was record of Mr. Snow's signature.

3         Q   Okay. And then under Deceased, it has N. Does that

4     mean he's not deceased?

5        A  Again, this is, this is an archived system. When it

6     was archived off, that was the latest information that was 1          available.

8         Q   Okay. But I mean, is that what it means that he's not

9     deceased?

10         A   That's right.

11         Q   Kow the next entry, it says Update Date and then it has

12     a date of 5, July, '04. What does that mean?

13         A  That is a system date. That has nothing to do with any

14     responses that we would have received from Mr. Snow. That, that

15     date is reflective of the combination or merger of R, J.

16     Reynolds and Brown and Williamson. So that's the last time that

17     the system itself was updated,

16      Q   Okay. So that, this, that date would relate to the

19    merger of RJR and Brown and Williamson? Is that what  I just

20     want to make sure I understood that.

21         A   Yes, that's correct.

22         Q   Okay. And if this appeared together with the first

23    page, would that indicate to you that RJR kept the same oustomer

24     numbers as Brown and Williamson had previously used?

3        0  We have a customer number that you said had been

4    assigned by Brown and Williamson on the first page, correct?

5        A  That's right.

6        Q  And then the second page which I think you said you

"7         believe actually, you know, appears on the screen together with

8    the data on the first page shows an Update Date of 5, July, '04,

10        A   That's right.

11        Q  Which you said corresponds to the merger?

12        A   Correct.

13        q   Correct. And there's no alternative customer number

14    provided subsequent to the merger other than the original number

15    that had been assigned by Brown and Williamson, aorrect?

16        A   Correct.

n      Q   Okay. Then the next entry is Source ID. What does

18     that mean?

19        A   Well, that's similar to the AV status ID. That is just

20    a numerical code. And if you look to the next column where it

21     says Source Description, source ID was an append processing.

22        Q  What does that mean?

23        A  Well, I'm not exactly sure what the definition is of

24     that, but it looks  if I had to offer my personal opinion, I

25    would say that there were several records that came in

1    particularly his signature card and it was a batch process in

2    which his information, Mr. Snow's information was updated.

3        Q   Okay.

4        A   Or created.

5        Q   And I appreciate your opinion, but I want to make sure

6    that we oan distinguish between what you're prepared to testify

7    as a corporate representative under oath and what you may think

8    or speculate. Are you prepared, are you prepared to testify

9    under oath as a corporate representative for R. J. Reynolds as

10    to what this 26 append processing means?

11                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

12        Mr, Setchell, this is the way this works. You should not

13        guess in responding to Counsel's questions. If you can

14        provide a reasonable estimate or you know something, you

15        know, then you should answer. If you don't know something

16        or you cannot provide a reasonable basis or reasonable

17        estimate for responding, then respond accordingly, okay?

18                 THE WITNESS: Okay.

19                 MR. BEACH: So I think the question is: Do you

20        know what append processing means?

21        A   I do not know for certain what append processing means.

22        Q   Okay. Then the next we have Original Source Date.

23    What does that mean?

24        A  That is the date in which Mr. Snow was added to the

25    American Tobacco Company database.

Q   That was June 1 of 1990?

A   Correct.

Q  Okay. Now was that the day he was added to a computerized database or the day he was added to any kind of oontpilation of data that nay not have been computerised?

A   I'm not aware of what the American Tobacco Company had at that time.

Q   Okay. So there may have been non-computerised information kept regarding Ronald Snow prior to June 1 of 1990. Tou juet wouldn't be aware of it; is that correct?

A  Yes. I don't know.

Q  Okay. And then Current Brand, Pall Mall. That's what this customer smokes, correct?

A  Correct. That's what he stated his usual brand was.

Q   Okay. So far  where does that information come from?

A  Which information are you referring to?

Q   The current brand?

A  Current brand would have been provided by Mr. Snow.

Q   Okay. And he also would have provided going back to the first page, his phone number?

A   Yes.

Q   Okay.

A       And if you want to look at an exemplar

1        A   Okay.

2        q   The next page is 9747, Current Flavor, Non-Menthol. Is

3    that a reference to the Pall Hall that's non-menthol?

4        A   Yes, sir.

5        Q  And then Previous Brand, Unknown, Unknown, Alternate

6    Brands. What's the significance of say Alternate Brand 1 being

7    blank?

8        A  That would suggest to me that no information was

9    provided from Mr. Snow or it was never asked of Mr. Snow.

10        Q   Okay. In other words, the company had no information

11    regarding anything Mr. Snow smoked other than Pall Malls?

12                 MR. BEACH; Objection to the form of the question.

13        Q   Is that correct?

14                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

15        Q   Sir?

16        A   Based upon this record, the only information Mr. Snow

17    provided was that his usual brand was Pall Mall or current brand

18    was Pall Mall.

13      Q   Okay. Now if we go to the next page, I think we're at

20    9748. Are you there?

21        A   Yes, sir.

22                q       Now we got his Customer ID appears again.    And then

23         we've got his Date of Birth again and then there's a Start Date.

24         What is the significance of this page?

25                a       This page would be what's called a brand update page

1     and what this is illustrating is what the company had received

2     in terms of Mr. Snow's brand preferences. So if you see under

3    Start Date 24, April, '98, that is in reference to Mr. Snow

4     completing, signing and sending in a brand update card, opting

5     in to receive communications from Brown and Williamson, And we

6    have a card that may be this one. We don't know for certain

7    because it does not have a current date on it in the documents

8     that you were provided.

9        Q   And I'll get to that later. Were these cards something

10     that Brown and Williamson mailed out to its customers to get

11    updates?

12        A   I'm not exactly sure where these cards that Mr. Snow

13    completed, how he received them.

14        q  Okay. But was it Brown and Williamson's practice to

15     send these out to the customers, to its customers?

16                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

17         A   I'm not, I don't know what Brown and Williamson's

18    practices were at the time.

19        Q   Okay. So however Mr. Snow came to acquire that form,

20     some information was submitted by Mr. Snow on or around April 24

21    of 1998 regarding his brand preference?

22        A   That's correct.

23        q   Okay. Would there have been anything else requested,

24     any other type of information?

1                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

2        A  I'm not exactly sure what, what you meant by your

3     question.

4         Q  Hell/ let me  did R. J. Reynolds or Brown and

5    Williamson or the American Tobacco Company ever try to determine

6    how many cigarettes a day or how many packs a day?

7         A  Well, sir, what I think might be helpful 

8         Q       Let me finish the question, its customers were using

9     their product?

10                  MR, BEACH: Sorry. You, you spoke over each other

11         and the question was garbled. You have to restate your

12         question, please.

13        q   Sure. Did Brown and -- did any -- did the manufacturer

14     of Pall Mall ever make any effort to keep track regarding the

15     frequency of smoking cigarettes, smoking its products that its

16     customers would enjoy?

17         A  Well, sir, what, what I believe will be helpful is if

18     you go through the signature cards that were sent to you, we can

19     look at the information that was requested and that Mr. Snow

20    provided in 1998.

21         Q   Okay. But now without reference to those cards, I'm

22     asking you a different  I'm asking, I'm simply asking you a

23    question. As a corporate representative, are you aware of the

24     manufacturer of Pall Mall keeping track of how many cigarettes

25     or packs of aigarettes a day its customers smoked?

1                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

2        It's outside the scope of the notice. This witness cannot

3        respond to that question as a corporate representative.

4                 MR. SOCIAS: Are you instructing him not to answer"?

5                 MR. BEACH: I'm not instructing him not to answer,

6        but I'm saying it's out of the scope. So anything that he

7        would offer would be purely, would not be as a corporate

8        representative. It would be based on his personal knowledge

9        to the extent that he has any. And you're free, he's free

10        to answer it that way.

11        Q   Mr. Setohell?

12        A  Yes, sir. Could you restate your question again,

13    please?

14        Q   Sure. Does the, to your knowledge, did the

15    manufacturer of Pall Mall ever make any effort to keep track of

16    the frequency of smoking of its customers, in other words, how

17    many cigarettes or packs of cigarettes a day its customers IB          smoked?

19                 MR. BEACH: This question is limited to your

20        personal knowledge, Mr, Setchell, Do you understand? In

21        other words, do you have personal knowledge of the company

22        keeping track of how much consumers smoked?

23        A   In terms of the information collected on our database,

24     i am not aware that that is captured.

2                 MR. BEACH: Again, this question is limited to your

3        personal knowledge,

4        Q   Mr. Setchell?

5        A  Yes, sir. I'm, I'm, I'm thinking. I am aware that

6    there is other research that is collected outside of this

7    database where that, where consumption is captured but not at an

8    individual level.

9        Q   By not  you mean it's not oaptured aooording to the

10    particular name of a particular customer?

11        A   Correct. Overall marketplace dynamics.

12        Q   Okay.

13                 MR. BEACH: We've been going about an hour and 20

14        minutes. Is it a fair time for a break?

15                 MR. SOCIAS: Yes, certainly. How long a break

16        would you like?

17                 MR. BEACH; Five minutes.

18                 MR. SOCIAS; Okay. I'll just stay on the line,

19        I'll put it on mute and then we'll reconvene in five

referenced things like Sample Smoker rather than being specific items sent to Ronald Snow; is that, is that oorreot?

A  Those were, some may say Sample Smoker. Some have other individuals' names on them.

Q   Right. In other words, I just want to make sure because I got the CD rather late in the game and I had other things scheduled last week. I tried to go through it and my staff tried to go through it. But I, we could not find any specific marketing materials, copies of something addressed to Ronald Snow or anyone in the Snow household; is that correct?

A   I'd have to double-check but --

Q   Double-check, if you would. I want to make sure I'm not missing anything.

A  Let me, let me just explain what, what these are that were sent to you. We don't have -- obviously, since what was mailed to Mr. Snow was mailed to Mr. Snow and left our possession, we don't have copies of his particular mailings. What we, what was produced to you are examples of the similar mailers that we have record of sending to Mr. Snow. So this is just for your reference as there's a summary slide as well that indicates what was sent to Mr. Snow, if we have an exemplar of that particular mailing. So that's, that explains the set of documents or partially the documents that you received.

Q   I appreciate that. Let me try and make sure I understand. In the records that you have regarding Mr. Snow, is

1     there some code that specifically identifies what mailers he

2     received or were sent to him?

3        A  There is.

4         Q   Okay. And then the sample mailers that you included in

5     the CD, they correspond, they're the mailers that correspond to

6     the oodes that are entered under Ronald Snow's name for mailers

7     that he received; is that correct?

8         A  That's correct. There's a couple of caveats that I

9    want to make you aware of because there are, these are very

10     similar. If, they might be the exact same ones that were sent

11     to Mr. Snow. If not, they're very similar because there were

12     different versions in terms of coupon values or different offers

13     that were sent into individuals based upon their preferences.

14     So these are just reference example, reference examples but as

15     you stated and we can, on one of the spreadsheets it references

16     the mail file number. That's what was used to identify the

17     piece, that's what corresponds between the piece and what was

18     sent to Mr. Snow.

19         Q   Okay. Now are coupons, were coupons interchangeable

20    between brands of the same company?

21                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

22         a  What do you mean by interchangeable?

23         Q   In other words  name another brand that Brown and

24     Williamson had other than Pall Mall.

25         A   Kool.

Q Okay. Was it possible to use a Kool coupon to purchase Pall Hall or vice versa? Were those ever accepted at the retail outlets in that fashion?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

It's beyond the scope of the notice.

A  I'm not, I can't speak to how retailers might have handled different coupons.

Q  Well, ultimately Brown and Williamson had to reimburse a retailer for the discount, right?

A  Correct.

Q   Right. Did Brown and Williamson allow that kind of interahangeability between your different brands, between the different brands?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

It's outside the scope of the notice. If you have personal

knowledge, Mr. Setchell, you can answer.

A   I'm not aware of how Brown and Williamson handled coupon redemption between different brands.

q  okay. Are you aware of how R. J. Reynolds does it? MR. BEACH: Same instruction.

Q   Sir?

A   Currently, R. J. Reynolds policy is to pay for coupons. Those coupons are only intended to be used for the brand advertised on the coupon.

A  Okay.

Q  And let's see where we left off. Okay. I think we were at page 974B. And 1 don't think this is repetitive. If it is, I apologize. Under Start Date, there's a date of April 24, '98. What does that refer to?

A  That refers to the date in which a  if you recall, we were discussing the brand update cards.

Q   Right.

A  That, that date is the date of when the first brand update card was received at Brown and Williamson from Mr. Snow.

Q  Well, if we go back to page 9746, there's an original source date of June 1 of '90?

A  That's right. That's with the American Tobacco Company.

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A  June 1 of '90 refers to the original source date.

Q   Meaning what?

MR. BEACH; Objection to the form of the question.

A  The original source date is when Mr. Snow was added to the American Tobacco Company database or mailing list.

Q   Okay. And I think we established earlier, I just want to make sure the reoord is clear, you say that's when he was --do you, do you know whether that's when he was added to the computeriEed mailing list or whether he appeared on a non-oomputerized mailing list prior to that time?

A  What the record shows is that Mr. Snow was added to the American Tobacco Company in June 1st, 1990.

Q   Do you know what happened, what was in place prior to June 1st, 1990 as it relates to Mr. Snow and the American Tobacco Company?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question,

A   Those are mail pieces that were sent to Mr. Snow. We have some exemplars of those as well.

Q   It's the one we've been using. It keeps referring to  well, it refers to a response date on all four items. Then the four items are referenced in the next page of, of Exhibit 3, 9750. I want to ask a slightly different question. Was there any record kept to your knowledge when simply out of the blue without responding to anything that the tobaooo company sent out Mr. Snow or any other customer would simply send a note saying can you send me some coupons?

Mr, Snow,

Q   Go ahead, Mr. Setchell.

A  Could you restate the question, please?

Q  Sure. Were there any records maintained, not of responses that Mr. Snow nay have given to items sent to him by the tobacco company, but communications that nay have been initiated by Mr. Snow say such as a letter or a note requesting for discount coupons for Fall Hall?

A  Mr, Snow initiated conversations with various tobacco companies on numerous occasions.

MR, BEACH: No, He asked you does that come in

later pages of this Exhibit 3 that you're looking at?

Q  Okay. Can you identify them for me by Bates numbers? Let me ask you this because I may have some. Are you, are you referring to a, like, a computerized summary of documents? Are you referring to original copies of documents?

A  Neither actually.

Q  Okay. Describe for me the documents you*re referring to and then we will get the Bates number.

A  Okay. The first one would be the Government Relations database record. It says that across the top,

Q   Yes, I have that. Okay. The seoond one?

A  The second one would be across the top says Brown and Williamson Consumer Relation System Phone Contact Center

records.

Q         Okay. I have that.

A         Okay. And the third would be, it looks like a spreadsheet. Across the top, it says RJRT Responses.

Q         It says what?

A       It just says RJRT Responses.

q       Let's see.    I have something  not RJR Archive

A       No,  sir.    There's not 

Q       Would that be part of these documents that we're

2                  MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Do we have a Bates stamp on

3         that?

4                  MR. BEACH; No, sir.

5        Q  Okay. Well, let me see what we've got. I have got

6    everything that was e-mailed to me. I've got -- oh, RJRT

I     Responses and RJRT Call Center Records?

8         A   That's right.

9         Q   Okay. Is that what we're referring to?

10     A  yes, sir.

II         Q   Okay.

12         A  And the fourth would be, it has a date and time at the

13    very top but in the center it says Profile Sign Up Information.

14         Q   Profile, okay. And would that be everything?

15         A   I believe so.

16         Q  Okay. And we'll do these. Let me finish Exhibit

17    Number 3, if I could. And I think I asked you this but perhaps

18     not. At page 9749 under the Converted Date 3/1*7/2003, did you

19    know what that meant? A  No, sir. I do not know what that means.

Okay. Then X think we've covered the next page. Let

me move on to page 9751. Again, we've got four rows, a customer

ID, Ronald Snow, his date of birth and then we have different

extraat dates. What does extract date mean?

21 |               Q

22

23

24

25                  A

Extract date is the date in which the mail file was

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=65
66

1    pulled prior to the mail piece going out.

2       Q   What, what, what does it mean to pull the wail file?

3       A  Well, for these particular mailings like Mr. Snow was

4    part of when the mail file was pulled for this particular, for a

5    particular piece, if you look at the first row on August 1st of

6    2001.

7        q  Okay. And now is this referring to something being

8    sent to Mr. Snow on the date shown in the send date that

9    Mr. Snow sent back as refleoted on item and page 9749?

10       A  I'm sorry. I didn't understand your question.

11        Q   It was kind of a messy question. Let me try again.

12    And we'll do it one at a time. If you look, let's go to page

13    9751.

14       A   Okay.

15       Q   It shows, I think, the mail file was pulled on August 1

16    of '01 and August 2 of '01 something was sent, right?

17        a   Correct.

18       Q   And then it has a tracking code Q121M08910, right?

19        A   0121.

20        Q   I'm sorry, 0121. And that corresponds if you go back

21    to page 9749 to the tracking code for something that Mr, Snow

22    sent in as a response on September 1 of '01, correct?

23               MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

24        Q   Do you see that?

5        A  My knowledge of the coupons that Brown and Williamson

6    used are limited to what I have been able to identify from 1         Mr. Snow.

8        Q       Okay. So do you know one way or the other whether

9    Brown and Williamson used, had coupons that would allow

10    consumers to get a discount on its products without the consumer

11    filling out any identifying information, in other words, just

12    taking the coupon to the cash register and getting a discount?

13                 MR. BEACH; Object to the form of the question.

14        Ma'am, could you repeat the question, please?

15                 (QUESTION WAS READ BACK BY COURT REPORTER)

16        Q   Sir?

17        A   I'm 

18                 MR. BEACHi He's thinking, sir.

19        Q   oh, okay. You know, that's fine. On the phone it's

20    hard to tell whether you're -- take all the time you need.

21        A  Sir, based upon an example that was sent to Mr. Snow 

22    I'm just looking for an example that will help answer your

23    question. There are examples that do not require Mr. Snow's

24     signature on the coupon.

25        q   Okay. So are you aware of any way that Brown and

Williamson would have had to track that?

A   Yes. Yes, I do.

Q  Okay. How would they track it?

A  As you see, as we've talked before the customer ID.

Q   Yes.

A  That was on some coupons. These two that we're looking at here would be the case. That customer ID was tied to those coupons,

Q   How about coupons that would appear in publications? MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question,

Q  Or coupons that would be available at point cfi sales in stores?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

Q  Would there be any way to tie those types of coupons into the consumer using them?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

There's three different questions that have been asked at

this point in time and all three are outside the scope of

the notice. If you have personal knowledge, you can

respond.

Q   Okay. Let me, let me ask it this way. Sir, is this page 9753 a complete and total accounting of every coupon ever used by Mr. Snow to buy Brown and Williamson cigarettes?

A  This page represents those coupons that were redeemed by Mr, Snow that had his customer ID on them.

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=73
MMWMMMMMNI

74

Q   Okay. And any coupons that did not have his customer ID on them would not be reflected on this page; is that oorreot?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

Outside the scope of the notice. If you have personal

knowledge, you can answer.

A  What this data shows us is that these are the two coupons that were redeemed by Mr. Snow.

Q   Okay.

A  For Brown and Williamson.

Q  Limited to only those ooupons that had his ID on there, correct?

A   Correct.

Q   Okay. Now under Outlet Type DESC, is that description?

A   Yes, sir.

Q   Okay. One says 5 drug. Is 5 a code for drugstore?

A  Yes, sir.

Q  And 3 convenience, is that a code for a convenience store?

A   Yes, sir.

Q  And then it says Coupon Value CD and that's blank. Do you know what that refers to?

A  No, sir. It's not blank. It's, there's a 6 for the first row.

Q   Okay. It goes for that line?

A   Yes, sir.

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=74
nmmmmmmmmm

75

1        Q       Okay. What does that mean?

2        a  Six represents the coupon value description that you

3    see in the next column which is one dollar off.

4        Q  So 6 is a code for a dollar off?

5        A  Yes, sir.

6        Q  Okay. And then the 36, is that a code for two dollars 1         off three?

8        A   Yes, sir.

9        Q  Okay. Do you know when Brown and Williamson began to

10    keep track of the redemption of coupons containing customer

11    names?

12        A  Based on the records from Mr. Snow, the first entry is 33         2001.

14        Q  Right. That*s the first entry for Mr. Snow. What I'm

15    saying is do you know when the company began to keep track, keep

16    a record of coupons redeemed by its customers that had customer

17    numbers?

18        A  No, sir. I only can speak to what I have here for

19    Mr. Snow.

20        q   Okay. And if we turn to the next page 9754, is that a

21    continuation of the same type of information?

22        a   It's a continuation of the previous page,

23        Q  Okay. So this would indicate that under Quantity 1 and

24    3 that Mr. Snow bought one pack with one coupon and three with

25    the ethers?

MR, BEACH: Object to the form of the question. Well, what does the 1 mean under Quantity? One means one pack required as for the coupon. And the 3? Three packs.

Okay. And then, then the next entry, I believe it's under Coupon Unit Description. It has 1 Pack and 1 Pack. What

does that mean?

A  Well, the coupon unit, that 1 represents the numerical

code. The description is pack meaning it was a pack  Q   A pack? Coupon.

For 620 cigarettes per pack? Yes, sir.

And then Response Type Description, 1 Single Brand Coupon. It has that entered twice. What is that a reference

to?

A  Well, it's entered twice because it's two separate

rows.

Q   Yeah. What is it a reference to?

A   It's a single brand coupon meaning it's only valid for the brand, one brand that was on the coupon.

Q   Okay. How Encoded B and E. What is that? What does

the E refer to?

Q       Okay.

A  Yes, sir. You had asked me at one point regarding the meetings I had had in preparation of the deposition and 

Q   Yes.

A And I believe I answered incorrectly. The first meeting I had was with Geoff Beach. Also present in that meeting were Cindy Spivey, Mike Leonard and Nancy Montgomery.

Q   And who are they?

A  Mike Leonard is an attorney. Cindy Spivey coordinated pulling, getting the documents together, making photocopies and sending those to you and Nancy Montgomery is my predecessor in my current role.

Q   Okay. Anything else you want to correct?

A  That's all at this time.

Q  Okay, Terrific. Then are we ready to get going? MR. BEACH: Yes.

A   Yes, sir.

Q   Okay. Have you ever been deposed before?

A   No, I have not.

Q       Okay.

MR. SOCIAS: Let me mark, this is to the court

reporter, the document that says Exhibit B, I'd like to

mark that as Exhibit 4. It begins with Bates Number

1                 THE COURT REPORTER: Okay, I can mark this but we

2        did mark something as 4 already,

3                 MR. SOCIAS: Oh, we did? I'm sorry. What was 4?

4                 THE COURT REPORTER: It's Bates number 536730030,

5                 MR. SOCIAS: What is it?

6                 THE WITNESS: It's a direct mail piece. It was an

7        exemplar of one that was sent to Mr. Snow.

8                 MR. SOCIAS: Oh, it's one I had asked to be marked

9        before, okay. I got it. So this will be Exhibit 5 then.

10                  (PLAINTIFF'S EXHIBIT 5 WAS MARKED FOR

11        IDENTIFICATION)

12        Q   Can you identify generally what Exhibit 5 is, sir?

13        A   Yes. Exhibit 5 is the profile report for Mrs. Esilda

14     Snow from the R. J. Reynolds archive system,

15        Q       Now what is the difference between this document and

16    Exhibit Number 3? Let me ask it a different way. For instance,

17     in Exhibit 3 when we're dealing with Ronald Snow, you see that

18    he had in the first page he was assigned a customer ID, oorrect?

19        A  Correct.

20        Q   And that customer ID appeared throughout Exhibit 3,

21     correct?

22        A   Yes, it did.

23        Q   Okay. Now this document for Miss Snow on the first

24    page, it does not say customer ID. Do you know why not?

25        A  As I had mentioned before, Exhibit 3 came from the

Brown and Williamson archive system. Exhibit 5 is from the R, J. Reynolds archive system.

Q  And why would they con* from different archive systems?

A   They were different companies.

Q   Okay. So R. J. Reynolds did not assign customer ID numbers?

A   Based  looking at Exhibit 3, R. J. Reynolds assigned what it called profile ID numbers.

0  Okay. Are you referring to Exhibit 5?

A   I'm sorry. Exhibit 5. Yes, sir.

Q   That's fine. We're on the same page. I just want to make sure the record was clear. Okay. So the profile ID would be like a customer number?

A  Yes. Similar, unique identifying number.

Q       A unique identifying number, okay. Now do you know how R. J. Reynolds came to have Esilda Snow's information as it appears in this exhibit on page 9755?

A   On April 1st, 1994, Esilda Snow was added to the R. J. Reynolds database. Her signature was provided. She was age verified through a third-party and opted in to receive, as to receive communications from R. J. Reynolds,

Q       Where's that information?

A  That is on page Bates number 9755.

Q   Okay. Now where does it say that her signature was provided?

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=80
81

A   If you look toward the right-hand side, there's a label called Signature.

Q       Yes.

A   And under that, it is flagged Y for yes.

Q       Okay. And do you have a copy of her signature, whatever she provided that supposedly had her signature?

A   I do not.

Q  Did you look for it?

A   I did.

Q  Do you know why Mrs. Snow has the, according to R. J. Reynolds, its reoord, has Mrs. Snow at the same address as Mr. Snow; is that right?

A  Both, both Mr. And Mrs. Snow show the address of 6721 Mather Avenue, Orlando, Florida.

Q   Okay. But they have different phone numbers, don't they?

A   Correct.

Q   Did you verify whether both of these numbers were correct or whether one was incorrect?

MR, BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

Q   Well, did you verify the accuracy of any of these phone numbers?

MR. BEACH: Do you mean in preparation for this

deposition or are you talking about within historical  MR. SOCIAS: Ever.

2        Q   Okay. Let's start again. You see it has the phone

3    number for Mr. Snow, correct?

4        A   Yes, correct.

5        Q   You see that, sir?

6        a  Correct, yes.

7        0   You don't know if that's accurate or not, do you?

8        A   Sir, sir, this information comes from an archive

9    system. It's the information that Mr. Snow or Mrs. Snow

10    provided us when they signed up 

11        Q   Okay. Let's go to Exhibit 5.

17         unintentionally I'm sure, you interrupted the witness.

18                 MR, SOCIAS: Oh, I'm not hearing him say anything.

19                 MR. BEACH: Well, it's probably because you're 

20        well, when you start talking and you can hear him talking

21         that might be an indication, but 

22                 MR. SOCIAS: It might be if I could hear him

23        talking, but I don't. I certainly would like to hear his

24         answers. So I wouldn't talk if I could hear him talking.

25        Q   Mr. Setohell, I'm sorry if I cut you off. Go ahead.

MR. BEACH: So let's go back and have the court

reporter repeat the question. It wasn't --

Q   Let me just withdraw the question and start again. Go to Exhibit Number 5, sir. Do you see where it has a phone number that supposedly corresponds to Hiss Esilda Snow?

A  Yes,

Q   Do you have any document that you claim, that R. J. Reynolds claims to have received from Esilda Snow that has this phone number on it?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

0.   Sir?

A   I'm, I'm looking. Sir, what this, what this information represents is the information Mrs. Snow provided when she signed up and opted in to receive communications from R. J. Reynolds.

Q   Okay. How do you know Mrs. Snow provided this information?

A   Based upon this record, it shows that she provided her name, the address of 6721 Mather Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32809 dash 6577 with a phone number of 407-856-999B. That she is a female. Her date of birth is in May of 1946. She was age verified using a third-party, provided her signature and opted in to receive communications from R. J. Reynolds on April 1st, 1994.

3        A  Based upon this data here, again, we received that

6    received from Mrs. Snow?

7        A  We do, we do not have a copy.

8                 MR. BEACH: You should look at the records you

9        have, Mr. Setchell, before you respond to the Counsel's

10        question just to make sure, okay.

11        A   Mr. Socias, this information, this record is from the

12    database. These records, to the best of my knowledge, are

13    complete and accurate regarding Mrs. Snow.

14        Q   That wasn't my question. My question is where is the

15    document that Mrs. Snow, that you believe Mrs. Snow provided

16    from which this information came? And your attorney asked you

17     to look through the record after you said you didn't have it. 16          So I just want to make sure we're clear on that.

19                 MR. BEACH: Counsel, you object to me pointing him

20        to a record that reflects that phone number?

21                 MR. SOC1AS: I, I, I actually I object to you

22        telling him how to answer questions. Yes, I do.

Q   Do you have, do you have the document that Mrs. Snow provided, sir, that you're referring to with this information?

A   This information, this is the record. This is from the RJR archive.

Q  What happened to the document that RJR supposedly received from Mrs. Snow?

MR. BEACH: Objection. Argumentative.

A  We do have record of receiving other information from Mrs. Snow.

Q  Okay. We'll, we'll get to other information later. Let's, let's focus on the information at hand. Where is the document that RJR received from Mrs., that you say RJR received from Mrs. Snow from which the information on this page 9755 came?

A  We were not able to locate it,

Q   Were you able to locate anyone that had ever seen it?

A   No.

Q   You don't know if that document exists, do you?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A   It exists. It did exist at some point. It may still exist today. We were unable to locate it. This information would have not been added to the database without it.

Q   But you don't, you wouldn't, you would have no way of knowing who sent that document in, would you?

MR. BEACH: Objection. It's argumentative.

A  Based upon the fact that it was signed by Esilda Snow and provided all of her personal information required to be on the database including asking to receive coirmunications from R. J. Reynolds.

Q  Well, if I sent a document into R. J. Reynolds and signed Esilda Snow, would you have any way of knowing whether she sent it or I sent it if I put her name and address on it?

A  No, I would not.

Q   So you have no way of knowing who sent in this document for Esilda Snow, would you?

MR. BEACH: Sir, are you asserting that you have a

good faith basis for believing that that's not her, her 

that she didn't do so?

Q  Could you answer the question?

MR. BEACH: Sir, I'm asking you if you have a good

faith basis for the question that you're posing to the

witness,

MR. SOCIAS: Absolutely. Otherwise, I wouldn't be

asking it.

MR. BEACH: Okay. So it's your contention that

mailings were 

MR. SOCIAS: I'm not going to, I'm not going to

debate the case with you. That's it. That's all I'm going

my question now,

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=86
1        A  Sir, if someone committed  at the bottom of the

2     signature, there is a certification statement required. If

3     someone were to essentially misuse Mrs. Snow's personal

4     information and sign even though it says at the signature line

5     that "I understand that giving false information in order to

6     accept these offers may constitute a violation of law,M if

7     someone were to go that far, that's a possibility.

8         Q   Let's go to the -- were to go that far. You mean you

9    would consider that something extreme, if someone would send

10     someone else  would sign someone else's name to get some

11     coupons for cheap cigarettes?

12                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form,

13        Q   You consider that an extreme act, sir?

14         A  I didn't say it was an extreme act.

15         Q  Okay. Certainly not as extreme as selling a product

16     that kills people, is it?

17                  MR. BEACH: That's argumentative. That question -

18         Q   Let me withdraw the question. Let's go to the next

19    page, 9756. What information does this page contain?

20         A  This information is a continue, a continuation of the

21     profile from the previous page.

22         q   Okay. And what does Update Date mean?

23         a   Update date was the last date of interaction in which

24     we received something mailed back by Esilda.

25         Q  Now Source Brand, it says Brand SCR. What does that

mean?

A  Brand screener.

Q   What does that mean?

A  It's similar to the brand signature cards that ask various questions, personal information similar to the one Esilda had submitted to get on the database.

Q       When you say similar to the one Esilda had submitted to get on the database, what, what  the only thing you really know is similar to the information contained on the database, right? You've never seen the document that allegedly was submitted by Esilda, right?

A   Correct.

Q   Okay. Now then it has DM Winston. What does that mean?

A   That was, the mail piece was a direct mail piece. Winston was the brand.

Q   Okay. So that means something was direct mailed to Esilda Snow regarding Winston?

A   No. That means, what that specifically means is that what Esilda responded to and mailed back came from a particular Winston piece.

Q       Okay. So someone sent something back and it had the name Esilda on it and it was a Winston piece?

A   Correct.

Q       Okay.    And then Source Date.    Is that when this

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=88
89

happened, July 18 of 1996?

A   Correct.

Q   And then Usual Brand, Virginia Slims. What does that mean?

A   That means on this form, on this screener, it asked of Esilda what her usual brand is, the brand she buys most often and she indicated that that was, that brand was Virginia Slims.

Q   Okay. Well, actually you don't have that document either, do you?

A  No. We have the database record that indicates the capture of that information.

Q   Okay. That information by whoever sent in the document, correct?

A  That information by whoever mailed it with Esilda's personal information on it.

Q  Okay. Then under UB Style, what does UB Style mean?

A   Style would be  I'm not sure what that means in the context of this because there is no information was provided. So it may 

Q   What does UB mean?

A   I'm sorry?

Q   What does UB, the initials UB?

A   Usual brand.

Q        Okay.    And then the next entry is L10 UB.    Is that what that says or am I missing that?

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=89

w

1        A   I believe that's accurate.

2        Q  What does that mean?

3        A  That stands for last 10 of usual brand.

4        Q  Okay. And then 10 of last 10 purchases. What is  is

5    that again more information that would be on whatever document

6    this information was put on the database from?

7        A  Yes. Esilda answered that of the last 10 purchases of B          cigarettes, all 10 were for Virginia Slims,

9                  Q   Okay. And then it has Second Brand, Marlboro. Do you

10    see that?

11        A   Yes, sir,

12        q  Okay. What does that mean?

13        A  That means Esilda was also asked on this form, do you

14    have  something to the extent of what is your second brand

15    that you buy and she indicated it was Marlboro.

16        Q       Now that's very unusual, isn't it?

17                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

18        it's beyond the scope of the notice.

19        Q   Sir?

20        A   It's the information that Esilda provided.

21        Q   That wasn't my question. My question is that's very

22    unusual, isn't it?

23                 MR. BEACH: Same objection.

24        Q   This person smoked Virginia Slims and has a secondary

25    brand of Marlboro. Isn't that highly unusual?

MR. BEACH: Same objection,

A   Sir, I'm trying to be helpful in explaining what this data says.

Q   yes, sir, and I appreciate that. And now my question is different than what the data says. I'm asking you if this is something that's highly unusual?

MR. BEACH: Same objection and instructions. It's

beyond the scope of the notice,

Q   Sir?

A  Sir, I'm not going to judge Esilda. She told us that these were her preferences.

Q   I'm not asking you to judge Esilda. I'm saying based  you work for R. J, Reynolds and based on everything you know about R. J. Reynolds and its products, isn't it unusual for someone whose primary brand is Virginia Slims to have a secondary brand of Marlboro?

MR. BEACH: I object to the form of the

MR. BEACH: I object to the form

MR. BEACH: I object to the form of the question to

Snow, they are outside the scope of the notice. And, Mr.

Setchell, if you have personal knowledge  you're not

responding to this question as a corporate representative,

1         If you have personal knowledge as to whether or not it is

2         highly unusual for a person to both smoke Virginia Slims and

3        Marlboro, you may respond.

4                  MR. SOCIAS: Please don't, don't reword my question

5        and I would ask you to look again at what the designation of

6         the corporate representative is. It's much broader than Mr.

7         And Mrs. Snow.

8                  MR. BEACH: No, sir. I'm familiar with the scope

9         of the notice.

10                  MR. SOCIAS: Terrific. Why don't we let the

11         witness answer my question?

12                  MR. BEACH; Well, you actually asked it 

13                  MR, SOCIAS: And if the court reporter would read

14         it back, we'll do that.

15                  MR. BEACH: You actually asked the question two

16         different ways. You said highly unusual and you said the 1*7                   second time you asked it, you said unusual. So I used the

18         formulation of your last pending version of the question,

19         sir.

20                  MR. SOCIAS: Why don't you have the court reporter

MR. BEACH: Wait. Hang on, Joel. Sir, don't argue with the witness, number one.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Well, how about if he just answers my question?

MR. SOCIAS: And not raise your objection, outside the scope. Come on. That's an answer to a question?

MR. BEACH: Wait a second, please, sir. You need to stop arguing with the witness.

Number two, Mr. Setchell, please try to answer his question. But bear in mind that you're answering based upon your personal knowledge and your personal experience not on behalf as a corporate representative, okay. So think about what you know and if you can answer his question, please do so.

MR. SOCIAS: Yeah. And I don't want to leave this unsaid. Twice you've accused me of being rude which is completely inaccurate. I have treated this witness

MR. SOCIAS: No, listen. We're not going to agree so let's just not debate it anymore. I just didn't want you to keep accusing me of being rude and me not to respond.

MR. BEACH: Well, you're entitled to respond. But I would like it to be clear for the record that your tone of voice has in fact been aggressive. You have been impolite and you've asked blatantly improper, argumentative questions. You know it and I know it. That's the way you choose to conduct your deposition so be it. But it doesn't speak well of the way you practice. And I would just ask that you try to modify your approach for the remainder of this deposition.

MR. SOCIAS: Quit commenting on my deposition style or my personality or how I ask questions. I have treated this witness professionally and I really  we don't, we don't need to keep going back and forth. It's just cluttering the record.

MR. BEACH: Do you have the question in mind? THE WITNESS: Yes.

MR. BEACH; Okay. Go ahead and respond to the question.

A   Sir, I cannot tell you one way or the other if this is, to answer your question, unusual. Q  Okay.

A   Marlboro, Marlboro is the largest brand in the country. It would not be beyond reason to think that it would be Mrs. Snow's second brand.

Q   Okay. Describe the * well, Virginia Slim is a light woman's cigarette, is it not?

based upon your personal knowledge, please feel free to do

A  This page 9758 represents coupons that were redeemed that had been sent to Esilda and there is no, according to this data, Esilda did not redeem any of the coupons that were sent to her.

A   These are the records we show for Esilda from the point in which she signed up on the database.

Q   Right.

A  Until the last thing we mailed to Esilda was May 5th, 1998.

Q   Okay. And not one was ever redeemed?

A   No coupons were redeemed.

Q   Okay. Now do you have any documents, that, that  does R. J. Reynolds have any documents that purport to have Esilda Snow's handwriting or signature?

A  Yes, we have a document with Esilda's signature.

Q   Okay. Let's see if we can identify that. Can you tell me what the document is?

A  Sure. It's two pages. The first page would say How To Get Your $50 US Savings Bond.

0,  Let's see. Do you have a  I think I have --

A   It was, it's probably something that was -* MR. BKACH: There's no question pending.

0   What I have  I think, if we're looking at the same document, does it say Consumer Details and then it has Consumer Data, Snow, Ronald and then it says For future savings, complete this form and then the next page says Official Order Form Side 1 - How To Get Your $50 US Savings Bond?

A  That's it.

Q       Okay.    And then there's an address here Mr. Renal.

What is that, an S that's crossed out?

Q  Who handwrote in Mr. Ronald Snow? Was that something that RJR did?

A  No. If you look above that address box, the instructions on this state to check the name and address information below to make sure it's correct, make necessary changes in the space to the right of the box.

0.   Okay. So who, who filled in Mr. Renal 8?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

Q   Who typed that out?

A   I don't know who typed it out.

Q       Well, is this, is this an R. J. Reynolds document?

A  No, sir. This is the American Tobacco Company.

Q  Okay. But the American Tobacco Company's database had the correct name for Ronald Snow, didn't it?

A   It did,

Q   Knowing what you know about the recordkeeping, if it had the correct name and in fact the customer number, why would it address something to him as Mr. Renal S?

A   I don't know why.

Q       Okay.    And does his customer number appear anywhere on this Official Order Form?

A       I don't see it anywhere.

MR. SOCIAS: Now to the court reporter, the document, the next document, is it something that says Official Order Form Side 1 on top? THE COURT REPORTER: Yes.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Let's label that one page as Exhibit 7.

(PLAINTIFF'S EXHIBIT 7 WAS MARKED FOR IDENTIFICATION)

MR. SOCIAS: And the next page, does that say Official Order Form - Side 2?

THE COURT REPORTER: Yes.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Then Exhibit 7 will be those two documents, those two pages.

Q   And what does that mean?

A I was just trying to for ray own personal notes so I could help explain this, identify the year in which this was received.

offer has to do with Brown and Williamson?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A  Sir, as I mentioned before, this is from 1993. This was the American Tobacco Company,

Q   Okay. Mow it says, "Simply save 10 UPC symbols eight from cartons of Pall Mall plus send 2 bonus UPCs that are attached below." Do you see that?

A   Yes.

Q   What is a UPC?

A  That's a universal product code. That's the bar codes that you find on virtually every packaged product you buy.

Q   Okay. So this was something that was sent to Mr. Snow that said if he saved his universal product codes and sent them into Pall Mall Salutes America, he'd get a $50 savings bond back, right?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

Q   Is that correct, sir?

A   I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?

0   Sure. This document was sent to Mr. Snow telling him that if he saved these universal product code symbols as provided in item number one and then sent them to Pall Mall Salutes America at the address shown in item two that he would receive a $50 savings bond back, correct?

A  That's correct.

Q   Okay. Now let's turn to the second page of Exhibit

3        Q   Okay.

4        A  I don't know how this was, this piece was assembled.

5        q  Well, when you saw this piece, did you see it in its,

6    in its original format or did you see a photooopy of it? 1                  A  When I saw it, it looks just like this.

8        Q   Okay. Does R. J. Reynolds have the original document

9    or just a photooopy?

10                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

11        A  This  this document was located in the Brown and

12    Williamson archive system which is a scanned version of the

13    original hard copy.

14        Q   Okay. And do you know where the original hard copy is?

15        A   I do not know.

16        Q   Do you know if it's, if it still exists?

17        A   I don't know that.

16                  Q       Did you make any effort to try to locate it?

19        A  No, sir. I found the scanned version in the archive

20    system.

21        Q   Okay. And then in this Official Order Form - Side 2,

22    it designates Esilda Snow as a co-owner, correct?

23        A   Co-owner or beneficiary.

24        Q   Beneficiary. That would be of the savings bond, right?

A  Sir, can you repeat the question?

Q   Sure. Does R. J. Reynolds have in its possession any documents that purport to contain the handwriting or even the printing of Esilda Snow in its possession?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A   Through, through the exhaustive document identification search, Exhibit 7 is the only document that we have produced that has Esilda's signature.

Q   Okay. And the only reason that's the only one you produced is because that's the only one you have, correct?

A   I don't know that to be fact, sir.

THE COURT REPORTER: Yes.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Let's mark that as Exhibit 8. (PLAINTIFF'S EXHIBIT 8 WAS MARKED FOR IDENTIFICATION)

Q   Mr, Setchell, can you identify Exhibit 0 for me? A  It appears to be a form that Mr. Snow completed and sent into Brown and Williamson Tobacco.

Q   And what** the purpose of this form? A   It is an order form.

Q       Were these products that Brown and Williamson Tobacco was sending to consumers when they would send in proof of purchases or is it something they had to pay for?

Q Okay. These were orders for products that Brown and Williamson would send to its customers that clipped and saved the universal product codes from Pall Hall or other Brown and Williamson cigarettes that they bought, correat?

A  This particular offer appears to be good for Pall Mall or Terry Tin and Mr. Snow submitted 745 UPCs along with $5.99 processing or shipping and handling. I can't read exactly what that says to receive, to receive these items.

Q       How 745 UPCs, is that 745 packs or cartons of cigarettes?

A  Well, according to the rules, it says packs. "Sorry. No carton UPCs can be accepted."

Q       Okay. So this would be 745 packs of cigarettes?

A   Yes, sir.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Let me, to the court reporter,  if we could move on. I want to mark as the next exhibit the

document that on the top it says Government Relations

Database Record. It has Bates number 536730072. (PLAINTIFF'S EXHIBIT 9 WAS MARKED FOR

IDENTIFICATION)

Q   Mr. Setchell, do you have Exhibit 9 in front of you?

A   Yes, sir.

Q  And I think you referenced this document earlier, if you could identify it for the record.

1     have on the Government Relations Database for Mr. Snow.

2        Q   Okay.

3        A  He was, he was added on April 1st, 1989 and provided

4     his information.

5        Q  Now this Government Relations Database Record, Database

6    Record has a profile ID for him, but it's different than his

7    customer number. Do you know why that is?

8        A  I don't know why, why that would be.

9        Q  i mean, was he issued both a profile ID and a customer

10    number?

11        A  Based upon the records that we have, it appears that

12     they were separate systems. And so for Government Relations

13    Database, he was given one profile which was different than the

14     other databases.

15        q       Okay. Now what is a Government Relations Database

16    Record?

17        A  The Government Relations Database was something

18    Mr. Snow signed up for. He would as part of that program, he

19    had offered to write letters to his politicians for various

20    pro-tobacco initiatives.

21        Q   And did, was any record kept of whether he wrote these

22    letters or not?

23        A  The only record we have from the Government Relations

24     Database is what we see in front of us, his profile information

25    of him being added in 1989.

7         personal knowledge, you can respond to the question.

8         A   Sir, I don't know. I don't have any knowledge as to

9     what, if Mr. Snow was ever contacted, if he ever wrote any, any

10     letters or what Government Relations may have sent him, asked

11     him or otherwise.

12         q       Well, did you look to see if a database existed just

13     like there's a database about certain fliers that were sent to

14     Mr. Snow to see if a database existed that, that chronicled or

15     kept track of communications regarding Government Relations sent

16     to Mr. Snow?

17         A   I did. And this is the only information retrievable. IS      Q   Well, did you, did you learn that such a database ever 3 9           existed?

20         A   Yes, it existed. That's why this, that's why we have

21     this document.

22         q   Right. No. But I mean a database that kept track of

23     communications from R. J. Reynolds or Brown and Williamson to

24     Mr. Snow regarding communicating with politicians on tobacco

19        q   Well, sir, it's not outside the  well, never mind.

20    Nevertheless, you made an effort to find it, correct?

MR. BEACH: Let me just counsel you, Mr. Setchell. The questions are extremely ambiguous. That last question refers to a certain database. In framing responses to ambiguous questions, I would ask you to be as specific as possible.

4                  (PLAINTIFF'S EXHIBIT 10 WAS MARKED FOR

5         IDENTIFICATION)

6         Q       Mr. Setchell, let me ask you to look at Exhibit 10 and

7     see if you can identify that.

8         A  Yes, sir. These are the phone records from Brown and

9     Williamson regarding Mr. Snow contacting Brown and Williamson.

10         0   Okay. Now is this a computer printout or is this

11     something that was put together from some other data, thiB piece

12     of paper?

13         a  This is a computer printout from the archive system,

14         q   i guess, is it a direct printout? Is this the way the

15     archive shows up on the computer or did someone go to the

16     archives and get and extract data and create this record? n      A   I'm not exactly sure on how this was compiled,

IS      Q   In other words, on top it has Brown and Williamson

19     Consumer Relations System Phone Contact Center Records, Is that

20     something you'd normally see on a computer printout?

21         A   I'm not sure, sir. I'm not sure how this was compiled

22     into this one page document.

23         Q       Okay. Then it says "Three records below with dates of

24     contact highlighted in yellow." Who highlighted them?

25         A  I'm, I'm not sure. Someone who was locating this

information must have done that,

Q Okay. Now, what is the signifioanoe of the three records? Is that -- what is the significance of the three reoords highlighted in yellow?

A Well, the highlighted section on each of the records just shows the date and time of when Mr. Snow contacted Brown and Williamson via the telephone.

Q   Okay. Now according to this document, you only have a record of three contacts or there are only three that are highlighted in yellow? I'm just trying to understand the document.

A  According to this document, Mr. Snow called Brown and Williamson on three different occasions requesting coupons.

Q   Okay. And then we have  does the first block of information, does that all relate to a single contact?

A   I'm sorry. Can you repeat that?

Q Sure. You say there were three contacts shown on Exhibit 10 and you see how it's in three blocks of information?

A  Yes, sir.

Q   Does the first block all relate to the first contact?

A   Yes, sir.

1        A  I don't know what that means. However, if you look at

3     Sky Alland may be the individual that took the call.

4        q  Okay. And then it says Enclosure Letter With Envelope,

5    Juna 24.  Is that a reference to Brown and Williamson's response

6    where they sent the coupons?

7                 MR. BEACH: I'm sorry. Ma'am, can you repeat the

12    where it says Enclosure Letter With Envelope?

13        A  Yes, sir.

U                  Q  is that a referenoe to a letter being sent to Mr. Snow

15    enclosing the coupons he requested?

16        A  I'm not sure exactly what that references.

17        q   Okay. And then there in each block right after that,

18     there are references to Coupon, Coupon, Coupon. Is that a

19    reference to coupons that were sent to Mr. Snow in response to

20    his calls?

21                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

1                 MR. BEACH: Object to the form,

2        A  What this document tells us is if we look at the second

3    call from July 28, 1997, three lines up from the bottom of that

4     section, there's the narrative from the phone agent that states,

5     "Caller claims he never received the coupons we promised in

6    June. His signature card has not been keyed yet. He says he

1          mailed it back a month ago." So based, and then looking at June

8     24, the narrative says, "Wants coupons." We look at April 24,

9    1998, the narrative says "Wanted coupons." So based upon the

10     information that's provided in this document/ it's  the

11     evidence suggests that Mr. Snow called on three different

12    occasions, twice in '97 and once in '98 to Brown and Williamson

13     requesting coupons.

14        Q   How you mentioned you thought the name Maria Evans may

15    be the name of the person that took the call?

16        A   Yes, sir.

17        q   in the second block? Yet in the third block, it has

18     the name, Young America, Do you believe there's someone named

19    Young America at Brown and Williamson that took that call?

20        A   Sir 

21                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

22        A   Sir, I don't know. I was just trying to be helpful in

24        Q   Okay. But do you know for a fact what any aspect of

9        Q   Okay. And now this shows, let's see, Profile Status

10    Closed. Do you know what that means?

11        A   Yes. His, his profile is closed. Meaning no further

12    communications are mailed to Mr. Snow.

13        Q       Okay. Does it indicate when the last communication was

14    nailed to Mr. Snow?

15        A  It does not. It indicates when his profile status was

16    changed to closed which was January 4, 2007.

H      Q   That's a few months after he died, right?

18                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

19        Q  Correct?

20        A   I'm aware that he passed away in 2006.

21        Q       Okay. Is it a ooinoidenoe that a few months after he

22    died his profile status was changed to closed?

23        A   No, sir.

24        Q   Okay. What caused his profile status to be changed to

25    closed?

1         A  As part of our database operations, we get updates from

2     the US postal service as well as other government entities to

3     ensure that addresses are up to date. This information includes

4     death records sent in.

5        q   So when one of your motors dies, you close his

6    profile?

7        A  when we receive information whether it be an address

8     change or whether someone is deceased, we update our records as

9     quickly as possible,

10        q  Right. But if it's an address change, you would ohange

11     his address. You wouldn't close his profile, would you?

12         A   Correct. It's, it's all through the same process.

13         Q   Right. What other than death would lead you to close

14     someone's profile?

15        A  It could be fraudulent activity.

16        Q   Okay. Anything else?

17        A   Someone could choose to opt out. All of our mailings

18     include information that says to be removed from our mailing

19     list, you can call this number, write remove on the label or

20     send it back and you'll be removed from the mailing list and

21     your account would be closed.

22         Q   Has that always been the case?

23        A   As far as I know the ability  because this is a

24     permission-based database just as individuals can, adult tobacco

1                  MR. SOCIAS: Now to the court reporter, if we could

2        move along to a document on the top that says, and it's the

3        kind of document that would read sideways, it says RJRT

4         Responses.

5                  {PLAINTIFF'S EXHIBIT 12 WAS MARKED FOR

6         IDENTIFICATION}

7        Q       You have it, Mr. Setohell?

8        A   Yes, sir.

9        Q   Okay. I'm going to need to get my reading glasses out

10     for this, but can you identify this document?

11        A  Yes, sir. This is information from the R. J. Reynolds

12    archive database which lists the responses received from

13    Mr. Snow in the first box entitled Archive Responses, The

14     second box below is a detail of the R, J. Reynolds call center

15    records when Mr. Snow called R. J. Reynolds.

16        Q   Okay, How is the RJRT call oenter records on Exhibit

17     12, how does that differ from the three calls that are IB          referenced on Exhibit 10?

19        A   Exhibit 10 is Brown and Williamson.

20        Q   Okay.

21        A  Exhibit 12 is R. J. Reynolds.

22        Q       Okay, Well, let's start with the RJRT Responses,

23    Archive Response.

24        A   Okay.

25                Q       And what do these entries reflect, sir?

A  These entries reflect in some instances information that was mailed back from Mr. Snow to R. J. Reynolds. And in one instance in the Archive Response, it, you'll see about halfway down, there is an entry for CRS Pall Mall request question. That in particular on 5/31/2005 references Mr. Snow calling the R. J. Reynolds contact center which you see the records of that contact in the box below under CRS Archive. Mr. Snow on 5/31 contacted Reynolds regarding Pall Mall specifically requesting coupons.

Q  Where does it say, where does it say requested coupons because I see he request question, request question?

A   Request question.

Q   Maybe you can point out the coupon. I'm just trying to understand where you got the coupon from.

A  Sure. Let's go line by line down that second column.

Q   Fair enough. Let's do it line by line and the first line, it all begins with the sane number; is that  except for the very last one. is that the profile number?

A   Oh, I'm sorry. Are you referring to the upper box? The Archive Response?

Q   Yes. We're just going to do it one at a time real quick.

A  Okay.

Q       The first number,  that's the archive number?

A       No,  sir.    The first number is that 932829279 is Mr.

1     Snow's R. J. Reynolds customer ID or profile ID on the database.

2        Q       And then under BRC, there's some codes there. Do you

3    know what they mean?

4        A  Those were codes on the individual responses that

5    Mr. Snow sent back in. It's  think of it as, like, a version

6    code on a particular response card.

7        Q       Okay. Do you know what the codes refer to? In other

8    words/ from looking at these codes, can you tell us what he was

9    responding to?

10                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question,

11        a   Looking at the codes, no. But the description right

12    next to it gives us some information as to what he was, what he

13    mailed back in.

14        Q   Okay.

15        A   So the first one is Special Analysis.

16        Q   Okay. What is a Special Analysis?

17        A   I don't know exactly what that was. What we, what I

18    was able to find, if you turn to the next page on Exhibit 12 

19    disregard that. Special  I don't know exactly what that was.

20        Q   Okay.

21        A   It's something he completed and sent back in. We show

22    that we have the signature and he sent it back on May 3, 2002.

23    And indicated some brand information as well.

24        Q   Okay. Now under Response, RESP DT?

25        A   Yes, sir.

Q   Okay, So the response, that's the response date and the dates seem to be the right of that. Those dates would relate to the entry RESP DT?

A  I'm sorry. I didn't follow your question.

Q       I'm trying to see, it looks like the columns don't line up with the captions. I'm just trying to  the date, 5/3/2002 is the response date. That goes with the caption response date that's off to the left?

A   That's correct.

Q   Okay. And then the sero, that would go with the L10

UB?

Correct.

What does that, the sero mean?

That represents  well, what that column is if you recall from before that L10 UB is last 10 UB. So that question may not have been asked on that. Otherwise, he claims that zero of the last 10 Mr. Snow bought were of his usual brand.

Q       Okay. Okay. And then Response Number, what is that, just a, is that just a code that is assigned to a response? A   I'm not exactly sure what that represents. Q   Okay. And then tinder Signature 98 1,  what does that mean?

A   Signature, I think the 98 goes under the other heading of SB underscore CD and signature  Q   But what does that mean?

3        A  And signature just being flagged as yes as being on A           file.

5        Q   Okay. Well, for instance, the one, two, three, the

6    fourth entry doesn't have T for the signature. Does that mean

7    it's not on file at that point?

8        A  The fourth entry was a phone call.

9        Q   How can you tell?

10        A  Well, that's the CRIS rewrite update person.

11        Q  Yes.

12        A  That's tied to the entry number 5 below the CRS Pall

13    Mall Request Question on 5/31/2005.

14        Q       Right. But, and what is it about that that leads you

15    to oonolude that it was a phone call?

16        A   Per the records below in the RJRT call center records,

17     the CRS system is the Customer Relation System. That's our

18    phone center.

19        Q   Okay.

20        A   So what that signature represents is that the other 

21     I probably didn't say it clearly enough. It's not a signature

22    on file. It's that these responses included a signature from

23    Mr. Snow,

24        Q       Okay. And then under OB flavor, you have number 2

25    throughout. Do you know what that's a reference to?

3

4
	Q   Okay. Then under zip, is that a zip 5?

5
	A   Yes, sir.

6
	Q   You've got again the number 2 all the way down and than

7
	a zero at the bottom. Do you know what any of that means?

	A  No, sir. I believe those numbers go with the UB

	Q   Okay. Hell, do you know what the zero at the bottom

11
	means as opposed to the 66?

12
	A   No, sir.

13
	Q       Okay. And then there's the very last oolumn, it has a

14
	series of numbers. Some are the same. Some are different. Do

15
	you know what any of these mean?

	A  Those are in the zip underscore 5. I envision that --

4        A   No, sir.

5        Q   Do you know what the paok inaert is?

6        A   I don't have any specifics on this other than what this

7     line tells us.

8        Q   You don't know anything about this other than what the

9    words say?

10        A   Correct.

11        Q  Okay. And then it says the number 10, Do you know

12    what that relates to?

13        A   Yes. Like we said before, that's the last 10 UB. So

14     on this response that Mr. Snow sent back in, that would indicate

15    that of whatever he declared as his usual brand he said that of

16    the last 10 purchases, 10 of them were for his usual brand. n      Q  And what had he declared as his usual brand?

18      A   I can't discern that from this particular information. Id      Q        Can you discern it from any information that you have,

20    that you have found?

21                 MR. BEACH: Object to the form of the question.

22        a  We have numerous documents where Mr. Snow declared that

23    pall Mall was his usual brand.

24        q      Okay. In the next entry, it says, Pall Mall, April

25    2005, Franchise 5 OS. Do you know what that refers to?

A   Give me one second. I don't know exactly what that is other than what it states.

Q   Okay.

A  Mr. Snow returned a brand record card dealing with Pall Mall, April 2005.

Q   Okay. Then the CriB rewrite update person and the CRS Pall Mall request question, you say those relate to telephone calls Mr. Snow placed to RJR, right?

A   Correct.

Q   And then the next entry is Corp Data Cap Mass Screener, December '96. Do you know what that means?

A  Yes. Mr. Snow completed a brand screener in December 10th, '96 sent that back into R. J. Reynolds,

Q       And do you know what information was in there?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A Sir, I'm looking to see if I have an exemplar of that one. I have something similar* Essentially, it's asking questions around usual brand. Again, it has the certification statement that requires signature, that the individual is a smoker 21 years of age or older and wants to receive offers in the mail. And it asks essentially brand information and other interests.

Q   Right. But do you have any information that Mr. Snow filled in and submitted 

MR. BEACH: Sir, it's getting a little harder

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=139

1        to hear you. You may have moved farther from the phone.

2                 MR, SOCIAS: I have. I'm sorry.

3        Q   Do you have a record of the information Mr. Snow

4     submitted in this brand soreener?

5        A   No, we have  what this data suggests, this is just

6    the record that we received this information from Mr. Snow,

7        Q   Right. But the information from Mr. Snow was never put

8    into a database that you kept track of?

9        A  I don't know that to be factual.

10        q   Okay. You haven't found that database, right?

11        A  Well, we have his database records. We have 

12        Q       Right, right. Other than what you have, what you've

13    found, you haven't found specifically what he put in that '96

14    soreener, right?

15        A   Correct.

16        Q   And then there is a Corp '96 Resoreen. Is that more of

17     the same?

18        A   Yes, sir.

19        Q        And you don't know what he put on that either, do you?

20        A  The only information we have is captured here in this

21     spreadsheet.

22        Q   Okay. Then there's a Corp Colors 2 Rescreen MOM. What

23    is that?

24                A       That is a re-screener similar to the prior two above.

25                q       Okay.    Did R. J. Reynolds offer anything to smokers for

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240

W O) CD

4* OpgNbr=140
141

filling out these screeners?

A  Well, let me reference one of the screeners from '96. By completing this information  let's see. "Offer restricted to smokers 21 years or older. Your signature and birth date are required to determine your eligibility. I certify that I'm a smoker, that I'm 21 years of age or older and that I want to receive offers, premiums, coupons or cigarettes that may be sent to me in the mail. I understand that giving false information in order to accept these offers may constitute a violation of law,"

Q  Okay. And then the second pert of this document is RJRT Call Center Records?

A   Yes, sir.

Q  What is that a record of?

A  That's a record of the, as we mentioned before, in the box above in the Archive Response, Mr. Snow called R. J. Reynolds on May 31, 2005. He contacted us by phone. The brand he was contacting us about is Pall Mall, His consumer issue was a request or question. He was contacting us regarding specifically coupons.

Q       So all of the entries under RJRT, does that all relate to a single call?

A   Yes, sir.

Q       Okay.    Now under either Case Number or Follow-Up, I have a hard time telling, you see where the first two entries

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=141
142

are zeros and then the number 1 appears?

A   Yes, sir.

Q  What is that? What is that? What do those number* mean?

A  I don't know what those numbers represent,

Q  If this is all one call, do you know why they would be different?

A  No, sir. I looked, if you look at the sequence number, you know, the first two rows are identifying who the caller is, Mr. Snow. We have his profile information. Then one, two, three, four layout kind of the order of how the phone call progressed.

Q   Okay. Then at the very end, you see where it has Code 121 and then 10?

A   Yes, sir.

Q  Do you know what that, any of that means?

A   No, sir. I think those, those numbers are actually under the column entitled Answer.

Q   Okay. Do you know what they mean?

A   No, sir.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Now I want to go to the

Q   Can you identify Exhibit 13, sir?

A  Yes. This is a spreadsheet compiled from a database, the R. J. Reynolds database records for Mr. And Mrs. Snow. This was compiled partly by myself to help explain the mailings, the communications sent to Mr. And Mrs. Snow per your request.

Q   Okay. So see if I can -- Exhibit 13 was not an existing document within R. J. Reynolds. It was a document that you created from other documents that you located?

A   It's a document that I created summarizing the database output.

Q   Okay. And the database output, would that be 

A   I just want to mention, sir, I just want to make this easier to walk through than looking at some of the previous database records which are very hard to discern.

Q Right. But this document, Exhibit 13, was compiled from the other documents that we've been looking at and have marked as exhibits today, correct?

A   Part, partly. This has, this is all R. J. Reynolds specific and this, this document shows all of the, everything that was communicated to Mr. Snow, what was in the mailing, if there were coupons, if the coupons were redeemed, what value those coupons were, if there were response cards in the mailing and whether or not the response cards were responded to by Mr. Or Mrs. Snow.

Q   Right. But I just want to make sure I understand. As

4         Q   Okay. Now other than the documents that we have marked

11                  MR. BEACH: Ma'am, can you repeat the question,

12         please?

13         q   Let me just ask it again. Other than the documents

14     that we have marked as exhibits today, and let's set aside

15     Exhibit 13 because that's something that you created, are there

16     any other R. J. Reynolds documents that you have been able to

17     locate that chronicled or referred to communications between IB          Mr. Snow and either R. J. Reynolds or Brown and Williamson or

19     the American Tobacco Company?

20                  MR, BEACH: And, Mr. Setchell, to answer that

21         question, you may want to  there's a lot of paper in front

22         of you right now. You may want to take a minute and --

23         Q   yeah, take your time and look through it. I just want

24     to make sure if there's some other documents that I've missed

25     that we can mark it and talk about it.

1                 MR. BEACH: In other words, do you have any

2        documents that haven't been marked as exhibits that

3        specifically refer to contacts with either Mr. Or Mrs. Snow,

4        That's what you're looking for.

5                 THE WITNESS: Okay.

6                 MR. BEACH: See, part of the problem here is he has

7         separate copies, Mr. Socias, of stuff that was marked as

8        exhibits and some which I don't want 

9                 MR. SOCIAS: I understand there's a few exhibits

10        and I'm getting close to wrapping it up. I, I just want to

11        make sure that I've covered all the documents that actually

12        chronicle or refer to the communications that are actual

13        archival documents rather than something that the witness

14         created.

15        A   Let me just flip through what we've labeled as

16    exhibits.

17        Q       Yeah. And take your tine. I, I, I just want to make

18    sure if we've missed anything that we can go ahead and get a

19    copy of it and ask a few questions on it. Like I say, we're

20    getting very close to wrapping it up.

21        A   Sir, I located, located a document. It's a signature

22     card from Mr. Snow. It appears to be from 1998 that was not

23    marked as an exhibit.

24         Q   Okay. Let's, let me pull that. Do you have a Bates

25    number on that?

A   I do. It's 53673. It's three pages. I'm 0076 is the number of the page that I'm looking at.

Q  Okay. We'll pull that and is that it oz are you still looking?

A  Well, that's what I have in my pile.

Q   Okay.

A  Here's what else I have. I have all the same information that you have regarding the mailings pulled as exemplars for Mr. Snow.

Q   Right, yeah. I'm not interested in the exemplars. I'm mainly interested in actual records of, archival records of communications whether it be by phone or mail or any other way.

A  The only other thing that I can think of is while I compiled this summary of the raw database records, I did that, you know, in lieu of sending raw database records to you in an attempt to make this easier to understand. So that's 

Q   Wait. You mean you have raw database records that we have not gotten?

A   Correct. Based  and that's what this summary sheet of Ronald and Esilda Snow RJR Archival Mailings was compiled from.

Q   Okay. Oh, so this summary sheet was not compiled from what we've marked as exhibits. It was compiled from other documents as well?

A   Yes, sir. Some of it was. The Esilda, Esilda Snow

portion, we looked at already. The Ronald Snow which you see from 1992 to 2007 was compiled from other records to put it into more readable and understandable format.

Q   Well, when you say you have other archival reoords chronicling contacts with Mr. Snow that have not been produced to us?

A   I had the raw data that this summary sheet was compiled from.

Q  Okay. Well, some of the raw data has already been marked as exhibits, right?

A   Yes, sir.

Q   Okay. And some has, was not produced to us, right?

A  Correct. The raw, the raw data for this summary sheet.

Q   How was the decision made regarding what raw data would and would not be produced to us?

A It was just based upon readability. I compiled this just to make this easier for us to walk through and make sure everyone understood it.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Mr. Breach, does RJR intend to

produce the rest of the documents?

MR. BEACH; If you would like  I mean, it's not

clear to me frankly what else there is, but if there are

additional screen shots from databases that support the

content of this exhibit and you would like them, I'm happy

to have Mr. Setchell collect them and we'll provide them

through our local Counsel.

MR. SOCIAS: Yeah. I mean, I'm interested in

evidentiary documents, not demonstratives. I'd like to see

what actually, you know, has evidentiary value so if I could

have those,

Q   I found  is this what he had referenced earlier? Okay. I think I found the signature card that you referenced. That'a Bates Number 536730076, sir?

A  Yes, sir.

Q   And did you say, when was the date of that card? Z think you mentioned a date and I'm looking here.

A  Yes. It appears to be based, based on the code that's written on there, it appears to be from 1998.

Q   What code are you looking at?

A   If you look just 

Q   It looks like 92. Maybe I'm looking, we're looking  oh, I'm sorry. That's his birth date. Go ahead.

A   Look just above the signature box where it says "Not valid without a signature and birth date."

Q   Right.

A   Look just above that and to the right and you'll see a long string of numbers that start with 1998.

Q   Right, okay. And this is a signature card for what?

A  Well, according to this, it's Mr. Snow checked yes. "I like saving money. I'm a smoker 21 years of age or older and

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=148
149

1    want to receive future valuable offers from America's highest

2    quality brands."

3        Q   Okay. And here he identified his current brand as Pall

4    Mall, correct?

5        A   That's right.

6        Q  Have you in all of the search that you did found any

7    document within R. J. Reynolds that identified Mr. Snow's brand

8    as being anything other than Pall Mall?

9        A  The only, the only thing I could reference back to

10    would be when Mr. Snow sent in the pack insert from a pack of

11     Doral with his signature on it.

12        Q   And what did he get baok?

13        A   I don't know what he received back or what, what that,

14    what information was necessarily captured.

15        Q   As far as data regarding what Mr. Snow's primary brand

16    is, everything you have when he was ever asked what he smoked, n          the answer was always Pall Mall, wasn't it?

18        A   Based on the data that we have, yes. He stated Pall

19    Mall was his usual brand.

20        Q   Okay. Now earlier we marked a document I think as

21    Exhibit 4. It was one of these sample mailers. What was the

22    Bates number on that? X want to make sure I get the same one in

23    front of me. And I think it was Exhibit 4.

24        A   It was Exhibit 4. It's 0030.

25        Q   Okay. Let me get that. How this says Sample Smoker,

1    Any Street, USA.  Is thiB an internal sample?

2        A  Yes. This was just one that was archived off.

3        Q   I mean, was this generated to produce to us or is this

4     something that appeared with the name Sample A Smoker already on

5     there, 123 Any Street, et cetera?

6        A  No. This was produced by me digging through dozens of

7     boxes of old direct mail and found this one which is extremely

8     similar if not the same content as what was sent to Mr, Snow.

9        Q       Okay. Mow this is advertising Pall Mall as lasting

10     longer because you get more puffs than any other major brands,

11     correct?

12        A   That's what it states.

13        Q   And, in fact, it actually compares numerically the

14     number of puffs you get from Pall Mall to Camel, Doral, Marlboro

15    and Winston and Basic, correct?

16        A   Yes, it does.

17         Q   How, this is  the next to the last page of the

IB          exhibit is a coupon for money off filtered Pall Malls, right?

19        A   Yes, there's a response card and then two coupons on

20    this page.

21        Q   Now according to the information that R. J. Reynolds

22    has, can you tell whether Mr. Snow smoked filtered or unfiltered

23    Pall Mall?

24         A  I'm sorry. Could you repeat that question?

25        q  Yes. Does R. J. Reynolds have any information to

1    indicate whether Mr. Snow's brand was filtered or unfiltered

2    Pall Malls?

3                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

4        A  Based on  from the Reynolds database standpoint it

5    is unknown whether it was filtered or non-filtered Pall Mall.

6    Based on his prior responses to Brown and Williamson as well as

7     the American Tobacco Company, he indicated on several occasions

8    which we've already reviewed that he smoked non-filter.

9        Q       Okay. Now do you know whether, say for Exhibit 4,

10    whether what was actually sent to Mr. Snow was for filtered or

11    non-filtered Pall Malls?

12        A   Exhibit 4?

13        Q   Exhibit 4 is for filtered, but this is addressed, it's

14     a sample addressed to Sample A Smoker. Do you know if what

15    Mr. Snow actually got was for non-filtered Pall Mall?

16        A  I'm just looking, I'm looking at the data real quick,

17                 MR. BEACH: I'll object to the form of the

18        question.

19        A   All I know is that Mr. Snow was sent something similar

20     to this, to Exhibit 4.

21        Q       Similar, but it could have been for non-filtered Pall

22    Malls, correct?

23                                  MR. BEACH:    Objection to the form of the question.

24                q       You can answer,  sir.

25                A       Yes.    I'm just looking through my files.    I don't know

1    what  based from the information that we have, Mr. Snow was

2    sent this communication or something very similar to it.

3        Q       Okay. But my question is different. Do you know one

4    way or the other whether it wag for filtered or non-filtered

5    Pall Mall/ what was actually sent to him?

6                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

7        A  Sir, I'm just checking some of the information that I

8    have to see if I can answer your question most accurately. Sir?

9        Q   Yes.

10        A  I don't know the answer to your question. You would

11    have to speak to someone who is involved with this promotion at

12     the time to give you an accurate answer on if there were

13    different coupons available in this mailer.

14                 MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Okay. That's all I have.

15        Thank you.

16                 MR. BEACH; I have a few questions as well. Mr.

17        Socias, I'm going to e-mail you two demonstratives right now

19                 MR. SOCIAS: Wait. I'm sorry/ Geoff. I missed the

22        I'm going to e-mail you two demonstratives that I'd like to

23        use in conjunction with my examination. I'm going to e-mail

MR. SOCIAS: We're trying to get that up. We don't have it yet. Want to take five?

MR. BEACH: Well, I can go ahead and just do a couple of follow-up questions for starters and maybe it'll come.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. But I don't have my paralegal here now. She's trying to do it. You mind? Let's just take a quick break and then hopefully we'll be back with everything.

MR. BEACH: Sure. That's fine. (RECESS TAKEN)

MR. SOCIAS: I have a question. I just want to make sure, it would be one of the last documents I referred to, I'm not sure if we marked the 1998 signature card.

MR. BEACH: You didn't. I actually was going to go mark that, 0076. I prefer, sir that we mark the complete document as an exhibit. So it's starts out Consumer Query Results and if you're willing to do that, that's fine. Otherwise, I'll separately mark the first two pages.

MR. BEACH: Well, I don't think you asked about that. So, you know, you can have whatever assumptions you want 

MR. SOCIAS: That's fine. You can use those. I just want to use the signature card that he testified about which is 536730076 and I would just ask the court reporter to mark that as an exhibit. What number would that be?

THE COURT REPORTER: That would be 14.

EXAMINATION BY MR, BEACH:

Q   Good afternoon, Mr, Setchall,

A  Good afternoon.

Q  Could you please just tell the members of the jury a little bit about yourself, your current position and what, how the one to one marketing program works?

A   Sure. I'm Joel Setchell. I am currently the senior director in consumer marketing of one to one communications. We are responsible for, my group is responsible for the general operations of our one to one communications including direct mail, e-mail. We also have a contact center, phone contact center under my group. We manage the adult tobacco consumer database. It is a permission-based database. Consumers opt in, certify, get age verified through third-party services to ensure that they are tobacco consumers, that they want to receive communications from R. J. Reynolds and that they are at least 21 years of age or older.

Q  Now you've seen a variety of records that you have compiled with respect to Hr. And Mrs. Snow. Do virtually all of the records that specifically refer to them contain the certification and/or refer to the verification that you just  MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object.

Q    described in your prior answer?

MR. SOCIAS: I'm sorry. I don't know if that's the

same question or a new question, but I object to the form,

WWW.USLEGA1SUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=155
156

1        Q  Let me restate the question. Did, did virtually all of

2     the records that you looked at for Mr. Snow contain a

3    certification statement from him indicating that he wished to,

4     that he was an existing smoker, that he wished to receive offers

5    from Reynolds including coupons?

6                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

7        A  Based upon our records from American Tobacco Company,

8    Brown and Williamson Tobacco and Reynolds, we have information,

9    we have records showing that Mr. Snow did want to receive

10    communications from the respective company, that he provided his

11     signature, he was certified, he was age verified and we have all

12     that in record.

13        Q  And how does, how did Reynolds or American or Brown and

14    Williamson know that Mr. Snow wanted to receive the kinds of

15    communications, offers and coupons that you've been answering

16    questions about? How did, how did you know that that's what he

17    wanted?

18                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

19        A   Based upon the card, the cards that he completed,

20    signed and sent in. All those  let me use an exemplar,

21        Q  For example, if you take a look at Exhibit 6.

22                 MR. SOCIAS: Wait. Let me get Exhibit 6. Okay.

23        a  Exhibit 6 which is a -- it says, "For future savings,

24     just complete this form." This was completed by Mr. Snow, It

25     states that "I am a smoker, 21 years of age or older and want to

regularly receive future valuable cigarette offers from Brown and Williamson, maker of America's highest quality brands." He included, he completed the form, included his signature and date of birth. And under that,  it states, "By signing, I certify that I'm a smoker at least 21 years old and want to receive cigarette coupons and/or other promotional offers in the mail. I understand that giving false information to qualify for these offers may violate the law."

Q      Did you see in any instance where Reynolds sent a mailing to Mr. Or Mrs. Snow that had not been preoeded by them completing the certification form like what you have just referred to as Exhibit 6?

MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object to the form.

A  Communications were sent from, from Reynolds or Brown and Williamson or American Tobacco either after receiving a card like we just mentioned in Exhibit 6 with the signature and certification statement or from a phone call from Mr. Snow to one of the tobacco companies requesting coupons.

Q   Okay. So returning to  based upon all of the records that youWe reviewed with respect to Mr. Snow, can you think of or have you seen any record whioh suggests that anything was ever sent to him that hadn't baen requested? MR, SOCIAS: Object to the form.

A  No. As a matter of fact, all of the mailings  let's look at  I'll just use Exhibit 4 as an example. Right above

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=157
158

the address line on all the mailings sent to Mr. Snow states, "If you would like your name removed from our mailing list, please call 1-888-610-9030 or contact us at You Come First dot net or send your complete mailing label to mailing list PO Box 35090, Louisville, Kentucky, 40232.

0  And do you have --I'm sorry. Did you finish your answer?

A   I, I just would like to state that Mr. Snow had every opportunity with every mailer to ask to be removed from our database and to cease receiving our communications.

Q  And based upon the totality of the documentary evidence that you reviewed, did Mr, Snow ever contact Reynolds or Brown and Williamson or American Tobacco Company and ask to be removed from their mailings?

A  The on]y records of contacts we have from Mr. Snow were for him requesting coupons.

Q   I will represent to you that in her testimony, the Plaintiff testified that at one point in time she began to review Mr. Snow's mail on his behalf including offers from Reynolds or other mailings. Do you have any record that Mrs. Snow herself reached out and contacted Reynolds asking those mailings to cease at any point in time?

A   No.

MR.  SOCIAS:    Object to the form.

A       We have no record of anyone contacting us regarding

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=158
159

Mr. Or Mrs. Snow to be removed from our database.

MR, BEACH: Okay. Let me go ahead and ask the court reporter to mark as the next exhibit, it's a demonstrative entitled Snow - Summary of Contacts with Reynolds.

(DEFENDANT'S EXHIBIT 15 WAS MARKED FOR IDENTIFICATION)

MR. SOCIAS: I'd like to object. I'm going to object to a prepared demonstrative like this being marked as an exhibit and I'm going to object to questions based on this type of created document.

MR. BEACH: On what basis, sir?

MR. SOCIAS: On the basis that this is not an evidentiary document. The witness can certainly testify to this if he knows. I think this is an argumentative document. I don't think it's supported by the raw material that's been marked as an exhibit.

MR. BEACH: Well, then, sir 

MR, SOCIAS: I don't think you can mark demonstratives as exhibits and try and get them into evidence that way. So I think it's, it's improper and I'm going to object to this document being marked or to questions from this document. You can certainly question the witness about the facts.

MR. BEACH: Okay. Well, look. This is offered not

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=159
160

as substantive evidence but for demonstrative purposes to

accompany his testimony. And if you have any

cross-examination on the content of the statements, I'm sure

we'll, we'll hear from it, hear it as soon as I'm finished

with my questions.

Q  Now, Mr. Setchell, turning to what's been narked as Exhibit 15 to your deposition, is this a summary of oontaots with Reynolds regarding Mr. And Mrs. Snow that you assisted in preparation for, for the purposes of this deposition?

MR. SOCIAS: Can I have a standing objection to

questions regarding this Exhibit 15? MR. BEACH: Sure. MR. SOCIAS: Okay.

A   I'm sorry. Could you repeat your question?

Q   The question is simply this. We're now looking at Exhibit 15 to your deposition. It's entitled Snow - Summary of Contaots with Reynolds. Did you assist in the preparation of this demonstrative for the purposes of describing Mr. Snow's oontaots with Reynolds? Did you assist in preparing this demonstrative to facilitate describing the oontaots that Mr. Snow had with Reynolds over the years?

A   Yes.

Q Okay. How what I'd like to do is ask you to walk the members of the jury through the record of oontaots that's laid out on this summary.    So they'll have a better sense of those

1    contacts, how they arose and what came of them. 80 if you could

2     just walk us through, tell us what happened first in 1989.

3        A   Based upon 

4                 MR. SOCIAS: Wait. Let me, let me object to the

5        form. Go ahead.

6        A  I will just give a chronological overview based upon  1                  Q   Let's do it this way. Let's go ahead and take the

8    entries one by one. So first, let's start in 1989, what

9    happened?

10        A   In 1989, we have record of Mr. Snow opting in and

11     joining the Government Relations Database.

12        Q   And for which company?

13        A   R. J. Reynolds.

14        Q   And is that reflected in what was marked as Exhibit 9

15    to your deposition testimony today?

16        A   Yes, sir.

17        q   Now what happened next? What happened in 1990?

18        A   In 1990, Mr. Snow contacted the American Tobacco

19    Company and was signed up on their database.

20        Q       And what do you know about any coupons or other offers

21    that were sent to Mr. Snow by American Tobacco in or around

22    1990?

23        A  We have no records in particular of American Tobacco

24     sending anything to Mr. Snow in 1990.

25        q   Now so he had signed up with American Tobacco in 1990.

1    What happened in 1992 according to Reynolds' records?

2        A   In 1992, Mr. Snow called R, J. Reynolds and was added

3     to R. J, Reynolds mailing list,

4        Q      And what, what transpired after being added to Reynolds

5    mailing list at this time?

6        A  When, after Mr. Snow being age verified and certified

7     on the Reynolds database, he started receiving mailings from R.

8     J. Reynolds.

9        Q  And you have a record of him redeeming any coupons at

10    or around this point in time?

11        A  I  he  we have a record of him receiving six

12    different mailers that included coupons, none of which were

13     redeemed.

14         Q   Now that's 1992. What happened to Mr. Snow in 1996 in

15     terms of the Reynolds database?

16        A  In 1996, due to Mr, Snow's lack of coupon redemption,

17     he was timed out of the database so he was not responsive.

18    Therefore, he was removed from the active mailing list and was

19    no longer mailed communications from R, J, Reynolds.

20        q  All right. Now let's move forward in time to 1993.

21    what happened in 1993 based upon your review of the archival

22    records regarding Mr. And Mrs. Snow?

23        A   in 1993, it was Exhibit 

24        Q   Seven.

25        A   Yes. Per Exhibit 7 in 1993, Mr. Snow participated in

an American Tobacco Company mailing promotion for a $50 US savings bond.

Q       And actually if I just address your attention to this document, does thie document purport to contain a signature for Mrs. Snow?

A   It does. Mr. Snow designated her as the savings bond co-owner.

Q  And does it provide her Social Security number?

A  It does.

Q  Now, and what is the certification that Mr, Snow makes under his signature at that tine?

A   Mr. Snow states under his signature, "By signing this I certify that I'm at least 21 years of age, a smoker and that I wish to receive free cigarette samples, offers and/or other incentives in the mail subject to applicable"  it's unreadable in this exhibit copy.

Q   Okay. Do you have any record of Reynolds initially initiating a contact saying Mr. Snow, we have an offer we'd like you to think of or was the, were the offers always in response to him?

A   If we look at the timeline 

MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object to the form.

A   In 1989, Mr. Snow initiated contact. In 1990, Mr. Snow initiated contact with American Tobacco. In 1992, Mr. Snow initiated contact with R. J. Reynolds. In 1997, Mr. Snow

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=163
164

initiated contact with Brown and Williamson on three different occasions. In 1998, Mr. Snow completed a signed signature card opting in wishing to receive additional communications. Again, in 2002, completed a signature card opting in wishing to receive communications. And in 2005, Mr. Snow contacted R. J. Reynolds by phone requesting additional coupons for Pall Mall.

Q       Now where we were on the timeline, if I recall correctly, as we were looking at the period of 1993 and the savings bond program reflected on Exhibit 7 to your deposition, did you have, do you have any record, did you see any record of Mrs. Snow contacting Reynolds or American or Brown and Williamson saying that she didn't want to benefit from participation in this promotional program?

A   No, sir.

Q   Let's move forward to 1994. What do your records show at that point in time?

A   In 1994, Mrs. Esilda Snow opted in, certified and was age verified with her signature and was added to the R. J. Reynolds database.

Q   Now what did she do in response to the mailings that she received?

MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

A  There was a mailing in 1996 which included a response card which would have been another signature and additional profile information that Mrs. Snow completed, signed,

WW. USLEGALSUPPORT, COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=164
165

1     recertified herself opting in and wishing to receive additional

2    communications and signed that and sent that back in in 1996.

3        Q  So she actually contacted Reynolds twice, once  at

4     least as far as Reynolds knows, once based upon her signature

5    and her address and other personal information that was

6    supplied, once in 1994 and again in 1996?

7        A   That is correct,

8                 MR. SXIAS: I'm going to object to the form.

9        Q       Now with respect to the mailings that she received, do

10    you have any record of her actually responding to those beyond

11    what you just referred to?

12        A  Of the mailings that were sent to Mrs. Snow from 1994

13    to 1998, three of those included coupons. None of the coupons

14    were ever redeemed.

15        Q  Now in 19  what ultimately happened to in terms of

16    Mrs. Snow's position on the Reynolds database?

17        A   Similar to Mr. Snow in '96, Mrs. Snow due to lack of

18     response received her last mailing from R. J. Reynolds May 5th,

19     1998.

20        q   Okay. Let's now move forward in time to 1997. What

21    happened in 1997 according to the records that you've reviewed?

22        A   In 1997, Mr. Snow called us twice, once in June, once

23    in July. It appears based upon the information that he was

24     requesting coupons. He called again in 1998 requesting coupons.

25        Q       And I want to draw your attention to what's been marked

1     as Exhibit 10 to your deposition. Do you have that handy?

2        A   Yes, sir.

3        q  with respect to the three telephone calls, is that what

4    you1re in part, was that what you were just referring to?

5        a  Yes, sir.

6        Q   Now, and you went through this with Mr. Socias in some

7     detail so I won't belabor it, but the second record contains the

8     statement, "Caller claims he never received the coupons we

9    promised in June. Bis signature card has not been keyed yet.

10    He says he mailed it back a month ago." Can you tell us what

11     that refers to?

12        A  That refers to the June 24, 1997 phone call in which he

13    called for coupons,

14         Q  Okay.

15        A  He  here it -- based on the context in the narrative,

16    he was calling to, almost, a little more than one month later,

17    to see why he never received the coupons he asked for back in

18     June.

19        Q   And what does this record indicate he was told as to

20    what the reason was?

21        A   He was told that he needed an updated signature card

22     sent in, get it keyed into the system to have updated records,

23        q   And just to, just to be clear here with respect to the

24     signature card that you're referring to and we've seen a few

25    different signature cards marked as exhibits in this deposition.

Just generally describe what information ie being collected in the signature card here.

MR. SOCIAS: Object to form.

A  I don't know exactly what this signature card would have been requesting but similar to the other ones that we've seen, it would be first opting in. Yes, I want to receive communications from R. J. Reynolds or Brown and Williamson or American Tobacco Company, name, address, date of birth, other contact information, some brand profile information in terms of what the consumer's usual brand is, a signature with a certification statement saying that they are legal age, 21 years or older, that they're a smoker and that they want to receive communications from us which may include coupons or other gifts.

Q  And then once they had received that signature card at that point, do the phone records indicate that he actually received coupons or do we not, is that not clear from Exhibit 10?

A   It is unclear from Exhibit 10.

MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form. I'm sorry, I'm

just objecting for the record, sir. Go ahead.

Q   Right. Let's, let me just ask you a little bit more about the mailings that Mr. Snow received in this 1997 time period. You indicated he called three times. We just were looking at that phone record. So he received  what, what was the coupons that he received in response to those calls?

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=167
168

MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

A   I don't know what coupons were sent based upon those calls. As we mentioned that the information is not exactly clear. We do know that he was sent additional mailings from Brown and Williamson in that timeframe. He received four mailings, two of those mailings had coupons. He redeemed those. Each mailing had one coupon. He redeemed them both for a total value of $3.

Q  And it also notes that at this point in time or thereabouts, he participated in a UPC promotion. That's where you, you have to send in part of the side of a pack of cigarettes or something like that; is that right?

A   Correct. The bar codes.

Q      And that's reflooted on Exhibit 8 to your deposition; is that correct?

A  Correct.

Q       And, and so the items that he obtained were an electric razor, an answering machine, a pocket rolodex and a bath, bathroom scale?

A   That's what was selected on his order form that he completed.

Q       Is there a similar certification statement oontained with this mailing as well as on Exhibit 8 above his signature? I realise the print is fairly small.

A  Yes. On this document as well, "By signing, I certify

WWW,USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=168
169

1     that I'm a smoker at least 21 years old" and I can't quite make

2     out the balance.

3        Q   Let's, let's move forward, I apologize. Our copy is

4    what it is. The  let's move forward and talk about 2002.

5    What happened in 2002?

6        A  In 2002, Mr, Snow completed two different or mailed

7    back two different pieces of information to R, J, Reynolds, one

8    was entitled Special Analysis, the other was a pack insert from

9    a pack of Dorals, Again, certifying that he was opting in to

10    receive additional communications from R, J. Reynolds Tobacco

11    Company.

12        Q  And then, and according- to your records he in fact did

13    receive mailing* including coupons; is that correct?

14        A   Yes, sir.

15        Q   And then tell us the final event on this timeline in

16    2005, what did your records show?

17        A  Mr. Snow contacted R. J. Reynolds, called and contacted

18     R. J. Reynolds on May 31, 2005 requesting Pall Mall coupons.

19        Q   Okay. And, and based upon your review of the records

20    during this period from 2002 through 2005, what is the total

21    value of coupons that Mr. Snow redeemed?

22                 MR. SOCIAS; I'm going to object to the form and

23         the foundation.

24         A   From 2000 

25        Q   Let me ask you this before you answer that question.

1    Based upon the records that you've reviewed, Mr. Setohell, are

2    you able to estimate, to reasonably estimate the value of

3    coupons redeemed by Mr. Snow?

4                 MR. SOCIAS: Same objection to the extent that he's

5         testifying on records that were not produced.

6        A  Yes, sir. We have Mr. Snow's redemption data,

7        Q   Okay.

B     A  We know the number of coupons that were sent to him and

9          the number that -- the dollar value and what was redeemed.

10        Q  And did you personally examine the records to tabulate

11    the value of the coupons that he redeemed?

12        A   Yes, I did.

13        Q       And based upon your personal review of that data, what

14     is the value of the coupons from Reynolds that Mr., during the

15    period '03 to '05 that Mr. Snow or someone on his behalf

16    redeemed?

17        A   From 2003 through 2005, Mr. Snow redeemed coupons worth IB          a total value of $144.50.

19        Q   And if we take, go back in time all the way to 1997

20    where Mr. Snow you told us had contact with B and W where he

21    was  that was, those were the call center calls?

22        A   Yes.

23        Q       And you indicated I believe in response to questions

24     that he obtained two coupons. Based upon your review of all of

25    the Reynolds records including those B and V records, if we talk

3    redeemed?

4        A   $147.50.

7                  (DEFENDANT'S EXHIBIT 16 WAS MARKED FOR

8         IDENTIFICATION)

9        Q   Mr. Setchell, I'll represent to you that Exhibit 16

10    contains an excerpt from the deposition of the Plaintiff in this

11     case. I know you haven't personally read that deposition,

12    but --

13                 MR. SOCIAS: Let me object to the marking of an

14         excerpt of a deposition as an exhibit in another deposition

15        as well as to any questions asking for comments as to

16        another witness's testimony, but go ahead.

17        Q   Sure, okay. So anyway, what's been put in front of you

18    as Exhibit 16 is the Plaintiff's testimony in response to 

19     "Without any conversations with your attorneys, what do you

20     think any tobacco company ever did wrong to your husband?" Do

21    you see she's asked that question?

22        A   Yes.

23        Q   And her answer is quote, "Sending him coupons to buy

24    more cigarettes." Do you see that?

2     is no. Do you see that?

3        a   Yes, sir.

4         q   How let's go back to Exhibit 15, if we could. With

5     respect to Mr. Snow's contacts over the course of time with

6    American Tobacco, with Brown and Killiamson or with Reynolds in

7     every instance, were the coupons that he received in response to

8     requests he made to receive them?

9         A   Yes, he made, he initiated first contact.

10         Q   Did he initiate contact in 1990?

11                  MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form. Repetitive.

12         A  Yes. Mr. Snow initiated contact with the American

13    Tobacco Company in 1990.

14         Q   And who initiated the contact with Reynolds in 1992?

15         A  Mr, Snow called R. J. Reynolds in '92,

16         Q   And who initiated the contact with American Tobacco in

17     1993?

18         A  Mr. Snow completed and sent in the savings bond form to

19     American Tobacco.

1    returned?

2        A   Yes. Mr. Snow completed re-screeners in 1996,

3        Q  Okay. And who initiated the contact with Brown and

4    Williamson in 1997?

5        A  Mr. Snow contacted Brown and Williamson twice in 1997

6    and once in 199B.

7        0   And who initiated the contact with Reynolds in 2002?

14        Q   Now with respect to the mailers, the exemplars of

17                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

18        A   No, sir. What was, what was mailed to Mr. Snow

19    includes the Surgeon General's warning rotating as required by

20    government regulations. I'd also like to note that every single

23    companies.

1     the best of your knowledge in your researoh in this case in

2    response to the Plaintiff's notice would have said Surgeon

3    General's warning: Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease,

4    emphysema and may complicate pregnancy, correct?

5        A   Correct.

6                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

7        Q       And one of the Surgeon General's warnings that would

8    have been on mailings to Mr. Snow stated Surgeon General's

9    warning: Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to

10    your health, correct?

11        A   Correct,

12                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

13        Q       Another warning would have said Surgeon General's

14     warning: Cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide. Did you see

15    that in the mailings that were directed to Mr. Snow?

16                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form. IV      A   In the exemplars, yes.

18        Q   Now a few follow-up questions from the questions that

19    Mr. Socias asked. Exhibit 5 was the, if I recall your testimony

20     correctly, the database record for Mrs. Snow; is that right?

21        A   That is correct.

22        q   And there was a question at some length about the phone

23    numbers on this record, why the numbers were different from

24    prior records for Mr. Snow. Do you recall that?

25        A   Yes, I do.

Q Now is a general and  and also you were asked about the reference to a signature of hers in this database. Do you recall that?

A   Yes.

Q   Is it Reynolds,  to your knowledge, was it Reynolds or Brown and Williamson system to put a yes if there was not a signature that had been reoeived?

MR, SOCIAS: Object to the form.

A  No, it would not be flagged a yes if a signature had not been received.

Q   And didn't we, in fact, with respect to Mr. Snow see an example where that occurred in conjunction with the call oenter records?

A  That's correct.

Q  Now the phone number, did you  in the exhibits that Plaintiff's Counsel marked, do they contain the phone number referenced on the record that's Exhibit 5 involving Mr. Snow, excuse me, Mrs. Snow?

A   Yes. In Exhibit 7, the phone number listed for the Snows is 457-856-9998 which is the same as the record for Mrs. Snow.

Q   And if we  you know, Plaintiff's Counsel was asking you well, how in the world does Reynolds get these phone numbers, does Exhibit 7 respond to that question? MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

2        A  The information we get was, is provided by in this case

3    Mrs. Snow.

4                 MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object to the form and

5        move to strike as speculation.

6        Q   You know, in Exhibit 10, you were asked about the, some

7     of the text  that's the call center log?

8        A   Yes, sir.

9        Q   You were asked a variety of questions about the meaning

10    of discrete numerical codes or lines of information. Do you

11    recall being asked a few questions like that?

12        A   Yes, sir.

13        Q   And putting aside your response or not putting aside,

14    but irrespective of your response to those questions, do you

15    have a general understanding as to the significance of the

16    information on this page?

17        A   Yes.

18        Q       And have you desoribed it in your testimony already?

19    In other words, what's, what is 

20                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

21        Q   Let me just ask the question this way. What is, just

22    refresh for us one last time, sir, what does Exhibit 10 tell you

23    based upon everything that you know and your work preparing for

24     this deposition?

25                 MR. SOCIAS: Same objection.

A  Exhibit 10 illustrate, these are records directly from Brown and Williamson consumer relations system, phone contacts center records archive. These records indicate when Mr. Snow contacted Brown and Williamson, June 24, 1997, July 28, 1997 and April 24, 1998. Based upon the context of the narrative that's provided in these records, it is  1 believe that he was requesting coupons in June of '97, called back to see why he hadn't received his coupons. In '98, completed a signature card and called back again in April of 1998 requesting more coupons.

Q   Okay, thank you. You ware asked at one point whether or not Mr. Snow contacted American Tobacco prior to 1990. Do you have any evidence based upon the totality of the records that you reviewed of him contacting American Tobacco prior to 1990?

MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form. Foundation.

A   Our records indicate that Mr. Snow's first contact or at his -* Mr. Snow was first  first contacted American Tobacco Company and was subsequently added to their database, age verified and certified in 1990.

Q   To come to that concluaion, tell ue what reoorde or documents you, what research you did, please.

MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object to the form.

Foundation and repetitive.

A  The research is what produced Exhibit 3. These are the archived record from the Brown and Williamson archive system.

1     Brown and Williamson acquired the American Tobacco Company at or

2     around 1995. Therefore, these American Tobacco records are part

3     of the same archive system. We went through the Brown, the

4     entire Brown and Williamson archive, the R. J. Reynolds archive

5     as well as current database system to locate any documents

6     pertaining to Mr, And Mrs. Snow. The earliest record we

7     identified was in 1989 which was the Government Relations

8     contact. After that, the very next record is in 1990 when

9    Mr. Snow contacted, was added, age verified to the American

10     Tobacco Company Database.

11         Q   Right. and so have you looked in the places that you

12     would look to come to the conclusions that you have with respect

13     to your testimony today as well as that contained on Exhibit 15?

14         A  Sir, we have gone through all of our electronic

15     systems, those that have all of our electronic records, database

16     records as well as scans of documents that would have been

17     received similar to the signature cards that the Snow, Mr. Snow

18     had submitted. That's one of the exhibits. We also requested

19     all of the boxes of hard copy information that were produced as

20     exemplars and went through all the archive, through that archive

21     process to produce documents and helping explain the

22     communications to and from Mr. And Mrs. Snow.

23         Q   How much time, set apart the time that you spent

24     preparing, how much time did you and your staff, if you can

25     estimate it, had you spent to identify, collect, review, et

cetera the records pertaining to Mr. And Mrs. Snow in the databases and other files that you just have described?

MR. SOCIAS; Object to the form.

A   I would say collective effort probably about 4 business weeks of combined effort.

Q   Finally, returning to Exhibit 15 with respect to Mr. Snow's contact in 1989 to Reynolds Government Relations, what do you, what is your understanding of what that record reflects in terms of what he was willing to do?

MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

A  My knowledge, my knowledge on that is that the Government Relations established a database that for consumers to opt into to initiate on pro-smoking and pro-tobacco initiatives such as writing their politicians regarding tobacco taxes, writing their politicians regarding other issues affecting their right to choose to use a legal product when they're clearly an adult over 21 years of age,

MR. BEACH: Thanks. I have no further questions, MR. SOCIAS: Okay. I've got just a few, EXAMINATION BY MR. SOCIAS:

Q   As the direotor of the, was it the one on one program?

A   One to one.

Q       Termed correctly?

A       One to one communications,

Q       One to one communications program, do you find the

WWW. USLEGALSUPPORT. COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=179
180

number of contacts that Mr, Snow initiated with tobacco companies to be unusually high?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

It's outside the scope of the notice. If you can respond to

that question based upon your personal knowledge, you can.

But otherwise, you're not responding to that question as a

corporate representative.

A  Sir, all I have are the facts as to how often and when Mr. Snow and Mrs. Snow contacted tobacco companies.

Q So you have no knowledge whatsoever as director of this program what a typical frequency of contact would be between the tobacco company and its customers?

A   No, sir.

Q       Okay. Do you as a corporate representative believe that Mr. Snow had a high level of, high number of contacts with the tobacco company?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form.

A  He contacted us in, he contacted tobacco companies in '98 or '89, '90, '92, '98 

Q       I have --my question is different. Looking at everything you have on your summary 

MR. BEACH: Sir, sir. Excuse me.

Q -- is that, do you consider that to be a high number of contacts?

MR. BEACH: Sir, excuse me. You inadvertently

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=180
181

1        interrupted the witness. You can go ahead and continue your

2        response, Mr. Setchell.

3        A   Mr, Snow contacted tobacco companies in '89, '90, '92,

4     '93. Mrs. Snow in '94, Mr, Snow in '97, '98, 2002 and 2005.

5    Those are the facts. That's what our data tells us.                                      MR. SOCIAS: Move to strike.

7        Q   Can you answer my question now?

8        A   I did answer your question.

9        Oj  No, sir. Do you consider that a high number of

10    contacts?

11                 Mr. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

12        A   I'm not going to give my personal opinion on the number

13    of contacts. It's irrelevant. The facts are we have laid out

14    when and how Mr. Snow contacted tobacco companies.

15        0   Okay. We'll start with 1989, And you testified that

16    Mr. Snow initiated contact with the R. J. Reynolds Government

17    Relations people, right?

18        A  Mr. Snow was added to the Government Relations Database

19    in 1989.

20        q   Right. But you don't have any information one way or

21     the other as to who initiated that oontaot to get him on that

22    database, do you?

23        A  No. All we have is his record. Again, this would,

24     this is permission-based, this is opt in. We don't just, we

1         Q   That's really not my question, You don't know who

2    initiated the contact that resulted in Mr. Snow becoming part of

3    your Government Relations Database, do you?

4                  MR. BEACH: Sir, you inadvertently interrupted the

5         witness in mid-answer yet again. So, Mr. Setcheil, you need

6         to complete your answer to the prior question. If you need

7         to have the question repeated, ask the court reporter to do

8         that.

9        A  Could you please repeat the question?

10         Q   I'll just ask it again. Sir, you don't have any

11     knowledge one way or the other as to who initiated the contact

12     that resulted in Mr. Snow being added to the Government

13    Relations Database in 1989; isn't that correct?

14         A  What I can tell you is that individuals are just not

15     added to our database. It's permission-based- It requires them

16     to opt in.

n                  Q       Right. And so Mr. Snow would have had to give his

18    permission, correct?

19        A   That's right.

20         Q       And in order for Mr, Snow to give his permission,

21     someone would have to ask his permission, correct? Correct?

22         A  He would have had to provide his permission.

23         q       Right. And there would have to be some kind of form

24     created that he could use to provide his permission, correct?

25         A   Possibly, I  we  I don't know the facts.

1        Q  Well, I mean, you don't think that consumers in 1989

2    were walking around saying let me call R. J. Reynolds in case

3    they have a Government Relations Database reeord so I can get on

4     there, do you?

5        A   I don't know what consumers were walking around and

6    thinking in 1989.

^                  Q  You know that R. J. Reynolds had to do something to let

8    consumers know that this database record existed so that if they

9    were interested they could give their permission to be on it,

10    right?

12        a  sir, what we know from the data that we provided is

13    that Mr. Snow was added in 1989 to the Government Relations

14     Database.

15        Q   Right. And would you tell the jury all of the efforts

16    that you took to find out what R. J. Reynolds did in 1989 to

n          advise consumers or publicise the existenoe and purpose of this

19                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question,

21        answer  well, you can't answer from personal knowledge

22        because.you weren't an employee at the time.

24        a   I don't know.

1     these documents?

2        A  We went through an exhaustive search trying to identify

3     any documentation pertaining to Mr. And Mrs. Snow.

4        Q   Right. Did you do any search to determine what R. J.

5    Reynolds did in 1989 to let smokers know of the existence of

6    this Government Relations Database so that they could give their

7    permission if they wanted?

8        A  We did not locate any information regarding that.

9        Q   Did you look for any information regarding that?

10        A   1 personally did not.

11        Q   Did you ask anyone to?

12        A   Yes.

13         Q       Who?

14        A  Nancy Montgomery.

15        Q       Okay. You asked Nancy Montgomery to go and find out in

16    1989 everything that R. J. Reynolds did to advertise and let

17     consumers know of the existenoe of a Government Relations IB          Database?

20        q        is that your testimony?

21        A  I asked Nancy Montgomery to identify what records we

22     have available pertaining to Mr. And Mrs, Snow on the Government

23     Relations Database.

24         Q   That's different than my question, isn't it, sir?

Q   Let me ask my question again. Did you ask anyone to go out and find whatever records existed as to what steps R. J. Reynolds took in 1989 to reach out to smokers and let them know about this Government Relations Database to obtain their permission to be on it?

MR. BEACH; Objection. Asked and answered.

A  Sir, my request was broader than that. It was to identify and locate any records pertaining to Mr. And Mrs. Snow on the Government Relations Database.

Q  Actually your request was much narrower than what I said, wasn't it?

MR, BEACH: Sir, you're arguing with the witness at

this point.

MR. SOCIAS: No, I'm not. MR. BEACH: Yes, you are. MR. SOCIAS: I'm arguing with you perhaps.

Q   Is that, is that, is your answer complete on that, sir?

A   Yes, it is.

Q   Okay, Now you said Mr. Snow initiated oontaot with the American Tobacco Company in 1990, right?

A   Correct.

Q       And the initiation was signing up to be on a mailing list, correct?

A       That's correct.

Q       Now this signature card isn't something that Mr. Snow

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=185
186

1    went out and had printed up, was it?

2        A   No, Sir.

3        Q   That's something that American Tobacco Company went out

4    and had printed, right? Correct?

5        A   I don't know, I don't know what American Tobacco did

6    and didn't do.

7        Q   So somehow American Tobacco Company ended up with this

8    preprinted signature card that ended up in Mr. Snow's hands and

9    he filled it out, correct?

10        A   Yes.

11        Q   Is that what the research shows?

12        A  Mr. Snow contacted the American Tobacco Company in

13    1990, provided his signature, date of birth. He was age

14    verified by a third party and was added to American Tobacco

15    Company's database.

16        q  Well, I hear you say he contacted. How did Mr. Snow in

17    1990 get that blank signature card to fill out, sir?

18        A   I don't know where he received it from.

1^      Q   Right. In other words, for all you know American

20    Tobacco Company initiated the oontaot by sending him that blank

21    signature card and asking for his permission, right?

22        A   I don't, I don't know what American Tobacco Company

23    did.

24        Q   Exactly. You don't know who initiated that contact in

25    1990, do you?

A  All I know is that Mr. Snow completed, signed out, filled out, provided his signature, age and was, and his  and opted in to being on the American Tobacco Company's database.

Q  Right. Let's go 1992. Tou say Mr. Snow initiated contact with R. J. Reynolds. Again, that's by joining a mailing list?

A  Mr. Snow called R. J, Reynolds in 1992 and requested to be added to the R. J. Reynolds database.

Q  Okay. And that is, which exhibit was that refleoted in?

A   That was reflected in Exhibit 11.

Q   Okay. Let me get Exhibit 11, if I could. Okay. And where does Exhibit 11 indicate that this was a phone call?

A  Under Profile Source CD.

0.   Okay. Hold on. Let me  Profile Source.

A   Code 29.

Q       Source code 29?

A  Source code 29 was referenced and was identified as that is a call to the contact center.

Q   A call and where is, where's 29 identified as a call to the contact center?

A  We identified that through some internal research.

Q   Okay. And where is the document that identifies that code? Do you have that?

A   I don't, I don't believe I have a document that

WWW. USLEGALSUPPORT. COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=187

references that personally.

0   Okay. How this was a, a call that went to what, what pact of R. J. Reynolds?

A  The contact center.

Q   And what was the function of the R. J. Reynolds contact center?

A  To answer phone calls from consumers.

Q  And did R. J. Reynolds advertise the phone number to its oontact center so the consumers could call?

A   I'm not 100 percent certain how, if and how the phone number for the contact center was advertised in 1992.

Q   Okay. And do you know in 1992 how Mr. Snow got the phone number to the R. J, Reynolds oontact center?

A  I do not.

Q   You don't know one way or the other whether R. J. Reynolds sent it to him, do you?

A   I do not know how Mr. Snow obtained the phone number for the contact center.

Q   Right. So you really don't know who initiated that contact in 1992, do you?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A   Mr. Snow, based upon our records, the records show that Mr. Snow called the contact center and requested to be added to the R. J. Reynolds database,

Q  Now you say that Mr. Snow initiated oontact with the

189

1    American Tobacco Company again in 1993, right?

2        A   Yes.

3        Q   And that was to buy a savings bond, right?

4        A   Correct.

5        Q       And let's see, that was Exhibit Number 7, right?

6        A  Correct.

7        Q       And, in fact, Exhibit Number 7 is a document that the

8    American Tobacco Company mailed to Mr. Snow, right, offering him

9    the $50 savings bond?

10        A  That's right. And Mr. Snow signed 

11        Q   Right.

12        A   And Mr. Snow signed and completed that and included all

13    of his information and sent that back to the American Tobacco

14     Company.

15        q  Absolutely. And that contact was initiated by the

16    American Tobacco Company, right?

17                 MR, BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

18        A  All I can tell you is what the data suggests is that

19    Mr. -- this is a copy of what Mr. Snow completed and Mrs. Snow

20    completed and sent back to the American Tobacco Company.

21        Q  Right. Which is a copy of what the American Tobacco

22    Company sent to Ronald Snow, right?

23        a   The American Tobacco Company sent that to Mr. Snow.

24        Q   Right. And by sending that, they initiated this 1993

25    contact that you talked about, right?

1                 MR, BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

2        A  But the initiation started in 1990 when Mr. Snow

3    contacted and provided his signature and date of birth and was

4     age verified. He had already 

5        Q   But now I'm talking about --

8        A   Allow me to finish.

9        q   Oh, I thought you were finished. Go ahead. You want 10         to go back to 1990. I thought we finished there, but go ahead. 13      A   He established, he provided his permission to receive

12    mailings from the American Tobacco Company in 1990. He did not

13    opt out between the period of 1990 and 1993. Therefore,

14    American Tobacco Company sent Mr. Snow this savings bond offer

15    which he completed and returned along with his signature and

16    certification.

17                 MR, SOCIAS: Move to strike.

IB      q   Let's go to 1994. You said that in 1994 Mr. Snow

19    initiated contact with R. J. Reynolds again, right?

20                 MR. BEACHj Sir, what was the basis for the motion

21        to strike?

22                 MR. SOCIAS; It was nonresponsive to my question.

23                 MR. BEACH; It was completely responsive. You were

24        asking who --

Q   You testified, sir, that in 1994 Mr. Snow initiated contact with R. J. Reynolds again, right?

A   No, sir. Mrs., Mrs. Snow initiated contact 

Q   Mrs. Snow?

A    in 1994.

Q Let me leave Mrs. Snow out of this. You testified in in 1997, Mr. Snow initiated contact with Brown and Williamson, right?

A   Correct.

Q   And that he called three times. Now is it, was it your testimony that all the contacts he initiated in 1997 were phone calls?

A  He contacted Brown and Williamson twice in 1997 and once in 1998.

Q   Okay. And what is the exhibit that shows those contacts?

A   Exhibit 10.

Q   Okay. And do you know how in 1997 Mr, Snow got the phone number to Brown and Williamson?

A   No, sir.

1         A  No, sir. All, all our records show is that Mr. Snow

2     contacted Brown and Williamson via phone twice in '97 and once

3     in '98.

4         Q       But as a corporate representative, you don't know

5     whether each of those contacts were invited by Brown and

6    Williamson, do you?

7                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question

8         as to what you mean by invited in this context.

9         A   Sir, all 

10                  MR. BEACH: Do you understand the question that

11         he's asking?

12                  THE WITNESS: No, I don't understand.

13         A  Can you rephrase it?

14         Q   you don't know if Brown and Williamson advertised its

15    phone number and invited Pall Hall smokers to call, do you?

16         A  No. All I know from what the data tells us is that

17     Mr. Snow called three times to Brown and Williamson.

IB      Q   And Mr, Snow would have no way to get those phone

19    numbers unless they were given to him by Brown and Williamson,

20     would he?

21                  MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

22         A   I don't know how Mr. Snow obtained those phone numbers,

23         Q   Then I think you testified that in 2002, Mr. Snow

24     initiated contact again with RJR, correct?

25         A   Correct.

0  And you said he wrote, at least this Exhibit 15 makes a reference to wrote, requesting offers and communications. What exhibit is that referring to?

A   It's referring to Exhibit 12. Q   Okay. Let me get that in front of me. (Phone line was disconnected.)

MR. SOCIAS: We got disconnected. The receiver

went off the hook and that took it off the speaker and I

tried to get it back on speaker. Anyway, we're back

together again.

Q   I have exhibit -

MR. SOCIAS: Is the court reporter taking it down? THE COURT REPORTER: Yes,

Q  Okay. I have Exhibit 12 in front of me. Now Exhibit 12 is, where does Exhibit 12 refer to Mr. Snow writing requesting offers and communications from RJR?

A  Exhibit 12 in the Archive Response upper boxes.

Q        Right.

A  Mr. Snow completed and mailed back the Special Analysis in May of 2002 and again the Doral '02 pack insert, looks like June 14, 2002.

Q  o*y.

A   So he completed those documents, signed them, certified, opted in to receive communications from R. J. Reynolds and thus he started receiving additional communications

from R. J. Reynolds.

Q  Okay. Now in order for Mr, Snow as you said to have signed and mailed back the Special Analysis document, R. J. Reynolds would first need to have provided that Special Analysis document to Mr. Snow for him to fill out and mail back, oorreot?

A  He would've had to  correct. He would've had to obtain it but because he wanted to receive additional, because he wanted to receive communications from R, J. Reynolds, he completed them and signed them and opted in to receive communications.

Q  And R. J. Reynolds specifically had a document printed up so that people that were interested in communications could get them, correct?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

It was not clear to me what you were referring to.

A  Could you rephrase the question, please?

Q   Sure. The Special Analysis document is something that R. J. Reynolds had printed up, correct?

A   I'm not sure if it was Reynolds  I don't know the answer to that, sir.

0  well, it's under RJRT Responses. You think someone else, it may be someone else's Special Analysis document?

A  No, sir. What I was trying to clarify, I don't want to give you erroneous information. I don't know if an alternate third-party may have been responsible for that.

Q       You mean some third-party may have printed it?

A  Correct.

Q   Right. I'm assuming a printer printed it, but it was printed for R. J. Reynolds, wasn't it?

A  I'm not 100 percent certain on, on what that document was other than that it was returned by Mr. Snow.

Q   Well, if you don't know what it was, how do you know Mr. Snow was making a request to get anything from R. J. Reynolds by sending it back?

A   I'm just looking for some supporting documents. Well, he provided his, on that record, you notice that he provided his signature and there was also some additional brand information captured which is consistent with opting in to receive mailings.

Q  Are we looking at a document with a signature that was a Special Analysis document?

A   Yes. Under the Signature column, it's flagged with a

y.

Q       Okay. What exhibit are you looking at?

A   Twelve still.

Q   Oh, I'm sorry. There's a signature column here somewhere?

A   Yes, sir. It's just passed right of center, Q       in the top block?

A   Yes, If you, you'll see the date and then there is a big long code of numbers and then there's something that looks

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=195

1     like 98 and then there's a Y and the Y indicates that a

2    signature was returned with this response from Mr. Snow,

3        Q       Right. Mr. Snow was responding to something that had

4    been provided to him by R. J, Reynolds, correct?

5        A  Again, 1 don't know if it was a R. J. Reynolds specific

6    document. All we know is that we received a response from 1          Mr. Snow on that document entitled Special Analysis.

8        Q   Okay. Mr. Snow was responding to something, correct?

9        A  Correct. Mr. Snow responded by mailing in, signing

10    whatever this document was back to R. J. Reynolds.

11        Q  And do you know who it was that was responsible for

12    getting this document into Mr. Snow's hands in the first place

13    bo that he could fill it in and respond to it?

14        A  I don't know who, who gave that document to Mr. Snow.

15        Q   Do you think it was likely R. J. Reynolds?

16        A  I don't want to speculate, sir. I don't know who may

17     have given it to him.

3 8      Q       You think Philip Morris may have done it?

19        A   Sir, as I mentioned before, I don't know who gave that

20    document to Mr. Snow.

21        Q  Whoever gave that document to Mr. Snow is the person

22     that initiated this round of contact, wasn't it?

23                 MR. BEACH: Objection. That's argumentative and

24         inaccurate. Excuse me. Misstates the witness's testimony.

A   Sir, again, all the records show for the communications to and from Mr. Snow is that we received that document,

Q Right. But my question was different than that. Whoever it was that handed that document or provided that document to Mr. Snow in the first place is the party that initiated this round of contact; isn't that correct?

A  The initiation in this case begins when Mr. Snow opts in to receive communications. Nothing happens downstream after he provides his signature and agrees to receive communications from any tobacco company.

Q   And he doesn't provide his signature and fill out a form unless someone gives the form to him to begin with; isn't that right?

A  If he didn't want communications, he wouldn't have initiated contact by providing his signature and opting in.

Q  And if R. J. Reynolds didn't want to send him the coupons, they wouldn't have sent him the form to fill out; isn't that right?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A   Can you restate your question, please?

Q   Ho. Can you answer my question?

A   I didn't understand it,

Q   That's fine. We'll let the jury evaluate that. MR. BEACH: There's nothing to evaluate.

Q   R. J. Reynolds spent money printing these coupons that

1    it was sending Mr. Snow; isn't that right?

2        A   Correct.

3        Q  R. J. Reynolds spent money preparing these signature

4     sheets that Mr. Snow sent in to R. J. Reynolds to get coupons;

5         isn't that right?

6        A  I don't, I don't know that for sure.

7        Q   Okay. Why did R. J. Reynolds send coupons to Mr. Snow? MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

That's outside the scope of the notice. And you, if you

10        have any personal knowledge, Mr. Setchell, you can answer

11        but not as a corporate representative.

12        Q   Sir?

13        A  The only  R. J. Reynolds sent coupons to Mr. Snow

14    because he requested them, signed, provided his signature, opted

15    in, was certified and age verified and said he wanted to

16    receive 

17        Q  What was in it for R. J. Reynolds to send those coupons 19          to Mr. Snow?

19                 MR. BEACH: Wait a second. Sir, yet again, I'm

20        sure quite unintentionally, you interrupted the witness.

21                 MR. SOCIAS: Oh, it wasn't intentional. I thought

22        he was done.

23                Q       I'm sorry.    Go ahead, sir.

24                                  MR. BEACH:    I know you've always thought he was

25                done, but ma'am,  could you please repeat the question so the

(QUESTION WAS READ BACK BY COURT REPORTER) Q   Let me withdraw the question and I'll try and ask it and get to this a different way. Mr. Snow wasn't the only smoker getting coupons from R. J, Reynolds, was he?

A  Sir, I'm prepared to discuss the communications to and from Mr, And Mrs. Snow. Outside of that  Q       lf J, l  appreciate that.

MR. BEACH: Sir, sir  Q   My question is 

MR. BEACH: Sir  Q   Mr. Snow was not the only smoker getting ooupons from R. J. Reynolds, was he?

MR. BEACH: Sir, you again unintentionally interrupted the witness before he completed his answer.

MR. SOCIAS: The witness had completed his answer. Come on.

MR. BEACH: He had not. MR. SOCIAS: Okay.

MR. BEACH: You need to go back. If you have the question, you can answer the question.

A   Sir, I am prepared to discuss the communications to and from Mrs. Snow as the data we have available to us presents itself.

1    to any smokers other than Ronald Snow. Is that your testimony?

2                 MR. BEACH: Sir, I object to the question. It's

3        outside the scope of the notice. It's also outside the

4        scope of my examination. So it's improper on both of those

5        grounds. He can't address this issue as a corporate

6        representative, only on the basis of his personal knowledge.

7        it seems to me at this point, this is just interposed for

8        harassment purposes.

9        Q   Hay I have an answer?

10                 MR. BEACH; If you can respond based upon personal

11        experience, do you know whether or not Reynolds has sent

12        coupons to consumers?

13        A  Based upon personal experience, Reynolds sends coupons

14    to adult tobacco consumers who are age verified, certified and

15    have opted in and told us they want to receive communications,

16        q  And does Reynolds do this as a charity or does it do

17     this because it feels it's good for business?

18                 MR. BEACH: Objection. Same, same instruction.

19        This is outside the scope of the 

20        q   Okay. Let me withdraw the question. Let me ask it a

21    different way. Why does Reynolds send coupons to adult

22    consumers that are interested in getting them?

23                 MR, BEACH: Same objection. Mr. Socias, these are

24        all obviously well outside the scope of the notice, number

25        one. Number two, they're outside the scope of my

examination.

MR. SOCIAS: I disagree, but be that as it may,

there's my question.

MR. BEACH: If you can answer based upon personal

knowledge and not as a corporate representative, Mr.

Setchell, please go ahead.

A  Can you repeat the question, please?

Q   Sure. Why does R. J. Reynolds send ooupons to adult smokers?

A  Of those, those adult smokers that again have provided their signature, been age verified, certified and told us they want to receive communications, we, we're building a relationship with them. They've asked for them. We provide coupons and other communications to our consumers.

Q  And you do that because it's good for business, right? MR. BEACH: Same objections.

Q   Right?

A   Sir, it's a permission-based database. Again 

Q   No question about it.

A   No, no. Let me, let me 

Q   You've said that 300 tines. My question is different. My question is this. You do that because it's good for business, right?

MR. BEACH: Okay, sir. You I'm sure

unintentionally yet again interrupted the witness. So, Mr.

202

1        Setchell, if you want to have the question read back and

2        answer fully, please do so. Otherwise, Mr. Socias could

3        withdraw the question,

4        A  Could you read that one back to me, please?

5        Q       I'll ask the question again. You do that because it's

6    good for business; isn't that correct?

7                 MR. BEACH: Again, I would object to the form of

B      the question. It's outside the scope of the notice. It's 9      outside the scope of my examination. To the extent that you

10        can answer on behalf of personal knowledge as to why

11        Reynolds engages in these kinds of programs, feel free to

12        answer his question.

13        A   Again, it's a permission-based database. This is a

14    competitive market, right. They're several competitors

15    competing for business. We're simply trying to build

16    relationships with our consumers that have opted in, that have

17    been age verified, that have been certified and said they wanted

18     to receive communications from us. It's part of building that

19    relationship. Companies, companies do relationship marketing

20    and programs all the time. It's nothing unusual.

21        Q   And the reason why companies engage in relationship

22    marketing is to increase profits, isn't it?

23                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

24        This is way outside the scope of the notice. To the extent

25        that you have personal knowledge about why companies engage

2        corporate representative, but feel free to respond.

3        A  Sir, again, this is not  I've, I'm fully prepared to

4     discuss the communications to and from Mr. And Mrs. Snow, This

5     is out of my area that I've prepared for with this deposition.

6        Q       Well, you're an MBA, And you're in charge of a f         marketing department at R. J. Reynolds, aren't you?

8                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

9        It misstates his testimony.

10        Q   isn't that right, sir?

11                 MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

12        A  I have, I have an MBA and I'm the senior director of

13    one to one communications.

14        Q  Can you think of any reason why a company would engage

15    in relationship marketing other than to improve its bottom line,

16    to improve its business?

17        A  Well, from my standpoint and my area of responsibility

18     is really is truly the operational side of one to one

19    communications. From our, from one to one communications

20    position, consumers, again, it's permission-based. They have

21     opted in. They've been aged verified. They told us they want

22     to receive communications and we fulfill that request. It's

23     something they have asked us for.

24        Q  And I'm just going to ask you. Would you tell the jury

25    whether that's the most direot and honest answer you're able to

2                  MR. BEACH: I object. That's argumentative. You

3         don't have to respond to that kind of question/ sir. Are

4         you done, Mr. Socias?

5                  MR. SOCIAS: No, I'd like an answer to that. I'm,

6         I'm very serious.

7                  MR, BEACH: He's not going to -- your question is

8         completely argumentative, sir.

9                  MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Then, then I'm done.

10                  MR. BEACH: All right. I have a couple 

11                  MR. SOCIAS: Oh, I'm not done. I have another 

12         hold on one second. Okay. I have just a couple of

13         questions.

14         Q  Mr. Setohell, you referred several times to individuals

15     sudh as Mr. Snow opting in by filling out these signature oards,

16     signature forms. Do you recall that?

17         a  Yes, sir.

IS                   Q   And anywhere on those oards, is the consumer advised

19     that by signing R. J. Reynolds is going to track any personal

20     information such as where he redeems coupons, how many coupons

21     he redeems, what stores he frequents to redeem coupons and so

22     on? Is that, is that disclosed anywhere on anything that the

23     consumer signs?

24                A       Let me review some documents. 23               Q        Sure.    Are we still connected?

A  Yes, sir.

MR. BEACH: He's reviewing some of the exhibits. MR. SOCIAS: Okay, That's fine.

A Sir, what I can tell yqu is that based on what I've seen so far is that consumers are told that, that the direct mail list is not sold to other companies.

Q  Okay. Does that complete your answer?

A  That seems to be the information provided to consumers when they, when they sign their name on these.

Q  Okay. Is a consumer anywhere advised that their age is going to be verified through some third-party means?

A  Sir, based on the information that I have in front of me, I do not notice that anything states that age will be third-party verified.

Q   Okay.

A  It just simply states that signature and birth date are required and that they must certify that they're a smoker, 21 years of age or older and they want to receive in the mail offers, premiums and/or coupons.

Q   Okay, thank you. Mow, is there any policy or prooedure in place at R. J. Reynolds as to whether or not a wife oan have her husband removed from the permission database?

A   In order to be removed from the database, all the Snows, as it states on the direct mail pieces, could have written remove me and return, then return mail to the address

that's list -- the return address in Richardson, Texas and Mr. Snow would have been removed from the mailing list.

Q   Right. That'8 all Mr. Snow would've had to do. But there's no procedure for Mrs. Snow or any other third-party removing Mr. Snow from the database, is there?

A I'm not, I'm not prepared to speak to the specific policy regarding removal from an individual that is not the individual that the mailing is addressed to.

Q   Okay. And I think you testified that there was a record of Mr. Snow having redeemed $147.50 in coupons. Do you

remember that?

A   Yes, sir.

Q  Now that only includes coupons that were keyed to his profile, unique profile number or ID or name, right?

A  Those were the coupons that were keyed to his customer

ID.

Q  Right. It doesn't include coupons that were not keyed

to the customer ID, right?

MR. BEACH: Object to the form of the question.

Q   Right, sir?

A  I don't, I don't know if he received any coupons that weren't, without, that didn't have his personal identification

number.

Q  Hell, I mean, you know, that R. J. Reynolds printed up

4        outside the scope of the notice. And to the extent you have

5        personal knowledge and can respond that way, but then please

6        do, Mr. Setchell. But that's outside the scope of the

9        A  Sir, I don't know how many coupons, if any, were

10    printed without the personal identification, identifying number

12        q  Right. Okay. Now you testified that you did some work

13    for, was it innovative products, is that  am I using the right

14     terminology?

15        A  I was in a department or function called innovations.

17    subject of addiction?

18                 MR. BEACH: Sir, this question is outside the scope

19        of my examination.

20        Q   I will try and tie it together. Did it deal with the

21     subject of addiction at all?

22        A  Sir, I am prepared to discuss the communications

6         A   Communications sent to Mr. Snow, as I stated already,

7     carried the government mandated Surgeon General warning rotated

8     quarterly as dictated by the FTC.

9                  MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Move to strike.

11     produced or any document that was produced wherein R, J,

12    Reynolds or any of its predecessors had advised Mr. Snow that

13     Pall Mall cigarettes are addictive?

14                  MR. BEACH: Objection, It's asked and answered now

15         twice and it's also

11        Q   Anything unusual about an addict contacting its source

12    of drugs which he's addicted to?

13                 MR. BEACH: Mr. Socias, are you done with your

14         serious questions because 

15                 MR. SOCIAS: Oh, that's a very serious question.

16        That's a very serious question. Let me tell you, an

17        addiction killed a man here with cancer. It is very serious

18        to addict someone, then have him die of cancer and then

19        cavalierly play games with the questions that I'm asking.

20        Yeah, I think it's a very serious question.

MR. BEACH: Objection. That question is purely argumentative and just interposed for harassment purposes. You don't have to respond to that, sir.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Then that's all I have. MR. BEACH: I have a few last questions based upon Mr. Socias1 questions. I apologize for further intrusion on your day today, Mr. Setchell.

MR. SOCIAS: I'm sorry. I can't hear what you're saying.

MR. BEACH: I was just apologizing to Mr. Setchell for the further intrusion on his time. I need to ask a few final questions.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. That's fine. I just couldn't hear what you were saying. EXAMINATION BY MR. BEACH:

Q   Okay. First of all, I just really want to clarify a couple simple issues. Mr. Sooias has asked about the existence of coupons being redeemed by Mr. Snow that were not ooded to his, to any particular ID number that he may have received from either American, Brown and Williamson or Reynolds. Do you have any evidence whatsoever that he ever redeemed such coupons? MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object to the form. A   I have no  the data that we have which I believe to be, to the best of my knowledge, complete and accurate, nothing  the reason we have redemption data is because it was

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=211
212

1     PID'D to him. I have no evidence and all of the data suggests

2     that he redeemed coupons that were not personally identifiable

3     to Mr. And Mrs. Snow,

4        Q   And in your answer, you just said PID'D to him. What

5    did you 

6        A   I'm sorry.

7        q   spell that and tell us what that means.

8        A   PID apostrophe D and it's an abbreviation for personal

9     identify number. Similar to what we saw earlier, Brown and

10    Williamson called it customer ID, personal ID, all synonyms.

11        Q   Okay. Next, Mr. Sodas asked you whether or not the

12    companies disclosed to consumers that they were subject to age

13    verification. Let me ask a related question. Why do the

14     companies age verify people seeking to join their direot

15    marketing databases like Mr. Snow did?

16                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to form.

17        A  Age verification is done as added precaution to ensure

18     that one, we're sending communications to the individual that

19    had opted in, signed and said that they wanted to receive

20    communications. It's also to ensure that we're not marketing to

21     anyone under 21 years of age.

22        Q   Okay. Next, Mr. Sodas asked a variety of questions

23    based on demonstrative number 15 that, or Exhibit IS, the

24    demonstrative summarising the contacts of Mr. And Mrs. Snow with

25    Reynolds. Do you recall that?

A   Yes, sir.

Q   And there seemed to be some confusion on his part as to how this process works refloated in his questions. In other words, he was asking questions to the effect well, did  they created the form so isn't it true that Reynolds initiated the contact, things like that. Do you recall questions of that nature?

A   Yes, sir.

Q  Okay. Sort of perhaps once and for all, can you please describe to us --

MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object to that long, long

prelude and introduction about me being confused, et cetera.

If you would, just ask the question.

MR. BEACH: Okay. Well, your  okay. Well, I

suppose your questions will speak for themselves, won't

they, sir?

MR. SOCIAS: Absolutely. MR. BEACH:  Exactly.

Q   Mow the basic process that we're talking about here with a permission-based system, did Reynolds or Brown and Williamson or American Tobacco ever pick up the phone and call Mr. Snow?

A   No.

MR. SOCIAS:    Object to the form.    Asked and

answered,  argumentative and leading.

Q  Do you have any evidence, sir, that R. J. Reynolds, American Tobacco or Brown and Williamson ever picked up the phone and called Mr. Snow?

A  We have no records.

MR, SOCIAS: Same objection.

A  On the data that we have, there are no records of outbound phone calls from the tobacco company to Mr. Snow.

Q   if a phone call was made, who dialed the number to initiate the call?

MR. SOCIAS; I'm going to object to the form,

A  The dialer.

Q   All right. And do we have any evidence that the dialer was anyone other than Mr. Snow?

MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

A  No, sir. No, sir. Mr. Snow we have records of Mr. Snow making all those phone calls to Brown and Williamson as well as R. J. Reynolds.

Q   And when it came to not calling  by the way, if one wants to find a telephone number, have you ever heard of a publication called a phone book?

MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

A   Yes, sir.

Q   Okay. And if you actually look at the mailings to Mr. Snow, the exemplars that you have provided Plaintiff's Counsel, do they also contain telephone numbers for R. J.

1    Reynolds if a consumer wants to contact the company?

2                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

3        A  Yes, they include phone numbers for R. J. Reynolds and

4    Brown and Williamson.

5        Q   So, and then when it came to actually picking up the

6    phone and dialing the phone number, whose decision was it? 1                  A   Mr. Snow's.

8                 MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object to the form.

9        Q   Now when it came to sending in the certification cards

10    and, by the way, on Exhibit 15, there is a box that says

11     Certification in it. Are these the three, the three bullet

12    points there, is that the basic content of the certifications

13     that Mr. Snow responded to based upon your review of all the

14     records?

15                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

16        q   Can you tell me whether or not the certification is or 1*7          is not the kind of information that Mr. Snow would have provided

18    when he was contacting Reynolds, American and Brown and

19    Williamson?

20                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to form.

21        A  That's correct. He would have stated that he was a

22     current tobacco consumer, that he was the legal age of 21 or

23     older and that he did want to receive offers and communications.

24        q  And so, for example, then you were asked a series of

25    questions by Mr. Sodas, for example, with respect to the

savings bond program. How is it that Mr, Snow came to receive the offer to sign up for the savings bond program?

MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

A  Well, in 1990, Mr. Snow contacted the American Tobacco Company and was certified as a tobacco consumer, 21 or older and that he wanted to receive offers in the mail from the American Tobacco Company.

Q  And if Mr. Snow had never contacted American Tobacco Company in 1990, you have any reason to believe based upon the records that you have reviewed that he would have received the savings bond program offer?

MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

A I have no reason  no, I have no reason to believe that he would have received it had he not contacted American Tobacco Company in 1990.

Q   The certification that a consumer fills out, I believe you previously had have indicated, tells the company that I want to receive offers, coupons or promotional materials; is that correct?

A   Correct.

MR. SOCIAS: Object to form.

Q   So with respect to the, then the materials that were received, is that because they had received the certification where they asked to be sent things or is there some other reason at play here?

1                 MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object to the form,

2        A   The only reason Mr, And Mrs. Snow were ever sent

3    anything from the tobacco companies is because they completed a

4     card and requested to be age verified, certified and receive

5    communications from the tobacco companies.

6        Q  Based on the totality of your research for this

?          deposition and including the hours devoted by your staff, what

8    is the reason why Mr. And Mrs. Snow received conmunioations from

9    Reynolds, American or Brown and Williamson?

10                 MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object to the form.

11        A  Mr. And Mrs. Snow received communications from the

12    American Tobacco Company, Brown and Williamson and/or R, J.

13    Reynolds because they provided their signature that they opted

14     in to receive, told us, told the respective tobacco companies

15    that they wanted to receive mailings and offers and coupons in

16    the mail.

17        Q       And returning to Exhibit 16, the Plaintiff's deposition IB         in this case wherein she testified as an admission that the only

19    thing that she thought any tobacco company ever did wrong to her

20    husband was to send him coupons, why did Mr. Snow receive those

21    ooupons in the first place?

22        A   Because he asked for them.

23                 MR. BEACH: I have nothing further.

24                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

25                 MR. BEACH: We're done. Thank you.

2    EXAMINATION BY MR, SOCIAS:

3        Q  Mr. Setchell, X think every signature card that we saw

4     that Mr. Snow filled out had a space for his phone number,

5    didn't it?

6        A  I don't recall. Let me go and look through them.

7      Q       Okay. Well, you recall R. J. Reynolds 

8                 MR. BEACH: Excuse me, excuse me. Sir, sir.

9        Excuse me. You've got to give the witness a chance to now

10        review the record that you've just referred to, please.

11                 MR. SOCIAS: Oh, I was just trying to speed it up.

12        That's fine.

13                 MR. BEACH: It's not speeding it up.

14        A  Yes, sir. I noticed that the exemplars that we have do

15    contain a phone number,

16        Q       Right. And Exhibit A, pardon me, Exhibit 3, for

17    Mr. Snow, that has his phone number on it, doesn't it?

18        A   Yes, in the database record for Brown and Williamson

19    archive does capture a phone number.

20        q   Okay. And Exhibit 6, that signature card Mr. Snow

21    filled out, that has a space for his phone number, doesn't it?

22        A   Yes, sir.

23        Q  And Exhibit 7 that savings bond form, that has a space

24     for the phone number, doesn't it?

25        A   Yes, sir.

number,

A
	I'm sorry. Which one is Exhibit 14?

Q   It's a document that has Ronald Snow. It's one of those signature cards, I believe. It's the one that was dated 1998.

A   Yes, sir.

Q   Okay. That has a phone number as well, right?

A   Correct.

Q   Now why did R. J. Reynolds keep asking Mr. Snow for his phone number if it never wanted to call hia?

A  I don't know why that information was requested. I don't know if it was ever used. Based upon the records that we have, we have, we show no records of any calls being made to Mr. Snow.

Q   And you don't know whether, what the policy was as to

WWW. USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240

keeping track of calls it may or nay not have been made to Mr. Snow, do you?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form. Misstates the

witness's testimony.

A  Based on the information that we have identified with records relating to Mr. Snow, we do not have any information or any evidence to demonstrate that phone calls were made from R. J. Reynolds to Mr. Snow.

Q  But do you know whether R. J. Reynolds had any policy in place to record phone calls that they initiated as opposed to phone calls that they received?

A  I am not aware of what the policy states. All I can tell you is that based upon the records that we have from Mr. And Mrs. Snow, nothing indicates that any outbound phone calls were made to Mr, Snow.

Q       Okay.

A  They were all him contacting Reynolds.

MR. SOCIAS: Okay. Move to strike. Thank you,

sir. That's all I have.

MR. BEACH: Okay. Sorry. I'm going to do this

real quickly. EXAMINATION BY MR. BEACH:

Q  Now, first of all, have you ever in your entire work experience at Reynolds ever heard of Reynolds initiating a call to a consumer as opposed to the other way around?

1                 MR. SOCIAS: Object to the form.

2        q   Based on his personal knowledge.

3        A   Not initiating. We  if a consumer calls with an

4     issue or a complaint and it requires some investigation, we will

5    call Lhcm back with an answer.

6        Q       And, in fact, if we look at the exhibit in this case

7    concerning his call to Brown and Williamson that you've talked

8    about now, it's Exhibit 10, right?

9        A   Yes, sir.

10        Q  Did, did, when, when Brown and Williamson didn't

11    receive the signature card that you've told us they asked for

12    here, he called asking for coupons. Then he called back a month

13    later says, where are my coupons and they said your signature

14     card hasn't been keyed in yet and he said he mailed it. You

15    remember all that?

16        A   Uh-huh, yes. n     q  so 

18                 MR. SOCIAS: Let me object to the form there. Now

19        go ahead.

20        Q       Okay. Well, what I'm trying to do here is this. Does

21    Exhibit 10  referring to Counsel's question was why does

22    Reynolds or all these other companies I presume ask for phone

23    numbers. Does this record indicate that even though they were

24    missing information from Mr. Snow, they initiated the oall baok

25    to him?

MR. SOCIAS: I'm going to object to the form.

A  No, sir. If they would have called, he wouldn't have called back asking why he didn't receive his coupons,

0  And let's go to Mr. Sodas' questions about why does the company ask for telephone numbers, When it comes to the age verification process, explain to Mr. Socias how the age verification process works. Howr how does the, how does that analytically work so that you know whether or not you have matching records and  I'll leave it at that,

A  The age verification process if a, if a physical, if age verification cannot be conducted by in person meaning I'm standing with you, you provide me with a government ID, photo ID and I can verify that that is you, that's one way to do age verification. The other way is when we get information or like in this case request to be on the database. Personal information, first name, last name, address, phone number, last four, today it's last four digits of Social Security number are all used and bounced up along with date of birth are used and compared to records such as financial information, Department of Motor Vehicles, some of the credit bureaus, all of those individual data components are matched to ensure that the information provided is accurate and the person that provided the information is who they claim they are. So components like phone number as well as address and date of birth could all have been used to, as part of the age verification process.

1                 MR. BEACH: Okay. I don't have anything further.

2                 MR. SOCIAS: Oh, I've got a little bit.

3    EXAMINATION BY MR, SOCIAS:

4        q  Does the Department of Motor Vehicles keep track of, of

5    telephone numbers, sir?

6                 MR. BEACH: Object to the form of the question.

7        Which Department of Motor Vehicles are you referring to,

8        sir?

9        0   Whichever department you check on.

10        A   Sir, I'm not aware of what the Department of Motor

11    Vehicles keeps in hand.

12                 MR. BEACH: Why don't you explain to him how the ~

13        Q   And do you do credit searches, credit checks on

14    everybody that fills out one of these little signature cards and

15    asks for coupons?

16                 MR. BEACH: Object to the form of the question.

17        A   Sir, sir, I, I didn't state that we did credit checks.

18        Q   In fact, you don't need anything more than a name and Id         an address to verify someone's age if you wanted to run some

20    kind of a search, do you?

21                 MR. BEACH: That's  okay. Excuse me. That's

22        argumentative. Objection to the form of the question.

23        Q   Do you, sir?

24        A   Sir, we  for our process to be effective and

data components, things like phone number, last four of Social Security number. So that we can match that individual to that date of birth to ensure that they are 21 or older.

Q   Have you ever boon involved in verifying ago?

A  Only face-to-face.

Q   Okay. Do you have any knowledge as to specifioalXy what is done to verify age when it's not done face-to-faoe?

A  Yes, I just described that process.

Q       Okay. And how did you learn that that was the process?

A  When I assumed this role back in May, that was one of the pieces of learning this role that I acquired.

Q   Okay. And were you speoifioally told that phone numbers were used as part of verifying someone's age?

A  All of those data elements  yes. Yes, I was. All of those data elements are used.

Q  Okay. Who told you that phone numbers were speoifically used to verify age?

A   it's in a document referring to our age verification process.

Q   Okay. And when did the policies in that document take effect?

A   1 don't know the exact date of when that process was enacted. I believe -- it was some time in -- I don't, I don't know, sir. All I can tell you is from the records that we have looking through the American Tobacco records as wel] as Brown

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=224
225

and Williamson, third-party age verification was occurring as far back as 1990.

Q   Okay. That really wasn't my question. Mjy question was different. When did the policy of, that you just described, of using phone numbers as part of age verification take effect?

A   That I don't know, sir.

Q       Okay. Now is it your testimony that a phone number is necessary to verify age if you have someone's name and address?

A  No, that's not my testimony.

Q   Okay. Now if you know 

A   I'm not finishing answering the question. As I mentioned before, there's multiple pieces of data provided for age verification, name, address, phone number, date of birth, last four of Social Security number. All of those or some of those can be used against third-party databases to verify that that individual is who they are and at least 21 years of age or older.

Q  And is it your testimony that the address information regarding the consumers was also used only for the purpose of verifying age?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A   No, that's not my testimony.

Q_   Right. You used the address to send coupons, right? MR. BEACH: Objection to the form of the question.

A  Of consumers that have provided their  again,

consumers provided their information, they've certified that they're a tobacco consumer at least 21 years of age or older and want to receive communications in the mail.

Q   Right, And you sent those communications using the contact information they have provided to you, right? A   Yes, sir.

Q  And you didn't mean to suggest that that information was used only for age verification, did you?

MR. BEACH: Objection to the form. He never stated that, sir. That's a misstatement,

MR. SOCIAS: Exactly, I just want to make sure he didn't suggest that.

MR. BEACH: It's your own suggestion. It's a mistake in the record.

MR. SOCIAS: I don't want to argue with you. Just let the witness answer the question and we'll be done. MR. BEACH: Well, it's argumentative, sir. MR. SOCIAS: I hear you. A  Sir, I never stated that address information from adult tobacco consumers opting in to receive communications was only used for age verification. Obviously, since we're mailing communications to consumers, we need that mailing address to do so.

Q  And you don't know that phone numbers were only used for age verification either, do you?

WWW.USLEGALSUPPORT.COM 1-888-311-4240pgNbr=226
227

A  No, sir. I can tell you that based upon these records, we have no records of using the Snows* phone numbers for any purpose other than capturing them in the database.

MR. SOCIAS: Move to strike the last part of that. Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.

THE COURT REPORTER: All right. This is the court reporter. Mr. Socias, do you want a copy of this transcript?

MR. SOCIAS: I will -- probably yes. Let me, let me think on that.

THE COURT REPORTER: Okay.

MR. SOCIAS: Karen will be in touch and place the order. We've got your information.

THE COURT REPORTER: Thank you.

MR. BEACH: We definitely want a copy.

Reynolds makes the following Recurring Objections to the Requests ("Running Objections'*). The Recurring Objections set forth below are Incorporated, as appropriate, Into eaeh of Reynolds'responses to the Requests, A.       Scope And Relevance

Reynolds objects to Plaintiffs Requests to the extent that they are overly broad In scope and seek discovery concerning matters that are neither relevant (o this artion nor reasonably oalcuiated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. Reynolds bases these objections, In part, to the extent the Requests purport to seek Information unlimited as to time or pertaining to time periods that Ronald Snow did not smoke cigarettes and/or smoke Reynolds' products,pgNbr=273

Including time period* beyond November 21,1996, the deadline for qualification as a member of the former En$h class, Reynolds farther objects to these Requests to the extent they attempt to Impose obligations other then those imposed or authorized by the Florida Rule* of Civil Procedure and/or any order of the Court, Reynolds further objects to the Requests on the -ground* that they are premature and unduly burdensome beoauso the Court has not yet determined the effect on this cue, if any, of certain finding* made in Etigle v, Llggatt Group, Ino., 945 So,2d 1246 (Fla. 2006). Such a determination will affect both the issues to be tried in this ease and the admissibility of evidence, B,      Overbreadth and Undue Burden

Reynolds objects to the Requests in their entirety on the (round! they ovoriy broad end unduly burdensome to the extent they purport to require Reynolds to engage in a wide-ranging, excessively time-consuralng, and unreasonably costly effort to locate potentially reaponaive document*, In pertinent part* PlatatirTa Requests seek documents pertaining to communication* from Ronald Snow to Reynolds and promotional communications from Reynolds to Ronald Snow. While Reynolds maintains consumer information systems which oontain certain information of type sought by various of the Requests, the database is not "Jinked" to the precise communication* or documents exchanged between adult tobacco ooasumera and Reynolds. Moreover, in many if not most instances the database dow not pontalii Information which is sufficient to enable Reynolds to precisely Identify the promotional material that was Bent to adult tobacco consumers, As a result, in order to determine whether a responsive document exists, in most instances Reynolds would have to access warehoused material from offsite facilities and review the available marketing or promotional materials to determine whether any of them match a particular item referenced in Its database, whloh in some cases will

bo impossible, As a rcsaill, tho burden and expense of identifying many of the document* sought by Plaintiff substantially outweighs am/ probative value they might have and therefore is unjustifiable, C.     Preemption

Reynolds object* to the Request* to the extent that they seek documents regarding Reynolds' advertising Mid promotional practices ud activities after July 1,1969. .In Cipolhm v. Liggett Grow Ino,t 505 US. 504 (1992), the United States Supreme Court held to be preempted claims based on the ordinary advertising or promotion of cigarettes labeled in accordance with federal law, as well as claims alleging failure to warn and claim* alleging that cigarette advertising or promotion "neutralized the effect of federally mandated warning labels,** Id at 527. In addition to conflict preemption under the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act ("FCLAA") as set forth in Cpollone, the United States Supreme Court has articulated field preemption in two cases, Lortllwd Tobacco Co, v, Mifyt 533 U.S. 525 (2001), and FDA v, Brown & Williamson Totem Corp,, 529 US. 120 (2000). Discovery which relates only to claims which Platotiffmay not as a matter of law pursue seeks information that is neither relevant to this action nor reasonably calculated to lead to the disoovery of admissible evidence. 1).      Eitraterriterialify and Nexns to Plaintiff

Reynolds object* to Plaintiff i Requests to the extent that they seek discovery regarding Reynolds' activities j jurisdictions that are unrelated to Plaintiffs alleged injuries, Information regarding Reynolds' oonduct that did not result In harm to Plaintiff is irrelevant to the issues of Reynolds1 liability to Plaintiff and/or compensatory damages and, as such, is not reasonably calculated to lead to the disoovery of admissible evldenoe. Information regarding Reynolds* extraterritorial conduct unrelated to Plaintiffs alleged injuries is similarly irrelevant to the issues
