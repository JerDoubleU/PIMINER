THE COURT:  Good morning.

MR. HARRISON:  Your Honor, can we approach. (At the bench.)

MR. HARRISON:  I think as a practical matter, we should put the podium where we had it before we started jury selection, back there, to keep everybody out of the way of the jury.  I know the last trial, he stood in between the jury.

THE COURT:  I will tell you what.  If Mr. Wichmann -- I will let you be wherever you want to be, and I will let Mr. Wichmann be wherefore he wants to be.

MR. HARRISON:  Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. WICHMANN:  Thanks, Judge. (In open court.)

MR. WICHMANN:  Folks, before we get started this morning, I wanted to tell you that Jan Rounds got sick last night with the stomach flu.  She won't be here today, but she should be back Tuesday.

DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Dr. Hurt?

A.   Good morning.

Q.   Good morning.  I think I'm going to start

here, if it doesn't -- if it doesn't work here, I might move over there.  But please tell the jury your name.

A.   I'm Richard Dale Hurt.

Q.   What is your present position?

A.   I am retired and having fun with my grandkids.

Q.   Well, tell the jury about that.  Are you married?

A.   Am I married?

Q.   Yes.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  And do you have children and grandchildren?

A.   I have three children and seven grandchildren.

Q.   Okay.  And where do you reside?

A.   Rochester, Minnesota.

Q.   All right.  Give the jury the benefit of your educational background, please.

A.   So I went to high school in Murray, Kentucky, and went to Murray State University to college.  After that, I went to the University of Louisville to medical school, did one year of internship in Memphis at Baptist Memorial Hospital, had two years in the Army, and then I went to Rochester to be a fellow in internal

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=6
1427

medicine at Mayo Clinic and went on the staff in 1976. Q.   Would you tell the jury what you did when you were in the U.S. Army?

A.   I was in Army Depot in Richard, Kentucky.  I was what was called the post surgeon, though I don't do surgery.  I'm an internist.  That's what the title was. I oversaw all the medical care for both the military and civilians in Army Depot in Richard, Kentucky.

MR. WICHMANN:  Can you-all hear him okay?

A JUROR:  Yes. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Tell the jury what an internist does. A.   Well, internal medicine is a specialty of adults.  It's not pediatrics.  It's nonsurgical.  We don't do operations, we don't do baby deliveries. That's for obstetricians.  So it's really focused on adult medicine.  And the range goes from everything from upper respiratory infections to influenzas to pneumonias to all kinds of different cancers.  So it spreads out the spectrum of medicine.

And I, in my -- beginning of my career, I was a primary care internist, so I did primary care for patients from the community.  So I was their main doctor, and they came to me with whatever condition that they had.

pgNbr=7
1428

Q.   Okay.  Are you board certified in internal medicine?

A.   I am.

Q.   And tell the jury what that means.

A.   Well, board certification for any specialty, but specific for internal medicine, requires you to have three years of training after medical school.  And I have four.  And then you have to pass a board examination or certification examination, which I passed in 1975.  And that's kind of the process to go through.

Q.   Do you have certifications in any other fields of medicine?

A.   Well, addiction medicine is -- when I became certified with the American Society of Addiction Medicine, that was the only certification for people in addiction medicine at that time.  And so that's my certification for addiction medicine.

Q.   Have you, during the course of your career, treated addicted smokers?

A.   I have.

Q.   And have you treated them for nicotine addiction?

A.   I have.

Q.   Have you treated some 52,000 addicted smokers

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=8
1429

during your career?

A.   Well, I haven't personally done that.  So maybe back up.  When I was a primary care physician, I treated people with all kinds of addictions and all kinds of medical conditions.  So that was -- but I began working in the tobacco area in the middle 1970s, and then went on to help develop the Nicotine Dependence Center.  And the Nicotine Dependence Center at Mayo Clinic Rochester is --

Q.   Wait.  Did you bring some slides with you today that concern the Mayo Clinic and the Nicotine Dependence Center?

A.   I did.

Q.   Okay.  Before we get to that, I would like a follow-up question, which is, during the course of your career, have you treated addicted smokers for lung cancer?

A.   I have.

Q.   Have you treated addicted smokers for COPD?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And have you treated smokers who wanted to quit their nicotine addiction?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, before you go any farther, could we put up the slides that you brought with you

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=9
1430

concerning the Mayo Clinic?  Tell the jury, please, a little bit about the history of the Mayo Clinic.

A.   Well, this slide shows the two founders of Mayo Clinic, Dr. Will and Dr. Charley, who were the two brothers that founded the clinic in the late part of the 19th century.  It became an integrated group practice in 1917, when they basically gave their fortune to establish the Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation for Education and Research.

Q.   Can I stop you for a second?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   Where is the physical headquarters of the Mayo Clinic?

A.   It's -- the original was in Rochester, Minnesota.

Q.   Okay.  Please continue.

A.   So they gave their fortune to establish the Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation for Education and Research, and they did several things that were important.  One is they gave a lot of the money to establish this, but then they also mandated that everyone go on salary that was going to work at the Mayo Clinic.  So that was a tradition that started almost a hundred years ago.

So what this slide says, it's an integrated

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=10
1431

group practice of medicine.  So it's integration of all different specialties.

But the real key to it is up in the corner where the Mayo signature is.

The big shield in the middle represents patient care, patient services.  The other two shields are research and education.  So it's the integration of those three things -- practice, education and research -- that really has been the main motivating factor for people to stay there and people to come.

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.  Show the next slide, please, Dan. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Could you explain this to the jury? A.   So the primary value of Mayo Clinic, and this permeates the place, is the needs of the patient come first.  That's why the middle shield is representing patient services, and the other two shields are smaller and represents education and research, because the focus is on the patient.  The needs of the patient come first.

Q.   Okay.  What was the -- what is the mission at the Mayo Clinic?

Next slide, please. A.   Well, it's to provide hope, health, and

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=11
1432

well-being every day through this integrated clinical practice, education and research.  So it's really --that's the primary value, is the patient comes first, but it's the integration of the three things --practice, education and research -- that makes the --makes the place really special.

MR. WICHMANN:  Show the next slide, please. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Who are those three fellows?

A.   So in the middle is Dr. William Worrall Mayo, who was the father of two sons.  And the two sons are Dr. Charley and Dr. Will Mayo, who became world-renowned surgeons, and they are the ones that really founded the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota

Q.   From a historical perspective, did the Civil War have anything to do with the organization, the founding of the Mayo Clinic?

A.   It did.

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.

Relevance.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

A.   So William Worrall Mayo was a physician.  He came from England, and he settled in Indiana, got his medical degree, and then ended up in Minnesota in a little town west of Rochester.  And at the time of the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=12
1433

Civil War, Rochester became an examination station for the Union Army.  So Dr. Mayo move to Rochester to be an examining surgeon for the Union Army during the Civil War.  And that's why he stayed there and that's why the sons came back to practice with him.

MR. WICHMANN:  Could you go forward two

slides, please, Dan? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q. I think you pretty much summarized it, but there is a slide that talks about what the Mayo is. Would you please go through this with us?

A.   So we kind of talked about this.  It's all different specialties.  It's integrated, so there is no hesitation to ask for help from someone else.  So if I have a patient who has a condition that I've identified I need help from an expert, there is no hesitation to ask for assistance or consultation.  So integration means we're tightly integrated with the common medical records, so the medical record now is electronic, but back in the old days it was one record for each patient, which went to the hospitals -- or not to the hospitals, the outpatient.  So it's tightly integrated.

And then research and education are integral to this.  It's a part of the integration.  It's a nonprofit organization.  Any money that's made goes

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=13
1434

back into education or research and into the facilities.

It always has been physician directed.  So the CEO of Mayo Clinic has always -- always has been and always will be a physician.

And I already mentioned this, that the physicians are salaried.  So there is no benefit for me, as an internist or a surgeon, to do more things or less things for the patient.  We really want to focus on what is in the best interests of the patient and provide that patient with the best quality of care we can and not do more or less than we have to.

And the team focus is really critical too, because we frequently have patients that are complicated, and we need help from other people that work together as a team.

MR. WICHMANN:  All right.  The next slide, please, Dan. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   You told us the Mayo Clinic is headquartered in Rochester.  Are there any other Mayo Clinic locations in the country?

A.   Well, the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville started, I think, almost 30 years ago now, and it's grown over the years.  And then a year so or so after

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=14
1435

that the Arizona campus started in Scottsdale and now has a campus in Phoenix as well.  But still, the mother ship is going to be the Rochester campus, because it's been there for a hundred years, and it's hard to build something that big in a relatively short period of time.

But these three sites are tightly integrated with a common theme, a common value that -- so if you go to Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville or in Phoenix, you have the same feel for the needs of the patient come first, irrespective of where you might be seen as a patient.

Q.   Okay.  When did you retire from the Mayo Clinic?

A.   In July 2014, July 3rd.

Q.   Do you still -- do you presently hold positions there?

A.   Well, I'm working with a group we started, which is called Global Bridges, which is an international effort to train physicians and other healthcare professionals on how to treat the tobacco dependence.  I'm still working with that executive team.  And that's my main connection with Mayo Clinic in Rochester.

Q.   Are you still -- were you ever a professor of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=15
1436

medicine at the Mayo Clinic?

A.   I was.

Q.   Tell the jury a little bit about that, please.

A.   Well, there are different levels of academic achievement, beginning with instructor, assistant professor, associate professor and full professor.  And so it really -- to become a full professor, you have to have had major contributions in education or research or both.  And I had the good fortune of being able to do both.

Q.   When you retired from the Mayo Clinic, from the mother ship, in 2014, what was your position?

A.   I was the director of the Nicotine Dependence Center and professor of medicine --

Q.   Okay.

A.   -- in the department of medicine.

Q.   Would you tell the jury about the Nicotine Dependence Center?  What was it?  What is it?  When was it started?  Who founded it?  That sort of thing.

A.   Well, the Smokers' Clinic was the only thing available to people who needed help stopping smoking back in the 1970s.  And I went through that Smokers' Clinic in 1975, and then came back, because I'd had addiction training in my fellowship and in internal

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=16
1437

medicine.

Q.   Could I stop you there?  When you say you went through the Smokers' Clinic, please explain.

A.   Well, I was a smoker.  I started smoking after I stopped playing basketball in college, and I was a heavy smoker from the very beginning, and I ended up finally stopping smoking for good by going to the Smokers' Clinic, which was an outpatient, one session a week for eight consecutive weeks, two hours each session.  And so I stopped smoking on November 22nd, 1975, and went back as a counselor, basically, to help run the groups, because I'd had addictions training in my fellowship, and then went on to become the director of the Smokers' Clinic.  And then in the mid 1980s, we were able to do all kinds of things at Mayo Clinic.  We could do transplants, we could do surgery, but we didn't have any clinical services to treat patients with tobacco dependence.  So one day I got two phone calls in the same half day of patients who were in the hospital who had serious vascular problems who were still smoking.

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.

Hearsay.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

A.   And so the answer was -- from the physician

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=17
1438

was, what do we have to offer these patients to help them stop smoking?  And the answer was, we don't have anything.

So we got a group of people together to help determine and develop a clinical service.  And then in April of 1988, we started up the Mayo Clinic Nicotine Dependence Center to begin to provide treatment services for patients that we were seeing in the hospital, or outpatients who had tobacco dependence, and treated them for that. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  Well, would you explain to the jury in simple terms what the difference was between the outpatient Smokers' Clinic that you worked at, and where you were actually a patient at, and the Nicotine Dependence Center?

A.   Well, the Smokers' Clinic only ran three times a year, because it was eight weeks long, and so if you didn't happen to be there at the right time, you could not get any type of treatment.  And that's really pretty much what was available in a few places around the country at that time.

So the Nicotine Dependence Center service that we developed was based on the addictions model that I learned from my -- during in my fellowship where

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=18
1439

the services were provided by a counselor under the supervision of a physician.  So that's the model we used to develop the Nicotine Dependence Center.  So we had counselors who now are called tobacco treatment specialists who provide most of the services under the supervision of a physician.  And we have outpatient counseling, we have bedside counseling in the hospital, and we have a residential treatment program for people with severe tobacco dependence who come in to an eight-day residential treatment program, just like they would if they would come in for alcohol or opiate or cocaine dependence.

Q.   Okay.  Tell us a little bit about the residential treatment program.  When was that founded?

A.   Well, it was -- the idea was there in 1988, when we first started, but we didn't get approval to do that until we did some research to show that we could actually provide the services and people would come and we would have good outcomes.  We did that, and in 1991 and 1992, we started the residential treatment program, which is eight days long.  The patients are admitted on a Friday and dismissed on the following Friday.  They get group therapy.  They have education.  We tailor make the pharmacotherapy, so we'll use more than one nicotine patch frequently; we'll combine patches with

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=19
1440

other short-acting nicotine replacement products; we combine the combination of pharmacotherapy to help with withdrawal symptoms and help people to stop smoking.

So it's very intense.  They have a lot of sessions, individual sessions as well as group sessions.  And we get a chance to see those patients every day or make rounds on the patients like you would in a residential treatment program or in a hospital service.  So the physician is involved, but the counselors are still the ones providing the main level of service with the counseling that they provide.

Q. So this is -- these are people that check themselves into the hospital for help to deal with their nicotine addiction?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Do you have a number through 2014, when you retired, as to how many patients that your staff at the center's treatment program treated?

A.   Well, overall, it's around 53,000 patients from April of '88 through April of 2014.  And about 1600 of those went through the residential treatment program.

Q.   And what was your position at the residential treatment program when you retired?

A.   I was the director of the Nicotine Dependence

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=20
1441

Center until January of 2014, when I made the transition to Dr. Hays, who is now the medical director of the Nicotine Dependence Center.

Q.   Well, at the time that you created or you helped to create the residential treatment program, were there other residential treatment programs, that is, inpatient hospital treatment programs for addicted smokers in the country?

A.   There was one.  It's in St. Helena, California.  There is one, and it's still in existence today.

Q.   How many are there today?

A.   Two.

Q.   Two.  During -- and how long were you the director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the Mayo Clinic?

A.   From April of 1988 through January of 2014.

Q.   During that time, did you have any occasion to treat any employees or executives of Brown & Williamson --

MR. HARRISON:  Objection. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   -- for nicotine addiction?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, relevance, Your

Honor.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=21
1442

(At the bench.)

THE COURT:  What's the relevance of that?

MR. WICHMANN:  Well, Your Honor, I'm not going to get into the individual treatment, but they are going to pooh-pooh him and his work and everything that he does at the Mayo Clinic and nicotine addiction, and I think that the jury ought to know that it's a serious addiction, and he has actually had some of their top executives come for treatment from his program.  And if he answers the question yes or no, then I'm not going to ask any more questions.

It also goes to his -- it also, Your Honor, goes to his credibility and veracity as a witness, that if Reynolds and Brown & Williamson people went to him for help with addiction to their own product, I mean, that tells the jury that the man is a credible witness and was a credible doctor.

THE COURT:  All right.  At this point, I'm going to sustain.  If for whatever reason somehow the defense opens the door, we can revisit it. But right now I will sustain.

MR. HARRISON:  Thank you, Your Honor.

1443

Q.   Okay.  Dr. Hurt, getting back to the residential treatment program at the Mayo Clinic, did you have an education program while you were the director that dealt with smoking and health?

A.   Correct.  In fact, we started the program with the patient services first, because we knew that if we established it on a patient base, that we would likely be able to succeed and be there, you know, 25, 30 years later.

But we also wanted to have the other two parts of the Mayo signature to be operational.  So we started the clinical program in April of 1988.  We just had our first research project in September of 1988, a nicotine patch study, and we had our first learner in November of 1988.  So we began laying the foundation for a fully integrated practice, education, research program.  So we have a full education program, we have a full research program that goes in to complement what we do in the patient care arena.

Q. Have you conducted research and published articles through your research program at the Mayo Clinic?

A.   I have.

Q.   Can you give the jury an idea of approximately how many articles, book chapters,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=23
1444

editoria
	Ls, and so on, concerning smoking and health

that you
	've published, researched on?

A.
	I really don't know, but it's over a 175,

probably
	close to 200, when you count all of those

things.
	

Q.
	Okay.  Have you studied the issue of why

people smoke?
	
A.
	To a certain degree, yes.

Q.
	Have you published on that issue?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Have you studied adult smokers and adolescent

smokers?
	

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Have you published on that subject?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Okay.  Have you studied nicotine dependence

and addiction and how to treat tobacco dependence?
	
A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Have you published on that subject?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Have you done research on that subject?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	How about on nicotine replacement therapies?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Would you tell the jury in simple terms what

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=24
1445

that means?

A.   Well, the first medications we had to treat tobacco dependence or nicotine addiction -- we use those terms interchangeably -- was nicotine gum, which came out in the 1980s.  And the idea was to give the smoker a replacement of nicotine.  And that's why it's called nicotine replacement therapy.

And then in 1991 and 1992, the nicotine patches came out, which was kind of the second group of nicotine replacement products.  And then in addition to that, there is nicotine lozenges, a nicotine inhaler and a nicotine nasal spray.  So there's five nicotine products that fall under the rubric of nicotine replacement therapy.

What we found out very early on was that none of them was as efficient of delivering nicotine as the cigarette.  And so some of the early research we did showing nicotine patch therapy was way -- using the single-dose nicotine patch was way less than what most of the patients needed to get adequate replacement.  So we did patch studies where we used two patches at a time.

And just to give you an example, the most I've used in a single individual patient was three 21 milligram patches, plus a 14 milligram patch, plus

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=25
1446

nicotine lozenges, plus nicotine nasal spray, plus bupropion, which is called Wellbutrin.  So we used all the different medications together to match up with whatever the level of dependence is.

Q.   Okay.  We're going to get to that in a second.

Would you tell the jury in simple terms why you were studying and publishing on nicotine replacement therapies?  Why is it that -- what was the benefit of those?  What is the benefit of those?

A.   Well, first of all, the nicotine replacement therapy can help relieve withdrawal symptoms that people have -- irritability, anxiety, frustration, anger, loss of concentration.  Those are kind of the classic withdrawal symptoms.  So the nicotine replacement therapy can help reduce that.  It doesn't relieve them.

And also, we know that in the randomized clinical trials where we compared nicotine patch therapy to placebo, that by using patch therapy, you could double the chances of the person stopping smoking compared to placebos.

So we found out through our research that there was efficacy of using those medications to help people stop smoking.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=26
1447

Q.   So that's what they're for, to help people stop smoking?

A.   Correct.  They help relieve withdrawal symptoms and also help people stop smoking.

Q.   And we're going to get to this in greater detail a little bit later.  But what is it that kills smokers, the nicotine or the smoke from the cigarette?

A.   Well, cigarette smoke contains over 7,000 chemicals, over 60 known carcinogens.  And nicotine is not one of those.  It's not a carcinogen.

So the nicotine drives the addiction to continue to use the product, which in this case would be cigarettes, and it's all the other things, all the other chemicals in cigarettes that do the damage. Specifically, the carcinogens cause cancer, some of the other chemicals cause heart disease, and some of the chemicals cause COPD.  And there is a whole myriad of tobacco-caused diseases that related to the other chemicals in the tobacco smoke, aside from nicotine.

Q.   So my question to you is, for an addicted smoker, do you give them nicotine through another source in order to help them to quit smoking, another source other than cigarettes?

A.   Correct.  And so the idea is to help them get through the withdraw symptoms and then to use the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=27
1448

nicotine replacement products or the other medications for as long as it takes them to get comfortable in their absence from smoking.  So when asked the question, How long do I need to use this medication?, the answer is, As long as it takes.

Q.   Doctor, we're going to get to the previously secret tobacco industry documents a little bit later in your testimony today.  But have you performed research on those documents and have you published articles on those documents?

A.   I have.

Q.   Now, what is -- has the research that you have performed that you have just told the jury about and the articles that you have published been peer reviewed?

A.   Well, the peer-reviewed articles go on to journals, and the non-peer-reviewed articles would be like book chapters and editorials.  Sometimes they are not peer-reviewed.  So the peer-reviewed articles are the ones that go into, like, the New England Journal of Medicine or the Journal of the American Medical Association.  So they're kind of separate in my CV.

Q.   Doctor, have you been a presenter to other professionals on any subjects concerning nicotine addiction and health?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=28
1449

A.   I have.

Q.   Where?

A.   All over --

Q.   Just give us --

A.   -- in the United States and internationally as well.

Q.   What is the U.S. Surgeon General?

A.   Well, the U.S. Surgeon General is a presidential appointee who basically helps to shape the public policy or health in the United States.  And various ones have had better results with that than others.  It really depends on the personality of the individual and how they can -- how they can work within the government.

Q.   Does the U.S. Surgeon General's office issue reports?

A.   It does.

Q.   Have you been a contributor to any of those reports?

A.   One of the major ones that I was a contributor to was one on alcohol.  And that was back -- I can't remember what the date was, but we wrote a chapter on alcohol and nutrition, because in the first part of my career, I worked in the addictions unit as a medical consultant, so we did a lot of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=29
1450

research on addictions other than tobacco -- alcohol, opiates and other addictions.  So alcohol and nutrition was one the chapters that I contributed to in a Surgeon General's report back -- I don't know, it must have been in the 1980s somewhere.

Q.   Doctor, I would like to ask you a few questions about nicotine.

MR. WICHMANN:  Dan, would you put up the

slide, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Would you tell us, before we get to the slide, in your opinion, is the nicotine -- is nicotine addictive?

A.   It is.

Q.   Okay.  Would you tell the jury what it is? And let's go through the slide.

A.   Okay.  So I have already mentioned it's not a carcinogen.  It's a liquid in its native state.  So when you have tobacco leaves, when you look into the leaf and for the nicotine, it's a liquid.  And so when you burn it, it is distilled.  And what that means is it becomes -- when you burn it, it becomes a vapor, and than as it travels down the rod of the cigarette or pipe or cigar, it cools and become a liquid again.  And then it coats the tar particles, which are part of the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=30
1451

incineration of the burning of the tobacco.  And so the tar particles can carry the liquid nicotine into the system.  But then there is also this, we call it a gas phase.  And that means that some of the vapor stays vaporized.  It doesn't become liquid.  So it gets pulled into the stream of smoke.  So the stream of smoke has both liquid nicotine and vapor or gas phase nicotine that goes into the cloud of smoke into the lungs.

It is only the free nicotine that crosses biological membranes.  Nicotine is present in three forms:  Bound, partially bound and free.  And that, whether or not it's free depends on -- how much is free depends upon what the pH of the medium is.  The higher pH the more free nicotine there is.

So when we use nicotine gum in patients, we tell them, if you're going to put nicotine gum in your mouth where the absorption of nicotine takes place, through the lining of the mouth, don't put anything in your mouth that's going to lower the pH, because that will bind the nicotine.  So don't put coffee in there, don't put tomato juice or orange juice, because those are acidic and they will bind the nicotine and make it so it doesn't absorb.

So inhalation, though, is the most efficient

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=31
1452

way of getting nicotine into the system.

Q.   Okay.  In simple terms, would you explain what you mean by that?

A.   Well, when you inhale the tobacco smoke, the nicotine goes into the lungs, which is a very large surface area, and it's very rapidly absorbed.  And it doesn't take but just a few heartbeats to go from the tip of your finger to the brain.  And the speed of delivery of any drug helps determine its addictive potential.

Q.   What are nicotinic receptors, Doctor?

MR. WICHMANN:  We have a slide on that, Dan. THE WITNESS:  So the receptors in the brain are present in all of us.  And the normal neurotransmitter is called acetylcholine.  And so acetylcholine is a chemical present in all of us that can activate these receptors, and when they activate these receptors, they cause the release of another neurotransmitter called dopamine, which is a pleasure sort of neuroreceptor, or neurotransmitter.

So when you're doing something that is fun, if you're watching a funny movie or eating a piece chocolate or having sex or anything that has a pleasure to it, then acetylcholine is released and

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=32
1453

activates these receptors.

So these receptors are present in all of us. Well, nicotine chemically is similar to the

structure of acetylcholine.  So over the last

hundred years or so, these now are call the

nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, because both

nicotine and acetylcholine can activate them. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   So everybody had -- every human has these in their brains?

A.   That's correct.  Other places too, but the brain is the focus here.

And so when you smoke cigarettes, you get very high concentrations of nicotine going to the brain, activating these receptors.  And then what happens over time is they become upregulated.

Q.   What does that mean in simple terms?

A.   It means that there are more of them, there are physically more of them.  So --

Q.   So the more you smoke, the more receptors your brain develops?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Okay.

A.   That's correct.  And so not only do you have more of these receptors, which are relying upon

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=33
1454

repeated doses of nicotine to remain comfortable, so some people smoke for the pleasure, some people smoke to avoid withdrawal, most people smoke for both reasons.

The nicotine also resets the sensitivity of these brain reward systems -- they are the systems that produce the pleasure -- and makes it so that they are very sensitive to these high concentrations of nicotine delivered by cigarette smoking.

The other thing is that there is an indelible memory left in this reward system.

Q.   Where is the memory?

A.   It's in the receptors.  And we don't understand it completely, but what we know is that the receptors will downregulate after a person stops smoking so that the number goes down to the number you started out with as a normal person.  But this memory doesn't forget what that reward sensation was like, so --

Q.   Does that have anything to do with craving and anything to do with wanting to smoke?

A.   It does.  And so this memory is evoked by external cues or triggers.  So when we talk to patients, we say, Well, tell me about the situations where you would have the urge to smoke?  And they will

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=34
1455

tell you, Well, I was talking on the telephone or having a cup of coffee or whatever those situations were.  Those external cues cause this memory to become activated, and that produces what we call craving. So withdrawal symptoms are related to the level of nicotine in the blood and in the system, and they go away within the first two weeks.  So irritability, anxiety, frustration, anger --

Q.   Right.  That was --

A.   -- loss of concentration go away within just a few weeks.

Q.   Let me ask you the question this way.  For the nonsmokers amongst us, would you explain to them in simple terms what you mean by cravings?

A.   Well, craving is the, basically, urge to smoke.  People call it craving; people call it urge to smoke.  So when a person has stopped smoking, or even if they haven't stopped smoking, if they're in a situation where the situation in front of them would be a time they would usually smoke, driving in the car, talking on the telephone, that can invoke the urge to smoke.  And these cravings can be very intense, but they're very short; they last for just a couple of minutes.

And so in the treatment process, we educate

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=35
1456

the patients about what are you going to do when you have these urges to smoke?  What are you going to do to either avoid the situation or get through the situation without smoking?  Because they're not going to last very long, and if you get through that, you will get through it until another one comes up.

Q.   Okay.  Now, is all this that you have just described to us -- what causes all of this to happen in the human brain?

A.   It's the nicotine delivered by -- in high concentration by tobacco products.

Q.   Let me stop you right there, please, Doctor. Did you bring a slide -- did you bring a video with you today, an animation, if you will, that talks about the neurobiology of nicotine addiction?

A.   I did.

Q.   Could you go to --

MR. SMITH:  He's going to narrate. MR. WICHMANN:  Yes, yes. MR. SMITH:  Okay. (Whereupon, a video clip was played in open

court.)

A.   So this video was produced to help our patients understand this.

So this shows carbon monoxide and nicotine

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=36
1457

coming off the tip of the cigarette.  It goes into the mouth and into the lungs, where it's very rapidly absorbed, to the left side of the heart, and then it goes out of the aorta and straight to the brain.  In the brain, there are receptors where nicotine fits into them, causing the release of various neurotransmitters, in this case, Dopamine.  Dopamine causes the pleasurable response.  And then with repeated exposures, there is more receptors that occur.  So that's the upregulation part of it.  So the receptors --

And if you don't feed them nicotine, then they develop withdrawal symptoms -- irritability, anxiety, frustration and so on.

So that's basically, in a nutshell, the process of what happens when you smoke a cigarette.

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.  Would you go back one slide, please, Dan? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Would you -- does this demonstrative help you to sum up what you've just explained to the jury?

A.   This is -- this is a -- basically a still cartoon from the patient education material we use in counseling.

So smoke goes into the lungs, rapidly

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=37
1458

absorbed, left side of the heart, out of the aorta, and

the first big arteries take it straight to the brain.

It takes five heartbeats to go from the tip of your

finger to the brain.  So the cigarette is the most

efficient drug delivery device that's ever been

invented.

BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Stop right there, Doctor.

Is what you've just gone over for us with this jury theory or is it proven science?

A.   This is the science.

Q.   Okay.  Now, Doctor, have you also studied human brains through MRI imaging?

A.   We have.  Not "we" have, but there have been studies in the literature.

Q.   Okay.  Are you familiar with the literature insofar as brain changes in the addicted smokers?

A.   Correct.

MR. WICHMANN:  Do we have a slide that goes

to that, Dan?  I think it's right there. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   So what does this slide depict, Doctor?

A.   So this is a study where they did autopsies and did brain sections of people who had died.  So these aren't brain biopsies from live people, these are

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=38
1459

autopsy studies.

And the sections of the brain are stained for the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.  And the stain makes those receptors darker.  So on the top is a nonsmoker.  This is normal.  And on the bottom is the smoker.  And the smoker has -- literally has billions more of these receptors than the nonsmoker does. That's why this is so difficult for some people to stop smoking.

Q.   And what causes the billions more receptors in the smoker's brain?

A.   This is the upregulation process we talked about.  So those high concentrations of nicotine, the spike of nicotine that occurs, causes the receptors to upregulate.  Physically, there are more of them that the smoker has to contend with.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you show the next slide,

please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   What does that show, Doctor?

A.   Well, this is a PET MRI study.

Q.   Stop right there.

Please tell the jury in simple terms what an MRI study is.

A.   Well, it's kind of like a CAT scan.  MRI is

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=39
1460

just a magnetic resonance imaging study.  So it's a kind of a step beyond CT scans.

And so this shows on the top, the brain of the control -- the control brain.  In other words, there is no smoking with any of the ones on the top. So this is the control.  This is what normal looks like.

This is no puffs of a cigarette, this is one puff of a cigarette, this is three puffs of a cigarette, this is one whole cigarette, and this is three whole cigarettes.

And the blue means that these receptors we talked about are now saturated.  And so it takes only one to three cigarettes to basically saturate the entire system.  That's why I just said that the -- that the cigarette is a very efficient drug delivery device.

Q.   Are these MRI images adult, fully-formed brains?

A.   They are.

Q.   Is there science on how nicotine affects an adolescent brain, if at all?

A.   Well, there is less there than there is with adults, because it's harder to study adolescents.  But we know the brain development of adolescents is -- it takes a lot longer than most people think in order for

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=40
1461

the brain to fully mature.

Q.   Well, what effect, if any, does smoking have on an adolescent brain?

A.   Basically, the same effect as it does on the adults.  It causes the receptors to respond, releasing Dopamine and other neurotransmitters.  But it also causes upregulation of the receptors over a period of time.  We don't know exactly how long it takes for the upregulation to occur, but it's probably months or even longer, but certainly months.

Q.   What effect, if any, does smoking have on an adolescent brain insofar as addiction and ability to quit is concerned?

A.   Well, what we know about this is that the earlier a person starts smoking, the more difficult --the more difficulty they have stopping smoking and the level of dependence is higher.  Also, the earlier they start smoking, the more likely they are to develop diseases associated with smoking.

Q.   Does nicotine have any effect on the executive functions of an adolescent brain?

A.   The what functions?

Q.   The executive, the ability to choose, decide in the future.

A.   No.  Again, the adolescent brain is not fully

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=41
1462

developed, and so the adolescent brain is missing a very important part of the development, which is the front part of the brain.  And that's where judgment is. And so when the teenager starts smoking, they don't have all of the equipment in their brain that the adult has .

Q.   Okay.  And what effect, if any, does nicotine have on that, on the front part of the brain?

A.   Well, it probably doesn't have a direct effect on the front part of the brain, but it's just the relationship between adolescent smoking and where they are in the development of their brain.  Most teenagers, when -- who are smoking, when you ask them the question, Do you plan to be a smoker when you're 21?, most of them say, No, I'm just going to do this with my friends for a couple years, and then I'll be through with this.  And they don't realize they can become hooked fairly quickly.

Q.   Have you studied this phenomenon or this science?

A.   Well, we have nicotine patch studies in adolescents.  And they are a -- they are a tough group.

Q.   Okay.  Tough group in what sense?

A.   A tough group to help them stop smoking and helping them come back for their appointments.  They

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=42
1463

are just a -- they're a -- well, they're on the fringe

of adolescence, so they have a different mindset and

they are difficult and they are difficult to help stop

smoking.

Q.   Doctor, I want you to assume that in opening

statement, the lawyer for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

said --

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Rephrase.

BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, have over 60 million

smokers --

Are you familiar with the static that over 60

million smokers have quit smoking in this country? MR. WICHMANN:  Can I have the next slide, please.

THE WITNESS:  Well, that's a commonly stated number.  But you have to put the qualification in, that it is live people, because there are more ex-smokers in the country now than there are current smokers.  So from 1964 to 2014, a large number of people stopped smoking.  But those things don't count the 25 million smokers who died of tobacco-caused diseases, because all of them stopped smoking too.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=43
1464

So when you see these numbers being thrown around, sometimes they are -- they are underestimating the effect of all this.

And then also, when you do those big population studies, to be counted as a smoker, you have to have had smoking of a hundred cigarettes in your lifetime.  And then later on, the same question is asked of that person who said that they were a smoker, "I smoked a hundred cigarettes in my lifetime."  "Are you currently smoking every day or most days?"  And if the answer is no, then that person is counted as an ex-smoker.  So it doesn't take into account, you know, how much they were smoking.  It doesn't take into account their medical conditions.

So this slide kind of summarizes all of that in that there are a large number of smokers currently, the vast majority want to stop, large numbers try to stop every single year, and of those, only a very small percentage are able to stop smoking.

So were this simply a matter of choice where these 31 million people who want to stop smoking, they said that they want to stop smoking, if only half of them stop smoking every single year, this

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=44
1465

probably would have gone away a long time ago,

because the numbers -- the mathematics would say

within five cycles, the number of smokers would be

reduced dramatically.

So this isn't just a matter of choice.  This

is a matter of an addicted brain for the smokers

we're talking about. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, let me ask you this.  Is a person who smoked a hundred cigarettes in their lifetime an addicted smoker?

A.   Probably not.  But that's the problem with these big population surveys, because you don't ever really know what they did beyond that.

And so the second question is, you're counted as a smoker because you did that, and then are you smoking some cigarettes every day or most days.  And if you answer that question no, you're counted as an ex-smoker.  So we don't -- we never know what the denominator really is.

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, are you ready to shift gears now and talk about definitions of addiction?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, what -- would you tell the jury, what is addiction?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=45
1466

MR. WICHMANN:  We have a slide, Dan.

THE WITNESS:  Well, these are two definitions

that are commonly used.  And as of the Surgeon

General's reports have said, there is not one that

everyone can agree to.

But from the National Institute of Drug

Abuse, which is the -- like the National Cancer

Institute, they define this as a chronic relapsing

brain disease characterized by compulsive drug

seeking and use despite harmful consequences. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Can I stop you there?

A.   Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively).

Q.   Chronic relapsing brain disease.  Is that what you've described with your slides here today?

A.   Correct.  And so other addictions, too, affect the neurotransmitters in the brain.  There are receptors that are affected by alcohol, by opiates and other drugs.  And so it's a central nervous system problem; it's a brain problem.  It's not a problem of willpower, if you will.  It's really much deeper than that, and much more severe than that.

Q.   What do you tell your patients about --addicted smokers about willpower?

A.   We tell them that they need to have some of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=46
1467

that, but we also need to educate them about some of the slides that I just showed you, which are this is more than willpower; this is a brain problem.

And when you explain this to them, it helps relieve some their guilt, because they have struggled with this, and to help them understand that this is something that they really have had -- they didn't know at the time that they started smoking and didn't know that their brain was going to change.  And so there is great relief for them, because most smokers have a lot of guilt because they're continuing to smoke.

So explaining this in those terms helps them. We tell them they have to have motivation, they have to be persistent, they have to change their environments, change their behavior.  We're going to help them with medications.  We do all of those things together.

So there is not one single thing that helps a person to stop smoking, with the possible exception of a severe medical problem that can occur.  Say, a heart attack.  And we know that people who survive heart attacks who are smokers, a very large percentage have been able to stop smoking just because of a severe, catastrophic medical event.

Q.   Getting back to the definition, characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use.  In the context of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=47
1468

nicotine addiction, would you please explain what that means to the jury?

A.   Well, "compulsive" means that the control isn't there.  "Compulsive drug seeking" means that you make sure you have your drug supply; you make sure you don't run out of anything; make sure that you can find places that you can smoke and use the drug.  So that's what the drug seeking sort of behavior is.  That's kind of the general term that's used for describing all addictions, and alcohol being one and making sure that you have a supply of alcohol.  And that drug seeking behavior is that becomes the focus, on making sure that you have that.

Q.   And "despite harmful consequences," what does that mean, Doctor?

A.   Well, harmful consequences in the general sense of addiction can mean a wide variety of things. It can mean being arrested for intoxication.  Can be arrested for selling drugs and can be -- have those kind of consequences.  Or it can have health consequences.  And so people who use intravenous drugs can develop HIV/AIDS or hepatitis.  And so those are some of the harmful consequences for the general drug. People who are alcoholic can develop liver cancer.

Q.   Concerning nicotine addiction, because, after

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=48
1469

all, cigarettes are a legal product, would you please tell the jury how, despite harmful consequences, it would apply to, if at all, the definition of nicotine addiction?

A.   Well, for the harmful consequences of people who are smokers and are dependent on the nicotine from cigarettes are many medical consequences.

Thirty percent of all cancers -- 30 percent of all cancers in this country are caused by tobacco. And that's a number that hasn't changed very much.

Over a half million smokers die every year in this country of tobacco-caused diseases.  That's a very large number.

So the health consequences of cigarette smoking are the main harmful consequences.  In fact, that's one of the criteria we use.  A person who continues to use, despite having a serious medical problem, would be considered to be highly dependent all by itself.  You wouldn't have to have anything else from a medical context to really say that this person had a high level of dependence.

Q.   Okay.

A.   So those medical consequences, when they become known to the individual patient and they continue to use or continue to smoke in this situation,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=49
1470

would put them at a high level of dependence.

Q.   What is the definition that's underneath the NIDA definition?

A.   Well, this is one we came up with several years ago to try to help -- help people who were coming to Mayo Clinic to understand what we're talking about. So we used both terms.  Nicotine dependence is also called tobacco dependence.  And in today's terms, tobacco dependence is one we use more than nicotine addiction.  It's addiction to tobacco products caused by the drug nicotine.  And it means if you can't stop using.

Q.   Can you --

A.   Nicotine dependence means you can't stop using the substance even though it's causing you harm. Again, this is in a medical context.  When we defined this, we wanted to have people to understand who were coming to a medical institution how we focus this.

So this is just our definition for use in our clinical setting.

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.  Could you go to the

next slide, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, in your clinical practice as a nicotine addiction specialist, is there a criteria that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=50
1471

you use to determine whether or not somebody is addicted to nicotine?  And let me make sure we have the right slide.

MR. WICHMANN:  This would be on the Heaviness

of Smoking Index slide, Dan. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Here we go.

A.   So this is the Heaviness of Smoking Index. In our clinic practice, we actually use what's called the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence, of which two of the questions are the ones here.  But that requires a person to answer questions or fill out a questionnaire.  So that's a six-item test that we use in our clinical practice.

And the two questions that give the Fagerstrom test most of its validity is these two:  How soon after you wake up do you smoke your first cigarette?  And the second one, How much do you smoke?

It's called the Heaviness of Smoking Index. As you can see, there are different ratings.  So if you smoke one in five minutes, it's a three.  If you're smoking half a pack or more -- more than half a pay a day, you get a three.  And so high dependence would be people with a five or six.

Q.   Let me stop you right there, Doctor.  It

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=51
1472

looks like, "Scoring, zero to 2, low dependence."  Does that mean that somebody that's never smoked a cigarette would qualify as being somehow dependent on nicotine under this Heaviness of Smoking Index?

A.   Not if they have never smoked.  And so what we commonly say is that most people who are daily smokers would have some level of dependence.  There are people who we call chippers who -- that actually -- the word comes from the heroin literature, who are infrequent, irregular users of the drug.  And so they would probably not fall within this -- this category. But people who are daily smokers would have some level of dependence.

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, is the Heaviness of Smoking Index an objective and scientifically proven method?

A.   Yes.  I mentioned the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence is what we use clinically, because we can actually ask the patient questions.  We teach that.  But we also teach this.  So for clinicians who have busy practices if they wanted to have the two questions that would be valid, that would be objective, and reliable and predictive, "objective" meaning you can actually have people observe these two factors, valid --

Q.   And so -- Factor No. 1 -- I didn't mean to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=52
1473

interrupt, but I would like to ask you this question: What is the significance of measuring the time that the patient smokes their first cigarette in the morning?

A.   Well, nicotine has a very short half life. It only has a half life of 120 minutes.  That means that it disappears from the circulation fairly quickly. So if you had a nicotine level of 20, two hours later, it would be ten; two hours later it would be five; two hours later it would be two and a half.

So overnight, the nicotine levels in the blood go down.  So the first thing in the morning, these receptors are saying, I need to have a cigarette, because the nicotine level is way down, or low or maybe nonexistent.  So the first to first cigarette really measures that level of dependence that's -- that is caused by the receptors saying, I need a hit of nicotine, and I want it right now.  So the sooner they have the first cigarette after they get up shows that the receptors are really struggling with the fact they haven't had a cigarette overnight.

Q.   What is the second criteria there, Doctor?

A.   So the second criteria is how many -- how many cigarettes per day do you smoke?  And that gets back to what I mentioned earlier.  Daily smokers would -- almost all would have some level of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=53
1474

dependence.  So how much you smoke in a day is -- is representative of what level of tolerance that you have.

So tolerance is, in the general sense in drug addiction, means that you need more of the drug in order to produce the same effect.  So -- so for people who are tobacco dependent, if they are smoking 30 or 40 cigarettes a day, they have a higher level of tolerance than people who are smoking less.

And so we usually just ask patients -- you remember the first cigarette that you had.  And most say, Yeah, I remember that, because I got nauseated, got light-headed; I wanted to throw up.  How did you get over that?  You smoke some more cigarettes, and that's -- you build up the tolerance.  So people who are smoking 31 or a pack and a half to two packs a day are -- have exhibited high levels of tolerance.

Q.   Doctor, I noticed -- I noted that the ability to quit smoking is not on this index.

A.   Correct.

Q.   Is that a criteria to whether or not someone is medically, scientifically considered to be or assessed to be addicted to nicotine and in cigarettes?

A.   No.

Q.   Can addicted cigarettes smokers quit?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=54
1475

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  Are they still considered addicted after they have quit?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  Why is that?

A.   Because those receptors in the brain have this -- what's called the indelible memory that they --the receptors don't forget what the reward was like, and so they are -- there is going to be stressful situations and cues to smoke, that are going to provoke the urge to smoke.  So I'm not sure that indelible memory ever cases away, even though I stopped smoking in 1975 and I wouldn't -- I wouldn't think about having a cigarette today.

Q.   Doctor, have you reviewed any material concerning the smoker in this case, Terry Rounds?

A.   I have.

Q.   Could you just generally give the jury an idea of what you have reviewed?

A. Well, in general, he's pretty much typical of patients that we have seen over the years. He started smoking at a very young age.

Q.   Before we get to the particulars, what I meant was, Did you review medical records?

A.   I did.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=55
1476

Q.
	Did you review depositions?

A.
	I did.

Q.
	Okay.  Did you review any other material?

A.
	Depositions and medical records.  I think

that's i
	t.

Q.
	And you reviewed a job evaluation?

A.
	There was one of those, yes.

Q.
	Okay.  Let me just ask you, before we get

into the
	case-specific issues, were you practicing

addiction medicine in the '80s?
	
A.
	Yes.

Q.
	And were you practicing addiction medicine in

the '90s
	9

A.
	In the '70s, '80s, '90s, and the 2000s.

Q.
	I would like to ask you about the tools that

were available to you prior to, say, 1991 or 1992.  Was
	
the nico
	tine patch available to you to give to your

patients
	in the '80s?

A.
	No.

Q.
	Okay.  Was it available to give to your

patients
	-- do you know offhand when it first got on --

came on
	the market?

A.
	It first came on the market in December of

1991, bu
	t it really didn't hit the market until early

1992.
	

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=56
1477

Q
	Okay.  So the smoker in
	this case,
	would he

have had any of the tools available to him t
			o quit

while
	he was alive that are, say,
	available
	to addicted

smokers that come to your clinic
		today?
	

A
	They are.  Nicotine gum
	and nicotine patches
	
were available.  The gum came out
		in the ear
	My 1980s

and the patches came out in 1991,
		'92.
	

Q
	Okay.  So before '91, '92, patches
		were not

available for Terry Rounds?
		
	

A
	That's correct.
	
	

Q
	Is Chantix a commonly used medicine
		in

addiction in nicotine cessation t
		oday?
	

A
	Yes.
	
	

Q
	When did Chantix come on
	the market
	9

A
	2006.
	
	

Q
	So that wasn't available
	to �
	

A
	No.
	
	

Q
	-- Mr. Rounds?
	
	

A
	No.
	
	

Q
	Are there any other drug
	s that are
	widely

available today as a result of research in nicotine
			
addict
	:ion that were not available
	to Mr. Rounds while
	
he was
	3 alive?
	
	

A
	Well, bupropion came out
	as a drug
	to help

people
	3 stop smoking -- it's also
	called Zyban -- in
	
Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=57
1478

1998.  And so those -- so we have two non-nicotine drugs.  Bupropion and varenicline, which is also called Chantix, and then the five nicotine products that we talked about earlier.  So when he was alive, he had two -- two things he could have used, gum and patches.

Q. Okay. Have you reviewed the transcripts? Do you see any evidence that he used either of the two of those?

A.   He did.

Q.   And in your opinion, was Mr. Rounds addicted to the nicotine in cigarettes?

A.   He was.

Q. Did the fact that he was able to quit at some point in time before he died of cancer, does that have any effect in your assessment of whether or not he was addicted?

A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, let's go through some of the criteria -- or some of the facts that you found in this case that go to your opinion.

MR. WICHMANN:  Do you have a slide on that,

the next slide?

MR. SMITH:  Which one?  Criteria? MR. WICHMANN:  I'm sorry, yeah. BY MR. WICHMANN:

1479

Q.   Maybe you can just summarize for the jury.

MR. WICHMANN:  No, no, not that. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Tell the jury what you what you -- what was important to you about Terry Rounds in your assessment

A.   Well, first of all, he began smoking at an early age.  I think his sister -- younger sister said --

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor, hearsay.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, may I -- we approach?

THE COURT:  Come on up. (At the bench)

MR. WICHMANN:  I don't know how a sworn deposition testimony of Nancy Guenther, his sister, can be considered hearsay, Judge, so that's the source of his information, and I will get it from him right now.

THE COURT:  Well, it is hearsay.  The question is, Is she going to be testifying?

MR. WICHMANN:  She's going to testify by deposition, Judge, sworn testimony.

THE COURT:  What I will do is I will instruct the jurors if that -- if they are not to -- they

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=59
1480

are not -- that any testimony about what other people have said or hearsay is not being offered for the proof of the matter asserted in regard to Dr. Hurt's testimony.

MR. WICHMANN:  Fine.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. WICHMANN:  Fine.

MR. HARRISON:  Your Honor, I think it would be -- I think for Nancy, all he has to say, if he rephrased the question, is, Did Nancy see him smoking?  That cures the hearsay problem.

THE COURT:  It's still hearsay, because the only reason he knows Nancy saw it is because of the deposition.

(In open court)

THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, when Dr. Hurt testifies about what other people might have said, sometimes we call that hearsay.  For purposes of Dr. Hurt's testimony and his opinions, any hearsay or any statements that he's read, depositions, those types of things, do not -- they are not being offered in Dr. Hurt's testimony for the truth of the matter in those statements. Okay?  All right? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=60
1481

Q.   Dr. Hurt, did you review the deposition of Nancy Guenther, Terry Rounds' sister?

A.   Sister, yes.

Q.   And what did she say?

A.   Well, I think she was the one that said the top part, which was he started smoking at age 15, which is fairly typical.  And he was a daily smoker by age 17.  And I think she testified that he was smoking all the time by the time he got to age 17.

Q.   Okay.  Did you review any medical records that had to do with how much Terry Rounds smoked during his lifetime?

A.   Well, the bottom ones have to do with the medical records.  One recording was a

one-and-a-half-pack-a-day smoker for 35 years.  Another is a 80- to 90-pack-year history.  What a pack year is, is one pack of cigarettes a day for a year.  So when we take histories from the medical records, they are not always as good as people who are directly observing a person's smoking behavior.  Sometimes there tends to be some variation, so that's not totally unexpected.  But I would go back up to the people around him that saw him every day.  And most of the people testified that he smoked a pack and a half to two packs a day for his entire smoking history.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=61
1482

Q.   Okay.  Now, the patient chart also has an indication that the patient was a pack-and-a-half-per-day smoker for 35 years.

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Leading, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Don't lead. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  Have you seen a medical record from the hospital that says that he was a less than 80- to 90-pack-year-history smoker?

A.   That's correct.  That's kind of what I just said.  There is inconsistency in the medical records, so sometimes the best observation is someone that lives with the -- with the patient.

Q.   In your experience as an expert in nicotine addiction, have -- is it common for addicted smokers to underreport how much they smoke?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor, calls

for speculation.

THE COURT:  Lay a foundation first. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, have you studied the reporting of addicted smokers in terms of their smoking history to clinicians?

A.   We have.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=62
1483

Q.   Have you had experience in the over 53,000 smokers -- or 52,000 that you and your clinic have treated, to consider whether or not they were always a hundred percent accurate in their assessment?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Argumentative,

Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, we have.  And probably the

best way is to do an objective measure --BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Right.

A.   -- is measure blood levels of either nicotine or cotinine to kind of corroborate what their self-report is, and so we have done studies alike that.

Q. In addition to doing studies in your clinical practice, is it important for you to know and to study this issue?

A.   It is, because we try to match up the treatment with their smoking rate or their blood levels of the amount of nicotine that they're usually getting from smoking cigarettes.  So it's a very important very of question.  So we press the patients, when we seem them in our clinic, to verify as best we can how much they smoke and even get a significant other, a spouse or partner, to help with that assessment, so we can

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=63
1484

better match up the treatment options with their level of tobacco use.

Q.   Okay.  So if you were treating Terry Rounds for his addiction, would it concern you that one record says one and a half packs per day for 35 years and the other indicates a 80- to 90-pack-year history?  Would that discrepancy concern you?

A.   No.  That's fairly common.  I mean, that's a fairly common discrepancy in records.  It depends on who the person was taking the history, how much they probed, how much other questions they asked, whether they were just filling out a questionnaire.  There all kinds of variation in the way medical records for this issue are taken.  In fact, we did a study a couple three, maybe four years ago now, to see how many different ways at Mayo Clinic Rochester that smoking was assessed, with what questions were asked.  And there was 114 different questions, so we tried to narrow it down to one or two.

Q.   Okay.  Have you reviewed Terry Rounds' discharge summary from October 24th, 1996, from the Halifax Hospital?

A.   I have.

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.  Dan, could you put that

up?  That was -- all right.

BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Tell the jury what the significance of this medical record is.

A.   Well, this list, the different of the diagnoses that are part of the dismissal summary -- and one of them was tobacco abuse.  And our experience has been that this doesn't often make the final diagnostic sheet.  So whoever wrote this dismissal summary, I think, was very tuned in to the problem.

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.

Speculation.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  So even in our place, if the

person is not seen in the Nicotine Dependence

Center, they often can be a long-time, heavy

tobacco user and not have tobacco abuse or tobacco

dependence as part of the diagnostic dismissal

summary or the final diagnosis. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  In your mind, does tobacco abuse mean tobacco addiction in this record?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.  Calls

for speculation.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=65
1486

Q.   Doctor, as a clinician and an expert in nicotine addiction and treatment, if you received these medical records with this diagnosis in October of 1996, what would that tell you about the addiction or about the condition of the patient insofar as whether or not he was addicted?

A.   Well, I think what I said was that this --whoever the physician was that made this diagnosis was pretty astute.  And tobacco abuse and dependence can be synonymous, given his history of how much he used over what period of time would mean that this was an addicted smoker.

Q.   In your mind, is there any doubt that Terry Rounds was an addicted smoker?

A.   Not at all.

Q.   Does this reflect the diagnosis of the physicians who were treating Terry Rounds here in Dayton Beach at the Halifax Hospital in October of 1996?

A.   It did.

Q.   Doctor, getting back to the previous slide, did you review any depositions that would tell you how -- how Terry Rounds purchased his cigarettes?

A.   By the carton.

Q.   By the carton.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=66
1487

Okay.  Does that have any input or final assessment in this case?

A.   It does.  It fits in with the overall picture of making sure that the supply that he had was always intact.  But going back to the two criteria we used, how much did you smoke and time of first cigarette, those are the things that are -- that are the criteria that are valid reproducible, and predictive.  So if you have a high Heaviness of Smoking Index, you're much less likely to stop smoking.  So from a treater standpoint, when we have those two questions answered with a three each, then we are much more aggressive in the treatment for that patient.

Q. Okay. Were you able to learn whether there was any evidence as to how soon Terry smoked when he got up in the morning?

A.   Well, there were various reports of this. But as soon as he got up, he grabbed his pack of cigarettes and went to what they call the Florida room, which was outside, the screened-in porch, and would have his first cigarettes out there.  So it was within five minutes of rising.

Q.   Did you find any evidence as to whether or not he was a chain smoker?

A.   Yes.  In fact, at least one person -- I think

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=67
1488

it was Mrs. Rounds -- defined pretty clearly what a chain smoker is.  Chain smoker is a person that smokes a cigarette and lights the next cigarette off of the one he just finished.  And so he was a chain smoker, which isn't one of the criteria for tobacco dependence but shows that he needed to have nicotine fairly constantly.

Q. Can an addicted person smoke -- be a chain smoker at some times and then at other times of the week when they're working, for example, not be?

A.   Sure.  So a lot of this has to do with their environment, wherever they are.  So the person's ability of not smoking in those situations is -- it's fairly -- that's fairly common.  That's the way most smokers are.

Q. Did you find any evidence as to whether or not Terry Rounds smoked at night?

A.   He did.

Q.   What's the significance of that?

A.   And that's one of the criteria that we know. So if you have your first cigarette within five minutes of rising, remember, during the night your level of nicotine goes down, so if those receptors at two o'clock in the morning say, I need a hit of nicotine, and you get up and go and have a cigarette,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=68
1489

then that's one of those criteria that we in the addictions world look upon as an indication of severity dependence.  It's not part of the Heaviness of Smoking Index, but there are a lot of people that think that it should be, because it also is predictive of whether or not a person is able to stop smoking.

Q.   In your experience, Can addicted smokers attend church without smoking, for example?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Yeah.  And how do they usually do that?

A.   Well, they usually smoke a cigarette or two right before they go in, and then as soon as they walk out the door, they -- they light up again.  And sometimes it can have observed symptoms of withdrawal. In fact, there's reports of Mr. Rounds having nervousness and some agitation during church, even though he didn't go up and go out to smoke.  So their levels go down, and they can exhibit symptoms of withdrawal.

Q. Did you find any other evidence in your review of the case material as to whether or not Mr. Rounds experienced withdrawal when he wasn't smoking?

A.   Well, there were several people that reported this.  And I can't remember exactly which one, but they

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=69
1490

talked about two things, one when he wasn't smoking, wasn't able to smoke, or was trying to stop smoking. He had different efforts to stop smoking.  He would say, I'm going to only smoke six cigarettes today, and then he would end up smoking a pack and a half or two packs, because he would get irritable and have anxiety.

And the other part is that when he would have those symptoms, if he smoked a cigarette, they would go away.  It would be calm.  And so it's kind of what I mentioned earlier.  Some people smoke for the pleasure; some people smoke to avoid withdraw; most smokers smoke for both reasons.  And I think he was one of those. MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.  Your Honor, may I approach for one second? THE COURT:  You may. (At the bench)

MR. WICHMANN:  I still have 15, 20 minutes on this topic, but I was thinking this might be a good time to take a quick short break.

THE COURT:  All right.  We'll take a midmorning break.

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Anybody need to take anything up before we take a recess?

MR. WICHMANN:  Just briefly.  We have some previously agreed-to hospital and medical records, the death certificate.  I think it might be a good time for us to introduce that into evidence as --they are under --

THE COURT:  I want you to -- any time you have those and you have it agreed, I want you to move it in in front of the jurors.

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.

THE COURT:  You can -- madam clerk can have it premarked and everything, but I want you to actually move it in in front of the jurors.

MR. WICHMANN:  Is that how you would like me

to do every exhibit?

THE COURT:  Yeah.  I want them to see what's getting moved into evidence.

MR. WICHMANN:  All right.  Thanks.  We'll put that together and take care of it for the clerk.

THE COURT:  All right.  We're in recess.

(A recess was taken at 10:34 a.m.)

(Court called to order at 10:50 a.m.)

THE COURT:  All right.  Please be seated.

Dr. Hurt, you can come on up and sit down.

(The witness returned to the stand.)

MR. WICHMANN:  As you can see, Your Honor, I moved so I could get the exhibits to bring up.

THE COURT:  That's fine.  All right.  You can bring them in if they are all here.

THE BAILIFF:  Yes, sir.

(The jury returned to the courtroom at 10:49 a.m.)

THE COURT:  All right.  Everybody can be seated.

Whenever you are ready.

MR. WICHMANN:  Thank you, Your Honor. BY MR. WICHMANN:

to move around.

MR. WICHMANN:  Dan, would you put back up the slide that we had? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, calling your attention to the case-specific evidence that we have been going over, there is on this slide, Continue to smoke despite medical reasons, COPD, not to smoke.

Did you find any evidence of that in your review of the hospital records?

A.   Correct, both from the hospital records but also Dr. Shelton's letter to the patient.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, at this time the plaintiff would offer into evidence Halifax medical records and Terry Rounds' death certificate.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. HARRISON:  Subject to review, Your Honor, no objection.

THE COURT:  All right.  We'll accept that as Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 and 2 respectively, and they are a composite.

MR. WICHMANN:  Thank you, Your Honor. (Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 and 2 admitted.) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=73
1494

Q.   What evidence did you find of that in your review of the hospital records?

A.   Well, I think probably one of the most compelling things was what Dr. Shelton wrote in a letter and he observed him to still being smoking when he saw him at the hospital.  And his COPD was getting worse.

Q.   Okay.  Let me stop you there, Doctor.  Let me put this up on the screen.

This is one of the documents that we've just admitted into evidence. Would you tell the jury what is significant about that?

A.   Well, just what it said.  As you know, your COPD is worsening as you continue to smoke.  And then he offers him help, which I think is also a pretty enlightened physician.  He offers him help saying, I want to help you with stopping smoking.  This will require for you to come in for an intensive period of one to two times, weekly office visits, to help with behavioral modifications.

Q.   What is behavior modification?

A.   Well, as I mentioned earlier, we talk to the patients about changing their behavior in order to get around situations where they normally would smoke.  So we talk to the patients about where you smoke, how much

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=74
1495

you smoke, and what are the conditions that you smoke, and you need to change your behavior to avoid those situations or to have a plan for what am I going to do when I am in that situation and knowing I'm going to have the urge to smoke.  So changing behavior is part of the treatment process that counseling gets at.

Q.   There's that other highlighted portion in this medical record.  Is that at all significant to you?  Are able to avoid hospitalization?

A.   Well, what we know is that -- that people with COPD are on a -- have a -- usually have a much higher level of addiction than people that have other medical conditions.  COPD is one of the hardest treatment of people that we see with tobacco dependence.

Q.   Treatment for what?

A.   For their tobacco dependence.

Q.   Why is that?

A.   Well, we don't really know for sure, except that people that have a heart attack may have had no symptoms of that up until the time that they have a heart attack.  People with COPD have symptoms of shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and such, for a long time.  And so we think that being able to continue to smoke despite having those symptoms they

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=75
1496

know are related to smoking puts them in a higher level of addiction.

Q.   Would you tell the jury, please, what COPD is?

A.   COPD is -- the other name for it is emphysema.  COPD stands for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  It's where the small air sacs in the lungs rupture because of the closure or the spasm of the bronchial tubes causing the pressure to build up and causing rupture of the air sacs.  And so when you look at a person with COPD lungs, they have -- their air sacs are disfigured and basically destroyed.  We do -- also, we do pulmonary function tests to determine how much air a person can blow out after doing a standard test.  That is the way we kind of diagnose that.

Q.   What is the cause of COPD?

A.   The major cause is cigarette smoking.

Q.   Do you have an opinion after having reviewed the hospital records in Terry Round's case as to whether his COPD was caused by his smoking addiction? MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor,

relevance.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  It clearly is.  So people can

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=76
1497

develop COPD from other things.  But, you know, in a situation where you don't have asthma and you don't have other exposures like he did, then his cigarette smoking caused his COPD.  But the cause of his cigarette smoking was his addiction to the nicotine.  No one has become a cigarette smoker smoking cigarettes that do not contain nicotine. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, I'm going to ask you during the course of today several questions concerning Terry's COPD and his lung cancer and his death.  The jury is going to hear from Dr. Cromartie, his treating doctor, later.  So I would like just for you to focus your responses on addiction and addiction and Terry's lung cancer and Terry's COPD.  Okay? A.   Okay.

Q.   Okay.  Now, Doctor, have you reviewed this follow-up letter from Dr. Shelton to Mr. Rounds?

A.   Well, again, this -- I think this doctor was really quite good.  He says --

Q.   It's hard to read the date, but it looks like it's September.

A.   September of the same year that he saw him --

Q.   1992?

A.   -- '92.  So he's saying here that he's missed

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=77
1498

a couple of appointments on September the 9th and September whatever it is.  "I hope you are still not smoking."  And he's saying, We need to get you back in to see me again so we can help you regardless.  And so what we know about this is that, in our clinic, anyway, when people stop attending sessions, follow-up sessions --

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor, calls

for speculation as to Mr. Rounds.

MR. WICHMANN:  Let me rephrase the question. THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Is relapse in addicted smokers, does relapse happen to addicted smokers who are in treatment?

A.   Relapse is the rule rather than the exception.  Even in our place, when they come in to get counseling and see a counselor, only about 27 percent of the people are able to stop smoking and remain abstinent for a year, so relapse is the rule rather than the exception.  If they come into our residential treatment program, they have much better outcomes. Fifty-two percent are able to stop smoking, but that's with very high levels of intense treatment.  So this is a fairly common scenario which would be a relapse situation for a person that fails to show up.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=78
1499

MR. HARRISON:  Again, Your Honor, objection,

speculation as to Mr. Rounds. THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Does relapse have anything to do with an addicted smoker's motivation to quit?

A.   No.

Q.   Could you explain to the jury, In terms of addiction medicine, does motivation play a part in quitting?

A.   It does.  So we do questions about that.  We call it motivational interviewing.  So we want to find out where the patient is and to join the patient wherever they are.  So we ask them questions about, How confident are you that you will be able to stop smoking and your desire to stop smoking?  So there are questions that we ask that have to do with motivation. But motivation is only part of the equation.  So what we do is we meet the patient where the patient is and try to move them forward to being able to stop smoking and then support them once they are able to do that. That's part of the behavioral counseling.

Q.   Does this tell you as an expert anything about whether or not Terry was serious about quitting smoking?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=79
1500

A.   Oh, I think he was serious.  He went to see him -- he went to see the doctor before.  He sees --obviously, he's had some appointments, and he is going to miss some, so this is just one of the many efforts that he made to stop smoking over his lifetime. MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor, speculation.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Now, Dr. Hurt, have you also in this case reviewed a performance evaluation from Terry Rounds from the Halifax Hospital? A.   I have.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you put back up the other slide?  First page.

Your Honor, at this time the plaintiff would offer into evidence the Halifax medical record performance evaluation for Terry Rounds for 7/26/86 through 7/29/86.

MR. HARRISON:  No objection.

THE COURT:  All right.  That will be accepted as Plaintiff's Exhibit 3.

MR. WICHMANN:  Thank you, Your Honor. (Plaintiff's Exhibit 3 admitted.) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=80
1501

Q.   Okay.  Dr. Hurt, have you reviewed this document before coming down here today?

A.   I did.

Q.   And what does document this show?

A.   Well, this is a formal performance appraisal of Mr. Rounds by the supervising -- the supervisors here, Thomas -- I can't make out this name.  So he's the chief pharmacist and did the evaluation in 1986.

Q.   Have you supervised medical and nonmedical personnel during the course of your career?

A.   I have.

Q. Have you done performance evaluations or performance appraisals for medical and nonmedical personnel in your career?

A.   I have.  All the way from -- I was a division chair, so I oversaw a division of internal medicine, so other physicians, nurses, clinical assistants, secretaries.  And then at the Nicotine Dependence Center, same thing.  We did performance appraisals on physicians, counselors, secretaries, and other people, so that's something I have done all my life.

Q.   Are they important to an employee's career?

A. Oh, absolutely. So the way this usually works is that --

Q.   I'd like to ask you in a hospital setting,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=81
1502

for example at the Mayo Clinic, how does the procedure

work for performance evaluations?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, relevance, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  So as a supervisor, or a person overseeing a unit, the first thing we do if we have a performance problem is to sit down with the employee and talk about it.  And then if there's continued performance problems, we talk about it again.  And then -- if it continues, then what I usually would say is, Here is the problem, and you've got X number of weeks to fix this problem, whatever it is.  And if we're not making that progress, then I'm going to write it up and put it in your record as a formal performance appraisal. So, usually, before you get to the step of having something like this, you've had conversations with the individual before that.  That's just kind of a common practice.

BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   What performance evaluation was Mr. Rounds

given?

A.   Well, the top part of it is you want to

get -- he wants to get to be a thousand up here.  So

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=82
1503

these are the weights for the different factors.  And the one he falls down on is here.  Before he gets a 7 and falls down to a 6 on this one.  But the thing that they focus on, Terry must stop taking cigarette breaks at frequent intervals.  And that's -- that's what they -- they've made in the performance appraisal, which would go into his personnel file, which would be very upsetting to most -- to most people.

Q.   What is the significance of this performance evaluation in your assessment as to whether or not Terry was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?

A.   Well, this is continuing to use despite having the serious job-related problem.  So it would be -- it would be a serious issue and would speak to the fact that he was unable to do this after having had conversations along the way with his supervisors to the point of having to have it written up formally.

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, speculation as to

what Mr. Rounds did or did not do with his

supervisor.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, I think we've covered everything down to multiple quit attempts.  And let me ask you, In your review of the material that was provided to you for

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=83
1504

Terry Rounds, did you find any evidence that Terry tried to quit?

A.   He tried to quit on multiple different occasions with a variety of different ways.  This instance with the job performance appraisal, he tried to quit cold turkey after that, which means --

Q.   What does "cold turkey" mean?

A.   Which means he tried to gut it out, if you will, and stop all on his own without any help or assistance with either behavorial counseling or from medications.  That would have been a time when he only would have had access to nicotine gum just because of the date.  So that's what cold turkey is.  It comes from the heroin literature, actually, but that's a different issue.  That's where the term comes from.

Q.   Did you see any evidence that he tried the nicotine gum to quit?

A.   He did.  And he also tried walking.  He tried hypnosis.  He tried multiple different things over a period of time.  He tried reduction.  He would get up in the morning and say, I'm not going to smoke as much today as I did yesterday, but then smoking it all over again.  I'm going to smoke only six cigarettes in this period of time, but ended up smoking.  So he did all of the things that, I think, a person would have thought

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=84
1505

about at that time without having had any formal treatment.

Q.   You mentioned hypnosis.  Did you see evidence as to whether or not he tried hypnosis?

A.   He did -- according to the depositions, he did try hypnosis on one occasion.  And it didn't -- it didn't, apparently, work.  What we tell people is that if a person uses hypnosis and they are able to stop smoking, I'm happy with that.  As long as it's legal, I don't care how a person stops smoking, as long as they are able to do that.

From the literature we know that there's no scientific evidence that hypnosis works to help people stop smoking, but it doesn't mean people shouldn't try that if they think that that might help them.

Acupuncture is another one but there's no science behind it helping people to stop smoking.  But if a person thinks that's going to help them, then I'm not going to criticize them.  I'm going to tell them we know that behavorial counseling works and pharmacotherapy works, and that's what we would recommend, but we'll help you with whatever you want to do to try to stop smoking.

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, I think we've covered the others on this particular slide.  All the way to the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=85
1506

bottom, 320 doses of nicotine to the brain each day, does that sound like a lot?

A.   Well, that's -- that's one of the things that sets cigarette smoking aside from other addictive drugs.  So if a person is smoking 30 to 40 cigarettes a day, which is what Mr. Rounds was, then each cigarette basically has six or seven doses, six or seven puffs, if you will, and so the number of doses that they have every day is really more than people who use other drugs.  And that's a very significant factor in why this is so difficult.

Q.   Going back to the Heaviness of Smoking Index, if this patient had come to you at the Mayo Clinic, how would you have scored him?

A.   He would have been a 6.

Q.   Okay.  Could you walk the jury through that very briefly?

A.   Okay.  So the score is over here.  So if he's smoking within five minutes of awakening, he gets a score of 3.  If he is smoking a pack and a half to two packs a day, he'd get a three.  So that would be a total score of six, which would put him in the high dependence category, which in our clinic would mean that he would be getting more aggressive treatment. For example, we would use more than one nicotine patch

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=86
1507

at a time.  And maybe patches in combination with short-acting NRT, or patches in combination with bupropion or varenicline.

So we gauge the severity of their dependence and then match up the treatment with whatever we get from the Fagerstrom, or from the Heaviness of Smoking Index.

Q.   In your opinion, based on reasonable scientific and medical probability in this case, was Terry Rounds addicted to the nicotine in cigarette smoke?

A.   He was.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you put up the brands

history, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, just briefly, could you look over this slide?  Have you reviewed the literature -- or, I'm sorry, the case-specific material to see what brands of cigarettes were Terry Rounds' main brand?  By that, I mean the brand that he smoked according to the witnesses for most of his life?

A. Well, early on, it was unfiltered cigarettes, which would be over here. But then the ones that were most consistently talked about in the depositions from the various people were Winston, regular full-flavored

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=87
1508

Winstons, Winston Lights, low tar Winstons, and Vantage.  Those are the three that seemed to be the most commonly cited as from -- but there were other times he would use some here or there.  But those are the ones -- the brands that are most cited.

Q.   Okay.  What company manufactures the brands that, based on your review, Terry Rounds smoked the most in his lifetime?

A.   R.J. Reynolds.

Q.   Now, did you read the deposition of Arthur Normand, one of Terry's stepson?

A.   I did.

Q.   Did you read the deposition of Carolyn DeLucia, Terry's co-worker?

A.   I did.

Q.   And did you see -- were you able to determine whether or not Terry smoked other brands during his lifetime?

A.   Well, there was mention -- I think Ms. DeLucia mentioned that she thought he may have smoked Marlboros, but that wasn't mentioned by others. I can't remember what the son Arthur said.

Q.   Well, assume that he also mentioned that on occasion Terry would smoke Marlboro?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.

the objection, go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  Pardon me?

THE COURT:  He withdrew the objection.  Go

ahead.

THE WITNESS:  So, yes, that was another �

another -- the brand that was mentioned.  But,

again, the ones that are most consistent were

Winston, Winston Light and Vantage. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   All right.  Do you have an opinion based on reasonable medical and scientific probability as to whether Terry Rounds' addiction to the nicotine in R.J. Reynolds' cigarettes caused or contributed to his lung cancer and death?

A.   I do.

Q.   And we're going to get to the lung cancer and death records now.  Have you reviewed the hospital records that had to do with Terry's care and treatment?

A.   I have.

Q.   And have you in the past treated patients for nicotine addictions and for lung cancer?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And, again, I don't want to go into a lot of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=89
1510

detail on this in terms of the diagnosis of lung cancer, but -- because we're going to hear from Dr. Cromartie.  But could you put up the slide on -- yeah, all there.

Just generally speaking, Doctor, were there enough medical records in the hospital chart from Halifax that was available to you to -- for you to determine what Terry Rounds' cause of death was?

A.   There are.

Q.   Okay.  Could you just summarize for us what caused his death?

A.   Yes, he died from squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

Q.   Doctor, have you studied the relationship between addicted smoking -- addicted smokers and squamous cell lung cancer?

A.   Well, what we know about this is -- I think I mentioned it earlier -- the earlier a person starts smoking the more dependent they are, and also the more likely they are to develop cancers and other -- other diseases.  So he fits into that -- that category pretty -- pretty completely.

Q.   What is the relationship statistically between squamous cell lung cancer and cigarette smoking in this country?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=90
1511

A.   Well, there are basically four types of lunq cancer.  They are divided into two -- two broad cateqories, small cell cancer and nonsmall cell cancer. Nonsmall cell cancer includes squamous, adenocarcinoma, and larqe cell.  And the reason they are divided like that is because the treatments are different.  But for squamous sell carcinoma in particular, the relationship between ciqarette smokinq is the hiqhest.

Q.   Can you put a number on that?

A.   Over 90 percent would be related to ciqarette smokinq.

Q.   So in your opinion, Doctor, within a reasonable deqree of medical probability, did Terry Rounds' addiction to R.J. Reynolds ciqarettes cause or contribute to his squamous cell lunq cancer?

A.   Absolutely and unequivocally.  And the other thinq is we know that people who have COPD are much more likely to develop lunq cancer, as well.  So the two thinqs kind of qo hand in hand.

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor,

relevance.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, can you put up the death certificate, please?  Would you explain, Doctor, from an addiction

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=91
1512

medicine perspective how smoking addiction causes squamous cell lung cancer of the type that Terry suffered from?

A.   Well, the nicotine is the driving force behind this.  So as I mentioned earlier, if there was no nicotine in cigarettes, people would not become smokers, to begin with, as a teenager like he did, much less smoke over a long period of time like he did.  So the nicotine is the driving force, and the addiction causes the continued use of the substance.  And then the substance in this case, the 7,000 chemicals, the 60 known carcinogens, causes the lung cancer.

There's no real difference in alcohol. Alcohol is the addicting part of -- of -- of an alcoholic, but then the diseases like cirrhosis of the liver, is caused by the toxic effect of the alcohol and other chemicals.  So it's very similar to that.  But in this case in particular, in cigarette smokers and lung cancer, the two can't -- they are just on a continuum. They can't be separated out because nicotine drives the continued use, and the continued use causes diseases.

Q.   Doctor, let me show you this book here. You've seen this book before coming down today?

A.   I have.

Q.   Okay.  Let's just put this cover sheet up

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=92
1513

here so the jury can see it.  Tell the jury what this is.  I lost it.  There we go.

A.   This is the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders put out by the American Psychiatric Association.  And this is labeled DSM-5, which is the most current version of that.

Q.   Are you a psychiatrist, Doctor?

A.   I am not.

Q.   But do you have some familiarity with this book?

A.   I do.  We teach --

Q.   When you say "we," who does "we" mean?

A.   Well, people at the Nicotine Dependence Center, our physicians and other staff, we teach what's in that book as it relates to tobacco.  But we don't use it clinically because it doesn't have the validity and predictability that the Fagerstrom or the Heaviness of Smoking Index has.  So it's not something that we use clinically, but we teach our students and residents because they need to know that this is out there, and it's the criteria that other people use for other mental disorders.

Q.   Now, what did the DSM originate from?  Did it originate from nicotine addiction studies or not?

A.   No.  It's really about all mental disorders.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=93
1514

In fact, the earlier versions of it didn't have anything to do with tobacco or nicotine addiction.  It was only in later versions that -- that it was brought up or put into the criteria.  And then over the last 30 years or so, as the different versions have been revised, the section on tobacco dependence really didn't change at all until this version, they finally have included craving as one of the criteria.  But up until then, there was none of it.  So it came from the alcohol and opiate literature.  That's where the addiction sections of this came from.

Q.   Which are the nicotine-specific criteria?

A.   So there are --

Q.   That would be the Heaviness of Smoking Index, correct?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor,

leading. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Well, let me ask the question better.  Are there nicotine-specific measures?

A.   There are, but they do not include the Heaviness of Smoking Index, which is time to first cigarette and how much do you smoke, as the diagnostic criteria in this manual.  And that's one of the major problems with it, is because the Heaviness of Smoking

Index has been shown to be valid.  It's shown to be predictive.  In other words, the higher the level, the less ability to stop smoking.  It's reproducible.  It's objective.  And so a lot of the questions that come up from DSM-5 are much more subjective and require an interview with the patient in order to clarify what the answers are.

Q.   Well, how in the world could you do that since Terry Reynolds is dead?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, argumentative. THE COURT:  Rephrase. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Do you think that this is the appropriate measure to use in a case like this one?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.  Can we approach?

THE COURT:  Come on up. (At the bench.)

THE COURT:  I bet your psychiatrist is going to use that.

MR. HARRISON:  He is.  And here is the other concern at his first deposition, Dr. Hurt said he used the Heaviness of Smoking Index and the Fagerstrom.  Mr. Wichmann said Dr. Hurt didn't conduct a DSM-5 analysis.  But Dr. Hurt's

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=95
1516

deposition, because he did have a DSM opinion, he says there's enough information and actually filled out all of the criteria area.  And Mr. Wichmann is trying to impugn the DSM and say, Is this the appropriate case?  And I had to take a second deposition of Dr. Hurt specifically because he did a DSM analysis.  It's misleading and unfair at this point.

MR. WICHMANN:  No.  We're going to follow it up and he's going to go through the criteria. What happened was in his first deposition he said, I used the Heaviness of Smoking Index.  I did not use the DSM-5, but I could in this case.  Okay? Then I sent them a letter and said, So that there's no surprise, he's going to briefly run through the DSM-5 at trial.  So Mr. Harrison took about a three-hour deposition, asked all the questions, so my questions are going to be very brief to him on this.

THE COURT:  Don't state your questions like conclusions --

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.

THE COURT:  -- one.  And, two, you get to cross-examine him on that, so --

MR. WICHMANN:  Right, right.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=96
1517

THE COURT:  I guess I'll overrule, but you need to ask the questions in a different way. MR. WICHMANN:  Right, right.  I was just trying to move along for time, but I'll ask him more open-ended questions. THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. WICHMANN:  Thank you, Judge. MR. HARRISON:  Thank you, Your Honor. (In open court.) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Does the U.S. Public Health service have guidelines for treating tobacco use dependence?

A.   Correct.  It's called, Treating Tobacco Dependence, a Clinical Practice Guide. Q.   Does it mention the DSM? A.   No.

Q.   Have there been any new substantive additions to the DSM in the last several years?

A.   The only ones that have been added is, in this current version, craving was added, which was not there before.  So basically before that for 30 years the criteria had remained basically the same.

Q.   Have, to your knowledge, the criterion in the DSM-5 been tested clinically?

A.   Not to the same extent that the Heaviness of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=97
1518

Smoking Index has.  Again, the questions are -- are --you have to be able to, first of all, interview the patient, and then you have to be able to probe.  And there are 11 criteria that they use, so it makes it very cumbersome to use either in research or in a clinical setting.  And it hasn't had the same rigorous testing or clinical outcomes as the Heaviness of Smoking Index or the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence.

Q.   Are you familiar with the most commonly used criteria by addiction -- nicotine addiction medical doctors across the country?

A.   I am.

Q.   And what is that?

A.   Well, the one we use I mentioned before is the Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence, which is a six-item test that's been probably the most widely used questionnaire about tobacco dependence in the entire world, used more than any other single questionnaire. But when you cannot talk to the patient or the patient cannot fill out the questionnaire, those two items on that questionnaire give it its validity and predictability.  And one is how much do you smoke and time to first cigarette.  So that's -- that's the summary.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=98
1519

So if we have the ability to talk to the patient, then we use the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, which includes some other items beside those two.  But if we're unable to talk to the patient, those two things are objective, reliable, predictive, and have been validated.  And by validated, I mean in reproducible.  They ask those same questions over again to the same person over time, or the -- doing blood tests of the amount of nicotine in the blood of a person matches up with how high the index is.  So it's just -- it's just the best way to do it.

Q.   Would Terry Rounds have been assessed as addicted under Fagerstrom?

A.   He would.

Q.   Doctor, did I ask you, before coming down here today, to quickly go through the DSM-5 criteria even though you haven't had a chance to speak with Terry Rounds?

A.   Yes, we have done that.

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay, can we just put the

criteria up, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, I would just like you to give your assessment of whether or not Terry Rounds would have a tobacco use disorder under the DSM-5?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=99
1520

A.   Well, that's the other thing.  The DSM-5 now has changed.  All the substance use disorders now are called use disorders rather than dependence or addiction because the committee couldn't decide what to actually call it.  So in the previous edition they called it dependence, but now it becomes a use disorder whether it's cocaine or whether it's heroin or whether it's tobacco.

So these are the 11 criteria over here.  And so Mr. Rounds would qualify on the ones that are highlighted, so taken in larger amounts or over a longer period of time than was intended.  And the depositions talk about him wanting to not use and he ends up using the same way all over again.

So each one of these criteria we're able to probe.  You can find out more information.  Persistent desires, successive attempts to cut down or control tobacco use.  He did that lot of different times trying to quit smoking.  Great deal of time spent in activities necessary to obtain or use.  Well, he bought cigarettes by the carton, but he also smoked a lot.  So each cigarette was like six or seven minutes of a -- to smoke a cigarette times 40 cigarettes a day, would be a lot of time spent in using.

Recurrent drug use resulting in failure to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=100
1521

perform major role obligations at work, school, or home.  We know about the performance appraisal.  We also know that he said he told his -- one of the sons and his wife that he really felt badly about missing out on activities at home because he was always smoking.  So I could go through the rest of them, but suffice it to say that he would qualify under these criteria, as best we can tell.  It would be better if I could talk to him in person, because then I could explore with him what these other -- other issues might have been.

Q.   Well, let's just quickly go through the remainder.

A.   Okay.  So continued tobacco use despite having persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal problems.  His wife talked to him about the labels.  He was ashamed about --

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.  Calls

for speculation.  No foundation and hearsay. THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  So she talked with him about

this, and he -- he continued to smoke despite

having, not conflict, but at least having concern

expressed by his spouse.

Important social, occupational, or

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=101
1522

recreational activities are given up or reduced

because of tobacco use.  I have already mentioned

that he regretted he didn't spend as much time

doing family activities as he would like to

because of his smoking.

Tobacco use continued despite knowledge of

having persistent or physical or a psychological

problem that is likely to have been caused or

exacerbated by tobacco. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Would that be the COPD?

A.   That would be the COPD.  And what we know about this is, from a medical standpoint, not from a psychiatric standpoint, but from a medical standpoint when I see a patient who is continuing to use whatever drug we're talking about despite having a known medical problem with that use, then that puts that person at a very high level category for dependence.  That's just from a clinical standpoint.  That's not from a DSM category standpoint.

Q.   What is tolerance level?

A.   Pardon?

Q.   Tolerance?

A.   Tolerance I have already mentioned. Tolerance is defined by having to use more of the drug

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=102
1523

in order to get the same effect, and so he clearly had tolerance.  You can't smoke two packs a day unless your brain is tolerant to that.  Otherwise, you would have nausea, vomiting, lighted-headedness that would be continuous.  And then withdrawal symptoms, we don't have all the withdrawal symptoms that he might have had.  And this is where you would like to be able to ask him more about loss of concentration, change in appetite, and some of the other withdrawal symptoms.

We know he clearly had irritability.  He clearly had anxiousness and nervousness when he would stop smoking and cut down.  And that would be revealed if he would smoke again.  So that one would be one that we don't have all the information we'd have if we could talk to him.  So the whole point of this is to apply the DSM-5 criteria accurately.  You have to be able to talk to the patient.  And unless there's enough information in the depositions and other records to be able to do that, then you can't -- can't appropriately apply these criteria.

Furthermore, the validity, predictability, and -- and ability to get the right answers are not always here because, they are better done with, How much do you smoke?  and the time to first cigarette. Q.   With the shortcomings that you have told the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=103
1524

jury about, notwithstanding that, in your opinion, did Terry Rounds qualify under the DSM as having a tobacco use disorder?

A.   He does.  And the next page of this shows what the -- what the -- what the criteria -- I mean, he probably had cravings, but we just can't ask him the questions about it, so --

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.  Move to strike as speculative.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  So this is how they would put the severity.  Two to three symptoms would be mild.  Four to five would be moderate.  Six or more would be severe.  He would fall into the severe category under anybody's criteria, including these. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, I'm going to change gears and switch to another subject in a minute, but I just have a couple of more questions on addiction.  In the world of addiction, nicotine addiction, would you tell the jury what the concepts of rationalization and denial are?

A.   So rationalization is being able to continue to using despite having concerns, whether it be concerns about health effects or people talking to them

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=104
1525

about this, that, or the other.  They are concerned about health effects for this one in particular.  Being able to say "that will never happen to me," that would be rationalization.

Q.   Do you commonly see that in addicted smokers?

A.   Absolutely.  That was one of the things that was most revealing in the Smokers' Clinic back in the 1970s was, because I had training in addiction medicine as an internist, as a fellow.  Then when I became a counselor for the Smokers' Clinic, we would talk about rationalization and denial.  And the smokers understood exactly what that meant, as well as people who were alcohol or drug dependent.  So it's a common -- it's common across all addictions.

Q.   Did you see any evidence of rationalization on Terry Rounds' part in your review of the case-specific material in this case?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.  May we

approach?

THE COURT:  Come on up. (At the bench) MR. HARRISON:  Mr. Wichmann's questioning

specifically got started off with hearsay within

hearsay.  I understand that Your Honor instructed

the jury about Nancy Guenther will testify.  This

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=105
1526

is now Mrs. Rounds saying what Mr. Rounds believed or said he believed.  And that's the only thing these questions are meant to elicit.

I would object to have Dr. Hurt introducing the hearsay within the hearsay, particularly since we have objections to that coming into evidence at all.

THE COURT:  All right.  What's this now? Where is this going?

MR. WICHMANN:  I think he's going to tell the jury that Mr. Rounds did rationalize away his addiction.

THE COURT:  Where is it coming from?

MR. WICHMANN:  That's coming from -- what we would say would be hearsay exception testimony on state of mind from the family members' depositions.  And all the family members will testify in the case, Judge.  And we'll present the Alexander and Mrozek case that shows that that's an exception.

THE COURT:  All right.  Overruled.

(In open court.) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   What evidence did you find that Terry Rounds engaged in rationalization in your review of the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=106
1527

material?

A.   Well, continued to smoke despite knowing that he had COPD.  He rationalized the connection away, or he rationalized his continued use despite having a very strong medical complication that he was told related to his smoking.

Q.   Did he believe that he -- that his smoking was bad for him?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor. Leading, argumentative.

THE COURT:  All right.  Don't lead. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  Was there any evidence that went to his awareness or belief that smoking might be harmful to him?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Objection, Your Honor.  Pretrial ruling. (At the bench.)

THE COURT:  All right.  What's the pretrial ruling?

MR. HARRISON:  About Dr. Michel saying he couldn't talk about Mr. Rounds specifically as to awareness or beliefs.  And everybody at that time said that's a good standard, nobody should be talking about a specific awareness or belief he

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=107
1528

could have.

We're going to hear the evidence, the jury is going to decide, but he's not in a position to testify as to what Mr. Rounds did or did not actually believe or what he was aware of, which is the only place this is going.

MR. WICHMANN:  This goes to his addiction, Judge.  And that's a different issue totally. They raised it also in opening statement. Ms. Parker told the jury time and time again that he knew how dangerous cigarettes were, but he continued to smoke; it's all his fault.

That's what goes to the comparative fault in the case.  Who is more responsible?  Terry for believing the message of the industry and for saying the things that he said?, which Dr. Hurt is basically going to testify to, or the industry.

So it's an exception, and Your Honor can instruct -- you already instructed them on hearsay, but I think it would probably be -- and it comes in under Alexander and Mrozek also. State of mind.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

(In open court.)

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you back the last

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=108
1529

question, sir.

(A portion of the record was read by the

reporter.) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Yes.  That you could find?

A.   Correct.  And so he did some things that a lot of people who rationalize and deny do.  He said the filters on the cigarettes were taking all the bad stuff out.  He even dissected the filters for his wife, I think, or maybe one of the children and showed them the brown stuff in the filters, that this means that all the bad stuff is not there, so I'm not going to be harmed by this.

So he -- he said that to his spouse that he thought that the tobacco companies were really going to be able to make these things safer, and so that fed into his denial and rationalization, despite the fact that she talked to him about the warning labels and such, that he really believed that he -- that these were less harmful to him, so those were some of the examples that I can give you.

Q.   Thank you, Doctor.  Could we switch gears for a moment?

A.   Okay.

Q.   And I'd like to talk about the manufacturing

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=109
1530

of a modern cigarette.  Who is Dr. Channing Robertson?

A.   Say again.

Q.   Who is Dr. Channing Robertson?

A.   He's a chemical engineer from Stanford.

Q.   Do you know him?

A.   I do.

Q.   Have you worked with him?

A.   I have.

Q.   Now, just briefly, in what context did you work with him?

A.   Well, he was the second witness in the Minnesota tobacco trial.  I was the first witness.

Q. We're going to get to that in a moment, but did you bring with you here today a video concerning the manufacture of the modern cigarette?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Who -- who prepared -- who made that video?

A.   Well, it was prepared in the Minnesota tobacco trial, and Dr. Robertson was the one that toured the three companies, Brown & Williamson, Philip Morris, and Reynolds, to make the video.  And he was the one that put the video together to put into evidence in the Minnesota trial.

Q. Could you pull that microphone a little bit closer to you?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=110
1531

A.   I'm sorry. Q.   That's all right. A.   You were better off over there. Q.   No, I had it right.  It's a little bit awkward.

But you brought the video.  Could you play the video.  And I believe it's silent, correct?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.  Before we play the video, could we approach for a moment?

THE COURT:  Come on up. (At the bench.)

MR. HARRISON:  Your Honor, this is a trial exhibit prepared by somebody else.  To me, what Dr. Hurt said about this is the first time he's told that much detail.  He has no idea -- he's never testified as to who's testified, who created what part and what part of the facility this is from or that he himself made this video or toured it.  And that's why Mr. Wichmann was trying to lay the foundation.  It's been testified previously that this was made in a Philip Morris facility. There is Marlboro smoking.

MR. WICHMANN:  We can instruct him.  This doesn't have to do with Philip Morris or Marlboro. It's an instructional video that shows the jury

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=111
1532

how modern cigarettes are manufactured.  And he'll talk about that, because he studied it in his labs.  And he knows the gentleman that put this together.

THE COURT:  Hold on.  Is your objection more related to his explanation of the video or the video itself?

MR. HARRISON:  It's the video itself, and his attribution of it to Reynolds and Brown & Williamson.  This video, Dr. Cummings has said, who has testified about this video, said this video is from a Philip Morris facility.  The explanation now is it was at all three facilities. He didn't tour, he didn't -- it doesn't say which parts or from what facility.  It's clearly in Philip Morris.

I think the jury should be told this is in a Philip Morris facility, not Reynolds.

MR. WICHMANN:  That's fine.  It doesn't bother me if Your Honor chooses to instruct him. That's not the point.  The point is to show how modern cigarettes are manufactured.  So if you want to instruct him, I can just get the witness to say this is not a Reynolds facility, or he doesn't know if this is a Reynolds facility, and

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=112
1533

we'll take it from there.

THE COURT:  All right.  Well, you ask him that and make sure that gets cleared up first. MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.

THE COURT:  And if there's no issue, then that's fine.

MR. HARRISON:  Thank you, Your Honor. MR. WICHMANN:  Thanks, Judge. (In open court.) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Have you seen the video before today? A.   I have.

Q.   Do you know which manufacturer's facilities the video is from?

A.   Well, I mentioned he did three, three facilities.  I'm not sure exactly which one these are from.

Q.   Okay.  That's fine.  And all right.  So we just --

THE COURT:  Mr. Wichmann, go ahead and make the announcement.

MR. WICHMANN:  I beg your pardon, Judge? THE COURT:  Go ahead and make the announcement as to what facility this was on this video.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=113
1534

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.  We think it may be Philip Morris' facility, which is not the facility of Reynolds.  Okay?

THE WITNESS:  Okay.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you please � For the record, Judge, this is PT4581 A. THE COURT:  Okay. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   And as Mr. Smith's rolling it, could you please tell the jury what it shows?

A.   Before you start it, maybe I should explain just a little bit about the cigarette, because the people --

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.  The question is, Can you explain the video.

THE COURT:  It's nonresponsive. Mr. Wichmann, what do you want to do? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, have you studied the history of the modern American cigarette? A.   I have.

Q.   Have you studied the engineering insofar, as human smoking behavior is concerned, of the modern American cigarette? A.   Correct.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=114
1535

Q.   Have you studied how the modern American cigarette is designed in terms of nicotine and delivering nicotine to the human brain?

A.   I have.

Q.   Okay.  Based upon that, Doctor, would you tell us, in general terms, what this video is designed to show -- to show, and then we'll go through it?

A.   All right.  So the cigarette is made up of different types of tobacco.  So the American blend, which began in 1914, was the Camel cigarette, is made up of burley tobacco, flue cured tobacco and oriental or Turkish tobacco.  And those three different tobaccos have different levels of nicotine, they have different levels of pH, so they are blended together.

Q.   Let me stop you right there.  First of all, you have already told us what nicotine is.  Is nicotine in tobacco put there by mother nature?

A.   It is.

Q.   So are cigarettes just crumpled up natural products that are smoked?

A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  Do the cigarette companies, including R.J. Reynolds, have the capacity to manipulate the levels of nicotine in the modern cigarette?

A.   Absolutely.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=115
1536

Q.   Okay.  With that in mind, please continue your answer, sir.

A.   So those three types of tobacco were the original American blend.  And so blending them together can adjust the nicotine content and other things.

Q.   What is pH, by the way, in simple terms?

A.   pH is whether or not a solution is acid or base.

Q.   How does that help us to understand nicotine and nicotine addictions?

A.   So the more acid a solution is, the less free nicotine there is.  Most of it is bound.  The higher the pH, the more alkaline it is, the more base it is, the more free nicotine is present.  It's only the free nicotine that crosses biological membranes.  So the pH and the absolute amount of nicotine is important in the tobacco leaf.  So burley tobacco, for example, has twice as much nicotine per weight compared to flue cured tobacco, and flue cured tobacco has more nicotine than oriental or Turkish tobacco.

So tobacco is an agricultural product that is not consistent from one plant to the next or from one growing season to the next.

The nicotine is formatted in the roots of the tobacco plant and transferred to the leaves.  So if you

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=116
1537

have more roots, like in a dry growing season, you have higher nicotine concentrations in the leaf.  If you have a wet growing season, fewer roots, less nicotine transferred to the leaves.

So in order to make a Winston today like a Winston was yesterday or last year, they have to be able to blend these things together in order to have them come out to be the same.

Q.   And so in the blending process, does that affect the level of nicotine in the cigarette?

A.   It does.  And the other way that -- in more recent times, when you go from 1914 to the early 1950s, when they discovered that if you took the waste products, the veins and the stems from the tobacco plant, which they used to throw away, you could -- you could form what's called reconstituted tobacco by making it either into big flakes or into paper.  That's called reconstituted tobacco.  And for the modern cigarette, about 25 or 30 percent of the tobacco in them is called reconstituted tobacco.

And so this video is going to show a little bit about the process of how you make reconstituted tobacco, either by making it into a paper sheet or making it into what they call bandcast, which would be clumps.  And that becomes the place where all the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=117
1538

nicotine can be taken out or nicotine can be added back in order to make sure that the nicotine concentrations in a cigarette today is the same as it was last month and is the same as it is next month.

Q.   Okay.  Are the companies, including Reynolds, able to take nicotine totally out of cigarettes? MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor. Preemption.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  They've had that capability for 60 years. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Do they sell any cigarettes today with the nicotine removed?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor. Preemption.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  No, no.  There were a couple brands that had no nicotine in them, but they didn't sell.  There's a product from Philip Morris called Next, which was a denicotinized cigarette, but it didn't sell, because no one has become a smoker smoking cigarettes that do not contain nicotine. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=118
1539

Q.   Will this video help the jury to understand the blending process in the modern cigarette?

A.   It will help.  But the way I think about this is that when you think about a cigarette, don't think about crumpled tobacco leaves from a barn kind of mixed together.  Think about a highly sophisticated drug delivery device that is designed to get nicotine into the system very quickly.  And that's what the recon tobacco, reconstituted tobacco now is used to basically be able to adjust both the pH and the amount of nicotine present in the product.

Q.   Okay.  We're going to get to pH in a minute. Is it time for us to run the --

A.   Sure.

(A video was played in open court.)

A.   So these are the stems and the veins that are put all together.  They are chopped up.  So you think about a tobacco leaf like a leaf of a tree.  The meaty part of the tobacco is the one that has the highest nicotine concentrations.  That's called lamina.  And these are the veins of the -- of the tobacco leaf that used to be thrown away. Go ahead.

So this is where they extract -- they use an extraction process where water flows through these

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=119
1540

things to -- to take out nicotine as well as other substances.  The liquid, in some companies it's called mother liquor, which it's rich in nicotine, and it's taken out of those stems and other -- other waste products of the tobacco plant.

And then there are all kinds of different things that can be added.  I'm not sure.  This is probably a Philip Morris, but I'm not sure what this particular --

So these are things that can be added as additives.  This one is called DAP.  That is called diammonium phosphate.  And diammonium phosphate is used in the process of making reconstituted tobacco.  And diammonium phosphate not only does some things as far as the way the binding is made so that the sheets can come out in a sheet of paper, but diammonium phosphate also changes the pH, it increases the pH.  So this is the liquid --

Q.   What is the effect in a smoker with the increased pH?

A.   Well, it makes more free nicotine available to the smoker from the initial -- initial puff of tobacco.

Q.   Does that result in any sensation to the consumer/smoker?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=120
1541

A.   Well, it does.  There's sensation all the way from the upper, upper airways in the mouth.  It causes a more irritant effect.  But it also has an effect of increasing the absorption in the lungs.

Q.   We're going to get to that a little bit later.  Please proceed?

A.   So DAP, diammonium phosphate, is just one of the additives that's used to -- and it's used in all of the -- Reynolds as well.  Urea is another nitrogen containing solution.  Urea also is an ammonia type product, so it can be used to adjust the pH as well. Next one.

Q.   Why are they looking to adjust the pH?

A.   Well �

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, meaning and intent. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  In terms of -- in terms of nicotine delivery and in terms of addiction, why is the pH being adjusted?

A.   It affects the amount of free nicotine that's available in the smoke.  And it's the free nicotine that crosses the biological membrane.  So if you have more free nicotine in the lungs at the beginning, then it's absorbed more rapidly.

Q.   Please proceed.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=121
1542

A.   So urea is just another nitrogen containing compound.  It's in a big vat.

And I can't make out what this one is.  So this is another -- another additive that's there.

Now, these were the sheets of paper.  So they take all that, all those stems, they put them into a liquid, and they make them into big sheets of paper, just like you would make paper from wood pulp.  So these are the paper that is made that's called reconstituted tobacco.  And this is the process that Reynolds uses.

Philip Morris uses more of the bandcast, which is big blobs of the recon.

You can go ahead.

So these -- these -- they make it into paper, they dry it, and then here is where the mother liquor comes back.  So this is the liquid that was taken out to begin with and then mixed in the with additives of whatever they needed to add to the liquid, and then it's coated.  So the paper goes down into the liquid and it coats the paper with whatever formula that they want to use for whatever brand they are using and whatever the nicotine content needs to be and whatever the pH needs to be.

Q.   So do they take the nicotine out and put it

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=122
1543

back in?  Is that --

A.   They do.  They do.  But they also put other things in.  The big vats of DAP, urea and other things can be added to the recon.

Q.   Doctor, please proceed.

A.   So the paper then goes through the liquid, and it's dried again, then it's chopped up.  These are big vats where it's chopped up.  And then it's put into big hog's heads, these big containers, and it's crushed down and then this is the recon that then goes into the manufacturing process.  And the eventual is making the cigarettes at the very end.

So it's a very sophisticated process of making cigarettes today.  The original cigarette manufacturing machines could make 12,000 cigarettes in an hour.  The modern cigarette making machines make 20-to 30,000 cigarettes per minute.

Q.   How much engineering goes into that?

A.   It's highly sophisticated.  There are -- in these -- in these companies there are laboratories present, chemical laboratories present with mass spectrometers and other very sophisticated instruments to make sure that whatever is going into these is exactly what they want it to be.

MR. HARRISON:  May we approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Come on up.

MR. WICHMANN:  Oh, yeah.

(At the bench.)

MR. HARRISON:  Given what we've seen and are about to see, I think now is the time for the instruction.

THE COURT:  Now is the time for the instruction.  You want me to read the instruction?

MR. WICHMANN:  That's fine, Your Honor.

MR. HARRISON:  I think it would be, given his explanation of the video, to change the first part, "You have and you will hear evidence about additives and ingredients including ammonia."

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. WICHMANN:  And, Brad, so you know, I'm going to ask the Court for a lunch break here as soon as we finish the next slide, so we can give ourselves a break.

If that's okay with Your Honor?

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. WICHMANN:  Thank you.

(In open court.)

THE COURT:  I do have an instruction for you.

You have and you will hear evidence about

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=124
1545

additives and ingredients, including ammonia, used in the manufacture of cigarettes.  Such evidence is not being offered to show that any additive or ingredient made cigarettes more dangerous or addictive, and you may not consider such evidence for that purpose.

Mr. Wichmann, you may proceed. MR. WICHMANN:  May I proceed, Your Honor? THE COURT:  You may. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Have you seen this slide before today? A.   I have.

Q.   Okay.  Could you just briefly -- let's go through this together for the purpose -- for the edification of the jury.  First of all, what is a bronchodilator?

A.   Well, these are chemicals that make the bronchial tubes dilate so that the smoke can go further into the lungs.  So this is kind of a composite of a lot of different additives that have been used over the years.

Q.   Okay.  Explain to the jury what the significance of that is in terms of -- inhalability is in terms of the advent and development of the modern cigarette?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=125
1546

A.   Well, these are -- a variety of additives have been used to improve the delivery of the smoke to the lungs, and that's just one of them.

Q.   All right.  And I think we went over that, The tobacco companies control the delivery and amount of nicotine to ensure addiction.  We went over that?

A.   They do.  And even to the point of having the ability to know how many nanograms of nicotine there are in a puff of cigarette smoke.

Q.   How about flavorings?  The upper right-hand corner.  Do the companies, does R.J. Reynolds add any flavorings to their cigarettes?

A.   They do.  And everything from licorice to coumarin.  Coumarin is not used very much any more. But there are a variety of flavorants that are used that make one brand different than the next brand.

Q.   Why do they do that?

A.   Well, so nicotine is pretty harsh, and so a lot of this is due -- the flavorings are used to disguise how harsh the nicotine really is.

Q.   The next section down.  Tobacco-specific nitrosamines.

Please tell the jury in simple terms what those are.

A.   Well, the tobacco-specific nitrosamines are

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=126
1547

some of the cancer causing substances that are present. And American cigarettes have a preponderance of that. Even smokeless tobacco has more of those in the United States than they do in other places.  So these are just part of the things that are present in cigarettes that can cause cancer.

Q.   Now, has science been able to identify how many tobacco-specific nitrosamines there are in --cancer-causing nitrosamines there are in cigarettes and cigarette smoke?

A.   That continues to change almost every year, because, as science continues to advance, more things are recognized as being cancer causing.  So it will be different this year than it was last year.

Q.   More or less?

A.   More.

Q.   And do you know how many, approximately, there are now?

A.   I do not.

Q.   More than --

A.   Not off the top of my head.

Q.   Fine.  We'll proceed then.  The next one is ammonia compounds.

A.   We've already talked about that.  Ammonia compounds increase the pH, which increases the speed of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=127
1548

delivery.

Q.   How about menthol?

A.   Menthol is one that is present in almost every brand of cigarettes, even the nonmenthol labeled cigarettes, because --

Q.   What is menthol?

A.   Menthol is a naturally occurring chemical, and it says here, which it really does, it cools and basically numbs the back of the throat.  There is something called eugenol that is similar to what's used in menthol.  But menthol makes it more palatable to inhale the tobacco smoke.

Q.   Let me just clarify.  I'd like to clarify something.  You said a naturally occurring substance. Is it naturally occurring in cigarettes, or is it a natural occurring substance that the companies add to their cigarettes?

A.   That's what they do.  So -- so it's not --it's naturally occurring.  And you have menthol in a lot of other things besides cigarettes.  But it's added to the cigarettes.  And almost every brand of cigarettes has some menthol in it.  And then the menthol branded cigarettes, like Kool and Salem and Newport, have much more menthol.  But it really makes it more palatable.  It reduces the throat irritation

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=128
1549

and makes the smoke feel smoother.  So that's why it's added to all cigarettes, not just the mentholated cigarettes.

Q.   What other products contain menthol?

A.   Oh, there are mentholated cough drops, all kinds of different things, that menthol is a cooling sort of -- sort of compound.

Q.   All right.  And what are -- what is the levulinic acid?

A.   Levulinic acid is one of the things that can be added that has an effect on the receptors.  And there's a lot of research on that.  And some of the brands have had that in the past.  But it's not always consistent across the brands.

Q.   Okay.  And at the bottom, sugars.  And --

A.   Sugars are added to balance some of the pH. So the more sugar you put into the equation, it helps to lower the pH.  It balances off some of the other things that would be there to add -- increase the pH.

Acetaldehyde, all by itself, has an affect on the brain.  And acetaldehyde is a chemical, an aldehyde that some people think increases the addictive nature of the product.

Q.   Doctor, did you, during the -- during your review of the information in this case, were you able

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=129
1550

to learn whether or not Terry Rounds smoked filtered cigarettes?

A.   He did.  He initially smoked unfiltered Lucky's, I think was the one I remember, but then switched to filtered cigarettes and then to light, low tar/low nicotine cigarettes.

Q.   Just briefly, because I would like to take a break after this and go to another slide.  But would you tell the jury just in general terms what ventilated filters are in cigarettes?

A.   Well, back in the sixties, there was an effort to reduce the delivery of nicotine and tar that came out of the end of the cigarette.  And the way --the way the tar and nicotine was measured was technology called the Federal Trade Commission machine, which measured the amount of nicotine and tar that came out of the end of the cigarette.  So one of the ways to reduce that amount is to add holes, ventilation holes in the tipping paper, so that when you smoke, the machine smoked a cigarette, it brings in air into the stream of smoke, and it dilutes the stream of smoke and makes the machine register lower tar and lower nicotine.

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, I'm going to stop you there, because after the lunch break we'll get into that some

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=130
1551

more.  But this demonstrative has a little more information there.  Would you read what it says under "ventilated filters"?

A.   Well, when the person is -- is exposed to a ventilated filter in low tar/low nicotine cigarettes, they do this.  Smokers inhale more vigorously, and they change the way that they smoke, drawing carcinogens further into the lungs.  We call that compensation, because the smoker is smoking for a spike of nicotine, and if the ventilation holes allow more air to get into the stream of smoke, then they are not getting the amount of nicotine that they would from a cigarette that had no ventilation holes, or fewer.  So they inhale deeper, hold their breath, smoke more cigarettes.  They compensate, because smokers smoke for the nicotine, not for the amount of nicotine and tar that's in the stream of smoke.

MR. WICHMANN:  All right.  Your Honor, I

think this might be a good spot to take our lunch

break.

THE COURT:  All right.  Ladies and gentlemen,

we'll go ahead and recess for lunch.  Be back at

1:15.  Fifteen after 1:00.

THE COURT:  All right.  Everybody can be seated.  Anything you want to take up before we go to lunch?

MR. WICHMANN:  Well, Your Honor, what I would like to do is speak with Mr. Harrison about -- on this, what I think his specific objection is, see if we can't work it out ourselves.  So the hope is to get Dr. Hurt finished here in another maybe hour and a half or so, two hours, as long as we can get him out by 4:15.  Then we'll talk about getting him back next week.  But I will speak with Mr. Harrison about the one.

THE COURT:  So you are not as hopeful as to finishing Dr. Hurt today, I guess?

MR. WICHMANN:  Well, I think I may finish my direct.  I should finish my direct of Dr. Hurt today.  I don't know how much time he needs for his cross.

THE COURT:  I don't want to rush anybody.

MR. HARRISON:  If he has an hour or so, I think it's incredibly unlikely that Dr. Hurt finishes today.  If we get done soon after, there's still a chance.

THE COURT:  All right.  Okay.  Well, if it happens, it happens.  I don't want to push

PROCEEDINGS

(Court called to order at 1:16 p.m.)

THE COURT:  All right.  Please be seated.

All right.  Doctor, you can come on up and take a seat.

(The witness resumed the stand.)

THE COURT:  All right.  Are we ready?

MR. WICHMAN:  Yes, Your Honor.  I would like to tell you that we had a rather stupendous occurrence.  Mr. Harrison and I reached an agreement on that disputed exhibit.  And the agreement is that Plaintiffs are not going to use the Koop video that they have objections to with Dr. Hurt, but we reserve the right to use it with Dr. Cummings.  And I believe that will take care of that problem.

THE COURT:  All right.  So we don't have an agreement today, but we kicked it down -- we kicked the can down the road a little bit.  All right.

MR. WICHMAN:  Friday afternoon, Judge.

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Okay. Otherwise, we're ready?

MR. WICHMAN:  Otherwise, we're ready, at least from the plaintiff.

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Bring them in (The jury returned to the courtroom at 1:21 p.m.)

THE COURT:  All right.  Everybody can be seated.

All right.  Mr. Wichmann, whenever you are ready.

MR. WICHMAN:  Thank you, Your Honor. CONTINUED EXAMINATION BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, before the lunch break, we were talking about filters and compensation that smokers would do to inhale more vigorously and get the carcinogens deeper in the lung.  Do you recall that? A.   I do.

Q.   Did you bring with you today a separate set of slides for -- that show Winston filter tips? A.   I did.

MR. WICHMAN:  Would you put that up, please. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Could you explain to the jury, please, what this slide depicts?

A.   So this is the tipping paper, this cork over here, magnified to show the laser perforations, the ventilation holes.  So these are very precise laser

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1562

perforations.  And so you can see that on the Winston Light, low tar, low nicotine Winston, there are two rows of ventilation holes that are present.

Q.   Is this a light cigarette, the Winston Light, or is this the Winston --

A.   This is a Winston Light.

Q.   By the way, is Philip -- or is R.J. Reynolds allowed to call their cigarettes light cigarettes today?

A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  And why is that?

A.   Because they never were.

Q.   Who prevents them from doing that?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   And explain to the jury why light cigarettes never were light cigarettes.

A.   Well, the tobacco in the rod is basically the same from one cigarette to the other.  Every cigarette will contain between 9 and 11 milligrams of nicotine, the rod will.  So the ventilation holes allow the machine rates for tar and nicotine to be lower compared to a regular full-flavored cigarette, but it didn't change any of the other things.  So the data on this is

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=142
1563

very clear, that having filters, first of all, and then low tar, low nicotine cigarettes, secondly, over time did not change the death and disability from cigarette smoking, period.

Q.   So is it fair to say that light cigarettes are no safer than other filtered cigarettes?

A.   That's correct.  The tobacco is the same.  So most people, most smokers, when you present this to them, will say, Well, I thought these were going to be safer, because they're labeled to be light, and they no longer can claim that, because they never were to begin with.

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Speculation,

hearsay, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   What is the purpose of the -- well, what do the ventilation holes do, in this slide?

A.   Well, the ventilation holes allow for air to be pulled into the stream of smoke and it allows -- so you have more ventilation holes than the stream of smoke is more dilute.  And the smoker perceives that to be lighter and less harsh on the back of the throat, because it really is, because the concentration of the cigarette smoke is diluted by the air.  But then the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=143
1564

smoker who switches from a regular, full-flavored cigarette, like a red label Winston to a gold label Winston, they will compensate.  They will smoke them more aggressively, inhale deeper, hold their breath longer, take bigger puffs, or they simply smoke more cigarettes.  Some figure out that if they cover up the ventilation holes with their fingers, then they can get a higher delivery just by doing that.

Q.   And in your studies and in your research, is that act by smokers a conscious or unconscious act?

A.   Well, it can be either.  Most smokers do it unconsciously.  Just because of where the ventilation holes are on the filter tipping paper, they don't realize -- they can't see them.  They can't see that they're there, even though the manufacturer trade magazine say we could make these holes visible if you wanted us to.  And in some cigarettes they are, like Carlton.  And some cigarettes have holes that are so big you can actually see them with the naked eye. We've had some people who will consciously cover the holes with cellophane tape in order to get the higher concentration of smoke.  So it be can either unconscious or conscious.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you show the next slide

please, Dan?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=144
1565

BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   And what does that slide show?

A.   So this is a Winston Red.  This is what's called a, quote, full-flavored cigarette.  And you can see it has one row of ventilation holes.  Again, you can't see them with the naked eye.  They are there. But then when you magnify it up, you can see.  So the major difference between this cigarette and the one before is one has one row of the ventilation holes and the other one has two rows of ventilation holes.

MR. WICHMAN:  Go to the next slide, please,

Dan. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   What does this slide show us?

A.   It is a schematic kind of showing what I have explained.  And these aren't Winston, these are actually Marlboro, but I didn't have -- when I was doing all this, I didn't have a slide made up of every brand, because the concept is the same.

So this one has two rows of ventilation holes, like the Winston Light did.  This has one row of ventilation holes, like the Winston Red did.  And you can see the smoke density is more dense here than it is there.  So the smoker perceives that they are lighter, and -- because the air makes them feel lighter.  But

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=145
1566

then they change the way they smoke.  So if you have a person changing from this cigarette to that one and then measure the amount of nicotine and other metabolites in the blood from nicotine, they are the same.

So the smoker compensates by smoking more aggressively and getting the amount of nicotine that they wanted, irrespective of which brand or which type of cigarette that it is.

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, are you familiar with a document called Monograph 13? A.   I am.

Q.   Could you tell the jury what that document was?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, hearsay.

MR. WICHMAN:  Okay.

MS. PARKER:  Bolstering. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   In a historical context, did the U.S. government come to the conclusion that low tar and filtered cigarettes were no healthier than regular cigarettes?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Hearsay. Bolstering.

THE COURT:  All right.  Is there an exception

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=146
1567

that's a hearsay or no?

MR. WICHMAN:  Sure, Judqe.

THE COURT:  Come on up. (At the bench.)

MR. WICHMAN:  For purposes of --

THE COURT:  Is this a qovernment report?

MR. WICHMAN:  Yeah, but I'm not qoinq to offer it into evidence.  I'm just qoinq to ask him questions very quickly about it, what it was, what its historical context of it in terms of low tar ciqarettes.  And he's pretty much covered it all, but I just wanted to put it in a historical perspective.  Because the testimony from Dr. Cumminqs is qoinq to be that the companies actually were able to manipulate the machines that requlate the filters and low tar ciqarettes, and it wasn't until Monoqraph 18 (sic), and then later we have internal documents that refer to that, that Dr. Cumminqs will testify -- or Dr. Hurt will testify about.

THE COURT:  All riqht.  Overruled.

MR. WICHMAN:  Okay.  Thank you. (In open court.) BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   I will ask the question aqain, because I

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=147
1568

don't recall whether you gave the answer.  Are you familiar with Monograph 13?

A.   I am.

Q.   In terms of human smoking behavior, filters and low tar cigarettes, what is the significance of that document?

A.   Well, what it did, it took all --

Q.   First, tell the jury what it is.

A.   Well, it's a document from the U.S. government.  It's basically like a Surgeon General's report in many respects, because what it did was it did an assessment of whether or not filters or low tar nicotine cigarettes were -- had changed the -- reduced the death and disability caused by cigarette smoking. That's basically what this did.  It took all the evidence that was in the scientific literature, put it in one place.

Q.   Okay.  And what was the overall conclusion?

A.   That the change in cigarette design with filters and low tar, low nicotine cigarettes did not reduce the morbidity and mortality from cigarette smoking, period.

Q.   And do you, Doctor, know what the date was that that conclusion, that document came out?

A.   Well, I want to say 2001, but I could be off

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=148
1569

by?

Q.   Actually, I think you're not, but --

A.   The first thing that goes is the memory.  I can't remember what the second thing was.

Q.   Doctor, switching gears here, for the rest of the afternoon I would like to talk about what the cigarette industry knew and when they knew it about nicotine and the addictive properties of nicotine.

A.   Okay.

Q.   First of all, let me ask you, Doctor, in 1996, could anybody go on the Internet and get the previously secret internal industry documents that address that subject?

A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  Did the federal government even know about those documents prior to 1996?

A.   Not to my knowledge.

Q.   Did the state of Florida know about those documents before 1996?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Speculation, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   If you know.  Do you know if the state of Florida knew about -- do you know if the state of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=149
1570

Minnesota knew about those documents before 1996?

MR. HARRISON:  Same objection, Your Honor. Speculation.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  If he has information, you can ask for the information, just don't ask him to speculate. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Okay.  Well, Doctor, how did you first come to be involved in the research and study of previously secret internal tobacco industry documents?

A.   I was the first witness in the Minnesota tobacco trial, which went to trial in 1998.

Q.   Without going into great detail, would you explain to the jury how it is that you, during that process, came to learn about the internal industry documents?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'm going to overrule on that question.  But I don't want you getting any deeper.

MR. WICHMAN:  Right.

THE WITNESS:  So my testimony in the Minnesota tobacco trial was to be focused on addiction pH, low tar, low nicotine cigarettes,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=150
1571

were the three main areas.  So the attorneys for

the State had different categories of documents,

and I was able to look at thousands of pages.  I

didn't keep track of them, but big banker boxes

full of documents that had been previously secret

in preparation for the trial. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   When was the first time that you saw those documents?

A.   I saw them -- I began seeing them in 1996.

Q.   Before that, are you aware of whether or not those documents were available to the State of Minnesota?

A.   They were not.

Q.   Okay.  Do you know, as you sit here today, if, prior to reviewing the documents in 1996, they were available to -- widely available in America?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Speculation, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  You just need to

rephrase it as to his knowledge. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   In your -- to the best of your knowledge, were the documents that you first reviewed in 1996 from the cigarette industry available to the rest of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=151
1572

America?

A.   They were not.

Q.   Where did you go to see these documents?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.

THE COURT:  If you think there is relevance, come on up and tell me what you think it is.

MR. WICHMAN:  Sure.

(At the bench.)

MR. WICHMAN:  All right.

THE COURT:  Now, we know there were documents that came out in the Minnesota litigation.  What else do you need to know?

MR. WICHMAN:  Because I'm going to lay the foundation a little bit later this afternoon for the admission of the BATCo documents that were British American Tobacco Company documents, because Brown & Williamson, which is an Engle defendant that acquired BATCo, and Reynolds eventually acquired all of them, had documents, in particular the structured creativity document, in their British American repository in the UK.  And he was the first American scientist or historian to be allowed access to those records.  And he was actually the first to be allowed access to the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=152
1573

previously secret documents in this country.

I will tell the jury how he indexed them and how -- that goes to his expertise --

I'm sorry, Judge.  I didn't mean to interrupt.

THE COURT:  I'm just -- what's the relevance to what issue in this case?

MR. WICHMAN:  Well, I think Your Honor yesterday said that I would need to lay a predicate for the admission of that particular BATCo document.  And that was going to be one of the documents that he actually found in the repository when they went to England.  But this is going to be just two minutes, and then I need to have him explain to the jury.

THE COURT:  As far as authentication, were you going to be disputing authentication of these documents?

MR. HARRISON:  The BATCo document, that's the basis of the objection.  I know he got it in Europe.  So no, I will not -- he doesn't have to lay the foundation.

THE COURT:  You don't need to lay a foundation for authentication.  They are not objecting to that.  I don't see why it's relevant.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=153
1574

MR. WICHMAN:  Okay.  That's fine, Judge.  And then I just want to ask him how he identified the documents, how he indexed them, how he put them in broad categories.  The jury can understand that he is an expert on all these internal documents.

THE COURT:  Don't get too far � don't get far into those weeds, though. MR. WICHMAN:  Okay.

MR. HARRISON:  Thank you, Your Honor. (In open court.) BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Doctor, I think you told us that you were allowed access to a collection of previously secret internal industry documents, correct? A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.  How did you index those documents to identify which documents went where or pertained to what subject?

A.   Well, they were -- there is -- there was an index that was held by the companies that could put them into different categories.  And the state of Minnesota asked for those -- though indices, which they had a lot of legal fighting about that.  But then the attorneys for State went through document after document after document and placed them in categories,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=154
1575

and for the different witnesses. And mine was focused on pH, low tar, low nicotine cigarettes and addiction. That's the set of documents that I reviewed.

Q.   Subsequent to the Minnesota trial, did you apply for any grants to do tobacco document research?

A.   I did.

Q.   And who did you apply to for those grants?

A.   The National Cancer Institute.

Q.   All right.  And were you selected for that?

A. Correct. And that's a peer-reviewed process, like any other grant process. You had to compete with other people to be able to successfully get a grant.

Q.   By then, where were the documents physically located?

A.   Well, after the Minnesota trial, they were placed in depositories in Minneapolis, and the second depository was Guildford, UK, which is the home of BAT

Q.   So you were allowed access to the repository in Minneapolis, correct?  To conduct your research?

A.   And the depository in England as well.

Q.   Okay.  How long did that grant last?

A.   Nine years.

Q.   Did you have a set of subjects that you were looking into?

A.   Well, the focus of our game was on secondhand

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=155
1576

smoke and what the industry knew about that and when they knew it and what they did about it.  But any time you do document research like this, you come across other documents that have some relevance to not just that topic but other things.  So we wrote mainly about secondhand smoke and the dangers of secondhand smoke, but we wrote other articles based on the document research as we came across things that were of interest.

Q. Okay. And during the course of your research and publishing on the internal industry documents, did you come across some of the documents that we're going to discuss this afternoon?

A.   I did.  And in fact, the first article we wrote was based on the Minnesota tobacco trial, and Dr. Robertson and I wrote an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association based on what we had found in the documents that we used as evidence in the Minnesota trial.

Q.   What is the Legacy Library?

A.   The Legacy Library is at the University of California San Francisco.  So after Minnesota, there were 33 million pages of documents that were released as a result of Minnesota and made to put into the public domain.  So there were different websites that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=156
1577

had the documents, but they never were collected in one

central place until the University of California

San Francisco got a grant from the Legacy Foundation to

basically store and digitize the documents in

San Francisco and make them widely available across the

world.

Q.   Before they were -- before that process was finished, were the internal industry documents widely available across the world?

A.   Well, there were some that were on industry websites.  There was another, TBO, Tobacco Documents Online, was another private group that was putting them up.  But it never was as big a collection as it is at UCSF.

Q.   Do you know which year the Legacy Library was first -- was first opened?

A.   I don't recall.  It probably was in -- well, I don't recall.

Q.   Okay.  Was it after � or after 1996?

A.   Oh, yeah.  The documents did not become public until the Minnesota trial was over in May of 1998.  And the settlement that was reached mandated that the documents that were disclosed be made public. MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.  Move

to strike and irrelevant at this point.

	THE COURT:  All right.  Sustained.


	MR. WICHMAN:  Just one more question.

BY MR. WICHMAN:
	
Q.
	And that is, prior to May of 1998, what --

were the
	internal industry documents searchable on the

Internet
	by the general public, if you know?

A.
	No, not to my knowledge.

Q.
	Thank you.


	Did R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company know that

nicotine
	was an addictive drug prior to Terry Rounds'

death in
	1996?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Did they disclose that to the American

public?
	

A.
	No.

Q.
	Doctor, had they disclosed what they knew

about nicotine and addiction to the American public in
	
1955, would that have affected the way you treated your
	
patients
	for addiction while you were at the Mayo

Clinic?
	


	MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.  Calls

for

	THE COURT:  Sustained.

BY MR. WICHMAN:
	
Q.
	We won't to go that.  Let's go through some

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=158
1579

of these documents, and we'll revisit that.

MR. WICHMAN:  Would you put up PT 4 7 91,

please? BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, have you seen this document before coming down here today?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it says "RJR confidential."

A.   Correct.

Q.   Was this one of the documents that were --that were secret prior to May of 1998?

A.   It was.

Q.   Okay.  Tell the jury, please, who wrote this -- this document?

A.   This is a document by Dr. Claude Teague, who was a chemist at Reynolds, came to Reynolds in the early 1950s.  And so he's speaking about the role of nicotine and its crucial role in cigarette smoking.

Q.   Do you know the date that this document was written?

A.   I want to say 1973, but I could be off.

Q.   Okay.  Could you turn to page 2, please?

What does Dr. Teague write about the tobacco industry in the first paragraph?

A.   He says, In a sense, the tobacco industry may

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=159
1580

be thought as being a specialized, highly ritualized, and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry. Tobacco products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects.

Q.   And what does he say about the design and manufacture and sale of doses of nicotine in this document?

A.   Thus, a tobacco product is, in essence, a vehicle for delivery of nicotine, designed to deliver the nicotine in a generally acceptable and attractive form.  Our industry is then based upon design, manufacture and sale of attractive dosage forms of nicotine, and our company's position in our industry is determined by our ability to produce dosage forms of nicotine which have more overall value, tangible or intangible, to the consumer than those of our competition.

Q.   Was this the public position of Reynolds in the 1970s?

A.   Not to my knowledge.

Q.   Turn to page 3, please.

Does Dr. Teague write in this document about nicotine satisfaction?

A.   He does.

Q.        What   does   he   say?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=160
1581

A.   He said, Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and unique in its variety of physiological actions.  Hence, no other active material or combination of materials provides equivalent, quote, satisfaction, end quote, period.

Q.   In the nicotine addiction treatment community, what does "habituating" mean?

A.   Say it again.

Q.   What does "habituating" mean?

A.   Well, in -- "habituating" is a word we don't use very often in the addictions field, because this is much more than a habit.  But that was fairly common usage back in the '70s among people.  But we -- it's a behavior, it's a repetitive behavior that has its origins in the central nervous system.  So saying it's a habit is -- it trivializes how difficult that it is.

Q.   Well, let's look at the paragraph at the bottom.  Would you please read that to the jury?

A.   If nicotine is the sine qua non of tobacco products, and tobacco products are recognized as being attractive dosage forms of nicotine, then it is logical to design our products and, where possible, our advertising around nicotine delivery rather than, quote, tar, end quote, delivery or flavor.  To do this, we need to develop new data on such things as the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=161
1582

physiological effects of nicotine, the rate of absorption and elimination of nicotine delivered in different doses at different frequencies and by different routes and ways of enhancing or diminishing nicotine effects and, quote, satisfactions, end quote.

Q.   What does "sine qua non" mean?

A.   "Sine qua non" means without which not, is the literal interpretation of it.  So it's essential for whatever you're talking about.

So nicotine is an essential in tobacco products.  And that's -- I have said this before, that nicotine is the driving force behind tobacco dependence or nicotine addiction.

Q.   Could you turn to page 5, please?

The paragraph -- there you go.  Doctor, did R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company play down the role of nicotine publicly?

A.   Well, publicly, it was never really talked about as being an addicting drug at all.  And so there was not -- not really common knowledge about that coming from the tobacco industry, about nicotine being an addicting drug.

Q.   What did Dr. Teague write about the public position of Reynolds at that time regarding the role of nicotine and smoking?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=162
1583

A.   So the red underlining says, We have deliberately played down the role of nicotine.  Hence, the nonsmoker has little or no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer him, and no desire to try it.  Instead, we somehow must convince him with wholly irrational reasons that he should try smoking in the hope that he will for himself then discover the, quote, real satisfactions, end quote, obtainable.

Q.   Doctor, so we can identify the players here, did you bring with you a chart of the high level executives for R.J. Reynolds?

A.   I did.

Q.   Okay.  I will go to the ELMO.

First of all, could you tell the jury what year this chart is from?

A.   I believe this is 1973.

Q.   Around the time that that memo was authored?

A.   So it's October of '73, it says at the bottom of the chart.

Q.   Starting from the top, who was Dr. Murray Senkus?

A.   He was the director for research for R.J. Reynolds.

Q.   And what was his training and experience?

A.   I think he was -- I think he was a chemist.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=163
1584

Dr. Teague is the assistant director.  He was a chemist.

Q.   And I have circled there Dr. F.G. Colby.  Who was he?

A.   Dr. Colby was the person who did their science information.  So he collected things.  But he also was a doctor, had a doctorate degree in organic chemistry.  So chemistry was a big part of this group.

Q.   Were any of these individuals, to your knowledge, medical doctors?

A.   Not to my knowledge, no.

Q.   And what position did Dr. Teague hold at the time that we think he wrote that memo that we just read?

A.   He -- according to this chart, he was the assistant director, reported directly to Dr. Senkus, and Dr. Senkus reported directly up the chain of command.

Q.   Did Dr. Teague retire from R.J. Reynolds?

A.   He did.

Q.   And what position did he hold when he retired, if you know?

A.   I think he was director for research, but I could be wrong about that.  But he was a very high-level, high-level person for his entire career.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1585

Q. I need to show you another chart here from the same exhibit, 1973, of the employees. Have you seen this before coming down today?

A.   I have.

Q.   And just generally, what does this show?

A.   Well, it just shows the chain of command reaching all the way down here.  From here it's --Dr. Tucker was the vice-president for marketing. Dr. Senkus is the vice-president for -- director for research.  Going up to the president, Mr. Hobbs, who then reported up to the CEO at that time, was Mr. Smith.  So it just shows, when you see these names of the people that were involved, they are very high-level executives and high-level researchers.

Q.   Were any of them, to your knowledge, medical doctors?

A.   Not to my knowledge.

Q.   Okay.  Were any of the individuals from Reynolds, whose names appear on these two documents, to your knowledge, studying cures for cancer?

Q.   So during the entire time that Reynolds concealed the information concerning nicotine from the American public, do you know whether they had any programs to spend money and research and find a cure

for lung cancer?

A.   Not to my knowledge.

Q.   Do you know if at any time prior to 1998, when the documents became public, whether R.J. Reynolds had any programs in place to help addicted smokers quit smoking their product?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.  Calls for speculation. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Do you know?

THE COURT:  I will allow that question. THE WITNESS:  Not to my knowledge. MR. WICHMAN:  Bring up PT -- I'm sorry. I would like to move into evidence at this point in time previous document PT 4791. May I approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Any objection? MR. HARRISON:  No, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  That will be accepted as Plaintiff's 4.

A.
	I have.

Q.
	And who was Kenneth H. Hoover?

A.
	He was the director for research.

Q.
	Okay.  Did he have a medical background, if

you kn
	ow?

A.
	Not that I know.

Q.
	When was this document authored?

A.
	1959.

Q.
	All right.  What is the title of it?

A.
	The optimum composition of tobacco and its

smoke.
	

Q.
	Would you turn to page 4, please?  Lower

right-
	land corner.  Who authored this document?

A.
	Mr. -- I think it's Dr. Alan Rodgman.

Q.
	Do you know who Dr. Allen Rodgman was?

A.
	He is chemist.  I think he's still alive,

unlike
	Dr. Teague.

Q.
	All right.  So we have a chemist writing to

the VP
	of research --

A.
	Correct.

Q.

Q.   Look at the lower right-hand portion of this document, Doctor.

Not there.  Go all the way over. Would you read to the jury what the chemist wrote to the VP of research at Reynolds?

A.   So some 30-odd polycyclic hydrocarbons have since been similarly characterized in these laboratories.  Of these, eight are carcinogenic to mouse epidermis.  Cholanthrene, a potent carcinogen, is one of the three not yet reported by other investigators.

Q.   And it continues to say what at the top of the next page?

A.   The physiological requirements of the smoker with respect to nicotine can be met by the application of optimum amount of nicotine to the extracted tobacco.

Q.   So in this document, what are they discussing?

A.   Well, they're discussing two things.  They're doing analyses of carcinogens and trying to figure out what carcinogens are present.  And the mouse painting experiments is where they put these carcinogens or these compounds on the back of mice to see if they develop cancer.

Then the other is basically taking nicotine

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=168
1589

out, extracting it and putting it back in to extract the tobacco.

Q.   So they are discussing nicotine and they are discussing that smoking causes cancer, correct? MR. HARRISON:  Objection, leading, Your

Honor. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Are they discussing whether or not there are cancer-causing chemicals in the cigarette smoke? MR. HARRISON:  Leading, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Don't lead. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   What are they discussing regarding cancer-causing chemicals in their product, if anything, in this document?

A.   They are discussing finding new ones that had not been discovered before.  And he mentions one that had not been discovered in other laboratories.

Q.   If you look at the -- go back to the previous page, please, the bottom of it.  Are they also here beginning at in April of 1959, are they also discussing flavors and flavorants in their cigarettes? MR. HARRISON:  Objection, leading. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   What are they discussing regarding flavorants

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=169
1590

in this document, Doctor?

A.   Well, they're talking about the physical and chemical properties of the cigarette.

Q.   Okay.  If you look at the top of the next page, please.  Could you read the first sentence?

A.   The addition of suitable flavorants to the pretreated tobacco should restore the desired flavor.

So they're talking of all the different things that they could go to make the product more attractive, figuring out what carcinogens are present, but also how to basically manipulate the nicotine content.

Q.   What you told us about earlier today?

A.   Pardon?

Q.   What we discussed earlier today?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Doctor, was the information contained in this document secret before May of 1998?

A.   It was.

Q.   Do you know whether R.J. Reynolds ever disclosed this information to the U.S. Surgeon General before May of 1998?

A.   Not to my knowledge.

MR. HARRISON:  No objection, Your Honor.  But under the rule of completeness, the partial sentence he read, can we go back to page 3 and read the sentence before and the beginning of that particular sentence?

THE COURT:  All right.  We'll accept PT 2141 as Plaintiff's 5.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 5 admitted.)

THE COURT:  And, Doctor, can you read the full -- can you put the full sentence up there for them, please.

MR. HARRISON:  And the sentence before, leading into it.

THE COURT:  Oh, and the sentence before that.

MR. HARRISON:  Just the bottom two sentences. The bottom two lines is all I'm looking for. There you go.

THE WITNESS:  The scheme under consideration will greatly reduce the polycyclic hydrocarbons in smoke.  The flavor of the smoke should be --should not be adversely affected, I think it said.

MR. HARRISON:  Thank you, Your Honor. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Doctor.  Who was, Sir Charles Ellis?

A.   Sir Charles Ellis was a physicist from the UK

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=171
1592

who had his reputation mainly from doing physics, nuclear physics, but he became a scientific advisor for British American Tobacco.

Q.   What was the relationship between British American Tobacco, Brown & Williamson, R.J. Reynolds, if any?  Could you explain that briefly to the jury?

A.   Well, British American Tobacco was a company that was formed in the early part of the -- of the 20th century, and then Brown & Williamson became a company in the same part of the first part of the 20th century. And in 1927, BAT acquired Brown & Williamson as a subsidiary.  So BAT was located in the UK, and Brown & Williamson was in Louisville, Kentucky.  And then as time went on, in nineteen -- I think it was 1994, then Brown & Williamson acquired the old American Tobacco Company, and then Brown & Williamson was acquired by Reynolds and became -- the new company called Reynolds American in the first part of the 21st century.

Q.   So as we sit here today, does Reynolds American own American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson?

A.   Well, it used to be American Tobacco Company and Brown & Williamson.  Yes.

Q.   When Brown & Williamson and BATCo were together, did they share information concerning

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=172
1593

nicotine and smoking and health with each other between the two companies?

A.   They did.  There was an agreement going --dating back to the 1950s where BAT and

Brown & Williamson shared research information across lines.

MR. WICHMAN:  Would you put up, please,

PT1945. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Have you seen this document before today?

A.   I have.

Q.   And tell the jury, please, what the date is on this document.

A.   1962.

Q.   And was this document available publicly at that time?

A.   No.

Q.   And what is the title of the document?

A.   The Effects of Smoking, Proposal For Future Research Contracts with Battelle.

Q.   Okay.  Explain to the jury what that -- what the significance of that statement is.

A.   Battelle was a research organization in the UK that did work for British American Tobacco.

Q.   And what were they doing research on?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=173
1594

A.   Oh, they did research on a lot of different things.  Nicotine itself and then potentially health effects.  They did a lot of work across the board for BAT.

Q.   And did BAT share that information with Brown & Williamson?

A.   They did.  This was -- they had the agreement between the two companies dating back to the 1950s, where they collaborated and they would share information and share costs of the research as well. MR. WICHMAN:  Could you highlight the first

paragraph, please? BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Read that to the jury, please.

A.   So research contracts with Battelle started in February 1959.  The overall objective is to increase our knowledge of the physiological and psychological effects of smoking and to explore the possibilities of obtaining the same results by a device other than the cigarette.

Q.   What is the significance of that document?

A.   Well, they actually were looking for some other way to deliver nicotine other than by a cigarette.  It was called Project Arial.  That was the whole purpose of some of this, was to find if they

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=174
1595

could deliver nicotine in the same way that the cigarettes did.

Q.   Were they ever able to find that, to your knowledge, if you know?

A.   Not to my knowledge.

Q.   Has there ever been a way to deliver nicotine as efficient here as a cigarette?

A.   No.

MR. WICHMAN:  Your Honor, Plaintiff's would

offer in PT1945, please.

MR. HARRISON:  No objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  That will be accepted

as Plaintiff's 6.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 6 admitted.) BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   The second page of that document, Doctor, 1945, please, would you read the first paragraph, please?  "As a result of."

A.   As a result of these various researchers, we now possess a knowledge of the effects of nicotine far more extensive than exists in published scientific literature.  It is, indeed, so extensive and represents so much new thought that it is not easy to condense the material of these several reports and working papers without the risk of oversimplification.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=175
1596

Q.   Do you know if the information that they possessed that they refer to in this internal document, the knowledge of the effects of nicotine, was that ever -- was that disclosed to the Surgeon General before the 1964 Surgeon General's report?

A.   It was not.

Q.   Doctor, who knows the most about cigarettes? MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.

Speculation.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   As to compare R.J. Reynolds with the public health community in the '60s, which had superior knowledge concerning the health effects and the addictive nature of cigarettes?

MR. HARRISON:  Same objection.  Speculation,

Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Doctor, did the companies conceal this information in the 1960s from the American public?

A.   They did.

Q.   All right.  Did the public health community and the American public know as much about the cigarette and nicotine as BATCo did in this document?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Speculation. THE COURT:  Rephrase. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Doctor, how much knowledge did the public health community have based on your research and study on the effects of nicotine in the published scientific literature at that time in 1962?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Speculation, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  Rephrase. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Doctor, have you studied how much information there was in 1962 in published scientific literature on nicotine in the United States?

A.   We've looked at it, and I think they make the correct statement, that they knew about it more than anyone else did.

Q.   In terms of the components in cigarettes, have you studied how much knowledge there was in published scientific literature in the 1960s?

A.   We have.

Q.   Have you studied how much knowledge there was secretly on that subject within the industry documents?

A.   Well, that was the whole subject of the article we wrote for JAMA, which the most revealing

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=177
1598

thing was what they knew about pH and pH manipulation and freebasing nicotine. That was totally unknown to the public health community.

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.

Nonresponsive and speculation. THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Based on your research in published scientific literature in the '60s and the internal industry documents in the '60s, where did most of the information concerning nicotine lie?

A.   In the cigarette industry as a whole, some companies knew more than others.  But it was -- it was there within the industry.

Q.   Doctor, do you think that they still had more information in the '70s than -- internally than they were telling the American public concerning nicotine and its effects through the cigarette?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  No foundation.

Speculation.

THE COURT:  Lay a foundation. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q. Have you studied how much information the cigarette industry had concerning nicotine and the dangers of smoking in the '70s?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=178
1599

A.   We have.

Q.   Have you studied how much information there was concerning nicotine and the dangers of smoking in published -- public scientific literature in the '70s?

A.   We have, and so did they.  They did the same thing internally.

Q.   Okay.  Have you done the same review in the '80s and in the '90s? A.   Correct.

Q.   Let's start in the '70s.  Who had more information on those topics?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Your Honor. MR. PAYNE:  Can I finish my question? MR. HARRISON:  Sorry. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q. Where did more of that information reside, in the internal secret industry documents or in published scientific public literature in the '70s?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Vague and speculative, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Well, as I mentioned, when we started doing the document research in preparation for the trial, we found things that we had never seen before.  And the biggest revelation was pH

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=179
1600

and pH manipulation, which the '88

Surgeon General's report has basically a page and a half on that whole topic in a report that is this thick (Indicating).  But there are reams of paper concerning pH and pH manipulation.  That's just one part of it.  They knew also things about the health effects and addiction as well.

BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Turn to page 7 of that document, please.

In this document, did they discuss research,

internal research into addiction? A.   They did.

Q.   And what did they write? A.   So what he says here, What we need to know,

above all things, is what constitutes the hold of

smoking; that is, to understand addiction.

Q.   Have you studied, have you looked at how much

effort went into understanding and studying addiction

on the side of the industry in the 1960s?

A.   Well, they were way ahead of all the rest of

us.  The first Surgeon General's on nicotine addiction

was not published until 1988.  So this is 20-plus years

before that.  So they were talking about addiction a

long time before anyone else was.

And the '64 Surgeon General's report was kind

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=180
1601

of the beginning of some of the reports. But the final one or the one that talked about nicotine addiction was not published until 20 years later.

Q.   Doctor, as a professional and as -- as a healthcare professional in the field of addiction, is it important to understand and study nicotine and to understand and study addiction?

A.   It is.

Q.   And were you -- were you working in the addiction treatment community in 1988 when the first Surgeon General's report came out on nicotine addiction?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.

Leading. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Were you working in the nicotine addiction treatment field in 1988?

A.   We were.  That's when we established the Nicotine Dependence Center.

Q.   At the Mayo Clinic in Rochester?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.  Did you have information and were you studying the state of science -- the state of the science of addiction at that time?

A.   We were.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=181
1602

Q.   Did you have a library where you -- that you kept to understand scientific journals and to understand what other doctors were doing?

A.   We did.

Q.   Okay.  And tell the jury briefly why, in 1988, that would have been important to you.

A.   Well, we needed to understand why it was so difficult for some people to stop smoking.  And to understand that, we had to understand the addiction part of it.  And there was also to begin to have a conversation about this is an addictive disorder and not just a matter of willpower or choice.  It really is an addictive disorder.

So that was the beginning of our understanding of that, was the Surgeon General's report of 1988.

We had the advantage of being in front of that a bit just because of our knowledge basis we acquired over the previous ten years.

Q.   Well, have you studied how much information and how much knowledge there was within the internal industry documents prior to 1988?  Have you studied that?

A.   Well, as I mentioned, in the JAMA article from 1998, we talked about what -- what was known in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=182
1603

the public literature and what was known in the internal documents as it relates to those topics that I mentioned, pH, nicotine addiction, and low tar/low nicotine cigarettes.  And what was in the public domain was trivial compared to what was in the internal documents.

Q.   Doctor, do you think, had you known what the industry knew in 1988, would that have had an effect on your care and treatment of your patients at the Mayo Clinic?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Speculation, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  Rephrase. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Doctor, would you have been able to treat your patients effectively -- more effectively had you had the information that the industry had prior to 1988 in their secret documents concerning nicotine and addiction?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Speculation, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Absolutely.  Ad the other part

to the equation is what the industry was doing in

the public domain to make this into a matter of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=183
1604

choice and all of those things, which basically

impeded our progress, a potential to make progress

in the treatment of this disorder.

So not only did we not have the knowledge

that they had internally, we had a proponent for

the opposite view of this being an addictive

disorder, which for the smoker allowed them to

rationalize and deny.

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.

Speculation, no connection to Mr. Rounds. THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Would you turn to page 10, please?  Would you read that paragraph to the jury, please?

A.   So we believe that we've found possible reasons for addiction in two other phenomena that accompany steady absorption of nicotine.  Experiments have so far only been carried out with rats, but with these it is found that certain rats become tolerant to repeated doses, and after a while show the usual nicotine reactions, but only on a very diminished scale.

Q.   Is this tolerance what you talked about earlier today?

A.   Correct.  And that's part of the addictive

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=184
1605

disorder or addictive nature of any drugs of dependence.

Q.   Do you know, as an addiction expert, whether what is written in this document was widely known in the treatment community at the time that the document was written?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Speculation, Your

Honor. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Do you know?

THE COURT:  Rephrase. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Do you know what was widely known in the addiction treatment community in the 1960s about tolerance?

A.   It was --

Q.   Have you studied that?

A.   We have.  And the tolerance that was talked about in the '60s and even the '70s and up until the '80s was tolerance of other drugs.  This speaks to the tolerance that we now know occurs in people who are tobacco dependent or nicotine dependent, which was well known to them way before it was in the rest of the community.

	And was this one of the documents that you

studie
	d when you first got access to the previously

secret
	internal documents of 1998?

A.
	I think that's correct.

	1963.

Q.
	And it is on which company's letterhead?

A.
	Brown & Williamson.


	MR. WICHMAN:  Okay.  Could we go down to �

an
	d highlight the bottom of the first page?

BY MR.
	WICHMAN:

Q.
	Would you read that the jury, please?

A.
	Nicotine is by far the most characteristic

single
	constituent in tobacco, and the known

physio
	logical effects are positively correlated with

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=186
1607

smoker response.

Q.   Okay.  Why is that --

Is that significant to your -- to an understanding of nicotine?

A.   It is.  And so it's just basically saying that nicotine is the driving force behind the smokers and the smoker response to continue to smoke.

Q.   Have you studied whether that was widely known in the public health community in the 1960s?

A.   It was not.

Q.   Doctor, would you turn to the next page, page 3?  This shows a chart, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Would you tell the jury what the chart -- why the chart is significant?

A.   Well, it's significant because it shows the nicotine level of the tobacco in their products.  So you can see for different ones, American is up here, Brown & Williamson is here.  So this gives the nicotine levels out to basically two decimal points.  So this is a pretty precise assessment of the nicotine levels in the different products in different companies and their brands.

Q.   Could you read the highlighted section underneath that?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=187
1608

A.   Certainly.

Our sales pattern during the period has been positively correlated with the nicotine level of the tobacco in our products.

Q.   So does the chart refer to sales patterns? Does the chart refer to sales patterns?

A.   The chart refers to nicotine levels, and then he's making the case that their sales patterns were related to the nicotine content.

Q.   Okay.  Would you look at the last sentence on this page, Doctor?

A.   Certainly.

The nicotine level of B&W, Brown & Williamson, cigarettes given in the above table was not obtained by accident.  It may be well to remind you, however, that we have a research program in progress to obtain, by genetic means, any level of nicotine desired.

And he goes on to talk about, I think that we can say, even now, that we can regulate fairly precisely the nicotine and sugar levels to almost any desired level management might require.

THE COURT:  All right.  And make sure, before you leave the exhibit, he gets a chance to read what he wants him to read.

MR. WICHMAN:  Yes.  It will be there. THE COURT:  We will accept that as Plaintiff's 7.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 7 admitted.) BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Doctor, does this document tell us whether

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

the industry had the ability to control nicotine levels as far back as 1962?

A.   They -- like they said, fairly precisely. And the numbers speaks to that.

Q.   Did they share this information, based on your research, with the public health community at that time?

A.   No.

Q.   Did they ever share that research with the Surgeon General prior to 1998?

A.   Not to my knowledge.

MR. WICHMAN:  You want it read?

MR. HARRISON:  Yes.  On page 1, paragraph 1,

the sentence starting, "I should emphasize in the

beginning."

THE WITNESS:  I should emphasize in the

beginning that everything to be included may

involve personal opinion more than scientific fact

and that I will no doubt raise more questions than

I will answer.  At any rate, you have my

permission to use any of the information herein

contained.

MR. HARRISON:  Thank you. BY MR. WICHMAN:

MR. HARRISON:  For the record.  Thank you.

THE COURT:  Okay.

(In open court.)

THE COURT:  I'm going to strike the last question.  Please disregard it. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Do you know who wrote this document, Doctor? A.   I believe this was from Mr. Addison Yeaman. Q.   Who was he at that time?

A.   He was general counsel for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.

Q.   At that time, was Brown & Williamson part of or separate from R.J. Reynolds?

A.   They were separate from R.J. Reynolds.

Q.   Do you know if Addison Yeaman shared that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=192
1613

document with the Council for Tobacco Research?

A.   That was one the intents that's written in the document, that they planned to do that, yes.

Q.   So did they distribute it to the Council for Tobacco Research?

A.   As best I know, yes.

Q.   Okay.  Was this document -- did he also circulate this document to Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company?

Yes.

Okay.

That's where he worked.

All right.  Did he also circulate it to

A

Q

A

Q BATCo?

A.   This is -- this is a document having to do with the research being done at Battelle, which is in the UK.  So it was within the domain of BAT, yes.

Q.   I just want to establish that it was distributed by Dr. Yeaman outside of those two organizations to another entity, and that entity was the Council for Tobacco Research, correct?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Leading, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  That's what he says in the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=193
1614

document, actually.  So --BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   All right.  In this document, what were they researching?

A.   Well, they were researching all kinds of different things.  Mainly about nicotine and some of the effects nicotine has.  And he goes into expressing some of the concerns about the smoking and health issues.  So it's a fairly wide-ranging document written by a lawyer.

MR. WICHMANN:  We would offer into evidence,

PT3615, Your Honor.

MR. HARRISON:  Subject to our previous

objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Overruled.  That will

be accepted as Plaintiff's No. 8.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 8 admitted.) BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Strictly private and confidential, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.  And when was this document written?

A.   1963.

MR. WICHMANN:  Could you go to page 4,

please, Dan? BY MR. WICHMAN:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=194
1615

Q.   What did the company write about nicotine?

A.   Well, this is Mr. Yeaman saying, Moreover, nicotine is addictive.  We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug, effective in the release of stress mechanisms.  But cigarettes, we will assume the Surgeon General's committee to say, despite the beneficent effect of nicotine, have certain unattractive side effects.  They cause or predispose to lung cancer, they contribute to certain cardiovascular disorders, they may well be truly causative in emphysema, etc., etc.

Q.   Was that information, based on your research, widely known at that time in the public health community?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.

Speculation.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   If you know.  If you know.

A.   It was not.  And it was not known, as far as I know, to -- was not provided to the Surgeon General's committee either.  In fact, there was another document that said we will not do that, from Mr. Yeaman, and it was circulated amongst the other people at both BAT and Brown & Williamson.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=195
1616

Q.   Is it important to circulate information concerning products to the Surgeon General if it has to do with health?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor.

Speculation.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Okay.  Have you done research at the Mayo Clinic that people that work for you, done research at the Mayo Clinic into health, and forwarded that information to the Surgeon General?

A.   As far as I know, back in those days, I don't know.

Q.   Okay.  What does the document say, the last sentence, Doctor?

A.   The last sentence in this one?

Q.   In this -- on this page.

A.   So he's talking about the certain unattractive side effects that the Surgeon General's committee may be talking about.  They may well be truly causative in emphysema, etc., etc.

Q.   Well, could you read to the jury, starting with "in the meantime"?

A.   In the meantime, we say, here is our triple or quadruple -- our quadruple filter capable of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=196
1617

resolving whatever constituent of smoke is currently suspect, while delivering full flavor, and, incidentally, a nice jolt of nicotine.  And if we are the first to be able to make a -- and sustain that claim, what price Kent?

Q.   What is the significance of that in terms of the history of smoking and health?

A.   Well, they are talking about here is the Griffith filter, which was a new filter device that they were testing to see if it would remove some of the bad things, while still allowing the nicotine impact to occur.  Because back in the 1960s, Kent had staked out the territory of having a healthier cigarette.  So that's what he's talking about, "what price Kent."  If they could position themselves with a, quote, safer cigarettes, then maybe they could overcome what Kent had done in the market.

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, I would like to switch gears a bit here and ask you, was Reynolds studying nicotine satisfaction in the '60s and '70s?

A.   Yes.

Q.   For the nonsmokers on the jury, I think you discussed some of this before, but would you tell us in simple terms what nicotine satisfaction is?

A.   Well, they use the terms "nicotine

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=197
1618

satisfaction, "and from an addiction standpoint, our interpretation of that is it's kind of a euphemism for the kick of nicotine or the hit of nicotine which produces the pleasurable response with the release of Dopamine.  That's kind of the physiological part of it

So they use terms like "satisfaction," "impact," "kick," "hit."  And those are all kind of in the same bailiwick.  So they talk about satisfaction from the mouth as far as what feelings may be in the mouth.  But the real satisfaction comes from the nicotine getting into the lungs and going straight to the central nervous system in the brain.  That's what we interpret "satisfaction" to mean.

MR. WICHMAN:  Would you � 1553, please,

PT1553. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   I will show you this document dated July 18th, 1973.  Have you seen this document before coming today?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It says -- what does it say regarding RJR?

A.   Well, it's a secret document from -- to Mr. Blevins, who is in marketing research.

Q.   And who authored it?

A.   I think it was Teague.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=198
1619

Q.   So the chemist who did the marketing research?

A.   Correct.

Q. Now, was this document -- did you come across this document in May of 1998, when you first looked at the internal industry documents?

A.   It was probably in the '96 or '97 range.

Q.   Could you read the first paragraph and tell us what it says?

A.   So it says, Because it relates to our recently enhanced awareness of the role of nicotine pH, etc., in selling cigarettes, it may be of interest to you at this time.

It's talking about the full nicotine satisfaction but with reduced tar.

Q.   Would you look -- would you please read to the jury the last sentence?

A.   Hope this may be of use to you as we look at the best ways to exploit nicotine satisfaction.

Q.   What is the significance of this document?

A.   Well, it's talking about pH in nicotine, nicotine pH, which we've talked about before.  The higher the pH, it's more base.  The higher the pH, the more percentage of free nicotine is available.

Q.   Okay.  Have you studied -- you've studied

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=199
1620

this whole phenomenon of nicotine and pH in your career, correct?

A

Q 1980s? A Q

Correct.

Did you know what is in this document in the

No.

Did you know what is in this document in the 19- � in the 1990s before 1996?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  No.  As I mentioned earlier, the '88 Surgeon General's report had basically a page and a half on pH and pH manipulation, and it's more on smokeless tobacco, cigars, and the pipe tobacco and very little on the cigarettes. So this is -- this is one of the big revelations to those of us in the arena that came about as a result of the Minnesota tobacco trial. BY MR. WICHMAN:

Q.   Why was it a big revelation? A.   Because there was very little of this knowledge in the public domain compared to what they had in the industry.

Q.   Was it important knowledge?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=200
1621

A.   Oh, absolutely.  It was -- it was a revelation that really set a new tone for how we deal with this, because we knew we were dealing with a very efficient delivery device called a cigarette, but we had no idea that they were freebasing the nicotine to the extent that they were.

Q.   Thank you.

MR. WICHMANN:  I would offer 1553 into

evidence, please.

MR. HARRISON:  No objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  That will be accepted

as Plaintiff's 9.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 9 admitted.) MR. WICHMANN:  Dan, would you please put up

PT3589?  I'm sorry, 3569. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Are you familiar with this document, Doctor?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Is this another one of the secret internal documents?

A.   It is.

Q.   Okay.  Would you tell the jury what this document -- why this document is significant?

A.   Well, Winston was the main cigarette from Reynolds that was introduced in 1954, and it was

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=201
1622

basically the leading cigarette sales above all.

And then Marlboro began to creep up and have increasing sales in the market share, so this was an attempt to figure out what was happening with Marlboro and what was happening with Winston with regard to smoke pH and the sales trends.  So, basically, it was being introduced to see if they could see figure out why Marlboro was taking away the market share.

MR. WICHMANN:  Could you highlight the last paragraph on that page, please?

THE WITNESS:  So it says the results of these studies show that there is a very strong positive correlation between smoke pH and sales trends over the years studied.  A high pH smoke is strong due to a high concentration of unbound, or free, nicotine in the smoke. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  And the last sentence on that page, please.

A.   It goes on to say, Correlation of these values with sales trends were made, and the results showed that even stronger positive correlations than were found for smoke pH sales trends -- and that has to do with the free nicotine, or unbound nicotine.  So the correlation was strong for pH, but it was really the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=202
1623

strongest for free nicotine.  So we're talking about free nicotine being more available for absorption and more rapid absorption.

Q.   And could you tell us in simple terms what that, based on the Reynolds document, had to do with the sales?

A.   With the?

Q.   With the sales.

A.   It did.  So they -- they were looking at the different brands.  And Winston pH values and free nicotine values were pretty static, whereas Marlboro was going up, and, therefore, the sales was related to higher pH but also more strongly related to higher levels of free nicotine.

Q.   Could you call your attention to page 4 please?  Could you read that to the jury, please?

A.   So they did an analysis of total nitrogen, total sugar and ammonia analyses, and so total nitrogen reflects both ammonia but also urea and other nitrogens.  It says, The available analytical results from competitive brand analyses for total nitrogen, total sugar and ammonia in Winston, Marlboro, Salem, and Kool are shown in Table 11.

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.  Bring up the table,

please, Dan.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=203
1624

THE WITNESS:  Or table 2, I guess. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Table 2, yes.  What does that show in simple terms?

A.   It shows the analysis they did in sugar. When you add sugar to the tobacco, it can reduce the pH.  So Winston is over here on this side, and Salem is here, Marlboro is here.  And then you see in 1964, total nitrogen was here for that, and then by the --whatever that date is down there, '68, and then ammonia -- the percentage of ammonia is going up.  And no ammonia is present in tobacco.  It was basically not measurable earlier.  And then Marlboro began to have more ammonia in the tobacco products compared to Winstons.

Q.   And why, Doctor, is ammonia and nitrogen --are they important?

A.   Well, ammonia is important because it raises the pH and other nitrogenous compounds, like urea can also raise the pH.  And if you raise the pH, you add more free nicotine.

MR. WICHMANN:  Plaintiff would move PT3569

into evidence.

objection, no further objections.

MR. WICHMANN:  Dan, PT1233, please. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Would you tell the jury who Frank Colby was? A.   Frank Colby was an -- organic chemist who managed information group within Reynolds.

Q.   This was an R.J. Reynolds internal document? A.   Correct.

Q.   And was this document available to the American public, to your knowledge, prior to December of 1973?

A.   No.

MR. HARRISON:  Your Honor, may we approach for one moment?

THE COURT:  Come on up.

(At the bench)

MR. HARRISON:  Your Honor, I object to Mr. Wichmann's repetitive use of "is this a secret," "was it previously available," "did it come out in '98."  He's already established that all these came out as a result of 1998.  There is already a finding.  All this is designed to do is

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=205
1626

inflame the jury to a point that is already established.  I object.  It's repetitive questioning as to each document being introduced.

MR. WICHMANN:  Here is my response, Judge. Ms. Parker -- I don't know whether it was intentionally or unintentionally, in opening told the jury, Mr. Wichmann said these were all previous secret documents, but if you go on the Internet now, they're available to everybody in the world.  And I don't want to confuse the jury.

THE COURT:  All right.  But when you ask the question, you're asking -- you're asking it improperly.  So instead of asking it improperly, why not indicate that this is one of the documents that became available in 1996, '97 or '98 --

MR. WICHMANN:  Right.

THE COURT:  -- instead of asking it the way you've been asking it.

MR. WICHMANN:  All right.  Fine.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. HARRISON:  Thank you, Your Honor. (In open court) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Going back to PT1233, Doctor.  Is this one of the documents that became publicly available in May of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=206
1627

1998?

A.   It is.

Q.   Okay.  Let me call your attention to the middle paragraph there, "my suggestion."  Would you please read that to the jury?

A.   My suggestion covers all these conditions. It's basically to go back as much as possible, probably at least halfway, towards the old filter cigarettes, i.e., the cigarettes of the 1950s.

Q.   And then the highlighted portion below.

A.   So they delivered more enjoyment or more kicks of nicotine, and other things as well.

Q.   What is the significance of that language, sir?

A.   Well, they were concerned, again, about sales, and he's trying to figure out how to recommend to people in both marketing and research how to -- how to increase sales by increasing the nicotine, quote, kick, which is the hit of nicotine to the brain.

MR. WICHMANN:  Could you highlight the bottom

paragraph, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Please read that to the jury.

A.   As far as tar and nicotine in the smoke are concerned, I believe it should be possible to achieve

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=207
1628

the desired effect by going to a tar level of today's Pall Mall, non-filtered type, of about 29 milligrams tar and 1.8 milligrams nicotine.  Still, with any old-style filter, any desired additional nicotine kick, quote, unquote, could be easily obtained through pH regulation.

MR. WICHMANN:  Plaintiff would offer PT1233 into evidence, Your Honor.

MR. HARRISON:  Subject to our previous objections, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Overruled.  That will be accepted as Plaintiff's 11.

MR. WICHMANN:  I think I'll object.  I think she needs --

THE WITNESS:  I don't talk to them unless I have to.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. PARKER:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  All right.  Very good.  All right.  Doctor, go ahead and have a seat.

Would you put up 3291, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Was this document available prior to May of 1998?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=210
1631

A.   No, it was not.

Q.   And who authored this document?

A.   Dr. Teague.  Claude Teague.

Q.   Okay.  And in a nutshell, what does this document pertain to?  What is the significance of this document?

A.   Well, the title pretty well says it all. Implications and activities arising from the correlation of smoke pH with nicotine impact, close quote, smoke qualities, and cigarette sales.  It's all about sales; it's all about money.

Q.   Okay.  So is this more of the same that we have already gone over?

A.   It is.

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.  Your Honor, plaintiff

would move into evidence PT3291.

MR. HARRISON:  Object, Your Honor.

Cumulative.

THE COURT:  All right.  Overruled.  We'll

accept it as Plaintiff's 12.

Q.   Now, would you put up 1834, please?  Have you seen this document before today?

A.   I have.

Q.   And was this document available prior to May of 1998?

A.   It was not.

Q.   At some point in time did R.J. Reynolds catch up to Marlboro in terms of sales?

A.   It did.  Well, not in terms of sales but in terms of pH and free nicotine.

Q.   And would you explain what the significance of this document is?

A.   Well, the previous document from the early 1970s showed that sales for Winston had gone down as the sales for Marlboro had gone up, and that was correlated with both pH going up in Marlboro and free nicotine going up in Marlboro and staying pretty much static in Winston.  And so the effort was made within Reynolds to increase the pH and increase the free nicotine to basically catch up with Marlboro.  And that's what this document is all about.

MR. WICHMANN:  Could you put up page 8,

please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Would you just read the beginning of the second paragraph quickly for the jury?

A.   So PM's, or Philip Morris, experience in nicotine technology dates back to the pre-1968.  We

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=212
1633

expect Philip Morris' development of nicotine technology has been closely correlated with its findings from behavorial and consumer perception studies.

Q.   Well, actually, I meant the next paragraph. I'm sorry.

A.   I'm sorry.

Admittedly, RJR R&D, research and development, have been playing, quote, catch up, end quote, in this nicotine technology area.  If the Winston B is any indication we have, quote, caught up to the currently-used Philip Morris system.

Q.   That's enough.

A.   Okay.

Q.   And this is authored by whom?

A.   Alan Rodgman.

Q.   He was a?

A.   He was a chemist in the -- in -- at Reynolds. And this memo actually went -- was going to Mr. Horrigan, who was the CEO and president of Reynolds, so it was an explanation of this going to the very top of their organization.

MR. WICHMANN:  Plaintiff would offer into

evidence PT1834.

MR. HARRISON:  No objection, Your Honor.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 13 admitted.) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Are you familiar with the Nordine -- Nordine study?

A.   Yes.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you please put up 1820,

Dan? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Please tell the jury who Dr. DiMarco was?

A.   He was the director for research.  He was a high level researcher at Reynolds.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you go back to the first

page, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q. And what did Reynolds say in that document about their study?

A.   So they are talking about the market for cigarettes.  And about one third of the overall population is in that market at any given time.  Most of those who have smoked for any significant time would like to stop, but many -- many but not most of those who would like to stop smoking are able to do so.

Q. Was this widely known in the public health community?

A.   Well, it was known to some degree.  I think we showed one of the graphs we showed earlier.  We knew that there were a large number of people who wanted to stop smoking, and the chances of stopping smoking was not very high.  This just is something that they used internally to basically document that.

Q.   Would you turn to page 2, please?

Would you read the highlighted portions to the jury, please?

A. We should be able to maintain/increase the size of the totals market by influencing entry/exit rates .

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=215
1636

Q.   Do you know from a smoking and health perspective or a historical perspective what is meant by entry and exit rates?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor. Meaning and intent of the document.  The document speaks for itself.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Well, this entry has to do with beginning smokers, and they sometimes call them replacement smokers.  And, basically, it focuses on young people, to get them into the smoking market.  And then the influence and the exit rates would be influencing the rate at which people stop smoking who are already smokers, so that's what they meant by entry and exit. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   All right.  Would you read the highlighted second paragraph, please?

A.   However, we cannot ever be comfortable selling a product which most of our customers would stop using if they could; that is to say, if the exit gate from our market should suddenly open, we could be out of business almost overnight.

Q.   Lower in that, on that page, would you please read this to the jury?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=216
1637

A.   If when that occurs our option includes go out of business, find a way to eliminate the desire of smokers to stop smoking.

Q.   And then page 3, please.  I think we just --in the interest of time, if you could read just the last sentence please.

A.   There are some long-term high risk/cost things that we need to address because, to repeat, we cannot be comfortable marketing a product which most of our customers would do without if they could.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, plaintiff would offer PT1820 into evidence.

MR. HARRISON:  No objection, but before we move on, I have a rule of completeness, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Why don't you point out what you would like him to read.

MR. HARRISON: If you go back to page 2 where it has "our options include," can you read the No. 3?  Yes, the No. 3, the not highlighted one.

THE WITNESS:  Provide other products away from conventional cigarettes which meet the same need cigarettes now meet but without the associated negatives.

MR. HARRISON:  Thank you.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 14 admitted.) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   That was written in 1982?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Have they done that?

A.   No.  The most recent thing has to do with electronic cigarettes, which are not efficient delivery devices as conventional cigarettes.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you put up 2770, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Have you seen this document before today?

A.   I have.

Q.   And was this document available to the public prior to May of 1996?

A.   No.

Q.   And do you know who if -- can you tell the jury who it's to and who it's from?

A.   Well, they were -- they were both marketing people.  I think this was at Brown & Williamson.  They were marketing type people.

Q.   Okay.  And what --

MR. WICHMANN:  Could you enlarge the

highlighted portions?

THE WITNESS:  So it's talking about attitudes

of smokers and consumers.  Very few consumers are

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=218
1639

aware of the effects of nicotine, i.e., its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison.

MR. WICHMANN:  Plaintiff would offer PT2077 into evidence Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. HARRISON:  No objection Your Honor. THE COURT:  All right.  That will be accepted as Plaintiff's 15.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 15 admitted.) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay, Doctor.  Let's switch gears here.  And could you show the next demonstrative?  We're up to 1978 to the '80s.  Could you tell the jury who these two people are?

A.   The one on the left is Doctor C. Everett Koop who was appointed by President Reagan to be the new Surgeon General.

Q.   And do you know approximately when that was? A.   I can't remember.

Q.   Who authored the first Surgeon General's report on nicotine addiction?

A.   It was under Dr. Koop's administration.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you put up 3828, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   What did this Surgeon General's report focus

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=219
1640

on?

A.   It focused on nicotine addiction.  And previous Surgeon General reports, as the title says, Health Consequences of Smoking, had been talking about the diseases and other things.  So this is the first one that really focused solely on nicotine addiction.

Q.   Was it significant?

A.   It was.  It was a seminal moment for those of us in the field of tobacco dependence, because it was the first time that these -- the data had been compiled in one place focusing only on nicotine addiction.

Q.   Doctor, did that report contain major conclusions?

A.   It did.

Q.   Would you turn to page 28, please?

Would you read to the jury what the 1988 Surgeon General's reports major conclusions were?

A.   Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting.  Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addictions.  The pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs, such as heroin and cocaine.

Q.   Is that still established science today?

A.   Even more so.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=220
1641

Q.   Did this report discuss the first Surgeon General's report concerning smoking and health that came out in 1964?

A.   It did.

Q.   And why was that -- was that important?

A.   It was important because the '64 Surgeon General's report concluded that nicotine in tobacco products were habituating and were not addicting.

Q.   And explain to the jury the difference between the two.

A.   Well, the criteria that were used at that time were changed, actually, later on that year by the World Health Organization.  And this report, the '88 report, talks about the differences in definitions, and so on, and noted that had they used the same classification system for addicting drugs, that neither cocaine nor amphetamines would have been classified as addicting drugs.

Q.   When?

In 1964.

Was there more you wanted to add?

Pardon?

Was there more you wanted to add to your

A

Q

A

Q

answer? A.

No.  That's basically it

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=221
1642

Q.   All right.

A.   So, basically, it shows that the definition that was used back in '64 was one that became outdated very quickly, and it really took us, then, 24 years before someone really documented conclusively the addictive nature of nicotine we're talking about. MR. WICHMANN:  Plaintiff would offer into evidence PT3828, Your Honor.  So, Your Honor, for the record, we're putting in the cover sheet and this page only, which has to do with the major conclusions.  But Mr. Smith needs to print just that page, and then we'll add it to the exhibit. But, you know, the report itself is 1,000 pages. We're not going to do that.  With Your Honor's permission, we will bring the copied second page, run it by opposing counsel, and then add it. MR. HARRISON:  No objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  All right.  We'll take it as described as Plaintiff's Exhibit 16.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 16 admitted.) MR. WICHMANN:  Thank you. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, did the cigarette industry respond to this 1988 Surgeon General's report that concerned nicotine addictions?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=222
1643

A.   They did.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you put up 251OB,

please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Just for the purposes of this exhibit, because Dr. Cummings is coming next week to talk more about The Tobacco Institute, but could you just briefly tell the jury what The Tobacco Institute was?

A.   The Tobacco Institute was a group of -- that was the main lobbying group for the tobacco industry as a whole and was supported financially by the individual cigarette companies.  So that's their main -- their lobbying and public voice, if you will, for the whole industry.

Q.   And what did they write in response to the Surgeon General's report?

A.   Well, they kind of shook it down:  Claims that cigarettes are addictive contradict common sense. MR. WICHMANN:  The last paragraph please,

Dan.  The next highlighted paragraph, I should

say.  There you go. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Read that to the jury.

A.   The report trivializes the serious drug problem faced by society.  The claim that cigarette

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=223
1644

smoke is a drug addiction similar to cocaine or heroin use or alcohol abuse is unfortunate and unwarranted. The message to the American public is that using illegal drugs such as crack or heroin has the same risk of addiction as smoking.

Q.   And the last sentence, please.  They deny that smokers can could be addicts?

A.   Correct.  They claimed -- the claims that smokers are, quote, addicts, end quote, defy common sense and contradict the fact that people quit smoking every day.

MR. WICHMANN:  We would offer into evidence PT2510B, please.

MR. HARRISON:  No objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  All right.  That will be accepted as Plaintiff's 17.

MR. WICHMANN:  Thank you. (Plaintiff's Exhibit 17 admitted.) BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, was there another Surgeon General's report in 1989?

A.   There was.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you please put up 3829, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=224
1645

Q.   This talked about reducing the health consequences of smoking, correct?

A.   Correct.

MR. WICHMANN:  I would like to turn to the

executive summary on page 9, please.  Would you

call up the very last sentence, please?  Take it

the other way. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Did the Surgeon General in 1989 address the issue of whether smoking was a matter of free choice?

A.   Well, it did.  The sentence before that it was talking about tobacco are addicting, and nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction.  These two factors refute the argument that smoking is a matter of free choice.  Most smokers start smoking as teenagers and then become addicted.

Q.   Okay.  Please continue.  Yeah.  We'll go over to the next.

A.   By the time smokers become adults when they would be expected to have greater appreciation of the health effects of smoking, many have difficulty quitting.

Q.   Please continue reading.

A.   Today 80 percent of smokers say they would like to quit, two-thirds of smokers have made at least

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=225
1646

one serious attempt to quit.  Characteristically people quit smoking several times before becoming permanent ex-smokers.

Q.   Was that the state of science in 1988?

A.   1989, yes.

MR. WICHMANN:  In 1989.  I'm sorry.  Okay. Would you go on down that second page of it,

please, to the -- I'm sorry.  I stand corrected.

Go back to the previous page. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Could you read the highlighted portion starting with research has shown?

A.   Research has shown that one fourth or more of all regular cigarette smokers die of smoking-related diseases.  If 20 million of the 70 million children now living in the United States smoked cigarettes's adults, about 29 percent, then at least 5 million of them will die of smoking-related diseases.  This figure should alarm anyone who is concerned with the future of today's children.

Q.   Did it, in the next paragraph, address --

A.   Two additional factors make smoking among young people a pre-eminent public health concern:  One, the issue of initiation of smoking and, two, nicotine addiction.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=226
1647

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you go down, please, and highlight one section?  Right there. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Please read for the jury beginning with "among smokers."

A.   Among smokers half answered "definitely not" or "probably not."  This response suggests that many children, adolescents are unaware or underestimate the addictive nature of smoking.

So the question was, What would you say is the possibility that five years from now you will be a cigarette smoker?

Q.   Was C. Everett Koop the Surgeon General in 1989 also?

A.   He was.

MR. WICHMANN:  Plaintiff would offer into evidence PT3829, which consists of the cover page and only the two pages that we have just gone over, Your Honor.

MR. HARRISON:  Subject to previous objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.  We'll accept those pages as Plaintiff's 18.

Q.   Okay.  Would you please -- plaintiff would offer that video into evidence, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. HARRISON:  Subject to previous objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  That would be overruled, and that will be Plaintiff's No. 19. MR. WICHMANN:  Thank you, Your Honor. (Plaintiff's Exhibit 19 admitted.) MR. WICHMANN:  Mr. Smith, would you put up PT3895, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, are you familiar with the 2010 Surgeon General's report? A.   I am.

Q.   Okay.  Would you tell the jury what the title of it is?

A.   Well, it's about the biology and other things having to do with smoking-related diseases, how tobacco smoke causes disease.

Q.   I would ask you to read the major conclusions.  Could you turn to page 0202, please? Read the highlighted portion for the jury please.

A.   Nicotine is the key chemical compound that causes and sustains the powerful addicting effects of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=230
1651

commercial tobacco products.  The powerful addicting effects of commercial tobacco products are mediated by diverse actions of nicotine and multiple types of nicotinic receptors in the brain.

Q.   Doctor, is that the summarized testimony that you gave earlier today about the brain and nicotinic receptors?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Bolstering, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  It does.  And this basically is just a progression of the science, learning about the receptors and other things.  This is just an updated version, so the science continues to evolve over time.

MR. WICHMANN:  Plaintiff would offer into evidence PT3895, Your Honor.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 20 admitted.) MR. WICHMANN:  All right.  And, again, my

side will supplement it with the second page.

Thank you, Your Honor. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, moving right along, are you familiar with the 2014 Surgeon General's report?

A.   I am.

MR. WICHMANN:  And would you put up PTSG2014,

please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   What is the significance of that report?

A.   Well, this is an update 50 years from the first Surgeon General report of 1964 and basically kind of summarizing what's happened in the progress we have made or the progress we haven't made.

MR. WICHMANN:  I would just ask you to put up

the major conclusions, which is at page 37. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Would you please read major conclusion No. 1?

A.   The century-long epidemic of cigarette smoking has caused an enormous avoidable public health tragedy.  Since the first Surgeon General's report in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=232
1653

1964, more than 20 million premature deaths can be attributed to cigarette smoking.

Q.   Please read the second major conclusion. A.   Number 2, the tobacco epidemic was initiated and has been sustained by the aggressive strategies of the tobacco industry, which has deliberately misled the public on the risk of smoking cigarettes.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, the plaintiff would offer into evidence PTSG2014 and the cover sheet and page 37 only.

MR. HARRISON:  Subject to previous objections, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Overruled.  That will be accepted as Plaintiff's 21.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 21 admitted.) MR. WICHMANN:  We'll have to copy both pages and get that to you.  Thank you, Your Honor.

If you could put up PT2184, please.  Further back, please. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Have you seen this document before, Doctor?

I have.

And what is the date on that document?

1980.

And who is the document to and who is the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=233
1654

document from?

A.   These are two executives at The Tobacco Institute.  One is the director for communications, and one is in public relations.

Q.   Was this document publically available before May of 1998?

A.   It was not.

Q.   Would you please, on the second paqe, Doctor, read us the last sentence?

A.   We can't defend continued smokinq as, quote, free choice, end quote, if the person was, quote, addicted, period, end quote.

MR. WICHMANN:  The plaintiff would offer PT2184, the redacted version as evidence, Your Honor.

MR. HARRISON:  Subject to previous objections, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All riqht.  Overruled.  That will be accepted as plaintiff's 22.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 22 admitted.) MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, may I approach? (At the bench.)

MR. WICHMANN:  So that the record is clear, we're offerinq in the non-redacted portion with the stipulation that my team will redact the paper

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

piece and get the proper document into evidence before it goes back.

MR. HARRISON:  I would prefer that we bring the document when it's ready, so there is no confusion.

MR. WICHMANN:  Whichever way Your Honor prefers.

THE COURT:  Okay.  This is one that needs to be redacted?

MR. WICHMANN:  It needs to be redacted before it goes back.  What he did is he redacted the one on screen for the purposes of the witness.  But that doesn't matter to us.  I'm trying to make it �

THE COURT:  All right.  Get it redacted before Tuesday.

MR. WICHMANN:  Yes.

THE COURT:  All right.  Okay.

MR. WICHMANN:  We will put the blank envelope in this?

THE COURT:  If you want to make a record when you replace the redacted one in there on Tuesday, we can do that before we get started.

MR. WICHMANN:  Okay.  Fine.

MR. HARRISON:  Perfect.  Fine.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, one more issue?

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. WICHMANN:  I have one more document to talk about before I finish with Dr. Hurt.  The one more document is -- you are happy, everybody wants to go home on Friday -- but the one document is the Structured Creativity document that we talked about yesterday where Your Honor asked me to lay the foundation for the document.  It's the "bigger bags of money" document.  And I don't think the jury needs to be here.

THE COURT:  You mean it's the Dorian Gray document?

MR. WICHMANN:  Correct.  Correct.  I don't think the jury needs to be here for that.  So I want to make sure that Dr. Hurt and the Reynolds folks make that plain.  So I don't know, I'll leave that up to Your Honor, how you want handle that.  Either we can --

THE COURT:  As long as you don't publish anything that's on there before you set up the foundation, I don't care for you doing that in front of the jury.

MR. HARRISON:  Your Honor, I'm going to have some cross-questions on foundation, because Dr.

	VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

BY MR. WICHMANN:
	
Q.   Dr.
	Hurt, have you seen this document before

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=237
1658

today?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was this document publicly available prior to May of 1996?

A.   It was not.

Q.   And would you tell the judge briefly how it was that you came to be aware of this document?

A.   Well, two things.  One, we saw the printed version of it during the course of some research we did.  But then there's an audio tape of the conversations that went on, which we discovered at this Guildford Depository in the UK, which is not necessarily reflected in what they wrote here.  So it's kind of two sources.

Q.   So have you heard, have you heard the video tape and studied the documents?

A.   It's an audio tape, and I studied the documents, yes.

Q.   Would you tell the Court what the relationship was between British American Tobacco Company and R.J. Reynolds in June of 1984?

A.   Well, it was the relationship -- this relationship had to do with British American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson in '84, which Reynolds wasn't present at this meeting.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=238
1659

Q.   Well, when did Reynolds acquire -- Reynolds acquired Brown & Williamson, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And Reynolds is now responsible, and they've admitted in this case that they are, for Brown & Williamson, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q. Brown & Williamson, before Reynolds acquired it, had a relationship between Brown & Williamson and BATCo?

A.   Correct.  So as I mentioned earlier, they shared research, they shared research resources to devote to this, and they also had meetings like this where members of both companies were present.

Q.   Those two companies being?

A.   BAT and Brown & Williamson.

Q.   Was this document created for use at a conference related to new product development?

A.   Correct.  And that's why it's called Structured Creativity.  They wanted to explore different ways that they could figure out how to make products entering into markets that they had not entered into, such as the Middle East and Africa.  They talk about that in the audio tape more than they do, actually, in the paper version.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=239
1660

Q.   Do you know if representatives of Brown & Williamson were present at the conference?

A.   There was at least one there, as I remember. MR. WICHMANN:  Would you put up that, please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   And in your historical research, have you found who Ted Parrack is?

A.   I don't recall off the top of my head who he is .

Q.   But he's listed as a representative of Brown & Williamson?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Brown & Williamson USA?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.  Do you know whether or not information was shared back and forth at this conference between BATCo and Brown & Williamson?

A.   It was, because both groups were present at the conference, and there was a report that was generated.

MR. WICHMANN:  Now, would you put up, please,

1412-047? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Were the participants discussing cigarette, cigarettes and nicotine and the brain at the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=240
1661

conference?

A.   They were.

Q.   Alrighty.  I think we see it up there, Your Honor.

Were they also discussing the dosage of nicotine at that conference?

A.   They did.

Q.   And to the best of your knowledge, or do you know if the Brown & Williamson representative was there?

A.   As far as I know.  He was listed as an attendee.

Q.   Okay.  Page 48, please.  Do they also discuss something else?  The future?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what did they say, just briefly?

A.   Have an emerging picture of a fast, highly pharmacologically effective and cheap, quote, drug, end quote, tobacco, which confers flavor and manual and oral satisfaction to the user.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, I think we have

already gone over the Dorian Gray quote.  But I

wanted to call these others to Your Honor's

attention.

And the plaintiff would want to offer into

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=241
1662

evidence 2014, the structured creativity document, the cover sheet, the one, two, two pages that we've -- we're offering here on the issue of the sharing of information between companies, including Brown & Williamson, on nicotine and marketing, and also the page that has the Dorian Gray and the bigger bags of money on the grounds that that will come in as rebuttal to Ms. Parker's opening statement where she said that Janice Rounds is only here to get money.

THE COURT:  All right.  Do you want to voir dire?

MR. HARRISON:  I do, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Go ahead.

VOIR DIRE EXAMINATION

BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Hurt.

A.   Hi.

Q.   We have met before, correct?

A.   I think so.

Q.   I think you started off, or you acknowledged

to us, you don't know who Ted Parrack is, correct? A.   I don't recall, no. Q.   I think at one point you said he was an

attendee, but I think what --

	Can have the Elmo, please?
		


	
	I think the document you
	showed us, the
	order

of
	presenters, correct?
		
	


	A.
	Right.
	
	


	Q.
	So this document does no
	t say that Ted
	

Parrack
		attended the presentation
	given by Colin
	Greig,

correct?
		
	
	


	A.
	No.  But the audio tape
	has all of them
	in

it.
	It'
	s an amazing audio tape.
	If you have never
	
heard it
		, you ought to listen to
	it.  It tells more
	
about wh
		at went on in this meetin
	g than any of the
	
pap
	er versions do.
		
	


	
	MR. HARRISON:  I would object under the
		best


	evidence rule, Your Honor.
		
	

BY
	MR. WICHMANN:
		
	


	Q.
	But moving, moving back.
	
	


	
	So there were eight presentations given
		at

the
	conf A.
	erence in South Hampton, Correct.
	correct?
	


	Q.
	Let me ask you, how many
	days did the
	

con
	ference last?
		
	


	A.
	I don't recall.
	
	


	Q.
	If we look at the cover,
	the conference
	goes

from the
		25th to the 28th of June
	, 1984, correct?
	

	A.
	That's what it says.
	
	

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=243
1664

Q.   Do you know if the eight presentations listed in the presentation were even given on the same day?

A.   I don't know that I have that in my memory. I could go back and listen to the audio tape, which would be the entire conference, and identify the participants that way.  But I didn't do that.

Q.   And the Ted Parrack presentation was the first presentation and the Colin Greig was the last presentation, correct?

A.   It's listed that way.  We don't know exactly what the order was.

Q.   So you can't tell us today in what order the presentations were given?

A.   No.  I don't think it necessarily went by the way that's listed here or not.  It could have gone either way.

Q.   And to be clear, Colin Greig is an employee of British American Tobacco Company, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And at the time he was speaking at the conference, he was speaking on behalf of British American Tobacco Company, correct?

A.   Well, but you can't separate the two.  They were joined at the hip, both in research and marketing, as well as the things that they did to support their

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=244
1665

research.

Q.   Okay.  And, Dr. Hurt, you cannot say that any presenter on the list at the conference gathered any information from the presentations given by other presenters at the conference, correct?

A.   That's a very long question.  Can you break it down into something more simple?

Q.   You can't say, for example, that Ted Parrack was at and obtained any information from the Colin Greig presentation, correct, sir?

A.   I can't say one way or the other.  But if you listen to the audio tape, they were in a room, there was all of them were in a room throughout the entire --entire time.  So what's reflected in the paper version of this is not exactly what went on in the meeting, according to their voices, not what they wrote. MR. HARRISON:  Okay.  I move to strike

everything after "I can't say one way or the

other."

And with that, Your Honor, I have no further

questions.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'll deny your motion

to strike.

Any objection to that coming into evidence? MR. HARRISON:  There is, Your Honor.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=245
1666

THE COURT:  What is it?

MR. HARRISON:  The evidence is, is that to the extent that Dr. Hurt was here to provide a basis for the statement, his last answer says, I can't tell you one way the other whether Ted Parrack, who is the only person who is alleged to have been at the conference, obtained any information from Colin Greig, which is the only exception for this to be coming in on.

The conference is four days long.  Mr. Parrack's presentation is the first listed. Mr. Greig's presentation is the last presentation listed.

Given the inflammatory language of the bigger bags of money and the lack of putting, even --even under the Plaintiff's theory, putting Ted Parrack in the room as the recipient of that information -- Dr. Hurt says I don't know whether he got it or not -- that is not a sufficient basis to admit this document, even if we were to go to the hearsay exception of "I was present when it was said."

THE COURT:  All right.  Well, with Brown & Williamson being a participant, and not just being there, but also a presenter, I'm going to overrule

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=246
1667

the objection.  It comes in.

And as far as comments about money goes, I overruled Mr. Wichmann's objections regarding money, and I'm going to overrule your objection regarding comments about money.

All right.  Let's bring the jurors back.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, before you bring them in, I'm just going to go through what we went over today here, and then the Dorian Gray quote and the bigger bags of money quote, and then I'm going to finish with this witness, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  Bring them in. (The jury returned to the courtroom at 3:39 p.m.)

THE COURT:  All right.  Everyone can be seated.

MR. WICHMANN:  May I proceed, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  You may proceed.

MR. WICHMANN:  One more document, and then we go home for the weekend.

Would you put up PT 2412 please? CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. WICHMANN:

A.   I have.

Q.   Was this document publicly available prior to May of 1998?

A.   It was not.

Q.   Okay.  Would you tell the jury what the insignia is at the top of the document?

A.   British American Tobacco.

Q.   Okay.  And what does this document reflect?

A.   Well, it's a conference on trying to figure out new markets and how to get into new markets. That's why it's called Structured Creativity Conference.  And that's -- the whole purpose, was to figure out how to get into new markets, including places like Africa and the Middle East.

MR. WICHMANN:  Would you put up 2 412 page 4,

please? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Would you tell the jury whether Brown & Williamson, now owned by --

Well, would you tell whether a Brown & Williamson employee was present?

A.   Correct.  It's listed as Ted Parrack, Brown & Williamson USA.

Q.   Would you turn to page 48?  Please read to the jury what the document says that's highlighted?

Q.   Please read this summary to the jury.

A.   So qive them what they seem to want, taste and value.  And always remember that while Kinq James I issued his famous, quote, Counterblast to Tobacco, end quote, in 1604, it is nicer from our point of view to remember Oscar Wilde's words in The -- in quote, The Picture of Dorian qray, end quote, in 1891, quote:  A ciqarette is the perfect type of a pleasure -- perfect pleasure.  It is exquisite and it leaves one unsatisfied.  What more could one want?  End quote.

For our purposes, I'd kind of like to get an idea from Reynolds how much time they plan to spend with Dr. Hurt, so I can arrange for my next witness, who would either about Dr. Cummings, who is coming down from South Carolina, or the other option might be the treating physician, Dr. Cromartie.  We also have a video that I think we've --

But I need to kind of get an idea of timing.

THE COURT:  Well, talk to Mr. Harrison about that.

Now, Dr. Hurt, since you are technically up on the stand, just like during short recesses, about not talking with the lawyers about the case, it might be a long -- it's a long recess, but don't talk to the lawyers about your testimony.

THE WITNESS:  I understand.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. HARRISON:  And, Your Honor �

Yeah.  Dr. Hurt can be excused.

THE COURT:  You can get -- you can get going to the airport, if you wish.

All right.  Let's go home for the weekend. Everybody have a good one.

PROCEEDINGS

(Court called to order at 9:00 a.m.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  Please be seated.

Okay.  We've got some matters to take up before we get the jurors in?

MR. MILLARD:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  What have you got going?

MR. MILLARD:  First, we want to move into evidence the materials that we had to summit.  I believe that's been done.  Correct?

THE CLERK:  Yes.

MR. WICHMANN:  So we've complied with the Court's order, and provided the redacted copies and the restricted copies of those exhibits.

And then the next issue for the Court is that I would just like to update you on Mrs. Rounds' condition.  She's still in the hospital.  We are hoping and expecting that she gets released today, and if that's the case, we expect her to be back in court this week.  So with Your Honor's permission, I would like to just to tell the jury, not that she's been in the hospital, but that she's still recovering and will not be present today.

THE COURT:  Well, I think they will assume

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=259
1680

that whether you say anything or not.  Why don't you go ahead and not say anything about it today.

MR. MILLARD:  Okay.  Fine.

Your Honor, the lineup today after Dr. Hurt finishes testifying is we have a corporate representative videotaped deposition, and we have the treating physician.  There are maybe just a couple of minutes of objections that need to be addressed by the Court to portions of the videotaped corporate rep deposition.  So I think we can take that up at the point in time that we -- that we offer it.

So aside from that, there is nothing else from the plaintiff.

THE COURT:  All right.  Now, you're going to have another witness ready just in case Mr. Harrison doesn't take lot of time this morning?

MR. MILLARD:  Yes.  Well, that would be the corporate representative of R.J. Reynolds, Dr. Figlar.  And we also have the treating physician, Dr. Cromartie, on call for after lunch

THE COURT:  All right.  Okay.  Anything on the defense side?

MS. PARKER:  Yes, Your Honor.  Good morning.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=260
1681

Just very briefly.  There is another tobacco trial going on in Pensacola that actually started the same day as ours.  So I'm having to coordinate with that trial team with respect to a witness that we've listed here.

So we talked this morning, and I have asked him to let me know when they planned to rest so I will know when I need to have a witness here. They don't know.  So I just want to alert the Court, I'm trying to get that straightened out.

THE COURT:  So are we ahead of them or behind them?

MS. PARKER:  We're right at the same point that they're at.

THE COURT: Okay. Well, let's get ahead of them.

MS. PARKER: I just need some -- as soon as they can tell me, I need to know so I can get --make sure we don't have a problem.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. PARKER:  That was one thing.

And then their -- after their witnesses today, they have told us that their next witness after that is a Dr. Cummings, who is an expert witness for them.  For Dr. Hurt, they used 23

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=261
1682

exhibits.  They have disclosed over 120 exhibits for Dr. Cummings.  So we're going to need some time to talk to Your Honor about our objections to those, perhaps tomorrow morning.  But I just want to give Your Honor a heads-up about that.

And then finally, we are -- we had some back-and-forth with the plaintiffs in the Lewis case, so just out of an abundance of caution, I want to mention this to the Court.  We are not going to move into evidence during their case today the documents we use on cross.  We're going to wait and hold those, and the ones we use on cross, we'll establish the basis through this witness but we'll actually formally move them in evidence in front the jury in our case in chief.

THE COURT:  All right.  You're going have them marked for ID purposes, though?

MS. PARKER:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  We use letters for ID.  Is that how you have them marked?

MR. HARRISON:  I have demonstratives.  I also have exhibit numbers AIW, and then a number, and ETS number so that I can identify them for the record, which ones we used.  If that -- that works for Your Honor.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=262
1683

We have done it this way in the past. Mechanically, it's pretty easy, the documents they use to identify them, and then we can -- when we move them in in the case in chief, we'll identify them so the jury will know exactly what we're talking about.

THE COURT:  All right.  But my clerk tells me that it's confusing.  I'm going to make you use letters, and I will have her put on stickers with the letters on it.

All right.  Well, you can keep your number on it, but she's going to put her letter on.

MR. HARRISON:  Which is perfect.  I think when we admit them to the jury, we'll admit them as Defense 1, Defense 2.  I think that's what you're suggesting?

THE COURT:  Well, no.  When they come into evidence, we'll use a number.

MR. HARRISON:  Okay.

THE COURT:  While you're having them identified, we need to put a letter on them.

MR. HARRISON:  Okay.

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.

MS. PARKER:  And then just very briefly.  So today is a Tuesday.  We don't know the witnesses

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Good morning, Dr. Hurt.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=265
1686

A.   Good morning.

Q.   To be clear, you're not testifying here as one of Mr. Rounds' treating physicians, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   You're testifying here in your own individual capacity, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   You never spoke to Mr. Rounds or treated Mr. Rounds when he was alive, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And you never talked to Mrs. Rounds about this case, correct?

A.   That is correct.

Q.   And you never talked to any of Mr. Rounds' treating physicians in this case, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Now, during your direct examination, you showed a number of slides regarding the Mayo Clinic. Do you remember those?

A.   I do.

Q.   And you showed a slide with the original Mayo and his two sons, correct?

A.   Correct.

MR. HARRISON:  Will, can we have Dem 7 6 and

392.  We'll mark this as Defense 1.

pgNbr=266
1687

(Defense Exhibit 1 marked for

identification.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   This is an article from the Bucks County Medical Monthly from January 1958, correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   And it says that Dr. Charles W. Mayo, one of the country's most noted medical men, does not believe there is a connection between smoking and lung cancer. Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

MR. HARRISON:  Take that down, please. THE WITNESS:  This was -- this was not

Dr. Charley, this is Dr. Chuck.  So this is the

son of Dr. Charley, who was also a very heavy

smoker. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   To be clear, you're not testifying here as a representative of the Mayo Clinic, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   You retired in 2014, you told us, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   You're testifying here today as a retained witness for the plaintiff, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=267
1688

Q.   And the rate you're charging for this case is $700 per hour?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And $5,600 a day for your testimony, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Now, prior to coming down to Daytona last week, I believe you'd made approximately $26,000 in this case?

A.   I couldn't tell you.

Q.   Okay.  Before -- you've had two depositions in this case, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And for each of those deposition, you charged $5,600 for the day, correct?

A.   I think one was more than that.  One was $5,600, one was last less than that, because it didn't last very long.

Q.   Okay.  And prior to your first deposition, you told us you had spent roughly 14 hours and charged roughly $9,800?

A.   I couldn't tell you.  But that's -- 14 hours would be about right.  Sounds right.

Q.   And you also charged for your travel time coming to and from Daytona from Minnesota, correct?

A.   Yes.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=268
1689

Q.   What day did you get down here last week?

A.   Wednesday.

Q.   So you were here for Wednesday, Thursday and Friday?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And then you -- I assume you flew down here yesterday again, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And then today as well?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So five days of trial testimony?

A.   Five days total, yes.

Q.   Okay.  And that's roughly another $28,000, correct?

A.   You do the math.  That's fine.

Q.   Okay.  Now, this isn't your first time testifying as a witness for plaintiffs in a smoking and health case in Florida, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   You became involved with tobacco litigation in Florida in about 2010?

A.   Sounds right.  I was still working at the time, yes.

Q.   The Bishop case?

A.   Pardon?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=269
1690

Q.   The Bishop case?

A.   Basically.  I was still working, and that was the charges.  The charges you're talking about are the charges that Mayo Clinic charged for my time when I was still working.  And I had time, but then Mayo Clinic received the money for any of those charges until I retired.  That's the way it worked.

Q.   And, Dr. Hurt, I just want to focus for now on the number of cases you've testified in.  You've worked on at least 12 other tobacco cases since your first, correct?

A.   I haven't -- I do not know how many there are.  That sounds about right.

Q.   Okay.  And you've testified at nine other trials, correct?

A.   Sounds right.

Q.   Okay.  And in those trials, you used many of the same slides you showed this jury, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And within the next two weeks, you're going to testify over in St. Pete in the Ahrens case, correct?

A.   Ahrens sounds right, yes.

Q.   This is also not your first time working with Mr. Wichmann in a tobacco case in Florida, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

A.
	That's correc
	t.
	
	

Q.
	Three of the

	a' ve
	worked on have been

A.
	Yes.
	
	
	

Q.
	Now, in addit

given presentations ab

	wit
	nesses in your

position
	should and sh
	ould not
	do
	when testifying,

correct?
	
	
	
	

A.
	I have given
	several,

	a long time ago and

then some to the law s

BY MR. HARRISON:
		
	
	

Q.
	This will be
	for demo
	nstrative purposes.  You
	
recognize this slide,
		correct?
	
	

A.
	Correct.  Tha
	t' s my s
	lide
	�

Q.
	This is your
	slide on
	dep
	osition goals,

correct?
	
	
	
	

A.
	Correct.
	
	
	

Q.
	And the jury
	has hear
	d a
	little bit about

depositions.  But what
		it is,
	is each side gets the
	
opportunity to ask the
		other side
		their facts and

opinions,
	correct?
	
	
	

A.
	Correct.  And
	there is no
		referee, there is

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=271
1692

no judge in the deposition, just the lawyers and whoever the witness is.

Q.   The lawyers for both sides are there, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.

A.   Well, sometimes.  Sometimes they're on the telephone.

Q.   And this slide is a slide that you made and represents your thoughts, correct?

A.   Correct.  And I'd never went to law school either.  Just my thoughts on having had this experience in the Minnesota tobacco trial in 1998, and these are the things that I learned during that time.

Q.   Okay.  One of the things that you put as a deposition goal is to avoid yes or no answers, correct?

A.   That's one of the things, yeah.

Q.   One of the other points you make is a deposition goal is to get your messages in, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And also, don't give up any points, correct?

A.   Right.  Get messages in, because sometimes the questions are so direct that they can be taken out of context.  So you ask a question and I answer only yes or no, then that appears in the trial, taken

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=272
1693

totally out of context of where the question was within the context of the deposition.

Q.   And �

A.   And the other side is to basically break down the expert in this case, the expert report, which was done in Minnesota, to basically neutralize the individual and to make it so that they can't testify at trial.

Q.   This is a deposition.  You have another slide that refers to cross-examination, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And this is -- these are your thouqhts on cross-examination, correct?

A.   These are -- these are the thinqs that I thouqht were important, yes.

Q.   Okay.  And one of the thinqs you say is important is "yes or no when the answer is obvious," correct?

A.   That's one the thinqs I said, yes.

Q.   So if I ask you an obvious question, I can expect a yes or no answer today?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And once aqain, one of your points for cross-examination is qet messaqes in, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   And cross-examination, that's what we're doing right now, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.  In addition to that presentation, you also participated in a conference in Boston in 2002 devoted to litigation strategy in tobacco cases, correct?

A.   That's correct.

MR. HARRISON:  Will, can we put up the

pamphlet, please, AHV1323. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   The conference was titled How to Win a Just Tobacco Verdict, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And this conference was for plaintiffs' attorneys and the public health community only, correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q. So, for example, defense attorneys like me were not allowed -- were not allowed to attend this conference, correct?

A.   I had nothing to do with any of that, so I'm not sure who was -- who was there and who wasn't there

Q.   You gave a presentation at this conference, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=274
1695

A.   I did.

Q.   The title of your presentation at that conference was The Lead-Off Witness, correct?

A. That's correct. And that's basically because I was lead-off witness in the Minnesota tobacco trial, and they asked me to give my experience with that, and that's what I did.

Q.   And you're serving as the lead-off witness in this case, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   One of the other presentations, it was called The Key to Giant Verdicts, correct?

A.   I don't remember, but that looks like it's written that way, yes.

Q.   Now --

A.   I don't know who gave that.  I didn't give that presentation, so I don't know who gave that.

Q.   Now, the jury has heard that Dr. Cummings is going to be one of plaintiff's witnesses later this week.  You know Dr. Cummings was present at this conference --

MR. MILLARD:  Object.  Let me object, Your

Honor.  Can't -- one expert can't comment on the

testimony of other expert.

THE COURT:  Well, he's not asking that.  But

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=275
1696

I'm going to sustain the objection. Go ahead. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Cummings was present at this conference as well, correct?

A.   I think that's right, yes.

Q.   And speaking of Dr. Cummings, when you first became involved in tobacco litigation in Florida, one of the things you did was to review Dr. Cummings' trial testimony from another case, correct?

A.   I recall that, yes.

Q.   And you wanted to understand the flow of the questioning, correct?

A.   Correct.  Because it had been a long time since I had actually done any testifying.  I only did the Minnesota tobacco trial, and then the first trial in Florida was many years after that.

Q.   And you understand from your own experience, both in the cases you and Dr. Cummings have testified in together as well as others, that he's testified in a number of these cases, correct?

A.   I think that's correct, but I don't -- I don't keep track of that.

Q.   Going to the opinions that you have given in each of the cases in which you've testified here in

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=276
1697

Florida, you've testified that the smoker in the case was addicted, correct?

A.   They met the criteria for being addicted, yes .

Q.   Now, in this case, you came to the opinion that Mr. Rounds was addicted before you read a single deposition in the case, correct?

A.   I don't think so, but I read some things, and I can't remember exactly how -- what the sequence of events would have been.

Mr. Harrison:  May I approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  You may.

(A document was handed to the witness.) MR. HARRISON:  Would Your Honor like a copy? THE COURT:  That's okay. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, you recall being deposed in this case, correct?

A.   I recall being deposed in the case, yes.

Q.   If you could turn with me to page 34 of this deposition.  And to be clear, when you took your deposition, you were under oath at the time, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Just like you are in this courtroom, correct?

A.   Correct.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=277
1698

Q.   Okay.  And you were asked this question on lines 1 through 6:

So then is your answer "yes," you did come to the opinion that, more likely than not, Mr. Rounds was addicted to cigarettes before you read a single deposition?

ANSWER:  Most likely, but I reserved the right to make sure that all is correct when I got the documents themselves, yes.

Did I read that correctly? A.   Correct.

Q.   And you also came to your opinion that Mr. Rounds was addicted in this case before you looked at a single one of Mr. Rounds' medical records, correct?

A.   That's what it says. Q.   You can put the deposition aside. A.   But I answered the question.  See, that's the problem -- that's the problem with reading things out of context.  I can't remember if we had any medical records in the initial.  I don't think we had any medical records in the initial conversation that I had that Mr. Wichmann referred to.  I can't remember.  So that was the answer to your question.

So taking things out of the context is the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=278
1699

reason for messaging, is to make sure that it's clear what actually was said.

And I don't know exactly what happened on page 33 either, the question before that or the answers before that.

Q.   Dr. Hurt, I think what you were reading from -- I will just read the question and answer, if it's all the same to you.

Starting at line 7 and going to line 16. A.   Okay.

Q.   And you came to the opinion, more likely than not, that Mr. Rounds was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine before you looked at a single medical record, right?

ANSWER:  I can't remember if we had any medical records in the initial -- I don't think we had any medical records in the initial conversation that I had -- that Mr. Wichmann referred to.  I can't remember.

QUESTION:  Right?  Well �

ANSWER:  I didn't specifically look at them,

no

Did I read that correctly? A.   You did. Q.   When you did review the medical records, you

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=279
1700

actually reviewed them in connection with Mr. Wichmann, correct?

A.   I did some of that, but I can't really remember exactly the specifics.

Q.   Mr. Wichmann would point out to you certain things in the medical records or in the deposition testimony, correct?

A.   He did.  At some point -- I'm trying to remember, going back to the page before that, exactly the sequence of events and the sequence of the questions there.  So I had an initial conversation with Mr. Wichmann about Mr. Rounds and his situation. That's how this all started.  I think that's the context in which these questions were asked.

Q.   You can put the deposition down.

My -- my next question is, you agree that Mr. Rounds permanently quit smoking, correct?

A.   Well, it's hard to say he did.  Eventually, because he died.  But it's unclear as to when -- when he actually stopped smoking for good.  There is different testimony from different people.  For example, Ms. DeLucia, the worker, his co-worker, said he didn't stop smoking until he really got sick.  And that's a little bit different than what some of the other people said.  So he did finally stop smoking, and

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=280
1701

I'm not sure the date that that occurred.

Q.   Okay.  And I just want it to be clear. Mr. Rounds permanently quit smoking while he was alive, correct?

A.   Well, that's what they said.  I think that's correct.  But she said that he didn't stop smoking completely until he really got sick, which would have been after he got -- started with his chemotherapy and radiation therapy, which would have been after the time that other people said that he stopped smoking.  So it's a little unclear as to when that actually occurred.

Q. But it is your opinion that Mr. Rounds permanently quit smoking sometime before he was diagnosed with cancer, correct?

A.   Well, that's -- again, that's not completely clear.  And in reviewing the depositions of all the different people that saw him, it's unclear when that actually occurred.

Q.   Okay.  If you could turn back to your deposition again, page 70 --

A.   Okay.

Q.   -- starting at line 25 and going to page 71, line 5.

QUESTION:  When is -- what's your opinion

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=281
1702

about when he quit smoking permanently?

ANSWER:  That's what I just said.  It's a little unclear as to actually when that occurred. Probably a year, year and a half to two years before he died.  So it was sometime before the diagnosis of lung cancer in 1995.

Did I read that correctly, sir?

A.   You did.

Q.   We're going to look through a few medical records.  You talked about one on direct that noted tobacco abuse, correct?

A.   Sorry.  Go ahead.  Say it again.  I was distracted.

Q.   On direct, you talked about a medical record that said tobacco abuse, correct?

A.   That was one the diagnoses in the dismissal summary, yes.

Q.   And to be clear, that record was from 1996, correct?

A.   I would have to look at it to see.

Q.   I will pull that up at some point.

A.   I mean, if you say it's 1996, I have no reason to doubt that.

Q.   And I will certainly show it to you at some point so we can be clear.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=282
1703

A.   Sure.

Q.   But to be clear, by 1996, Mr. Rounds had quit smoking, correct?

A.   Correct.  That was the year he died.

MR. HARRISON:  Can I have the ELMO, please? MR. SMITH:  Sure. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   I just want to go through a few of Mr. Rounds' medical records.  This is the Dr. Shelton letter you discussed on direct, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And Dr. Shelton in March of 1992 writes to Mr. Rounds, I can be helpful with stop smoking.  This will require a commitment on your part to an intensive period of one to two times weekly office visits to help with behavior modification.

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   And you recall that Dr. Shelton approached Mr. Rounds and encouraged him to come see Dr. Shelton to quit smoking, correct?

A.   Well, yes.  And the first sentence also says, After having informal discussions with you many times in the hallway, I wanted to forward you a letter confirming that.  And he also added, You know your COPD

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=283
1704

is worsening.

So the context of this is apparently they saw each other fairly frequently, and he had talked to Mr. Rounds on several occasions before.  And this was a letter just really strongly recommending him to come in to get some help.

Q. And we'll talk about this later, but you agree with Dr. Shelton that quitting smoking does require commitment, correct?

A.   It does.  And you have to show up, yes.

Q.   And you agree that behavior modification is an effective way to help people quit smoking?

A.   Yeah.  There are two things that are effective:  Behavioral modification or behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy.  Those are the two things that have been proven to help people stop smoking.

Q.   And Dr. Shelton helped Mr. Rounds quit smoking through the use of both of those, from this record and from what we know about the evidence in the case, correct?  The patch.

A.   Yes.  And so this was in March, and then we have the second letter from September, which showed that he stopped making the appointments.

Q.   Okay.  And as you bring it up, that's the next letter.  This is from Dr. Shelton in September of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=284
1705

that year, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you noted the missed appointments. Dr. Shelton writes, I hope you are still not smoking. Correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Dr. Shelton doesn't mention any relapse, correct?

A.   No, but he talked about him missing appointments.  And apparently, you know, he had two appointments in September, I'm assuming -- I guess this is an assumption that he had some appointments fairly regularly from March to September, but then missed these two appointments.  And we don't have any record of what happened after that as far as any other notice from Dr. Shelton.

Q.   You didn't see any records from Dr. Shelton that Mr. Rounds had resumed smoking, correct?

A.   No.  But when you miss appointments, at least in our place, when you stop coming back for appointments, chances are widely correct that the person has relapsed to smoking.

Q.   This is a record --

MR. MILLARD:  Your Honor, may we approach on

this?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=285
1706

THE COURT:  All right.  Come on up.

(At the bench.)

MR. MILLARD:  Just briefly, Judge.  We are skirting into dangerous waters here.  There are, I believe, two entries about beer consumption in the medical records.

Clearly, Mr. Harrison intends to cross-examine the witness on those.  That's fine. But we don't want him to go beyond that into matters that Your Honor has already said may be excluded by the motion in limine.

So I think we have an understanding.  I just want to make sure.

MR. HARRISON:  Putting aside whether Your Honor has excluded it, all I'm asking is he drank beer, and then later I'll talk about beer and motivation.  Mr. Millard said he doesn't have a problem.  If Mr. Wichman has a problem, that's as far as going with Dr. Hurt today.

MR. MILLARD:  All right.  I just wanted to confirm that.

THE COURT:  All right.  There is no objection at this time?

MR. MILLARD:  Not at this time.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. HARRISON:  Thank you. (In open court.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Back to the record.  You recognize this record, correct?

A.   I do.

Q.   This is a record from Dr. Cromartie?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And it is dated September of 1995, correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   Dr. Cromartie reports the patient smokes cigarettes, one and a half packs per day, for 35 years, but he quit four years ago.  He drinks beer. Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   This is a 1996 record from Dr. Steven White. You recognize this record, correct?

A.   I do.

Q.   And you see Dr. White said, Mr. Rounds smoked until 1991, correct?

A.   And he has about an 80- to 90-pack a year history, which is inconsistent with the previous record.  A pack and a half day for 35 years doesn't get up to the 80- or 90-pack years.  One pack a day for a year is a one-pack year.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=287
1708

So -- and the other thing is that 35 years of smoking is inconsistent with what his sister said:  He started smoking at age 15.  So there is some inconsistency in the records here.  And people that would know the best about his smoking history are the people that were in the room with him or in the house with him.

Q.   To the extent there are inconsistencies, the records are consistent that both Dr. Cromartie and Dr. White referred to Mr. Rounds as a former?

A.   At different times.  So that's -- again, the inconsistency of that is such that -- and Ms. DeLucia is one, and Mrs. Rounds had a little bit of a different take on it, so there are -- it really isn't clear exactly when he stopped smoking.  But it was sometime before he died.

Q.   This is a record from Dr. Hinerman from 1995, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And Dr. Hinerman notes, Mr. Rounds is a 57-year-old white male with a long history of cigarette smoking, which he quit a number of years ago, correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   This is a 1995 record from Dr. Shelton, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=288
1709

A.   That's what it says, yes.

Q.   And you understand that this is the same Dr. Shelton who wrote the previous letters we looked at it, correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   Dr. Shelton tells us he has a long history of smoking, quitting several years ago and continues to drink some.

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   You talked about Mrs. Rounds.  I believe you told us at your deposition, you recall that Mrs. Rounds testified that Mr. Rounds quit smoking in around 1991 or 1992, correct?

A.   I think that's what they said, yes.

Q.   And she doesn't recall Mr. Rounds ever smoking again after that time, correct?

A.   That's what she says.

Q.   You talked about Mr. Rounds.  To give a little background, based on your review of the record, you understand Mr. Rounds was born in Vermont, correct?

A.   No, I do not -- I don't recall, but I think that's -- he was from the northeast, you asked me. That's where they met.  I think they met in Vermont.

Q.   And Mr. and Mrs. Rounds actually met in 1973,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=289
1710

correct?

A.   Yes.  They got married in 1974.

Q. Okay. When Mr. and Mrs. Rounds lived in Vermont, you saw that they owned a bar called the Powder Horn Tavern, correct?

A.   I don't remember the name of it.

Q.   You recall that they owned a tavern?

A.   I think that's right.

Q. And they bought a second one down here in Florida when they moved to Florida called Grade's Place, correct?

A.   I don't remember the name.

Q.   Okay.  Now, Mr. Rounds not only owned the bars, Mr. and Mrs. Rounds owned bars, Mr. Rounds worked at the bars, correct?

A.   I think that's correct.

Q.   Okay.  And you saw in Mrs. Rounds' deposition that they had a cigarette vending machine at the bar, correct?

A.   I don't recall that.

MR. MILLARD:  Your Honor, I would object.  He

doesn't recall.  It didn't play a part in his

opinions.  It's beyond the scope --

THE COURT:  All right.  Well, he hasn't asked

a question yet.

Don't start reading from the deposition. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, if you could turn to page 221, line 10.

A.   Two?

Q.   221, line 10.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Just read it to yourself, please, sir.

A.   Okay.

Q.   You reviewed Mrs. Rounds' deposition in preparation for your testimony, correct?

A.   I did.

Q.   And does this refresh your recollection that the Powder Horn Tavern had a vending machine that sold cigarettes?

MR. MILLARD:  Objection, Your Honor.  I think

he needs to ask the witness did he review this and

did it play a part in his opinion.

THE COURT:  All right.  Ask the first

question. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Did you review this and did it play a part in your opinion?

A.   I reviewed this, but I don't recall this --this section at all.  I mean, you know, just so

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=291
1712

everybody understands, this is page 223, and this goes to page 700, so this is just part of the deposition. So when you review these things, you can't remember everything.  I don't remember this, but it's what she said, so it's on the record.

Q.   Okay.  And you understand, to the extent that the Rounds had a cigarette machine that sold cigarettes in the '70s, that every pack of cigarettes that came out of that machine would have had the cigarette warning label, correct?

MR. MILLARD:  Objection, Your Honor.  Again, I don't think he has established that the witness relied on the record or that this part of the deposition played any part in his opinions.  So I think it's beyond the scope of direct. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  So at that time, if this was in the 1970s, it would have been kind of the second set of warnings.  The first set came out in the mid '60s, and the second set or the second warning came on in the late 1960s, changing "may," in the original, to "is hazardous to your health."  And that was the second set of warnings.  So these would have been labeled, yes. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Now, when Mr. and Mrs. Rounds moved to Florida in 1979, you know Mr. Rounds went to school to become a pharmacy technician, correct?

A.   That's what he eventually worked as, yes.

Q.   Okay.  And in 1981, he started working as a pharmacy technician at Halifax Hospital, correct?

A.   I don't remember the year, but he worked as a pharmacy tech for his entire career, I think, at Halifax, yes.

Q.   And you also saw that Mrs. Rounds was a registered nurse, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And she also worked at Halifax Hospital as a registered nurse, correct?

A.   I think that's right, yes.

Q.   Okay.  And you saw that Mrs. Rounds was a nurse for most of her adult life, at least since she met Mr. Rounds?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And you also saw that Mrs. Rounds worked with oncologists who treated cancer patients, correct?

A.   I think that's right.

Q.   Including lung cancer patients, correct?

A.   It would be the full gamut, yes.

Q.   And Mrs. Rounds actually worked in the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=293
1714

oncology ward, cancer ward, at Halifax Hospital back in 1982 with Dr. Smith, correct?

A.   I don't recall that, but if you say that's in the record, that's fine.

Q.   Well, if you turn to page 264 of Mrs. Rounds' deposition.

MR. MILLARD:  What page, counsel? MR. HARRISON:  264, starting at line 4. THE WITNESS:  Right.  Okay. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Does that refresh your recollection as to whether Mrs. Rounds worked in the oncology unit in 1981 or 1982?

A.   She said "probably," so I assume she did.

Q.   Dr. Smith, we looked at one of his records already.  That's actually the cancer doctor that diagnosed Mr. Rounds' cancer, correct?

A.   I think that's correct.

Q.   Okay.  As we talked about Mr. Rounds, you saw that his family members described him as intelligent?

A.   Yes.

That he was someone who had common sense?

Correct.

Who is described as a hard worker?

Yes.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=294
1715

Q.   And strong-willed?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And his family explained that if he said he was going to do something, he usually did it, correct?

A.   Well, again, the way those questions are phrased in depositions are just like you said, and then the person has to answer yes or no.  So the phrasing of the question is --

We, in medicine, we don't do it quite that way.  We ask open-ended questions of what do you think about this or what do you think about that, rather than giving the question to getting an answer yes or no.

So what you read I think was what the deposition said, yes.

Q.   Let's switch gears and talk about Mr. Rounds' smoking.

You would agree there is no evidence as to why Mr. Rounds started smoking, correct?

A.   No.  I remember the -- I think the younger sister talked about his starting smoking, and one of the things he would do is he would roll up the cigarettes on his T-shirt sleeve, which in -- back in those days was kind of a badge that young boys would do with their peers.  I don't know that they ever talked about his peers that much, but I recall her mentioning

that at
	least once or twice, that when he started
	

smoking
	at age 15, became a heavy smoker by the age
	of

17.  Two
	packs a day by 17 is what I recall.

A.

	Okay.  And we talked about this earlier.
	

Neither
	Mrs. Rounds nor any of the Rounds' children
	or

stepchildren were around prior to -- around Mr. Rounds
		
prior to
	1973, correct?
	

A.
	Correct.
	

Q.
	Nancy was the only witness who was present
	

prior to
	1973 at any point, correct?
	

A.
	His younger sister, yes.
	

Q.
	Okay.  And you saw that Nancy testified that
	
she wasn
	't present when Mr. Rounds smoked his first

cigarette, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   There is no evidence of where Mr. Rounds got his first cigarette, correct?

A.   Not that I know of, no.

Q.   There is no evidence who Mr. Rounds was with when he smoked his first cigarette?

A.   No.

Q.   There is no evidence of what Mr. Rounds' reaction was when he smoked his first cigarette, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And there is no evidence regarding which brand Mr. Rounds smoked when he had his first cigarette, correct?

A.   No.  She mentioned Luckies was the first brand, but I'm not sure that was the very first cigarette.  And I also mentioned then later on in the deposition that he had, when asked about his reaction to the first cigarette, if he reacted like most teenagers do.  It would have been a pretty noxious sort of reaction with nausea, light-headedness.  But we don't have that for the record.

Q.   So based on your experience with cigarettes and smokers, you would expect that Mr. Rounds' initial

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=297
1718

reaction to smoking would have been adverse, correct?

A.   Correct.  So when we have patients in front of us, we usually ask them, Tell me about your experience with your first cigarette.  An open-ended question.  And they say, Well, you know, I really got light-headed, I got nauseated.  I felt like I was going throw up.

So the second question we ask is, Well, how did you respond?  How did you get over that?

Well, the answer is, Well, I smoked some more.

And that's where tolerance begins to take effect.

Q.   As far as when Mr. Rounds began smoking, you've looked at the Dr. Cromartie record once already. This record we talked about was from 1995, correct?

A.   I think that's right, yes.

Q.   And it notes that Mr. Rounds quit smoking four years prior, correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   That would have taken us to 1991, correct?

A.   Correct.  But it also says he smoked a pack and a half per day for 35 years, which we know just isn't correct.  He started smoking at age 15, was a heavy smoker at age 17, so 17 plus 35 doesn't get you

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=298
1719

the right mathematics.  So this is what he got from the history taken.  The history.

Q.   And based on your experience, the history and physical section comes from the patient, correct?

A.   Sometimes.  Sometimes they fill out questionnaires.  Sometimes they talk directly to the patient.  So it varies from place to place.  It's like I mentioned in direct, when we assessed how the question about smoking was asked at our place, we found out throughout the institution that it asked like 114 different ways.  So depending on what usually is taken by someone, a person, not always a physician, sometimes a patient fills out a form and fills in the records. So it's patient-derived information, that's correct.

Q.   And you disagree with Dr. Cromartie's report about when Mr. Rounds began smoking, correct?

A.   Well, it's from his -- this is what he got from someone.  I'm not sure he got it from Mr. Rounds or not.  But from what we know from his sister, who was the best direct observer about when he started smoking, would have been age 15 and a heavy smoker at the age of 17.

Q.   According to this, if we back out the 35 years of previous smoking, that takes us back to 1959, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=299
1720

A.   I'm not -- I can't do the math in my head.

Q.   Mr. Rounds would have been 19 years old in 1959, correct?

A.   That would be about right, right.

Q.   According to the social history coming from the patient, Mr. Rounds, Mr. Rounds reports that he began smoking 35 years prior to when he quit, correct?

A.   No.  It says a pack and a half a day for 35 years.  So it's not when he began.  But this was a pack and a half a day for 35 years.

Q.   Okay.  You agree, Dr. Hurt, that it's fair it says that there is a big window of Mr. Rounds' life, a decade or so, that we just don't have any information regarding his smoking from any witness, correct?

A.   That's a really compound question.  Can you make it little simpler so I can follow it?

Q.   We are missing information regarding Mr. Rounds' smoking from the 1960s through the early 1970s, correct?

A.   I don't think I have seen very much in reference to that time frame, no.  I don't recall exactly.  But I don't -- most of it would come --Mrs. Rounds and he met in '73.  So I'm not sure we had a lot of observations between the time that he left home at age 17 and when she first got to know him.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=300
1721

Q.   And you recall in your review of the depositions that his sister Nancy had moved to California in 1963, correct?

A.   I think that's right.

Q.   Okay.  So between '63, when his sister Nancy leaves, the first witness, and 1973 when Mrs. Rounds and the stepchildren show up, we have no information, correct?

A.   I think that's right.

Q. So during this decade-long period, we have no information about how much Mr. Rounds was smoking from any witness in this case, correct?

A.   Except that he was smoking two packs a day when he was 17 when he left home.  That's what she testified to, the sister.  And so the -- the pattern of smoking doesn't change very much.  So if he was smoking two packs a day at age 17, my assumption would be he was smoking right through the same amount until we have more records later on.

Q.   It's an assumption on your part, correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   There is no eyewitness to testify or who testified as to how much Mr. Rounds was smoking from 1963 to roughly 1973, correct?

A.   And there is no one to say how much he was or

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=301
1722

how much he wasn't smoking.  But people who start smoking, particularly heavy smokers, do not reduce their smoking and then pick it up later on.  So his pattern of smoking would have been pretty consistent during that time.

Q.   You would agree there is no information from any witness as to what brands Mr. Rounds was smoking during this decade-long period, correct?

A.   There are no direct witnesses, no.

Q.   There is no information from any witness in the case regarding the information that is contained within the Heaviness of Smoking Index that you talked about during direct, correct?

A.   For that period of time, there is no -- there is no direct testimony, no.

Q.   If we start from 1973 and go forward into the future, you agree that there are inconsistencies from one witness to another about the brands of cigarettes Mr. Rounds smoked, correct?

A.   There are inconsistencies, but some of it has to do with they saw him smoking just one time.  So what I remember from multiple witnesses was it was Winston, Winston Light and Vantage.  That was kind of the thread of continuity that I recall from more than a couple or three.  It was pretty consistent.  There are people

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=302
1723

that had observed him smoking other things, but those were the things that seemed to be the most consistent.

Q.   Okay.  You recall that the testimony from the witnesses that Mr. Rounds -- from the stepchildren, that Mr. Rounds was smoking an unfiltered brand of cigarettes when they first met him, correct?

A.   I don't recall that.

(A document was handed to the witness.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Doctor, if you could turn to page 38.

A.   Okay.

Q.   And just read to yourself, please, specifically page -- line 38 -- page 38, line 9.

A.   Okay.  So line 9.  So this is the daughter and --

Q.   And, Doctor, I just want to ask you, does that refresh your recollection as to whether there is evidence in the case that Mr. Rounds was smoking unfiltered cigarettes when the Rounds children met him in 1973?

A.   Well, she was being asked to try to figure out what it was.  And so she was trying to remember back.  So the page before that, it talks -- the lead-up to the question you're asking.  And she's trying to recall, and then dating it backwards.  So I'm trying to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=303
1724

figure that 16 period -- year period, this question. So -- and then later on it mentions -- mentions some cigarettes, yes.

Q.   Okay.  And she mentions, in fact, unfiltered Pall Mall, correct?

A.   He smoked nonfiltered Pall Mall in the red pack when I was really little.

Q.   And to be fair, that's one of the brands that's on the chart you showed, correct?

A.   Correct.  And she goes on to say "and Winston and Winston Lights, Vantage, Marlboro at one time I think briefly."

So this is, you know, she says what the others have said too, Winston, Winston Light and Vantage.  It's just the second part to the question.

Q.   Okay.  You mentioned that Nicole Rounds mentioned that Mr. Rounds -- she recalls him smoking Marlboro, correct?

A.   At one time, I think, briefly, is what she said.  And she saw -- I don't have a year.  He smoked Camels also when I was little, young.

So she's recalling back her first memories of his smoking history.  That's what she struggled with on the previous page, trying to figure out how far back her memory went.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=304
1725

Q.   Okay.

A.   So the question:  Okay.  So you mentioned Pall Mall, Camel, Winston, Winston Lights, Vantage and Marlboro.  Do you remember any other brand? And she says, I don't recall.

Q.   And you saw -- by the way, Marlboro is made by Philip Morris, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And you saw evidence that Mrs. Rounds testified that Mr. Rounds sometimes smoked Marlboro, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And you read the deposition of Carolyn DeLucia, Mr. Rounds' co-worker of nine or ten years. And you saw where she recalled the only brand that Mr. Rounds smoked was Marlboro, correct?

A.   I don't know if she saw only, but I remember her saying something about Marlboro, yes.  And that's mentioned earlier.  There are inconsistencies, both with how much and how long, but also the brands.  But the common thread between all of the ones that I remember was Winston, Winston Lights, and Vantage.

And he -- Mrs. Rounds talked about -- or one the sons talked about him dissecting Vantage cigarettes and showing the brown stuff in the filter and so on.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=305
1726

So though there's other smatterings of other brands, the consistent ones were Winston, Winston Light and Vantage.

Q.   Dr. Hurt, if you could turn to page 123 of Carolyn DeLucia's deposition transcript, please.

A.   Okay.

Q.   And Ms. DeLucia was asked, Question, starting at lines 21, through 124, line 1.

A.   123 what?

Q.   123, line 21.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Through 124, line 1.

QUESTION:  You never saw Terry with a pack of Winston cigarettes, did you?

ANSWER:  I only saw the Marlboro and the Marlboro Lights.

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   And that was Carolyn DeLucia, Mr. Rounds' co-worker's testimony, correct?

A.   Well, it is.  But up above is the question, And I did see -- or the answer, I did see the Marlboro pack at one time.

QUESTION:  Fine.

ANSWER:  So, I mean, for me to say, Oh,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=306
1727

that's all he ever smoked, no, I can't say that, because I don't know for sure.  I don't remember him --I remember him changing somewhere along the line, you know.  I remember him changing to lights.  And then, really, after that, I really don't know what he started to smoke.

So even in the one page, it's a little bit inconsistent.

Q.   Ms. DeLucia was, herself, a Marlboro smoker, correct?

A.   I think that's right.

Q.   You can set that down.  We'll change topics.

A.   Fine.

Q.   You agree that in order to actually quit smoking, a person has to try to quit smoking, correct?

A.   Correct.  Well, I think I said this in direct, sometimes a catastrophic medical condition like a heart attack is something that people, if they survive the heart attack, about half of smokers who survive the heart attack will stop smoking as a result of that.

So trying to quit is part of the process. But some people, when they have a really major medical problem, stop smoking.  Is that trying to quit?  Well, it's in the context of a major medical problem.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=307
1728

Q.   A major medical problem gives them significant motivation to quit smoking, correct?

A.   Well, no.  That's not what I said.  So if you take a hundred smokers, middle-aged men particularly, and they have a heart attack, a third of them don't survive to get to the hospital.  If they survive to get to the hospital, of those 70 or so men, half will stop smoking and the other half won't.  So it's the event itself that leads them to stopping smoking.  Whether or not they're hospitalized or -- that doesn't seem to make a lot of difference.  It's just the event itself.

Q.   I don't want my question to get lost.  You agree that in order to actually quit smoking, you have to try to quit smoking, correct?

A.   No.  That's -- I just tried to explain that, that for some people, having a heart attack is part of the process.  So they didn't try to have a heart attack, and therefore they may have stopped smoking as a result of that.

(A document was handed to the witness.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, I have handed you your trial testimony from the Dion case.  Does that look correct?

A.   This is a deposition.

Q.   A deposition.  The deposition from the Dion

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=308
1729

case?

A.   From Mr. Dion, yes.

Q.   Well, this is -- if you look at the front, this is your deposition testimony from the Dion case, correct?

A.   That's correct.  It's not the trial testimony.  It's the deposition.

Q.   Okay.  If you turn -- if you turn to page 76, line 19 -- lines 19 through 21.

A.   Let me see.  19, page 76?

Q.   Page 76, lines 19 through 21.

A.   Correct.

Q.   You were asked this question.

QUESTION:  And in order to actually quit, you have to try to quit, correct?

And your answer was:  Correct. Did I read that correctly, sir?

A.   Correct.  But the answer before that kind of leads into that.  And it's a long answer, so you don't want to read the whole thing.  But we're talking in the context of motivational interviewing and moving a person toward making an attempt to stop.  So that's where those questions --

So that doesn't really apply to what I just said about people with heart attacks.  That's -- this

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=309
1730

is really in reference to motivational interviewing and moving the person to the process of stopping smoking. That's the context of that.

Q.   You agree there are some smokers who say they want to quit but do nothing about it, correct?

A.   Well, if you go back to looking at the data, which is -- the data shows that almost 80 percent of smokers, when asked the question, Would you rather be a nonsmoker?, 80 percent say yes.  And almost half of smokers try to stop smoking every single year.

So those are the data that we have seen over the last 10 or 15 or 20 years.

MR. HARRISON:  Can I have the ELMO, please? BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   This is the chart you showed the jury on direct examination, correct?

A.   Correct, yes.

Q.   And you know that there are 45 million smokers, correct?

A.   That's about right, yes.  Depends on which year it is.

Q.   As you note on the slide, 31 million people say they want to quit smoking, correct?

A.   That's correct.  The different questions are asked different ways.  So they would rather be a

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=310
1731

nonsmoker, would be the other way of saying it.

Q.   Using your slide, that means that there are 14 million smokers a year who don't say they want to be a nonsmoker or that they want to quit smoking, correct?

A.   Well, that would be correct.

Q.   Okay.  And then if we go for the next bar graph, 16 million smokers actually try to quit in a given year, correct?

A.   That's what I said.  Almost half of smokers try to quit every single year.

Q.   Well, it's half of smokers who say they want to quit, try, correct?

A.   Correct.  That's right.

Q.   There are almost -- there is 29, almost 30 million people who smoke who do nothing to try to quit in a given year, correct?

A.   That would be right.

Q.   And of those who do try to quit, 6.2 percent, or 2.7 million people, are smoking-free six months out, and three percent, or 1.3 million people, ultimately succeed, correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   And after Mr. Rounds had quit smoking for a year, he would fall into that three percent category, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=311
1732

A.   That's correct.

Q.   I believe you told us on direct that some people smoke for the pleasure of smoking, correct?

A.   Some people smoke for the pleasure, yes.

Q.   Some people report that smoking stimulates them?

A.   Some people report that they smoke to stay awake, yes.

Q.   Some people report that smoking relaxes them, correct?

A.   Erroneously, because what we know about this is, is that smoking produces stress rather than relieving stress.  Or some people say it relaxes them, but it's hard to know whether or not that's really relieving withdrawal symptoms or other things.

Q.   Some people report that they enjoy the social aspects of smoking, correct?

A.   Some people report that.  Not very many.

Q.   Now, you saw that Mr. Rounds liked to have a cigarette with his coffee in the morning, correct?

A.   He -- I think he had cigarettes before he made the coffee, so he had it with coffee, yes, and meals and with everything else in his life.  So he --the testimony is that he was smoking all the time.  So it's hard to know whether or not there were that many

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=312
1733

things attached to it that would be of great significance.

Q.   You did see testimony that Mr. Rounds liked to have a cigarette with his coffee, correct?

A.   I think what I remember is he would have cigarettes while he was making the coffee and before he had his coffee, and he'd have cigarettes with coffee, with meals and with everything else.  So there may have been a question that was asked like that and answered "yes."

Q.   If you turn to -- if you turn to page 59 of your deposition in this case.

A.   Okay.

Q.   You were asked at line 20:  And then he also liked to have the cigarette with his coffee? And your answer was:  True. Correct?

A.   Well, the question -- line 16, when he would drink his coffee in the morning, he liked to have a cigarette with his coffee, right?

ANSWER:  He would have a cigarette before he made the coffee.

This is what I just said.

So then -- and then he also liked to have a cigarette with his coffee, right?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=313
1734

Yes, true. So --Q.   And Mr. Rounds also liked to smoke while he was drinking a beer, correct?

A.   That's reported, yes.  That's what I said. Q.   And you saw the testimony that Mr. Rounds had the Florida room, or what his son referred to it as his man cave, and he would smoke and drink beer and watch sports out in his man cave, correct?

A.   Well, I think we -- the answer that I just gave you, and you asked about smoking, that's reported, yes .

And he'd have a cigarette between the meal and dessert.

And I'm not sure what he -- what that had to do with anything, except his nicotine levels were lower.  So, you know, the whole answer to the question was he smoked all the time.

Q.   And you saw, back to my question, that Mr. Rounds, when he was at home, would smoke out of his Florida room, or what his son referred to as his man cave, correct?

MR. MILLARD:  Let me object, Your Honor.  I think this is now repetitious. THE COURT:  Overruled.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=314
1735

THE WITNESS:  Most people referred to it as the Florida room.  And I didn't know what that was until these cases.  So it's a screened-in area.

So I think there was one reference to, quote, man cave, but I'm not sure -- that sounds pejorative to me.  So the Florida room is what I refer -- remember most people talking about when they talked about him being in it. BY MR. HARRISON:

He smoked cigarettes out in the Florida room?

Correct.

Drank beer out in the Florida room?

Correct.

That was sort of his space, correct?

And he ate meals out there.  He did a lot of things out there.  And that's one of the reasons that he was not able to participate in a lot of family activities, because he separated himself outside.  And that was one of the reasons that he didn't -- wasn't able to participate in a lot of family activities.

Q.   We saw a couple medical records that Mr. Rounds drank beer.  We've talked about it.  You saw that Mrs. Rounds testified that Mr. Rounds would drink a couple of beers two or three times a week, correct? MR. MILLARD:  Your Honor, let me object based on what we talked about at side bar.  And I can explain it to Your Honor again.

THE COURT:  Come on up.  All right.  Come on up.

(At the bench.)

THE COURT:  I will allow that question.  But unless you show some relevance, I'm not going to let you keep talking about drinking beer.

MR. HARRISON:  My next question is drinking beer reduces motivation to quit smoking. THE COURT:  All right.  Okay. MR. MILLARD:  We can stop at that? THE COURT:  And go on from there. MR. MILLARD:  Okay.  Thank you. (In open court.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q. Dr. Hurt, you recall Mrs. Rounds' testimony that Mr. Rounds would drink a couple of beers two or three times per week, correct?

A.   I don't recall that specifically, but that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=316
1737

sounds about right.

Q.   And you agree that drinking alcohol like beer can interfere with a person's motivation to quit smoking, correct?

A.   Well, sometimes the two behaviors go together.  So that's the way we talk about it.

(A document was handed to the witness.) MR. MILLARD:  Your Honor, may I?  I guess there is going to be a question.  I think it's beyond what Your Honor talked -- what we discussed at side bar, and I just want to make sure that we're headed in the right direction on this.

THE COURT:  All right.  Well, we will wait for the question.

MR. MILLARD:  Okay. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, if you could turn to page 1368, please, line 14.

MR. MILLARD:  My next objection, after seeing the question and answer, is that this is not impeachment.  He said just --THE COURT:  All right.

MR. MILLARD:  -- a moment ago exactly what's here.

THE COURT:  Bring it up.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1738

(At the bench.)

THE COURT:  All right.  Mr. Harrison, where is the inconsistency?

MR. HARRISON:  What he said here was that the behaviors go hand in hand.  And in Danielson, he gave the direct answer, "Alcohol can interfere, yes."  That's all --

THE COURT:  Well, that's not inconsistent.

MR. HARRISON:  To say they go hand in hand, they go together is not as strong and it's not the question I asked.  I asked him directly --

THE COURT:  I'm sustaining the objection.

(In open court.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, you know that when smokers, not everyone, but when smokers drink alcohol, they tend to smoke more frequently or more often, correct?

MR. MILLARD:  Let me object, Your Honor. Again, we're beyond what Your Honor ruled at side bar.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Correct.  As I mentioned, the behaviors sometimes go together.  Some people smoke more when they drink and some people drink more when they smoke.  So the two behaviors are --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=318
1739

go together fairly often. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   And when you advise people, or when you advise people on quitting smoking, you've told them that they should avoid drinking alcohol for that reason, correct?

A.   Well, and as well as other behaviors as well. Things that are associated with their smoking, whether it's alcohol or talking on the telephone or after meals, we tell them, you know, if you usually would sit at the table and smoke a cigarette after a meal, then change that routine.  Get up and do something else. So all behaviors that are associated with smoking, we try to tell people either to try to avoid them or to lessen them.  And if they can't avoid or lessen them, then they need to be able to have a plan for what are you going to do when you have that situation come up.

Q.   On direct examination, you showed the jury and you discussed a performance evaluation regarding Mr. Rounds, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   To be fair, you did not see any evidence of any similar reprimands before that performance evaluation, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=319
1740

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you didn't see any evidence that Mr. Rounds received any reprimands or comments on his smoking after that performance evaluation, correct?

A.   That's the only evaluation he had.  I think on direct testimony, what I said was you don't write those things down in a formal report just -- there are things leading up to that.  So there are -- usually there would be warnings or usually be conversations in the context of good personnel management.

Q.   Now, you saw -- we've talked about Ms. DeLucia's testimony.  You understand she worked in the pharmacy department with Mr. Rounds, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And you saw that Ms. DeLucia testified that Mr. Rounds was able to comply with the rules that the hospital had regarding smoking, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   You saw that she said there were days when, if the pharmacy got too busy, Mr. Rounds would not go out and have a cigarette, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And you saw that when Mr. Rounds was too busy and couldn't go have a cigarette, that he was still able to carry out his job and didn't have any changes

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=320
1741

in his behavior, correct?

A.   I think that, again, that's the way the question was asked, and then she was asked to answer yes or no.  So you make up the questions, and then she has to answer them one way or the other.

So that's what I recall, yes.  But I don't think she said all of those words.  I think those words were the question, and then she was asked to respond to the question.

Q.   And she agreed with the question, correct?

A.   Apparently, yes.

Q.   And when Halifax Hospital instituted a no-smoking policy, Mr. Rounds continued to work at the hospital, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  You know sometime after the performance evaluation, that Mr. Rounds was recognized as the employee of the month at Halifax Hospital, correct?

A.   Well, I think other people talked about him being a very reliable employee, a very good employee. He was very good at what he did, apparently.

Q.   This will be D-2.  And this is a press release announcing Terry Rounds, September employee of the month, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=321
1742

A.   Yes.  I'm not sure what year it is, but it does say that, yes.  And that's not a surprise.  I mean, he was a very reputable, very good employee.  A very good person.

MR. HARRISON:  You can take that down. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Let's change gears.

Based on your review of the materials in this case, there is no evidence that Mr. Rounds ever tried to quit smoking before the mid 1980s, correct?

A.   Before when?

Q.   The mid 1980s.

A.   I don't recall the dates.  The report that I got was he tried to stop smoking multiple times over a long period of time.  So I'm not sure when -- you know, there was one episode when he went to hypnosis.  I'm not sure when that was.  So -- but there were reports from various people saying he tried to stop smoking a lot.

(A document was handed to the witness.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, this is the continuation of your deposition in this case, correct?

A.   Volume 2, yes.

Q.   If you turn to page 176, lines 11 through 15.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=322
1743

Are you there, sir?

A.   Lines 17?

Q.   Eleven through 15.

A.   Oh, okay.

Q.   You were asked this question.

QUESTION:  I think you said at your last deposition that the earliest quit attempts we have particularly described by Janice Rounds go back to the mid 1980s.  Does that sound right?

ANSWER:  That sounds about right. Did I read that correctly?

A.   Correct.

Q.   You didn't see any evidence that Mr. Rounds made an attempt to quit smoking in the 1950s, correct?

A.   Not that I recall, no.

Q.   Okay.  The same is true for the '60s and the ' 70s, correct?

A.   I don't recall, no.

Q.   Now, you don't have an opinion about a specific number of quit attempts that Mr. Rounds made, correct?

A.   I didn't try to count them up.  The reports that I remember were he tried to stop smoking multiple times, which is fairly consistent with most people in his situation.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=323
1744

Q.   And I think, as you told us, you can't say how many attempts Mr. Rounds may have made or when those attempts were made, correct?

A.   Correct.  There were multiple attempts over a long period of time.

Q. Now, you mentioned hypnosis, and you know that some people successfully do quit smoking with hypnosis, correct?

A.   They do.

Q. And in Mr. Rounds' case, you know, according to Mrs. Rounds, Mr. Rounds went to hypnosis one time, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And when he returned from hypnosis, he told Mrs. Rounds, to use his own words, "it's a bunch of crap," correct?

A.   That's what I recall.

Q.   On direct, you also mentioned the nicotine gum, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q. Mrs. Rounds didn't recall when Mr. Rounds used the nicotine gum, correct?

A.   No.  But there are other people that reported him using the gum.  I can't remember who -- exactly who they all were, but there were several people who

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=324
1745

remembered him using the gum, and several people remembered him using the patch.  There were two or three people who said "I saw him wearing the patch."

So I don't know exactly when those things were, except the gum came out in the 1980s and the patch didn't came out until the early 1990s.

Q.   And when the patch came out in the 1980s -- I think this is what you're saying -- is that it was available by prescription only?

MR. MILLARD:  Let me object, Your Honor.

That's not what the witness said.  He said the gum

came out '80s and the patch came out in the '90s.

And the question was twisted around.

THE COURT:  Do you want to just rephrase,

Mr. Harrison? BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, the nicotine gum came out in the 1980s, correct?

A.   1980s, yes, early to mid 1980s.

Q.   So when the gum came out in the early to mid 1980s, it was available by prescription, correct?

A.   Correct.  And it went over the counter relatively quickly compared to the patch.  The patch came out in 1991, '92.

Q.   And when the gum was available by

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=325
1746

prescription, it was available through pharmacies, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Mr. Rounds worked in the pharmacy at Halifax Hospital, correct?

A.   He did.

Q.   And you are aware that there have been various stop-smoking programs offered throughout the country by organizations such as the American Cancer Society and other public health groups, correct?

A.   Correct.  Lung Association and others as well, yes.

Q.   And Halifax Hospital was one the institutions that offered these types of stop-smoking programs, correct?

A.   I think that's correct.

Q.   And they did so at least as far as back as the early 1980s when Mr. Rounds started working at Halifax Hospital, correct?

A.   I don't recall that, but that sounds about right.

Q.   And you recall Ms. DeLucia's testimony that there were programs at Halifax Hospital with information about the dangers of smoking, correct?

A.   I think that's right, yes.

MR. HARRISON:  Can we put up ARA 14 03?  This

will be Defense Exhibit 3.

(Defense Exhibit 3 marked for

identification.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   This is a newspaper article from 1984 titled Local Puffers Urged to Stop.  Correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And the article says, Embry-Riddle Aeronautic University and Halifax Hospital are participating in the Great American Smokeout by setting up booths to distribute information on the health hazards of smoking and how to quit.  The hospital also had a, quote, smokers' patrol, made up of hospital auxiliary members circulating throughout the hospital and issuing citations to employees who were caught smoking. Did I read that correctly, sir?

A.   You did.

Q.   Now, you're familiar with the Great American Smokeout, correct?

A.   Yes.  It started in Minnesota.

Q.   In 1977, correct?

A.   Yes.  In Monticello.

Q.   And you know that there were a number of public service advertisements promoting the Great

1748

American Smokeout, correct? A.   True.

MR. HARRISON:  Can we play AN759?  This will be the Defense 4.

(Defense Exhibit 4 marked for identification.)

(Whereupon, a video clip was played in open court as follows:)

ED ASNER:  I'm Ed Asner.  The American Cancer Society has asked me to quit smoking, and I'm asking you to join me.  Now, don't panic; it's just for a day, November 16th.  That's the day they'd like every smoker in America to take a breather from cigarettes.  It won't be easy, but it's worth a try.  They figure if people can quit for a day, they just might quit for a lifetime. And that's what it's all about, a lifetime, yours and mine.

(Video clip concluded.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   And if we can -- you know those ads continued as the Great American Smokeout continued, correct? A.   Correct.

MR. HARRISON:  Can with we look at � this will be the Defense 5, D 5.

(Whereupon, a video clip was played in open court as follows:)

ED ASNER:  Hi, I'm Ed Asner.  Last year the American Cancer Society asked me to stop smoking, just for a day.  I said okay, but just for a day. That was November 16th.  Well, I got through it, so I tried it again on November 17th and 18th and 19th.  And you know, to this day I still haven't had a cigarette.  Why don't you try it.  Join the Great American Smokeout this November 15th.  Tell yourself just for a day.

MR. HARRISON:  Let's look at one more, AN3226, Defense 6.

(Defense Exhibit 6 marked for identification.)

(Whereupon, a video clip was played in open court as follows:)

SAMMY DAVIS JR.:  Giving up smoking comes easy for some people and hard for others.  If you're a smoker like me, try kicking the habit for just one day on Thursday, November the 17th. That's the date of the Great American Smokeout.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

This is Sammy Davis Jr. inviting you to join me along with a few million other Americans in making Thursday, November the 17th, truly a smokeless Thursday.  That means 24 hours, man, without one of these things.

(The video clip concluded.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, based on your review of the case materials, there is no evidence that Mr. Rounds ever participated in the Great American Smokeout, correct?

A.   No.  And I don't know that he saw any of these ads either.  So to participate in the Great American Smokeout, you don't necessarily sign up.  It's really a promotion to get people to try to stop smoking for a day, all that.  So that was the idea when it started in Monticello.

Q.   And based on your review of the case materials, there is no evidence that Mr. Rounds ever participated in the Great American Smokeout, correct?

A.   Well, he wouldn't have had to tell anyone. You can participate in this just by being part of the response to the ad campaign and to the news releases, and so on.  But we don't know whether or not he ever tried to stop smoking during the Great American Smokeout.

Q.   Dr. Hurt, in your deposition you were asked this question:  There is no evidence that he participated in the Great American Smokeout? Your answer was:  No.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, I object.  That's not impeachment; it's just what he said. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q. In addition to the Great American Smokeout, Halifax Hospital had others programs to help smokers quit smoking, correct?

BY MR. HARRISON:
	
Q.
	You've seen these advertisements before,

correct?
	We discussed them at your deposition.

A.
	I have seen them, yes.

Q.
	These advertisements range from 1982 to 1990,

correct?
	

A.
	That's correct.

Q.
	And Mr. Rounds worked in the pharmacy at

Halifax
	Hospital the entire period of time that these

articles
	are from, correct?

A.
	That's correct.

Q.
	Now, the first advertisement we have is for a

stop-smo
	king clinic at Halifax Hospital in April of

1982, correct?
	
A.
	I think that's right.

Q.
	Halifax Hospital was offering behavioral

modifica
	tion programs to help people stop smoking at

least as
	far as back as 1982, correct?

A.
	That's correct.

Q.
	And there is no evidence that Mr. Rounds ever

attended
	this stop-smoking program in 1982, correct?

A.
	And there is no evidence that he did or

didn't.

the other.

Q.   Sitting here today, there is no evidence that Mr. Rounds ever participated in that stop-smoking program in the 1982, correct?

A.   Nor is there any evidence that he did or did not.  There is just not any evidence.

Q.   If we go through, we have July of 1982, October of 1982, November of 1982, January of '84, September of '85, November of '85, January of '86, April of '87, September of '87, and August of 1990, correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   And to the best of your knowledge, based on your review of the records, Mr. Rounds never participated in any of these stop-smoking programs at Halifax Hospital, correct?

A.   There is no evidence one way or the other.

Q.   And you know that the family members who were deposed, you talked about Mr. Rounds' efforts to quit. Each of them describe what they recall Mr. Rounds doing to try to quit smoking, correct?

A.   Correctly.

Q.   And not a single witness mentioned that Mr. Rounds went to any of these programs, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Let's take a look at -- closer look at a few

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=333
1754

of these ads.

MR. HARRISON:  Can we have Dm 65 please? This is one the advertisements from. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   This is one of the advertisements September 8th, 1985, titled, "Eat well, exercise, don't smoke," correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And the second paragraph there that we have pulled out says, "Our health fitness department will offer a five-week stop-smoking program beginning at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, September 17.  Using American Lung Association guidelines, this program will teach you to manage the urge to smoke, motivate you to quit, and help you establish a new lifestyle." Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

MR. HARRISON:  Can we go to Dem 66, please. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   This is a another advertisement from November 1985 titled, "Take a Smoke Break at Halifax Hospital Medical Center," correct?

A.   That's what this says.

Q.   And it says, "Halifax Hospital Medical Center and WESH-TV Channel 2 want to help you stop smoking.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=334
1755

So together with Channel 2's weekly Smoking Breaks, Halifax Hospital is offering a stop-smoking seminar, Tuesday, November 19th.  Admission is free." Did I read that correctly?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you're aware of national programs like Channel 2's where TV stations would run series on quitting smoking, correct?

A.   There were those, yes.

Q.   And you didn't see evidence that Mr. Rounds participated in this "Smoke Break" at Halifax Hospital, correct?

A.   I didn't evidence one way or the other.  He could have a gone to the seminar without telling anyone, so I don't know if he did or did not, so there is no evidence one way or the other.

MR. HARRISON:  You can take that down. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   When we talk about what Mr. Rounds did or didn't do, you didn't see evidence that Mr. Rounds ever threw away his cigarettes in an effort to quit smoking, correct?

A.   I think there were people that were asked that question, and I don't think they -- anyone ever observed that, no.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=335
1756

Q.   Okay.  There is also no evidence that Mr. Rounds ever threw away his lighters or his ashtray in an effort to quit smoking, correct?

A.   That's the way the questions were asked and people answered that "no."

Q.   And you recall, as Mrs. Rounds testified, Mr. Rounds had one ashtray, correct?

A.   I don't know.  I just recall the ashtrays were always full, and that was what multiple people testified to.

Q.   You have the binder with Mrs. Rounds' deposition.  Can you turn to page 532, lines 22 through 25, please?

A.   532?

Q.   Correct.

A.   Okay.  532, line?

Q.   Twenty-two through 25, just read it to yourself, please.

A.   Yeah.

Q.   Does that refresh your recollection that Mrs. Rounds testified that Mr. Rounds had only one ashtray?

A.   So the question was, before:  To the best of your knowledge did he ever throw away all his ashtrays? I don't recall him throwing away all his

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=336
1757

ashtrays.  He had only had one, so -- and that was --she had got cut off with the next question, so I don't know what she was going to say.

Q.   Okay.

A. I just recall people, other people, talking about the ashtrays were always full, so I'm not sure where the ashtray was, but it was always full.

Q.   You didn't see the evidence that the ashtray was out in the man cave or Florida room we talked about?

A.   I don't -- I don't recall where that was.  I just recall people saying the ashtrays were always full.

Q.   Okay.  As far as quitting smoking, you recommended that smokers set a quit date, because setting a quit date can assist in quitting smoking, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   You didn't see any evidence that Mr. Rounds ever set a quit date in an effort to quit smoking, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   There is no evidence that Mr. Rounds himself ever sought professional help to quit smoking, correct?

A.   Well, Dr. Shelton, I would � Dr. Shelton,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=337
1758

apparently, was a very enlightened physician.  And he really, I think, was paying attention, obviously had a relationship with Mr. Rounds and talked with him about stopping smoke.  And I don't know.  I just answered the question probably too quickly about setting a date to stop.  I don't know that Dr. Shelton -- he may have set a date to stop; we just don't know that.  That would be the usual procedure.  If he knows enough to talk about behavioral modification, using nicotine patches, nicotine gum, he would have asked Mr. Rounds to set a date to stop, but we just don't have that in the record.

Q.   And we looked through the Dr. Shelton letter before, and we've talked about it.  And based on your review of the facts, it was Dr. Shelton who approached Mr. Rounds and encouraged him to quit smoking, correct?

A.   Well, that's what the letter kind of indicates, that they would conversations about this. His COPD, his emphysema was getting worse, and Dr. Shelton seemed like a very empathetic physician, a very astute clinician, and very interested in Mr. Rounds, which may reflect how well Mr. Rounds was followed around the hospital.  He, obviously, was a very good employee, a very good person.  And I think Dr. Shelton really was interested in him, not only as

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=338
1759

an employee, but as a human being.

Q.   Now, talking about Mr. Rounds's family, you saw that Mr. Rounds's mother was herself a smoker, correct?

A.   I recall that, yes.

Q.   And that she developed emphysema, correct?

A.   I think that's right.

Q.   And, in fact, she died of emphysema in 1992, correct?

A.   I can't remember the date, but I remember she died from a smoking-related disease.

Q.   And you recall that Mr. Rounds' mother quit smoking in 1982, correct?

A.   I don't recall that, but if you say that's true, I have no reason to doubt it.

Q.   And -- well, you recall Mr. Rounds' sister Nancy testifying that her mother quit smoking in 1982, correct?

A.   I think that's right, yes.

Q.   And you didn't see any evidence that Mr. Rounds asked his mother for help in quitting smoking, correct?

A.   Not that I recall, no.

MR. HARRISON:  Thank you, Your Honor.

Welcome back. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, let's change topics.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Let's talk about nicotine in cigarettes.  The fact that cigarettes contain nicotine has been known for a long time, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Nicotine has been known to be one of the components of tobacco since the 1800s, correct?

A.   Tobacco, but not cigarettes.  Cigarettes were not really an invention until the late 19th century and didn't become very popular until the 20th century, so nicotine in tobacco, but cigarettes are a 20th century phenomenon.

Q.   It has been known that nicotine has been one of the components of tobacco since the 1800s, correct?

A.   Actually, probably before then, but it was discovered in the 1800s, yes.

Q.   By a man named Jean Nicot, correct?

A

Q plant? A

Correct.

Nicotine occurs naturally in the tobacco

It does.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=341
1762

Q.   Just like caffeine occurs in coffee beans, correct?

A. Not exactly. I'm not sure where caffeine is formed in the coffee plant, but nicotine is formed in the roots of the tobacco plant.

Q.   Nicotine is put in the plant by Mother Nature, correct?

A.   It's a process of -- it's an agricultural product.

Q.   When a tobacco leaf is harvested from the field, it has nicotine in it and it can be addictive, correct?

A.   Well, some -- some tobacco plants have more nicotine than others, and so it depends on which variety and the growing season, and a lot of different factors go into how much nicotine is present and whether or not it will become addictive.

(A document was shown to the witness.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Hurt, if you could turn to page 2082.

A.   Twenty?

Q.   2082?

A.   2082?

Q.   Right.  Line 7.

A.   Okay.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=342
1763

Q.   And this testimony is from the Gordon trial just this past September, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you were asked this question:  When a tobacco leaf is harvested from the field, it has nicotine in it, and it can be addictive, correct? Your answer:  Yes. Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.  And you asked the same question before:  Put there by Mother Nature, correct?

By the growth of the tobacco plant, yes. So the same sort of questions.

Q.   Okay.  And every cigarette that has nicotine in it can be addictive, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Filtered and nonfiltered cigarettes can be addictive and dangerous, correct?

A.   They can be, yes.

Q.   Full-flavored and light or low tar cigarettes can also be addictive and dangerous, correct?

A.   Correct.  There's no safe cigarette.

Q.   Now, not only has it been known that nicotine is in tobacco, it has also been known for a long time that once someone starts to smoke it can be difficult to quit, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=343
1764

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Let's talk about some examples.  And, first, when Christopher Columbus and his sailors were going back to Europe, Columbus actually noticed that many of his men had a hard time giving up tobacco, correct?

A.   Well -- but that was tobacco; that wasn't cigarettes.  When Columbus got here, indigenous people were using tobacco, smoking it in pipes, cigars, and chewing it, but there were no cigarettes.  So what he observed was they took tobacco back to Europe, and that was the first Europeans that had seen tobacco.  But it wasn't -- it wasn't the refined modern cigarette.  It was a pretty crude product at that time, though he observed correctly that some people used it.

Q.   And he noticed that the crude product that the sailors were using, that some of them had a difficult time giving it up, correct?

A.   I think that's correct.

Q.   You are familiar with John Quincy Adams and Mark Twain, correct?

A.   I am.

Q.   John Quincy Adams was the sixth president of the United States?

A.   That sounds about right.

MR. HARRISON:  If we can have Dem 4, please.

And this is AIW00009.  It will be Exhibit I for

the record.  I realized my earlier mistake.  The

exhibits will not be Dl.  They will be A throuqh H

when they qo into evidence, so I apoloqize.  This

will be Exhibit I.

(Defense Exhibit I marked for

identification.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   You're familiar with the letter from John Quincy Adams to his minister, correct?

A.   I think it was a handwritten letter, as I recall.

Q.   And in the handwritten letter, John Quincy Adams notes, "In my early youth, I was addicted to the use of tobacco in two of its mysteries, smokinq and chewinq."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.  But he was smokinq -- we don't know if was he smokinq a pipe or smokinq a ciqar, but he wasn't smokinq ciqarettes because they didn't come about until much later.

MR. HARRISON:  If we can qo to Dem 5, please. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   You are familiar with Mark Twain's famous quote that "it's easy to quit smokinq; I know because

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=345
1766

I've done it thousands of times," correct?

A.   Correct.  But he was a cigar smoker, and he actually bought cigars by -- almost by the case.  He was a very heavy cigar smoker.  So this quote is what it is.  But he was not a cigarette smoker; he was a cigar smoker.

Q.   Let's talk about the cigarettes.

MR. HARRISON:  Can you put up Dem 6, AHL32,

Exhibit J.

(Defense Exhibit J marked for

identification.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   You are familiar with this document, correct, Dr. Hurt?

A.   I think I have seen it before, yes.

Q.   These are the official Florida Health Notes from 1906, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And you understand that the Florida Health Notes was the official publication of the Florida State Board of Health, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And what the Florida Health Notes said in 1906 is, quote, Today, the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the very worst form of tobacco

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=346
1767

addiction.

Did I read that correctly, sir? A.   You did.

Q.   That was the Florida Health Notes.  Let's go to the U.S. Surgeon General.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, before we go on, could we ask Mr. Harrison to read, for the rule of completeness, at page 10, "The Cigarette and the Boys"?

MR. HARRISON:  I don't know if that was the same one.

MR. WICHMANN:  Are you going to use it next? THE COURT:  So the rule of completeness doesn't apply because it's the wrong one?

MR. WICHMANN:  It's the next, so we will ask it the next time he uses it.  All right? MR. HARRISON:  Can we put up AWS54? BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   And you have seen this public health bulletin titled, Studies in vocational disease," correct? A.   I think so, yes.

Q.   And you understand that this was a report prepared at the direction of the U.S. Surgeon General, correct?

A.   It's from the Treasury Department.  I'm not

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=347
1768

sure that it's from the Surgeon General, but it's a study of the environment of workers.

Q.   If you look at the bottom, "Prepared by direction of the Surgeon General," correct?

A.   That's what it says, yeah.  I just didn't see that.

Q.   And it's from May of 1915, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And if we can turn to page 28, please.

1915, it is reported, quote, It is seen that cigarette smoking is by far the most popular form of tobacco addiction among male garment workers. Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

MR. HARRISON:  If you would take that down,

please, Will. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   You talked on direct about the 1988 Surgeon General's report.  Do you recall that?

A.   Yes.

MR. HARRISON:  Can we pull up the AS34,

please, page 10? BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Within the 1988 Surgeon General report, it's reported, quote, As early as the '20s and '30s, some

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=348
1769

investigators were concluding that nicotine was responsible for the compulsive use of tobacco products And then there are a number of sites from the '20s and '30s, correct?

A.   Correct.  There are four.

Q.   And then the next sentence says, Johnston, 1942, concluded that quote, smoking tobacco is essentially a means of administering nicotine, just as smoking opium is a means of administering morphine. Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   To paraphrase Dr. Johnston, he's talking about cigarettes as a nicotine delivery device, correct?

A.   If this is Dr. Johnston from the UK, that seems about right.  It's a paraphrase, yes.

Q.   And you know Dr. Johnston, correct?

A.   Well, I know of his work, yes.

Q.   You know of his work.  His work appeared in the journal called the Lancet, right?

A.   It did.

A very reputable journal, correct?

Correct.

A publicly available journal, correct?

It's a medical journal, so publicly available

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=349
1770

to the medical community.  I'm not sure if it's read by

people outside the medical community very much. Q.   Now, you showed a document on direct by

Dr. Teague using the phrase "sin qua non" in relation

to nicotine, correct? A.   Correct.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, I just want to make sure, if we're off this document, this time the following paragraph, in the interest of the rule of completeness, I would ask counsel to rule -- or to read starting with "the 1964."

MR. HARRISON:  The 1964 report of the U.S. Surgeon General's advisory committee on smoking and health held that, quote, the habitual use of tobacco is related primarily to psychological and social drives, reinforced and perpetuated by the pharmacological actions of nicotine on the central nervous system.  Nicotine-free tobacco or other plant materials do not satisfy the needs of those who acquire the tobacco habit.

MR. WICHMANN:  Thank you, counsel.

BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Talking about Dr. Teague, you mentioned sine

qua non.  It's also the document that talks about

nicotine being a delivery device, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=350
1771

A.   Correct.

Q.   Is it safe to say that document is from 1972? Correct?

A.   I think that's right, yeah.

Q. Is it safe to say that Dr. Johnston did not have Dr. league's memo when he wrote essentially the same thing in 1942?  Correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   In 1972, when Dr. Teague wrote this document, the public was aware that nicotine was in cigarettes, correct?

A.   Well, the public is a big -- a big group. I'm not sure how widely it was known.  As I think I mentioned on direct examination, the real seminal moment was the '88 Surgeon General's report when the medical community became very aware of nicotine addiction.  So I'm not sure.  When you say the public was aware, that's -- there are surveys that can show that, yes.  But I'm not aware of what date you are talking about.

Q.   It has been known for a long time that nicotine was the essential ingredient in smoke and that nicotine is the reason that some people smoke, correct?

A.   Well �

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor -- let me object,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=351
1772

Your Honor.  I think he misstates -- the question

is he -- it misstates the evidence.  He said

nicotine is the essential ingredient in smoke.  I

don't think that's what the evidence has been.  I

think he needs to rephrase the question.

THE COURT:  What were you quoting from?

MR. HARRISON:  I was just asking a question,

Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'll overrule then. THE WITNESS:  So can you say it again so I

can --BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   It has been known for a long time that nicotine was the essential ingredient in smoke, that nicotine is the reason that some people smoke, correct?

A.   You are obviously reading from something.  I don't know what the source is, but it's been known for some time -- a long time is relative -- that there's nicotine in tobacco.  But I'm not sure how widely it's known and how the nicotine transfer to smoke occurs and what things affected that, so --

Q.   Do you still have the Gordon testimony?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  If you can turn to page 2053.

A.   2053?  Okay.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=352
1773

Q.   Lines 16 through 20. A.   2053.  Okay. Q.   You were asked.

QUESTION:  It has been known by many for a long time that nicotine was the essential ingredient in smoke and that nicotine is the reason some people smoke.  We took a look at a few examples of that yesterday, correct?

ANSWER:  I think that's right. Is that correct, sir?  Did I read that correctly?

A.   Well yeah, but the question was, We took a look at a few of those examples yesterday, correct?

And I said, I think that's right, we did take a look at some of those examples yesterday.  So I'm not sure what the examples were.

So it goes on to talk about we looked at the '88 Surgeon General's report and some Reader's Digest. And so you are just refreshing what actually we looked at the day before.

Q.   Okay.  And this morning we looked at the '88 Surgeon General report regarding the studies in the '20s and '30s and Lennox Johnston, correct?

A.   Yeah.  We just did that a minute ago, yes. And I think there were four cited studies early on, so

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=353
1774

it wasn't -- it wasn't an encyclopedic by any stretch of the imagination, but there were sources, yes.

Q.   And moving away from the scientific journals, let's talk about slang in the early part of the 20th century.

You have heard the terms "nicotine fit" and "nicotine fiend," correct?

A.   I have.

Q.   And those terms traced back to the early part of the 20th century, correct?

A.   I think that's correct.

Q.   And those terms are descriptors of the difficulty it can be of quitting the effect of nicotine, correct?

A.   I don't know if they are descriptive.  They are pejorative, for sure.  They are really inappropriate, but that's what they are and that's what they were.  As I have just explained, you know, a nicotine fiend, you know, you have this image -- most people have the image of someone with long claws and fangs and acting erratically, and so on.  So I think "fiend" is a pretty bad term to put upon a person who is addicted to cigarette smoking.  So those were terms that were used, but I'm not sure how -- how well they described actually what was seen.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=354
1775

Q.   Now, as we move forward, let's take a pause and talk about Mr. Rounds.  He was described as someone who kept up on current events, correct?

Correct.

He read the newspaper every day?

I think that's correct.

Time magazine?

I think that's right.

He watched the news on television?

I think that's right.

He liked to watch Walter Cronkite and Harry

Reasoner, correct?

I think that's right.

He also listened to the news on the radio,

A.

Q. right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   You mentioned this, but you are, of course, familiar with Reader's Digest, correct?

A.   I am.

Q.   Reader's Digest was one of the most popular magazines in America in the '20s and '30s and '40s and '50s, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And in the days before the Internet and 24-hours news channels, Reader's Digest was one of the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=355
1776

prime sources from which the general public got information, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   It was read my millions of people in this country, correct?

A.   Correct, but I don't recall Mr. Rounds reading Reader's Digest.  He might have, but I don't know for sure.

Q. Do you recall that Mrs. Rounds testified that in the 1950s her family subscribed to Reader's Digest, correct?

A.   Something like that.

Q.   And she testified that she would read Reader's Digest, correct?

A.   I recall that, yes.

Q.   Now, beginning in the '20s and '30s, Reader's Digest ran articles regarding smoking and health, correct?

A.   They did.

Q.   They ran articles that described the health effects of smoking, correct?

A.   Well, to the extent that it was known, you know.  The '20s and '30s we were just beginning to see the health effects occur, because there is a latent period between the time a person starts smoking and

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=356
1777

they develop diseases.  It's usually 30 years or so. So the cigarette epidemic didn't really begin until 1914, and so 30 years later would be when we began to see the death and disability from that.  And so there were reports, but I'm not sure how extensive they were.

Q.   Reader's Digest during this time period, the '30s, '40s, '50s, also ran articles that described the addictive nature of smoking, correct?

A.   I recall seeing examples of that.

MR. HARRISON:  Okay.  Let's put up Dem 9,

please.  This would be Exhibit M. (Defense Exhibit M marked for

identification.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   This is Reader's Digest 1935 titled, I'm giving up smoking," correct?

A.   "I'm giving up smoking," yes.

Q.   And the article opens, "Of course, it is perfectly easy to give up smoking.  One would not like to think that one has become such a slave to tobacco that one cannot do without it, a drug which weakens the heart, damages the nerves, gives you cancer, and catarrh, and so on.  Personally I have given up smoking repeatedly."

Did I read that correctly?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=357
1778

A.   You did.  And I'm not sure.  It's from --condensed from Punch.  I'm not sure what Punch was.  It sounds like it's an article from some place else.  It doesn't say who this was, nor does it say cigarette smoking.  It just says "smoking."

Q.   It goes on -- and catarrh is a cough, right?

A.   Yes, it's a productive cough, coughing up mucus out of the lungs.

MR. HARRISON:  If we go to dem 10, please. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   This is the fourth paragraph.  Quote, Surely, you a rational being are not going to make yourself a slave to this drug.

Did I read that correctly?

A.   Well, that speaks to the addictive nature. Rationalization is part of this, so rationalization is in denial or part of the addictive process, so they are trying to make a case that a rational being wouldn't do this.  Well, that -- that tells us really about what they don't understand about nicotine addiction or tobacco dependence.

MR. HARRISON:  If we go to the next dem,

please. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   "The difficulty, in my mind, is not so much

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=358
1779

giving up smoking as going on giving it up." Did I read that correctly?

A.   Well, that is -- that's truly correct, that stopping smoking is part of the process, but maintaining the abstinence of smoking is the key. Relapse prevention is the key.  So when Mr. Rounds apparently stopped smoking sometime in 1992, when he missed all those appointments in September, my assumption is he relapsed.  So this is -- this is really pretty accurate about what we know about smoking even today, smoking cigarettes even today.

MR. HARRISON:  Let's go to 1941 in Dem 12,

please.  This will be Exhibit N.

(Defense Exhibit N marked for

identification.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Reader's Digest, 1941, "Nicotine Knockout or the Slow Count."  You're familiar with this article, correct?

I have seen it before, yes.

By Gene Tunney, right?

He was a heavyweight boxer.

He was not a scientist, right?

Not to my knowledge.

He talks about how he would fight Joe Louis

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=359
1780

if Joe Louis would start smoking, correct?

A.   He wasn't very bright either, so that's a different story.  I mean, that was probably -- he probably is bright, but fighting Joe Lewis would not be on my list of things to do.

Q. And he said he would fight Joe Louis if Joe Louis started smoking, right?

A.   I can't remember that.

MR. HARRISON:  Let's go to Dem 13 please. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q. Here Gene Tunney in Reader's Digest in 1941 says, "This powerful poison is the source of all the pleasure derived from smoking."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And you know based on your review of this article that he's talking about nicotine, correct?

A.   He's talking about nicotine.

Q.   The fact that nicotine was in cigarettes and that it was the derivation of the pleasure from smoking was published in Reader's Digest in 1941, correct?

A.   Yeah.  I think -- I think this was focused on cigarettes, but I could -- I could be wrong about this. It never says that.  It says smoking, and so they were smoking other things.  Like Mark Twain, people assumed

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=360
1781

that Mark Twain stopped smoking dozens of times or thousands of times.  But Mark Twain was not a cigarette smoker.  He was a pipe and cigar smoker, so I'm assuming this was a cigarette, but I'd have to go back and read that.

MR. HARRISON:  Let's go to 1944, Dem 14,

please.  This would be Exhibit 0. (Defense Exhibit 0 marked for

identification.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Reader's Digest, 1944, "Are You a Man or a Smokestack?"  You are familiar with this article, correct?

A.   I have seen it before.  I can't remember when.

Q.   The subtitle of the article is, "Confessions of a chain smoking David who slew the nicotine Goliath," correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   And the article says, quote, Now, after three years I can tell you the truth.  It really didn't hurt at all, and it didn't take any super exercise of willpower.  Anybody can do it.  I say flatly you can stop smoking if you really want to. Did I read that correctly?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=361
1782

A.   That's correct.  But I don't know who this person was.  A lot of things in Reader's Digest were written condensed from other articles, so I don't know who this -- this was certainly not a Gene Tunney, for sure.

MR. HARRISON:  You can take that down, Will. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   You have heard a song called "Smoke! Smoke! Smoke that Cigarette," correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   That was a very popular song in the 1940s, correct?

A.   I can't remember.  I didn't hear it because I wasn't listening to the radio in the 1940s, so --

Q.   People who did hear it, though, included --you have reviewed the testimony that Mrs. Rounds testified that she remembered the song "Smoke! Smoke! Smoke!," correct?

A.   I think that's right.

Q.   And the song, you know, was remade by a number of artists throughout the years, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   The song mentioned that you can puff yourself to death?

A.   Something like that.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=362
1783

Q.   And it also mentioned nicotine slaves, right? A.   It could be.

It ain't cuz I don't smoke myself, and I don't reckon that it'll harm your health. I smoked all my life, and I ain't dead yet.  But them nicotine slaves, they're all the same.  At a pettin' party or a poker game, everything gotta stop while they have a cigarette.

Q.   You are familiar with the Reader's Digest article "Nicotine, the Smoker's Enigma," correct?

A.   I think I have seen that yes.

Q.   And, again, Reader's Digest reports that nicotine is tobacco's characteristic ingredient, correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   It also notes, The primary action is in the central nervous system including the brain." Did I read that correctly?

A.   You read it correctly, but, you know, the central nervous system is the brain, not including the brain.

MR. WICHMANN:  Under the rule of

completeness, Your Honor, I would ask counsel to

read page 26.  We have a highlighted portion.

MR. HARRISON:  Reader's Digest also reports

it is, quote, It is imperative to point, says

pharmacological principles of medical practice,

that nicotine is a violent poison.

Did I read that correctly?  Is that all you

need?

MR. WICHMANN:  Yeah, that's fine. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   So we talked about earlier how nicotine was

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=365
1786

reported as being a poison.  Here it is being reported again in 1958 in Reader's Digest, correct?

A.   Okay.

Q.   Now, both these Reader's Digest articles, "How Harmful are Cigarettes" and "The Smoker's Enigma," are referring to nicotine as the essential or characteristic ingredient of tobacco and were written years before Claude Teague's memo, correct?

A.   They were.

Q.   Anybody who would have read Reader's Digest in this time could have read nicotine is the essential ingredient in tobacco, correct?

A.   They could have.  I recall a Teague article or report from the late '50s, so it's in the same -- so some of this is in the same time frame in the 1950s. And Teague started writing about this, as well as others, within the industry talking about the carcinogens and so on that didn't make the Reader's Digest at all.

Q.   Let's go to another magazine from 1958, Newsweek.  Newsweek, 1958, reports, "Smoking is a most serious sort of drug addiction and with a real psychological basis."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

MR. HARRISON:  And that would be Exhibit S.

Take that down.

(Defense Exhibit S marked for

Q.   Now, on direct you talked about a document from 1959 written by Dr. Alan Rodgman titled "The Optimum Composition of Tobacco and Smoke."  Do you recall that?

A.   I recall that, yes.

MR. HARRISON:  And if we can go to Dem 23,

please. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   He pointed out that -- Dr. Rodgman notes that of the polycyclic hydrocarbons that they found, eight of the polycyclic hydrocarbons isolated from the smoke are known to produce cancer in mice. Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

MR. HARRISON:  Can we go to Dem 24? BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Dr. Rodgman notes, "Having confirmed and extended the earlier published findings on polycyclic hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke, we initiated a lengthy research program to develop methods to lessen the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=367
1788

amounts of these potentially dangerous compounds in cigarette smoke."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   Now, Dr. Rodgman was an analytical chemist at Reynolds, correct?

A.   That is correct.

Q.   And he published a tremendous amount of scientific research particularly on the identification of constituents in cigarette smoke, correct?

A.   Well, "published," they are -- you have to be careful with that.  Some were published in the literature, but more often than not there were many more reports inside the companies than there were outside the companies.  So there's one document that talks about them being -- in fact, it's a Reynolds document that talks about the tip of the iceberg. Things that are in the public domain are the tip of the iceberg about what they actually knew.

Q.   Dr. Rodgman is cited in Surgeon General reports, correct?

A.   I think that's correct.  But what you said is that extensively published, and that's the part that I'm really not -- I would have to go back and look at his bibliography to see how extensively he published

MR. MILLARD:  I have got it.  Thank you. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Reader's Digest reports in November 1959, "Scientists are convinced that the primary carcinogens are the higher polycyclic hydrocarbons formed by the combustion of tobacco at high temperature, about 880 degrees centigrade in the cigarette ember.  They have identified eight carcinogenic polycyclics in tobacco smoke and are on the trail of others." Did I read that correctly? A.   You did, but it doesn't tell us which scientist.  That's one of the problems of Reader's Digest.  They make kind of blanket statements, and so there are no citations that I recall, no bibliography, so we don't know exactly who they are talking about. MR. HARRISON:  You can take that down, Will. MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, under the rule of completeness on that same page, I would like counsel to read the highlighted portion in the lower right-hand corner, please? MR. HARRISON:  These? MR. WICHMANN:  Yes.

MR. HARRISON:  "The compelling factor.  The tobacco industry will not admit publicly that it's seeking safer cigarettes.  Indeed, it continues to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=370
1791

deny that any tobacco health problems exist.  By

conceding that cigarettes can cause lung cancer,

the companies might leave themself wide open to

damage suits brought by the estates of cancer

victims who smoke particular brands." BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   On direct you showed an internal Reynolds document from 1963 where it's written that nicotine is addictive.  Do you recall that?

A.   Correct.

MR. HARRISON:  Can we pull up AIW2 64 9?  This

will be Exhibit U.

(Defense Exhibit U marked for

identification.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   This article is entitled, "Addictive Aspects in Heavy Cigarette Smoking," by Peter Knapp and others, correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   You are familiar with this article?

A.   I'm not sure.  I may have seen it, but I can't recall.  I can't recall the authors or where it was published.

Q.   Okay.

A.   It probably says there somewhere, but I --

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=371
1792

Q.   This article is from 1963 as well, correct?

A.   I don't know that for sure.  I can't see where the article came from, from this.

Q.   I will get the cite for you, I think if you go to the second page.

A.   I can't see.  At the top of it, it says what journal it is, but I can't read from what's on the screen.

Q.   You'll have to bear with me for one moment, Dr. Hurt.

A.   Okay.

Q.   I'll clear it up.

A.   Okay.  So there's the cover sheet.  That's the American Journal of Psychiatry.

Q.   Okay.  And it is from 1962, '63, correct?

A.   Yes, that's what it says.

Q.   Sorry for the confusion.  But the "Addictive Aspects in Heavy Cigarette Smoking" was published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 1963, correct?

A.   I'd have to go back and look.  I think that's what the quote said, yes.

Q.   And, of course, the American Journal of Psychiatry is not an internal tobacco company document, is it?

A.   That's correct.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=372
1793

Q.   It's a publicly available journal, right?

A.   It's available to the medical -- the medical public.  It's not, quote, publicly available in the sense that you are referring.  It's published.

Q.   Let's go to the conclusions page of the Knapp article, please.  In 1963 it is reported, quote, heavy cigarette smokers thus appear to be true addicts, showing not only social habituation but mild physiologic withdrawal effects.

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   So cigarette smokers are being referred to as addicts?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And there's even a mention of withdrawal, correct?

A.   Mild physiologic withdrawal.

MR. HARRISON:  Okay.  If we can go to the

first page, please. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   And you see this article was read at the 118th annual meeting of the American Psychiatry Association, Toronto, Canada, in 1962, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you see that this article was supported

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=373
1794

in part by grants from the American Cancer Society and the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   The American Cancer Society is a reputable organization, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you understand that the TIRC was funded by the tobacco companies including Reynolds, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   That's 1963.  That brings us to 1964.  The year 1964 was the release of the first Surgeon General's report on smoking and health, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   This was a landmark report, correct?

A.   It was.

Q.   It got massive publicity?

A.   It was -- a lot of publicity, yes.

MR. HARRISON:  If we could put up Dem 75,

please. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   This is an excerpt from the Surgeon General report.  And we know that the Surgeon General report in 1964 concluded that cigarette smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men, correct?

A.   Correct.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=374
1795

Q.   Now, you talked about this on direct a little bit.  But the 1964 Surgeon General report reached the conclusion that cigarette smoking should be referred to as a habituation, not an addiction, correct?

A.   That's what they concluded.

Q.   And in making the distinction between a habituation and an addiction in 1964, the Surgeon General applied the World Health Organization's classic definition of addiction at that time, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And part of the reason that cigarettes were not classified as addictive in 1964 is because the definition required that the drug be an intoxicant, correct?

A.   Well, that was one of the things, but there were other things that were required as well, societal versus individual harm.  So intoxication was part of it.  But I think I mentioned on direct that had they used the same classification for cocaine and amphetamines, they would have classified those as habituating not addicting, which, obviously, is not the case, nor has it ever been the case.

So they use the definition that six months later the World Health Organization did away with, and the Royal College of Physicians in England had already

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=375
1796

done away with that definition beforehand. Plus, there were cigarette smokers on the committee, and there were some that were very illustrious, very

academically-oriented people, as well.  So habituation versus addiction was part of the equation.  And their major conclusion, though, was that it caused lung cancer in men, and they got sidetracked on the other, and they were clearly wrong.

Q.   And I think what you explained -- I just want to make sure I heard you correctly -- that had the 1988 Surgeon General's report used the same definition as the 1964 Surgeon General's report, cigarettes would still not have been classified as addictive, correct?

A.   Correct.  And, actually, if they had used the definition six months later, they would have classified cigarettes as addicting even back in 1964, so -- and had they had access to the documents from your companies, it would have been clear that it was understood in 1962 and '63 that cigarettes were addicting, because that's what your documents said. But they chose not to make those available to the company -- or to the Surgeon General committee.

Q.   Let's look at this 1964 Surgeon General's report.

This is the Surgeon General's report on the

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=376
1797

characteristics of the tobacco habit, correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   And the Surgeon General's report in 1964 talks about, "Of the known chemical substances present in tobacco and tobacco smoke only nicotine has been given serious pharmacological consideration in relationship to the tobacco habit."  Correct?

A.   That's what it says.

Q.   And it goes on to say, "Lewin stated that the decisive factor in the effects of tobacco, desired or undesired, is nicotine."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yeah, but I'm not sure who Lewin was and what the context of that was, but that's what it says. You're right.  You've read it correctly.

Q.   And the bottom line, as we move away from this 1964 Surgeon General's report, is that we've known for a long time that some people can have a really hard time quitting smoking, correct?

A.   Well, "we've known for a long time," but that's -- that's kind of general.  It's been known for a long time that people have a hard time stopping smoking, yes.

Q.   And that's true whether you call it an addiction, a dependence, or a habituation, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=377
1798

A.   Well, we choose not to use the word habituation, because it trivializes how difficult this is.  It also doesn't speak to the brain changes that occur in people who are smokers, and that's what I've tried to explain on direct examination.  This is a biological phenomenon.  This is not just "willpower," "choice," or all those other words.  This is a very severe problem that's manifest by central nervous changes in the brain that are out of the control of the individual.

Q.   One more quote from the '64 Surgeon General's report.  In 1964, when the Surgeon General characterized cigarette smoking as habituating, it said, "Thus correctly designating the chronic use of tobacco as habituation rather than addiction carries with it no implication that the habit may be broken easily."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   Correct.  But, you know, again, the word "habituation" is the operative word here.  If you just were to substitute a word, Thus correctly designating the chronic use of cocaine as habituation rather than addiction carries with it no implication that the habit may be broken easily.  You just wouldn't do that.  You wouldn't put "cocaine" in there.  But that's what they

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=378
1799

would have done had they been talking about cocaine or amphetamines back in 1964, because they would have classified them as habituating, and you just wouldn't do that.

MR. HARRISON:  Your Honor, move to strike as

nonresponsive.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Now, that is 1964.  In 1994 you showed the testimony from the Waxman hearings, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   That was 20 -- over 20 years ago today?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you know, based on the review of the records we looked at, that Mr. Rounds had quit smoking by the time the Waxman hearings took place in 1994, correct?

A.   It was two years before he died, yes.  We assume -- we think he stopped smoking, but somewhere around that time he had stopped smoking.

Q.   We showed the testimony where Congressman Waxman was asking the executives some questions about whether they believe cigarettes are addictive, correct?

A.   It's actually Congressman Wyden from Oregon. It wasn't Congressman Waxman asking the questions.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=379
1800

Q.   You saw the congressman cut Mr. Johnston from R.J. Reynolds off, correct?

A.   Yeah.  Because he said "using the classic definition of addiction," which in 1994 was no longer operational.  So he tried -- he tried to go back to the '64 report saying the classic -- using the classic --Congressman, using the classical definition of addiction, I did not believe that cigarettes would be addicting.  So he wanted to go back and use the definition that had abandoned six months after the Surgeon General's report in 1964.  And he cut him off. MR. HARRISON:  I'd like to show now another

portion of Mr. Johnston's statement from that

proceeding, AN 3275.

(Whereupon, A video clip was played in open

court as follows:)

MR. JOHNSTON:  Good morning Mr. Chairman,

members of the subcommittee.

Again, I am Jim Johnston, Chairman and Chief

Executive Officer of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

Company.

I think the subcommittee should also be aware

that Dr. Kessler's definition of addiction would

classify most coffee, cola, and tea drinkers as

addicts, caffeine addicts.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=380
1801

Many people experience a strong urge for a cup of coffee each morning and there is a well-documented physical withdrawn syndrome associated we the consumption of coffee and caffeinated soft drinks.  Nonetheless, I you seriously doubt that the American public would say that these characteristics put caffeine in the same class as addictive drugs such as cocaine and heroin.

During the past several years, there have been a wide variety of attempts to convince the American public that cigarettes are addictive and that some public officials have even gone so far as to put cigarettes in the same class as cocaine and heroin.

You don't need to be a trained scientist to see this isn't true.  All you need to do is ask and honestly answer two simple questions.

First, would you rather board a plane with a pilot who just smoked a cigarette or one with a pilot who just had a couple of beers or snorted cocaine or shot heroin or popped some pills?

Second, if cigarettes were addictive, could almost 43 million Americans have quit smoking, almost all of them on their own without any

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=381
1802

outside help?

The answers are obvious, and that is precisely my point.  Cigarettes are clearly not in the same class as addictive, mind-altering drugs like heroin and cocaine.

I agree that for some people cigarette smoking is habit forming in the same way that other pleasurable activities, such as watching TV, eating your favorite foods, sometimes overeating your favorite foods, and drinking coffee can be habit forming.  And yes, some smokers find it difficult to quit.  But there is nothing about cigarette smoking that prevents a person from clearly thinking and making reasoned decisions, including the decision to quit. (Video clip concluded.)

BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   I would like to talk now about the warning

labels.  You mentioned them.  Starting in 1966, every

pack of cigarettes sold in the United States carried

the Surgeon General's warning, correct? A.   It did.

Q.   1966 to 1979, the label on the pack of every

pgNbr=382
1803

cigarette said, "Caution:  Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health," correct?

A.   Yes.  And the operative word there is "may." I mean, that's -- we know that they said in 1964 that cigarettes were causally related to lung cancer.  So, I mean, I can't think of -- lung cancer is certainly hazardous to your health.  And the fact that they put "may" in there as a qualifier was part of the political process at the time.

MR. HARRISON:  Let's go to 1970, Dem 34,

please. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   The 1970 warning on the side of every pack of cigarettes read, "Warning:  The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoke is dangerous to your health," correct?

A.   And the operative word there is now "is" rather than "may."  So between the middle '60s to 1970, then there was more evidence, and they strengthened the warning a little bit.

Q.   This warning in 1972 went on every cigarette advertisement, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   It went on every carton of cigarettes?

A.   Correct.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=383
1804

Q.   And it went on every pack in every carton, correct?

A.   I think that's right.

MR. HARRISON:  Let's go to 1985.  Dem 35,

please. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   These are the warnings put on the sides of cigarette packs in 1985, correct?

A.   They changed it to four rotational warnings, yes .

Q.   And the "Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risk to your health," correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you agree with that, correct?

A.   I do.  Cigarettes are the only product that you can name that causes over 60 percent of the smokers to die of a tobacco-caused disease.  So stopping smoking really does help that yes.

Q.   Surgeon General's warning:  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy," correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   These warnings and the ones before them went on every type of cigarette, correct?

A.   Right.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1805

Q.   They went on filtered cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   They went on light cigarettes or low tar cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And on every cigarette sold in the United States, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Now, while we're talking --

A.   And the warnings haven't changed for 30 years.  So the last time this has changed was 1985, and there was a proposal --

MR. HARRISON:  Your Honor, Your Honor,

there's no question pending.  It's nonresponsive. THE COURT:  All right.  Sustained.  Go ahead

and ask the next question. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   While we are talking about filtered and light cigarettes, you mentioned on direct some testimony from Mrs. Rounds and others about what Mr. Rounds may have believed about filtered and light cigarettes. Do you recall that testimony?

A.   I do.

Q.   Now, based on your review of the case-specific materials, there is no evidence as to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=385
1806

where Mr. Rounds got that information, correct?

A.   No. But he -- several people testified to the fact that he thought that filtered cigarettes were better or less hazardous.  And there is testimony from various people that light cigarettes were, quote, safer, and he dissected -- I think I recall him dissecting one of the cigarettes showing his wife that all of the brown stuff is captured in the filter.  So the tobacco companies are doing their job to make these less harmful.  That's what I remember.

Q.   Mrs. Rounds testified she does not recall Mr. Rounds ever telling her the tobacco told her --told him that filtered cigarettes were safer, did he?

A.   Well, that was the question that was asked.

Q.   And her answer was, No, he never --

A.   Well, yeah.  But the question -- in the context of that question, I don't know where that question was in the context of her deposition.  Her deposition spanned three volumes, so it could have been in the middle of something.

Q.   Mrs. Rounds also testified that she doesn't recall Mr. Rounds ever telling her that a tobacco company told him that light cigarettes were safe, correct?

A.   Correct.  But at the time all this was

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=386
1807

occurring, it was pervasive.  Light cigarettes were everywhere and that's -- he interpreted this as --

MR. HARRISON:  Your Honor, move to strike as speculative.

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, he asked the question.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  So he got the information from somewhere, and the information was in the public -- was in the true public domain and news -- news articles and advertisements, and so on.  So he perceived, just like other people that switched to light and low tar and low nicotine cigarettes, they perceived it to be safer.  And that's what we experience when we talk to the patients.  And to quote from the industry, it was health reassurance, to reassure the public that they had done something to make the product safer. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   When we get to Mr. Rounds' actual smoking --A.   Pardon me?

Q.   When we get to Mr. Rounds' actual smoking filtered cigarettes, there is no evidence in the record that he smoked them any differently than he did his unfiltereds, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=387
1808

A.   I don't know.  He seemed like he smoked more later.  And what we know about Vantage in particular, it was a lower nicotine and lower free nicotine levels compared to Winston, Winston Lights.  And I don't know if he smoked -- it seemed like he smoked more later in his life than he did earlier, so he may have compensated, but I don't think we have anyone saying directly that he inhaled deeper or holds his breath longer, which is what I think you were asking.

Q.   Now, you have mentioned various statements that were out in the public, and you have reviewed the deposition testimony in this case.  And you talked about The Tobacco Institute, and you showed a press release.

There is no case-specific evidence that Mr. Rounds ever heard, saw, or read anything from The Tobacco Institute, correct?

A.   Well, that's the way the question was asked, and I don't think one of -- one that was asked of Mrs. Rounds and at least one or two of the children, I think they answered, No, we don't have any evidence of that.

Q.   Now, the same would be true for the Council for Tobacco Research, or CTR, correct?

A.   I think that's the same -- they didn't know

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=388
1809

what that was.  So whether or not he qot information from that, no one will ever know.

Q.   And there is no case-specific evidence that Mr. Rounds ever heard, saw, or read anythinq from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, or TIRC, correct?

A.   I think the same answer, that that was the way the question was asked, and the answer was no, not to their knowledqe.

Q.   And based on your review of the materials, there is no case-specific evidence that Mr. Rounds ever heard, saw, or read anythinq that R.J. Reynolds said about smokinq and health, correct?

A.   I don't -- I think that was the way the question was asked, and the answer from the people that were asked that was no.

Q.   And the same would be true for any other tobacco company, correct?

A.   I think that's probably correct.  We just don't know the answer to that.

Q.   Now, you talked about use of ammonia and pH on Friday.  Do you recall that testimony?

A.   I do.

Q.   Now you are aware that ammonia does occur naturally in tobacco, correct?

A.   It does.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=389
1810

Q.   And when ammonia is used in -- ammonia compounds in tobacco, one of the things it does is it releases natural pectins in tobacco and helps it stick together, correct?

A.   That's helping to make the reconstituted tobacco, make the sheet of tobacco, so it releases pectins which bind together -- bind together so you can make a sheet of paper for the reconstituted tobacco. That's one of the things it does, yes.

Q.   One of the other things ammonia does is it can be a flavor characteristic as well, right?

A.   That's what is talked about a lot, yes.

Q.   Now, you agree that the methods for measuring smoke pH were not a secret internal to the tobacco companies, correct?

A.   I think that's correct.

Q.   People knew how to measure smoke pH, correct?

A.   Correct.

MR. HARRISON:  And can we show AIW3489? BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   In fact, this is an article titled "A New Technique for Determining the pH of Whole Tobacco Smoke," published by Drs. Sensabaugh and Cundiff for the research department of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=390
1811

A.   That's what it says.  But I don't know what the journal is or what it was.

Q.   You see there --

A.   Tobacco Science, yes.

Q.   From February of 1967, correct?

A.   Correct.

MR. HARRISON:  You can take that down. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   You talked about the publicly available documents available today, and you have told us you reviewed thousands -- you've reviewed thousands of company documents, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   There are millions of documents available, I think is what you said now, correct?

A.   Well, there were 33 million as a result of Minnesota, but there are now 70 million pages of previously secret tobacco industry documents.

MR. HARRISON:  Let's take a look at one of

those, AS173.  For the record the last exhibit

would be Exhibit X.  This will be Exhibit Y. (Defense Exhibits X and Y marked for

identification.) BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   This is a memo from A.H. Galloway to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=391
1812

Dr. Murray Senkus in 1968, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you have seen this document before, correct?

A.   Well, probably.  I just don't recall the exacts.  But I'm sure you are going to show me, so I may have seen it.

Q.   And you have put up the organizational charts to show who people were.  Dr. Senkus is the head of R&D at R.J. Reynolds?

A.   He's the director for research, yes.

Q.   And A.H. Galloway was the president of R.J. Reynolds, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   So this is a memo from the president of the company to the head of the research department in 1968, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   If we can go to page 3.  Areas of special emphasis.

1.  In cooperation with others, you should push the work concerning tobacco and health.  You should prepare a plan to foster any relationship with government personnel in the quest for mutual understanding of facts, ultimately to gain their

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=392
1813

corporation in proper research of the subject.

2.  If there is a safer cigarette let's continue and increase our efforts in this program. Please -- please prepare a plan to carry it out. Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   Now, you can take that down.

On direct you also showed a document from Dr. DiMarco, who talked about developing -- the possibility of developing new products, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   You know Dr. DiMarco became the head of research of R.J. Reynolds in 1982, correct?

A.   That's about right, yes.

Q.   And he continued to be the research director thereafter, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   You are familiar with a product by R.J. Reynolds called Premier, correct?

A.   Correct.

MR. HARRISON:  And can we have dem 77, please? BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   And what -- Premier is not a traditional cigarette, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=393
1814

A.   Well, no.  But it's called a cigarette by Reynolds, because if they didn't call it a cigarette, then it would be regulated.  So it was called a cigarette, though it was a device to heat the tobacco and not burn it.

Q.   And that's the distinction I was trying to make.  A conventional cigarette Winstons, Marlboros, they burn tobacco, correct?

A.   Correct.  But they called it a cigarette because had they not called it -- it's a drug delivery device is what it is.  Had they not called it a cigarette it would have been regulated.  So they called it a cigarette, they marketed it as a cigarette, and it never was a cigarette.

So the definition of a cigarette is tobacco wrapped in paper.  And that's the definition they tried to use for this product, which was -- it's clearly not, not a cigarette.

Q.   Premier heated, not burned tobacco, right?

A.   It did.  But they called it -- your company called it a cigarette to avoid regulation.

Q.   And by -- and the bad compounds from cigarette smoking are generated when you light and burn the cigarette, correct?

A.   Some of them are, yes.  There are tobacco

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=394
1815

specific nitrosamines that can come from tobacco without burning it.  And tobacco specific nitrosamines can cause cancer.

Q.   Now, you are aware that Reynolds spent a billion dollars developing Premier, correct?

A.   I don't know how much it was, but it was a fairly large amount of money.

Q.   And you know Premier was launched in 1988, correct?

A.   I don't remember the date, but it was around that time, yes.

Q.   Now, you know that there were a number of studies regarding Premier, correct?

A.   There were.

Q.   And in fact, R.J. Reynolds published a monograph on Premier, right?

MR. WICHMANN:  Your Honor, I'm going to

object.  This is way outside the scope of direct.

And this monograph and this area of examination is

irrelevant.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   Reynolds published a monograph on Premier, correct?

A.   They did.  And it's filled with glossy

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=395
1816

pictures and all kinds of things about why this would be a safer device.

Q.   You are familiar with this monograph, right?

A.   I am.

Q.   And you know it was given to people outside to review the science and the studies that were conducted on Premier, correct?

A.   I think that's correct.

Q. And what the studies showed, you know there was Ames testing done on Premier, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And what it showed is that Premier reduced the carcinogens as compared to a conventional cigarette, correct?

A. It reduced them, is the operative word. It did not eliminate them, just because -- just because nitrosamines are present in tobacco, period.

And the other thing that was shown with Eclipse is if you take the little cartridge out, you can add whatever kind of drug you want to to it and smoke it.  And that's one of the reasons that it never -- never became very popular.

Q.   The monograph and the scientist who reviewed it determined that Premier was safer than conventional cigarette smoking as it relates to lung cancer,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=396
1817

correct?

A.   I don't think that that has ever been proven, because it takes a long time to prove that, it takes epidemiologic studies over a period of 20 or 30 years, and that product never was used long enough to make that statement.

What they did show was that it had less Ames activity, which is taking the condensate from it and painting it on the backs of a mouse and seeing if it caused cancer.  And it was less so than a conventional cigarette.  But whether or not it would have been a product that would have reduced lung cancer, we'll never know, because those studies were never done.

Q.   Let's -- let's change gears and talk about nicotine in the body.  You mentioned on direct smoking caused a release of dopamine, correct?

A.   That among -- and other things.  But we think about dopamine as being one of the main neurotransmitters.

Q. And dopamine is, I think as you explained, a chemical found naturally in everyone's brain, smokers and nonsmokers, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   There are lots of things that stimulate release of dopamine, right?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=397
1818

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Caffeine triggers the release of dopamine?

A.   It can.

Q.   Chocolate can release dopamine?

A.   It can.

Q.   A nice meal can release dopamine?

A.   It can.

Q.   Watching a funny movie, having sex.  Any time you do something pleasurable, you can release dopamine, correct?

A.   That is part of the mediation of pleasure, yes .

Q.   Now, when we talk about a smoker and when they quit, the nicotine in their bloodstream is gone in about 10 hours, correct?

A.   The half life of nicotine is 120 minutes, so it takes about five half lives for it to go to close to zero.  So that would be about 10 hours would be most people.  Some people, it would be a little more, some less, but that's about right.

Q.   And the nicotine is completely gone from the body in about 72 hours, correct?

A.   It would be, yes.

Q.   About three days, right?

A.   Well, actually, it's probably almost all gone

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=398
1819

within a day.  But --

Q.   Now you talked about nicotine receptors and, I think you discussed this, and I just want to make sure we're clear.  Everyone has nicotinic -- nicotine receptors in their brain, right?  Smoker and nonsmokers?

A.   Everyone has acetylcholine receptors in their brain, and they become known as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, because nicotine can activate them.  But the real, real term is acetylcholine receptors.

Q.   And you talked about how the up-regulation occurs when someone is smoking cigarettes, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And I think you mentioned this, but to be clear, when a person stops smoking, the receptors begin down-regulating, correct?

A.   They do.

Q.   The up-regulation that occurs when someone is smoking reverts to down-regulation, correct?

A.   Well, the up-regulation is maintained by the high concentrations of nicotine that people get from cigarette smoking.  We don't know that the up-regulation is maintained by other delivery methods like patches or gum, but certainly cigarette smoking maintains the up-regulation.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=399
1820

Q.   And I think when you told us, and to be clear, after a person quits smoking, the number of receptors actually goes down to normal within a few months, correct?

A.   The best we know, it's around three months or so it will go back to normal.  But as I mentioned on direct, these receptors do not forget.

MR. HARRISON:  Can I have the ELMO, please? BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   And I think this is what you were talking about on your direct, right?  Indelible memory evoked by cravings, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Now, when you put up your slide of the --your DSM analysis of Mr. Rounds, you noted the categories that you believed he fulfilled, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And the two -- of the two categories you find -- that you did not find that Mr. Rounds met included craving or a strong desire or urge to use tobacco, correct?

A.   Correct.  But that's the problem with DSM, is you have to ask the -- be able to ask the person the question.  So no one reported that in any of the depositions that he had craving.  But you would have to

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=400
1821

be able to ask that question.

Q.   And when we talk about when someone quits smoking, there are -- some people can experience withdrawal symptoms, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you agree that people can stop smoking without having withdrawal symptoms, correct?

A.   It's -- it can be done, but most people who are daily smokers are -- have some level of dependence, will have some level of withdrawal.  Whether or not you can measure it is a different question.

Q. And I think this is your point. The level of the severity of the withdrawal differs from individual to individual, correct?

A.   It does.

Q.   And for people who do have withdrawal symptoms, those withdrawal symptoms peak within a few days, correct?

A.   They do.

Q.   And the classic withdrawal symptoms will typically last between 14 and 21 days, correct?

A.   Yeah, about that, yes.

Q.   So for most people, from a few days to a few weeks, the classic withdrawal symptoms go away, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=401
1822

A.   Correct.

Q.   Now, when you did -- when you reached your opinions in this case, you told us that you used the Heaviness of Smoking Index?

A.   Correct.

Q. And I think you discussed this a little bit, but you see that scoring for the Heaviness of Smoking Index is on the bottom there, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And there is no set of answers a smoker could give to the Heaviness of Smoking Index and not come out with at least a low level of dependence, correct?

A.   That's correct.  Because you usually administer this to people who are almost always daily smokers, and they would always have some questions that would be answered to be low dependence.  And so that's -- you wouldn't administer --

This would be like if a man came into your office with a protruding abdomen, you wouldn't order a pregnancy test.  You would only give this test to people who are -- who are smokers.

Q.   If you gave, if you analyzed somebody who smokes a single cigarette after dinner under the Heaviness of Smoking Index, they would come out at least with some level of dependence, correct?

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=402
1823

A.   Well, some.  It would be zero, close to zero. Q.   Now, you talked about the DSM, and you showed us your DSM analysis.

MR. HARRISON:  Can we pull up 573 of the DSM? BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   "As far as measuring dependence, DSM reports that the prevalence among current daily smokers is approximately 50 percent."

Did I read that correctly? A.   You did.

MR. HARRISON:  And you can take that down, Will. BY MR. HARRISON:

Q.   You agree that not everyone who smokes is addicted, correct?

A.   I think most daily smokers would be classified as being addicted, based upon --

So again, the DSM is really flawed in many respects, one of which is it doesn't use time to first cigarette, it does not use how much they smoke at all, and uses these other criteria that are in the 11 different -- 11 different things.  So most of us in the field think that they should have included both time to first cigarette and how much do you smoke as part of the criteria, which would then change the results of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=403
1824

that prevalence data.

Q.   Putting aside the DSM.  In your opinion, you agree that not everyone who smokes is addicted, correct?

A. Most daily smokers, -- and I can't give you the precise number -- most daily smokers would be --would be -- have some level of addiction.

Q.   Which means that there are people who did not -- who are not addicted, correct?

A.   I'd have to -- I'd have to give a specific answer, specific question or specific person to be able to answer that question.

Q.   There are people who smoke and do not become addicted, correct?

A.   We call those people chippers, and they are infrequent but regular smokers.  So not daily smokers, smoking fewer cigarettes on an intermittent basis. They would be called chippers.  And that "chipper" term comes from the heroin literature, because people can do the same thing with heroin.

Q.   Doctor, you agree that not even regular smokers, that not at all regular smokers are addicted, correct?

A.   No.  Actually, what I just said earlier is that people who are daily smokers I would think would

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=404
1825

have some level of dependence.

(A document was shown to the witness). Q.   Dr. Hurt, you recall testifying in the Perrotto?

A.   Vaguely.  It's 2014.  Yeah.

Q.   Can you please turn to page -- to line 2212, page 2212, lines 13 through 17?

A.   I'm having trouble finding it.  Okay.  2212. Q.   2212, line 13 through 17.  You were asked:

QUESTION:  There are people who smoke and who don't become addicted, right, Doctor? ANSWER:  That's true.

QUESTION:  Even though they are regular smokers, yes?

ANSWER:  They can be, yes. Did I read that correctly? A.   You did.

Q. You agree that not all smokers who smoke lots of cigarettes over a long period of time are addicted, correct?

A.   No.  Again, I -- my feeling is that people who are daily smokers, almost all of them will be --have some level of dependence.  So the operative word here is "regular smokers."  Chippers are also regular smokers, they just do it infrequently.

(A document was shown to the witness)

Q.   Do you recall testifying in the Bowden trial?

A.   Yes.

Q.   If you could turn to page 1673, please.

A.   1673.  Okay.

Q.   Lines 22 through 24.  You were asked:  In fact, not all smokers who smoke lots of cigarettes over a long period of time are addicted? ANSWER:  That's correct. Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   Now, Doctor, you have never told people who came to your clinic, don't bother trying, you can't quit smoking, correct?

A.   No.

Q.   And that makes sense because -- just because a person is addicted doesn't mean they can't quit smoking, correct?

A.   That's a double negative, but that's correct.

Q.   People who are addicted, quit; people who aren't addicted, quit.  Correct?

A.   Well, most of the people we see in the clinic are dependent, and daily smokers are going to be dependent.  So people who are addicted can stop smoking, yes.

1827

Q.   Even heavily addicted smokers can quit smoking, correct?

A.   They can.

Q.   Smokers have the ability to decide whether they are going to try to quit, don't they?

A.   Well, as I said earlier if you have a heart attack, that's not deciding.  You just happen to --

Q.   When we talk about quitting, you explained on direct with Mr. Wichmann, what the -- how the government calculates the quit rates of smokers.  I just want to go through and make sure we all understand what the figures are.

A.   It's not quit rates.  It's really defining smokers.  So we talk about quit rates in a whole different way than the way the questions are asked for the population of smokers.

Q.   Between 1966, when the first warnings went on the cigarette packs, and 1970, 13 million Americans quit smoking, correct?

A.   Well, like I said earlier, more than that quit smoking, because that doesn't count the number of people who died from cigarette-caused diseases, because all of them stopped smoking too.  So from 1965 to -- or '64 to 2014, we're talking about 25 million or so people who were smokers died, dying of a tobacco-caused

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1828

disease.  So the way you say the question is a low estimate for what actually happened.

Q.   Between 1966, when the warnings first went on cigarette packs, and 1970, 13 living -- 13 million living American smokers quit smoking, correct?

A.   The operative word there was "living."  And you got it right the second time, yes.

Q.   By 1979, that number had grown to 30 million former smokers, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Today there are upwards of 60 million ex-smokers alive in the United States, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Between 1 and 2 million Americans quit smoking every year, correct?

A.   Correct.  A small percentage of those who tried to stop.

Q.   I think that translates into roughly 3,000 people quitting smoking each day in the United States, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Today there are more former smokers than current smokers, correct?

A.   Correct, using those definitions we talked about on direct testimony.

Q.   Doctor, let's --

MR. HARRISON:  Can we pull up ATS 7371? BY MR. HARRISON:

Q. This is the Mayo Clinic, My Path to a Smoke-Free Future. You are familiar with this document, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   This is a manual that's used in the Mayo Clinic for patient care, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   You helped develop this manual, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you stand behind the information that's within it?

A.   I do.

Q.   Can we turn to page 10, please?

Making the decision.  You write, Only you can decide when to quit smoking.

Did I read that correctly?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And then if we could turn to page 6, please. You provide in this pamphlet or manual, is you outline a number of things that happen when people quit smoking, correct?

A.   Correct.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=409
1830

Q.   Before we go through this, I want to ask you a couple questions about lung cancer.  First, you agree that most smokers do not develop lung cancer, correct?

A.   About 15 percent of smokers develop lung cancer.

Q.   And you agree that nonsmokers can develop lung cancer, correct?

A.   A small number, almost all from secondhand smoke exposure.

Q.   How much cigarette smoking does it take to increase the person's risk of lung cancer?

A.   Well, no one really knows for sure.  It's usually related to when they started smoking.  And so the length of smoking is almost as predictive as how much they smoke.  So that's kind of the newest information about that.  So long, longer-term smoking is related to development of lung cancer, as is how much they smoked.

Q.   Is it -- is there a level of smoking at which you have no risk of developing lung cancer from smoking?

A.   Probably not, because even with secondhand smoke, we know that 3,000 people every year who are never-smokers exposed to secondhand smoke develop lung cancer in this country every single year.  Worldwide,

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=410
1831

it's much more than that.

Q.   Let's go back to talking about when you quit smoking.  Now, you agree that when a smoker quits smoking, his or her risk of developing a smoking-related disease goes down over time, correct?

A.   It does.

Q.   That's one of the many reasons you encourage your patients to quit smoking, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   This pamphlet states that 20 minutes after you quit smoking, your heart rate drops, correct?

A.   It does.

Q.   Twelve hours after quitting, the carbon monoxide level in your blood drops to normal, correct?

A.   Well, it actually -- this is an older version, so it's actually longer than that.  The half life of carbon monoxide is four to six hours, so it's somewhere in that range, would be 12 to 15 hours or so

Q.   So instead of 12, we'll go 12 to 15 hours after quitting?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   Fair enough?

A.   Fair enough.

Q.   Two to three, two weeks to three months after quitting, your heart attack risk begins to drop, your

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=411
1832

lung function begins to improve, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   One to nine months after quitting, your coughing and shortness of breath decrease?

A.   It can.

Q.   One year after quitting, your added risk of coronary heart disease is half that of smokers, correct?

A.   And we've revised that.  It's actually the risk of having a heart attack.

Q.   Five to 15 years after quitting, your stroke risk is reduced to that of nonsmokers, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And 10 years after quitting, your lung cancer death risk is about half that of nonsmokers, correct?

A.   Correct, but the risk never goes back to that of a never-smoker.

Q.   The longer you quit, the less likely you are to develop lung cancer?

A.   Correct.  But the longer you live -- so it's a curve that never goes down -- it continues to go up as you continue to age, even though you've stopped smoking a long time ago, compared to a never-smoker.

Q.   As we talk about quitting smoking, we've looked at a few PSAs here, you know that there were

THE COURT:  Come on up.

MR. WICHMANN:  The question of timing.

(At the bench.)

MR. WICHMANN:  This it the time of our usual lunch break, but I know Dr. Hurt has a 2 o'clock flight, and I'd just like to try to get an idea from Mr. Harrison how long he thinks his cross-examination is going to go, because I have to get my staff working to get him on a later --later flight if he's going to continue.

MR. HARRISON:  I will do two public service announcements, and we will let him go, if that works for you.

MR. WICHMANN:  Two?

MR. HARRISON:  Two public service announcements, and I'll be through.  Then we will let him go.

MR. WICHMANN:  I only need probably 10 minutes in redirect.  So can we hold the jury a little bit longer?

MR. HARRISON:  Before I introduce the next exhibit, let me roll the two public service announcements that we talked about.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. HARRISON:  This will be Exhibit AA. (A video clip was played for the jury as follows:)

MR. HAGMAN:  Do you know what would happen if you stopped smoking cigarettes right now, right this minute?  I'll tell you what would happen. Your lungs would immediately start to repair themselves.  Even if you've been smoking for years and years, once you stop assaulting your lungs, it's only a matter of time before they are healthy and in the pink again.  Now you have every reason in the world to stop smoking cigarettes, because now you know what will happen if you do, and what will happen if you don't.

statement by The Tobacco Institute, Doctor.

MR. HARRISON:  Can I see a copy, please? MR. WICHMANN:  Sure. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   I'll ask you some questions about this?

A.   Okay.

MR. WICHMANN:  And I think I'll put it on the

ELMO.  Dan, can we have some power here? BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Okay.  Doctor, this is PT 6182.  It's a statement by The Tobacco Institute.  And tell -- would you just refresh the jury, what was The Tobacco Institute?

A.   Well, The Tobacco Institute was the main lobbying and public relations arm for all of the cigarette manufacturers.

Q.   Okay.  Could you read the first paragraph that's highlighted there, please?

A.   We hear that once again the American Cancer Society is orchestrating its annual so-called, quote, Smokeout, end quote, stunt.

Q.   And the next.  Go ahead.  The next highlighted.

A.   It will surprise no one that we view the effort with a jaundiced eye, but the reason may be of

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

1837

some interest.  First, the American Cancer Society again misleads the public with its tunnel vision on the cancer problem.

Q.   Okay.  Stop right there.  Is one of the --what is the purpose of the American Cancer Society?

A.   To prevent and treat cancer.

Q.   Have you ever known the American Cancer Society to mislead the American public?

A.   No.

Q.   Would you please read the second paragraph to the jury, or the highlighted portion on the second page?

A.   What every individual does need from every possible source is factual information to use in making his or her own judgments.  It's quite clear that the American Cancer Society has no intention to meet that need.

Q.   Did R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company provide smokers with factual information from every possible source concerning the hazards of smoking while Terry Rounds was alive?

A.   No.  In fact, they did exactly the opposite. They misled the public.

Q.   Is this document an example of R.J. Reynolds cooperating with the Great American Smokeout?

Could you put up 64, please?

Showing the stop-smoking programs available from the Halifax Hospital.  Do you recall that? A.   Yes.

Q.   What is the date of those slides, Doctor? A.   From 1982 through 1990. Q.   Was that during the time that the case-specific evidence that you reviewed showed that

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=418
1839

Terry Rounds was trying to quit smoking?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, leading, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Did you find any evidence in your review of the case-specific material that Terry Rounds was trying to quit smoking between 1982 and 1990?

A.   He was trying to stop smoking on numerous occasions during that time frame, yes.

Q.   And what was R.J. Reynolds telling the American people about quitting smoking during that time frame?

A.   Well, that the whole public relations effort was to say, first of all, it's not addicting.  They didn't -- in 1994, the CEOs swore that it wasn't addicting, even though 30 years before that their scientist had concluded conclusively that it was addicting.  So it was an effort.  And then the whole low-tar/low-nicotine scene came on the scene here. These are safer.  The health reassurance message was there.

So there was all kinds of messages that were in the public domain that are in direct contrast to what was in the private domain of the industry

documents.

Q.   Are you aware of any evidence to show that R.J. Reynolds, from 1982 to 1990, financially supported any stop-smoking programs in any hospitals in the United States?

A.   Not to my knowledge, no.

Q.   Do you recall they played you this song "Smoke! Smoke! Smoke!" that Cigarette?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And do you recall seeing Sammy Davis Junior in that ad?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And was Sammy Davis Junior a smoker?

A.   He was.  He died of laryngeal cancer, cancer of the voice box.  That's what he died from.

Q.   Related to smoking?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, they talked about Premier and Eclipse. Do you remember that?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection.  Objection, Your

Honor.  Misstates.

THE COURT:  Overruled.  Go ahead. THE WITNESS:  They talked about Premier. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=420

A

I don't think they talked about Eclipse

Q.   Where is Premier today?

A.   It didn't sell.

Q.   Oh.  Why not?

A.   Because it wasn't a very efficient drug delivery device compared to the conventional cigarette.

Q.   You talked today about -- or the Reynolds lawyer asked you today whether there were more former smokers in the United States than current smokers.  Do you remember those series of questions?

A.   Former living smokers, yes.

Q.   Let's go back to when Terry Rounds was alive. Are you aware of any statistical evidence to show that while Terry was alive there were more former smokers than current smokers?

A.   Well, the numbers have kind of gone up over the years.  It depends on which year you talk about. So currently there are 43 or so million smokers in the country today, but there are now more ex-smokers living than there are current smokers.  I'm not sure what the time -- it would have been probably pretty close to being either still more current smokers or close to more current -- close to being the same number during the eighties and the early nineties, but I couldn't --I can't give you the specific numbers, no.

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963

Q.   Would you say that there are less smokers today than there were before the Minnesota trial? MR. HARRISON:  Objection, leading, Your

Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Are there -- are you aware of the statistics concerning the number of smokers today versus the number of smokers in the 1990s?

A.   Well, it's even back further than that.  We basically have the same number of smokers today that we did in 1964 when -- the time of the first Surgeon General's report.  So the reason the prevalence has gone down, we now say that it's only about 16 percent of the population smoke, but that's because the population has increased over time.  So the prevalence of smoking is really misleading.  There's still over 43 or 44 million smokers, which is basically the same number of smokers that we had back in 1964.

Q.   Okay.  I'm going to ask you, just show you one exhibit that we've already talked about, the consumption chart, and just ask you a couple of questions, then I'll be done.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Doctor, the red line in this consumption

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=422
1843

chart that we talked about Friday is what?

A.   It's male lung cancer rates based on 100,000 population.

Q.   And the yellow line on this chart is what?

A.   The total cigarette consumption.  So again, this is --

Q.   Wait.  Which way is the line going from 1990 forward versus from 1990 before?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, Your Honor, beyond

the scope.

THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  Rephrase the question. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Yes.  Does the -- is the lung cancer rate dropping after 1990 and 2000 as opposed to before that time?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, leading. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Which way is the lung cancer rate going, Doctor?  From 1990 forward, is it going up or is it going down?

A.   It's going down.

Q.   Would you please tell the jury why?

A.   Because the rate of smoking has gone down

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=423
1844

in -- in men.  It's not because of a change in the cigarette design, it's because the rate of smoking has gone down.

Q.   Can you tell this jury why the rate of smoking has gone down from the 1990s as opposed to before?  Why?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, beyond the scope. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Do you know why, Doctor, the rate of smoking is dropping --

MR. HARRISON:  Objection. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   -- and the lung cancer is dropping in this country?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, beyond the scope.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, have you studied the reasons why the lung cancer rate in men is declining on this chart?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, beyond the scope.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   Doctor, have you found in your professional experience that addicted smokers who know, who receive information from you, does that information that they

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=424
1845

receive about nicotine and about the dangers of smoking

help them to quit --

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, objection.

BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   --or hurt them from quitting?

MR. HARRISON:  Objection, leading. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Well, when we talk to smokers at various levels -- but the best example I could give you would be in our residential treatment program.  We have a lot of interface with the patients, and the thing that really gives them the most information is what happens in the brain, because that helps to relieve a lot of their guilt.  They say, Well, gosh, you know, if this is something that I had no control over, I didn't know about this, then it just isn't a problem with willpower or being a strong person.

So that kind of information is very valuable to people who are trying to stop smoking, as well as the health risks are important as well, especially if you can personalize it to that individual.  But I think probably the one thing that they relate to the most is the brain, brain change that have occurred and why this is

Riesdorph Reporting Group, Inc. (813) 222-8963
pgNbr=425
1846

important for them being unable to stop smoking. BY MR. WICHMANN:

Q.   And do we know more about those brain changes today than we did in the 1990s? A.   Yes.

MR. WICHMANN:  Thank you.  No further questions, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Anything at all?

MR. HARRISON:  No, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Before I let Dr. Hurt go.  I'm going to go ahead and send you off to lunch.  We got started a little bit late.
