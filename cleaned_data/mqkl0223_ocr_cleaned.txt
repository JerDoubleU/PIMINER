1   The following proceedings continued at 9:00 a.m.:

2             COURT DEPUTY:  All rise.  Court is now

3        back in session.  Please be seated.

4             THE COURT:  Counsel, as promised, I made

5        time to go through the motions for directed

6        verdict last night.

7             I have a question about one.  I don't want

8        to hold up the jury, but when we break � I

9        don't think I'm going to need to go into it

10        very deeply.  Maybe kind of an outline of the

11        arguments on each side as to the directed

12        verdict motion for � as to claims for punitive

13        damages based on nonintentional torts.

14             I'd just like to hear from you on that.

15             It may � I think it's going to be

16        primarily a matter of refreshing my memory on

17        the countervailing arguments that I heard, you

18        know, over a year ago.  There may be some new

19        law for me to hear, I don't know.

2 0                             Apart from that � apart from that, I

21        anticipate denying the motions.

22             And let's bring in the jury.

23             COURT DEPUTY:  Yes, sir.

24              (Jurors entered the courtroom.)

25             THE COURT:  Is this a Philip Morris

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=5
3795

1        witness or a Reynolds witness?

2             Is this your witness too?

3             MR. WILLIAMS:  Yes.

4             THE COURT:  So I'll call it a Defense

5        witness.

6              (Jurors entered the courtroom.)

7             COURT DEPUTY:  The jury's in the box and

8        seated, Your Honor.

9             THE COURT:  Thank you and good morning.

10             Whoa.  How is that?

11             The Plaintiff has rested.  It's now the

12        Defense's turn.  Mr. Ware, please call your

13        first witness.

14             MR. WARE:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May it

15        please the Court.  Good morning members of the

16        jury.

17             Dr. Lucian Chirieac.

18             COURT DEPUTY:  Stand right there and face

19        the court and raise your right hand to take the

20        oath.

21   Thereupon:

22                  LUCIAN CHIRIEAC, M.D.

23   having been sworn by the Clerk testified as follows:

24             THE WITNESS:  I swear.

25             COURT DEPUTY:  Come on this way, please.

2                    DIRECT EXAMINATION

3     BY MR. WARE

4        Q.   Good morning.

5        A.   Good morning.

6        Q.   Will you state your name to the Court and

7   members of jury?

8        A.   Dr. Lucian Chirieac.

9        Q.   And you are a medical doctor, are you not,

10   Dr. Chirieac?

11        A.   That's correct.

12        Q.   Tell us where you practice medicine.

13        A.   I practice pathology at Brigham and

14   Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

15        Q.   I'm going to ask you to pull the

16   microphone a little closer to you.

17             MR. WARE:  Your Honor, are we on the air

18        here?

19             THE COURT:  Yeah, we are.  We are live

20        and � I think � yeah, it's okay.

21             THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

22             THE COURT:  You can actually pull the base

23        a little closer too.  That will probably work. 2 4            BY MR. WARE

2 5                  Q.   Tell us again where you are affiliated.

3797

1        A.   I practice pathology at Brigham and

2   Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts.

3        Q.   And is Brigham and Women's Hospital

4   affiliated with a cancer institution as well?

5        A.   That's correct.

6        Q.   What is that institution?

7        A.   Brigham and Women's Hospital is affiliated

8   with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute.

9        Q.   Tell us what Dana-Farber Cancer Institute

10   is, just briefly.

11        A.   Dana-Farber Cancer Institute is the

12   outpatient hospital for patients that come to

13   Brigham Hospital to be treated for cancer.

14        Q.   Are there certain kinds of patients who

15   come to Brigham and Women's Hospital specifically

16   for cancer pathology?

17        A.   Yes.  We have a very large population of

18   patients that are coming � that are diagnosed with

19   cancer, and they come to Brigham and Women's

20   Hospital, and they can receive either a treatment

21   with chemotherapeutic drugs at Dana-Farber, or they

22   could be treated with surgery at Brigham and Women's

23   Hospital.

2 4        Q.   And is there something about the nature of

2 5       that patient population for a pathology � or your

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=8
3798

1   practice of pathology, are they unusual cases?  Are

2   they typical cases?  What are the characteristics,

3   if you will?

4        A.   Correct.  So the � the hospital, Brigham

5   Hospital, is considered one of the centers of

6   excellence for treating patients with cancer.  On

7   one hand.  On the other hand, it's called a tertiary

8   care facility.

9             In other words, it's a hospital that is

10   highly specialized to treat people with unusual

11   conditions with unusual cancers, unusual patients

12   with usual cancers, or the other way around.  But in

13   a way we have a high experience and a long

14   experience in treating patients with cancer.

15        Q.   Now, you mentioned that you're a

16   pathologist.  We've heard a bit about that.  We've

17   seen some pathology reports.  But remind us

18   basically what a pathologist is.

19        A.   So pathology is the science of disease.

20   So a pathologist is a specialized physician or a

21   specialized doctor that looks in the microscope and

22   would make the diagnosis of a certain condition, of

23   a certain disease.

24             So we are the ones that look into the

25   microscope and render a diagnosis.  We write the

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=9
3799

1   pathology report.  And based on this diagnosis

2   report, the patient will be further treated in

3   different ways.

4        Q.   Tell us where you went to medical school,

5   or where at least you started your training.

6        A.   Yes.  So I was admitted to go medical

7   school in Bacau, Romania.  I pursued the medical

8   school for six years.  Is a different system than

9   here.  The medical school in Romania is based on a

10   French system.  At 19 years of age.  And I �

11   obviously, I graduated when I was 25 in Bacau,

12   Romania.

13        Q.   Subsequent to your graduation from medical

14   school in Romania, did you in fact train initially

15   in France?

16        A.   I did train in France.  I had a short

17   period of training in France as an orthopedic

18   surgeon.

19        Q.   All right.  And so for a period of a 2 0       couple of years, you were in fact training in

21   orthopedic surgery?

22        A.   This is correct.

2 3        Q.   And that was at Edouard Hospital in Lyon?

24        A.   Edouard Herriot in Lyon.  And in

25   Saint-Etienne, yes.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=10
3800

1        Q.   And you were a fellow in Saint-Etienne?

2        A.   Yes.

3        Q.   Now, after that you trained in the United

4   States, did you not?

5        A.   Correct.

6        Q.   And tell us about that.  Give us a little

7   bit � a short history of the institutions at which

8   you trained subsequent to your orthopedic surgery

9   training.

10        A.   I came into this country with my family in

11   1994, and I decided to pursue a career in pathology.

12   I was at the time a resident in pathology at the

13   University of Rochester in upstate New York.  I

14   trained there until 2002.  And immediately after I

15   was admitted and I was accepted for training, a

16   fellowship, a specialty if you want, in cancer

17   pathology at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in

18   Houston.

19        Q.   In Houston.

2 0                             While you were at the University of

21       Rochester, among the honors you received, you were

2 2       named chief fellow; is that correct?

23        A.   Chief fellow I was at the MD Anderson

24   Cancer Center.

2 5        Q.   Okay.  Now, when were you at MD Anderson,

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=11
3801

1   did you also participate in research of a particular

2   kind?

3        A.   Yes.  I was doing � first I was doing a

4   clinical specialty in cancer, in pathology of

5   cancer, and then also after that I pursue a career

6   in � did I some translational-type research to

7   study cancer.

8        Q.   And specifically did you study colorectal

9   cancer and cancer involving lymph nodes?

10        A.   Correct.  I did a fellowship in

11   researching colorectal cancer.

12        Q.   I think you mentioned the term or used the

13   term "selective pathology."  Did you train in

14   selective pathology?

15        A.   Right.  Selective pathology means a

16   broader area of surgical pathology of cancer.

17        Q.   And where did you do that?

18        A.   MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

19        Q.   We've heard about board certification. 2 0       Give us the short version.  What is board

21       certification and tell us in what fields you are

2 2       board certified.

23        A.   Yes.  Before anyone, any physician can

24   practice pathology in the United States of America,

25   he or she needs to pass a board and to take the

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=12
3802

1   certification, which I did.  And I'm a diplomate of

2   the American Board of Pathology and Clinical

3   Medicine.  So I have � I'm licensed to practice

4   pathology in two fields, anatomic pathology and

5   clinical and laboratory medicine.

6        Q.   Now, can you explain to us � you don't go

7   to the hospital and do rounds and see patients every

8   day; is that correct?

9        A.   Correct.

10        Q.   How � how do you and to what extent do

11   you determine or work with others in determining the

12   treatment of patients as opposed to just laboratory

13   work?

14        A.   Yes.  So like my � if you want my typical

15   day or my usual day of going to the hospital every

16   morning, is I meet with my residents.  So my

17   residents are physicians that would like to pursue a

18   career in pathology like I have.  They prepare the

19   cases for me every morning.  And these cases mean

20   that they would look at the glass lights we call

21   them, so they are like fragments of tissue that are

22   put on the slides.  And these are from patients that

23   are inpatient in the hospital, or they are patients

24   that are coming with their biopsies from different

25   other hospitals in the country, or international

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=13
3803

1   patients.

2             And based on this information and based on

3   looking both of us at these slides, we arrive at the

4   conclusion � I'm the teacher, and the resident is

5   the student � we arrive to a conclusion of the

6   diagnosis, and then we issue a report, I issue a

7   report regarding the diagnosis of that particular

8   patient.

9             So this is my clinical part of my daily

10   activities.

11             In addition, what I do is I communicate

12   with the other members of the treating team, with

13   thoracic surgeons, with medical oncologists, with

14   radiologists, and we arrive to a conclusion of

15   the � what would be the best way to treat the

16   patient, what is the prognosis; in other words, how

17   long that patient would live or, you know, how

18   severe is the disease, how spread is the disease,

19   and so on.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=16
3806

1   pathologist in training.  So when I was in training

2   years back, the project that I was involved with and

3   the study as I did at that time was awarded with the

4   highest distinction of a pathologist in training by

5   the USCAP, or the United States and Canadian Academy

6   of Pathology.

7        Q.   In your career, you've also received

8   awards for presentation including from Dana-Farber

9   and the Harvard Cancer Center; is that correct?

10        A.   That's correct.

11        Q.   All right.  And so then let me ask you a

12   few questions about grants that you've received.

13   And grands in a nutshell are funding from outside

14   sources for purposes of research; is that correct?

15        A.   We call them extramural funding; in other

16   words, money received from different entities,

17   governmental or not, to pursue our research

18   projects, yes.

19        Q.   Among the entities that often fund medical 2 0       research are the National Institutes of Health,

21   correct?

22        A.   Correct.

2 3        Q.   And you have participated as director,

2 4       co-director, and investigator for a number of grants

2 5       from the National Institutes of Health and the

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=17
3807

1   National Cancer Institute, have you not?

2        A.   Correct.

3        Q.   You've also participated or been an

4   investigator on behalf of the Department of Defense

5   grant regarding biomarkers and approaches to

6   targeted therapy for lung cancer?

7        A.   Correct.

8        Q.   Currently you're involved in several

9   grants as well and doing research, are you not?

10        A.   Yes.

11        Q.   Okay.  You have endless publications.  I

12   think I'm not going to go through that.

13             And among other things, you've trained a

14   number of physicians who now have gone on and become

15   professors, associate professors, or teachers at

16   other medical schools and institutions around the

17   world, is that so?

18        A.   That's correct.  So we have a very strong

19   commitment with the younger generations and a strong

20   mentorship role at Brigham Hospital, and also at

21   Harvard Medical School where I teach the students as

22   well.

2 3        Q.   All right.  Now, tell the jury about some

2 4       specific research that you're currently doing that

2 5       relates to a genetic mutation that frequently occurs

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=18
3808

1   in young women.  What work are you doing?

2        A.   Yes.  So part of my research is being

3   involved in finding some particular abnormalities

4   that are unique to patients of lung cancer.

5   Starting a few years back we identified that not all

6   the lung cancers are similar; in other words, there

7   is a particular type of cancer, lung cancer, that

8   usually is involving women, especially young women,

9   especially nonsmokers.

10             These cancers, later on we found out they

11   are called ALK, lung adenocarcinoma, they have

12   particular abnormalities, and strikingly, these type

13   of cancers, which are about 5 to 10 percent of all

14   the lung cancers, they are occurring in young

15   nonsmoking women.

16             And the � I think the most rewarding

17   thing about this type of cancer is this could be

18   treated not in a conventional way with the

19   chemotherapy where it makes the hair to fall out and

20   have a lot of devastating effects on the patient,

21   but actually, this type of cancers nowadays are

22   treated with a drug which was approved in 2010, '11,

23   by FDA, and this drug, basically just take it like

24   an aspirin on the mouth, and the tumor completely

25   goes away.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=19
3809

1             And probably this is one of the most

2   striking and the most rewarding moments of my career

3   as a physician.  And since again a couple years

4   back, this drug, which is called Crizotinib, it's

5   one of the most important drugs in the field of lung

6   cancer.

7        Q.   And among other things, you developed the

8   antibody which permitted pathologists and others to

9   actually identify this genetic mutation so that the

10   drug could be targeted just to this mutant gene; is

11   that correct?

12        A.   That's correct.  Some of the � my

13   publications describe the new antibodies or new

14   testing or laboratory testing technique.  And this

15   antibody actually could identify this type of

16   cancers.

17             And nowadays, every day when I go to the

18   hospital, one of the first tests we do to each

19   patient of lung cancer � or that has been diagnosed

20   with lung cancer is to do this testing.  Why?

21   Because the treatment is so different, and the

22   treatment improves a lot, not only the survival of

23   these patients, but this particular treatment

24   improves the quality of life.  Patients are not

25   bedridden.  Patients could walk around.  It's true

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=20
3810

1   with lung cancer.  But we can prolong the life of

2   these patients and make the quality much better.

3        Q.   Now, just a couple other questions.  You

4   are also coauthor of some � well, many, many

5   articles that we won't go into, but you also have

6   contributed five or seven chapters to the World

7   Health Organization's manual or bible, if you will,

8   of criteria for the diagnosis of cancer; is that

9   correct?

10        A.   Yes, that's correct.

11        Q.   You mentioned that you do teaching, and I

12   know you told us that you teach medical students.

13   These are students from Harvard Medical School in

14   Boston, which is affiliated with Dana-Farber and

15   with Brigham and Women's ?

16        A.   Correct.

17        Q.   Do you also teach pathology, not just to

18   residents who come to the hospital or to your

19   laboratory, but do you also teach medical school,

2 0       classes, to first or second year medical students?

21        A.   Second year, correct.

2 2        Q.   You have been an expert witness, but

2 3       infrequently; is that correct?

24        A.   Correct.

2 5        Q.   And you've testified, I think, in maybe

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=21
3811

1   three depositions; is that right?

2        A.   Correct.

3        Q.   Have you ever testified at trial in the

4   past?

5        A.   Yes, I did.

6        Q.   And what kind of a case was that?

7        A.   It was a patient that had malignant

8   mesothelioma induced by radiation after a treatment

9   for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

10        Q.   Now you said mesothelioma.  That's an area

11   of cancer or thoracic cancer in which you also have

12   a lot of background; is that correct?

13        A.   Correct.  It's a different type of cancer

14   that can involve the chest cavity or thorax.

15        Q.   And so as opposed to lung cancer,

16   mesothelioma, briefly, is the lining of the lung as

17   opposed to the lung itself, the pleura?

18        A.   Correct.

19        Q.   Now, did I and others ask you to review 2 0       certain materials relating to Mr. Duignan for

21   purposes of making a diagnosis in this case?

22        A.   Correct.

2 3        Q.   And did you do that?  Did you review those

2 4       materials?

25                  A.   Yes.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=22
3812

1        Q.   And initially you reviewed some of the

2   materials, and subsequently you reviewed other

3   materials, including depositions of the family in

4   this case, is that correct?

5        A.   Correct.

6        Q.   And you reviewed, to your knowledge, all

7   of the medical records that you believe to have been

8   pertinent to your opinions?

9        A.   That's correct.

10        Q.   Tell us a little bit about your

11   compensation.  Do you charge on a daily basis for

12   your appearance, for example, here today?

13        A.   I charge $500 per hour of any kind of time

14   that's involved in me preparing or reading

15   materials.

16        Q.   And what about for an appearance in court,

17   do you charge on the same basis?

18        A.   Yes.  I charge on a daily basis.

19        Q. Now, let me put up � I want to turn to 2 0       your opinions. And let me put up a slide which I 21       believe you've helped prepare. Just tell us what 2 2       you are going to talk about here this morning as

2 3       regards to your opinions.

24        A.   So these are my opinions, or a summary of

25   my opinions, if you want, regarding the � my

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=23
3813

1   expertise after reviewing the case of Mr. Douglas

2   Duignan.

3        Q.   Okay.  And talk to the jury about what

4   those opinions are, just an overview, and we'll get

5   into the reasons.

6        A.   Right.  So, number one, my first opinion,

7   is that the final diagnosis and a definitive

8   diagnosis of primary lung cancer was not established

9   in this case.

10             Number two, the most likely diagnosis of

11   Mr. Duignan is cancers of unknown primary, where we

12   call a "CUP," C-U-P.

13             And my third conclusion is, without

14   knowing the primary site, as I mentioned in the

15   conclusions number one and number two, we cannot

16   determine whether the smoking was a cause of this

17   type of cancer.

18        Q.   The jury's heard a lot about cancer, we've

19   seen some graphics of what cancer cells look like in 2 0       the lung, including in the lung of a smoker.  But

21   just remind us, broadly, what cancer is.

22        A.   So cancer, in a broader term, is an

23   uncontrolled growth.  In other words, the major �

24   two major qualities, if you want to, or properties,

25   of a cancer in any � of any kind, of any type, in

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=24
3814

1   any human being is, number one, that it's destroying

2   aggressively all the tissues around, so it's growing

3   and it's growth destructively around the tissues;

4   and the second important property that the cancer,

5   anywhere shows up in the body, could spread sooner

6   or later to distant sites.  And we call this

7   "metastases."

8        Q.   What does � we've heard this term

9   "primary cancer" and I think the evidence here is

10   that a primary cancer is simply named for the site

11   in which it starts, is that accurate?

12        A.   It's accurate.

13        Q.   And you used word "metastasis."  And I

14   think you said earlier that that just means the

15   spread of the cancer?

16        A.   Spread and location of distant sites.

17        Q.   Are there examples you can show us, just

18   briefly, of different cell types of cancer that are

19   quite common?

2 0        A.   Right.

21        Q.   And for that purpose, let me put up

2 2       another slide.

23        A.   So the most common type of cancer are

24   cancers that are growing from epithelial tissue.

25   Epithelial tissue means any kind of tissue that

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=25
3815

1   covers the � all the coverings of the body.  So we

2   have epithelium covering the skin and the outside

3   body, we also have epithelial covering our mucosal

4   surfaces of the nose, mouth, trachea inside, lungs,

5   colon, colorectal cancer, so everything that comes

6   into contact with air is through the epithelia.

7             This, obviously, is because it's in more

8   contact with the environment and the environmental

9   factors, it's the most susceptible type of tissue to

10   developing cancer.  And this type of cancer is

11   called "carcinoma."

12             Probably about 90 percent of all the

13   cancers in the human bodies are carcinoma.

14             Now, some of the types of cancer, and if

15   you have a cancer that grows out of the melanocytes,

16   or the pigment-producing cells in the skin, we call

17   that "melanoma."  Again, a very aggressive type of

18   cancer.

19             "Sarcoma," on the other hand, is a cancer

20   that comes up from � could originate in the muscle,

21   in the bone, we call it osteosarcoma.  In the

22   muscle, we call it rhabdomyosarcoma.  In the fat, we

23   call it liposarcoma.  So not these common cancers

24   but they occur and they are called "sarcomas."

25             Also, the cells that are traveling in our

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=26
3816

1   body, in the blood, cells also there are the same

2   cells that are in the marrow of the bones, we call

3   it "bone marrow cells," these are blocked form of

4   cells.  These ones are very susceptible of � of

5   inducing different types of cancers, we call those

6   cancers "lymphomas," when there's a mass or

7   leukemia, when the cancer cells, lymphoma cells,

8   travel into the blood.

9             And, finally, another type, major type, is

10   called germ cell tumors, usually these are the

11   cancers that grow from the reproductive tissue in

12   the � in the cells from the ovaries or from the

13   testicles, in men.  These are usually cancer that

14   are � they are in � usually in the younger

15   patients.  We call them germ cell tumors.

16        Q.   We've heard the term "adenocarcinoma."

17   Can you tell us what that is?

18        A.   Yeah.  Adenocarcinomas are a particular

19   type of carcinoma.  Carcinomas, broadly, so the

20   first � the first category there is broadly �

21   broadly divided into three types of major cancers:

22   One is called adenocarcinoma, and usually

23   adenocarcinomas are cancers with carcinomas that

24   originate into the gland-forming epithelia.

25             In other words, the tumor � the cells in

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=27
3817

1   our body, they make mucus and they make glands,

2   those are the same cells that give rise to

3   adenocarcinomas.

4             Another important subtype of this type of

5   carcinoma are what's called "squamous carcinomas."

6   And the squamous � actually squamous carcinomas

7   could � are derived from cells that are making

8   keratin.  So all the squamous cancers in older

9   people that are from the skin, epithelia, squamous

10   carcinomas in the � in the uterine cavity of women.

11   Squamous carcinomas from the lung cancers.  So there

12   are different type of squamous carcinomas in the

13   esophagus, also you can have squamous carcinoma,

14   again, the second important category of carcinoma.

15             And, lastly, we have what's called a

16   "neuroendocrine carcinoma" so that we have different

17   specialized cells in our human body that are

18   producing hormones.  And those could also induce

19   what we call new "neuroendocrine carcinomas."

2 0        Q.   Where in the body can adenocarcinomas

21   originate?

22        A.   Anywhere, as I mentioned before, anywhere

23   in the human body.  An organ has glands.  Those

24   glands could go and transform themselves into an

25   adenocarcinoma.

1             So you can have thyroid adenocarcinomas,

2   you can have pancreatic adenocarcinomas, lung

3   adenocarcinomas, colorectal adenocarcinomas,

4   prostate carcinomas.  Many other � again, any organ

5   with mucin-producing cells with � salivary gland

6   adenocarcinomas would � would have this type.

7        Q.   And can adenocarcinomas that start at a

8   primary site, other than the lung, spread to the

9   lungs?

10        A.   Lung cancer is, if you want, the final

11   stop of many cancers.  So lung is notorious for

12   being the very important site of hosting metastases

13   as their masses.

14        Q.   And by that you mean the spread of cancer

15   from other sites?

16        A.   Correct.

17        Q.   Can adenocarcinomas start at a primary

18   site, other than the lung, and spread to, for

19   example, hilar lymph nodes?

20        A.   Hilar lymph nodes of the lung, yes.

21        Q.   And what kinds of cancers � maybe you've

2 2       answered this.  But what kinds of cancers can spread

2 3       to the lung, metastasize to the lung?

24        A.   It's, you know, the list is � is large.

25   You can have colorectal cancer go into the lung, you

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=29
3819

1   can have prostate cancer go to lung, you can have

2   breast cancer � this is a very common � it's a

3   very common occurrence.  We have patients that are

4   women that were diagnosed with breast cancer in the

5   40s.  The patients is treated.  Ten years later the

6   patient comes up with a single mass in the lung, and

7   the question is, is that a new primary lung cancer

8   or is that a metastases from breast.  It's a very

9   common story we hear everyday.

10             We have patients that have esophageal

11   cancer, treated for esophageal cancer, they can show

12   up with metastases in the lung many years later.

13             Patients with bladder cancer, treated for

14   bladder cancer, they can show up years later with �

15   with a nodule in the � in the lung.

16        Q.   The last two you mentioned were

17   esophageal, meaning from the esophagus?

18        A.   Correct.

19        Q.   And bladder cancer; is that right?

20        A.   Correct.

21        Q.   Now �

22        A.   Melanomas can go to the lung, very common.

23   Lymphomas can go to the lung.  It's � it's � it's

24   a very broad spectrum and I think my � my daily

25   routine in practice is not as much to diagnose lung

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=30
3820

1   cancer, which, of course, that's the main thing, but

2   the other thing is to exclude other types of cancers

3   which are not as devastating as lung cancer.

4             If you know about lung cancer, it is a

5   very aggressive and deadly cancer.  So if � if we

6   provide the patient with � with a different

7   diagnosis in the history, that's an extremely

8   different therapeutic avenue.

9        Q.   What is the importance of knowing the

10   primary site of the cancer from the patient's point

11   of view?

12        A.   Umm...

13        Q.   Well, from the physician's point of view,

14   as well?

15        A.   Exactly.  It's exactly what I mentioned

16   before.  Treatment, treatment � treatments are

17   different.

18             Prognosis.  It's a different prognosis

19   when a patient has a Stage IV colorectal cancer

20   spread to the lung, or thyroid cancer, as opposed to

21   primary lung cancer.

22             Surgery.  If it's primary lung cancer, you

23   can operate on.  If it's a metastases, you can't.

24             So there are many important

25   characteristics in distinguishing primary versus

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=31
3821

1   metastatic.

2        Q.   Do you participate in what are known as

3   "tumor boards"?

4        A.   Yes.  It's part of our daily routine

5   treatment decision-making plans.

6        Q.   And tell us about that.  How does the

7   tumor board function?  Who participates, and how is

8   it that you become involved in the choice of or

9   recommendations of treatment for patients on a

10   regular basis?

11        A.   So every week we have two types of tumor

12   boards.  One it's a tumor board for � which is a

13   conference held every Wednesday morning from

14   7:30 regarding discussion of patients with lung

15   cancer that need to have surgery or they had

16   surgery.  And this is � this is a conference or a

17   board that is held in collaboration with thoracic

18   surgeons, with pathologists, with radiologists, and

19   with oncologists.

20             And, then, another tumor board, at noon on

21   Thursdays, is regarding the patients that have an

22   advanced disease, we cannot operate on because if

23   the lung cancer spread to different organs, the

24   surgical option is � is not viable anymore in these

25   patients � excuse me � usually are treating with

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=32
3822

1   chemotherapy drugs or with alk-blocking drugs, or we

2   call them "targeted therapies" at Dana-Farber.

3   So � as I mentioned before, so these are the two

4   main tumor boards I am � I am involved with.

5        Q.   And when you say "you're involved with

6   them," do you make recommendations or advise both

7   surgeons and oncologists and the rest of the team on

8   your findings so that they can select an appropriate

9   treatment going forward?

10        A.   Correct.  I am part of the treatment

11   clinical team, and in choosing the � the treatment

12   options, the survival options, and all the options

13   for a particular patient.

14        Q.   Do all cancers have a primary site?

15        A.   No.

16        Q.   And when you say that, what do you mean?

17        A.   I mean that not all the � despite all our

18   advancing knowledge in � in the field of medicine

19   of pathology, not all the cancers that we diagnose

20   in the human body have a primary origin.  This is a

21   type of cancer which gets more and more recognition,

22   lately, in the past ten years, and these are called,

23   as I mentioned before, that's called "cancer of

24   unknown primary origin," so � or CUP.

25             This is a field that is � is getting a

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=33
3823

1   lot of recognition lately.  It's one of the diseases

2   and type of cancers that is very frustrating for us

3   as � as pathologists, and for clinicians, because

4   we cannot offer an answer to a particular patient

5   if, you know, you have a mass somewhere else in the

6   body and we cannot tell a particular patient, Hey,

7   listen, that particular cancer arise somewhere.  So

8   this is a well-defined entity called "cancers of

9   unknown primary."

10        Q.   And how common is a diagnosis of cancer of

11   unknown primary in your experience?

12        A.   It's not as common as the other types of

13   cancers.  We see it out there, but it's not as

14   common as other cancers.

15        Q.   How often do you and your team see cancers

16   of unknown primary?

17        A.   I cannot put a number onto it.  I note

18   numbers are there in the literature, but we also

19   have a specific � how to call it.  We have a

20   specific service in my department that deals with

21   this type of cancers of unknown origin.

2 2        Q.   Well, what I meant was how frequently, you

2 3       don't have to give us numbers, but how frequently

2 4       are cancers of unknown primary coming through the

2 5       hospital and being diagnosed by that team and

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=34
3824

1   special service?

2        A.   So this is a complete separate diagnostic

3   team.  But I would say two, three every day, you

4   know, more or less.  There are patients that are

5   coming with cancers somewhere in the lymph nodes or

6   in the liver or in any other location, and after

7   performing multiple expensive tests, we still cannot

8   tell where that origin of that cancer is.

9        Q.   Now, are there theories � are there

10   scientific theories about why you cannot identify a

11   primary site?  Does something happen to the cancer

12   cells, do they disappear?  What's going on insofar

13   as the scientific community knows at this point?

14        A.   Right.  So the pure explanation, it's not

15   entirely known, but there are many hypotheses, and

16   the most common hypothesis is that there are cells

17   in our body, in our human body, that are completely

18   primitive.  It's like a cell that doesn't look like

19   any other cells, it's so primitive.

20             Maybe any of you have heard of like stem

21   cells that are cells that are so primitive and so

22   undifferentiated that those are the cells that could

23   give rise, that could go in any direction, could go

24   in the direction of a mucin-producing cell, in the

25   direction of a squamous-producing or skin-producing

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=35
3825

1   cell.

2             But some of them are deeply located in

3   our � deeply in the organs, and if those cell, they

4   get some sort of a wrong signal or the DNA

5   replicative machinery goes wrong, those cells could

6   then evolve into and give rise to a cancer, we call

7   it an undifferentiated cancer, but the cells are so

8   primitive that we cannot tell, you know, what kind

9   of hat that tumor wears.  It's like an

10   adenocarcinoma, or is there the lung origin, or is

11   it a colorectal origin.

12             So that's the most common hypothesis we

13   have at the present time about this carcinoma of

14   unknown or uncertain primary origin.

15        Q.   What's the most common cell type among

16   cancers diagnosed as being of unknown primary?

17        A.   Adenocarcinomas would be so the cancers

18   that are derived from this mucin-producing cells are

19   the most common.

2 0        Q.   Let me ask you to tell us a little bit

21       about that group of individuals called in medicine a

2 2       cohort of white males in the age range of 42 years

2 3       old.  Can you tell us what's the most common types

2 4       of cancers in that age group.  White males, 40 to

25       44, say?

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=36
3826

1        A.   Yeah.  Well, you know, it's � when you

2   talk about this variant of people, it's uncommon to

3   have cancers.  So young people don't have cancer

4   unless they are children with leukemias, and

5   sometimes we have leukemia lymphomas.

6             As you know, the more advanced you go in

7   age is the higher the chances of someone to have

8   cancer.  And actually, this is one of the hypotheses

9   that is why we have so much cancer nowadays as

10   opposed to 100 years ago.  100 years ago people used

11   to die in their 40s and 50s from other diseases, so

12   nobody would live enough to get cancer.

13             But to go back to your � to your

14   question, the most common about this uncommon

15   category is actually they are like the � other

16   types of cancers like colorectal cancer is more

17   common in this age group of white men between 4 0 and

18   45, prostate cancer is another common one, germ cell

19   carcinoma is another common one, and I think it's

20   probably the fifth cause is lung cancer as a cancer

21   that is common in this age group.

22             But again, the � having the � having a

23   young person with cancer, it's very uncommon, it's

24   something that even ourselves, we do see them from

25   time to time, but it's not something that is common

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=37
3827

1   in this age group.

2        Q.   Let's turn, if we may, to the medical

3   records, and specifically to Mr. Duignan.  And I

4   want to put back your summary of opinions, if I may,

5   and talk about the first one.

6             You noted for us that it is your opinion

7   that primary lung cancer was not established as

8   regards to Mr. Duignan; is that correct?

9        A.   That's correct.

10        Q.   And you went through the medical records,

11   and are you � can you take us through this to some

12   extent, we aren't going to talk about them all, and

13   tell us how you arrived at that conclusion?

14        A.   Right.  So the most important pieces of

15   information for this statement is that the pathology

16   reports that are issued in Mr. Duignan's case were

17   diagnosed �

18        Q.   May I interrupt you, Doctor.  Before you

19   do that, let's just go chronologically a little bit 2 0       through some of the records.  But go ahead and

21       finish your thought here.  You said the most

2 2       important records were the pathology reports?

23        A.   Reports that are diagnosing the cancer of

24   undifferentiated quality.

2 5        Q.   Now, let me direct you, if I may, to

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=38
3828

1   PMUP041842.  And I've placed before you a notebook

2   of the medical records, and that would be tab 1 in

3   the book you have before you.  Do you have that in

4   front of you?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   And could we put that on the screen,

7   please.

8             How did Mr. Duignan present?  We've heard

9   a fair amount about this.  We know he had pain.  We

10   know it was related to what he believed in May of

11   1992 was an injury at work.  But what were the

12   presentation symptoms according to the medical

13   records?

14        A.   He was � he presented with a severe lower

15   back pain, it's called lumbosacral pain, was

16   radiating to the left leg.

17        Q.   All right.  And lumbosacral means what?

18        A.   Lower back pain.  Lumbosacral is exactly

19   here on the buttock area where the lumbar spine

20   connects with the sacrum.

21        Q.   And he also, according to the bottom

2 2       paragraph, said he had some complaint of spasms in

2 3       his left arm, correct?

24        A.   Right.  He had spasms in the left arm,

25   also he had a left leg weakness.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=39
3829

1        Q.   And about how long had he been having

2   symptoms as far as we know from the medical record?

3        A.   Since about May.  So if this is September,

4   it might be four months about the time period.

5        Q.   To your knowledge, was Mr. Duignan

6   complaining at that time of any respiratory

7   symptoms?

8        A.   No, he did not.

9        Q.   Was he coughing up blood?

10        A.   No, he did not.

11        Q.   If Mr. Duignan at that time had had

12   primary lung cancer or lung cancer, would you have

13   expected some additional symptoms?

14        A.   No.

15        Q.   Now, what was � let me direct you then to

16   PMUP041842 again, and specifically still in tab 1,

17   Dr. Parikh gives us some initial impressions, is

18   that correct?

19        A.   Correct.

2 0        Q.   And tell us what those were and what the

21   significance is to your opinion.

22        A.   So Dr. Parikh performed this neurological

23   examination, and what he recommended, obviously, he

24   didn't know the cause of it, so etiology is the

25   cause.  He obviously is trying to investigate

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=40
3830

1   further.

2             And in order to establish the cause of his

3   symptoms, he is trying to do multiple tests to rule

4   out, so to exclude, number one, a brain tumor, some

5   of the brain tumors, they could do that.  Also to

6   rule out the cervical cord lesion, so the spine.

7   The spine in the lower back, so the lumbar cauda

8   lesion.  And also to rule out the seizures.

9             So he orders some tests.  A CT of the

10   brain, some imaging of the brain.  Also the imaging

11   of the cervical thoracic lumbar spine in the back.

12   And also because the patient was a smoker, he

13   recommended a chest x-ray imaging the lungs.  And

14   also an orthopedic consultation, so to consult

15   regarding the bones and joints.

16        Q.   Let me next direct to you PMUP041797,

17   which is a radiology report, appears at tab 2 of

18   your notebook.  You would want it in front of you,

19   actually.

2 0                             And what was the result of that chest

21   x-ray according to the radiologist?

22        A.   So the chest x-ray was positive for a

23   mass.  So what it says here, it was a large mass

24   which was involving the right upper lobe.  So it's

25   in this area (indicating).  6 centimeters in

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=41
3831

1   diameter.  So 6-centimeters something like that that

2   was involved in the right upper lobe.

3        Q.   6 centimeters, we've heard a lot about the

4   tennis ball analogy here, and it appears in one of

5   the records.

6             6 centimeters is a little over 2 inches;

7   is that correct?

8        A.   Correct.

9        Q.   And at the bottom of this record, the word

10   "impression" appears.  To a physician, what does the

11   word "impression" mean in a medical record and is it

12   the same as the diagnosis?

13        A.   No.  So impression would � means

14   usually � the word "impression" is usually used by

15   clinicians other than pathologists.  It includes or

16   involves an area of uncertainty.  In other words,

17   just looking at the films, like this physician says,

18   it's his impression or her impression that this is a

19   certain condition.

2 0        Q.   When a physician uses the term

21       "impression," is he saying definitively that this is

2 2       what the problem is?

23        A.   He is not saying definitively what the

1   tab 3.  And these are consultation notes of

2   Dr. Shah, which I believe we've seen in part before.

3             And he does � well, you tell us, what do

4   you see in this record that was of significance to

5   you in forming your opinions?

6        A.   So the patient denies hemoptysis, which is

7   blood in the sputum.  He denies shortness of breath.

8   So any symptoms with the breathing.  He denies the

9   pain in the chest area.

10             Pleuritic-type pain is like when you

11   inhale and exhale, usually the back, the upper back

12   or the chest kind of has some pain.  The patient did

13   not have � Mr. Duignan didn't have any cough or

14   wheezing.

15             So again, this is reinforcing what the �

16   the imaging has shown, a large tennis-ball-size

17   lesion in the right upper lobe, or the 6-centimeter

18   mass.

19        Q.   Now, what additional steps did Dr. Shah 2 0       order as a result of the x-ray?

21                  A.   He �

2 2        Q.   If you remember.

2 3                             If you can just go to � that's good.

24        A.   Because this area has to be � not the

25   area, but what happened then, it happens now too, so

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408

3833

1   this is the first step in working up a patient with

2   a suspicious mass in the lung.

3             The next step is to identify from a

4   pathology point of view what is the nature of that

5   mass.  And the most common technique to do that is

6   performing a bronchoscopy, which means that you go

7   in and look in through the bronchus and take a

8   biopsy.  So take a sample, take a piece of tissue

9   from that mass, send it to laboratory, to us, look

10   at it under the microscope, and arrive to a final

11   conclusion.

12        Q.   And did that occur in this case?

13        A.   Correct.

14        Q.   And let me show you an x-ray and a

15   photograph for purposes of your testimony, and ask

16   you to describe what we see there.

17             Let me put up the x-ray.

18        A.   This is an example of how a transbronchial

19   lung biopsy looks.  So the word "transbronchial

20   biopsy" means � "biopsy" means to take a piece of

21   tissue to look under the microscope.

22             "Transbronchial" means like going through

23   the windpipe, through the nose, putting this tube

24   which you see on the right-hand side of your screen.

25   It's a flexible scope, so in other words, it's like

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=44
3834

1   a � it's like a � sort of like a rubber piece

2   which is very flexible.  It's introduced � it's

3   kind of thin.  You introduce it through the nose

4   down into the trachea or the windpipe.

5             And this at the end has like a little

6   camera.  So can you see as the surgeon advances this

7   camera, also looks into the monitor and sees

8   exactly � you see like a hole, like a pipe when it

9   advances.  And once you get to the area of interest,

10   the surgeon stops there, and then with a second

11   piece which is popping from that tube, which is a

12   needle, you go across the wall, that's why they call

13   it transbronchial.

14             So you go across the wall of this

15   bronchus, you perforate the wall, it's called

16   transbronchial, and you get pieces of that tissue of

17   that mass.  Then you retract the entire tube, and

18   then with that piece of that needle, you put it on a

19   piece of � a glass slide, and that's how we look at

20   this tissue.

21             In the world of lung cancers, so in the

22   clinical world, this technique represents about

23   90 percent of the techniques used to diagnose lung

24   cancer or metastases or a mass involving the lung

25   tissue.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=45
3835

1             The other 10 percent are you get to the

2   biopsy from the chest wall outside, we call it

3   percutaneous biopsy or transthoracic biopsy.  Those

4   are not very common because they have a lot of

5   problems.  But which is about 10 percent.  They are

6   common for nodules that are not located close to the

7   bronchus.  They are common for nodules that are

8   outside the periphery of the lung.

9        Q.   And how does the pulmonologist or

10   interventional radiologist or whoever is doing this

11   procedure assure that he can � he or she can take a

12   right turn with this bronchoscope and needle?

13        A.   They know the information from the

14   imaging.  So in the left-hand side, you see where

15   the mass is.  Now �

16        Q.   Can you describe � tell us what you're

17   saying a mass is in this particular x-ray.

18             This is not an x-ray of Mr. Duignan,

19   correct?

20        A.   No, it's not.

21        Q.   All right.

22        A.   This is just an illustration of how it

23   looks.  But the location of the mass is known before

24   performing the transbronchial biopsy.  So if you

25   know the location, in a way as human beings we have

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=46
3836

1   five lobes, three on the right-hand side and two on

2   the left-hand side, all of us.  Right upper lobe,

3   right middle lobe, right lower lobe.  Left upper

4   lobe, left lower lobe.

5             Once the surgeon or the intervention

6   radiologist knows for sure what the location of that

7   tumor is, then they can go with this technique and,

8   you know, go, because they know the anatomy and the

9   histology of the pulmonary system, and they can

10   stop, and usually where they stop is usually where

11   they see an abnormality.  Bleeding in the area.

12   Ulceration in the area.  Constriction in the area.

13             Since you ask me now, there's probably,

14   late in the last year, we have a very new technique,

15   it's not used commonly, but it's experimental, it's

16   pretty much like a GPS.  So basically the surgeon

17   just let this go, and then basically this tubing

18   actually travels very sophisticatedly to the area of

19   the lesion in like a GPS-guided manner.  And this is

20   probably going to be the future, but now it is just

21   experimental.  We do it and some other people.

22             But, you know, 99 percent of the patients

23   we diagnose with this technique, and again,

24   90 percent have transbronchial biopsies for lung

25   nodules.  The other 10 is from the skin.

pgNbr=47
3837

1        Q.   Now, the GPS technique, I take it, was not

2   available in 1992.

3        A.   It's probably the last year.

4        Q.   Is this, as you've described it, is this

5   technique what was available in 1992, to your

6   knowledge?

7        A.   Yes.  Transbronchial biopsies is done for

8   long periods of time.

9        Q.   And in that era, in the early '90s, you

10   were in training, did you have occasion to observe

11   and/or participate in transbronchial biopsy?

12        A.   In pathology training, that was '96 to

13   2002.  I did not directly participate in performing

14   any biopsies; however, as a pathologist when I was

15   in training at University of Rochester, I had the

16   chance to go in the operating room and to see what

17   the surgeons were doing advancing this tube, the

18   bronchoscope, and getting the tissue they wanted to.

19        Q.   Let me direct you to tab 4 in your 2 0       notebook and PMUP041842.

21                            Did Dr. Shah indicate in some way the

2 2       location of the possible lung mass with which he was

2 3       concerned?

24        A.   Yeah.  I mean, this is � this is a

25   diagram that, if you want, it's a sketch of saying

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=48
3838

1   exactly what I mentioned before.  It's a location of

2   the tumor.  It's in the right upper lobe.  So if you

3   see the circle there, it's a mass located in the

4   right upper lobe.  It's probably a drawing of the

5   imaging.  That's how I interpreted it.

6        Q.   All right.  And does the drawing itself

7   and its irregular shape or at least � yeah, its

8   irregular shape, have any particular significance to

9   you in reading this record?

10        A.   The only significance is location, right

11   upper lobe.  And I would take that the size would

12   be, if you want, 6 centimeters, I would guess.

13        Q.   What is your understanding of Dr. Shah's

14   conclusions as of this time?

15        A.   His � so at this point, obviously, he's

16   trying to get a biopsy and then his � that's his

17   impression, that, you know, this mass will be

18   investigating for being a primary lung mass, that

19   this cancer has advanced also to the spinal cord and

20   the brain.  Also he wants to investigate that the

21   left inguinal node.

22             So it's exactly what it says here,

23   "impression," you know, the highlighted area, it's a

24   lung mass carcinoma with mets to the spinal cord or

25   brain.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=49
3839

1        Q.   All right.  And down below we see his

2   actual notes; is that correct?

3        A.   Right.  And so, you know, as I mentioned,

4   it's � it's � we are � this is a snapshot in this

5   couple-of-month investigation, a couple of weeks

6   investigation of Mr. Duignan.  From where he

7   presented, now we are at the time where we know for

8   sure there's a mass in the right upper lobe, so the

9   next step is to have a tissue biopsy to establish

10   the final diagnosis.

11        Q.   What significance do you attach to the

12   fact that in this handwritten note, as translated

13   above � or rewritten above � he says � is that

14   "primary lung mass" with two question marks?

15        A.   It's � first, it says lymphoma.  You

16   asked me before what's the common thing in young

17   patients, 40 to 45.  Lymphoma, it's a completely

18   different diagnosis.  Lymphoma is treatable.  So

19   every clinician needs a pathologist to tell what

20   lymphoma is.  If you have a lymphoma, you do it

21   different type of medication, that patient is not

22   going to die.  If a patient has carcinoma, it's a

23   direct, devastating fatal disease.  So, you know,

24   it's very rightful so that the � that the physician

25   in this case advances some theories that need to be

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=50
3840

1   included or ruled in or excluded or ruled out in

2   order to proceed with the treatment.

3        Q.   Okay.  And then at the bottom it says

4   "plan," is that right, in the writing there?

5        A.   Right.  Bronchoscopy with biopsy.

6        Q.   Okay.  And it says "bronchoscopy biopsy

7   tomorrow," is that correct?

8        A.   Correct.

9        Q.   At this time, as you read the record,

10   based on your knowledge as a physician and

11   pathologist, has the doctor concluded what this

12   problem is, what this lung mass is?

13        A.   No, he did not.

14        Q.   Let me direct you to tab 6, if you would,

15   which is PMUP041842.  These are notes of Dr. Iyer.

16             Actually, let's � let's skip that.

17             Let's look at the pathology results, which

18   are at tab 7, PMUP041797.

19             Am I correct that this is the report of 2 0       the transbronchial biopsy?

21        A.   Correct.

2 2        Q.   And in the lower right corner, am I right,

2 3       that it's signed by a pathologist, such as yourself?

24        A.   Dr. Paul Hughes, correct.

2 5        Q.   And what is the significance of the

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=51
3841

1   results we see here, including the language, quote,

2   "no tumor seen"?

3        A.   Yes.  So this biopsy says a few messages,

4   if you want.  Number one, the biopsy says there are

5   fragments of bronchial wall and adjacent or

6   neighboring alveolar lung.

7             In other words, if I see on a biopsy a

8   piece of lung, that means that that needle went

9   through the � through the tube because if I just

10   scrape the surface of the bronchus, or that tube, I

11   see only the bronchial cells.  But what the

12   pathologist says here is, he says the -- this

13   Dr. Hughes, he says "I see bronchial wall," which is

14   naturally because I see where the needle went

15   through.  Second, he says, "I see alveolar lung

16   tissue."  In other words, the needle went through

17   and sent with some pieces of tissue.

18             And then, thirdly, it shows focal

19   fibrinous exudate, which means � "exudate" means

20   inflammation, so, you know, like pus, if you want.

21   That's the sign � the, you know, technical term.

22   It's like "focal fibrinous exudate."

23             Then fourth, which is another important

24   piece of information, it says, "no tumor seen."  So,

25   obviously, the question mark, is it tumor or not?

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=52
3842

1             So he says, well, I see bronchial wall.

2   Two, I see alveolar lung, three, I see inflammation

3   or pneumonitis, four, I don't see tumor.

4        Q.   And �

5        A.   And the comment, also, because, you know,

6   he wants to put everything together, his conclusion

7   is "this may represent an inflammatory or pneumonic

8   process," which means, this could be pneumonitis or

9   pneumonia, we call it.

10        Q.   Now, does this necessarily mean that there

11   was � there could have been no tumor in the lung?

12        A.   This could mean that either the entire

13   mass is inflammation or pneumonia, or this means

14   this could have been a tumor, right so, and

15   sometimes tumors, they comprise or they press on

16   the � on the bronchus and because of this

17   compression, then some of these patient develop

18   what's called "obstructive pneumonitis."

19             So it's a combination of tumor and

20   pneumonia in the same thing.  So what this says that

21   the surgeon � or the, sorry, the pneumatologist

22   that performed this biopsy hit only the inflammatory

23   process.  In other words, this could be pneumonia

24   only or pneumonia associated � induced by tumor.

25   This is what it means.

4     BY MR. WARE

5        Q.   Doctor, let me take you back to the

6   "report of pathologist," which I believe is at

7   tab 7.  I want to be clear on what the language "no

8   tumor seen" means.

9             Does that mean no cancer or, if it

10   doesn't, explain exactly what it means.

11        A.   Broadly means no cancer was seen on the

12   slide and of the biopsy.

13        Q.   Now, when a pathologist issues a pathology

14   report, is there an implicit obligation to state the

15   primary site if it can be determined?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   So tell us � tell us about that

18   obligation.  What is � what is the role of the

19   pathologist in the event that the pathologist can 2 0       determine primary site?

21        A.   So, broadly, we have different roles for

22   different specimen.  If it's a resection, it's a

23   different role, but for a biopsy we need to tell

24   exactly to convey to the treating physician and to

25   all the physicians in the treating team what type of

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=55
3845

1   biopsy's there.

2             If there is a mass, if there is normal,

3   was that just normal tissue because the surgeon

4   basically did not hit the mass.  Sometimes we see

5   only normal lung, and that's why we say, it's

6   normal, there's no evidence of mass, which implies

7   that probably the surgeon did not hit the mass.

8             However here, the implication is, yes, we

9   did see something.  We see that the patient �

10   the � the needle was actually the lung, and also we

11   see that we see another abnormality.  I mean, normal

12   people or normal humans do not have fibrinous

13   exudate as you see there.  So, yes, we did see an

14   abnormality.

15             And also, the pathologist knew at the time

16   there is a big question mark, is there a tumor or

17   not.  So he is answering all the, you know, if you

18   presented before that, you said the question mark

19   mass, question mark lymphoma, all those questions.

20   So the pathologist's answer is "no tumor seen."  So

21   that's the implication of all this wording in

22   this � in this pathology � in the � in the

23   pathology report.

2 4        Q.   And what exactly does "no tumor seen"

2 5       mean?

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=56
3846

1        A.   It means that no tumor was seen.

2        Q.   What's a "tumor"?

3        A.   A cancer.  That's � yes.  The � you

4   know, the translation in this instance is no cancer

5   was identified on that biopsy.

6        Q.   Let me ask you to go to tab 5.  There was

7   a description by Dr. Shah of the procedure, is there

8   not?

9        A.   Yes.

10        Q.   And so does this tell us whether Dr. Shah

11   was actually sampling in the right area, and tell us

12   why?

13        A.   Yes.  So this � every physician that is

14   doing any kind of procedure, by law they need to

15   report that, so they need to document.  Everything

16   is documented in the patient chart.  And this is

17   the � Dr. Shah's documentation of that procedure.

18             You see at the top � the top of the page

19   it says � it describes the procedure, "bronchoscopy

20   with bronchial biopsy and brushing."  And then the

21   report � right.

22             So, actually, this is a description, a

23   very detailed description, and exactly to document

24   what he did during that procedure.

25             So he is saying that the bronchoscope was

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=57
3847

1   advanced into the right nare, so into the right

2   nose, both the vocal cords, so go through � you

3   know, the patient is hyperextended, he had the neck

4   like this (indicating) � so it's like � and the

5   cords.  And then enter in the trachea, so the wind

6   pipe here.  Okay.  And then the bronchoscope was

7   advanced into the right upper lobe.  So right upper

8   lobe is here.  So when he gets to the bifurcation of

9   the trachea and the both, right and left bronchus,

10   he takes a right, and then, at some point, he

11   arrives at the trifurcation, is right upper

12   bronchus, bronchus intermedius is called, or the

13   middle bronchus, and the lower pipe is called the

14   right lower bronchus.

15             So he take an upgoing to the � to the

16   direction of where the mass is located.  So that's

17   why he say "the bronchoscope was advanced into the

18   right upper lobe and junction of the right upper

19   lobe and bronchus intermedius.  Intermedius is

20   middle.  So it's right upper in the middle.

21             So he gets here, in this area, and then

22   all of a sudden he says, "there is significantly

23   wider � so the bronchus intermedius is distended �

24   and there is a compression from the outside in that

25   area.  So he notes there is this mass, which was

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=58
3848

1   described in the imaging report, that is pushing on

2   this tube.  It's like � it's pushing from outside

3   into inside.

4             And then he stops there and he takes, with

5   a camera on the screen, then he advances the needle

6   and the needle � basically it's puncturing and it's

7   sampling, we say, that area where the mass is.

8        Q.   And where he says "there's no occlusion of

9   the right upper lobe," that means it's not blocked

10   off?

11        A.   Right.  There's no occlusion.  There's

12   no � there's no complete blockage at the right

13   upper lobe bronchus.

14        Q.   And what further observation does he then

15   make about where the biopsies were done?

16        A.   That he did exactly this biopsy from that

17   area where was the constriction.

18        Q.   Okay.  Let's �

19        A.   And then I can explain "brush and lavage,"

20   but I think these are just technical terms.  It's

21   sampling, basically.

2 2        Q.   Let's go ahead and explain them while we

2 3       have this up, then we don't need to go back to it

2 4       because there are, excuse me, additional pathology

2 5       reports from the brush and the wash, right?

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=59
3849

1        A.   Right.

2        Q.   Okay.  So, the sampling, where it talks

3   about advanced into the right upper lobe, it's

4   talking about advancing into the right upper lobe of

5   the lung, correct?

6        A.   Correct.

7        Q.   And � but the bronchial brush and

8   bronchial lavage � lavage just means washing,

9   correct?

10        A.   Washing.

11        Q.   And explain how those are done and then

12   we'll take a look at the pathology reports in a

13   couple of minutes.

14        A.   So brushing and lavage or washing, they

15   are two additional techniques that are done when

16   this procedure is performed.

17             So the � Dr. Shah, in this case, is doing

18   three separate tests.  So number one, he takes

19   tissue, which is called "biopsy," and number two and

20   three, he takes cells.  And cells � studying the

21   cells is a different area of pathology called

22   cytopathology.  And this is done by these two

23   techniques, brushing and washing.

24             In other words, he goes with the brush,

25   it's like a toothbrush, and he scrapes the surface

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=60
3850

1   of the � of that bronchus.  And then that

2   brushing � then he takes it out and he puts it on a

3   piece of glass slide, and then a cytopathologist is

4   looking at those cells.

5             And it's much easier to do than, you know,

6   than to puncture the bronchus.  And the lavage is a

7   second time or, you know, a second technique where

8   you get in some fluid, it's exactly how you wash the

9   floors, but then you collect not only the fluid

10   back, which you washed with, but the cells in that

11   environment.

12             And then you concentrate that fluid, that

13   solution of fluid, that cells, and, again, you put

14   it on a piece of � of slide.  So, in conclusion,

15   every patient would have two � two types of

16   reports.  He is going to have a biopsy report, which

17   we discussed earlier, but also will have a

18   cytopathology report, which is the result of the

19   brushing and the result of the washing or lavage.

20             Is a typo there, it's L-A-V-A-G-E.

21        Q.   Let's take a look at what the pathologist 2 2       said about the brushing and the washing.  In that

2 3       respect, let me direct your attention to tab 8 in

2 4       your notebook, which is �

25        A.   So this is a report �

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=61
3851

1        Q.   Hang on one second, I need to identify it

2   for the record.  The brush and the wash.

3             So with respect to the bronchial brush,

4   let me direct you to Exhibit PMUP041797 in your

5   notebook, tab 8, and please tell us the conclusions

6   of the pathologist.

7        A.   So this is the report, actually, the

8   pathology report, the cytopathology report, you see

9   in the upfront, you don't see it on the screen, but

10   actually it's important, it says "Cytologic Pap

11   Smear Results"; in other words, they put the cells

12   on the slide and they smear that solution on the

13   slides.  That's why it's called "Pap smear."

14             The audience is very familiar with the Pap

15   smear for every woman that is doing the Pap smear

16   results.  It's pretty much the same technique.  With

17   the brush it's exactly instead of being in the �

18   you know, in the woman's genital area, basically

19   it's in the � in the � on the main bronchus.

20             The same techniques, the same brushing,

21   the same fluid, the same slide, the same

22   cytopathologist and they are looking for the same

23   thing.  They are looking for what we call the cancer

24   cells or, in this, cohesive cancer cells.  So cancer

25   cells, they like to be � when a cancer there, they

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=62
3852

1   like to be very discohesive.

2             In other words, they are easily removed

3   from the wall.  So this report, actually conclusion

4   says that it's negative.  So the report did not �

5   or the technique did not identify any cancer.

6        Q.   Let me direct you, then, to the bronchial

7   wash at tab 9 in your notebook, PMUP041, again 797.

8             What's the pathology report say about the

9   lavage as opposed to the brushing?

10        A.   So it's � it's saying that there are

11   numerous benign � means that there is no cancer

12   cells � benign bronchial epithelial cells.  Is

13   exactly what we discussed before that, you know, the

14   normal cells of the bronchus.  Also identify

15   alveolar macrophages.  In other words, the alveolar

16   is the same as lung tissue, because lung tissue is

17   organized in sacs, or little bags, those bags are

18   called alveoli.  It's the medical term, but it's

19   nothing more than that.

20             And macrophages are like specialized

21   normal human cells that are specialized to entrap

22   any kind of garbage.  We � it's like � we call it

23   like the garbage trucks of the human body.  So every

24   environmental agent, including tobacco smoke,

25   pollution, everything we get every day in our lungs

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=63
3853

1   are destroyed and our engulfed by these macrophages.

2             So what this report is saying, yes, we did

3   see the bronchial cells.  Yes, we did see this of

4   normal bags, the alveolar bags, and, yes, we see

5   this macrophages and also we also see inflammation

6   in the area.  So there's something going on, it's

7   inflammation, and yes, we do not see the cancer

8   cells on this particular specimen.

9        Q.   Let me direct you to � well, you don't

10   need to go there.  You can look at tab 6 if you

11   want, but why are they doing this at all?

12             I mean, you explained why there was a

13   biopsy of lung tissue.  What are they doing in the

14   bronchus and why would they look in the bronchus if

15   the mass is in the lung?

16        A.   Well, they are looking, actually, at the

17   lung.  They went � that's � the way you get to the

18   lung is through the bronchus.  So the � the main

19   reason for � for this technique and for this

20   investigation is exactly what was, we discussed an

21   hour ago, that you, a patient � every patient with

22   a mass needs to have that mass investigated.  You

23   need to know what is going okay.  It's benign, it's

24   malignant.  If it's malignant or a cancer, what kind

25   of cancer is it?  Is it lymphoma, is it germ cell,

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=64
3854

1   is it lung cancer, is it some other type of cancer,

2   is it metastatic?  And then once you have this

3   conclusion then you go ahead with the treatment

4   plan.

5        Q.   Let me � let me sharpen my question a

6   little bit.

7             In the event that there were cancer �

8   there was a cancer mass in the lung, based on your

9   experience, does that sometimes involve or invade

10   the bronchus such that the wash and brush would

11   actually show cancer cells?

12        A.   Usually what a surgeon sees when there is

13   a typical lung cancer in this area, you see that the

14   bronchus is not a normal, regular tube anymore.  The

15   bronchus is perforated.  The cancer, it's aggressive

16   and invades tissues; and if it's an

17   aggressive-invading cancer, is going to � usually

18   what the surgeon who is doing this procedure what

19   they are seeing, it's either an ulceration, so it's

20   like an ulcer you have on the skin, but you see the

21   ulceration because the tumor pops in the field of

22   vision or like a cauliflower, so it's something that

23   pops out and, you know, goes from inside the lung

24   into the lumen.  And that's how, more or less, a

25   tumor would involve that area.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=65
3855

1        Q.   Let me direct you to PMUP041831 at tab 10,

2   radiology report.  Did the physicians conduct a CT

3   scan of the chest?

4        A.   Correct.

5        Q.   And let's look at the � this covers two

6   areas, two CT scans, but for now let's skip the scan

7   of the abdomen and concentrate on the upper third of

8   this.

9             Tell us whether any of this was

10   significant to your opinion.

11        A.   Yes.  So CT scan � CT comes from the

12   computed tomography.  So it's a slicing, it's a

13   serial slicing of the lung with an imaging

14   technique.  It's considered a more detailed imaging

15   examination of the chest than the simple chest

16   x-ray.

17             And, actually, the conclusion is that

18   the � what they found, the � the imaging found a

19   5.5 centimeter diameter irregular mass lesion in the

20   posterior segment of the right upper lobe.

21             So it's more sophisticated if you want,

22   yes, it's in the right upper lobe, what we call the

23   "apex," but it's in the posterior � so it's in the

24   backside of the right upper lobe.

25             Also it says that there's no associated

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=66
3856

1   erosion of the neighboring rib.  Obviously, in that

2   area is rib number 1, number 2,    so you expect of the

3   lung cancer to get the tumor to invade the rib or

4   the bronchus or to be in a destructive lesion.

5             The impression of the exam, suspicious

6   mass, meaning suspicious means suspicious for

7   cancer, that is what is the translation.  Right

8   upper lobe with associated enlarged hilar nodes.

9        Q.   What is the significance, if any, of the

10   language, quote, "associated enlarged hilar nodes"?

11        A.   Nodes is the short for lymph nodes.  So we

12   have lymph nodes that are highly specialized organs

13   that are all over in our body that are draining all

14   the organs.  In other words, all the � as I

15   mentioned even before, garbage.

16             So lymph nodes, actually, they are a

17   drainage systems, they are like barricades along

18   different organs that are entrapping different

19   environmental, pollution agents, different foreign

20   substances, different microbes, different viruses,

21   and, ultimately, also different malignant cells.

22   Different cancer cells, like they are harboring in

23   this nodes, and we call it "metastatic lymph nodes."

24             So what this impression says is that,

25   number one, this mass is suspicious for cancer.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=67
3857

1   And, number two, that there are enlarged nodes,

2   lymph nodes, in the hilar area.  Hilum means it's

3   exactly where � how you can envision the lung, it's

4   exactly where all the vessels and all the tubes are

5   getting into the lung, that's called the hilum or

6   hilus.

7        Q.   Does the observation of enlarged hilar

8   nodes tell you anything about whether or not there

9   is lung cancer?

10        A.   No.

11        Q.   Can you tell us why not?  I mean, partly

12   you have �

13        A.   It's exactly what I mentioned �

14        Q.   � but explain what they do?

15        A.   � before, is lymph nodes could be

16   enlarged for various number of reasons.  And then

17   only a biopsy could answer your question.  In other

18   words, if you want to know why lymph nodes are

19   enlarged, you need to do a biopsy, so to sample

20   tissue from that node.  And this happens in patients

21   with cancer, they are going to have a different

22   procedure, go in for the lymph nodes to see is that

23   cancer positive in the nodes or not.

2 4        Q.   At any time does Dr. Shah feel, the

2 5       radiologist, make any observations that there is

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=68
3858

1   lung cancer, here?

2        A.   In � in this report there's no mention

3   of � of the lung cancer as an entity.

4        Q.   Can hilar nodes become enlarged as a

5   result of something other than lung cancer?

6        A.   That's the main reason we are consulted

7   during many surgeries of the lung, because the

8   surgeon could investigate an enlarged lymph node and

9   they need to find out the answer from us, from the

10   pathology, doing what we call frozen section

11   diagnosis.  If there's a node enlarged for � we

12   call it "reactive reasons," so for any kind of

13   benign reason, including pneumonia, what have you,

14   everything, or cancer.

15        Q.   Would pneumonia cause the lymph nodes to

16   be enlarged in this area?

17        A.   Any kind of � yes, any kind of

18   inflammation would cause the enlargement of the

19   nodes.

2 0        Q.   Let me ask you to look then at tab 6.

21       There's been � well, tell us about the biopsy of

2 2       the lymph node, the inguinal lymph node.  And I'm

2 3       directing you to PMUP Exhibit 041842 at tab 6, at

2 4       pages 21 and 2 in the lower right corner. 25        A.   Yes.  So this is a consultation note from

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=69
3859

1   Dr. Iyer saying that the patient also, besides this

2   lung mass, has a groin lymph node.  So in the left

3   inguinal area or the left groin, he has this swollen

4   area which is there for a long period of time.

5        Q.   Now, at this point, given what you've

6   seen, has a pattern developed in your mind or to a

7   physician looking at this about the symptomology,

8   that is, where these symptoms are occurring?

9        A.   It looks like the patient � I mean, the

10   only symptoms from � if we go in time, the only

11   systems are the neurological symptoms, the weakness

12   in the leg, the back pain.  Besides that I don't see

13   any symptoms.  The signs and the imaging reveal the

14   mass in the right upper lobe, and then the, you

15   know, the � if you want the � the third type of

16   abnormality is the mass located in left groin.

17        Q.   Did the doctor biopsy that left lymph

18   node?

19        A.   Yes.

2 0        Q.   Let me direct you to PMUP041842 at tab 11,

21       and ask you to describe for us his operative note

2 2       and what significance that may have had to you.

2 3                             First of all, he makes an observation on

2 4       the upper right �

25        A.   I'm sorry, this is � excuse me.

1        Q.   Take us through it if you will.

2        A.   You said tab 11?

3        Q.   I think so.  Go to the second page of

4   that.

5        A.   Okay.

6        Q.   Not the handwritten notes.

7        A.   Okay.  So this is the procedure.  This is

8   the � this is the biopsy � this is the biopsy of

9   that groin lesion.

10        Q.   Okay.  And tell us �

11        A.   So again, this is a description of the

12   technique.  He partially incised the tissue

13   underneath the skin.  That's what subcutaneous

14   tissue means.  Had some local bleeding control

15   there.  And then it says that he identified those

16   nodes that are large.  He dissected them.  And then

17   the entire dissection � after the dissection was

18   performed, he excises.  So he remove the nodes and

19   he send to pathology.  That's what this is.

2 0        Q.   Okay.  And under postoperative diagnosis

21       under number 1, in the upper right there, the second

2 2        group �

23        A.   Right.  So in the � in the postoperative

24   diagnosis, he is mentioning that there is a

25   metastatic large cell carcinoma involving the lymph

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=71
3861

1   node, possible lung primary on frozen section

2   diagnosis.

3             So what it says here, that the surgeon

4   took out these nodes and he send them to the frozen

5   section examination.

6        Q.   Right.  And what significance do you

7   attach to the observation possible lung primary?

8   Has he drawn any conclusions at this juncture?

9        A.   From this report, it says that the � from

10   the discussion of the frozen section team, they

11   believe that this might be a lung primary cancer.

12        Q.   But have they arrived at a conclusion of

13   whether it is or not?

14        A.   No.

15        Q.   Now, do you see that sedation was given by

16   Dr. Heindel at the beginning � under "Description

17   of procedure," "Patient was brought to the operating

18   room and IV sedation was given by Dr. Heindel."

19        A.   Correct.

2 0        Q.   And let me direct you to the page, the

21       left-hand page there.  Are those notes of

2 2       Dr. Heindel?

23        A.   The handwritten notes, yes.  It says, "The

24   mass in the right upper lobe," handwritten, and then

25   it says, "Discussed local IV � discussed local IV

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=72
3862

1   sedate."  The � something � "He understands and

2   agrees with our plan."

3        Q.   Let me next ask you to take a look at

4   tab � hang on here.  At tab 11, which is

5   specifically Dr. Heindel's dictation, PMUP041842.

6   Can we take a look at that for a moment?

7             Okay.  We've already covered that.  So let

8   me move on then.

9             Let's look at the pathology report at

10   tab 13, PMUP041797.  And this is the pathology

11   report of the inguinal lymph node; is that correct?

12        A.   Uh-huh, yes.  That's correct.

13        Q.   And you mentioned earlier frozen section.

14   Is that what we are seeing that's in the upper left?

15        A.   Yes.  Can I explain to the jury what the

16   frozen section is?

17        Q.   Yes, please.

18        A.   Maybe they are not familiar with that.

19        Q.   Sure.

20        A.   The pathologist as part of our

21   examination, we are involved in doing two types of

22   diagnosis.  One is called the regular diagnosis.  So

23   each one of us, when we have a lump or we need a

24   biopsy, we go to the doctor, the doctor is doing the

25   biopsy.  They send a piece of tissue.  They put it

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=73
3863

1   in a tube, they send it to us.

2             That piece of tissue is going to have �

3   it's submitted to a different series of processing

4   steps.  It's like you want � if you want � it's

5   put in like in a washing machine.  It's a 24-hour we

6   call it processing.  So there are multiple solutions

7   that piece of tissue is treated with.

8             And then at the end overnight, it's

9   removed from there and it's put in paraffin.  So

10   it's embedded like in a wax, like it's a candle.

11             And then the technicians or the

12   technologists, they come and they slice those slices

13   very thin, it's a 5-micron thin slice.  So those

14   slices, it's thinner than a cell.  And then again

15   it's processed.

16             So this entire processing thing, the

17   duration is about 24 to 48 hours.  It's a lot of

18   like documentation involved, it's description, gross

19   description, everything is documented in a pathology

20   report.  That is the regular slide or the regular

21   diagnosis.

22             However, what else we do, we � it's

23   called frozen section.  It's something that is done

24   immediately when the patient is in the operating

25   room.  And the frozen section diagnosis is done in

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=74
3864

1   20 minutes or less.

2             And the reason, a frozen section is not as

3   much for the, you know, the slide to look beautiful

4   and pretty and to be processed for 48 hours, but to

5   be able to render the surgeon an immediate diagnosis

6   and immediate answer to his question.

7             Most of the surgeon question is, is that

8   cancer or not?  So frozen section has a different

9   connotation than we called it permanent section.

10             Whenever you see a frozen section report,

11   that means that I, as the pathologist, walked into

12   this surgery suite, take the tissue he has, and then

13   I cut it immediately myself and put it there under

14   the microscope.

15             So you are going to notice there are some

16   reports, pathology reports, they have a preliminary

17   frozen section, but the final diagnosis is actually

18   after all these days, as I mentioned before.

19             So that's the distinction between the

20   frozen section, actually, it's called frozen because

21   instead of using the wax, we use like ice of cubes.

22   So that piece of tissue, it's embedded in some � a

23   fancy gel that freezes immediately, and then I cut

24   the gel with a 5-micron thing.

2 5        Q.   In the interest of time, I'm going to move

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=75
3865

1   through this a little more quickly.  But let's look

2   at PMUP041 � well, first of all, on this document,

3   what is the significance of the observation at the

4   top, "Lymph node left groin for frozen section,

5   metastatic large cell undifferentiated malignancy."

6   Was does that mean?

7        A.   This is a very important piece of

8   information.  And what I'm saying is important is

9   that what the pathologist is seeing, it's a very

10   ugly-looking tumor.  It's a cancer that the

11   pathologist, she could not say, so Dr. Janice

12   Herbert, she could not � by looking at the tumor,

13   she cannot say it's a lymphoma, she cannot say it's

14   a carcinoma.  The only thing what she can say, it's

15   not a small cell cancer, and also, it's

16   undifferentiated.

17             In other words, it doesn't have any

18   adenocarcinoma differentiation, it doesn't have any

19   squamous differentiation, it doesn't have any

20   lymphoma differentiation.  It's exactly what I said

21   before a couple hours ago.  It's a very primitive

22   undifferentiated tumor.

2 3        Q.   Now let me direct you to PMUP041831 at

2 4       tab 14.  She has in fact a follow-up pathology

2 5       report, does she not?

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=76
3866

1        A.   Right.  So because the pathologist says

2   it's undifferentiated, they are trying to use

3   additional testing, we call it ancillary tests, to

4   find out what is the origin of this particular

5   tumor.

6             So the pathologist said they are going to

7   do � we are going to do different particular

8   special stains to answer this question.

9             So what stains they did.  They did

10   alpha-fetoprotein, which were negative.  This is a

11   stain that usually is positive in germ cell tumors,

12   so patients that have testicular tumors or germ cell

13   tumors, we call them, are positive for

14   alpha-fetoprotein.

15             They also did special stains for mucin, so

16   if that tumor produces mucin, this stain is going to

17   be positive.

18             They also did stains for high molecular

19   weight keratin.  Any carcinoma in the human body is

20   positive for keratin.  So if the patient has

21   keratin-positive tumor or pancytokeratin or CEA, if

22   they are positive, that means this is not a lymphoma

23   and this is not a germ cell tumor.

24             And that's the meaning of the third

25   sentence there, this staining characteristic, so the

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=77
3867

1   entire cluster of this panel of stains are

2   characteristic of adenocarcinoma.

3        Q.   And the net result of all of this is that

4   the pathologist is saying that the inguinal lymph

5   node does in fact contain cancer and it's an

6   adenocarcinoma?

7        A.   Correct.

8        Q.   Was there any observation at any time of

9   lung cancer by the pathologist?

10        A.   No.

11        Q.   Did Dr. Shah say at any time that this was

12   lung primary?

13        A.   Dr. Shah was � let me see.

14        Q.   Well, his progress notes are at tab 15.

15   PMUP041842.

16        A.   He said that this was discussed with the

17   pathologist with Dr. Herbert with a lymph node

18   biopsy, and this was consistent with an

19   adenocarcinoma with metastasis to brain and lymph

20   nodes.

21        Q.   Okay.  Let me direct you now back to the 2 2       other scan that was done � well, to the bone scan. 23       And it's tab 17 in your book, but it's PMUP041797.

2 4                             Just tell us what significance, if any,

2 5       you attach to the radiologist's observations here.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=78
3868

1        A.   This bone scan report shows that there's

2   involvement by cancer in the left hemipelvis, which

3   is here on the iliac crest, in this area, the lower

4   buttock area inside, and also from the right skull,

5   frontal parietal region is exactly here in the

6   skull.

7        Q.   So at this point, there is direct

8   observation and evidence of cancer in the left

9   inguinal lymph node, in the skull, and in the left

10   hemipelvis; is that correct?

11        A.   Correct.  This is what increased uptake

12   means, that it's positive.

13        Q.   Okay.  So what primary site is most

14   likely � well, let's take a look at � let me see.

15             MR. WARE:  Excuse me, Your Honor, may I

16        have just a moment?

17     BY MR. WARE

18        Q.   To your knowledge, did Mr. Duignan ever

19   have a pelvic CT?

20        A.   Yes.  He had an abdominal CT.

21        Q.   All right.  Did he ever have an abdominal 2 2       ultrasound?

23        A.   I don't recollect the ultrasound.  I

24   recollect the abdominal CT.

2 5        Q.   To your knowledge, did he ever have a

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=79
3869

1   colonoscopy?

2        A.   No, he did not.

3        Q.   Let me direct you to PMUP041831 at tab 19.

4             What observations do you make about

5   Dr. Roberts' notes of October 5th, 1992, and what

6   importance do they have, if any, to your opinion?

7        A.   Yeah.  He says that the patient

8   experienced pain and also experienced rectal

9   bleeding.  And to discontinue Motrin.

10        Q.   And what is the importance of those

11   observations to you?

12        A.   Well, the patient has symptomatology of

13   colorectal origin.  He has a rectal bleeding.  He

14   also has a mass in that area.  And the node, at

15   least the message I understand from this note is to

16   discontinue Motrin, which might give you like an

17   upper GI bleeding.

18        Q.   When you say "upper GI," you mean what?

19        A.   Stomach.  Motrin is one of the

20   noninflammatory � it's an NSAID or �

21        Q.   Nonsteroidal �

22        A.   Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug which

23   is taken for pain, and usually as a side effect, it

24   produces bleeding in the upper gastric area.

2 5        Q.   In your opinion, would Motrin or any NSAID

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=80
3870

1   produce bleeding in the rectum itself?

2        A.   No.  Actually, that bleeding has a

3   complete different quality than the bleeding of the

4   rectum.

5        Q.   Let me just ask you quickly to go back to

6   tab 10 and to the CT scan of the abdomen, and tell

7   us what observations you make.

8        A.   Yes.  So on the CT scan �

9        Q.   Let's look at the lower half, Brian.

10        A.   The report also is very interesting

11   because it reveals another abnormality, and that's

12   the soft tissue mass density, which is noted in the

13   left � metastases you are going to see there,

14   right, but actually the impression, the final

15   diagnosis is down � it says, "Mass in the left

16   flank which may represent mesenteric metastases."

17             Mesenteric means the fat that covers the

18   belly, the gastro � the tube, the colon.  So

19   mesentery actually is the adipose tissue that

20   protects our colon, the large bowel, and the small

21   bowel.  And this is called mesentery.

22             And actually what this imaging report

23   says, that there is indeed also mass in the left

24   flank � flank is the left side of the abdomen

25   inside the belly � which is a mesenteric

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=81
3871

1   metastases.

2        Q.   All right.  Now, above that it says "right

3   flank."

4        A.   Yes.

5        Q.   But you're saying given that its

6   conclusion says "left flank," you believe this to be

7   indicating a mass in the left flank.

8        A.   Right.  And, you know, multiple other � I

9   think other reports are clarifying this, that this

10   is in the left side and not the ride side.

11        Q.   All right.

12             Do you attach any particular significance

13   to that mass in the mesentery in terms of your own

14   opinion?

15        A.   Yes.  It's a significant finding that �

16   now, Mr. Duignan has a widespread disease, has a

17   large mass in the lower side of the abdomen, he has

18   a large mass which is still undiagnosed in the right

19   lung, right upper lung.  He also have � has brain

20   metastasis.  He has bone involvement in the skull,

21   and also bone involvement in the pelvis by cancer.

22   He also has this lymph node groin metastatic

23   disease.

24             So it's a picture which is � the picture

25   of, you know, a poor man who is a young man who is

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=82
3872

1   devastated by this extremely aggressive cancer.

2        Q.   Let me ask you to take a look at some

3   correspondence from Dr. Brant, the first being

4   PMUP041831 at tab 20 in the notebook before you.

5             First of all, let me ask you � let me

6   direct you to � this is a letter to Dr. Rao; is

7   that correct?

8        A.   Yes, that's correct.

9        Q.   Who was one of the treating physicians for

10   Mr. Duignan?

11        A.   Yes, that's correct.

12        Q.   All right.  And just show the address just

13   above that.

14             All right.  And to the right upper right

15   of that, it shows the date September 23, 1992; is

16   that correct?

17        A.   Correct.

18        Q.   And then I'd like to ask you about the

19   first two lines.  Tell us what the significance of 2 0       the referral note is.

21        A.   This sentence actually establishes on one

22   hand the diagnosis; on the other hand, the

23   consideration for therapy.

24             Many of the patients with terminal cancer

25   that involves the brain or bone, usually as a last

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=83
3873

1   resort they have radiation.  So what happens,

2   radiation, when metastases to the brain, if they are

3   radiated, actually they shrink the tumor, and this

4   helps the terminally-ill patient to ease up on the

5   neurological symptoms.

6             And this is � this is what I'm saying.

7   The point of it is � it says, you know, "Thank you

8   for referring Mr. Duignan for consideration of

9   irradiation for widely metastatic adenocarcinoma

10   with brain metastases."

11             So that's the diagnosis of Mr. Duignan's

12   condition.

13        Q.   And when you say that's the diagnosis,

14   what is the diagnosis as you read it as a physician?

15        A.   As a physician, this is a � as I

16   mentioned before, a carcinoma, extremely aggressive,

17   undifferentiated, and it's involving many organs and

18   systems in the body.

19        Q.   If Dr. Brant were of the view that this 2 0       was primary lung cancer, would you expect to see

21   some different description in that referral note?

22        A.   Yeah, I would.  It's � this doesn't look

23   like a picture of � a typical picture of a typical

24   patient with a primary lung carcinoma.

2 5        Q.   Would you expect to have seen some

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=84
3874

1   reference to primary lung cancer in that referral

2   note?

3        A.   I would expect to see a pathology report

4   that specifically states that this is specifically a

5   primary lung carcinoma, yes, that's what I would

6   suspect.

7        Q.   Now, let's go down that first page and

8   look at a little more information that's here.

9             What is Dr. Rao being told here?  I mean,

10   without belaboring this, he is being given a

11   history, Dr. Rao is being given a history by

12   Dr. Brant of Dr. Brant's inspection or review of

13   this patient; is that right?

14        A.   Right.  I mean, it's a detailed � exactly

15   what we talk about up to now.  It's � this is a

16   detailed medical description of the patient, of

17   Mr. Duignan, previous medical files concisely

18   explaining the involvement of his cancer.

19        Q.   And let's go to the second page, if we

2 0       could, and specifically to the highlighted section. 21                            Dr. Brant refers to his, again, quote,

2 2       impression.  And tell us what observation he makes

2 3       and how you read that as a specialist in cancer

2 4       diagnosis. 25        A.   He, you know, states, you know, the other

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=85
3875

1   ones, and then he states � he stated himself in the

2   beginning of the report that this is a carcinoma, a

3   fully differentiated carcinoma involving brain and

4   bone, and he is offering his hypothesis of probable

5   this is a lung cancer diagnosis.

6        Q.   Does he anywhere state his conclusion

7   definitively that he believes it's lung primary?

8        A.   No, he does not.

9        Q.   Let me next direct to you PMUP41831 at

10   tab 21, which is a later summary of treatment from

11   Dr. Brant.  Are you familiar with that document?

12        A.   Yes, I am.

13        Q.   And what does � what observations does

14   Dr. Brant make two days before the death of

15   Mr. Duignan, having treated him for seven or eight

16   days?

17        A.   So Dr. Brant concisely concluding � is

18   concluding the diagnosis of Mr. Duignan, that being

19   a widely metastatic adenocarcinoma of uncertain

20   primary.

21             If you remember, this is one of the

22   condition I discussed at the beginning in this

23   morning, that this is a cancer that we don't know

24   where it's coming from, that's why it's called

25   carcinoma of uncertain primary.

1        Q.   Now, let me just ask you to look at

2   Dr. Heindel's notes, which appear in your notebook

3   at tab 22.  And this is PMUP � what is it?  041843.

4             Dr. Heindel, just to remind us, was the �

5   was the physician who was the anesthetist �

6        A.   Anesthesiologist, yes.

7        Q.   � that did the lymph node biopsy,

8   correct?

9        A.   Correct.

10        Q.   So he had seen this patient previously,

11   right?

12        A.   Right.  And on 25th of September of 1992,

13   he documents in Mr. Duignan's chart that Mr. Duignan

14   is a 42-year-old white male with a known large cell

15   cancer with unknown primary.  He also has mets or

16   metastases to brain, lung, abdomen, and left

17   hemipelvis.

18        Q.   As you read that record, what was

19   Dr. Heindel's understanding of the primary site of 2 0        cancer?

21        A.   That this is an unknown primary cancer.

22   In other words, it's one of those categories of

23   cancer that we don't know where the cancer is coming

24   from, the origin.

2 5        Q.   Now, he goes on to describe that he's

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=87
3877

1   specifically been asked by other treaters to look at

2   the patient at this point, isn't that so?

3        A.   That's correct.

4        Q.   And tell us what he says and what

5   observations you make.

6        A.   That � obviously, he's part of the

7   treating team that is participating in the care of

8   Mr. Duignan.  He was asked to evaluate the patient

9   and to give his advice on his terminal disease of

10   releasing the pain.

11        Q.   Basically, what's an epidural steroid

12   injection?

13        A.   It's a � it's a type of injection with a

14   compound or a steroid agent that will decrease the

15   inflammation, and this way it will alleviate some of

16   the pain that these patients have from involvement

17   of the bone metastases by the spine.

18        Q.   Let me next go back to your summary of

19   opinions, if I may. And I want to ask you, based on 2 0       your experience as a board-certified pathologist and 21       your experience in the pathology of pulmonary

2 2       disease and cancer, do you have an opinion as to a

2 3       reasonable degree of medical certainty whether

2 4       Mr. Duignan's cancer was lung primary?

25                  A.   Yes, I have an opinion about that.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=88
3878

1        Q.   And what is that opinion?

2        A.   That the definitive diagnosis of lung

3   cancer primary was not established.

4        Q.   And what diagnosis, based on your

5   observations and experience, what is the appropriate

6   diagnosis of Mr. Duignan's condition at this time?

7        A.   The most likely diagnosis is of CUP, or

8   carcinoma of unknown primary origin.

9        Q.   And in the absence of knowing for sure

10   what the primary site is, can you say, can anyone

11   say whether or not smoking was a cause of cancer?

12             MR. PAIGE:  Objection, Your Honor.

13        A.   We cannot.

14             MR. PAIGE:  Calls for speculation as to

15        what other people are saying.

16             THE COURT:  Overruled.

17        A.   No, we cannot say.

18     BY MR. WARE

19        Q.   Why can we not say?

20        A.   Because we know for sure that there are

21   some cancers that are induced by smoking and some

22   others that are not.

23             So in this case we know that if there's no

24   certainty about a final diagnosis of lung cancer,

25   you cannot say that this is a cancer induced by

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=89
3879

1   smoking.

2        Q.   In coming to your conclusion that this is

3   not � or that this is � that lung cancer was not

4   established, but it is cancer of unknown primary,

5   can you tell us what your reasons are, and in that

6   respect, let me direct to you one more

7   demonstrative.

8             You can talk freely about this if this is

9   helpful to you.

10        A.   Yeah, I think it's � the fact that the

11   pathologist sees a cancer, in particular

12   adenocarcinoma, all the adenocarcinomas in the human

13   body, they look the same.

14             So I've been asked this question by many

15   of my surgeons, it's like, tell me if this is from

16   lung or tell me if this is from colon.  It's not

17   possible to say by simply looking at the microscope.

18   If there's a lung primary or not.

19             Number two, the pathologist, you know, and

20   I fully agree with both pathologists in this case in

21   this instance, that when you deal with a cell which

22   is extremely aggressive, which is undifferentiated,

23   it looks so ugly that you cannot tell one way or the

24   other, it � it's almost impossible to say that, you

25   know, we are dealing with a lung carcinoma.

1             The clinical picture, the way that the

2   cancer � usually a lung cancer does not go to the

3   inguinal nodes.  This is very typical.  Also, the

4   entire picture of a �

5        Q.   Excuse me.  Did you say "typical" or

6   "atypical"?

7        A.   Atypical.  This is not typical.

8   Involvement of inguinal nodes is not typical of lung

9   cancer picture.

10             Also, the age of this patient is � you

11   know, I � I mentioned that in the morning, it's so

12   unusual that many other types of cancers come to

13   mind and not lung cancer.

14        Q.   When you say many other cancers come to

15   mind, what are some possibilities or a possibility

16   in this case based on your observations of the

17   records?

18        A.   You know, also in the differential

19   diagnosis it's colorectal cancer.  The patient has a

20   mesenteric mass.  There's some symptoms in there.

21   It's � it's well, you know, well, to, you know,

22   it's widespread to many sites of the body.  This is

23   in the differential diagnosis.  Obviously, lung

24   cancer is a differential diagnosis.

25             But the way this picture looks and the way

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=91
3881

1   the cells were described in this report and the way

2   the cancer spread, there were very many variables

3   that are not � they do not fit in the picture of

4   lung cancer.

5        Q.   Directing you to the last bullet point,

6   the symptoms or signs below the diaphragm, what's

7   the significance of that beyond what you said?

8        A.   They are minimal.  As pathologists, we

9   don't rely on the symptoms in the diagnosis of

10   cancer.  A patient could have symptoms of � could

11   have widely metastatic cancer and not have any

12   symptoms.  So the fact that someone has or has not

13   symptoms is not directing anyone into the direction

14   of cancer or not.

15        Q.   And I think finally, let me ask you to go

16   back to a question of unknown primary.  What are the

17   characteristics of cancer of unknown primary that

18   you believe you observed in this record?

19        A.   The majority of the times the carcinomas

20   are unknown primary.  They present with widespread

21   disease; in other words, it's metastatic disease

22   from the get-go.  They are undetectable after the

23   clinical and pathological investigation; in other

24   words, you cannot prove any direction � or any area

25   of differentiation whatsoever or origin.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=92
3882

1             They are extremely poorly differentiated.

2   So they are aggressive cancers.  They kill the

3   patient almost in a matter of months.  That's the

4   reason, you know, it's said � it's stated there

5   that they are undifferentiated or poorly

6   differentiated.

7             And statistically speaking, the majority

8   of these carcinomas of unknown primary or CUPs are

9   adenocarcinoma; in other words, they are derived

10   from some mucin-producing glands.

14        Q.   Just one further question.  What is the

15   most likely source of metastatic disease to the

16   mesentery?

18   colorectal cancer.

3        Q.   Good morning, sir.

4        A.   Good morning.

5        Q.   My name is Gary Paige.  You and I met one

6   time before today at your deposition.

7        A.   Correct.

8        Q.   And I had the pleasure of meeting you in

9   the hallway.  So obviously I have some questions for

10   you.

11        A.   Likewise.

12        Q.   And I need the deposition.

13             Just to be clear, you're a pathologist,

14   you made that pretty clear, but I still have some

15   questions that I want to lead into here.  But you're

16   a pathologist, right?

17        A.   Correct.

18        Q.   And what you're saying is from pathology,

19   especially today, there are ways that you could

2 0       diagnose with certainty whether it's lung cancer,

21   primary or not, right?

22          A.   Right.

2 3                  Q.   And we can't say today with 100 percent

2 4       certainty this is a lung primary, correct?

4        Q.   I'm sorry?

5        A.   Correct.

6        Q.   Okay.  And so as a pathologist, you

7   don't � you don't engage in the clinical aspect of

8   the diagnosis, right?

9        A.   The diagnosis is � is established by the

10   discipline of pathology.  So that's not correct.

11             What is correct is that pathologists, us

12   as pathologists, we are the discipline that is

13   involved in rendering the diagnosis to other

14   disciplines.

15        Q.   Okay.  I understand from the pathology.

16   I'm trying to get to another part of the team here.

17        A.   Okay.

18        Q.   I'm just asking you a question, a simple

19   question, respectfully.  As a pathologist, you don't 2 0       engage in the clinical aspects of the diagnosis,

21   correct?

22        A.   I don't know what � could you be more

2        A.   Yes, we did.

3        Q.   And how many lawyers did you meet with to

4   review your testimony?

5        A.   Three.

6        Q.   Three different lawyers.

7             And so Mr. Ware, I'm assuming was there,

8   correct?

9        A.   Yes, correct.

10        Q.   I'm not going to guess who the other two

11   were.  But you all reviewed the deposition again,

12   right?

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   And so I'll just ask you the question.

15   You don't do the clinical diagnosis, correct?

16        A.   If you are more specific what a clinical

17   diagnosis, because I'm not sure what you're

18   referring to.

19        Q.   On page 199 of your deposition, at line 12 2 0       through 20, I asked you:

21                             "Question:  The clinical part of the

2 2        diagnosis is done by clinician, an oncologist,

2 3        and a pulmonologist, correct?"

2 4                             And you answered:

2 5                              "Answer:  Correct."

1             And I say:

2             "Question:  You don't � you don't do

3        that?"

4             You said:

5             "Answer:  I do the pathologic diagnosis."

6             And I said:

7             "Question:  You don't do the clinical

8        diagnosis, correct?"

9             And you said:

10             "Answer:  No."

11             Do you remember giving those answers,

12   Doctor?

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   Okay.  So that's what I was talking about.

15             And a pathologist is a doctor who looks

16   at � I think you explained it � is a doctor who

17   looks at tissue and body fluids under a microscope,

18   right?

19        A.   Yes.  Also a pathologist looks at the � 2 0        Q.   General speaking.

21        A.   � all the components in the blood, so a

22   pathologist widely also investigating the laboratory

23   part of -- of the diagnosis as well.

2 4        Q.   Right.  And, again, I'm not critical of

2 5       you, but in this case you didn't have an opportunity

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=99
3889

1   to do that, right?

2        A.   I have the opportunity to do what?

3        Q.   To look under the microscope and look at

4   the tissue in this case, correct?

5        A.   The tissue doesn't exist anymore.

6        Q.   Right.  And that's � and you said at one

7   point, I wrote it down, you said implicit � "it's

8   implicit for the pathologist to state the primary

9   site on pathology," you said that at one point in

10   direct?

11        A.   Correct.

12        Q.   And you meant, if a pathologist can

13   determine that, correct?  Sometimes � and that's

14   what I'm going to get into.

15             If a pathologist can determine the primary

16   site on pathology, that's something you'll write on

17   a report?

18        A.   As a pathologist, we can do that most of

19   the time.  Sometimes, however, we cannot do that

20   because, you know, all of the other disciplines look

21   at us as the gold standard of pathology and

22   diagnosis.  We cannot say 100 percent for sure in

23   few times because the science is not black or white. 2 4 Q. All right. Doctor, I apologize. And it's 2 5       probably my fault, I'm not following you.

1        A.   Yes.

2        Q.   I'm just trying to ask you a simple

3   question, because I have a couple of follow-up

4   questions to ask about it.

5             But there are certain times when a

6   pathologist cannot determine by stating the primary

7   site of the cancer, correct?

8        A.   In those instances �

9        Q.   No.  I'm just asking you, is that correct

10   or, not, and then � and then I don't �

11        A.   I will be happy to answer your question.

12        Q.   Can you answer me that's correct, and

13   then, respectfully, you can explain.

14             Is that �

15        A.   The way �

16        Q.   Does that sound fair to you?

17        A.   The way the pathologist is making a

18   diagnosis in cases �

19             THE COURT:  Doctor, it was really a

20        yes-or-no question.

21             THE WITNESS:  Okay.

22             THE COURT:  You can answer yes or no.

23        Mr. Paige said you can explain after you answer

24        yes or no.

25             THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Okay.  Could you

3891

1        repeat the question?

2             THE COURT:  Yes, yes, I'm sorry.

3             MR. PAIGE:  Agreed.

4     BY MR. PAIGE

5        Q.   And, again, my apologies, maybe it's me,

6   because you understand I'm doing the best I can.

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   And a lot of this is �

9        A.   Yeah.

10        Q.   � probably above my intellect, so I'm

11   doing the best I can.

12             So my question to you is simply if you

13   could explain to me �

14        A.   Yes.

15        Q.   � you would agree there are certain

16   times � and I'm going to talk about today and back

17   in 1992 �

18        A.   Right.

19        Q.   � but I just want to get a general

2 0       basis � there are times when a pathologist cannot

21       determine by stating what the primary site is,

2 2        right?

23                  A.   Correct.

2 4                  Q.   All right.  Thank you.

2 5                             And in the field of pathology there have

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=102
3892

1
	been advances in the past 20 years to determine the
	
2
	primary s
	ite by pathology that were not available

3
	when Mr. ]
	Kevin Duignan's father was around, correct?

4
	A.
	Correct.

5
	Q.
	This was 20, 25 years ago when things were

6
	different
	in medicine, right?

7
	A.
	Correct.

8
	Q.
	And had we had the staining that is

9
	available
	now, had they had that staining, and they

10
	stained the biopsy from the left � I'm going to
	
11
	mess this
	word up � the inguinal.

12
	A.
	Inguinal, yes.

13
	Q.
	The inguinal node, it's very possible that

14
	that today, if we did that staining, that might tell
	
15
	us it's a
	lung primary, right?

16
	A.
	It might or it might not.

17
	Q.
	Right.

18
	A.
	It's possible yes or it's possible not.

19
	Q.
	Right.  We don't know, right?

20
	A.
	We don't know, yes.

21
	Q.
	And so then when Mr. Duignan was alive,

22
	the tests
	that you use today to determine the

23
	primary s
	ite were not available, right?

24
	A.
	Some of them were not, yes.

25
	Q.
	All right.  And so there was a board that

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=103
3893

1   said one of the reasons he didn't have primary lung

2   cancer was no pulmonary symptoms, but we agree, I

3   think you clarified that, you said it's very common

4   that people can have Stage IV lung cancer primary

5   without respiratory symptoms.

6        A.   They can have any kind of cancer with

7   Stage IV symptomatology is not specific.

8        Q.   Okay.  And you talked about tumor boards

9   in direct examination, right?

10        A.   Correct.

11        Q.   And in cases where the pathology is of

12   uncertain, right, cases where staining doesn't tell

13   you or cases where we didn't have the staining

14   available at that time, when that occurs, you defer

15   and rely upon clinicians, like pulmonologists and

16   oncologists, correct?

17        A.   No, that's not correct.

18        Q.   It's not.  Okay.

19             If you can look at your deposition and if 2 0       you could turn to page 199, line 8.  I asked you: 21                             "Question:  Clinically, do you know

2 2        whether an oncologist can diagnose lung

2 3        cancer?"

2 4                              You said:

2 5                             "Answer:  There is � there is a clinical

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=104
3894

1        part of diagnosis."

2             And then I said to you:

3             "Question:  And so the clinical part of

4        the diagnosis is done by a clinician, like an

5        oncologist or a pulmonologist, correct?"

6             And you said.

7             "Answer:  Correct."

8             Then I said:

9             "Question:  You don't do that, correct?"

10             And you said:

11             "Answer:  I do the pathological

12        diagnosis."

13             And I said:

14             "Question:  Right.  You don't do the

15        clinical diagnosis, correct?"

16             And you said:

17             "Answer:  No."

18             And then I said:

19             "Question:  If the pathology is uncertain, 2 0                  you have to defer and rely upon clinicians,

21        correct?"

22        A.   So I �

2 3                  Q.   Sir, can I finish?

24                  A.   Yeah.  Sure.

2 5                  Q.   And so you were under oath when I asked

3895

1
	you that,
	and you � you know this is a � sir �

2
	A.
	Yes, sir.

3
	Q.
	� you know this is a serious case, right?

4
	A.
	Yes, I do.

5
	Q.
	And when you gave your deposition it was

6
	important
	that you reviewed everything, correct?

7
	A.
	I think you misread my words.  So can

8
	you � can � can I take a minute, I would like to
	
9
	read with
	you �

10
	Q.
	Sir, let me �

11
	A.
	� because I said � you asked me for an

	Okay.  Let me finish.

14
	
	"Question:  You don't do the clinical

15
	diagnosis, correct?
	
16
	
	"Answer:  No."

17
	A.
	Can you � can you tell me what page to

18
	look at?
	

19
	Q.
	I'm still on page 199.  And then it goes

20
	on:
	

21
	
	"Question:  If the pathology is uncertain,

22
	you !
	lave to defer and rely upon clinicians,

23
	correct?"
	
24

2        Q.   Then I go on:

3             "Question:  Like Dr. Burns, who is a

4        pulmonologist; correct?"

5             And you said:

6             "Answer:  Correct."

7             Then I asked you again, on page 185, we

8   went over it another time.

9             MR. WARE:  Your Honor, I object.  There

10        are other parts of page 199 that need to be

11        covered here.  The very page Counsel is reading

12        from.

13             THE COURT:  Okay.

14             MR. PAIGE:  I don't know what he is

15        referring to.

16             THE COURT:  Well, he can tell us.  You can

17        just read them, if you will.  Identify the page

18        and line and proceed and read them now.

19             MR. WARE:  All right.  Page 199, beginning

20        at line 4.

21             "Question:  So you believe as an expert

22        that an oncologist cannot diagnose lung cancer,

23        right?

4        diagnosis."

5             Next question:

6             "Question:  And so the clinical part of

7        the diagnosis is done by a clinician, like an

8        oncologist?

13        that's the point I was making.

14     BY MR. PAIGE

15        Q.   And then again on page 185, line 9 through

16   23, I asked you:

17             "Question:  Can you say this is probably

18        not a lung primary, or do you not know one way

19        or the other because the pathology, they didn't 2 0                  do the markers that we have today?"

21                            And you answered you don't know one way or

2 2   the other.

2 3                             And I asked you:

13        Q.   And so just to be clear, you, as a

14   pathologist, are unable to rule out that this

15   gentleman had a lung primary, correct?

16        A.   Correct.

17        Q.   Okay.  And in looking at the medical

18   records, you noted that there were several

2 0       clinicians � physicians, clinicians, who cared for

21       this gentleman when he was dying, rendered

2 2       treatment, were doing the best they could, and they

2 3       thought � they couldn't tell with 100 percent

	was a lung primary, correct?

	A.
	It is inaccurate what you're saying.

4
	Q.
	Okay.  Then again � and, by the way, when

1             Your answer at that time was:

2             "Answer:  Yes."

3             Do you remember giving that answer under

4   oath, Doctor?

5        A.   Wait a minute and I can tell you.

6             I have here page 75 is saying that, "Do

7   you see any" �

8             THE COURT:  Line 17 to 19.  17, 18 and 19.

9        That's all he read.

10        A.   Right.  Okay.

11     BY MR. PAIGE

12        Q.   Do you see that?

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   Okay.  Did I read that correctly into the

15   record?

16        A.   Yes.

17        Q.   Okay.  And many of the doctors who treated

18   this gentleman, who were caring for him, who thought

19   that he had primary lung cancer, included doctors 2 0       like Dr. Iyer, Dr. Parikh, Dr. Roberts, Dr. Brant,

21   Dr. Rao, correct?

22        A.   No, it's not correct.  Actually, Dr. Iyer

23   expressed multiple opinions about this, and his

24   opinion is, you know, as I mentioned before in the

25   morning, he says that he has widely metastatic

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=111
3901

1   carcinoma.  Then he goes back down some of this �

2   this letter to say "probable lung cancer."

3             So as all the other treating physicians,

4   he didn't know what the origin was of this, and then

5   he says "probable."  So he � again, he expresses

6   his uncertainty about the origin of it and as a

7   treating physician, yeah, I agree with you, he �

8   the patient is extremely ill, he is terminally ill.

9   He needs to make a decision about the treatment.

10             However, the diagnosis, so the gold

11   standard, as I mentioned in the morning, the two

12   pathologists that render a definitive diagnosis,

13   these are the physicians that make a diagnosis for

14   any � in any patient, it's not only Mr. Duignan.

15   And they said this is not a definitive lung cancer

16   diagnosis.

17        Q.   Okay.  I'm going to promise, I'm going to

18   go through some records with you.  Okay?

19        A.   Sure.

2 0        Q.   And my only question here, most

21       respectfully, is when you reviewed the records, you

2 2       saw in the records � the medical records that there

2 3       were many doctors who believed it was lung primary,

2 4       which included Dr. Iyer.

25                            MR. WARE:  Objection, we've just been over

1        this and read this.  It's been answered and

2        read.

3             THE COURT:  Do you want to �

4             MR. PAIGE:  I didn't understand his

5        answer, Your Honor.  I don't think that he

6        answered it.

7             THE COURT:  Well, I'm not sure you got �

8        maybe you didn't get to the question.

9             MR. PAIGE:  I'll rephrase it.

10             THE COURT:  So far it sounds like it was

11        asked and answered.

12     BY MR. PAIGE

13        Q.   Okay.  You saw in the records where

14   Dr. Iyer couldn't be certain, but he said "probably

15   lung cancer," correct?

16        A.   He said "probably lung cancer."  Right.

17        Q.   You don't have a problem with that,

18   correct?

19        A.   I have a problem with his interpretation,

20   but I don't � I saw the � the record.  He said

21   probable lung cancer.  But, obviously, I don't agree

22   with his interpretation.  That's true.

2 3                  Q.   Dr. Parikh, who treated the gentleman and

2 4       saw him and was reviewing all the records and films

2 5       of what was going on, he said "probable lung

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=113
3903

1       cancer,"   correct?

2        A.   Correct

3        Q

4        A

5        Q

Dr. Roberts said that, correct?

I don't remember that.

He is the gentleman who signed the death

6   certificate at the end that said "lung cancer caused

7   by smoking."

8             MR. WARE:  Objection.

9             THE COURT:  Approach � well, do you want

10        to approach?

11             MR. WARE:  No, that's okay, Your Honor.

12             THE COURT:  Okay.  It's withdrawn.

13     BY MR. PAIGE

14        Q.   You read the death certificate?

15        A.   Can � can I make a � a little comment?

16   I think we have a little less time.  We have a

17   problem in you understanding what the pathologist is

18   doing.

19             So in the treating � in the treating

20   environment where you have different people and

21   different specialized physicians that are coming to

22   care for a terminally ill patient with cancer, some

23   physicians have different expertise areas.  So a

24   pathologist is the expert, and is the � the

25   professional that renders the diagnosis.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=114
3904

1             So I think you have a difficult time and

2   even less time to grasp on the concept that someone

3   that treats the patient, like the oncologist, is not

4   diagnosing the patient.  We are, as pathologists, we

5   are the discipline to do that.

6             So I think it's, you know, I'm trying

7   maybe the jury to make understand what I � what I'm

8   trying to � because we, as pathologists, are not

9   very popular in the � in the treating team, because

10   nobody knows what we are doing.  But an oncologist,

11   or even a radiologist, cannot look at the

12   radiologist and say, is this �

13             MR. PAIGE:  Your Honor, respectfully.

14             THE WITNESS:  Can I finish my �

15             THE COURT:  Actually, sir, you have to

16        respond to questions.  You didn't � you are

17        not responding to a question now, so, most

18        respectfully, no, you can't continue.

19             THE WITNESS:  Okay.

20             THE COURT:  If the lawyer who has called

21        you feels that there's something to add to your

22        previous testimony in response to this, he will

23        have the opportunity to ask you about it on

24        redirect.  Right now it's � he asks and you

25        answer what he asks.

1             THE WITNESS:  Okay.

2             THE COURT:  Okay.

3     BY MR. PAIGE

4        Q.   And, Doctor, again, respectfully �

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   � I do understand a lot of what you're

7   saying, but my question is different.  So my

8   question is:  Did you review the death certificate?

9        A.   Yes, I did.

10        Q.   Okay.  Do you know the death certificate

11   was signed by Dr. Roberts, right?

12        A.   Okay.

13        Q.   Did you know that?

14        A.   Yes.

15        Q.   And he � he was the gentleman who

16   admitted to Mr. Duignan, and was the primary care

17   doctor who was coordinating a lot of the care and

18   treatment and talking to all the doctors, right?

19          A.   Right.

2 0                  Q.   Kind of like what you do on a tumor board,

21   right?

22        A.   I don't know if he did or not.  I don't

23   want to speculate what he did.

2 4                  Q.   Okay.  You saw where he was in the records

2 5       and he had talked to certain doctors, and was making

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=116
3906

1   notes, right?

2        A.   Right.

3        Q.   And that's what you kind of do when you're

4   on a tumor board, you talk to all the doctors,

5   right?

6        A.   Correct.

7        Q.   Different specialities, right?  Right?

8        A.   Correct.

9        Q.   And at the end Dr. Roberts signed the

10   death certificate and he said the probable cause,

11   not with certainty, but more likely than not, more

12   probable than not, the probable cause of

13   Mr. Duignan's death was what?

14        A.   The document you mean?

15        Q.   Lung cancer, right?

16        A.   In the death certificate, yes.  That's

17   correct.

18        Q.   From smoking, right?

19        A.   I don't know what it says, but if it's in

20   the certificate, yes.

21        Q.   And then also Dr. Rao, he was an

2 2       oncologist.  He put in the records that "probable

2 3       lung cancer," correct?

24        A.   Correct.

2 5        Q.   Okay.  And Dr. Brant, I know we have those

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=117
3907

1   two records, but we'll talk about that, he said it

2   was "probable lung cancer," right?

3        A.   He said "unknown primary."

4        Q.   That's not all he said, is it?

5        A.   So he had two impressions.  So one is lung

6   and the other one, he was the last to see the

7   patient before he died, he said the carcinoma of

8   unknown primary.

9        Q.   So the fact that he was the last to see

10   the patient before he died is important, right?

11        A.   What I'm saying is he had two conflicting

12   documents, that's what I'm saying.

13        Q.   Sir, the fact that you just brought out

14   that he was the last one to see the patient before

15   he died, that was important, right?

16        A.   It's important to look at the documents.

17   No, it's not.  It's not.  I don't �

18        Q.   You brought that out because he really was

19   not the last one to see the patient.  In fact, he 2 0       hadn't seen the patient for two � almost � about

21   two months before he wrote that note, right?

22        A.   That's actually, it's very important, yes. 2 3        Q.   And so �

24        A.   And he says it is an unknown primary.

2 5        Q.   The last one who saw him was Dr. Roberts,

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=118
3908

1   right?

2        A.   I don't know.  I have to look.

3        Q.   Okay.  And � but in any event � and you

4   read Dr. Brant's deposition since your deposition,

5   right?

6        A.   Yes, I did.

7        Q.   We talked about that.

8             And all these treating doctors, Dr. Iyer,

9   Parikh, Roberts, Brant, Rao, you don't have any

10   criticism of them whatsoever, correct?

11        A.   For what � how they treated the patient,

12   no, I don't have any criticisms.

13        Q.   Okay.

14             THE COURT:  Mr. Paige, I just want to

15        point out, we've got some flexibility, it's

16        about ten to 12:00.

17             MR. PAIGE:  Yeah, I'm starting a new

18        topic, so whatever Your Honor's pleasure.

19             THE COURT:  Well, do you have about a 10-

20        or 15-minute topic?  Do it, otherwise we'll

21        break now.

22             MR. PAIGE:  I'll try to do it in 10 � 10

23        minutes.

2 4                             THE COURT:  Okay.  Great.  Why don't you

25        do that, then we will take a lunch break.

	You're not saying � he had cancer, right?

3
	You're not saying he didn't have cancer, you're just
	
4
	saying,
	I don't know, maybe it wasn't lung cancer,

	right?
	

6
	A.
	It's documented by a pathology report,

7
	yes .
	

8
	Q.
	Okay.  And the fact that he was 42, you

	said that was young for somebody to have lung
	
10
	cancer,
	but that's young for somebody to have colon

11

	any cancer?

12
	A.
	That's absolutely correct.

13
	Q.
	Okay.  And without knowing what the

14
	primary
	site is, you said you can't determine if

	smoking
	causes cancer, correct?

16
	A.
	Correct.

17
	Q.
	But if his primary site � if he had

18
	primary
	lung cancer, you're not � you're not saying

19
	it wasn
	't from smoking, right?

20
	A.
	I'm not saying that.

21
	Q.
	Okay.  In fact, just when you put up lung

22
	cancer,
	whether he had lung cancer or not, you know

23
	he had a lot of exposures to carcinogens in his

	Correct.

1        Q.   And every time a smoker, like himself,

2   inhales smoke, they are exposing their lungs to

3   carcinogens, right?

4             MR. WARE:  Objection.

5        A.   Right.

6             THE COURT:  Overrule.

7     BY MR. PAIGE

8        Q.   And the chemicals and carcinogens that are

9   inhaled into the lungs � he was a teenager, 12, 13,

10   14 years old, in his 20s, in his 30s, and when he

11   was 40 �

12             THE COURT:  Counsel, why don't you

13        approach?

14              (Sidebar discussion held:)

15             THE COURT:  Do you have an objection to

16        this line of questioning?

17             MR. WARE:  Yes, this witness did not give

18        an opinion that smoking cannot cause cancer.

19        He gave an opinion about any absence of knowing

20        the primary site.  You can't say whether or not

21        smoking caused the cancer, so this litany of

22        questions about what smoke might do is not

23        responsive to the direct.  It's outside the

24        scope of what he was just disclosed for.

25             MR. PAIGE:  Your Honor, he said this could

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=121
3911

1        be lung cancer, this could be colon cancer and

2        the jury is going to evaluate all his possible

3        exposures to lung cancer versus the highly

4        unlikely chance of a 42-year-old man would have

5        colon cancer.

6             And, you know, I think it's, you know,

7        fair to show the reason why he did have primary

8        lung cancer, his clinicians �

9             THE COURT:  I think it's fair.  It's a

10        consideration, a diagnosis when considering

11        other primary sites, as I understand the

12        testimony, to what he may have been exposed to.

13        If it increases the likelihood one of those as

14        primary.

15             MR. WARE:  It doesn't � I mean, his

16        opinion is based on the pathology in the

17        records, not on whether smoking can cause

18        cancer, that's not in dispute.

19             THE COURT:  But he is �

20             MR. WARE:  He is not disclosed for this

21        purpose.

22             THE COURT:  Great.  But he did talk

23        about � he did talk about broader factors,

24        such as particularly age and, he did talk about

25        some kind of � I'll call it epidemiological

3912

1        things in terms of statistically who gets what.

2        And so the fact that this individual's medical

3        history or personal history skewed more toward

4        a particular kind of cancer, I'm going to let

5        him go.

6             MR. WARE:  This witness knows nothing

7        about his smoking history.

8             MR. PAIGE:  He did in his depo.  He knew

9        about it.

10             THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, don't discuss it

11        between the two of you.  I'm going to let you

12        ask � I'm going to let you ask � you've got

13        one more question.

14             MR. PAIGE:  I'm going to go through it

15        because they are saying because of his age he

16        got lung cancer, Your Honor, and that it was

17        very unlikely, and I want to show that his

18        exposures � I mean, I � the average age of

19        lung cancer is older, but the average

20        consumption of the cigarettes is less.

21             So here is a guy who says he couldn't have

22        lung cancer because he was younger, but he is

23        getting the same exposures of carcinogens as

24        someone who is older than him who smoked less

25        or started �

1             THE COURT:  I think � I think he is

2        entitled to address the environmental factors

3        as � in response to the testimony about the

4        age factor, you know, up to a point.  You know,

5        I don't want him waving the bloody shirt all

6        over again.

7             MR. WARE:  My only point is, he's not

8        given an opinion that smoking doesn't cause or

9        can't cause or even didn't cause it in

10        Mr. Duignan.

11             THE COURT:  Well, he testified that

12        it's � that smoking causes lung cancer, he

13        acknowledged that.

14             MR. WARE:  Right.  And so to go through a

15        litany of reasons based on Mr. Duignan's

16        personal smoking of how he was exposed is doing

17        nothing but reemphasizing in front of the jury

18        testimony that's already given.  So it's the

19        subject of his opinion.

20             THE COURT:  I'm sensitive to that and I

21        appreciate that viewpoint, but Mr. Paige's come

22        up with a separate and I think valid reason

23        vis-a-vis the testimony on direct as far as

24        age.  I'm going to let you do a little bit.

15        continuing objection for the record?

16             MR. WARE:  No, because the questions are

17        too specific.

2 2                  Q.   So, Doctor, and maybe I was pronouncing it

2 3   wrong, is it Chirieac or Chirieac?

24                  A.   Yes.

2 5                  Q.   I kept say Chirieac because of the H.  I

1   apologize.

2             And so the chemicals in carcinogens

3   inhaled into the lungs cause damage to the lungs,

4   which make it more likely that someone will get lung

5   cancer, correct?

6        A.   That's not correct.  Only 15 percent of

7   smokers develop lung cancer.  So it's not most

8   likely.

9        Q.   I said "more likely."  But you said

10   15 percent get lung cancer, but there's a lot of

11   other diseases that are caused by smoking, other

12   cancers as well; correct?

13        A.   So you're asking me about lung cancer?

14        Q.   My question to you � well, you brought up

15   statistics, but my question to you simply, Doctor,

16   was:  The chemicals in carcinogens in somebody who

17   smokes, inhales it through their lungs over time,

18   those millions of exposures can make it more likely

19   that somebody can get lung cancer, you learned that, 2 0       didn't you?

21        A.   It is not correct.  It's not more likely.

22   So the inhaling tobacco smoke is going to increase

23   the chances of lung cancer, this is correct.

24   However, only 15 percent of smokers get lung

25   cancers.  So it's not most likely.  So if you bring

1   in 100 smokers in this room, 15 will develop,

2   indeed, lung cancer.

3        Q.   Fifteen will get lung cancer, right?

4          A.   Yes.

5        Q.   Then other people will get other diseases,

6   like pancreatic cancer, stroke, heart disease,

7   50 percent of them get sick from the smoke, right?

8             MR. WARE:  Objection.

16        if somebody inhales them into their lungs, they

2 3                  Q.   And as you get more and more damage to the

25             MR. PAIGE:  Go ahead.

1             THE WITNESS:  Yes, I want to clarify �

2             THE COURT:  You said it's a different

3        question.

4             THE WITNESS:  Yes.

5             THE COURT:  Okay.

6        A.   What you asked me here on the depo is the

7   dose to tobacco smoke and the chances to develop

8   lung cancer.  However, what you asked me today is if

9   someone in the 40s is going to smoke, you know, like

10   a 35 pack-year versus someone in the 60 who has a 35

11   pack-year.  What I'm trying to clarify is the � the

12   dose is sufficient to induce lung cancer.  However,

13   the patients are not going to get lung cancer as

14   Mr. Duignan in the 40s.  So a patient that has,

15   let's say, for example, the � the risk of � for

16   the exposure of 35 pack-years, usually the same

17   patients, they develop, even if they quit, they

18   develop later on in the life.

19             So what I'm saying is, as the � the

20   exposure time and the exposure dose might be the

21   same, however, it's not like if someone smokes like

22   40 pack-year in the 40s he is going to develop lung

23   cancer in the 40s.  That's � that's what is

24   different than what you asked me here. 25

1     BY MR. PAIGE

2        Q.   He started at age 12, right?

3        A.   I don't know.  I know he has a significant

4   smoking history, yes.

5        Q.   And people get lung cancer at age 42 from

6   smoking, you already told us that, right?

7        A.   Yes.

8        Q.   And you're not saying that didn't happen

9   here, right?

10             You aren't saying that didn't happen, you

11   are saying you just don't know, right?

12        A.   Right.

13             MR. PAIGE:  Your Honor, you want to break

14        for lunch?

15             THE COURT:  Yes.

16             Is that � is that a straight enough

17        answer for you?

18             I've got � how about, can we try to

19        compress the lunch hour, like we did yesterday,

20        do you think that you can be back, ready to go

21        at 1:20, meet Deputy Schluger at 1:10?  I've

22        got about 12:08 now.  Is that � no problem?

23        No problem?  A problem?  No problem?  Okay.

24        That will be the plan.  We'll resume at 1:20.

25             Doctor, same deal as before, you're free

1   The following proceedings continued at 1:21 p.m.:

2             COURT DEPUTY:  All rise.  Court is back in

3        session.  Please be seated.

4             THE COURT:  Okay.  Are we all set?

5             MR. MOLONY:  Your Honor, before we bring

6        the jury in if I might.  We've been doing our

7        dead level best as you expect to deal with the

8        tab issue.

9             THE COURT:  Yes.

10             MR. MOLONY:  And where we are, I'm happy

11        to report, is that we're not going to object to

12        the tabs that are affixed to that exhibit and

13        will allow it to go ahead and be admitted.

14        I've shared that with Mr. Paige in turn, the

15        expectation is that we'll be able to tab the

16        ones that we've put in and use our distributors

17        and share those with him and if he has any

18        strong feelings about any of those we'll take

19        them up with the court at the time.

20             The only other thing that we are

21        discussing right now is, I indicated to him

22        that I'm told that we don't believe that that

23        is a complete set of the total universe of

24        medical records.  And so only from the

25        standpoint at least right now, is if we were

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=181
3934

1        having, you know, we would object to it being

2        characterized as a complete set.  You know, but

3        we really don't think that that should be an

4        issue.

5             THE COURT:  It's not going to be

6        characterized to the jury as anything probably

7        until you get to closing.

8             MR. MOLONY:  Correct.

9             THE COURT:  And I would assume, I trust by

10        then we will know what it is and characterize

11        it accordingly, is that � is that it?

12             MR. MOLONY:  Yes, sir.

13             THE COURT:  Mr. Paige that works for you?

14             MR. PAIGE:  Yeah.  We hope that they will

15        let us know � you'll let us know if there are

16        records missing so we can fix it.

17             THE COURT:  You know, that doesn't have to

18        be characterized as something nefarious, it

19        could be as a matter of fact there are some

20        things not in there and so we are adding the

21        missing stuff as Exhibit X, Y, Z.

22             MR. PAIGE:  But I don't think � yeah.  I

23        don't think it will be an issue in closing 2 4                  argument anyways.

2 5                                  THE COURT:  Okay.  Just from my

understanding, Mr. Molony, if I'm understanding you right, you didn't change anything from � you haven't �

MR. MOLONY:  No, sir.

THE COURT:  � renamed any tabs?

MR. WARE:  We removed some but we didn't change any.

THE COURT:  You did take some out?

MR. PAIGE:  There were no records or something?

Yeah.  Okay.  Gotcha. Other than the ones you removed yesterday.

THE COURT: Okay. So it has been modified from yesterday slightly but the tabs per se are not objected to and you have this understanding regarding that the Defense will also be tabbing theirs.

MR. MOLONY:  Yes.  Yes, sir.  And then we will address the characterization before closing and hopefully can come to a mutual understanding as to what's in proper discretion.

THE COURT:  As far as?

MR. MOLONY:  As far as what this

10             And with that, shall we bring in the jury?

11              (Jurors entered the courtroom.)

12             COURT DEPUTY:  The jury is in the box and

13        seated, Your Honor.

14             THE COURT:  Thank you.  Welcome back

15        ladies and Mr. Cauler.  Hope you had a pleasant

16        lunch and we'll now take up where we left off

17        with Mr. Paige and Mr. Chirieac.  Mr. Paige.

2 0                  Q.   Doctor, good afternoon.  Ready?

21                            Moving to another topic, one of the things

2 2       we talked about, and I'm going to get to the

2 3       bronchoscopies and the biopsies in a moment, but I

2 4       want to talk about the chest x-rays and the CT scan,

2 5       if we can put that on the board.

2
	pneumonia
	Remember we talked about pneumonia?

3
	A.
	Yes.

4
	Q.
	And you would agree there's nowhere in the

5
	medical records that he has some of the common
	
6
	symptoms of pneumonia like cough or fever or shaking
	
7
	or chills
	, it's not anywhere in the medical records,

8
	correct?
	

9
	A.
	Yes.

10
	Q.
	Right?

11
	A.
	Yes.  That's right.

12
	Q.
	And when the chest x-ray was performed,

13
	the x-ray
	report, there's no, you know, an x-ray is

14
	something
	a doctor will do, if they suspect

15
	pneumonia
	they will take a chest x-ray, right?  You

16
	learned that, didn't you?
	
17
	A.
	Yes.

18
	Q.
	And the chest x-ray report that he wanted,

19
	there's no mention that the doctors thought it was
	
20
	pneumonia
	, correct?

21
	A.
	Correct.

22
	Q.
	And you learned though �

23
	A.
	Excuse me, may I make an addition to this?

Q.   Okay.  Which, the x-rays?

A.   One of the reports, yes.  It says like a pneumonic process.

Q.   Okay.

A.   Which is the pathology report that says inflammation of pneumonic process.

Q.   Right.  I'm going to get to the pathology But I'm asking you respectfully, Doctor, you know that a primary care doctor, I go to a primary care doctor and the doctor says hey you got a fever, you have chills, let's see if you have pneumonia.  One of the first things they will do is take a chest x-ray, right?  You know that, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   And in the chest x-ray report there's no mention of pneumonia, correct?

A.   Right.  Correct.

Q.   And no doctor ever diagnosed this gentleman with pneumonia, right?

A.
	He says a mass, yes.

Q.
	Pardon me?

A.
	A mass.

Q.
	Mass.

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Exactly.  That's quite different than

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=186
3939

1   pneumonia?

2        A.   No, it's not.  The radiology sign could be

3   a mass, so it's opacity.

4        Q.   So you think when the � when the doctor

5   put five � when the doctor put fairly large mass in

6   the right upper lobe 6.7 � 6 centimeters in

7   diameter should be considered malignant, you think

8   he thought it was pneumonia, right?

9        A.   I thought one of the differential

10   diagnosis pneumonia, right.

11        Q.   Okay.  All right.  So if I read that

12   correctly, and I'm not a doctor, so when a doctor

13   writes 6-centimeter in diameter, the mass should be

14   considered malignant, what that really means to a

15   doctor is that could be pneumonia?

16        A.   Right.

17        Q.   Okay.  I did not know that.

18             And you learned though doctor when films

19   show multiple spots in the lung, that's more

2 0       suggestive with a cancer that has metastasized to

21   the lung.  You learned that, right?

22        A.   Yes.

2 3        Q.   Okay.  And in this case it's described as

2 4       a large mass, correct? 2 5        A.   Right.

2   the CT scan there's a drawing there and there's a

3   medical record that says a tennis ball mass, right?

4        A.   Right.

5        Q.   Large tennis ball size mass in the right

6   upper lobe.

7             And what was described in the x-ray was

8   considered to be a single solid mass, correct?

9        A.   Correct.

10        Q.   And you learned, Doctor, when somebody

11   presents with a single solid mass in the lung that

12   is more suggestive of a primary lung cancer, you

13   know that, don't you?

14        A

15        Q

16        A

17   saying

18        Q

That's incorrect your statement. You did not know that?

I know that it's incorrect what you're

Okay.  Let me see if we can do this again.

19       If you look at your deposition on page 108, line one

2 0       through four and I apologize Doctor for having to

21   keep doing this.

22        A.   Right.

2 3        Q.   But anyway.  It says that I asked you the

2 4       question when you were under oath before.

2 5                             "Question:  Have you ever learned that a

3941

1        single solid mass in the lungs is more

2        consistent with a lung primary?

3             And your answer was:

4             It's more suggestive, yes."

5             Is that correct?

6        A.   So it's more suggestive but not

7   consistent.

8        Q.   All right.  So that's � so multiple

9   spots � multiple spots suggest metastasis, right?

10        A.   Right.

11        Q.   And a single solid mass suggests lung

12   primary, right?

13        A.   It's incorrect.  Actually every day, as I

14   mentioned in the morning, the most common mass in

15   the lung is a metastasis and not a primary.

16        Q.   Okay.  And just because you said that

17   the � that the bronchoscopy or the pathology at �

18   one point you said it could have been from tissue

19   from pneumonia induced by tumor; did I say that 2 0       correctly?

21        A.   Correct.

2 2        Q.   Okay.  And just because the biopsy is

2 3       negative for a tumor, you can't rule out a lung

2 4       primary?

25        A.   You cannot, yes.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=189
3942

1        Q.   And a bronchoscopy could be negative for a

2   tumor and still be a primary lung cancer, you know

3   that?

4        A.   It's not � it's not documented.

5        Q.I didn't understand that.  You learned

6   that a bronchoscopy � look, medicine is an art it's

7   not a science, right?

8        A.   I disagree with you.

9        Q.   Okay.  It's a science not an art, okay.

10   I'm wrong.  But a bronchoscopy can be negative, you

11   learned that and you can still have lung primary,

12   you know that, don't you?

13        A.   It could be.

14        Q.   Okay.  And so � and you learned that with

15   Stage IV primary lung cancer that could metastasize

16   anywhere in the body including the groin area,

17   correct?

18        A.   No.  It's not.

19        Q.   Okay.  If you could go to your deposition. 2 0       Do you have it?

21        A.   Please. 2 2        Q.   Okay.

23        A.   What I said in my deposition, I said

24   any � the lung cancer could metastasize to any

25   site, however it's not a typical site of metastasis.

8
	A.   Yes, I did.

9
	Q.   Okay.  And so we asked you this question:

10

11
	where the doctors are concerned that it could

12
	be a lung cancer, that a pulmonologist �

20
	metastasize anywhere, nothing is standard or

	cancer can metastasize to the grain area?

	"Answer:  Lung cancer can metastasize

24
	anywhere.

1        metastasize to the groin, can't it?

2             "Answer:  Stage IV means that metastatic

3        cancer, it's the same thing.

4             "Question:  The Stage IV metastatic lung

5        cancer, this is the same thing, right?

6             You answered � same question:

7             "Stage IV" � this is my question:

8             "Question:  Stage IV lung cancer can

9        spread to the groin area, can it not?

10             "Answer:  Right.  Can spread anywhere."

11             Do you remember when you gave those

12        answers under oath, Doctor?

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   Okay.  And so you � you � you had cases

15   where treating doctors thought it was lung cancer, a

16   bronchoscopy was performed and was negative, and

17   they had to get a pathology from lymph nodes

18   somewhere else in the body, you've seen that happen,

19   haven't you?

20        A.   More or less, yes.

21        Q.   Okay.  And in this case where the doctors

2 2       were concerned with lung cancer, you would recommend

2 3       that they took a biopsy from the left inguinal node

2 4       as they did, right? 25        A.   I would do that, too.

3946

1        Q.   And in this case, that's what they did,

2   right?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   And you said it was important for the

5   pathologists to work closely with the clinicians to

6   communicate with them, right?

7        A.   Agreed.

8        Q.   So we know Dr. Iyer, he did a biopsy �

9   he's a surgeon, right?

10        A.   Right.

11        Q.   And he did the biopsy of the left inguinal

12   lymph node, right?

13        A.   Right.

14        Q.   And when you gave your deposition, again

15   when you gave your deposition, you understood this

16   was a matter that was important for the parties,

17   right?

18        A.   It's important for the patient first and

19   foremost.

2 0        Q.   For the family, right?

21        A.   For the patient first.  I mean it's the

22   person who is dying who wants to be treated.

23   Remember at the time of the biopsy the patient

24   didn't start the treatment.  I agree with you it's

25   very important.

1        Q.   Okay.  I apologize.  I don't think that's

2   clear.  I just meant when you sat down for your

3   deposition and I was taking your deposition?

4        A.   Yes.

5        Q.   And you knew it was important testimony

6   that were you giving that day, didn't you?

7        A.   Right.  I was asked to give my expert

8   opinion on this matter.

9        Q.   And so before you gave your deposition, it

10   was important for you to review all the important

11   medical records, right?

12        A.   All the medical records.

13        Q.   And it was important for you to review all

14   the available important depositions, right?

15        A.   Right.

16        Q.   And you didn't do that, did you?

17        A.   I did not.

18        Q.   And so when you gave your opinions and you

19   said these are my final opinions, I'm testifying 2 0       under oath, and you gave your final opinions, you

21   hadn't even reviewed everything, did you?

22        A.   I did not review some of the depositions

23   but I reviewed all the clinical � the medical

24   records.

1   the medical records, did you?

2        A.   I did.  I think it's � I think you're

3   confused.

4        Q.   Okay.

5        A.   I had all the medical records.  And you

6   asked me in the deposition and I said, yes, I

7   reviewed all the clinical records.  What I did not

8   and it was a mistake on my part and a missing on my

9   part, I did not review some of the depositions.  And

10   I remembered that I told you in my deposition at the

11   time of the deposition that I do not base my

12   scientific expert opinion on deposition.

13        Q.   Okay.  Doctor, this is Dr. Iyer's

14   operative report and handwritten notes, correct?

15        A.   I trust you.  I don't know it's correct or

12        Q.   Right.  And then Dr. Iyer from the � on

13   the progress note on 9/18/92, you have that in tab

14   12 where it says large cell carcinoma consistent

15   with lung primary; do you see that?

16        A.   You're saying the frozen section report?

17   Yes, I see that.

18        Q.   So when Dr. Iyer wrote left groin lymph

19   node incision biopsy performed, large cell carcinoma 2 0       consistent with lung primary, and when you gave your 21       deposition you agreed that you did not know that

2 2       Dr. Iyer had written a record that he thought it is

2 3       was lung primary, correct?

24 A. This is inaccurate what you said, correct. 2 5        Q.   No, that again, that wasn't my question

1   and I apologize.  It's probably � I may be speaking

2   too fast.

3             When you gave your deposition?

4        A.   Okay.

5        Q.   You were unaware of the fact that Dr. Iyer

6   wrote in his records that this patient had a lung

7   primary, you didn't know that, did you, back then?

8        A.   I don't know.  Let's review the

9   deposition.  I'm not familiar with what you're

10   saying.

11        Q.   You think this would be important to know

12   before you give sworn testimony whether the doctors

13   who are treating him �

14        A.   Everything is important, everything.

15        Q.   Doctors are obviously � obviously he's

16   communicating with the pathologist, correct?

17        A.   Obviously he is not correct because the

18   communication is not correct.

19        Q.   Doctor, I'm just asking you a question, a 2 0       simple question.  Obviously he's communicating with

21   the pathologist, correct?

22        A.   Obviously he is incorrect.

2 3        Q.   Answer my first question then I promise

2 4       I'll ask you if he is correct or not, okay? 2 5        A.   Right.

	Q.   My point is, the pathology report �

24
	A.   Yes.

1             The pathology report was not finalized

2   with the special staining and all this stuff about

3   the adenocarcinoma and the mucin, that wasn't until

4   9/22, right?

5        A.   So �

6             THE WITNESS:  Your Honor, can I answer

7        this question?  There are like two questions

8        here, so � there are two questions.  One is

9        finalized and one is typed.  So there are two

10        thinqs.  In patholoqy we have a preliminary

11        report, which is frozen section, which is the

12        surqery.

13             THE COURT:  Okay.  You can qo ahead and

14        tell him.

16        Q.   Tell me because I don't know.

17        A.   Riqht.  So you're askinq two questions.

18        Q.   Okay.

19        A.   The report was not typed.  It is not true.

20   The report is typed at the time of frozen section at

21   the time of surqery.

2 2                  Q.   Which was when?

23                  A.   Which is the frozen section diaqnosis.

2 4                  Q.   Which was when?

25                  A.   Which is the 9/18.

1
	Q.
	Okay.

2
	A.
	So was frozen section � the final report,

3
	what you
	think is four days later, because they have

4
	different
	sections.  So it's � you ask me two

5
	questions
	to tell me to answer to you correct or

6
	not.  And
	it's not accurate what you're askinq me.

7
	Q.
	Okay.  I didn't understand that.

8
	A.
	Okay.

9
	Q.
	Okay.  Again, so the frozen section report

10
	was done
	by the pathologist, correct?

11
	A.
	Yes.

12
	Q.
	And that was revealed to the surgeon that

13
	it's metastatic to the lymph node with lung primary,
	
14
	correct?
	

15
	A.
	No, it's not.

16
	Q.
	But that's what surgeon wrote, right?

17
	A.
	Yeah, this is what the surgeon wrote, but

18
	this is n
	ot correct what he heard from the

19
	patholoqist is what I'm sayinq.
	
20
	Q.
	And when you gave your deposition, and

21
	then Dr.
	Iyer wrote in his notes, "large cell

22
	carcinoma
	consistent with lung primary," you see

23
	that?
	

24
	A.
	Yes.

25
	Q.
	And my only question was, when you gave

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=203
3956

1   your deposition, you were unaware of that note from

2   Dr. Iyer?  That's all I'm asking you.

3        A.   It might be, I don't know.

4        Q.   Okay.  So you were � that's all.  I was

5   just trying to get to the point that maybe you were

6   a little unprepared in reviewing the records in the

7   deposition.

8             MR. WARE:  Objection to the

9        characterization.

10             THE COURT:  Sustained.

11     BY MR. PAIGE

12        Q.   And then the fact that Dr. Iyer found that

13   this was lung primary, you would agree that is an

14   important fact in this case, correct?

15        A.   It's important to know the specific

16   diagnosis.

17        Q.   Okay.  He was a doctor, he was there

18   talking to the pathologist, you were not, correct?

19        A.   Yes.

2 0                  Q.   Okay.  And � okay.

21                            And we know Dr. Rao is an oncologist,

2 2        correct?

23                  A.   Correct.

2 4                  Q.   An oncologist is a doctor that spends

2 5       their professional lives dealing with patients who

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=204
3957

1
	lung cancer, correct?
	
2
	A.
	Correct.

3
	Q.
	And you're not trained in oncology, nor do

4
	you hold
	yourself out as an oncologist, that's not

5
	what you
	do, right ?

6
	A.
	Right.

7
	Q.
	And if we could see Dr. Rao's records.

8
	
	This is Dr. Rao from 9/18/92.

9
	
	And when you reviewed the records, you saw

10
	where Dr.
	Rao wrote "large cell cancer" � by the

11
	way, large cell � when you talk about large cell �
	
12
	A.
	Yes.

13
	Q.
	� large cell is generally lung cancer,

14
	right?
	

15
	A.
	No, it's not.

16
	Q.
	Okay.  So when a doctor says "large

17
	cell" �
	

18
	A.
	Yes.

19
	Q.
	� 99 percent, a large percentage of large

20
	cells are
	i  lung cancer, right?

21
	A.
	No, it's not.

22
	Q.
	Okay.  Well, maybe I don't know that.

23
	What is that?
	
24
	A.
	Large cell carcinoma is a category, a

25
	broad cat
	.egory of cancer to distinguish them from

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=205
3958

1   small cell carcinoma.

2             So at the time of Mr. Duignan's diagnosis

3   in the 1990s, there are only two major treatment

4   categories for cancers.  The most important is to

5   exclude the small cell carcinoma.  Small cell

6   carcinoma is treated in a completely different way

7   than other cancers.

8             So in order for an oncologist to hear

9   that, they need to hear only two faces of the coin.

10   Either it's small cell or a nonsmall cell, or a

11   large cell.  So that's why a lot of the pathologists

12   hearing small cell carcinoma, in that case, you're

13   not allowed to do surgery, you're not allowed to do

14   any other treatment but to start immediately with a

15   small cell carcinoma treatment with chemotherapy.

16             All the other categories are lumped in

17   this bag, if you want, in the basket that are called

18   large cell carcinoma.  Nonsmall cell carcinoma is

19   one of those terms that we highly discourage at this

20   present time in the classifications.

21        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

2 2                             And so we have Dr. Parikh's record on

23       9/19.  He was a neurologist who was also involved. 2 4                             And Dr. Parikh, again, he was talking to

2 5       the doctors, and he was involved and he was writing,

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=206
3959

1   and he probably has cancer of the lung with a mass

2   to the brain, right?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   Okay.  And generally as a pathologist, you

5   don't consider the metastatic pattern of cancer in

6   determining the primary site, that's not the role

7   that you play, correct?

8        A.   Could you repeat the question?

9        Q.   As a pathologist, and again, I'm not being

10   critical, everybody has their role, right?

11        A.   Yes.  Yes.  Obviously.

12        Q.   You're not a clinician, we talked about

13   that.

14             So you � you have � do you have like

15   a � where you look at the slides, is it like a

16   laboratory or is it an office?  Where do you do

17   that?

18        A.   No, it's a larger area.  We look at �

19   multiple residents, some of my trainees � and we

20   look under the microscope.  It's called a

21   multiheaded scope.

2 2        Q.   So when you look at the multiheaded scope

2 3       as a pathologist to determine the primary site, I

2 4       know we talked about the special staining they have

2 5       today, correct?

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=207
3960

1
	A.   Yes.

2
	Q.   But you as a pathologist, you don't

3
	consider the metastatic pattern when you determine

4
	the primary site of the cancer, correct?

5
	A.   No, we don't.

6
	Q.   Okay.  The clinicians do that, correct?

7
	A.   All of us.  I mean, I know that, you know,

8
	the patterns of spread, it's what I'm doing.  But

9
	obviously, I'm looking at the microscope for a

10
	diagnosis.

11
	Q.   Okay.  And if it's primary lung cancer, we

12
	know the first place it generally goes is in the

13
	hilar or the mediastinal lymph node, correct?

14
	A.   The first is hilar.  It could go to

15
	mediastinum or it could go to the brain first.

16
	Q.   So one of the first places that the cancer

17
	will go � he had large lymph nodes, correct?

18
	A.   Yes.

19
	Q.   In the hilar region, correct?

20
	A.   Correct.

21
	Q.   And so we know that he is a gentleman who

22
	has this tennis-ball size mass with lymph nodes in

23
	the hilar lymph nodes, and we know from lung cancer

24
	that's the first place that lung cancer

25
	metastasizes?

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=208
3961

1        A.   It could go, yes.

2        Q.   And by the way, colon cancer, we know that

3   about 70 percent of colon cancers metastasize to the

4   liver, you know that, don't you?

5        A.   No, actually, it's not true.  Colon cancer

6   goes first to the � it's called local regional with

7   mesenteric lymph nodes.

8        Q.   Sir, listen.  Let me ask you first.  I

9   asked you, do you know that when colon cancer

10   metastasizes, do you not know that about 60 to

11   70 percent of them will go to the liver?

12        A.   I know, and it's lymph nodes.  So I did

13   the research in cancer, so I do know that the first

14   is not liver, it's called regional mesenteric lymph

15   nodes.  One is stage II cancer, the other one is

16   stage III cancer.

17        Q.   Sir, again, maybe we are � I'm saying one

18   thing and you're saying something else.

19             Have you learned that with liver cancer � 2 0       with liver cancer, in the first place, liver cancer 21       we generally know with the metastatic pattern, 60 to 2 2       70 percent of the time will involve the liver; did

2 3       you know that or �

24        A.   No, it's not accurate.

25             MR. WARE:  It's not colon cancer?

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=210
3963

1   you don't dispute that stage IV lung cancer can

2   metastasize to that area, correct?

3        A.   Stage IV means distant metastases.  So

4   it's by definition metastatic.

5        Q.   Doctor, respectfully, can stage IV

6   metastatic lung cancer metastasize to the mesentery?

7        A.   It's not a medical term, so I don't know

8   how to answer.  I think it's confusing the terms.

9             THE WITNESS:  Can I make him clarify to

10        the jury because I'm not sure what he wants to

11        know.

12             THE COURT:  Well, can you answer it in lay

13        terms?

14             THE WITNESS:  In lay terms, what I want to

15        say, that when a patient comes to the doctor's,

16        he or she is staged.  So staging and stage IV

17        means that already the patient is metastatic.

18        So you cannot say a stage IV metastasizes to

19        distance.  It's already metastatic.

20             THE COURT:  Mr. Paige, did you get that?

21             THE WITNESS:  It's already metastatic.  In

22        other words, if a cancer metastasizes to

23        distant place, it's already a stage IV. 2 4            BY MR. PAIGE

2 5                  Q.   So that's what I want to know.  If

13
	Q.
	And have you learned that most cases of

	liver metastasis develop from colon or rectal
	
15
	cancer, in fact, approximately 60 to 70 percent of
	
16

3   ever mentioned in this case was when you gave your

4   deposition, right?

5        A.   Yes.

6        Q.   And that was � and considering all the

7   other doctors in this case, you know, the fact that

8   he had a large tennis-ball-size mass in his lung

9   that went to the hilar lymph nodes, went to the bone

10   and brain, didn't go to the liver, smoked a

11   45-pack-year history, most of the doctors said it

12   was lung cancer, you would agree that your opinion,

13   in all honestly, is a pretty extreme opinion?

14        A.   I think it's the correct opinion.

15        Q.   Okay.  You're right and everybody else is

16   wrong?

17        A.   I think everybody's wrong because all the

18   physicians you mentioned, they are positive about

19   this case as I am, two pathologists are saying this

20   is a carcinoma of unknown primary, and then if you

21   look about the appearance � you want to talk about

22   the appearance of distant spread, it's so uncommon

23   for the lung cancer to gone to the inguinal nodes.

24   And the most common cause of the large lymph nodes

25   in the groin, it's colorectal cancer.

1             So you don't want to explain that.  I do

2   like to have an explanation for that.  I do like to

3   have an explanation for mesenteric involvement in

4   the mesentery, in the inside of the belly.  I would

5   like also to have an explanation about the blood per

6   rectum.

7             There are things that, you know, when you

8   get into the consideration, you cannot explain

9   everything by putting everything � it's a very

10   simplistic course of duration that you do.  And I

11   don't think it's the right answer, and the science

12   behind this is not supported.  I'm sorry.

13        Q.   I'm not looking to argue with you, okay?

14        A.   Yeah.

15        Q.   You understand you're here as � not to be

16   an advocate, but to just answer my questions, right?

17        A.   I'm an expert in the lung cancer and the

18   pathology of lung cancer.  That's the main reason

19   I'm here.

2 0        Q.   Exactly.  And I have no problems with your

21       qualifications, and I see you've done some good

2 2       things, and I know you're being paid money to be

2 3       here today.  But your opinion, when you consider all

2 4       the other doctors, that metastatic lung cancer is

2 5       usually multiple spots, and guy had got a single

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408

1   spot, would you consider that � you know, in fact,

2   classic lung cancer metastasizes to the brain,

3   correct?

4             MR. WARE:  Objection.  Is there a question

5        here?

6     BY MR. PAIGE

7        Q.   Okay.  Let me ask you this.

8             Classic lung cancer will metastasize to

9   the brain, right?

10        A.   Right.

11        Q.   And the CT scan showed that he had brain

12   metastasis, right?

13        A.   Correct.

14        Q.   And lung cancer will also spread to the

15   bones, right?

16        A.   Correct.

17        Q.   And the bone scans shown that he had two

18   bone metastases, correct?

19        A.   Correct.

2 0                  Q.   And Dr. Rao, you can see his note on 9/20,

21       he was a doctor who was there who was treating him,

2 2        right?

2 3                      A.   Right.

2 4                  Q.   He was doing the best for the family at

2 5       the time when they didn't have the staining that we

	have 25 years later, right?
	
2
	A
	Right.

3
	Q
	And he writes, "Possible lung primary with

4
	metastasis is most probable."
	
5
	
	Did I read that correctly?

6
	A
	Correct.  He is puzzled by the pattern

7
	stain.
	

8
	
	And I would like to clarify, too,

9
	something.  A lot of cancers go to brain.  Breast
	
10
	cancers can go to brain, breast cancer go to the
	
11
	bones -
	�

12
	Q
	He didn't have � sir, he didn't have

13
	breast
	cancer, right?

14
	A
	No, but I'm telling you, to clarify �

15
	Q
	Sir.  Sir.  Relax.

16
	
	He didn't have breast cancer, right?

17
	Right?
	

18
	A
	He did not have ---yes.

19
	Q
	He didn't have prostate cancer, right?

20
	A
	How do you know?

21
	Q
	Well, you told me he didn't have prostate

22
	cancer
	

23
	A
	Okay.  He didn't have �

24
	Q
	Okay.  So that's how know, you told me

25
	that, i

1        A.   Okay.

2        Q.   Doctor, why would you tell me something in

3   your deposition and tell me something else here

4   today?  Why would you do that?

5             MR. WARE:  Objection, Your Honor.

6             THE COURT:  Sustained.

7     BY MR. PAIGE

8        Q.   Do you now think he had prostate cancer?

9             THE WITNESS:  So should I answer or no?

10             THE COURT:  Yes.  That's a new question.

11        You can answer that question.

12             THE WITNESS:  Okay.  So can you repeat the

13        question?

14     BY MR. PAIGE

15        Q.   Are you now going to change your opinion

16   and start saying that �

17        A.   No, I'm not changing my opinion.

18        Q.   � he had breast cancer or prostate

19   cancer?

2 0                   A.   No.

21                  Q.   Now, in this note, Dr. Rao writes, "Other

2 2       etiologies include" �

23             MR. WARE:  Objection.  Again, I object to

24        covering up 80 percent of the document and

25        pulling out a couple of lines unless the doctor

For the record, if you're � I think you understand, if you're going ask him about the excerpt, make sure he has the entire document in hand. BY MR. PAIGE

MR. PHILIPSON:  49.3. BY MR. PAIGE Q.   Okay.

A.   Yeah, but I think it's missing a page here.  This is page 1, so I'd like to have the entire document if you don't mind.

1             MR. PAIGE:  Your Honor, I was just trying

2        to shortcut it and do this.  But if you want,

3        we can take a little break and print them all

4        out for him.

5             MR. WARE:  Well, I think he's probably got

6        them in front of him, but we can't tell from

7        these two lines what piece of paper.

8             MR. PHILIPSON:  49.380 is the Bates

10             THE COURT:  But can you correlate to the

11        set of documents that the doctor is holding?

12             MR. PHILIPSON:  In their tab numbers?

13             THE COURT:  Yes.

14             Would you all like to take a break while

15        they sort this out?

16             The majority of the jury would like to

pgNbr=221
3974

1        Q.   He also gave you a hard copy of the

2   document.  You have that, right?

3        A.   Yes.

4        Q.   So I want to show a part of it so we can

5   focus in on that, okay?

6        A.   Yeah.

7        Q.   And so on this document from Dr. Rao, he's

8   the oncologist who is trained in cancer, right?

9        A.   Right.

10        Q.   He is the one making his official medical

11   record, possible lung primary with metastasis is the

12   most probable, right?

13        A.   Right.

14        Q.   But he's not writing, he is not

15   100 percent certain, right, he is uncertain and he

16   writes, other etiologies include large cell

17   lymphoma, extragonadal germ cell tumor with wide

18   spread disease, right?

19        A.   Right.

2 0        Q.   So at that point, although Dr. Rao,

21       looking at the whole clinical picture with the

2 2       tennis ball and the hilar lymph nodes and the brain

2 3       and bone metastasis and the smoking history, he says

2 4       hey, I think we got a probably lung cancer but we

2 5       can't be certain, we are uncertain and let's look at

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=222
3975

1   these other discusses, right?

2        A.   That is not right.  It is not right

3   because this is before he was diagnosed with brain

4   so this is the document you're showing, it's early

5   in the disease.  So before the biopsy.  So I think

6   you're combining the late stage of the patient with

7   the early.  So this is early in the assessment.

8        Q.   Okay.

9        A.   This is the time before he had the �

10        Q.   CT scan?

11        A.   The scan � no, before he had the biopsy.

12        Q.   The biopsy?

13        A.   So lymphoma is in the diagnosis, the

14   extragonadal it is and then it says even later on

15   it's one thing that you said that basically his

16   overall prognosis of course will depend upon the

17   type of malignancy that is eventually confirmed.

18        Q.   That's what I'm trying to get to?

19        A.   So what I'm saying is that this � 2 0        Q.   Doctor, I'm not disagreeing.

21             THE WITNESS:  May I finish what I'm

22        saying?

23             THE COURT:  I want to explain.  When he

24        says right, he asks a question that ends with

25        right, he doesn't mean is the content of what

1        he is referring to do you agree with it, he is

2        asking is the statement he just made accurate.

3        And when he makes a statement like so and so

4        said something, right, he is just asking was

5        that statement made, is that � have I got that

6        right?  Right, Mr. Paige?

7             THE WITNESS:  What you're asking?

8             MR. PAIGE:  Partly.  See.

9             THE WITNESS:  See.  But it is not

10        accurate.  You are asking me if it is not

11        accurate what he is saying.  Part is accurate.

12        Part is not.  So that's why I'm trying to

13        explain, what's accurate and what is not.  He

14        says that --

15             MR. PAIGE:  Doctor?

16             THE WITNESS:  � the patient has early

17        metastasis, we don't know that.

18     BY MR. PAIGE

19        Q.   Doctor, doctor.  I hear you.  Listen.  Let 2 0       me � I threw something in that probably I spoke too 21       fast.  The CT scan of the chest with the hilar lymph 2 2       nodes was not even done yet.  That was done on 9/22, 2 3        right?

24                  A.   Exactly.

1        A.   Right.

2        Q.   Okay.  But at this point, Dr. Rao, who is

3   the cancer doctor, oncologist, he knows about a

4   large tennis-ball-size mass, right?

5        A.   Right.

6        Q.   In a guy with a significant smoking

7   history, right?

8        A.   Correct.

9        Q.   And he is writing in the medical record �

10   I think this guy probably has lung cancer, right?

11        A.   The three etiologies are lung, lymphoma

12   and germ cell, correct.

13        Q.   I'm going to get to those too.  He is

14   saying hey, I think it's possibly lung cancer, but

15   there's also, I can't be certain, I'm uncertain

16   because it could be possible lymphoma and possible

17   germ cell, right?

18        A.   Right.  Correct.

19        Q.   Okay.  So we are on the same page.

2 0                             And so when Dr. Rao initially considered

21       lymphoma, that was a different treatable disease for

2 2       this gentleman, correct?

23        A.   Correct.

2 4        Q.   And because of the concerns of lymphoma,

2 5       certain staining was done by the pathologist either

1   to rule that in or rule that out, right?

2        A.   Mild lymphoma?  He didn't talk about mild

3   lymphoma.

4        Q.   Because of concerns of lymphoma, certain

5   staining was done by the pathologist either to rule

6   in lymphoma or rule it out, correct?

7        A.   Correct.

8        Q.   Okay.  And Dr. Rao was also concerned that

9   it could possibly be germ cell, right?

10        A.   Correct.

11        Q.   Didn't say probable, the only thing he is

12   saying that's probable is lung cancer.  He is also

13   saying possible germ cell, right?

14        A.   Right.

15        Q.   And because of concerns of germ cell,

16   staining was done by the pathologist to rule that in

17   or rule that out, right?

18        A.   Correct.

19        Q.   And the first path report is 9/22 or what 2 0       I want to show you a 9/22 report by Dr. Herbert.

21   You've seen this, correct?

22        A.   Yes.  It is not the first one though.  The

23   9/18 we talked about it.

	Q.   That rules out germ cell, not a hundred

7
	percent because they still had to do another

8
	staining of the hCG but at that time it did not look

9
	like germ cell, right?

10
	A.   Correct.

11
	Q.   Okay.  Mucin, keratin and CAE were

12
	positive, right?

13
	A.   Correct.

14
	Q.   And at that time they said, hey, look at

15
	it under the microscope, if it was a lymphoma or a

16
	germ cell they could probably see that with the

17
	staining, right?

18
	A.   With the staining, yes.

19
	Q.   Okay.  So that time the doctor said

20
	adenocarcinoma, right?

21
	A.   Correct.

22
	Q.   And the pathologist ruled out � that was

23
	ruled out any concern of the possibility or the

24
	uncertainty of lymphoma at that time?

25
	A.   Correct.

1
	Q.
	Okay.  And the hCG is still in progress

2
	and they
	say a supplemental report will follow,

3
	right?
	

4
	A.
	Correct.

5
	Q.
	And then on 10/2/92, let me show that

6
	report.
	The frozen sections were done or special

7
	stains for hCG were determined to be negative,
	
8
	right?
	

9
	A.
	Correct.

10
	Q.
	And so at that time, the germ cell was

11
	ruled out
	completely by the pathologist, correct?

12
	A.
	Correct.

13
	Q.
	So you have this gentleman where they were

14
	hoping he
	had a lymphoma, or a germ cell because

15
	they could treat it, they said hey that's possible,
	
16
	and those
	were ruled out, correct?

17
	A.
	Correct.

18
	Q.
	And you agree with the finding of adeno,

19
	right?
	

20
	A.
	Correct.

21
	Q.
	And as a medical expert, you keep up with

22
	the medical literature on adenocarcinoma, don't you?
	
23
	A.
	Of course.

24
	Q.
	And in keeping up with the medical

25
	literatures as an expert, you learned that there has

2             MR. WARE:  Objection.

3             THE COURT:  Want to approach?

4             MR. WARE:  Yes.

5              (Sidebar discussion held:)

6             THE COURT:  Where are you going?

7             MR. PAIGE:  He says as a medical expert he

8        keeps up with the medical literature.

9             THE COURT:  I got that.

10             MR. PAIGE:  And he has learned that

11        there's an increase in adenocarcinoma �

12             THE COURT:  I got that.

13             MR. PAIGE:  � as a result of smoking

14        patterns from filters.

15             THE COURT:  So?

16             MR. WARE:  He has not been proffered as an

17        expert on filters or increases in cancers as a

18        result of smoking.  I mean, this again goes

19        well beyond.

20             MR. MICHAEL:  This is the motion that we

21        filed.  He has a copy somewhere.

22             MR. MICHAEL:  We actually filed a motion

23        on this as to both Dr. Burns and Dr. Chirieac.

2 4                             THE COURT:  I don't even know that we need

25                  to get to that, it's beyond the scope of direct

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=229
3982

1        anyway.  The direct had to do with his opinion,

2        you know, if he learned something since then

3        that � you're already making distinctions and

4        rightfully between the state of the art now and

5        the state of the art then.  If the state of the

6        art now include some findings that would change

7        things, that would � that might be irrelevant

8        anyway but this isn't even related to the issue

9        of diagnosis.  So I don't see it.

10             MR. PAIGE:  People who smoke with filters

11        because of the filters there's a rise in

12        adenocarcinoma.

13             THE COURT

14             MR. PAIGE

15             THE COURT

I know.  I know.

� rise in adenocarcinoma.

I know that's part of your

16        theory in your case.  You present some other

17        evidence that will support that.

18             MR. PAIGE:  Pardon me?

19             THE COURT:  You presented some other

20        evidence that would support that.

21             MR. PAIGE:  I don't think so.

22             THE COURT:  Well, I think if people smoke

23        more because of filters or get more nicotine

24        because of filters.

25             MR. PAIGE:  But the cell type.  The point

3983

1        is that he was explaining the different cell

2        types, large cell, small cell.

3             THE COURT:  But there's still � this does

4        not � he doesn't have � except what you

5        elicited about the smokers, about the

6        decedent's smoking behavior relative to the

7        diagnosis.  And you're trying � the only

8        reason for you to do this would be to try to

9        tie something between smoking and the

10        diagnosis, right?

11             MR. PAIGE:  Well �

12             THE COURT:  Actually, the diagnosis �

13        there's no dispute of it that he had

14        adenocarcinoma, right?

15             MR. PAIGE:  Exactly.  But they are trying

16        to say, well, at 42, how did he get

17        adenocarcinoma, you know, at 42, he is smoking

18        all these filter and these filters are giving

19        an increase in adenocarcinoma.

2 0                             THE COURT:  You can't get that in through

21        this witness.

22             MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  Can I ask him this and

23        I'll move on � well I have to move on, you

24        told me to move on.

25             THE COURT:  We are just all trying to do

12        Q.   Okay.  Ready, Doctor?

13        A.   Yes.

14        Q.   Adenocarcinoma is a glandular � you can

15   leave the sign on � is a glandular tumor, right?

16        A.   It's a tumor produced by cells that

17   secrete mucus, yes.

18        Q.   Okay.  And we know adenocarcinoma can only

19   be primary in certain parts of the body, right?

20        A.   Can � yes.

21        Q.   And some of the parts of the body would

2 2       include ovarian cancer, could be an adenocarcinoma,

2 3        right?

24        A.   Any, as I explained this morning, any

	Right.

	We know he did not have testicular cancer?

	A
	Correct.

12
	Q
	We know he did not have lymphoma, correct?

13
	A
	Lymphoma is not an adenocarcinoma.

14
	Q
	Regardless, he didn't have lymphoma?

15
	A
	No, he did not.

16
	Q
	Okay.  So the only other organ other than

17
	the lur
	lg that you can think of where this

18
	adenoce
	ircinoma could have possibly started other

3        A.   Yeah.  You can talk.

4        Q.   But I don't want to keep going around and

5   around and around about the things we know it's not.

6             So the only other organ in the body other

7   than the lung where you think that the

8   adenocarcinoma could have been primary from, an

9   organ that you can tell me of, is the colon, right?

10        A.   Right.

11        Q.   Okay.

12             And when you cannot determine the primary

13   site, you generally defer to the clinicians to use

14   their clinical judgment to determine what they think

15   is the most probable cause, right?

16        A.   They need to start the treatment.

17        Q.   Sir, when you � I don't know what that

18   mean.

19             When you cannot determine what the primary 2 0       site is, you generally defer to the clinicians to

21       use their clinical judgment to determine what they

2 2       think is the most probable primary site, that's what

2 3       you do in your job, right?

24        A.   Partially, right, yes.  Partially right

25   partially, no.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408

3988

1        Q.   And in this case, it was a clinical

2   judgment of the clinician to treat this man that he

3   had primary � most probable had primary lung

4   cancer, right?

5        A.   Partially right, yes.

6        Q.   Thank you.

7        Q.   I'm getting tired.

8        A.   Me too.

9        Q.   I apologize.

10        A.   That's all right.

11        Q.   So now we go to 9/22, after the special

12   staining and I want to go through what some of the

13   doctors wrote.  We have Dr. Rao, again, so far if

14   you can bring up the sign because it's handwritten

15   here.

16             So far we discussed � the case was

17   discussed with Dr. Shah who is a pulmonologist,

18   right?  Right?

19        A.   Right.

2 0       Q.   So far metastatic adenocarcinoma appears

21       to be the diagnosis.  Primary is probably the lung.

2 2       And they were waiting for the official serum tumor

2 3       markers at that time.  And we know that the tumor

2 4       serum staining for the hCG came back on 10/2, right? 25        A.   Correct.

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=236
3989

1        Q.   Then on 9/22, the same day, you know,

2   Doctor, that if the doctors believe a patient has

3   lung cancer they'll send him home with information

4   from the American Lung Association, right, you know

5   that?

6        A.   It's not right.

7        Q.   You do not know that?

8        A.   No.

9        Q.   And so � okay.

10             Doctor, if somebody goes to the hospital

11   for cancer, a doctor thinks it's breast cancer, they

12   will send the patient home with information

13   regarding breast cancer, right?

14        A.   Correct.

15        Q.   And the doctors think it's lung cancer,

16   they will give them information regarding lung

17   cancer, right?

18        A.   Correct.

19        Q.   And when you gave your sworn testimony

2 0       again under the oath and you said hey I don't know

21       what it is, it's uncertain, who knows, it could be

2 2       colon cancer, you were unaware that they had sent

2 3       him home with information from the American Lung

2 4       Association, you didn't know about that record

2 5       either, did you?

1        A.   No, I did not.

2        Q.   Okay.  Did they not give you the record or

3   did you not read all the records?

4        A.   I don't think it's significant that the

5   patient was sent with the � the fact that the

6   patient --

10   to know, Doctor, Doctor if you look at me?

11        A.   Yes.

12        Q.   I want to know if they didn't give you the

13   record, if you didn't receive it or if you received

14   it and just didn't read it?

15        A.   No, I received it and I read all the

16   records.

17        Q.   Okay.  You told me that you didn't read

18   that record?

19        A.   I � you asked me something else.  Not

20   that I read the record or not.  You asked me if I

21   know that the patients with lung cancer are sent

22   home with lung cancer and the fact that the patient

23   is sent home with a brochure, this would certify the

24   diagnosis.  So what you're asking me is that just

25   the fact that the patient received a brochure, it's

1   examination with Mr. Ware when you went over

2   Dr. Brant's 9/23 record, if we can see this, for the

3   records, put the whole record up.  The whole record.

4   That part's on there.

5             You see at the beginning where it says,

6   thank you for your referral for consideration of

7   irradiation � irradiation for widely metastatic

8   adenocarcinoma with brain metastasis, you said you

9   would expect a different description in the note if

10   the doctor thought it was primary lung cancer, do

11   you remember you said that?

12        A.   No, I don't remember.

13        Q.   Okay.  And then later in the note the

14   doctor writes "it's my impression" � this is after

15   speaking with Dr. Rao who spoke to Dr. Shah, "it's

16   my impression he has widely metastatic

17   adenocarcinoma, primarily lung primary"; do you see

18   that?  Did I read that right?

19             UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Probable.

20             MR. PAIGE:  I'm sorry?  Did I read it

21        wrong?

22             THE WITNESS:  No.  No.  I see that.

23             MR. GORDON:  Probable lung.

24             MR. PAIGE:  Okay.  So I didn't read it

2        Q.   Widely metastatic adenocarcinoma probable

3   lung primary, correct, not certain but probable,

4   more likely than not, right?

5        A.   I don't think it reads this way.  It

6   doesn't read in the �

7        Q.   Do you know what probable means?

8          A.   Yes.

9        Q.   More likely than not?

10        A.   No, it's not in the legal terms, no.

11        Q.   So probable means unlikely to you?

12        A.   The problem is that it's a degree of

13   uncertainty, and then this is what he is saying it

14    might be.

15          Q.   Right.  He is not 100 percent certain?

16        A.   Yes.  He is not certain, yes.

17        Q.   That's his opinion that's what it probably

18   is, right?

19          A.   Yes.

2 0                  Q.   Okay.  That's what a lot of doctors

21       thought it probably was, right?  Because they didn't

2 2       have the special staining 20 years ago that they

2 3       have today, right?

2 4                       A.   Right.

2 5                  Q.   And Mr. Duignan shouldn't be penalized

1   because there wasn't a special staining 20 years

2   ago, should he?

3             MR. WARE:  Objection.

4        A.   I think �

5             THE COURT:  Don't answer.  Mr. Ware has

6        objected and I'm sustaining the objection.

7     BY MR. PAIGE

8        Q.   Then if we could do to the tab 22 that you

9   were shown was the large � well, I can just talk to

10   you about it.  It's a pain management record where

11   it says "large cell carcinoma, unknown primary."  Do

12   you remember that record?

13        A.   Right.  Yes.

14        Q.   And you agree that this type of doctor, a

15   pain management doctor, is usually not the type of

16   doctor who diagnoses cancer?

17        A.   Nobody diagnoses cancer except

18   pathologist, yes, I agree.

19        Q.   Okay.  So in this case, you see where the 2 0       pulmonologist, the oncologist who are diagnosing

21   cancer �

22        A.   Right.  They don't diagnose cancer, right. 2 3                  Q.   But I'm saying you know that an

2 4       anesthesiologist, a pain management doctor, they

2 5       certainly don't diagnose cancer?

	A.
	Like the oncologist, like the radiologist,

2
	they don'

3
	Q.
	So if I have this correctly, what you're

4
	saying is
	if somebody goes to � gets cancer �

5

	Right.

10
	A.
	He is not certified to diagnose.

11
	Q.
	� he is not supposed to do that.

12
	A.
	No.

13
	Q.
	Okay.

14
	A.
	This is malpractice.  If an oncologist who

15
	diagnosed
	lung cancer, this is severely penalized

16
	for �
	

17
	Q.
	So all the �

18
	
	THE COURT:  Wait.  Don't interrupt him,

19
	please.
	
20
	
	You can finish your statement.

21
	A.
	Yes.  So this is considered malpractice.

22
	An oncolo
	gist is not allowed, or even a surgeon is

23
	not allowed to diagnose cancer.  Because otherwise
	
24
	there will be a lot of people dying left and right.

	And Dr. Brant said he diagnosed this

	patient,
	and his impression was he had lung cancer,

5
	right?
	

6
	A.
	It's his responsibility.  Everybody has

7
	his own
	medical conscience.

8
	Q.
	Exactly.  And � right.  Everybody should

11
	A.

12
	Q.
	And that includes being truthful about

13
	what thi
	s gentleman most probably had, right?

14
	A.
	Couldn't agree with you more.

15
	Q.
	And you know, Doctor, don't you, that you

16
	partially agree with the treating doctors that your
	
17
	opinion
	is that although it's probably lung cancer,

18
	it could

	A.
	Correct.

25
	Q.
	Most unknown � if somebody goes to a

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=245
3998

1   doctor, you go to a special unit in your hospital,

2   right, and the initial diagnosis is unknown primary

3   when they get there, right?

4             And one of the first things they want to

5   do is find out if they can decide what that unknown

6   primary is, what the primary site is so they can

7   treat him for that disease, right?

8        A.   Correct.

9        Q.   So they start out as being an unknown

10   primary, they are not sure, and they have a special

11   unit at Dana-Farber �

12        A.   And Brigham and Women's Hospital, correct.

13        Q.   Brigham and Women's Hospital.

14             And then these doctors go through, they

15   evaluate and do clinical findings, they do their

16   thing, and they decided that they can find out where

17   the primary site is so they can treat the individual

18   and save their life, right?

19        A.   The pathologist, not these doctors, the

20   pathologist is the core of the entire

21   decision-making process, yes.

2 2        Q.   And you've learned that most unknown

2 3       primaries that are later found out to be the primary

2 4       site turn out to be lung cancer, right?

25        A.   Could be lung, could be anything else,

pgNbr=246
3999

1   yes.

2        Q.   That wasn't my question.

3             Most of the time when somebody goes and

4   they have an unknown primary and they determine

5   subsequently what the primary site is, more often

6   than any other cancer, it turns out to be lung

7   primary, doesn't it?

8        A.   Yes.

9        Q.   Okay.  Almost done.  I appreciate your

10   patience.

11        A.   Any time.

13   talked about.

14        A.   Please.

15        Q.   Please.  I'm not looking to challenge you

16   on anything, I just want to talk to you about it.

17        A.   I'm happy to give my opinion.

2 0       hospital, there was no blood in his stool, correct?

21        A.   Correct.

2 2        Q.   So when he presented with stage IV

2 3       widespread metastatic disease throughout his whole

2 4       body, in his brain, his bones, in his mesenteric

2 5       area, the hilar lymph nodes, there was no blood in

1
	his stool
	when he presented, right?

2
	A.
	No, that's right.

3
	Q.
	And then they started treating him with

4
	medications, right?
	
5
	A.
	Right.

6
	Q.
	And you know, if somebody has colon cancer

7
	that's bleeding � has rectal bleeding from colon
	
8
	cancer, you know � you know how to treat that, how
	
9
	you stop
	that bleeding?

10
	A.
	No, I don't.

11
	Q.
	You don't know about surgery to remove the

12
	cancer to
	stop the rectal bleeding?

13
	A.
	So are you asking me about how to treat

14
	cancer or
	the bleeding?  It's different.  That's

15
	what I'm
	saying.

16
	Q.
	I'm sorry, what is different?

17
	A.
	Are you asking me how to treat the

18
	bleeding
	or how to treat the cancer?  I'm confused.

19
	Q.
	If the source of the bleeding �

20
	A.
	Yes.

21
	Q.
	� in the rectum is cancer �

22
	A.
	Yes.  Right.

23
	Q.
	� do you know how they stop the bleeding?

24
	A.
	They have to treat the cancer, right.

25
	Q.
	Right.  And there's � another source of

4001

1   rectal bleeding could be medications, right?

2        A.   Yes, it could be.

3        Q.   And you showed a record where he was on

4   certain NSAIDs, is that what you called it?

5        A.   NSAIDs, yes.

6        Q.   NSAIDs.  And you showed Motrin.

7             So if someone is on one NSAID, that can

8   cause rectal bleeding, you know that?

9        A.   No, it's not.

10        Q.   You don't know that?

11        A.   No, it's upper GI.  But you're saying

12   Motrin actually produces upper GI discomfort.  So

13   when a patient bleeds from the upper GI, not from

14   the rectum, he is not bright red blood per rectum,

15   but this is a different � it's a digestive blood we

16   call it.  So it has a different � it's not a rectal

17   bleed.  That is not what is documented in this.  It

18   is a different type of bleeding.

19        Q.   But how does the bleeding � how does it 2 0       manifest itself through?

21        A.   It's a dark-stain stool.  It's not bright

22   red blood.  It's a different symptom.

2 3        Q.   Okay.  So it's either dark or bright,

2 4       regardless, he had breeding from his rectum?

25        A.   But it's not regardless, it's a different

1
	symptom.
	
2
	Q
	Well, did they note the color of the blood

3
	in the
	medical record?

4
	A
	Yes.  It says "blood per stool."  It's

5
	different.
	
6
	Q
	Blood in the stool.  And the doctor at

7
	that time � he wasn't only on one NSAID, he was on
	
8
	two, right?  He was on Motrin and another
	
9
	medication, both of them, right?
	
10
	A
	I don't know.

11
	Q
	Well, didn't you look?

12
	A
	If you say that, I don't -- I just �

13
	Q
	I'm not testifying.  You told the jury

14
	about one NSAID, which we know can cause bleeding,
	
15
	but he
	was on two, wasn't he?

16
	A
	Okay.

17
	Q
	Well, was he?

18
	A
	I don't think it makes any difference.

19
	Q
	Well, was he?

20
	A
	I don't know.  But if you say �

21
	Q
	Can you look?

22
	A
	� I trust you.

23
	Q
	And at that time �

1        Q.   And we know two weeks later Dr. Roberts,

2   the same doctor who discontinued the medication,

3   wrote that this man had terminal lung cancer, not

4   terminal colon cancer, right?

5        A.   I don't know what you're reading from.

6        Q.   Can you bring it up?

7             Do you see that?

8        A.   Okay.

9        Q.   And then we know on �

10        A.   So "terminally carcinoma with lung mets,"

11   it says there.

12        Q.   Terminal lung cancer.  You've already told

13   the jury, when somebody refers to it as lung cancer,

14   they are referring to the primary site, right?

15   Remember you told us that on direct examination,

16   Doctor?

17        A.   I don't think you're reading right.  This

18   says "terminally," with Y, C-A, carcinoma, comma,

19   "with lung mets."

20             So I think it's � you're doing the wrong

21   thing here.

2 2        Q.   Oh, okay.  I missed that.

2 3                             So this medical record, if it says

2 4        "terminally cancer," which is what you're saying

2 5       under oath that it says, that's important to you,

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=253
4006

1   right?

2        A.   Right.  "With lung mets."  So his �

3        Q.   But if it says "terminal lung cancer,"

4   that would likewise be very important, wouldn't it?

5        A.   Yes, it would be.  But it doesn't make

6   sense, "terminal lung cancer with lung mets."

7        Q.   Okay.  Well, if he had terminal lung

8   cancer with a lung that had metastasized, maybe

9   that's how this doctor wrote it, because it's the

10   same doctor that signed the death certificate two

11   months later, right?

12        A.   I think it's not correct what you're

13   saying.

14        Q.   Okay.  Well, we'll look.

15        A.   It says "terminally carcinoma with lung

16   mets."

17        Q.   Okay.

18        A.   "Lung mets" means metastasis to the lung.

19        Q.   "Terminally" with one "L", right?

2 0       "Terminally" with an "L" and a letter between the

21   "Y", which is not a "G", right?  That's what you're

22   telling this jury, all these people, under oath,

2 3       that you're telling them that your expert opinion at

2 4       Dana-Farber, this is a terminally cancer? 25                  A.   Yes.

1        Q.   Okay.  Thank you.

2             And then we go to the 12/2 note from

3   Dr. Brant, who did write "uncertain primary,"

4   correct?

5        Q.   Do you see that?

6        A.   Yes.

7        Q.   "Widely metastatic adenocarcinoma of an

8   unknown primary."

9             And he had not seen the gentleman for

10   about two months, right?

11        A.   Right.

12        Q.   And you reviewed these medical records,

13   both of the notes from Dr. Brant, right?

14        A.   Right.

15        Q.   One note in September said that he had

16   lung primary when he was treating him, right?

17        A.   Possible.

18        Q.   And another note two months later, when he

19   stopped treating him, said it was an uncertain 2 0       primary, right.

21        A.   Right.

2 2        Q.   And you would agree, Doctor, it would be

2 3       important to know what Dr. Brant � I mean,

2 4       seriously, you're looking at the records, and you

2 5       see these, and it would be important for everybody

1
	to know, what does Dr. Brant have to say about this,
	
2
	right?
	

3
	A.
	I don't agree completely with you.

4
	Q.
	Okay.  So you think it's not important to

5
	know what
	Dr. Brant, who treated the gentleman and

6
	wrote the
	notes, had to say under oath, that's not

7
	important
	to you?

8
	A.
	Partially it is; partially it is not.

9
	Q.
	Let's talk about the partially that is.

10
	Okay?
	

11
	A.
	Right.

12
	Q.
	And so you want to know whether or not

13
	Dr. Brant
	thought it was lymphoma or germ cell,

14
	right?
	

15
	A.
	But it's not Dr. Brant who makes the

16
	diagnosis
	That's why I don't understand your

17
	question.
	It's Dr. Herbert who made the diagnosis.

18
	So Dr. Br<
	ant goes to the same pathologist to get the

19
	diagnosis
	�

20
	Q.
	Sir �

21
	A.
	So, yes, in the world, in a medical

22
	community
	, everybody goes to the pathologist.  So if

23
	Dr. Brant
	interprets one � in one period that it's

24
	possible
	lung cancer, and in this period will show

25
	here "uncertain," it's his own responsibility to

4009

1   believe whatever he wants.

2             But the scientific truth is the one that

3   is depicted by the pathology report where he says

4   it's an adenocarcinoma, it's undifferentiated, and

5   it's poorly differentiated.  So that's �

6        Q.   Doctor, we've been through that.

7        A.   So that's � that's the science.

8        Q.   The pathology said adenocarcinoma.  They

9   didn't have the special staining.

10        A.   Undifferentiated.

11        Q.   Sir, let finish.  They didn't have the

12   special staining, and it went to the clinicians, and

13   they made their clinical diagnosis.  We've been

14   through that, okay?  I'm not trying to do that again

15   with you right now.  I'm trying to finish what we

16   have.

17             All I'm asking you is, this is a

18   gentleman, Dr. Brant, who is a medical doctor who's

19   licensed in the state of Florida, right? He treated 2 0       this gentleman. He tried to help him, and he gave a 21       deposition where he explained both of these notes.

2 2       You read that deposition, didn't you?

23        A.   Yeah.

2 4        Q.   Okay.  And when gave your deposition under

2 5       oath though, you stated that you had not been aware

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=257
4010

1
	that he
	had given a deposition at all, right?

2
	A.
	Right.  And that's what mentioned this

3
	morning
	that basically some of them I missed reading

4
	them �
	

5
	Q.
	And before your deposition �

6
	A.
	� but did not change my opinion about

7
	this at
	all.

8
	Q.
	Right.  Because before you gave your

9
	deposition under oath, you didn't even take the time
	
10
	to read
	Dr. Brant's deposition, did you?

11
	A.
	I did not have the opportunity to read

12
	them because I misplaced them.  And I � I stated
	
13
	that �
	

14
	Q.
	Not only did you misplace them �

15
	A.
	� at the time of deposition.

16
	Q.
	� you told me you had no interest in

17
	reading
	it.

18
	A.
	Yes.  I do not.

19
	Q.
	But you read it after your deposition but

20
	before trial.
	
21
	A.
	Yes.  That's rue.

22
	Q.
	And so when you read his deposition � and

23

1        Q.   Well, do you remember these quotes when

2   you read Dr. Brant's deposition?

3        A.   No, I don't.

4             MR. WARE:  Objection, Your Honor.  Can we

5        take that down and discuss this issue?

6             THE COURT:  Yes.  Come on up.

7              (Sidebar discussion held:)

8             MR. PAIGE:  We gave you the slide before

9        we � we gave it to you.

10             MR. WARE:  Well, I don't know, but my

11        objection is to summarizing Dr. Brant's

12        testimony in this way with this witness.  He's

13        said he read after the fact, and this is just

14        histrionics.  He's already said he didn't read

15        it, so now we are going to go through all the

16        statements of Dr. Brant.  It's prejudicial and

17        it's irrelevant given what the witness has

18        said.

19             THE COURT:  I'm inclined to agree.  I'll

20        let � that long pause was me thinking about

21        whether � whether without the exhibit he ought

22        to be allowed to ask those things of -- some of

23        the questions, but the � the same reason for

24        it --what do you � what do you say?

pgNbr=259
4012

1             THE COURT:  Softly.

2             MR. PAIGE:  A couple of reasons.

3        Number one, he doesn't read it, and he gives a

4        deposition about it, and the doctor who wrote

5        this note that he's relying upon � gave all

6        this important testimony that he wasn't aware

7        of when he gave his sworn testimony, but now

8        before his depo today, he has now � now read

9        this, and I should ask him �

10             THE COURT:  He said � he said it makes no

11        difference.

12             MR. PAIGE:  How can it � actually I'll

13        ask him Dr. Brant, the treating doctor, said

14        it's obvious he had lung cancer.  I treated

15        him.  How can that make no difference,

16        Your Honor?

17             MR. WARE:  Your Honor, Your Honor �

18             MR. PAIGE:  He is not a credible person,

19        you know, and they � and the jury should be

20        able to see that.  That makes no sense.

21             MR. WARE:  This is really a closing 2 2                   argument.

23             THE COURT:  A closing � closing argument.

24        Let me see � let me see your list.

25             MR. PAIGE:  It might not be all of them.

1        I will break a few of them out.

2             THE COURT:  Here is my conclusion.  You

3        may ask him if he acknowledges now that he's

4        read Dr. Brant's deposition that Dr. Brant was

5        now of the opinion that it was primary lung

6        cancer.

7             MR. PAIGE:  Okay.

8             THE COURT:  And then � then if he says,

9        yes, then you can ask the why questions.  Why

10        is that of significance � if you choose to,

11        why is that � why do you consider that.  If he

12        does not acknowledge that, you may ask him

13        about some of the specific statements Dr. Brant

14        made.  Some but not all.  Pick and choose.

8             And then you said, "So they didn't say

9   it's lung cancer.  They said 'probably lung cancer.'

10   So it's a distinction."

11             And I said, "Okay.  So let me see if we

12   can agree.  We can agree nobody said they were

13   100 percent certain it was lung primary, correct?

	undifferentiated carcinoma, and they did not

9
	
	provide a cell of origin because they did not

9             And I said "Okay.  So Dr. Rao, Dr. Iyer

10   Dr. Parikh all said it was most probably lung

11   primary.  Do you agree with those treating

12   physicians that this very well could have been a

13   primary lung primary?"

14             Your answer was, "I partially agree with

15   them.  I also partially disagree.  It could be, but

16   it could be some other primary.  Yes.  I mean they

17   think the same.  It's probably lung, but they don't

3                   REDIRECT EXAMINATION

4     BY MR. WARE

5        Q.   Dr. Chirieac, in the diagnosis of cancer

6   the fact that a number of physicians along the way

7   from September through late September including

8   Dr. Shah as a pulmonologist, Dr. Iyer as a surgeon,

9   Dr. Rao as a medical oncologist, Dr. Parikh as a

10   neurologist, Dr. Roberts as an internist, in the

11   diagnosis of cancer, do they stand around the

12   patient's room and vote on what the diagnosis is?

13        A.   No.  It's not a voting game.

14        Q.   Each of those physicians depended on you

15   or on a pathologist like you, I should say, to

16   determine on a cellular level whether this was or

17   was not cancer; is that correct?

18        A.   Correct.

19        Q. And their opinions � when you � when you 2 0       responded to questions about the importance of those 21       opinions, and that you don't disagree with them, you 2 2       don't disagree that as treating physicians, they had 2 3       to do something because they had to make their �

2 4       the best decisions they could to treat the patient,

4     BY MR. WARE

5        Q.   Regardless what decisions they made as

6   treating physicians, because they needed to make

7   them, the diagnosis of cancer was done by the

8   pathologist?

9             MR. PAIGE:  Objection, Your Honor.

10        A.   Correct.

11             THE COURT:  Sustained.

12     BY MR. WARE

13        Q.   Let me ask you to put up the summary of

14   the doctor's opinions again.  But before we look at

15   those, you can put them up.

16             When a physician throughout the course of

17   September indicates probable lung primary, what does

18   that mean to a trained physician or any other

19   physician?

20        A.   It's � as I mentioned, it's an expression

21   of the degree of uncertainty in making the

22   diagnosis.

2 3                  Q.   And does it mean � well, you tell me.

2 4       Does it mean more likely than not or does � or does

2 5       it mean something else?

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408

1        A.   No, it does not.  It's �

2             MR. PAIGE:  Objection, Your Honor.

3        Speculation as to what these other doctors

4        meant when they wrote what they wrote.

5             THE COURT:  Overruled.

6             MR. WARE:  That wasn't �

7        A.   No, it's not.  It's not accurate that

8   probable in this � in the scientific and medical

9   context has nothing to do with the legal context

10   where most likely than not it's 50 plus one.

11   "Probable" means that the � as any physician in the

12   treating team you're trying to make a guess or to

13   have an option for this poor man that, you know, has

14   no therapeutic option to try to help him somehow.

15        A.

16     BY MR. WARE

17        Q.   All right.  And so when they say probable

18   lung cancer, what they are talking about is given

19   the information they know, that's the decision they 2 0       are making at that moment.

21             MR. PAIGE:  Objection, leading.

22             THE COURT:  Sustained. 2 3            BY MR. WARE

2 4                  Q.   All right.  Directing you again to your

1   cancer was not established, and is it still your

2   opinion that the diagnosis as you indicate here is

3   cancer of unknown primary.

5             MR. WARE:  I have no further questions.

16             THE COURT:  Yeah.  The bailiff did

17        indicate to me that the jury was �

18        anticipating some jury questions from something

16             THE COURT:  Well, I haven't gotten to the

17        question yet.  I am just setting it up for the

18        record.  There is no legal obstacle for going

19        ahead with the question.

20             So here � I'm going to read you the

21        entire thing �

22             THE WITNESS:  Sure.

23             THE COURT:  � and then it's your turn.

24        There's two separate questions.

25             The entirety is as follows, "What do you

1        believe the mass in the lung was or could be?

2        Explain.

3             "How does the cancer" � I'm sorry, "How

4        does cancer generally or usually present when

5        it has metastasized to the lung?  Explain the

6        way in which it spreads and how it presents."

7             The comment is, "The term 'metastasis' was

8        touched on, but I would like a full explanation

9        of these things from the doctor if that is

10        allowable."

11             So returning to question one, "What do you

12        believe the mass in the lung was or could be,"

13        and "Explain why."

14             THE WITNESS:  Right.  So the mass in the

15        lung, my opinion is most likely to be a

16        carcinoma of unknown primary.  So it's � some

17        cancer that we do not know the origin from.

18        And the majority of all these lumps, nodules

19        and masses everywhere in Mr. Duignan's body are

20        basically coming from an unknown origin, and

21        that's the explanation of the � of the

22        mesenteric mass, so the mass in the belly, mass

23        in the lung, mass in the � you know, in the

24        brain, and in the bone and the right

25        temporal � temporal skull and in the left �

1        the left pelvic bone.

2             THE COURT:  And the second part is, and

3        it's sort of a multipart itself:  How does

4        cancer generally or usually present when it has

5        metastasized to the lung?  And please explain

6        the way in which it spreads and how it

7        presents.

8             THE WITNESS:  This is a very good

9        question.  The way we see the lung being

10        involved by metastasis is in two major ways.

11        One way, it's exactly what we mentioned and

12        discussed in the morning, is the shotgun

13        approach, so multiple little nodules across the

14        lung, and then when the pathologist or when the

15        imaging radiologist looks at lung, he sees

16        multiple nodules involving both lobes or both

17        lungs.

18             At that time, the major � the next step

19        is the surgeon goes in, cracks the chest open

20        in here, makes a small incision, puts a camera.

21        The procedure is called VATS, video-assisted

22        thoracic surgery.  And with a tube goes and

23        removes a part of the � a part of the lung

24        with one of the little nodules.  This is called

25        a wedge resection.  It's like you're wedging an

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=279
4032

1        apple if you want.

2             And then you send it to the pathology.

3             And then in the pathology � we have

4        majorly two answers.  Number one, we say it's a

5        lung cancer metastatic.  Remember that even if

6        a patient has lung cancer, it could metastasize

7        everywhere in a stipple manner, or it could be

8        a metastases for colon, for example.  So they

9        were classic � the kidney likes to do that,

10        they shot multiple little mets in the lung.

11             However, the second important pattern, and

12        this is why my role is very important, is some

13        of this patients could have � and we see that

14        every day, some of the patients have only one

15        nodule.  And the patient comes to the surgeon,

16        the thoracic surgeon is like, well, you know,

17        it's in the lung, like this story, it's in the

18        lung, it's lung cancer.  The patient is a

19        smoker, that's it.

20             And then when you actually look at the,

21        you know, the lung, then if you do more

22        investigation and you find out, for example,

23        that could be a woman who ten years ago had a

24        breast nodule, been resected for breast cancer,

25        then you do an investigation and you find out

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=280
4033

1        this is a metastasis to the lung.  This

2        metastasis actually is called oligometastasis.

3             So there are cancers that like to spread

4        only by one single mass to the lung.  Notorious

5        tumors like that are breast cancer, colon

6        cancer, I've seen colorectal cancer, like

7        patient done well and fine, and ten years

8        later, boom, lung cancer.

9             And it's very important to understand, is

10        that a primary lung, because patients would

11        have two cancers, one 10 years ago, a new one

12        now.  Or it's a distant met from the past.  And

13        it could go either way.  It could go in one

14        direction, it could go another direction.

15        Kidney cancers could look like that.  Prostate

16        cancers could look like that.

17             So to answer the question is, we see two

18        major patterns of metastases.  Oligometastasis

19        where it is one big lump, nodule, to the lung,

20        or it's multiple like we talked this morning,

21        the multiple approach, like gunshot, where the

22        lung is involved diffusely by metastasis.

23             Did I answer the question?

24             THE COURT:  And the next question:  How

25        does cancer generally or usually present when

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=281
4034

1        it has metastasized to the lung?  Explain the

2        way in which it spreads and how it presents.

3             THE WITNESS:  So that's how it spreads.

4        It's either spread in multiple � the way to

5        think usually it spreads through some

6        specialized vessels.  They are called

7        lymphatics.  And those lymphatics are vessels

8        that carry lymph.  It's a special fluid that it

9        circulates in our body, and then it's made by

10        lymphocytes.  That's why it's called lymph.

11             And it's a completely separate vascular

12        system than the blood system.  This lymphatic

13        system is a very complex and complicated

14        network of vessels.  And along the vessel there

15        are these lymph nodes that we talked this

16        morning, and cancer likes to spread along this

17        network of lymphatic vessels in systems, travel

18        to them.  Sometimes it's � they are locating

19        inside the lymph nodes, and then, you know  the

20        lymph nodes become metastatic with that

21        particular disease.

22             And that's the reason how, you know,

23        that's the explanation that why some tumors in

24        distant places like ovarian tumor or colorectal

25        tumor, many years later they crawl through this

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=282
4035

1        vascular system and they lodge in the lung.

2             And then you are going to ask me, okay,

3        why is lung and not other place?

4             Well, there are some organs that are more

5        notorious than others that be the terminal

6        stations, terminal stops for these vessels, for

7        these lymphatic vessels.  One of them is lung,

8        one of them is bone, one of them is brain.  So

9        they go there and they cannot circulate

10        later � further.

11             There is even like newer hypotheses to

12        speculate, and actually they are actually true,

13        we've been involved in some research to show

14        that particular patients with cancer, if you

15        take the blood out of a patient like that and

16        you put it in a specific machine, you can

17        detect lung cancer or colorectal cancer, any

18        kind of cancer from the blood.

19             And this is what the modern efforts are

20        right now focused to try to diagnose cancer in

21        a very noninvasive way, put the syringe, get

22        this, put it in the machine.  And it's called

23        circulating tumor cells or CTC.  And it's a

24        very active area of investigation nowadays, and

25        this is what some my colleagues are involved

www.phippsreporting.com (888)811-3408
pgNbr=283
4036

1        in, to try to isolate these cancer cells from

2        the blood.  And can you imagine, they are

3        circulating all over the place, and then, you

4        know, randomly one goes in the brain, stops

5        there, and then they multiply there.  One goes

6        in the lung, stops there, multiplies there.

7             THE COURT:  Thank you.

8             Does either counsel have a follow-up

1        news.  The second layer of good news is I

3        thought we would be going to start earlier next

8        news, which is that I'm about to wish you a

9        happy Labor Day weekend.

10             I can't do that without taking the

11        opportunity, and forgive me for being

12        redundant, but you might be at that BBQ

13        Saturday and see somebody you haven't seen for

14        a while.  If you're asked what you've been up

15        to, you say, well, I've had kind of an

16        interesting couple of past weeks.

17             It would be a very natural thing to do,

18        but it would be a slippery slope.  And so

19        again, all the smiling and happy faces aside,

20        it would be a very egregious violation of your

21        oath as jurors to disclose anything about this

14             I think � I think it's important on

15        behalf of Defendants that they preserve this

16        issue.  I have read Hallgren before and

17        concluded that I'm bound by it.  I realize

18        there's some subsequent case law that sets up

19        kind of an even in spite of Hallgren kind of

20        argument.  But at the inception, of this case,

21        I looked at that � of our present case, I

22        looked at the case law too and was not

23        persuaded.

24             Now, I think I � Mr. Michael, you've done

25        such a great job, I hate to cut you off and

1        rule against you.  If you got something on top

2        of those two things to say on this, I'll

3        certainly entertain it.

4             MR. MICHAEL:  No, Your Honor.

5             THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, then I'm going to

6        deny the motion for directed verdict across the

7        board.

8             MR. MICHAEL:  Both motions, Your Honor?

9             THE COURT:  Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.

10             Yes.  I just wanted to double-check there

11        wasn't anything in there I hadn't accounted

12        for.  No.

13             And � and I guess that's it until we pick

14        up Tuesday morning, and we have charge

15        conference Tuesday evening.

16             MR. MICHAEL:  I just watched to hand up to

17        you, we filed today a request for one

18        additional instruction for Tuesday.

19             THE COURT:  Okay.  Great.  I'll put it in

20        the trial folder.

21             MR. MICHAEL:  I gave it to Gary.

22             THE COURT:  Oh, no �

23             MR. MOLONY:  You asked me to take care of

24        it, so �

25             THE COURT:  Oh, that's the exhibit.

1             MR. MOLONY:  Yes, sir.

2             THE COURT:  Well, that's okay.  That goes

3        to the clerk.  I thought you were bringing me

4        more mandatory reading.

5             MR. MOLONY:  No, no, no, no.

6             THE COURT:  Okay, good.  Thank heavens.

7             MR. MOLONY:  I'm all about simplifying,

8        particularly on a Friday afternoon.

9             THE COURT:  You are singing my tune.

10             So what is it you would like to simply

11        say?

12             MR. MOLONY:  What I would like to explain

13        and put on the record is that the exhibit which

14        has been offered as the complete set of medical

15        records, we've gotten past the tabs and all

16        that.

17             THE COURT:  Okay.

18             MR. MOLONY:  Brought somebody over, went

19        through our set of � we went through that set

20        of records, found four from our key set that

21        are medical records, that with the addition of

22        these four, they have to be redacted yet,

23        because I think there is some things in there

24        that should have been redacted.  With the

25        addition of those four, then we don't have a

1        problem with them saying that this is a

2        complete set of medical records for purposes of

3        this case.

4             THE COURT:  You want to make it a mutual

5        exhibit?

6             MR. MOLONY:  No.  Thank you.

7             THE COURT:  Okay.

8             MR. MOLONY:  No, sir.  I just wanted to

9        make �

10             THE COURT:  I understand.  Complete is

11        complete.

12             MR. MOLONY:  I'm trying to get past my

13        objection is all.

14             THE COURT:  I hear you.  So here is the

15        deal.  If I may �

16             MR. MOLONY:  The whole time �

17             THE COURT:  Do you mind if I have the

18        floor for a moment?

19             MR. PHILIPSON:  I'm sorry.  I apologize.

20             THE COURT:  Here is what I'm directing.  I

21        already said you had until Tuesday morning.  So

22        subject to those redactions � has the

23        Plaintiff seen these things yet?

24             MR. MOLONY:  No, sir.  We just discovered

25        that while the testimony was coming in.

1             THE COURT:  Okay.  But assuming they are

2        part of the medical record and it's just a

3        question of redacting social security numbers

4        and the like, I'm going to assume that

5        that's � that's ministerial and you can tweak

6        the set and actually present it on the record

7        to be admitted Tuesday morning before I call

8        the jury in.

9             That's your thought, that's your

10        intention?

11             MR. MOLONY:  That's my expectation,

12        Your Honor.

13             THE COURT:  That's my expectation also.

14             You guys get -- he says four pages.

15             MR. MOLONY:  Right.  We'll send them to

16        them.

17             THE COURT:  I think you can probably do

18        that before you knock off today.

19             MR. PAIGE:  They look fine to me.  Just

20        redact them, and tell me where you want me to

21        put them in the record.

22             MR. MOLONY:  We'll coordinate with him,

23        and then on Tuesday take care of things.  I

24        just wanted to move past that obstacle.

25             THE COURT:  God bless you.
