Q. Do you think you'll meet your goals this year?

A.  I think that's possible, yes.

Q.  Is it possible, sir, or is it probable?

A.  I'm not in a position to know the answer to that yet in that it involves financial information that I don't have access to. We'll have to wait and see. It's my personal opinion that it's possible, even likely that we'll meet our goals.

Q.      Do you also receive stock, sir?

A. I don't receive stock as such. No, I do receive a long-term incentive. And that does come in the form of stock after it has vested.

A.  Again, 2014 is not complete. I don't have those figures in my head. So I don't know that we can � first of all without the year being complete, I don't think I can answer that question. My understanding is that to this point in time we have been profitable in 2014.

Q.  Just so that the record here is clear and the jury knows the dates, today ia December 16th, 2014, correct?

A.  That's correct, yes.

Q.  And from January 1st, 2014 to today, December 16th, 2014, isn't it true that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has made more in profits than it did in the calendar year 2013?

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.

A.  I would need to review those figures.  I don't know that that's true or not. I know it's been a profitable year.

A.  I have no set frequency. There can be weeks at a time or months even that I don't really look at it. There can be times where I look at it multiple times in a week.

Q.  When was the last time that you looked at the value of your stock in R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, sir?

A.  I looked at the share price a couple of days ago. I noticed the market in Reynolds stock declined, there was a significant decline currently going on. And so I looked to see what it was at.

Q.  What was the total value of your portfolio, your stock in R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company when you last reviewed the share price?

A.  When I last looked at it, I looked at the share price, I didn't look at the total value"*of the shares that I have. So I was looking at share price itself. But in terms of the total value, it

Page 20 Q.  Which cases have you testified in court in Florida since the Wilcox case?

A.  There would be a case, I believe, by the name of Robinson.  I would need to go and refresh and look at the other names. I don't have them immediately in my mind. Let's see.

Q.  So Robinson is one case. Any others?

A.  Yes. There would be two cases in Miami and there would also be at least one other case after that as well, I believe.

Q.   So let me simplify my question.  How many cases have you testified in court in Florida since the Wilcox case in May of 2014?

A.  I believe four.

Q,  Have you � did you give depositions in each of those four cases, as best you can recall?

A.  As best I can recall, no. I would not have provided a deposition in each case, only when a deposition was requested.

Q.      Okay.  Can you recall offhand how many depositions you have given since the summer of this year?

A.  Since the summer of this year I believe I've only given one or two depositions.

A.  I'm there.

Q.  The third line states, Dr. Borgerding's expert opinions and testimony are based on his three decades of direct experience working as a scientist at Reynolds.

Is that accurate?

A.  Yes, I've worked at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for more than three decades.

Q.  So more than 30 years you've worked for R.J. Reynolds, correct?

A.  That's correct, yes.

Q.  Okay. Going down a couple of lines, the document says you will testify based on your knowledge of, among other things, chemistry, tobacco and smoke chemistry and cigarette design. Do you see that line, Doctor?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  All right.  Starting with chemistry, Doctor, and we're going to get into your qualifications here in a second.  I believe you are a chemist, correct?

A.  Yes, I am.

A.  Yes, there are compounds in the cigarette smoke of all cigarettes, including R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

Q. And can we agraa that the compounds in the � the chemical compounds in R.J. Reynolds cigarette smoke causes lung cancer?

A.  In terms of the exact mechanism of lung cancer and the compounds that may be involved, that's still an active area of research. It's been summarized in, for example, recent Surgeon General, report, a report. There have been a number of compounds that have been reported as compounds that may contribute. But as far as the exact compounds, I don't think that that's known yet. There's not a consensus about the specific-compounds.

Q.  Well, you're not saying that there are no compounds in R.J. Reynolds cigarette smoke that cause lung cancer, are you, sir?

A. No. What I'm trying to communicate to you is that it's been an active area of research for 50 years to try and understand the composition of smoke, to understand the potential biological activity of individual compounds themselves, and then to understand the biological activity when you

Page 23 have a complex mixture that would have those same compounds at very small amounts. Currently the state of the science is that while there are a number of compounds that have been identified, for example, by the FDA as hazardous and potentially hazardous, the exact specific compounds that may cause a disease in an individual haven't been completely identified. So we have a group of about a hundred compounds that have been focused upon. But there's still more research to be done in that regard.

Q.  Well, can't we agree, sir, that smoking R.J. Reynolds cigarettes causes lung cancer?

A.  Cigarette smoking can cause lung cancer in some individuals, yes.

Q.  And cigarette smoking R.J. Reynolds " cigarettes in some individuals can cause lung cancer, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now, you are aware that Marion Dion, Mr. Dion's wife, died in 1994 of lung cancer? MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.

A.  That is my understanding in terms of the documents that I've read, yes.

Q.  So even though you're not a medical doctor, as a chemist, can we agree today that more likely than not Marion Dion's lung cancer was caused by smoking R.J. Reynolds cigarettes?

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.

A.  I'm not in a position to make any type of a medical diagnosis. And as far as what may have caused the lung cancer, I'm not in a position to say one way or the other. Clearly there's a risk for lung cancer from smoking. And some individuals that smoke do develop lung cancer.

Q.  As a chemist and as an expert witness for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, are you aware of any other cause that may exist for Marion Dion's lung cancer and death other than smoking R.J. Reynolds cigarettes?

The information that I've reviewed is quite limited and focused. And the only information about any types of exposures are in terms of smoking cigarettes, and quite a number of different brands from different manufacturers.

A.  My role has not been as a product developer as such. I've been one that's evaluated cigarette design. So I've done testing, both very specific testing and broad programs of testing for many different cigarette designs.

So my knowledge of cigarette design is from working with colleagues that do develop products, but also working with the evaluation of those products in the various designs.

Q.  And those hazardous compounds that have been identified in the smoke of R.J. Reynolds cigarettes were there when you began in 1980 with the company and they are there present in the smoke of R.J. Reynolds cigarettes today, December 16th, 2014; is that �~ is that a fair statement?

A.  If by your statement you mean that they're there in the same amounts, that would not necessarily be so. The research efforts of the last 50 years have been to, first of all, try and identify compounds that may be associated with the risks of smoking cigarettes. And then to try and reduce those compounds.

So if your question is are all of the compounds present? For many products they may still be present, but reduced. We have developed some cigarettes, for example, cigarettes that heat rather than burn tobacco whereby many of these compounds have been essentially eliminated or at least we're not able to detect them with our current limits of detection.

So when you ask have they been present at all times? For products that only burn tobacco,

limits of our analytical capabilities. But they

would not be necessarily be present in the same

amounts because of the efforts that have gone on

for many years have been to reduce them.

Q.  Sir, can we agree that Americans that smoked R.J. Reynolds cigarettes in 1980 when you first began at the company died from lung cancer?

A.  There were individuals that did have lung cancer in that time frame, yes.

Q.  And can we agree that today, December 16th, 2014, there are Americans dying of lung cancer that smoked R.J. Reynolds Tobacco cigarettes?

A.  Yes, there continues to be a risk for lung cancer. That has been a focus of our research earths to try and identify what drives that and to reduce or eliminate it.

Q.  So to boil it down, smokers died then in 1980 and they're still dying today in 2014; you'd agree with that, wouldn't you, sir?

A.  There are smokers that do die, yes, from smoking*related diseases.

Page 36 It's my impression that he would have worked there for a number of years.

Q.  Well, if I told you that he was promoted up the chain of command to hold the position of director of research, Dr. Senkus' position in 1973, if I told you Dr. Teague was promoted to that position in 1981, would you agree or disagree?

A.  That's not my understanding. My understanding of Dr. Teague's role at the time that I was at the company, the first few years, he would have been responsible for the technical services area. He wasn't leading the � the research department.

And, in fact, about the time that I joined the company, the research and the development departments merged to become the   � ... ^ Research and Development Department. But it was headed by Dr. Roy Morse and ultimately by Dr. Robert DiMarco, not by Dr. Teague.

Q.  Well, you worked under Dr. Teague at least until he retired in 1987; is that correct?

A.   No,

Q.  Well, what was your position in relation to Dr. Teague while you worked at the company?

Q.  Were you � did you � have you ever held a position as high as Dr. Teague held in October of 1973, which was assistant director for the research department?

A.  In terms of the title assistant director, I'm a senior director, which I don't know how the structures would compare. In terms of the department, it's quite different today than it was then. We had a much smaller research department at that point in time. But from an absolute title standpoint, my title is � as we � as I indicated in an earlier answer, senior director. And this chart indicates that Dr. Teague was an assistant director.

Q.  So Dr. Teague was, we can agree, in October of 1973 an executive for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, correct?

A,  Again, I don't know what would have constituted an executive.  In terms of what would constitute an executive at the company today, this would not be that type of position.

Q.  Well, let's look at Dr. Teague in � according to this R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

A.  Dr. Rodgman was also a chemist. I believe that he may have held at least one or more degrees in biochemistry as well. I would need to review his CD, but � CV, rather. But he was a chemist or biochemist by training.

Q.  And there was a physical chemistry dsDftrtufint at that time cor reef

But as I look.at this statement, it seems to be aa aeTmoWledgtnent of'what the Surgeon General was saying in 1964.

Q.  Well, did R.J. Reynolds take this � say this publically to the American public in 1972 when Dr. Teague wrote it?

A.  It was already public information from the Surgeon General in 1964, I don't know that the company stated this at that time in this way.

Q.   Right.

Well, we can agree, Doctor, can we not, that R.J. Reynolds' public position in 1972 to the Surgeon General, to the public health authorities and to smokers like Marion Dion was that nicotine was not habituating and was not addictive and did not cause disease?

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.

As I read this statement, I believe that it's consistent with what the Surgeon General was saying and, in fact, may well have been influenced by what the Surgeon General was saying.  I don't know what was in Dr. Teague's mind at that time.

Q.  Well, if you look down at the last paragraph on the third page, Dr. Teague writes, if tobacco is the sine qua non of tobacco products, and tobacco products are recognized as being attractive dosage forms of nicotine, then it is logical to design our products, and where possible our advertising, around nicotine delivery.

Did I read that accurately, sir? A.  Other than not completing the sentence, I believe you did, yes.

Q.  Okay. And that is what Dr. Teague wrote in 1973, correct?

As best I can tell, and I don't know, this seems to be a document that he wrote for his own purposes. It doesn't have the normal review or approval process.

So I've never seen this type of document anywhere else at any point, something called a research planning memorandum.

Q.  Well, why would it say R.J.R, and be marked confidential on the first page, sir?

A. I don't know other than I'm assuming that he committed this to paper at work, and as such, it was a confidential document.

Q.  Doctor, would you look at the page four of the document that's marked PT 04791-0004?

A.  I'm on that page. It's dash 0004, yes.

Q. Look at the second paragraph, the second line, Dr. Teague wrote in this confidential R.J.R. document, quote, it may be well to consider another

A.  I don't know what he was thinking when he wrote this document. I recognize the words that you're saying here. These are not terms that I've been � that I've seen in the course of my career with Reynolds. To my knowledge, he may have just been creating thoughts for himself in this type of document. Taken literally � taken literally, presmoker would mean before smoking.

Q.  Would you agree, sir, that presmoker a may refer to teenagers?

A.  That would not be my impression here. There's no indication of that in terms of the word. And, again, he's not speaking to that as such.

Q.  Well, Doctor, would you agree as a chemist employed by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company that the additives and ingredients in cigarettes are part of the cigarette design?

A.  In terms of the design of the product, the design of the product from my standpoint would include the paper, the filter the tobacco and so on. And in terms of the taste profile of the product, what differentiates one product from another, I think that that would be something that would be related to flavor compounds, for example. So it is part of the overall design. But it is something that distinguishes based upon taste.

Q.  Okay.  But that's part of the overall design of your product, correct?

A.  Yes, without the specific legal aspects of those transactions, the American Tobacco Company was acquired by Brown & Williamson; Brown & Williamson and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company have merged is my understanding.

MR. LATHAM: Objection to the form.

A.  Well, as I just indicated in my answer, those entities have combined in various ways. Not necessarily all the brands from those companies exist today at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

Did I read that accurately ly?

A.  Other than the fact that you substituted the word companies for manufacturers, you did.

Q.  So can we agree that this document was released by R.J. Reynolds in 1994?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And can we agree that this document contains, according to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, a complete list of ingredients used by the companies whose names appear on the front cover sheet?

A.  Yes, I believe so.

19      Q.  And the first part of that sentence is a

20  restatement of what you told us aarliar about adding

21  materials to cigarettes to affect flavor, correct?

22      A.  Yes, I indicated that some flavor

released by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company in 1994. If you would go to page five, sir.

A.  I'm there.

Q.  The document states that one of the adoitives and ingredients in cigarettes in 1994 was amntonia, correct?

A.  Yes, it does state that.

Q.  And it also states that one of the ingredients in the R.J. Reynolds and other cigarette companies' product in 1994 was ammonium bicarbonate, correct?

A.  Again, I may not have listened to your last question well. I need to make a distinction that my understanding of this document is that it's a composite list of what would have been used in the cigarettes of the various manufacturers listed, and it's not clear for any given compound in this list which cigarettes or manufacturers.

So the fact that it's present in this document or in this list doesn't necessarily mean that it was contained in a R.J. Reynolds Tobacco product brand.

Q.  On page 15 of this document the composite list of ingredients includes levulinic acid as an ingredient contained in at least some of the manufacture of cigarettes, correct?

Is that accurate today?

Q.  Okay,  let me call your attention to Exhibit F, sir.

Are you familiar with the most recent U.S. Surgeon General's report concerning the health consequences of smoking?

A.  Generally, yes. I don't have it memorized as such, but I'm aware of it and have read through it.

Q.  All right. And would you agree that the conclusions in the executive summary are true and accurate?

A.  I don't know that I've assessed each of the conclusions and so on.  I take the report to be a compilation of much epidemiology to put together a view of what has been learned over a long period

Q.  Well, the U.S. Surgeon General in the report that Reynolds refers consumers to, in the executive summary states, for the United States, the epidemic of smoking-caused disease in the 20th century ranks among the greatest public health catastrophes of the century.

Do you see that, sir?

A.  I do see that, yes.

Q.  Do you believe that is accurate?

A.  I don't know that I would characterize, it that way. What I can tell you is that over the course of my lifetime and my career, the risks of smoking have been studied and the work that I and my colleagues have done for many years is to try and understand what drives that risk and to try and have products that reduce the risks associated with smoking.

As far as this statement, my understanding is there are many different things currently in the popular press and in the literature that look at risks in our day-to-day life.  For example, obesity is one that's been in the press often times. I take the statement,

Q.  Well, you � the Surgeon General in the most recent report states, 20 million Americans have died from smoking-related disease since the first Surgeon General's report in 1964.

You're aware that's the position of the Surgeon General today?

Are you aware of that?

A.  Yes, I'm aware that depending upon the Surgeon General or the CDC, there are various figures put forward.  From my personal perspective, the fact that there are any individuals at risk, I think we need to work to understand the risks and reduce the risks �

1       Q.  Right.

2           So millions of Americans have died from

3  smoking since you have been in R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

4  Company, correct?

5       A.  Again, I don't know the exact figure.

6  But I know there's a risk for smoking-related

7  disease. People have died from smoking-related

8  disease. That's why I've worked at the company to

9  try and understand and reduce that risk. I don't

10  want the risk to be there.

11       Q.  Well, if you don't want the risk to be

12  there, sir, why does R.J. Reynolds still sell today

13  combustible cigarettes that cause lung cancer and

14  death?

15      A.  Cigarettes are a legal product within our

16  society. Our Congress, our country has decided

17  that those are products that are legal and will

18  continue to be products in the U.S. If Reynolds

19  stopped selling cigarettes, it's my expectation

20  that that would not have an effect. There would

21  still be cigarettes in our society.

22           So I think the key is to understand what

23  drives the risk of all cigarettes, no matter who

24  would manufacture and sell them, and to try and

25  reduce those risks.

And as importantly, for those that are concerned about the risks of smoking, to provide products that would help them stop smoking.

Q.  Well, first of all, sir, you would agree this is America and R.J. Reynolds is under no government or other obligation to sell a product that has caused 20 million deaths over the last 40 or 50 years?

There's no law that says Reynolds has to sell a combustible cigarette, is there?

A.  I'm not a lawyer, I'm not an expert in the responsibilities of boards of companies and so on. The history of our company is we are a tobacco company. Our society has looked at cigarettes many times over the years and concluded that they are a legal product in the United States. Reynolds has worked to always produce products that are of the highest quality. And at the same time, to understand what drives the risks of products, to try and reduce those risks, but also to try and

A. As far as the future of the company, what I can tell you is that we have a � I'm sorry, this is falling off, perhaps.

We have a strategy to transform tobacco. It's articulated very clearly, for example, on our website.  It's something that's been talked about in the public press�.. It's something that we're working very diligently towards in terms of providing products that have the potential to reduce risk and to move people away from combustible products.

that would be associated with less risk for smoking-related diseases.  Excuse me.

It's my personal opinion that if R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company were to stop selling cigarettes, that would not change the availability of cigarettes in the United States today.

Q.  Well, in your personal opinion, if R.J. Reynolds stopped selling cigarettes tomorrow, wouldn't that result in less smoking-related deaths in the future?

Page 77 combustible cigarettes, could that be what is driving R.J. Reynolds to continue to sell cigarettes today?

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.

A.  It's my view that Reynolds, number one, is a tobacco company. Always has been a tobacco company. That our current focus is on transforming tobacco. We recognize that cigarettes are a legal product and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future in the United States. And as such, it is one type of product that we manufacture and sell.  It is not the only.

We recognize that there will be a period of migration whereby smokers will migrate from combustible products to either quitting or to using other products with time. It's not something that will happen in a � in a single day. But it is the focus of what we're trying to do. We're trying to transform tobacco and move away from combustible products.

Q.  Well, one of the products that you're trying to move people to is a product called � a smokeless tobacco product called SNUS, correct?

3           But for those that want to use tobacco,

4  one type of tobacco that would be associated with

A.  Yes, in terms of the tobacco product risk continuum, this is a product that � the Vuse product is a product that contains no tobacco. There's nothing that's burned. It's something that's very simple aerosol. It is something that provides an opportunity for those that want to continue to use an aerosol-producing product to consider instead of smoking cigarettes.  It would expose them to a much simpler aerosol. Many of the thousands of compounds in cigarette smoke would be absent.

Q.  So Vuse contains no tobacco, but it does contain nicotine; does it not?

A.  It does contain nicotine derived from tobacco. But it does not contain any tobacco.

Q.  And so would you agree that Vuse is a nicotine-delivery device?

A.  It is a electronic cigarette.  It's a cigarette that will produce an aerosol that contains nicotine.  It's not � it's something that is currently being deemed by the FDA. My understanding is that in that deeming regulation, it is going to be part of the Center for Tobacco Products. So it would not be classified as a device.  It would be classified as a tobacco

A.  We can continue for a bit longer. It's fine with me.

q.  Premier was a smokeless cigarette that Reynolds released in the United States in 1988, correct?

A.  The popular press characterized Premier as a smokeless cigarette. That's not technically an accurate description of it in that it was a cigarette that produced a very different type of smoke aerosol. Again, one that was far simpler than cigarettes that burned tobacco because it only heated tobacco. But there was a visible aerosol, something that looked like smoke, that was composed largely of glycerol and water. But it was introduced in 1988,  It was a cigarette Chat-tfeatea. tobacco rather than burned it.

3      A.  Yes, in that time frame.

4       Q.  And it was withdrawn from the market

5  because no one wanted to buy it, right?

6      A.  It was withdrawn from the market as a

7  business decision. It had been put into three lead

8  markets or test markets at that time to understand

9  if consumers would consider that cigarette rather

10  than their usual brand of cigarette. It was

11  something that had a lot of press around it. And I

12  think the popular press probably set up

13  expectations that it would taste very much like

14  someone's usual brand of cigarette.

15           In fact, it tasted differently, it

16  smelled differently. The way that it was lit was

17  different. So it was a completely different

18  smoking experience; And in that time we were able

19  to learn that it was something that smokers of that

20  day were not ready to rapidly adjust to.

21       Q.  Simple terms, consumers didn't want to buy

22  it, right? Hasn't a big seller?

23.lM    A.  There was tremendous trial of the

Q.  And so if E.J. Reynolds is going to put a product on the market that's not selling, that means R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's not going to make much money on that product, right?

A.  Well, Reynolds invested a billion dollars in the development of Premier because it was a product that had the potential to reduce the risks of smoking. It is a product that lead to subsequent products that are still on the market today. So Reynolds has tremendously invested in research and development of products to reduce risk. Those products also, though, have to be acceptable*to smokers. And so that's the great challenge, when you change the products fundamentally in terms of their smoke or aerosol composition, is finding something that a smoker will consider rather than their usual brand of cigarette.

Q.  So would you consider Premier to have been a predecessor to the current Eclipse products sold by Reynolds?

A.  I would not only consider it to be, it's a fact that it was.

A.  Again, I would not use the term smokeless. Eclipse is a cigarette that primarily heats rather than burns tobacco.  So, again, with premier and with Eclipse, what it's trying to do is limit the incomplete combustion of tobacco. It's that incomplete combustion of tobacco that produces the many compounds associated with the risks of smoking, the harmful and potentially harmful compounds.

And so like Premier, Eclipse is designed to primarily heat.  It does burn a small amount of tobacco. It's smoke aerosol, does contain glycerol, it does contain nicotine, it does contain tobacco flavors, tobacco-related compounds.

Q.  So we can agree that Eclipse, the product sold by Reynolds today, that you want to migrate people to, contains nicotine, right?

A.  The product contains nicotine and the smoke from the product would yield nicotine.

To your earlier question, it is a product that we lose money when we sell it and we continue to try and sell this product.

Q.  Okay.  Doctor, calling your attention back to Exhibit E, which is the � the guiding principle on the website of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

Is the American Cancer Society one of the public health and medical officials that Reynolds is referring to for tobacco consumers to look to to get information about products?

A.  In terms of Reynolds' guiding principle and belief, it doesn't specify the various individual groups. But I think generally they would fall into that category would be my opinion.

Q.  And isn't it true that the American cancer Society argues that Eclipse should be removed from the marketplace?

A.  � I'm sorry, if I may, counselor.  I hadn't finished.

It's my view and expectation that they would defer to the FDA, who is responsible for regulating all tobacco products, including Eclipse, to make such a determination.

Q.  But you would concede that the American Cancer Society has advocated that Eclipse be removed from the marketplace?

A.  I would need to review through. It's possible in years past they may have. I don't know that that would be their position today.

Q.  Okay. Anything else you want to add?

A.  It says that, yes.

Q.  We've just gone over how you claim R.J. Reynolds is trying to migrate smokers to smokeless tobacco. We went over that already, correct?

A.  You're communicating part of what I tried to provide in my earlier answer, which is migration strategy isn't.about migrating smokers to smokeless toiSacco.  It's about migrating those that are smokers and concerned about the risks of smoking to quitting if they would like to do that or if they want to keep using tobacco, to forms of tobacco that would have less risks for smoking-related oiseases.

Q.  Well, one of the risks to smokeless tobacco, including Camel SNUS has today, according to the CDC, is that use of that product can lead to nicotine dependence, correct?

A.  Yes, it says that.

Q.      Okay. And according to the CDC, as of yesterday, nicotine dependence is the most common form of chemical dependence in the United States; is that correct?

A.  Again, if you're trying to capture what I've indicated to you about our migration strategy in my earlier answers, that doesn't capture what I'm trying to communicate to you about the migration strategy.  If your question is when someone uses smokeless tobacco, are they exposed to nicotine? The answer is yes.

Q.      Well, sir, don't addicted � don't consumers that are addicted to nicotine purchase more products that contain nicotine than people who are not addicted?

A.  My understanding is that in terms of tobacco products, they contain nicotine, as do nicotine replacement therapy products, products that are intended to help people stop smoking, for example. It's also my understanding that in terms of those that smoke or use other tobacco products, not everyone is classified as dependent upon or addicted to nicotine.

I think that what's important to understand is that in terms of smokers that smoke for a wide range of reasons. For some I think nicotine may be the most important reason, for others it isn't. Likewise, for smokeless tobacco I believe that would be true. I should �

Q.  Wouldn't you agree with that? MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.

Q.  Well, it's not an attempt to characterize anything.  It's just a question, a simple question.

common sense, who are addicted to products containing nicotine will buy more of those products than people who are not addicted; can we agree to that? It's a simple yes or no.

MR. LATHAM: Objection to form. A.  No, as a matter of my understanding of the facts, I don't think that that's necessarily so.

That when tobacco consumers decide to quit using tobacco products, some do it with very little difficulty, others it can be very difficult.  It just depends upon the individual is my understanding.

A.  Again, I would need to read it carefully. But even in the sections that I was asked to read today, it's clear that there are a number of places where it begins with if.

Q.  Is that one of the reasons why you characterized the document earlier in the deposition as a hypothetical discussion that Dr. Teague was having with himself?

A.  Yes. He seems to be postulating and putting forward ifs without any true rationale. Merely seems to be a thought exercise on his part.

Q.  On page three in the quote that Mr. Wichmann had you read, if nicotine is the sine qua non of tobacco products, does that sentence begin with the word if?

A.  Yes, it does.

Q.  If you'll turn to page four.

There's a sentence that begins with the word however in the top paragraph.

Do you see that top paragraph?

A.   I do.

Q.      Do you see the sentence that begins with the word however?

A.  Yes, there's one towards the end of the

Page 106 paragraph that begins with however.

Q.  Will you read that sentence, please.

A,  It says, however, if we knew more about nicotine absorption, action, elimination, enhancement and the like, it should in theory be possible to.more precisely specify and deliver the optimum amounts of nicotine activity in sophisticated products, which would be more satisfying and desirable to the user.

Q.  Okay.  That's fine.

Does Dr. Teague use the word if in that

A.  Yes, he does.

Q.  Does he suggest that Reynolds needs to know more about nicotine and its effects on the body?

A.  Yes, he does.

Q.  Does Dr. Teague use the word theory in that sentence?

A.  He does. He says in theory.

Q.  Does this � does that sentence contain any citations to either external literature or internal Reynolds Tobacco research data?

A.  No, there are no data provided, no � no citations to the scientific literature, no references of any kind.

Q.  I want you to turn to page six. Trade with you for a second. Will you read the first � very first sen vSiics.

A.  The very first sentence says, but, again, the picture is not quite all that clear.     ^, .

Q.  Does Dr. say � Teague say that the picture is clear with respect to how nicotine effects individual smokers?

A.  No. He indicates the opposite.

Q.  If you'll turn to the bottom of that paragraph, there's a discussion about critics lumping tar and nicotine together.

Do you see that discussion in the next paragraph?

A.  In the next paragraph?

Q.  Yes.

A.  Yes.

Q.  I want you to read that paragraph to yourself and then I'm going to ask you a question.

A,  I've read it.

Q.  Will you explain what Dr. Teague is referring to with respect to lumping together tar and nicotine and perhaps that is not a proper approach for developing less hazardous cigarettes?

A.  Yes, this paragraph seems to be speaking of the fact that some individuals think of tar and nicotine together. And yet, while he hasn't cited to any literature, this paragraph seems to be addressing concepts put forward by Dr. Mike Russell some years before this document. These are ones that were suggesting that the risks associated with smoking could be reduced by maintaining nicotine yield, but reducing tar yield in relation to nicotine yield. This is the concept of the so-called Russell cigarette that you would have mid-level nicotine and low tar.

q        If yOU'n turn to page seven. Will you verify that there are a number of places where Dr. Teague uses the word if again.

A.  Yes, there are.

Q.  Xs there any reference after any of the sentence that uses the word if to citations to the external literature or to citations to internal Reynolds Tobacco research data?

A.  There are no citations at any point on the page to internal or external literature.

Q.  From your knowledge of the 1964 Surgeon General's report and other scientific literature that had considered the question of nicotine and smoking

Page 109 behavior, do you know whether the concepts of nicotine and its role with smoking behavior expressed in this memo were or were not publically disclosed before he wrote this internal document?

A.  It's my view that the concepts here would have been consistent with the 1964 Surgeon General's report. And that report was widely publicized.  It was a public report.

Q.  All right. New topic, Dr. Borgerding. You were asked some questions about the ingredients that are used in Reynolds' cigarettes. First of all, does Reynolds use added ingredients to all its cigarette brands?

A.  No, not all of Reynolds cigarette brands contain additives.

Q.  Has Reynolds disclosed to the Department of Health and Human Services of the federal government historically the ingredients used in its cigarettes?

A.  Yes, Reynolds has.

Q.  Do you know when that first happened?

A.  That first happened in 1986.  It was provided both to the Department of HHS and to the CDC.

Q.   Has Reynolds disclosed the ingredients that it uses in its cigarettes to the Food and Drug

A.  Yes, for the last several years Reynolds has provided that information to the FDA since tobacco products have been regulated by the FDA.

Q.  Does � has Reynolds had in place for decades a program to evaluate its cigarette ingredients used in its products?

A.  Reynolds has had a program to evaluate all materials that may be used in a cigarette. And each one has been evaluated to use the minimum amount necessary and to make sure that there's no increase in risk when such material is used.

Q.  Has the HHS or the FDA ever told Reynolds that it should remove any ingredients used in its cigarette brands because they create additional risk to smokers above the inherent risks of using tobacco products?

A.  No, they've never indicated any concern about any of the ingredients, nor, to my knowledge, have they replied to Congress with any concerns, even though they're required to review them and report to Congress if they do have concerns.

Q.  You mentioned that Reynolds has a section on its corporate website dealing with ingredients; is that true?

A.  That's true, yes.

Q.  Does that section on Reynolds' website contain lists by brand of ingredients used in Reynolds cigarettes?

A.  Yes, it contains both a listing of all the ingredients used in any of our cigarette brands, and it includes information on a brand style by brand style basis.

Q.  You were asked a question by Mr. Wichmann about whether the American Cancer Society has taken a public position that Eclipse should be removed from the market. Do you remember that question?

A.  I do, yes.

Q.  Have you ever seen a document that the American Cancer Society wrote where they took that position?

A.  No, I've not seen such a document.

Q.  Did Mr. Wichmann describe for you where you might go find such a document during his questioning?

A.  No, he didn't.

Q.  And did he show you a document written by the American Cancer Society that suggested Eclipse should be banned from the market?

A.  No, he showed � did not show me any documents in that regard.

Dr. Borgerding received a B5. degree in Biochemistry from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 1978, an MS. in Chemistry from Virginia Bolytecbnic Institute and State University in 1980, and a PhD. in Chemistry from Wake Forest University in 1988. In 1980, Dr. Borgerding joined the Research and Development Department of Reynolds as a Junior Research
pgNbr=138
Chemist. In 1982, Dr. Borgerding was promoted to Associate Research Chemist, Mowed by promotions to Rraearch Cfcaiist in 1984, Senior Research Chemist in 1987, hotter Otemist in 1991, Principal Scientist in 1998, and Senior Imncipal Scientist in 2001, In 2007, he became Senior Director of Product Evaluation in Reynolds' R&D, Attached as Exhibit A is a copy of Dr. Boarding's curriculum vhVie. In addition to his responsibilities at Reynolds, Dr. Borgerding has been an Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Dr. Borgerding has authored or co-auttiored more than 100 papers and presentations relating to cigarettes and cigarette smoke chemistry, the development and application of analytical methods for the investigation of tobacco smoke, mouth-level cigarette smoke exposure studies using yield-in-use rneasurernenl techniques, devdoprnent of tobacco and cigarette smoke testing for regulatory purposes, and other cigarette product evaluation studies. He has also served as a peer reviewer for scientific journals, including Analytical Chemistry, %mte$8�m$m.> and the Journal of arromfltoeraphic Science. He has made scientific presentations to the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Texas Department of Health, Hearth Canada, the FTC, ISO, and the Provincial Government of British Columbia.

reject PfWrvT vIPx^Tetti^RY Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with high quality scientific staff, engineers and technical personnel. Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the research and development of cigarettes. Reynolds* scientists have been recognized for their expertise in identifying smoke constituents, quantifying yields of cigarette smoke constituents, reducing smoke constituent yields, and commercializing cigarettes with the potential to reduce
pgNbr=139
the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds* historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has earnestly responded to smoking and health concerns through the design and modificfluorj of its products based upon the extensive research conducted in Reynolds' laboratories. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking, diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields, and substantially added to the scientific literature via its own scientific research. He will testify about Reynolds' R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. He will testify about Reynolds' efforts to identify, develop, and implement cigarette designs that substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized maclunc-smoking methods, mouth-level exposure measures, and studies of biomarkers. Dr. Borgerorng will testify that Reynolds has developed successful cigarette designs and technologies that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of thousands of individual chemical constituents. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds identified by various governmental and public health entities as known, probable, or possible carcinogens by the US, EPA, IARC, or the US. National Toxicology Program.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that, despite considerable technical obstacles, Reynolds has worked to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify about criteria for new tobacco product development, including ensuring that products do not introduce unintended consequences, finished products are
pgNbr=140
consumer acceptable, technologies are feasible from a regulatory standpoint, and technologies are feasible from a rnauufacturlng standpoint. He will testify that over the years many market introductions by Reynolds and other cigarette manufacturers have achieved technical success in reducing smoke constituents but have failed to achieve widespread consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such products, including wrbon-filtercd dgarettes, "denlcotioizedH cigarettes, ultra-low yielding cigarettes, and tobacco-heating cigarettes.

Dr. fiorgerding may testify about cigarette test methods, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FrC) method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Fad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial agarettes. It is Dr. Borgeiding's opinion that Reynolds has not designed its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC or any other cigarette test method. Dr. Borgerding will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and that the scientific and public health communities widely recognize that a broad range of smoking behaviors influence smoke yield and intake. He will testify that despite these variations, smokers of lower machine yield cigarettes, on average, receive less smoke than smokers of higher rnachine yield cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds' efforts to reduce "tax" and nicotine yields were a key guiding principle in the development and execution of its product designs and product technologies over the course of many decades.
pgNbr=141
Dr. Borgerdmg will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: (1) general reduction and (2) selective reduction. In discussing general reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about the cigarette design techniques Reynolds has used to achieve smoke yield reductions, including; filtration; filter ventilation; high/increased porosity dgarette paper(s); dgarette paper bum promoters; expanded tobaccos; reconstituted tobaccos; reduced tobacco weight; dgarette rod length reduction; reduced cigarette density; and reduced rod circumference. He will testify that, at all times, Reynolds* cigarettes conformed to the generally recognized state-of-the-art in dgarette design and manufacture and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at given standardized machine generated "tar" and dcotine yields. SJr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies that are in use in the marketplace today. He will testify about the incorporation of general reduction technologies over time in specific Reynolds dgarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has modified its products in response to consumer demand for lower "tar"* products and government and public health authority recommendations for reducing "tar" and nicotine yields as a means of reducing the risks of dgarette smoking. He will testify that the general reductioa techniques used by Reynolds have substantially lowered machine-measured "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing low "tar" and/or ultra low 'tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Borgerding will also testify that general reduction techniques effectively reduce the yields of the
pgNbr=142
majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related to smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns and reduce the risks of cigarette smoking.

In discussing selective reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' work in identifying and quantifying the toxicants of interest, developing technologies to accomplish specific toxicant reductions, and developing products that are commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will testify that Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' development of innovative cigarette designs, including tobacco heating products such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also testify about innovations in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique. Dr. Borgerding may also testify regarding the products sold by related corporations, including electronic cigarettes (Vuse) and nicotine replacement therapy (Zonule).

Dr. Borgerding may testify about Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments on the development and evaluation of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no VS. governmental authority has ever recommended, mandated, acknowledged, or identified any alternative cigarette design to reduce the risks associated with cigarette smoking. In all effort to potentially reduce the risks of smoking, the European Union requires all cigarette designs to yield no more than 10 mg "tar,** 1 mg nicotine, and 10 mg CO, according to standard test procedures. Reynolds was a leader in technologies to develop cigarettes to achieve these mandated levels.
pgNbr=143
His testimony will describe Reynolds' product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Borgerding will also testify about studies in smokers sponsored by Reynolds, includi tig yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients used in its cigarettes (website, governmental reporting, and publications) and stewardship of ingredients.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about allegations of nicotine manipulation through altered cigarette design. He will testify that Reynolds has not altered pH or the amount of Tree" nicotine or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will testify that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase "free nicotine/' does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using machine methods.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' corporate positions on smoking and health issues and statements about smoking and health issues on its website.

Dr. Borgerding will testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding Reynolds' cigarette research and design efforts. He will offer testimony in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits, and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Borgerding reserves the right to amend this disclosure,

Fees

Transforming Tobacco

Guiding Principles and Beliefs

Balancing the Desires of our Stakeholders

At R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company we operate our business In a responsible manner that best balances the desires of our many stakeholders. Our Guiding.Principles and Beliefs seek to reflect the interests of shareholders, adutt tobacco consumers, employees and other.stakehoWers. In particular, R.J. Reynolds is committed to addressing the issues regarding the use of and harm assodated with tobacco products in an open and objective manner.

Tobacco Use & Health

�   Cigarette smoking Is a leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States. Cigarette smoking significantly increases the risk of developing king cancer/ heart disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and other serious diseases and adverse health conditions.

�   The risk for serious diseases is significantly affected by the type of tobacco product and the frequency, duration and manner of use.

�   No tobacco product has been shown to be safe and without risks. The health risks associated with cigarettes are significantly greater than those associated with the use of smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products.

� Nicotine In tobacco products Is addictive but Is not considered a significant threat to health.

�   It is the smoke Inhaled from burning tobacco which poses the most significant risk of serious diseases.

�   Quitting cigarette smoking significantly reduces the risk for serious diseases.

�   Adult tobacco consumers have a right to be fully and accurately Informed about the risks of serious diseases, the significant differences In the comparative risks of different tobacco and nicotine-based products, and the benefits of quitting. This information should be based on sound science.

�   Governments, public health officials, tobacco manufacturers and others sham a responsibility to provide adult tobacco consumers with accurate information about the various health risks and comparative risks assodated with the use of different tobacco and nicotine products.

Tobacco Regulation & Communication

�  Tobacco products should be regulated In a manner that is designed to achieve significant and measurable reductions In the risks and adverse health effects associated with tobacco use. Regulations should enhance the information available to adult tobacco consumers to permit them to make informed choices, and encourage the development of tobacco and nicotine products with lower risks than existing cigarettes.

�  The degree of regulation should be based on the risks and comparative risks of tobacco and nicotine products and their respective product categories. Preferential treatment (taxation, marketing, consumer communication, labeling, etc.) should be given to tobacco and nicotine products or product categories that are less harmful than cigarettes.

�   Communication and Interaction with adult tobacco consumers regarding their brand choices Is essential for effective competition.

m Public policy should allow communication of the comparative risks of tobacco products and

RJ, KiynoWi Tobuco Company I GaUlr* Principle* a lelfcfe

encourage to bacco consumers to either quit or switch to lower-risk products.

�   The regulation of marketing of tobacco products should be consistent with constitutional protections and enhance an adult tobacco consumer's ability to make an Informed choice by providing accurate Information on the risks and comparative risks of tobacco products.

�   The marketing of tobacco products should not be targeted to minors and non-tobacco consumers.

�   The prohibition of tobacco products Is neither practical nor desirable.

Tobacco Consumers

�   Individuals should consider the conclusions of the U.S. Surgeon General, the Centers for Disease Control and other public health and medical officials when making decisions regarding smoking.

�  The best course of action for tobacco consumers concerned about their health Is to quit. Adults who continue to use tobacco products should consider the reductions of risks for serious diseases associated with moving from cigarettes to the use of smoke-free tobacco or nicotine products.

�   Minors should never use tobacco products and adults who do not use or have quit using tobacco products should not start

�   Adults who smoke should avoid exposing minors to secondhand smoke, and adult smokers should comply with rules and regulations designed to respect the rights of cither adults.

Harm Reduction

� Reducing the diseases and deaths associated with the use of cigarettes serves public health goals and is In the best interest of consumers, manufacturers and society. Harm reduction should be the critical element of any comprehensive public policy surrounding the health consequences of tobacco use.

�   significant reductions in the harm associated with the use of cigarettes can be achieved by providing accurate trtmnrtation regarding the comparative risks of tobacco products to adult tobacco consumers, thereby encouraging smokers to migrate to the use of smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products, and by developing new smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products and other actions.

�   Governments, public health officials, manufacturers, tobacco producers and consumers should support the development, production, and commercial Introduction of tobacco leaf, and tobacco and nicotine-based products that are scientifically shown to reduce the risks associated with the use of existing tobacco products, particularly cigarettes.

�   Adult tobacco consumers should have access to a range of commercially viable tobacco and nicotine-based products.

Nicotine Addiction

Most smokers are dependent on nicotine.

Smokeless tobacco use can also lead to nicotine dependence.

Nicotine dependence is the most common form of chemical dependence in the United States.

Research suggests that nicotine is as addictive as heroin, cocaine, or alcohol.

Examples of nicotine withdrawal symptoms mdude irritability, anxiety, difficulty concentrating, insomnia, restlessness, and increased appetite.

Quitting tobacco use is difficult and may require multiple attempts.

FDA-approved medications that can reduce the withdrawal symptoms that may occur with a quit attempt are available; for more information, call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or speak with your healthcare provider.

HEMOttANDOH:

In a sense, the tobacco Industry amy be thought of as being a specialized,

highly ritualized and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry.  Tobacco

products, uniquely, contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug with a variety  4

of physiological effects.  Related alkaloids, and probably other compounds,

with desired physiological effects are also present 1n tobacco and/or Its smoke..

Nicotine 1s known to be a habit-forming alkaloid, hence the confirmed user of

.tobacco products H primarily seeding the physiological "satisfaction11 derived

from nicotine � and perhaps other active compounds.  His choice of product .

and pattern of usage are primarily deterndned by his individual nicotine

dosage requirements and secondarily by a variety of other considerations

Including flavor and Irritancy of the product, social patterns and needs,

physical and manipulative gratifications, convenience, cost, health considerations

and the like.  Thus a tobacco product 1s, in essence, a vehicle for delivery of

nicotine, designed to deliver the nicotine in a generally acceptable and

* -'   �     ;" �--'�-* attractive form.  Our Industry is then based upon design, manufacture and sale i

of attractive dosage forms of nicotine, and our Company's position In our        1

Industry is determined by our ability to produce dosage forms of nicotine which j

have more overall value, tangible or Intangible, to the consumer thin those     - j

of our competitors,                                                                                                                      t

The habituated user of tobacco products 1s said to derive "satisfaction" from nicotine.  Although much studied, the physiological actions of nicotine       < are still poorly understood and appear to be many and varied.   For example. In different situations and at different dose levels, nicotine appears to act as

a   stimulant, depressant, tranquilizer, psychic entrglzer, appetite reducer,    s                    93

ent1 -fatigue agent, or energizer, to fiamt but a few of the varied and often      v                     J^J

contradictory effects attributed to It.  Many of these sire effects ivy be

achieved with other physiologically active materials such as caffeine; alcohol, tranquUizersy sedatives, euphorlcs, and the like.   Therefore, 1n addition to ccepetlng with products of the tobacco Industry, our products �ay, In a sense. ccMpcte with a variety of other products with certain types of drug action.  All of these products, tobacco and other, appear to have certain canon attributes In that they are used largely to relieve, In one way or another, the fatigues and stresses which arise 1n the course of existence In a complex society*

Happily for the tobacco Industry, nicotine 1$ both habituating and unique in Its variety of physiological actions, hence no other active listeria! or conblnatlon of materials provides equivalent HitlsfactlorT.  Whether  -nicotine will, over the long term, sain tain its unique position is subject to some reasonable doubt.  With Increasef^PriTstlcttlon of knowledge In the biological and pharmaceutical areas, a superior or at least equivalent product or product mixture may emerge.   For this reason, It would be i mistake to assume that the tobacco Industry, as we now know 1t, 1s Imnortal or that no direct conpqtHlon from organizations outside of the tobacco Industry trill ever occur.   It Is safe to assure, however, that nicotine will retain its unique position throughout the present ten year planning period, and probably for a tajch longer span of time.

If nicotine 1s the sj^cjua r*nof tobacco products and tobacco products

9

are recognized as being attractive dosage forms of nicotine, then it Is     | logical to design our products ~� and where possible, our advertising � around nicotine delivery rather than "tar* delivery or flavor. To do this we need to S
pgNbr=181

develop new data on such things as the physiological effects of nicotine, the rate of absorption and elimination of nicotine delivered In different doses at different frequencies end by different routes.*and ways of enhancing or diminishing nicotine effects and "satisfactions"*  In the absence of such data, we nay survey the market and conclude that current cigarette     r� products delivering about 1.3 org. of nicotine appear to "satisfy" the typical smoker.   This, somewhat crudely, establishes a target dosage level for design of new products.   An acco^nylng-lmseaixh Planning Proposal describes that -   approach In some detail,  however, jf we knew more about nicotine absorption, action, elimination.' e^aneement and the like", It should,"In theory, be possible to nore precisely specify, and deliver, the optlnum amounts of nicotine activity 1n sophisticated products which would be more satisfying and desirable to the user.   This area Merits consideration and activity.

Before proceeding too far 1n the direction of design of dosage form for nicotine, it may he well to consider another aspect of our business; that Is, the factors which induct a pre-smoker or nca-snoker to become a habituated seeker.   Paridoxlcally, the things which keep a confirmed smoker habituated and "satisfied", i.e., nicotine and secondary physical and manipulative gratiffcations, are unknown andVor largely unexplained to the iKHi-snofcer.   He does not start stoking to obtain undefined physiological gratifications or reliefs, and certainly he does not start to siaoke to satisfy a non-existent craving for nicotine.   Rather, he appears to start to smoke for purely psychological reason* � to emulate a valued Image., to conform, to experiment,   9 to defy, to be daring, to have something to do with his hands, and the Hkt.     � )               Only after experiencing smoking for some period of time do the physiological      �                 tn

"satisfactions" and habituation become apparent and nitded.   Indeed, the first �                 |^

stoking experiences ere often unpleasant until � tolertnce for nicotine his been developed.  This learn us, then, in the position or attempting to design and promote the sate product to two different types of market with two different sett of motivations, needs and expectations.  The sate situation 1s encountered in tote Industries, but the problem Is usually not as severe.

If what we have said about the habituated stoker Is true, then products designed for Mm should etpbaslie nicotine, nicotine delivery efficiency, nicotine satisfaction, and the like,  what we should really make and sell would be the proper dosage form of nicotine with as many other built-in attractions and gratifications as possible -� that 1$, en efficient nicotine delivery system with satisfactory flavor, mildness, convenience, cost, etc. On the other hand, if we are to attract the non-samker or pre-samker, there Is nothing 1n this type of product that he would currently understand or desire.   We have deliberately played down the role of nicotine, hence the non*saoker has little or no knowledge of what satisfactions It may offer him, and no desire to try It.   Instead, we sowehow nust convince Mm with wholly Irrational reasons that he should try smoking, In the hope that he will for himself then discover the real "satisfactions" obtainable.   And, of course, In the present advertising climate, our opportunities to talk to the pre-sitokar ere Increasingly limited, and therefore,Increasingly ineffective. Would It not bo better, In the long run, to Identify In our own minds end In the minds of our customers what we are really selling, i.e., nicotine satisfaction? This would enable us to speak directly of the virtues of our product to the    � confirmed smoker, and would educate the pre-smoker, perhaps indirectly but     f effectively, 1n what we have to offer and what It would bo expected to do      g for Mm.                                                                                                                      *

hut again, the picture is not quite ill that clean  Critics of tobacco products increasingly allege that smoking Is dangerous to the health of the smoker.  Part of this alleged danger is claimed to arise from ingestion of nicotine and part is claimed to arise from smoke components or smoke "tar",   if, as proposed above, nicotine it the sjine ou* npn of smoking, and If we meekly accept the allegations of our critics and move toward reduction or elimination of nicotine from our products, then we shall eventually liquidate our business.   If we intend to remain in business and our business Is '   the manufacture end sale of dosage forms of nicotine, then at seme point we must make a stand,  we should know more, rather than less, than our critics about the physiological effects of nicotine, and we should in all ways scientifically validate and speak to the beneficial effects and "satisfactions" derived from use of nicotine.   Essentially all commercial drugs give rise to some undesirable side effects, but we continue to ate them with great benefit to humanity because of their overriding beneficial effects.   Might we not take a leaf from that book in our approach to nicotine?  unless we do, our long-term prospects become unattractive.

Our critics have luiped "tar* and nicotine together in-their allegations

about health hazards, perhaps because "tar" and nicotine ere generated together

1n varying proportions when tobacco is smoked.   An acconoanyfng Research

Planning Memorandum suggests an approach to'reducing the amount of "tar" U

cigarette smoke per unit of nicotine.   That is probably the most realistic

approach 1n today's market for conventional cigarette products*  However,

m

another more futuristic approach is possible which goes more directly to the    |                 ai

If our business Is fundamentally that of supplying nicotine In useful dosage form. Why 1s It really necessary that allegedly harmful "tar* accoaswry that nicotff*?  There should be tone simpler, "cltantr*, wore efficient and direct way to provide the desired nicotine dosage than the present system involving ccobustion of tobacco or even chewing of tobacco; A conventional 1000 eg. tobacco rod containing about 20 mg. of nicotine Is sacked to produce only about 1.3 eg of stoke nicotine, accosmanfed by about 20 eg. of "tar" and 20 mg. of gas phase natter; and a-sabtitvitiul part of the 1.3 mg of smoke nicotine Is lost to the sicker via exhaled smoke � surely an Inefficient nicotine delivery system.   It should be possible to obtain pure nicotine by synthesis or front high-nicotine tobacco.   It should then be possible, using modifications of techniques developed by the pharmaceutical and other Industries, to deliver that nicotine to the user 1n efficient, effective, attractive dosage dorm, accospanltd by no "tar", gas phase, or other allegedly harmful substances.   The ctosage fore could Incorporate various flavorants, enhancers, and like desirable additives, and would be designed to deliver the minimum effective amount of nicotine at the desired release-rate to supply the "satisfaction*' desired try the user.  Such a product would maximize the benefits derived from nicotine, minimize allegedly undesirable over-dosage side effects from nicotine', and eliminate exposure to other matef fals alleged to be harvtfvl to the user.  For the long term, we should be working toward develrswnt of such products -- If we do not, inevitably someone else will, and there art strong ligations that others arm already awing In this direction.

In the present real situation, where nothing has been done to counteract the adverse allegations about nicotine and where conventional products delivering adequate amounts of nicotine dominate the Mrketplace, no abrupt change In our posture or strategy would be appropriate or reasonable. The approaches advocated above art alined at stopping and eventually reversing a trend that nay in the long tent put us out of business, and are intended to lay a framework of philosophy around which research efforts nay now begin. Hopefully, suae day we will rejoice rather than despair when a new crop of tobacco shows an unusually high content of nicotine, our priitary product. Hopefully, with tine we will be able to develop sophisticated and leproved �Inlaw dosage fores for nicotine which will be tore satisfying to the user and free of alleged health hazards.  And hopefully, by that tine, we will have been able to establish and use Information shoving that use of nicotine fills real, demonstrable huton needs, the beneficial effects overriding the allegedly hemful side effects.

If the above Is a valid line of reasoning, then our long-tern future courses of action should be as follow:

1.    Recognize the key role of nicotine in consumer satisfaction, and design and promote our products with this 1n aditd.

2.    More precisely define the minimum amount of nicotine required for

CASE NO.:   2013^A-005673 NC Division T COUNTY:    Sarasota

GEORGE J. DION as Personal Represemative Of the Estate of Marion T. Dion, deceased,

PlaintifT, vs. RJ. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY, et at,

Defendant

THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT

Plaintiff, GEORGE J. DION, Personal Representative of the ESTATE OF MARION T. DION sues Defendant, RJ. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY, and alleges as follows:

1.        PlaintifT is a member of the class of persons described by the Supreme Court of Florida in Engle v. Uggetl Group, Inc., 945 So.2d 1246 (Fla. 2006) ("Engle"). PlaintifT brings this action pursuant to Engle.

2.        PlaintifT George J. Dion is die Personal Representative of the Estate of Marion T. Dion, Marion T. Dion left one "survivor*' within the meaning of Florida's Wrongful Death Act, her spouse George J. Dion,

3.        The Decedent Marion T. Dion, is referred to as the "Decedent** or the "Smoker."

4.        Defendant RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company, individually and as successor by merger to Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, individually and as successor by merger to The American Tobacco Company, is a North Carolina corporation that conducts

1


pgNbr=189
business in the State of Florida, including Sarasota County, and did so during all times relevant to this action.

5.          The Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A., Inc. (the "Council") and the Tobacco Institute. Inc. (the "Institute"), at alt times relevant to this action, were involved in promotion, lobbying, medical research, legislative and political activities or related ventures throughout Florida and the United States both In connection with and on behalf of the Defendant.

6.          At ail times relevant to this action, the Defendant manufactured and distributed tobacco products containing nicotine throughout Florida and the United Slates. The Defendant, was and remains and Engle defendant.

7.          In Bnglet the Florida Supreme Court approved certification for liability purposes of a class including all Florida citizens and residents, and their survivors, who have suffered, presently suffer, or wbo have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine.

8.          At all times relevant to this action, the Smoker was a Florida resident and citizen (1) who was addicted to, purchased, and smoked cigarettes containing nicotine that were designed, manufactured, advertised and marketed by the Defendant and (2) who did so In sufficient Quantities and for a sufncient time period to cause injury in the form of diseases and medical conditions described herein. The brands smoked included but are not limited to Chesterfield, L & M, Marlboro, Benson & Hedges, Winston, Carlton, Doral and Kent.

9.          The Florida Supreme Court decertified the Engle class because class-wide treatment of causation and damages was not feasible. The Florida Supreme Court expressly reserved to class members, including Plamtiff, the right to bring individual actions against Defendants tor smoking-relaied injuries and damages, including punitive damages.

2
pgNbr=190
10.        Less than one year has elapsed since the Florida Supreme Court's mandate issued. Therefore, this action is timely, and the filing of this Amended Complaint relates back to the date of filing of the original Complaint.

11.        Because Plaintiff was an Engle class member, Plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of the Phase I findings and Plaintiff asserts and alleges those findings as conclusively established in this action as follows:

11 Smoking cigarettes causes aortic aneurysm, bladder cancer, cerebrovascular disease, cervical cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease, esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, laryngeal cancer, lung cancer, (specifically, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma), complications of pregnancy, orat cavityAongue cancer, pancreatic cancer, peripheral vascular disease, pharyngeal cancer, and stomach cancer.

13.       Nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.

14.       Defendant placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous.

15.        Defendant concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available, knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a materia) fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or both.

16.        Defendant agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers and the public would rely on this information to their detriment.

17.       Defendant sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective.

18.       Defendant sold or supplied cigarettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to representations of fact made by Defendants.

19.        Defendant was negligent.

3
pgNbr=191
20,        As a direct and proximate result of smoking cigarettes manufactured and sold by Defendant, the Smoker suffered from and died due to one or more of the diseases and medical conditions described, including lung cancer, stroke, and COPD, which was caused by her addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine and each of which manifested during the class period,

21.       The Smoker may bear some measure of fault, but in all events less than 100% of the applicable fault, for causing her respective srnoking-related injuries. The Smoker's acts or omissions relating to the frequency and duration of her efforts to quit smoking may have been a partial proximate cause, in combination with the acts and omissions of Defendant, of her injuries. In the event that the jury in the trial of this action concludes that the Smoker bears some portion of the applicable fault, Plaintiff seeks apportionment of fault and damages, as to the non-intentional tort claims sounding in strict liability (Count I) and negligence (Count IV). No such apportionment is sought under any circumstances for the intentional tort claims, concealment and conspiracy to conceal; and no such apportionment is sought with respect to any recovery or entitlement to punitive damages. Plaintiff expressly pleads and requests the application of section 768.81 (4), Florida Statutes, which provides that comparative fault principles do not apply to any action based on intentional tort. Because concealment and conspiracy to conceal are intentional torts, the law does not allow for the reduction of Plaintiff s damages if he prevails on either or both of these claims.

22.       Venue is proper in this Circuit because Defendant has agents or other representatives in this Circuit

Yes I do. But, addiction is a medical diagnosis. I'm not qualified to say whether the smoker was addicted or not Vm not sure what the smoker's medical records say about this. Defendants have been given medical records releases to obtain those records. Doctors will have to say whether toe smoker was addicted. Since I can't say whether the smoker was addicted or not I cant say how long the smoker was addicted. The witnesses who may be able to testify about the smoker's addiction are her doctors and/or expert witnesses who have not been identified yet.

Subject Matter of Expert Testimony

Dr. Borgcrding will testify that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with high quality scientific staff, engineers and technical personnel. Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the research and development of cigarettes. Reynolds* scientists have been recognized for their expertise in identifying smoke constituents, quantifying yields of cigarette smoke constituents, reducing smoke constituent yields, and commercializing cigarettes with the potential to reduce
pgNbr=219
the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' historic and current work In harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has earnestly responded to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products based upon the extensive research conducted in Reynolds" laboratories. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking, diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields, and substantially added to the scientific literature via its own scientific research. He will testify about Reynolds* R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. He will testify about Reynolds' efforts to identify, develop, and implement cigarette designs that substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine-smoking methods, mouth-level exposure measures, and studies of bioniarkcrs. Dr. Borgerding will testify thSf Reynolds has developed successful cigarette designs and technologies that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of thousands of individual chemical constituents. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds identified by various governmental and public health entities as known, probable, or possible carcinogens by the U.S. EPA, 1ARC, or the U.S. National Toxicology Program.

Dr. Borgcitting will testify that, despite considerable technical obstacles, Reynolds has worked to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify about criteria for new tobacco product development, including ensuring that pruducls do not introduce unintended consequences, Finished products arc
pgNbr=220
consumer acceptable, technologies arc feasible from a regulatory slandnoinl, and technologies arc feasible from a manufacturing standpoint. He will testify that over the years many market introductions by Reynolds and other cigarette manufacturers have achieved technical success in reducing smoke constituents but have failed to achieve widespread consumer acceptance, He will point to examples of such products, including carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotinized" cigarettes, ultra-low yielding cigarettes, and tobacco-heating cigarettes.

Dr. fhjrg�dingcnay testify about cigarette lest methods, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC) method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes, It is Dr. Borgerding's opinion (hat Reynolds has not designed its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC or any other cigarette test method. Dr. Borgerding will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and mat the scientific and public heallh commumlies widely recognize that a broad range of smoking behaviors influence smoke yield and intake. He will testify that despite these variations, smokers of lower machine yield cigarettes, on average, receive less smoke than smokers of higher machine yield cigarettes.

I>r. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds' efforts to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields were a key guiding principle in the development and execution of its product designs and product technologies over the course of many decades.
pgNbr=221
Dr. BOTgerding will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: (1) general reduction and (2) selective reduction. In discussing general reduction. Dr. Borgerding will testify about the cigarette design techniques Reynolds has used to achieve smoke yield reductions, including, filtration; filter ventilation; high/increased porosity cigarette papcr(s); cigarette paper burn promoters; expanded tobaccos; reconstituted tobaccos; reduced tobacco weight; cigarette rod length reduction; reduced cigarette density; and reduced rod circumference. He will testify that, at all times, Reynolds' cigarettes conformed to the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacture and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at given standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields. Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies thai are in use in the rriarketplace today. He will testily about the incorporation of general reduction technologies over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has modified its products in response to consumer demand for lower "tar*" products and government and public health authority recormnendations for reducing "tar" and nicotine yields as a means of reducing the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify that the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds have substantially lowered machine-measured "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into comntercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing low "tar" and/or ultra low "tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Borgerding will also testify that general reduction techniques effectively reduce the yields of the
pgNbr=222
majorily of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related to smoking and health issues. He will teslify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns and reduce the risks of cigarette smoking.

In discussing selective reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' work in identifying and quantifying the toxicants of interest, developing technologies to accomplish specific toxicant reductions, and developing products that arc commercially feasible as welt as consumer acceptable, He will testify that Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years. Dr, Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' development of innovative cigarette designs, including tobacco heating products such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also testify about innovations in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique. Dr. Borgerding may also testify regarding the products sold hy related corporations, including electronic cigarettes (Vuse) and nicotine replacement therapy (Zonnic).

Dr. Borgerding may teslify about Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments on the development and evaluation of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no U.S. governmental authority has ever recommended, mandated, acknowledged, or identified any alternative cigarette design to reduce the risks associated with cigarette smoking. In an effort to potentially reduce the risks of smoking, the European Union requires all cigarette designs to yield no more than 10 mg "tar," t mg nicotine, and 10 mg CO, according to standard lest procedures. Reynolds was a leader in technologies to develop cigarettes to achieve these mandated levels.
pgNbr=223
His testimony will describe Reynolds' product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Borgcrding will also testify about studies in smokers sponsored by Reynolds, including yietd-in-use and biornarker studies,

He will testify (hat Reynolds docs not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. lie will discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients used in its cigarettes (website, governmental reporting, and publications) and stewardship of ingredients.

Dr. Borgcrding may testify about allegations of nicotine manipulation through altered cigarette design. He will testify that Reynolds has not altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will testify that research has shown that (he use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase "free nicotine," docs not increase nicotine transfer rates, and docs not influence the measuremeot of smoke nicotine using machine methods.

Dr. B orgeiding will testify about Reynolds' corporate positions on smoking and health issues and statements about smoking and health issues on its website.

Dr. Borgerding will testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding Reynolds' cigarette research and design efforts. He will offer testimony in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits, and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Borgcrding reserves the right to amend this disclosure.

Fees

Dr. Borgerding docs not charge a foe for deposition or trial testimony and receives no additional compensation for his time spent as an expert witness in litigation. He has spent approximately five percent of bis lime or less serving as an expert witness in litigation during the past five years.
