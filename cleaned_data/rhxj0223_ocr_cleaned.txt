THE WITNESS:  Thank you very much.  I appreciate it.

(Pause.)

THE COURT:  Is the plaintiff ready to proceed?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Plaintiff is ready to proceed.  I believe the defendant, having reviewed our slide deck, have two objections, and I don't know that we'11 get to them before lunch but I don't know that we won't, Judge.  I think we will not.  I'm confident we will not, but --

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, we're going to have the midmorning break before lunch because we haven't had that yet, so we'll do it at that time.

MR. GERAGHTY:  That's fine.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  We're going to go ahead and bring in the jury.

(The jury entered the courtroom at 9:38 a.m.)

THE COURT DEPUTY:  Jury is in the box. K. MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D., MPH, called as a witness by the Plaintiff, was duly sworn by the Clerk of the Court, and in answer to questions propounded, testified as follows:

DIRECT EXAMINATION THE COURT:  Mr. Schultz. MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Your Honor. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, good morning.  Could you introduce yourself to the jury, please.

A.   Sure.  I'm Kenneth Michael Cummings, and I'm a professor in the department of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, South Carolina.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, we have a slide on the topics covered this morning including Lamar Danielson's addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine; Philip Morris' marketing of Marlboro cigarettes; and the defendant's concealment and false health controversy, including what Philip Morris and its coconspirators knew from 1953 to 1999 and what they concealed, what they said publicly and through their ads, how it relates to Mr. Danielson's addiction, why it matters in this case. Does that fairly summarize the opinions you'll be giving in court?

A.   It does.

Q.   And can you tell the jury a little bit about yourself in terms of your current work?

A.   Sure.  As I said, I'm a professor in the School of Medicine in the department of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina.  I also co-lead their tobacco research program as part of the Hollings Cancer Center.  I've been at the medical university since October of 2011.  Before that I spent 31 years at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York.

I oversee the tobacco cessation research and treatment programs at the university.  So we have a hospital-based service that I have put into place. Every patient that comes into our hospital is screened for their tobacco use.  If they're a tobacco user, we have a bedside counselor who will, you know, go meet with the patient, and then we follow the patients after they are discharged.

We have similar programs that we put in place for the emergency department, our dental school, and now we're sort of expanding into our outpatient clinic.  So every patient that comes to our institution will, you know, as a standard of care, get treated for their tobacco use.

Q.   And you mentioned, Dr. Cummings, that you had a previous position.  I don't know if you mentioned Roswell by name, but can you tell the jury before you came to the Medical University of South Carolina what

you did for a number of decades, I suppose, before that. A.   Yeah.  Three decades, 31 years at Roswell Park. I started there as a junior scientist and sort of rose up the ranks, became chairman of their department of health behavior.  You know, Roswell Park is a comprehensive cancer center.  It only takes care of cancer patients.  It does research, so it's designated as a comprehensive center by the National Cancer Institute as a center of excellence because of its research as well as treatment for cancer.

I sort of ran the prevention program as I, you know, got in the later stages of my career there and, you know, ran their cessation programs.  I created them, actually, in the early '80s.  When I arrived at Roswell, I started running clinics for smokers.  It sort of got me interested in the topic, and a lot of my research stemmed from trying to understand why smokers have a hard time quitting, why people start smoking, a whole array of factors related to tobacco use, which I think it will be reflected in the testimony that I'm going to give here today.

So -- and I created the New York State Smokers Quitline, which is -- many states now have toll-free numbers that people can call.  New York's was one of the first and one of the -- it's probably the largest in the

country still today.  I created that, ran it for 11 years.  We had over a million smokers call that line. The clinics that I ran personally face to face had over 10,000 smokers that I would deal with, you know, in group settings for the most part.  And we ran those at the hospital and community education centers, workplaces, prisons, anywhere that we could get a group of smokers together that wanted to quit.

Q.   And you mentioned teaching specifically, Dr. Cummings.  Did you teach medical students and medical doctors in the areas of nicotine addiction and the subjects you'll be talking about today with the jury?

A.   Yes.  You know, my training and background is in public health, health education and health behavior, and I've been involved in teaching courses in cancer epidemiology for -- well, when I was at Roswell Park for 25 years, I taught our graduate students, masters and Ph.D., as well as a number of medical students who were doing a MPH-MD while they were, you know, going to medical school.  And I continued to do that at the Medical University of South Carolina.

Q.   And does this summarize sort of what you've just been talking about, working in public health for 35-plus years, cancer prevention specifically for 33,

tobacco studies and treatment for 33, and also as a custodian of formerly secret tobacco documents for 13 or more years?

A.   Yeah, I didn't talk about the documents.  The documents -- a large share of the industry documents ended up getting turned over to New York State.

And so because I had developed a reputation as very successful in my research in New York, the attorney general in New York turned over, you know -- the documents got turned over from the Tobacco Institute and another organization called the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, later renamed the Council for Tobacco Research.  Both those organizations were incorporated originally in New York.

And in an agreement between state attorney generals and the tobacco industry, the documents were turned over to New York State, the archives, and the attorney general contacted me and asked me if Roswell Park wanted to receive those documents.  I agreed. Didn't know what I was getting into.  But 16,000 pages later, I received, you know, literally moving van versions of trucks arriving every two weeks depositing documents.

I was very fortunate to get grant funding.  I learned a lot about library science, because we hired

some really good people in how to digitize documents. Computer science at that time had to do optical scan recognition, which is sort of -- you know, today is a way of searching things online, but back then it was really just developing.

And we put that together, scanned all the material.  I created an archive, a lot of the index that's used for searching all of the industry documents -- there are about 80 million pages now available -- and we turned our collection -- the collections that I created over to the University of California, San Francisco where they're housed today.

Q.   And you mentioned 16,000 pages earlier in your testimony?  Was it --

A.   16 million, I'm sorry.

Q.   All right.

A.   Yeah.  It was a large -- about -- because I remember you could see the basement of Roswell Park.  We sort of took it over.

And this is, you know, the documents would come in every two weeks on moving vans, on big pallets like this.  Well organized, because they took the files out -- of course, there were big copies, and we sent some of our people down to the industry processing center where they were preparing the documents to be

sent to us.

But it also included audio and videotapes as well.  So there were -- the Tobacco Institute was the spokesperson for the industry, funded by the industry. Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, and all the companies contributed resources to it.

And those materials -- if there's any public statement was made, they tended to have a copy.  So I now have a historical copy of what they were saying both internally, inside, in terms of what they were saying to themselves in their documents versus what they were telling the public.

Q.   And -- will many of the documents, Dr. Cummings, that we see in this trial come out of this archive that you got from the State Attorney General?

A.   Yes.  Some will come from this archive, as well as the archives from each of the companies.  They also agreed to put their documents in a repository up in Minnesota, and later that was digitized.  So each company had a -- a Web site.

Their Web sites were not very searchable.  They were not very friendly to be searched.  They all had different patterns or criteria for how you did searching.  We, you know -- it wasn't my technology.  I had somebody who was very smart and figured out how to

spider the documents off of the individual companies. We created an index so you could go search across all the company records and then, you know, begin to look at things about, you know, cigarette design, marketing, and what they knew, when they knew it.

And as I said, there are about 80 million pages of material and -- and are -- obviously, I can't read 80 million pages of stuff, but it's like going to a library.  You can go to a card catalogue that will identify under categories.

And that's what we've done.  And -- and people are still doing research on the document archives -- I am -- as -- as we speak.  I mean, it's a -- it's a valuable source of information on, you know, a lot of topics related to tobacco.

Q.   I don't know if you mentioned it.  What year did you first get your first delivery of documents from the Tobacco Institute?

A.   Well, the -- the agreement occurred in 1998.  I think around late 1999, early 2000.

Q.   Okay.  And you read the -- the evidence, as we'll talk about in this case, on Lamar Danielson, correct?

of this occur after Lamar Danielson had died?

A.   Yes, it did.

Q.   I wanted to talk a little bit about some of your additional qualifications besides what we've already discussed.

Did you work on a number of Surgeon General's Reports on smoking and health?

A.   I have.

Q.   And in what capacity, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Well, usually three capacities:  One, you can be a reviewer; number two, you can be asked to contribute and write sections of the report; number three, you can do both of those things.

So I've done all three of those.  So I've been asked to contribute.  I've been asked to review.  And, in some instances, like the 2014 report and the 2012 report, I was asked to not only contribute sections but to review the entire report at the end to provide feedback to the Surgeon General's office prior to its release.

Q.   And I don't want to go through each of these, Doctor, but the NCI specifically you're listed as committee chair for the NCI commit study.

Can you describe to the jury what the commit study is?  What it involved?

A.   Sure.  It's community intervention trial for smoking cessation.  It was really geared towards heavy smokers.  So people smoking 25 or more cigarettes per day are defined as heavy smokers.  They tend to have the greatest burden of disease related to cigarette use.

And so this was a -- a randomized trial.  It was quite unique because they randomized 11 pairs of communities.  So 22 communities in North America.  11 of them got randomized to have an intervention.  That went on between the late 1980s and up to around 1994.

And then the other group was a control, and we created cohorts of smokers; in other words, we sampled smokers, and then we followed them over time and then observed whether our interventions, which went on with doctors and workplaces and the mass media, were having an impact on changing the smoking behavior of the people that were surveyed.

So we selected random samples of smokers in these communities.  And it was a large study, over 22,000 people in the -- in the survey.  I was a PI of one of the institutions that sort of created the trial and ran it.  We had two communities in New York. Binghamton and Utica, New York, were the committees I ran, but I also chaired the evaluation committee which put out all the papers and devised, really, the strategy

for this study.

Q.   And did that include studying nicotine addiction and cessation among these 22,000 smokers?

A.   Sure.  I mean, it was -- we were interested to see who would respond to these interventions, who was successful in quitting, how many people were going to quit.

Obviously we were trying to increase the cessation rates among smokers, and so we devel- -- you know, this trial is a large source of data which we continued after the trial was concluded.  I received grant funding, both from NCI and some foundations, to continue to follow the smokers.  So we actually have data following out these smokers 17 years after they were recruited into the study in the mid-1980s to see who quit.

So we can look at average annual quit rates. About 3 to 4 percent of smokers are successful in quitting in any given year; how many people overall attempted to quit, which is just about everybody.  Most quit and fail.

So a lot of the data that we have today on indicators of dependence and so on, a lot of it comes from studies that we -- from this particular trial because it was such a large study.  It's not the only

source, but we published a number of studies that have influenced some of the tools that people use to define who's dependent and who's not.

Q. I wanted to briefly mention, Dr. Cummings, in your qualifications, editorial boards and journals for which you act as a reviewer or have acted as a reviewer.

And we see those listed here, including the Journal of Cancer, Nicotine and Tobacco Research, The Journal of Addictive Behaviors, Lancet, The Journal of the American Medical Association.

Can you describe just very briefly what it means to be a reviewer for a journal like this?

A.   Sure.  You're sent an article by the editor of the journal, and they ask you, as a peer reviewer, to give a critique back to the authors and a recommendation back to the editorial board as to whether the paper merits funding, revisions, or acceptance.

And that's -- they typically will send out papers to three or four reviewers to get their opinions so they can get sort of a cross-section of, you know, whether, you know, this is just an outstanding paper and everybody agrees or everybody dis- -- you know, agrees that it's terrible and it shouldn't be published or something in between.

And so that's the -- that's the way we try to

advance science.  You know, it's the job of the peer reviewers:  The topic novel?  Are the methods appropriate?  Are the conclusions, you know, valid and not overreaching?

And, you know, you provide comments back, and then the editorial board makes decisions ultimately on what papers get accepted and which ones do not.

Q.   In acting as a reviewer for these and -- and other journals, have you reviewed and commented -- given your expert opinion on issues surrounding nicotine addiction, how addiction causes disease, and issues related to what you'll be testifying to here today?

A.   Sure.  I'll give -- I mean, obviously, the journals that contact me and send me articles, they're sending me articles related to areas of my expertise. So those would be in the area of nicotine dependence and how you measure it; what the science shows regarding, you know, success in quitting; and -- you know, and --and the design of cigarettes; and a whole host of areas that I've been involved with.

And that's -- try to usually get three or four requests to review every week.  It's part of the process.  So I've served on editorial boards on the other side, you know, like, searching for people who will take the time to give you reviews.  You don't get

paid for these reviews.  You just do them as part of the job.  And it's also a way of keeping current on the science that's coming out.

So I -- I try to do as many as I can and have -- usually I do two or three a week.

Q.   You've also received grants and contracts; is that correct?

A.   Sure.  You know, it's publish or perish, but really it -- you know, on a research job, it's get grant funding or perish.  You're always writing grants, and it's part of the way to build science.  And I've been very successful with my grant funding.

I've been funded from the National Cancer Institute continuously since 1983.  So -- and have probably received about 70 or so grants from various funding agencies.  Mostly from the National Institutes of Health, American Cancer Society, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

But most of it comes from the federal government, which funds our -- our -- most research that's done in the -- in the country on all health topics.

Q.   And is it also true, as with the previous slides we've looked at, that funding that you've received from the NCI, from National Institutes of

Health, is directed toward research in the areas you'll be talking about?  Marketing to youth, cigarettes, addiction?

A.   Yes.  And, you know, just to be clear, those grants don't come to me.  You write them on behalf of your institution.  So when I was at Roswell Park, the grants came to Roswell Park.  And as the principal investigator of that grant, you would manage the research and the budget around it.  And same is true with the medical university where I am now.

So those grants go to the institutions.  You manage the science that's outlined in the research plan that's presented there.

And it's a very competitive process to get these grants.  You're always writing grants, and you're very happy when you get one funded.  I think they're funding now about 1 out of -- 6 out of 100 grants at the federal level.  So, you know, 94 of those grants go into rewrite or give up, and the other 6 are funded.

So they're -- it's a very highly competitive process to get the grant funding.

Q.   And the jury -- well, let me ask you first: Some awards that you've received -- again, I don't want to go through all of them.  I would ask you, though, to describe, if you would, the last two, both of which it

looks like you received in 2009.

A.   Yeah.  If you ran long enough, they start handing out awards to you, I guess.  I got a career award in 2009 named after John Slade who was one of the real leaders in our field around nicotine addiction. And that was from the Society For Research on Nicotine. And then that same year I got the Luther Terry award, named after Luther Terry, who was the Surgeon General in 1964.  And this was given out by the American Cancer Society every three years.  So they give it out actually at the World Conference on Smoking and Health.

So I -- in 2009 they -- they sent me over to Mumbai, India, where they have the conference, and they give you a little medal and everything.  It's quite an honor, actually, to get that award.  And I was nominated and very fortunate to get that award.

Q.   The jury has heard, Dr. Cummings, about the peer-review process.  I just wanted to ask briefly: Have you -- we see at the top you've written more than 400 peer-reviewed articles?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And do they include the subject areas listed here?  Again, the subject areas you'll be addressing with the jury.

consumer smoking behavior.  So, you know, why people smoke, why they quit, how hard or easy it is for people to quit, and why there's individual variation methods to help people quit smoking.

And when the documents became available, you know, I focused a lot of my attention -- because it was a new source of data -- to understand, you know, how the engineering of the product influences smoking behavior, what the companies knew, you know, some of their statements about marketing and who they were marketing to or not to, to address those questions.

And it's -- as I said, it's a continuing source of data for my research.

Q.   And are these examples, Dr. Cummings, of your peer-reviewed work?  The 50 years of tobacco industry misinformation, how that affects consumer misperceptions about smoking?  Is that -- these are examples, I take it, of articles you've done?

A.   Yeah.  Yeah.

Q.   You've just told us you've published in marketing, including marketing to youth.

Are those subjects you'll be talking about today?

initiation and exposure to advertising and how advertising influences their perceptions of cigarettes and what pro- -- what brands they select and so on and -- as well as looking internally at the industry documents and what they said about it.

And it's all consistent.  It's all been actually well-summarized in reports like the Surgeon General.

Q.   And have you also published specifically in the area of package warnings and consumer perceptions, smokers' perceptions of the warnings on cigarettes? A.   Yes.  You know, we've done a lot of health warnings, particularly more recently.  I have studies now going on in 22 countries so we -- a number of countries -- Canada was the first to put on pictorial warnings on their packs.  Countries have expanded their warnings to a larger size, front and back.

And with the studies in the 22 countries, we've been able to look at the effect -- because you can't randomize countries to decide what policies they're going to put into effect.

We have cohorts that have been tracking smokers to see what their reaction is when one country puts these warnings on and others don't; and you can look at the change, whether they're noticing them, reading them,

whether it's affecting their smoking behavior and so on.

And we probably created most of the evidence that exists on the impact of health warnings today and which ones are effective and which ones are not.

Q.   And, of course, Dr. Cummings, you've told us that you've published on nicotine addiction.

Are these examples all of peer-reviewed publications where you've shared your opinions and research on nicotine addiction?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And are the opinions that you share in these published articles consistent with the opinions you're going to share with the jury in the courtroom?

A.   I hope so.  Yes. (Laughter.)

Q.   Finally, I understand you're here talking with the jury today.  Are jurors the only people with whom you share your opinions on the subject areas we've talked about?

A.   No.  I'll share it with anybody.  I used to do programs regularly in schools.  Speaking to school children I would probably do, you know, 10 or 11 assemblies a year to school children mainly when I was up in Buffalo; but medical students, of course, or graduate students.

I lectured practicing physicians doing CME-type of continuing medical education programming.  I'm usually the person that gets contacted when there's a story out on smoking, because of the media, so I -- I do that.  And I lectured many different groups, patients through our clinics.

You know, I've given conferences to lawyers about the documents that came and fell in my lap in some of the archives I've put together, because it's quite relevant today.

Judges and juries have created, you know, exhibits and so on that travel around the country to medical conferences on these topics.

Q.   And, of course, you testify in trials and you're paid for your time, Dr. Cummings?

A.   I am now.

Q.   And what is your hourly rate?

A.   250 an hour for trial testimony.

Q.   And you charged our firm, of course, to come here today and to prepare for the case?

A.   I did.

A.   Probably 75 or 80 trials.  In terms of testimony it's a larger number.  I have probably done over 130 depositions.  So that's where before the trial they get to ask you questions and you share your opinions.

So I've been doing this since 1996.  It's -- I happen to have unique knowledge.  Some of that unique knowledge is it so happened I was in the right place at the right time in New York when those documents became available; and I feel obligated to share that information.

And, as I said, I -- when I started doing this I thought it would be over.  I didn't charge originally. But it's a substantial part of my time and I think it's important, so I do charge for my time here.

Q.   And if you added up -- I think you said -- 1996 was the first time you testified.

Going back that, I guess, 19, 20 years, how much have you earned over the course of that period of time?

A.   I get asked this question probably in every trial.  It's over a million dollars over 19 years or so that I've done it.

A lot of that has been more recently because there have been many more of the trials that have

happened since 2009.  But it's over a million.  About 10,000 per case if you want to work it out on a regular basis.  That's how it sort of works out.

Q.   All right.  And I want to ask -- we see just a quick summary of everything you've talked about so far this morning, Dr. Cummings.  I want to talk about this case in particular, and the evidence that you've reviewed, first of all.

In the Lamar Danielson case, is this a summary of the -- of the evidence that you reviewed in the case in order to bring in your opinions on his case?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And that included all these volumes of depositions, which you've just described a few minutes ago?

A.   Right.  I think when you first contacted me there were a few, and then they started to come in more and more.  So at the end of the day, it turned out to be 21 depositions that I reviewed.

Q.   And in your -- having reviewed all of these, are these primarily or maybe even exclusively depositions that were taken by Philip Morris or another tobacco company of the witnesses who were involved in this case?

A.   Yes.

Can you describe what interrogatories are for the jury?

A.   Sure.  Well, my understanding, you know, questions are usually posed by the defendants and they want answers from the plaintiff about certain facts. And so there's a -- a Q and A type of information that's prepared in advance.  And I usually review that because it's a useful starting point to find out who is who, you know, what are the relationships, who are some of these people, you know, various dates that are relevant. So that's the interrogatories.

Q.   And, if you would, can you walk the jury just very briefly through an overview of Lamar Danielson's lifetime in terms of his life events.

A.   Sure.  He was born in October 1953.  I think 20 days -- he's 20 days different than me in terms of age. I was born in 1953 also.  September 25th.  I think he was born on October 17th, so very similar.  So I was interested right away because I grew up, really, during the same era that Mr. Danielson grew up.

He first started smoking sometime in the late 1960s.  Certainly in high school, by all accounts, he

was smoking.  He graduates high school in 1971, um, and, you know, meets Micah, his wife.  And -- and they get married in 1977.

He eventually adopts Micah's child, Billy, a little later and they have two other children, Jennifer and Sandi; and he's a Marlboro smoker.

Throughout this entire time he really is part of the Marlboro generation.  And he's diagnosed with lung cancer at a young age.  You know, he was 41 years old in 1994.  Dead in 1995 at the age of 42.

Q.   I want to move, Dr. Cummings, into that first area of testimony that you had on the first slide, and that is the area of Lamar Danielson's addiction to cigarettes containing nicotine.  I think the jury actually saw this definition earlier.

Can you share with the jury this definition of addiction from NIDA and why you use this definition in your testimony?

A.   Well, not just in my testimony.  This is the definition that I teach to our medical students so they have to understand how to define addiction.  And this is from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and defining it is -- you know, addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease, because addictive drugs alter the brain. Nicotine is an addictive drug and it alters the brain.

And it results like many other addictive substances in a chronic relapsing disorder.  Some people try to refrain, end up falling back and very -- so you look for those patterns behaviorally when you try to assess whether somebody is addicted or not.

It's characterized by compulsive use, you know, how much are they using.  They use either every day or can they use it maybe just on the weekend?  That makes a big difference.

So persistent daily use, frequent use, you know, pack and a half, up to three packs a day, you've got a compulsive user of cigarettes, and use despite knowledge of harm is a hallmark of addiction.

People don't choose to get lung cancer so continued issue despite knowledge of harm, you know, trying to quit, you know you've got to quit, and yet you can't stop, that's compulsive addictive behavior.

Q.   And I know we'll go through the evidence, Dr. Cummings, but let me ask you now.

If you look at each element of this definition -- chronic relapses.  Would that match Lamar Danielson?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Characterized by compulsive drug-seeking, would that match up with Mr. Danielson?

A.   It did, yes.

Q.   And use despite harmful consequences and knowledge of harmful consequences.  Is that all true for Mr. Danielson?

A.   Yes, it is.

Q.   Is there any dispute in this case -- having reviewed the evidence while we're talking about that --that at some point Mr. Danielson knew, of course, that cigarette smoking was not good for him?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  And he continued to smoke despite that knowledge?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did he try and quit after acquiring that knowledge?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I meant to ask right at the outset, Dr. Cummings, about addiction versus choice.  And you see the question here:  Does a person addicted to nicotine lose all of their free will?

A.   The answer is no.

Q.   And does a person addicted to nicotine have a perfectly free choice to smoke like they might choose a Sprite versus a Coke?

A.   The answer is no.  When somebody is addicted,

their choice is constrained, which is why when we look at smokers and follow them over a year, you know, people who quit, only about 3 or 4 percent are successful in staying off for at least six months.  And so that's not free choice; that's reflecting a lot of effort going into quit and a lot of failure.

Chronic relapsing disorder is characteristic of addiction.  Cigarettes is -- certainly nicotine in cigarettes is what drives people to continue to smoke and find it hard to quit.

But, yes, people do overcome nicotine addiction.  There are lots of people who have quit smoking.  And there are lots of people who've quit other addictive substances like alcohol and heroin, cocaine and other, you know, addicting substances.

It doesn't mean that those substances aren't addictive or those people weren't addicted; it just --you know, they were addicted and if you have to struggle, it's not just like walking away; it's not a free choice because of the way the product is actually engineered.

Q.   And even when someone --

the hearing of the jury.)

MR. GERAGHTY:  Two issues.  I think Mr. Schultz may have addressed the one issue.  I haven't objected up to this point, but there have been several instances -- and in the last question and answer was one -- where there was a very specific question.  It was does a person addicted to nicotine -- it was the exact question on the slide and then we got about a -- a three- or four-paragraph dissertation.

And I realize Dr. Cummings has a lot of knowledge, and I realize that they're trying to move things along; but it makes it very difficult for me to be able to make objections when we get very long, rambling answers where he's just basically giving a dissertation and it's not a true question and answer format.

So I would ask that we try to adhere to that a little bit so that we can make objections and then --

MR. SCHULTZ:  If I can be heard on that briefly, Judge.

THE COURT:  What's the second thing?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Are you saying you just took these off -- then the second issue has been

resolved.

THE COURT:  Okay.  You may address the first issue.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm sorry, Judge.  Just in this instance -- and I understand his point, but I asked if there's a difference between free choice and no choice and he explained what the difference is.  I asked him to explain the answer and there will be questions like that.

THE COURT:  I do not find the last response offensive in the way Counsel is cautioning.  It's with every expert -- it's with every plaintiff's expert, every defense expert.  They have a story to tell.

So, again, I don't mind you giving direction --that -- that -- that -- frankly, it helps the -- me be placed in a situation where any witness hijacks the proceedings and we can't reasonably anticipate the objections and things like that, might get into an area which would be inappropriate.

So I'm not going to limit either of you guys strictly on this, because, you know, you just can't give experts yes/no questions.  But do -- you know, make sure that he's giving answers to you -- the questions that you're asking and -- and, you know,

he should know that -- I'm sure you guys have talked before and he's been your witness before, so I'm sure the areas you know where you're going and you have the ability to ask a question that will get him in an area.

So it's -- it's the ones that sort of get out of control and it gets away from this.  And it's not just this witness; it's almost every expert witness I've ever seen.  Okay?

MR. SCHULTZ:  May we have that conversation, Judge?

THE COURT:  Yes.  Thanks.

THE COURT:  You may proceed. MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Your Honor. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   While we're talking about free choice versus addiction, I want to ask also about the notion of enjoyment.

You've told us that you have dealt with tens of thousands -- more than 10,000 addicted smokers; is that right?

A.   Yeah, personally.  I mean, they came to my clinics and we followed them for years; and, yes, some

of them many times came back to my clinic so they were repeat offenders coming to my clinic.

Q. Do addicted smokers, in your experience, your clinical experience, particularly, Dr. Cummings, enjoy smoking cigarettes?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Do addicted smokers -- have you seen addicted smokers who have told you, "Cigarette smoking relaxes me"?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And that cigarettes can provide stress relief?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is it an either/or, based or your experience? Either you're addicted, or you enjoy or smoke for relaxation?

A.   No, not at all.  It's not an either/or thing. Addicted smokers are smoking for nicotine, and, you know, the absence of nicotine makes you feel -- you begin to get withdrawal.  You don't feel normal.  You need to smoke.  And you take a puff on a cigarette, you put the nicotine back and you feel good.  That's enjoyment.  Satisfaction.

And for a lot of people, stress is a trigger and makes them want to smoke more.  And nicotine has effects on certain neurotransmitters that affect reward,

enjoyment, as well as mood modulation, relaxation.  So it has this dual effect.

And they're just noticing the physiological effects I would expect.  And in my personal experience have seen most smokers say, yeah, they enjoy smoking. They wish they could quit, but they still enjoy smoking. In fact, that's one of the reasons it's hard to quit, because of nicotine addiction.

Q.   Would that be another way, Dr. Cummings, of saying that enjoyment of smoking is a feature of addiction?

A.   Yes.

Q. Again, talking about nicotine versus free choice, Doctor, I want to talk about Philip Morris documents.

Do these quotes that are on this slide all come out of some of the previously secret Philip Morris documents that you described to us earlier?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q. In 1988, what happened in terms of public health and the issue of addiction in the United States?

A.   The Surgeon General of the United States put out a report on why people smoke.  And, you know, it was entitled "Nicotine Addiction," because that was the reason -- that was the conclusion of the report.  People

smoke because they're addicted.  It's nicotine in the drug that keeps people addicted.

And the behavioral and pharmacologic effects of nicotine are similar to other drugs of abuse, such as heroin and cocaine, because they affect the brain in a similar way.  And behaviorally you'll see the same kind of relapse rates in treatment programs for people trying to quit smoking as you do for people trying to get off of other addictive drugs.

Q.   And when that report came out in 1988, Doctor, did the industry say, "We agree.  We've known that for a long time"?  Was that their response publicly?

A.   No.  Publicly they said, you know, "We don't think cigarettes are addictive.  It's irresponsible to say cigarettes are addictive.  To put them in the same class as other addictive drugs would be misleading to the American public."

That's what they told the American public. They said they don't believe nicotine is addictive, and that was their mantra really from 1988 up to 2000.

Q.   But you told us these quotes come out of previously secret Philip Morris documents.  The first, "Why do people smoke?  A.  Physiological reasons.  3, addiction."

that quote was entered into a Philip Morris business record in 1959?

A.   He would have been about five or six years old at that point.

Q.   And, again, 1969 -- tell the jury, if you would, please -- we see the name H. Wakeham. Who was Mr. Wakeham?

A.   Helmut Wakeham was the -- you know, basically the vice president in charge of research and development at Philip Morris.  He was the top head of the research program at Philip Morris.

And that is a quote out of a presentation he made to the board of directors of the Philip Morris Tobacco Company, talking about their human behavioral research program, you know, which was exploring why people smoke, and he gave them the answer.  He said the primary motivation for smoking is to obtain the pharmacologic effects of nicotine.

Q.   Is that consistent or inconsistent with what Philip Morris was saying publicly about this at the time?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object,

Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

A.   It's inconsistent.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q. We see another quote from five years later, "People smoked to get nicotine," also from Dr. -- or Mr. Wakeham?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And tell the jury on that last quote, who was Janet Brown?

A.   She was an outside attorney.  In other words, she worked -- well, she worked for the tobacco companies, but she didn't -- she wasn't a member of the tobacco industry.  She was outside counsel that they employed.

And the CTR, Council for Tobacco Research, was the organization funding research on various issues related to smoking and health by the cigarette companies, and one of the projects that they were funding was some research up at the University of Rochester by Leo Abood, who --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is no longer

responsive to the question that was posed, I think

at this point, based on prior sidebar.

THE COURT:  I overrule the objection.  Thank

you.

You may continue your response.

A.   So Leo Abood was doing research funded by CTR,

and the lawyers who were concerned, they did a review of the research that they were funding on nicotine and the effect of nicotine on the brain, because Dr. Abood's work potentially could lead to an antagonist in the brain that would block the effect of nicotine.

And so they said a nicotine blocker or substitute could put the industry out of business overnight and we should cut out that research, which they did, by the way. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   These are a handful of quotes.  You told us, Dr. Cummings, there are millions of pages.  Let me ask you, have you ever seen an internal Philip Morris document that said smoking is just a matter of free choice?

A.   No.

Q.   And have you seen any other industry members, either the CTR, the Tobacco Institute, or other companies, who internally said, "You know what, nicotine doesn't have anything to do with this.  Smoking is just a matter of free choice"?

A.   No.

Q.   I want to ask you about motivation to quit. This is an area you told us that you studied.

And on the slide, we have everyone who quits is

motivated to quit, whether they succeed or not.  Is that your opinion?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And is that based on your clinical experience and your research?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Some people, of course, when they quit, they stay quit permanently.  Most people relapse.  All were motivated to quit.  Can you explain that to the jury?

A.   Well, any effort to quit smoking, be it an attempt to try to cut back or, you know, refrain and, you know, throw your cigarettes out and try to get through the day without smoking, using any kind of aids to try to, you know, assist you in doing that, that's all indications -- behavioral indications of motivation to quit.  And that's important, and most people do make quit attempts and most fail.  But anybody who makes a quit attempt is motivated to quit.

Q.   A strong motivation to quit predicts a quit attempt, but does not predict long-term abstinence or staying quit.  Is that, first of all, an opinion based on peer-reviewed literature or science that you've reviewed?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And also in your own experience?

A.   My own experience and my own research.  We followed tens of thousands of smokers and looked at what they said initially as to whether they were motivated to quit smoking.  How motivated are you to quit smoking? Are you going to quit smoking in the next month or six months?

And then we predict, you know, down the line a year later, two years later, who is smoking and who is not.  And it turns out that those who say they are going to make a quit attempt and are motivated to make a quit attempt do make quit attempts, but it doesn't predict who's able to stay off of cigarettes down the line.

It turns out that the people who stay off are the ones who were most -- or least addicted, and the ones who end up back smoking again are the ones who are most dependent on nicotine.  So while being motivated predicts making a quit attempt, it doesn't predict ability to abstain from cigarettes long term.

Q.   You mentioned fear of smoking-related disease is a strong predictor of motivation to quit, but does not ensure someone will completely abstain.

Is that similar to what you just said, that that's one motivation among others?

A.   Sure.  I mean, knowing about the health consequences, experiencing health consequences, you

know, that's one of the reasons we run our program in our hospital.  A lot of people are there because they're sick.  They have the bedside counselor right there. It's a good teachable moment to try to get them off of cigarettes.

When we follow people up after they leave the hospital, 90 percent of them are back to smoking.  Okay. So while some of them -- it's a good time because they are motivated to quit, they are making quit attempts, and by the way, most of those people are making quit attempts and we're trying to facilitate that, the reality is it's hard to overcome nicotine addiction. People struggle to stop.

Q.   If motivation to quit does not predict permanent cessation, what is the best predictor of permanent cessation?

A.   It's how addicted somebody is.  And our best measure of how addicted somebody is to nicotine is measured by the Heaviness of Smoking Index, which is a two-item scale that is -- that represents two questions: How much you smoke per day and time to first cigarette of the day.

And those two items -- it sounds simple and been called for hundreds of other items that have been tried.  Those two items are very effective at measuring

the strength of somebody's nicotine dependence and is our best, most validated and accurate, reliable predictor of who is able to quit and stay off.

Q.   Is this the Heaviness of Smoking Index, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I want to point out something that's been pointed out previously in the trial.  Even if you score a zero on the Heaviness of Smoking Index, would you still have some level of addiction according to this metric?

A.   Yeah, of course.  This is a test that's used for people who are persistent daily smokers.  You don't do the Heaviness of Smoking test for people who aren't smoking on a routine basis.  Most people are persistent daily smokers.  If you are, then we apply the Heaviness of Smoking Index to see how dependent you are.

If you score in the high -- you know, a dependence category of high addiction 5 or 6, you're going to have a harder time to quit than somebody who is in the, you know, mild addiction.  So even somebody who is smoking a cigarette a day probably has some dependence, but it's probably at a low level.

Q.   And of the two questions, Dr. Cummings, does one of them -- has one of them been shown through

scientific work, research studies, and publications to be a stronger predictor?

A.   Yeah.  Time to first cigarette turns out to be the strongest of the predictors, if you had to pick one, and the reason for that is pretty obvious.  Amount smoked per day is dictated by a lot of factors external to the individual, like how much money you can afford to spend on cigarettes, where you can light them up.  That has impact on number of cigarettes per day.

But time to first cigarette -- if you're smoking first thing before you plant your foot on the floor in the morning, you're addicted.  If you're smoking just before you go to bed at night, if you're waking up in the middle of the night to have a cigarette, these are all strong indications of heavy dependence, and those people need more help.  Standard therapies like nicotine patches and gum probably don't work very well.  You probably need more than that to be successful in quitting.

Q.   Has the Heaviness of Smoking Index been used -- taking the scores on people and then correlating them to cancers been used to predict the occurrence of future lung cancers?

A.   Yes.  So in other words, if you just measure that, and then you control for how much somebody smokes,

how long they've smoked, which is the traditional way of measuring sort of dose of exposure as it relates to disease risk, even when you take those out of the equation, time to first cigarette is an independent predictor of developing lung cancer, head and neck cancers, I believe is -- and I've seen a study recently on predicting having a heart attack as a result of smoking.

And it's because it's a reflection of --nicotine addiction is that indispensable link that leads ultimately to the repeated exposures that cause the disease.  If you're addicted, that's who gets sick from smoking, because you keep exposing yourself to those harmful chemicals over and over again.

Q.   So this is the Heaviness of Smoking Index, Dr. Cummings.

You also had what you list as key characteristics of nicotine-addicted smokers.

What is the difference there? A.   Well, this is what I use.  So you take that definition from NIDA, you know, chronic relapsing brain disorder, compulsive use, knowledge of harm.  I just converted it into things that you can actually assess fairly easily in people.

So do you have evidence that somebody has been

a persistent daily user over a long period of time?  So not a user here or there, but every day for, you know, months, years, decades.  That's the first indicator.

Then I use the Heaviness of Smoking Index, those two items we just talked about, time to first cigarette, amount smoked.  Those are really the primary indicators.  And for doctors who don't have a lot of time to ask questions, those are the three things that I tell them to ask about.

Then there's some secondary features that are worth looking at as well.  Early age of initiation.  The earlier in life that you get exposed to an addictive drug, the more likely it is to make it harder to quit later in life because your brain is still developing as a teenager right actually up to about age 25.

So the earlier your brain is exposed to an addictive substance, the more likely it is the person will struggle as an adult to quit, so I look at early age of initiation.

Any evidence of difficulty retraining from smoking.  Now, it is possible for people, of course, to be addicted and not make quit attempts.  You know, you can still be addicted if you're smoking two or three packs a day and you smoke first thing in the morning, but many people do make quit attempts, and then if they

have and they've had difficulty, we look at the chronic relapsing part of that as an indicator of addiction.

And then when they try to quit, did they experience any withdrawal or cravings for a cigarette? And there are characteristic withdrawal symptoms: anxiety, irritability, gaining weight, urges to smoke, those kinds of things.

And then use despite knowledge of harm.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, did you apply these characteristics to Dr. -- to Mr. Danielson based on your review of the evidence in this case?

A.   I did.  I went through those 21 depositions, the medical records, the interrogatories, all that evidence, and he met all of these criteria, in my opinion.

Q.   We have "Persistent daily use, 25-plus years." Based on your review of the evidence, it's your opinion that, other than times he may have been trying to quit, he smoked on a daily basis for that period of time?

A.   Correct.

Q.   "Time to first cigarette:  Smoked first thing in the morning."

Is that your conclusion based on the evidence you reviewed?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You have "One to two or more packs per day." Are there different reports of the amounts Mr. Danielson smoked from different people or at different times in his life?

A.   Yes.  There are different reports and reports that, you know, varied at different times of his life. Like I said, most of the reports were pretty consistent at about a pack and a half to two.  But there were reports by some people that were around him, his wife and one of his coworkers, his smoking buddy, who, you know, said he was smoking later in life around two to three packs of cigarettes a day.  So that would be 40 to 60 cigarettes.  That's a lot of cigarettes to smoke.

Q.   And did you see -- while we're talking about it -- that Mr. Danielson himself, both in some life insurance forms and to a physician, self-reported a pack to a pack and a half a day?

A.   I did.

Q.   Now, I want to ask you -- I think it's been asked before -- in your experience, do addicted smokers often underreport to their healthcare providers the amount that they're smoking?

Thank you.

Q.   As part your work, Dr. Cummings, with all the smokers you talked about, do you often not only interview the smoker themselves but talk to family members, people who are close to them? A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you follow the literature, or have you seen literature on how people report smoking to their doctors?

A.   I follow the literature.  I contributed to the literature.  We've done studies on underreporting of smoking to healthcare providers using biochemical testing.  In other words, you know, somebody comes in, provides a urine sample, saliva, or blood.  We'll check it for various constituents of smoke and then compare it to what they have self-reported to the healthcare provider.

And I've done studies where we've interviewed family members to see what they know.

So in our surveys, because sometimes people

Family members generally know longer quits. They don't know a lot of frequent quits that happen because they're --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor --A.   -- short-term duration.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is beyond the scope of the question.  It's nonresponsive now.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Can we approach on this particular issue, Your Honor, very briefly?

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, based on your own work that you've just described for the jury, including research and clinical experience, do addicted smokers often underreport to their healthcare providers the amount of smoking?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Same objections as previously

stated, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Correct.  The objection is

preserved and overruled.

A.   Yes, they do. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Has your research and clinical experience suggested any reasons why people commonly do that?

A.   Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Leading now, Your Honor. THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection. Thank you.

their doctor as well.  And so they sort of say, "Well, you know, maybe instead of those two packs, I'm going to get down to one because I'm cutting back."

And so for a variety reasons, then, we tend to find, yes, people underreport.  They underreport in surveys too. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q. And as I understood your response, Doctor, part of it you also talked about how your studies took a look at how families remember quit attempts.

Did I understand that correctly?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And can you describe for us -- let me ask you this:  Would it have any bearing on the evidence that you've read in this case?

A.   It does.

Q.   Can you describe for me what you were going into on that particular -- just restricted to that area -- on remembering longer quits, I think is what you said?

A.   Right.  People tend -- around a smoker will tend to report those quit attempts that tended to last a little bit longer or utilized particular aids for quitting.

So they might, you know -- in this particular

case, I think there was some recall of, you know, use of the nicotine patch. There was also a quit attempt where Mr. Danielson was running and biking, you know, that was a little longer.

But most quit attempts are short duration, done in the closet by the smoker, and they tend not to be recalled as readily because they were of short duration. And sometimes the family members had no idea that the smoker is quitting.

So there was a lot more quitting going on than what necessarily the family members know. That's based on the research in the published literature, as well as my own research.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, you've already told us "Began as a teen in the 1980s."  We'll look at some evidence on difficulty in refraining from smoking.

You mentioned nicotine dosing, failed quit attempts, withdrawal symptoms -- which you've addressed briefly already -- and use despite knowledge of harms.

Is it your opinion, based on your review of all the depositions and the other evidence in the case, all of these apply to Lamar Danielson? A.   Yes.

Q.   Is this a slide, Dr. Cummings, that kind of helps you -- we talked about free choice and addiction,

and now we've talked about the characteristics of addicted smokers.  What does this particular slide speak to in that regard?

A.   Well, it's just talking about the fact that, when people are really choosing to smoke, it's usually during the uptake phase, which for most people occurs during their teenage years, which was true in -- based on my review of the evidence, in this case.

And there's a period of experimentation.  And once people become, you know, persistent daily smokers, they're sort of in the addiction cycle, and they're --you know, gradually the -- the wanting to smoke becomes the need to smoke.  And when that process moves over to needing to smoke, needing your daily supply of nicotine to feel normal, then you're addicted, and it's hard to get out of that cycle.

And not everybody who smokes becomes addicted, but many do.  Most do, actually.

Q. And is there a -- a generally accepted -- or at least accepted by you, based on your work -- time period between experimentation and last free choice?

Let me ask you before that:  Does this usually occur in the teenage years?

A.   Yes, it does.

Q.   And is there any sort of rule of thumb or --

or -- or number that you have based on your research and experience as to how long this experimentation period might last before a teen finds himself in that addiction cycle you described?

A.   No.  It -- generally you can see -- you know, it varies.  There's a fair amount of variability for individuals.  For some it may take, you know, weeks, months, up to two years on average.

But usually you see somebody initiating smoking.  Average age of initiation of smoking in this country today is about age 14.  And then you look at regular use, and the median for regular use is usually age 16 or 17.

So once you get to regular use, you're talking about persistent daily use.  So that's roughly a two-year period, but that's across a population.  So a lot of individual variability in between.

We don't have the details, in -- in my review of the evidence in this case, to say that it was, you know, a month or two years.  We know that he was --Mr. Danielson, based on my review of the evidence, was smoking on a persistent daily basis when he was in high school; and, based on testimony with one of his friends, he was, you know, smoking every day, you know, by -- by around 1968, '69 period.

Q.   And he would have turned 15 in 1968?  14 going on 15?

A.   That's right.

Q. All right. You have this addiction cycle here, Dr. Cummings. Of course, people can quit, even addicted smokers.  You've told us that, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   If somebody does quit smoking, does it guarantee that they won't have any health effects from having smoked for many years?

A. No, there's no guarantee. Obviously the longer the duration of exposure, the greater the risk of having a serious health problem.

But half of the lung cancers today are diagnosed in former smokers due to smoking, and that's related to the dose because -- you know, a lot of these diseases have a, you know, long -- what they call "latency period."  So the cancer's -- what you're really doing is -- with cancer, it's when you turn the normal cell.  And the body's ability, when it's damaged by an environmental exposure like cigarette smoke, it does DNA damage.  When the body's ability to repair that damage is overwhelmed and you can't repair the damage, then that cancer cell begins to grow.

And we can't say with certainty, you know,

somebody might have cancer, latent, for 20 years and then find it.  Which is why we do lung cancer screening today in somebody who has a, you know, a 30-pack-year history of smoking.  That's the recommendation, because they have a risk -- they're at high risk of developing lung cancer.

Q.   We've heard in the trial already, Dr. Cummings, 60 million Americans have quit smoking.  Would that number include people who were indicated?

A.   Mostly addicted, yes.

Q. And is that the same as saying that 60 million lives were saved in light of what you've just described to the jury?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object.  This is

argumentative and irrelevant.

THE COURT:  I would overrule the objection. Thank you.

A.   Well, certainly getting somebody off of cigarettes does save lives.  And it's the first thing that we tell a person to do is to get off of cigarettes, and then we can deal with things like early detection for lung cancer or heart disease or other diseases after that.

So the sooner somebody quits, the better off. And -- but even in cancer patients diagnosed

with cancer, their therapy isn't as good if they keep smoking, and so we have a program for cancer patients.

So a lot of people sort of say, "Oh, it's too late."  It's actually not too late because your best shot at cancer therapy is that first course of therapy you're going to get.  And we see that people who continue in persistent smoking even with cancer end up having much poorer outcomes.

So we -- there's actually an urgency to get people to quit even if they have a serious chronic illness.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, we were talking about this period from experimentation, the last free choice, in this addiction cycle, even a cycle that -- that can be broken by quitting or by death, and you were talking about this occurring in the context of teenagers.  And I'd like to -- to move into that subject briefly.

Are you familiar with this pamphlet from Philip Morris put out in 2003 called "Raising Kids Who Don't Smoke"?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And in this pamphlet, Philip Morris says, "Focus on short-term consequences."

Is that referring to when you talk to your kids about smoking?

A.   Correct.

Q.   It says, "As adults, we know that smoking leads to life-threatening illnesses, such as heart disease, emphysema, and lung cancer, but most teenagers don't worry about long-term risks.  They can't imagine what it's like to be older or to be sick."

Again, based on your own clinical experience and your research, is that an accurate statement?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And that's true although most people, I think you told us, begin smoking as teenagers?

A.   Yeah, almost all smoking initiation occurs during the teenage years, about 90 percent of experimentation by the age of 18, and regular smoking --it's very rare to see somebody take up smoking after the age of 25.  So less than 5 percent of the population that do that.

Q.   And does that mean that that last free choice that you talked about on the last slide also occurs primarily in teenagers?

A.   That's true.

Q.   Was that true in the case of Lamar Danielson?

A.   It was.

Q.   It says, "Teens who smoke cigarettes could get -- get addicted quickly."  I think, based on what

you've told us, you would agree with that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What is this document, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Well, this is the presentation.  I think I showed a -- a quote previously from Dr. Helmut Wakeham to the board of directors in 1969.  And he's talking about the research program that Philip Morris is -- has initiated, their behavioral research program led by William Dunn.  And here he's posing the question why people smoke.  And he says, "It's got to be broken up into two questions.  First, why do people start?  And then you ask -- the second question is:  Why do people persist or continue to smoke after they've started?"

And he said, "There's general agreement on the answer to the first part:  The 16 to 20-year-old begins smoking for psychosocial reasons.  The act of smoking is symbolic.  It signifies adulthood.  He smokes to enhance his image in the eyes of his peers.  But the psychosocial motive is not enough to explain continued smoking.  Some other motive force takes over to make smoking rewarding in its own right."

And then he goes on a few pages later in this document in the presentation to the board of directors. He said, "We are of the conviction, in view of the foregoing," which he's explaining the research they're

doing, "that the ultimate explanation for the perpetuated cigarette habit resides in the pharmacologic effect of smoke upon the body of the smoker.  The effect being most rewarding to the individual under stress." MR.

this question.  It is even more embarrassing to the psychologist on my staff; but I can tell you this: Despite the -- the voluminous research in pseudo-sophisticated theories, no one seems to be able to give an explanation backed up by substantial solid facts."

Q.   And what page is that, Doctor?

A.   This is Page 8 and then he goes on with the next slide, which is what I previewed here.

Q.   If you can stop for one moment, Doctor.  We can pull this up so the jury can see what you're looking at. MR. SCHULTZ:  Can you pull this up, please,

Q.   In a document where they're talking about why a 16-year-old starts smoking? A.   Correct.

Q.   "We are measuring heart rate, respiratory rate, electrical resistance of the skin and muscle tension."

Did Philip Morris spend a lot of time studying why people smoke, what makes them smoke, concerned with how addiction interplays with smoking?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is cumulative. I object to the form of the question.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I would overrule the objection to the question asked.  Thank you.

Q.   Have you ever seen any document from Philip Morris that suggests all this work they were doing back when Lamar Danielson was 16 years old on smokers was designed to make their products less addictive to the 16-year-olds they're talking about?

A.   No.

Q.   Thank you.

MR. SCHULTZ:  If we can go back to the

presentation, please, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Does this fit, Dr. Cummings, with what you were telling the jury a few moments ago about experimentation, psychosocial reasons, smoking to look macho but eventually addiction taking over?

A.   Right.  I mean, the reasons that somebody starts smoking are very different than the reasons that contribute to somebody persisting in smoking; so, you know, a young person who hasn't smoked doesn't know the experience of nicotine.

It's usually aversive to start with; you have to overcome the aversive part of smoking.  Once you become acclimated, develop a tolerance to nicotine and need to smoke on a daily basis, the thing that drives the repeated exposure to the -- all the chemicals you get in cigarette smoke is nicotine addiction.

Q.   And if we look -- you had one other document before we talk about Mr. Danielson specifically from B&W.

Will you tell the jury who B&W is? A.   Brown & Williamson.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, we need the exhibit number so we can follow.

MR. SCHULTZ:  This would be LP2071. MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  That was a reasonable request. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   "Smoking starts with younger people for four reasons."

Is Brown & Williamson a cigarette company? A.   Yes.

Q.   One of the ones in the conspiracy at this time with Philip Morris?

A.   Correct.  And their popular brand at this time was Kool cigarettes.

Q.   "Smoking starts with younger people for four reasons.  One or more than -- one or more than one may be at work at any one time.

"The first factor is the desire of young people to look older than they really are.

"The second is peer pressure and doing what friends and authority figures do.

"The third reason is to rebel against parents with only modest risk.

"The fourth reason identified has to do with physical reaction.  This can be described as a 'high' or as a challenge to be strong enough to smoke without getting sick."

Based on your experience, Dr. Cummings, is Brown & Williamson accurately describing some of the reasons why teenagers start smoking?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And we've already seen it's your opinion they don't understand necessarily the long-term consequences?

A.   They're not considering the long-term consequences at all.  They don't understand the consequences and they're not relevant to their decision-making.

Q.   It says, "Smoking at that age, apparently forbidden by parents and other adult authorities, was a sign of courage and, importantly, reflected the 'us against them' attitude of the early ten years.  In discussing why they started to smoke, many cited the simple fact that their parents told them not to."

So in a sense, Dr. Cummings, can the forbidding

of smoking of teenagers actually be an incentive for them to take up smoking?

A.   Yeah.  I mean, anybody who is a parent knows if you've had a teenager, a little rebellion is actually normal.  What's abnormal is people getting addicted to a drug; but, you know, it's a normal developmental process to break away from mom and dad and rebellion is part of that process.  And the companies were studying why people were initiating cigarette smoking so they could exploit that in the engineering of their products and marketing.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object and move to strike and I'd like to approach about that last question and answer. THE COURT:  You may.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MR. GERAGHTY:  Can you take that down while we're having sidebars?

document from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company and without reference to a single document from Philip Morris, he just says this is what the companies, plural, studied and this is what they did to try to exploit young teenagers and smokers.  I don't have the exact quote of how he said that, but that was the gist of what he said.

And it -- if he's going to testify about what was in the minds -- Your Honor ruled in O'Hara and we've agreed to adhere that he shouldn't be offering opinions about the state of mind or the intent of the companies, unless he's got a document -- unless he's got a document that --

THE COURT:  Okay.  Don't worry about it.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Even I'm not helping you there. Unless he's got a document where that intent is expressed on the face of the document -- so he just took a B&W document, not our document, and he then says, well, this shows that the companies, including Philip Morris, were exploiting children.

I object to that.  I move to strike.  I move for a mistrial.  This is now -- the jury is going to be confused by these things.  There is no conspiracy to market to youth.

all, this is about why teenagers start smoking, just -- what we just talked about before we started with Dr. Cummings, and the industry's appreciation of that.  The -- the document we showed them immediately before --

MR. GERAGHTY:  You need to keep your voice down.

MR. SCHULTZ:  It's a Philip Morris document talking about why 16-year-olds start smoking. That's what this is.  It shows industry appreciation for this, just as I argued before Dr. Cummings took the stand.

We've also shown a 2003 document that's not tortious conduct that is consistent with this.  The jury is going to see a lot more of what Philip Morris knew that is perfectly consistent with this, so I don't think anything that's happened is not perfectly consistent with your previous ruling.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Here is the point of the whole argument by defense:  Not that Philip Morris itself was not looking at studying, examining, trying to understand why people started smoking and specifically looking at youth and talking about the reasons of why they would start and why they would continue.  The conclusion of his comment, his answer

was, "And the companies were studying why people were initiating cigarette smoking so they could exploit that in the engineering of their products and marketing."

Now, I've seen some of the documents and I've seen the documents that you likely are intending to introduce in which the -- the companies -- Philip Morris and others -- are saying that they are going to be marketing these products to youths.  These things are going to be capture -- helping to capture that particular market.  Okay?  And I think it's a reasonable inference that you're going to be able to draw.

But I thought one of the things that we very specifically identified as a limitation on the --the expert's testimony was to -- to give his interpretation of what the company documents said.

In other words, if the document which you referred to -- which he had you refer to, if somewhere in that document it says, "So what we need to do here is we need to exploit our engineering and our marketing so that we can deal with these things that we just identified," if you -- if that's in the document you can bring it out.

He can -- you know, and any conclusions that

they make and any statements they make, this is our purpose, this is why we're doing it, you know, the ruling is that's fair game.  Okay?

But his global conclusion that this is why they were doing what they were doing is what is not appropriate.

So to make myself clear, his -- his conclusion so they could exploit that in the engineering of their products and marketing, I think, violates the -- the pretrial rulings in this matter.

MR. SCHULTZ:  One other particular document I think you had in mind, Your Honor, a moment ago is a letter from George Weissman to the head of research for Philip Morris.  That's what he's referring to.

He said the company -- and, granted, I can't control all of that, but this is a letter from the man behind the marketing of Marlboro and the recreation of Marlboro to the research department saying they want flavor, they want a macho image; it's your job to take care of it.  Let's proceed is what he says.

So it is his opinion and it is supported by evidence.  We'll see later this morning that they used this research to -- Philip Morris used this research in the design and marketing of their

products.  They will absolutely see that this morning.

THE COURT:  And I'm telling you that I anticipate you're going to get that kind of stuff there.  It's just at this juncture, based upon the non-Philip Morris document, which was placed up there, the -- the ruling is that he can't, then, make that conclusion from it.

You may very well be able to -- to extract that conclusion from a later document that you introduced and the defendant's objection will be overruled if it's, in fact, the -- Philip Morris acknowledging this is what we're doing.  They're talking about their strategy; talking about their marketing; talking about why they're doing these sorts of things; trying to engineer the cigarette in such a way; the packaging in such a way that's going to be attractive to this younger audience.  That's all well and good.

I'm not familiar -- I -- I'm not remembering what that document was that you say that they say let's do this thing.

Weissman, vice president to Robert DuPuis, head of research where he says, I'm enclosing the Roper data.  The Roper data is valid.  We should proceed based on what we see there on the Roper data on the previous slide we need to reformulate Marlboro.  The marketing needs to be on a macho man cigarette and there needs to be an emphasis on flavor.  And flavor, of course, is the research end; the macho male part is on the marketing end.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  Close on your objection.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would ask that Your Honor tell the jury to disregard that last response from the witness.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Do you concur that he just represented to me that he's just introduced a Philip Morris document that goes to precisely this, that --that were studying why people were initiating cigarette smoking so that he could explore the engineering of their products and marketing with that document that he just --

MR. GERAGHTY:  There is a 1953 document where they took polling, and they decided to reposition Marlboro.  They wanted to make it a man's cigarette. They wanted to make it more flavorful.

But then the -- the -- the leap that that was done specifically to try to exploit young smokers to start smoking, that I vigorously disagree with.  And if there is a statement like that in the document, then I think Dr. Cummings and Mr. Schultz will show it, and the jury will -- you know, it'll speak for itself.

But I don't believe that the pejorative conclusion that Mr. Schultz says that document has is what anybody -- everybody who reads the document would come to that same conclusion, I don't believe that at all.

we have that Lamar Danielson began smoking as a teenager.

A.   Yes.  These are, you know, from the testimony that I reviewed from his high school friend, Mr. Pate, that, you know, recalled smoking with him around 1967 to '69 period, and -- and then his father, who had indicated that he could smell smoke on him during his high school years.

Q.   And based on what you've already talked about with the jury about this learning process or experimentation period, if Mr. Pate is right -- let's just take the middle number, 1968, the year that Lamar turns 14 going on 15.

A.   Right.

Q.   If he's smoking most all the time at high school age, does that give you any indication, based on your experience, as to whether he was smoking at an even younger age than that at some level?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I object.  That's assuming facts

not in evidence.

high school?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what is that?

A.   He was -- everybody said he was smoking, you know, Marlboro.

Q.   In fact, we have a slide on brand use.  I'll just ask you rather than going through it, Doctor. You've read all the testimony.

Is there anybody in this case who said that they ever saw Lamar Danielson smoke any brand of cigarettes other than Marlboro?

A.   No.

Q.   The heaviness of smoking, you talked about this a little bit earlier on, and we've talked about the fact that Mr. Danielson self-reported one to one and a half packs a day, smoked, according to his wife, Micah, two and a half to three packs later on.  Is that consistent with your reading of the evidence?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And then were there estimates in between?  Some people were at a pack, some people were at a pack and a half, some people were at two or more?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is that common when you're talking to people about recollections over a long period of time when

you're asking them many years later?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Smoked all the time, his son Billy said.  Becky Wiggins said he smoked two to three packs a day.  At least two packs a day from his coworker, Ms. Joyner.

Is that all in the evidence that you reviewed?

A.   Yes.  Ms. Joyner, I think, said two to three packs per day at least.  And I think she came to work, you know, with Mr. Danielson around 1983, early '80s period, so it would be after that time period she would be observing his smoking.  And she smoked at that time, so she sort of -- they smoked together.

Q.   And was she the one who was saving his Marlboro miles or UPC codes?  Ms. Joyner, that is.

A.   That's right.  In fact, I think there was even testimony that she had them in a spreadsheet and was keeping track of the miles.  So it was -- he was tracking the miles, they were sending him stuff, yeah.

Q.   First and last cigarette, you've already talked to the jury about the significance of time to first cigarette in the morning.  What does the evidence tell us in this case for Lamar specifically?

A.   Yeah, nobody had a stopwatch on him, but, you know, it was pretty clear from the testimony, and I rated it as -- scored him smoking first thing in the

morning based on the testimony that I reviewed, and these are just excerpts.

You know, he would sit up and light a cigarette before he got out of bed.  That's a pretty good indication.  Having -- his daughter said he would wake up and get a cigarette and go out on the porch to smoke before his shower.  So before you take the shower, you're smoking a cigarette.  Again, that would be an indication of first thing in the morning.

So by all indications -- and then his wife said he would have a cigarette sitting on the bed before he went to bed at night.

Q.   And what is -- you talked about the significance of the time to the first cigarette after the brain is deprived of nicotine.  What's the significance of smoking a cigarette very last thing before you lay down and go to sleep?

A.   Well, again, you're sort of dosing up before, because you go to bed and you're asleep six to eight hours.  You know, you've got to have your nicotine on board, so you -- that's why people tend to smoke a cigarette just before they go to bed at night.  And they have a cigarette first thing in the morning because they're deprived of nicotine.

So it's an indication of stronger dependence.

So if you smoke within about five minutes or so within waking up in the morning, that's a very strong indication of nicotine dependence.

Q.   And if we talk about Mr. Danielson's quits, you -- let me just ask you briefly, putting aside those -- I think you called them closet quits that family members might not know about, just based on the evidence in the case, do we have a firm number of how many times Mr. Danielson tried to quit smoking?

A.   I wouldn't say we have a firm number.  There's recollection of what appear to be separate times when he quit, and so there are multiple numbers of those, but we don't have a firm number.  I can't say he quit 20 times or two times at all.

Q.   The first bullet point mentions he was riding his bike in an attempt to quit smoking, and his mother-in-law, Lorraine Sanders, said that was before she quit in 1980.  But we have it on the slide that possible it's later.  Do you know what that refers to?

A.   Sure.  Because there's -- I think from -- his wife, Micah, talks about him also doing running and biking, and that's around in the late 1980s, probably around '86 or '87 time period from my read of the testimony.

So they could -- you know, yeah, people get

confused with dates. They sort of remember the events, because he's trying to do something else. In this case he was exercising a lot, running and biking.

Q.   And we have listed some of the quits out here. We know -- is it fair to say that we know, by 1986 or '87 he certainly has tried to quit smoking, given a sustained quit attempt? A.   Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object to the leading nature of all these questions. THE COURT:  Thank you.

More direct testimony from the witness and less from you would be helpful.  Thank you. MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And what sort of smoking cessation aids, if any, did Mr. Danielson use when he was trying to quit smoking, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Well, like many people, he used substitutes, like candy and mints were discussed, gum was discussed. There was also, I think, in the early '90s mention of a nicotine patch.

And then, you know, he's using, you know, other things.  He's doing other things like, you know, biking and -- and running and so on as a way of trying to not

smoke.

Q.   And do we have -- tell the jury, if you know, Dr. Cummings, when did nicotine patches become available?

A.   Nicotine patches were basically available around 1992.  Late December '92, I believe, is when they came in and then more available after that.  A prescription product, so you could only get it from the doctor.

Q.   And do we -- in the evidence are there different estimations of time, the duration of given quit attempts for Mr. Danielson?

A.   Yes.  You know, from a few days to up to, you know, months for some individuals.

Q.   I want to ask you, Dr. Cummings, about withdrawal and cravings, and specifically with respect to Mr. Danielson.

And can you explain or describe to the jury what we see on this particular slide?

A. Sure. This is basically, you know, when he was smoking, you know, just normal. Was fun, outgoing, very positive, you know, had a good disposition.

And people knew when he was quitting or was trying to refrain from smoking because there was a --fairly consistent across in a large number of people

deposed in this case who reported that he was, you know, a nervous wreck, he'd get irritable easily, a short fuse, ill-tempered, irritable, restless, nervous, you know.  He would come unglued easily.

So these are common indications of nicotine withdrawal that you would see in an addicted smoker, and they were certainly evident in the depositions that I reviewed.  I think weight gain was another thing that was mentioned as well.

Q.   And what for a smoker who is going through withdrawal is the easiest and quickest way to end the withdrawal?

A.   Well, light up a cigarette and the withdrawal goes away immediately.  You've refreshed the brain. Those receptors that are screaming out for nicotine --you know, just take a puff on a cigarette, and all of a sudden you feel normal again.

So that's why withdrawal tends to be a trigger for people going back to smoking.  And I think that actually one of the incidents from his coworker described the fact that his -- his younger -- his daughter gave her lunch money to her dad because he was so irritable and so -- here, go buy cigarettes.  And he ended up going back to smoking.  And he said -- "I guess I'm doomed to be a smoker," I think was the comment from

Mrs. Joyner.

Q.   Well, let me ask you about, not that particular incident, but let me ask you this:  Does rationalization of smoking for most addicted smokers enter into the picture once they're into this sort of red end, if you will, of this process?

A.   Sure.  I mean, now is not a good time to quit. I can do it maybe next week.

And so people give themselves an excuse to have that just one cigarette, and then they're right back into it.  And so denial and rationalization of both the health risks and then dealing with withdrawal are one of the reasons that people find it hard to overcome addiction.  It's common to all drug addictions.  And certainly with nicotine addiction, it's reflected in the experience that others around Lamar Danielson were noticing.

Q.   And if you would, Dr. Cummings, can you tell the jury what document this is -- the document specifically LP0074, "Exit Brand Cigarettes:  A Study of Ex-Smokers," what this document is?

A.   Sure.  This is a study by Frank Ryan, and he's looking at what brands people smoke before they quit, so the exit brand, which is -- you know, gives you the title.

This is actually contained in one of the annual reports that are put out by the research and development program at Reynolds, and Frank Ryan worked in the behavioral science program.  And he's basically explaining in the introduction to this study, you know, why people smoke.

You know, they're considered nicotine seekers for the pharmacologic effects of nicotine and that one of the reasons that the people end up going back to smoking is they miss that effect, the pharmacologic reward, and they end up returning to smoking, just like what happened to Lamar Danielson.  That's in 1978.

Q.   And I want to ask for a moment, Dr. Cummings, about the distribution.  Is F. Resnik Mr. Frank Resnik --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- from Philip Morris?

How about R. Seligman, is that Robert Seligman?

A.   Yes.  I mean, these are high-level executives at Philip Morris.  Dr. Seligman was the vice president at Philip Morris.  Tom Osdene was the director of research at Philip Morris at the time in 1978, so he sort of oversaw this program.  And then you have various people who were involved in this program.  You know, Carolyn Levy did the -- led the animal nicotine

self-administration research.

MR. GERAGHTY:  This is no longer responsive to

the question, Your Honor.  I move to strike. THE COURT:  Thank you. I'd like a little more questioning than the

narrative responses.  Thank you. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, who was Frank Galioto with Philip Morris?  Or let me ask you this question:  Is he somebody down in the -- doing benchwork in the chemistry department, or is he a higher-up within the company?

A.   Well, he's a higher up in the company, but he's also in the research and development section.

Q.   How about -- is Dr. C. Levy Carolyn Levy?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And who was Carolyn Levy?

A.   Well, as I described, she started out doing the animal program, leading that program.  She eventually became the brand manager for Marlboro, so one of the most senior positions at Philip Morris.

Q.   And we have a slide, Dr. Cummings, on some miscellaneous facts pertaining to Mr. Danielson's smoking.

His neighbor, Rickey Stokes, said, "After quitting, he said he could eat a cigarette."

What is the significance of that to you?

A.   Well, he's still, you know, craving a cigarette.  And not common for people after they finally stop to notice that they still have urges to smoke. Despite, you know, the fact that he quit after his cancer diagnosis, he's still feeling like he could eat a cigarette.

Q.   And is that when that occurred, Doctor, after the diagnosis?

A.   That's right.

Q.   "He would get up during a movie to smoke a cigarette," said his wife, Ms. Danielson. What's the significance of that?

A.   Well, again, somebody who is nicotine dependent needs to have their nicotine hit.  And, you know, in the movies you can't smoke.  So, you know, a lot of smokers will just get up in the middle of the movie, go outside, grab a cigarette, and -- and then come back in to watch the movie.

So it's showing it's disrupting your normal activities.  Again, an indication of stronger dependence.

Q.   And how about the fact that he bought cigarettes two to three cartons at a time, according to his sister-in-law?

A.   Right.  And there was other evidence as well on buying by cartons.

I mean, somebody who is a heavy smoker -- you know, it's more expensive to buy them a pack at a time. So if you could buy them by the carton, that's an indication that somebody tends to be a heavier smoker.

Q.   And "Allowed to smoke frequently in many locations at work."

Why is that significant in terms of the addiction opinions, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Well, he -- you know, there -- there were really no restrictions on his smoking, until later in time, at work.  So he could pretty much smoke throughout the day.

So if you can smoke throughout the day, you tend to smoke more cigarettes.  And by all indications, he was a pretty heavy smoker.

Q.   And, finally, "Participated in the Marlboro Red merchandising program."

What is the significance of that, Dr. Cummings?

A. Well, it's -- you know, there's a couple of --one is your loyalty to Marlboro if you're participating in the Marlboro loyalty or Marlboro miles program.

Secondly, it's an indication that Philip Morris had the opportunity to communicate directly to

Mr. Danielson and had the opportunity, because they were communicating directly with Mr. Danielson, to tell him anything they wanted.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I -- I would object at this point.

Can we approach?

THE COURT:  Yes.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MR. GERAGHTY: We -- we've been talking about issues relevant to whether or not Mr. Danielson is addicted.

Now, this last item, "Participated in Marlboro Red merchandising program," what Dr. Cummings was about to say -- he said this in his deposition. He's going to say, "Well, I think" --

is, "Well, this is relevant as far as I'm concerned because -- because he signed up to be -- to receive direct mail from Philip Morris, and that meant that Philip Morris had an opportunity to speak to him directly and tell him smoking causes lung cancer, smoking causes all these diseases, and they didn't do it."

Your Honor, that's his personal opinion.  He went off in his deposition about how he thinks direct marketing by cigarette companies is terrible, and they shouldn't do it when they make an addictive and dangerous product.

That's a personal opinion.  It's not relevant to any of the particular issues in this case.  It's certainly not relevant to whether or not Mr. Danielson was addicted.  That's what we've been talking about.

He gave this criteria of the relevant factors for addiction.  This particular item is not on that list.  This is just an opportunity for him to go off on soliloquy, if you will, about his views about the fact that he doesn't think it's appropriate that Philip Morris engages in direct marketing.

But that's not relevant to any of the claims in the case.

Okay.  We're going to -- we'll take ten minutes right now.  It should give everybody an opportunity.

Heaviness of Smoking Index.

Did you, taking into account all the evidence we've talked about, actually score Mr. Danielson on the HIS?

A.   I did.

Q.   Can you walk the jury through that, please.

A.   Sure.  I scored him a -- you know, a -- the highest category on the time to first cigarette within five minutes, he got three points.  And I was conservative because of the range of, you know, reports on his smoking anywhere from a pack to three packs, so being conservative I gave him a C.

The third category for amount smoked only two points, but there is evidence that he was smoking more than 31 cigarettes a day at certain points during his life.

So he's either a five or six.  It really didn't matter if we put him into the highest category of dependence, which is where I would place it based on my review.

Q.   And so we're clear, Dr. Cummings, is 21 to 30 cigarettes -- how many is that in terms of packs?

A.   Basically a pack to a pack and a half.  So 20 cigarettes in a pack, so it's over a pack a day because you're 21 to 30, so pack and a half per day.

Q.   Is the Heaviness of Smoking Index the metric or the assessment tool for addiction that you use in your work?

A.   Yes.  It's the way we screen smokers at MUSC, so every patient who comes in gets scored on the Heaviness of Smoking Index if they're a persistent daily user.

Similarly, when I was at the New York State --ran that quit line.  That's how we screen people in terms of dependence and how we would tailor the treatments accordingly.

Q.   And has the HSI, Dr. Cummings, through peer research and study, been validated as reliable and predictive?

A.   Yes, it has.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we pull up LP0902. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

does Philip Morris in this 2003 publication,

Dr. Cummings, also talk about indications of addiction?

A.   Yes.  This is a guide written by Philip Morris, and they provide criteria for judging whether somebody -- in this case, they're talking about whether you're a child who might be smoking -- is addicted or not.

And so they provide, you know, essentially a little three-item test or criteria here, where they say, you know, take a deep breath.  Now ask your child about his smoking.  How long has it been -- how long has he been smoking?

And there's a chance that if your child has been smoking for a while, he may be addicted.  Ask about some of the symptoms of nicotine addiction.

First, you know, have you tried to quit but couldn't?

Second, do you ever have strong cravings to smoke?

And third, do you have trouble concentrating or feel cranky, restless, nervous or anxious when you can't smoke?

And fourth, have you tried to go without smoking but have failed?

questions, he may be addicted.

Q.   And let me ask you based on the evidence we've already reviewed, Dr. Cummings, did Mr. Danielson try to quit but found that he couldn't?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did you see evidence of strong cravings to smoke?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did he have -- is there evidence that he had trouble concentrating, fuzzy-headed when he was quitting smoking?

A.   Yes.  It just showed a slide that summarized that evidence, yes.

Q.   And evidence that he was cranky or restless or nervous when he stopped smoking?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And did he try to go without smoking but failed?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So the answer -- would the answer as to Mr. Danielson to any or all of these be yes?

A.   They would be -- I would assess yes to all of them; but, you know, as they indicate in -- as Philip Morris has said, if you answer yes to any of these, could be addicted.  He clearly was addicted.  There

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we go back to the slide presentation? BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   I want to shift gears a little bit, Dr. Cummings, and -- you've talked about addiction.  I want to talk about addiction and how it causes disease.

You have a slide that says, "Nicotine dependency through cigarette smoking is not only the most common form of drug addiction, but the one that causes more death and disease than all other addictions combined."

How do you know that? A.   Well, when you look at the prevalence of people who are addicted to various substances from, you know, alcohol to heroin, cocaine, opiates, and you look at the percentage of people or the number of people that have that addiction and you compare them to the number of people who are persistent daily smokers in the population, there are many more people who are addicted to nicotine in cigarettes than there are to these other substances.

That doesn't diminish the importance of being addicted to those other substances; it just -- they don't affect as many people.  And when you look at the

number of diseases, more people die from smoking every day than all those other addictive substances combined.

So cigarettes are, you know, basically responsible for killing one out of two long-term users. It's what the estimates are.

Q.   And I want to ask specifically, Dr. Cummings, about the role that addiction plays in that and this is a slide the jury actually I think saw in opening.

Can you describe for them what this slide is depicting?

A.   Sure.  It's got Lamar's smoking pattern.  He's a pack and a half or more per day smoker.  Tells you the number of cigarettes per day.  On average, I think the Surgeon General's Report says 11 puffs on a cigarette; but, again, there are different lengths of cigarettes and so on, so I said ten is just an easier number.

But ten puffs per cigarette would give you the number of exposures smoking a pack and a half per day for the number of years that he was a smoker.  That's a lot of exposures because every puff on a cigarette exposes your body to about 9,000 chemicals.  About 60 of those chemicals are known cancer-causing chemicals.

Every puff does your cells damage. They do DNA damage. When you overwhelm the repair mechanism, that's when we see the cancers.

Compare that to somebody who is a social smoker, smoking about a pack a month, so this is not on a daily basis.

So not all smokers are persistent daily smokers, but about 85 to 90 percent of the population is.  But there are about 10 to 15 percent who -- we call them the weekend warriors that -- they don't smoke every day and they don't seem to be smoking for the physiological effects of addiction; it's more for social reasons that they smoke.

Their exposures are a lot less and they find it much easier to just walk away from cigarettes.  So they have more of a free choice compared to somebody like Lamar Danielson.

Q.   And you mentioned 85 to 90 percent of the population smoked on an addictive basis.  I'm summarizing.

Were you referring to the smoking population --A.   Yes. Q.   -- when you said -- um...

Are there other factors, whether it's, you know, metabolism, social settings, what have you, that -- that can contribute to smoking even in addictive smokers, other than the addiction itself?

A.   Sure.  I mean, there are -- I mean, nicotine is

the primary thing, but there are other factors that, you know, trigger -- you know, lighting up a cigarette, patterns of the day.  You get in the car.  A lot of people smoke in the car so that's one of their triggers. Or a cup of coffee will be a trigger for them to smoke.

And a lot of these become learned associations, so, you know, they begin to pair certain things.  Seeing other people smoke.  Seeing their pack of cigarettes right there.  Seeing advertisements.  It can be a trigger for people to light up a cigarette.

So there are a lot of things that are associated and become associated with somebody's addictive smoking pattern, but the over -- you can eliminate that by, you know, basically removing the nicotine.  Those other factors fade away quickly.

Q.   And does addiction, even in light of those factors, Dr. Cummings, with an addicted smoker still act, in your opinion, as a substantial contributing factor to the disease that comes about as a result of heavy smoking?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object. Lack of qualifications.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, absolutely.  Nicotine addiction is, you know, the fundamental reason that

somebody persists in exposing themselves to the harmful chemicals in cigarettes for, you know, years and decades to the point that they get sick.  Be it not for nicotine addiction, people might experiment with it.  They might try it, but they wouldn't persist in doing it for decades or they get sick. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   I want to show another Philip Morris document, Dr. Cummings.  Can you -- are -- first of all, LP0067 is the exhibit number.

Can you tell the jury about this document and what it's describing?

A.   Sure.  It's written by Bill Dunn to Tom Osdene. Bill Dunn runs the behavioral research program at Philip Morris.  Tom Osdene at the time was his boss, R&D director, and he's describing the smoker psychology program and the, you know, basic models that are guiding the research within their laboratory, all the studies that they're doing.

He basically talks about operant conditioning as the basic paradigm by which people smoke and he gives the analogy here that the rat will soon -- if you pair the -- a reward with, you know, a behavior, you'll reinforce the behavior.

So, you know, he's describing in their animal

studies the rat will soon associate lever-pushing with the food pellet, the food pellet in this case being the reward.  In time he will rapidly be pushing the lever for food.  This is the paradigm of operant conditioning and the rewarding stimulus reinforces the operant behavior.  The lever-pressing, you get.

And so he goes on in this document where he's sort of explained the general theory of operant conditioning and then consider the smoker.

He said, "Smoking a cigarette is the lever press.  The effect of the smoking act upon the person is the reward.  That effect reinforces the smoking act.  He comes to push the lever ten to 60 times per day.  Our task is to understand the reinforcing mechanism, or process, whereby the habit is established and maintained."  And such is our model.

And he goes on further to talk about, you know, the research and identifying the key reward in cigarettes, specifically the chemical constituent that's involved and what would happen if that chemical constituent were removed.

Q.   Was Mr. Dunn -- we see Bill Dunn's name up here returned to Dr. Osdene.

Were these both gentlemen who were higher up in the company?

A.   Yes, they were.

MR. SCHULTZ:  So let's look at Page 5, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, I think that was what you were referring to.

A.   Without the chemical compound -- right towards the bottom two-thirds of the way down, without -- keep going down.  Yeah, there you go.  The last sentence there.

Q.   Without the chemical compound the cigarette market would collapse, PM would collapse, and we'd all lose our jobs and our consulting fees.  Does he go on to ask what might that compound be?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the conclusion -- is there a conclusion in this document as to what it might be?

A.   Well, they talk about various things, but he, you know, points out that, you know, nicotine could be that chemical compound.  "Is nicotine the chemical in compound X?"

And certainly that was the focus of their research.  It was on nicotine as the key component of their product.  And then they -- if they determine that, then the next question becomes, you know, what is the lower delivery level limit beyond which the smoking act is not reinforced?  How low do you go?

Q.   Does that mean, Doctor, how low can we take nicotine but still keep people smoking on an addictive basis?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is now asking

the meaning and intent of the document beyond what

the language itself says.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, wait, if we go back, Ryan,

I think the bottom of Page 5. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q. "What is the lower delivery level limit beyond which the smoking act is not reinforced?" Is that what you were just describing?

A.   Yes, it is.

Q.   And when you read lower delivery level limit, do you read that to refer to component X?

A.   That's what they said, yes.  "Is nicotine component X?"  For much of our research, we beg that question.  And we proceed with, "If so, what is the lower delivery level limit of nicotine beyond which the smoking act is not reinforced?"

Q.   And we had already seen, Doctor, documents from two years before this where Mr. Wakeham said, "People smoke to get nicotine"; is that right?

A. Pharmacologic effects of cigarettes, yes. And in 1974 he specifically says nicotine.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, under the rule of

completeness, could I read a very short passage from

the document?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Sure.

objection, then simply provide it to the witness to read.

MR. SCHULTZ: He asked me to provide it to the witness. Why don't we pull it up on the screen. I don't have any objection.

THE COURT:  Yes.  That would be fine, if we can do it that way.

MR. SCHULTZ:  What page are you on? MR. GERAGHTY:  It's Page 7, the bottom of Page 7, the paragraph from the previously numbered bullets. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, "Many of these questions we are not qualified to try to answer, and there are other constraints, noninvasive, nonobtrusive, and ethics." Did I read that correctly? A.   You did.

Q.   Did, in your review of the documents, ethics get in the way of Philip Morris' study of nicotine over Lamar Danielson's lifetime?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object. This is now calling for meaning and intent beyond the document.

THE COURT: I'm going to sustain the objection to that question.  Thank you.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Well, let me go back to the question I asked before, Doctor.  Two years before this, did -- let me preface that with this question:  Who was Helmut Wakeham with respect to Mr. Osdene or Mr. Dunn?

A.   Well, he was the -- he was the boss for both Dr. Osdene and -- and Dr. Dunn.

Q.   And was it the boss, Dr. Wakeham, who said people smoke to get nicotine two years before this document came out?

A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you.  If we can go back,

please, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   They talked about the effect, reinforcing the smoking act, is that, Dr. Cummings, the same explanation or similar to the explanation you were giving the jury a few moments ago, based on your own research, on the difference between social smokers and addicted smokers?

A.   Yes.  The addicted smoker is smoking for the drug reinforcement of nicotine, and the social smoker is smoking for social environmental cues.  It's not drug reinforced.

And there are differences between social smokers and addicted smokers that are probably biologic.

Some people are more susceptible to be addicted to a substance and others are not, which explains why some people can get away being social smokers.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, is wanting to smoke different from needing to smoke?

A.   Yes.  Wanting to smoke is choosing, that's more of the social smoker; whereas needing to smoke is the addicted smoker.  Needing is when you need to have the drug to feel normal, and that happens when somebody falls into that persistent daily basis.

You can measure how dependent they are based on the Heaviness of Smoking Index and reflects the extent to which your, you know, free choice to walk away from doing that behavior is constrained.

Q.   Now, on this slide, are we talking about -- are you describing the person who needs to smoke, a choice constrained by addiction?

A.   Yeah, we're talking about if somebody is addicted, their choice is constrained.  That is the definition of addiction.  If, you know, somebody is addicted, their choices are constrained.  They have to overcome their addiction.

It's not easy to do, and their brain has been altered.  That's the definition.  You know, it's a chronic relapsing brain disease.

And that substantially contributes to, as I've mentioned a number of times, the exposures to cigarette toxins that you get in every puff of the cigarette.  And it's those exposures day in and day out, year in and year out, that contribute to, you know, people getting smoking-related diseases like lung cancer.

Q.   And if you take, Dr. Cummings, this phrase "constrained by addiction" out of the equation -- you take "addiction" out of the equation, do you still have the same process:  Choice leads to exposure to toxins leads to smoking-related disease?

A.   No.  Nobody is choosing to get lung cancer. It's not -- not something people freely choose to do. They are stuck as a drug addiction.

But if you took, you know, the constrained addiction out of the equation, most smokers would quit if they could.

And the fact of the matter is most smokers find it hard to stop, so they end up in this denial rationalization and trying to quit and failing, and many people end up in the same circumstance that Mr. Danielson had ended up in.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, does this process that you're describing on the slide, does this happen repeatedly over a number of years with a smoker like

Lamar Danielson?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And would you say it's a natural, continuous sequence?

A.   Yes.  The more exposure, the greater the risk of developing disease.  So, you know, you look at duration and dose of exposure to the harmful chemicals that relate to the disease, so that's why we see most of the diseases associated with smoking, virtually all of the chronic diseases in addicted smokers who have long-term history of smoking and heavily smoking.

Q.   And you've already told us, Dr. Cummings, enjoyment, relaxation, and other factors may enter the picture here.

Does that change this process in terms of the contribution addiction makes?

A.   No.  As I said before, enjoyment, relaxation from smoking is one of the things that people who are addicted to smoking will talk about.  It's actually talking about the physiological effects of nicotine in an addicted smoker.

So that -- it's -- it's just another indicator of addiction.  But, I mean, again, I use the Heaviness of Smoking Index because that's the strongest indication of how strongly somebody is addicted to nicotine.

Q.   And I want to shift gears again, Dr. Cummings, and -- and talk a little bit.  We've already talked about Lamar Danielson's age at initiation.

By the way, before I do that, the last response that you gave, I asked you sort of generally as to addicted smokers.  Would that response apply to Lamar Danielson in your opinion, specifically?

A.   Yes.

Q.   We've already talked about the age at which Mr. Danielson started smoking.

Are these some opinions that you hold in terms of the importance or significance of youth smoking?

A.   Yes.  I mean, if you can keep people from starting to smoke to begin with, through their teenage years, they're unlikely to take up smoking.

And so if they're not smoking, we're not going to see the diseases that are so strongly related to cigarette smoking as a result.

Earlier onset, I talked about, is part of the process of drug addiction.  The earlier the developing brain is exposed to an addictive substance, the more you're going to see those changes in the brain, new receptors in the brain, the disconnection between the reward center and where you make rational choices and the executive function part of the brain.

And those come -- those are impaired in addicted individuals.  And that's more -- that's truer in, you know, people who start at an earlier age, so it leads to a stronger addiction, greater duration of use. And so that's -- that's what the science shows us today.  So prevention of exposing anybody to an addictive substance is really important.  You really don't make smart choices until your brain is sort of fully mature and developed.  And, you know, the brain is still developing up to age 25.

Q.   We've looked a couple of times, Doctor, at the 2003 Philip Morris document on youth smoking.

In this portion of it, they mention that the younger people are when they start smoking, the more likely they are to become strongly addicted to nicotine. Is that consistent with what you just told the jury your opinion is?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And symptoms of addiction, having strong urges to smoke, feeling anxious or irritable, or having unsuccessfully tried not to smoke, can appear in teens and preteens within weeks or only days after they've become occasional smokers.  Would that also be consistent with your opinion?

A.   Yes.  It's really picking up that period

from -- you know, in experimentation where they're experimental smokers, but those symptoms tend to be more common in people who cross over to become, you know, daily smokers.

Q.   Would that have been true back in the 1960s, as it is in 2003?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And finally, it says, "If you can prevent teens from smoking in high school, chances are greater they won't smoke as adults."  You told the jury that.

How many people, just a rough estimate, begin smoking after the age of 21?  Become regular smokers, I should say.

A.   Become regular smokers?

Q.   Yes.

A.   After the age of 21, it's very rare.  It's probably under 10 percent.

Q.   I want to look, Dr. Cummings -- we have a couple of minutes -- a 1970 document from Philip Morris, LP0044 is the exhibit number, entitled "Suggestions for Research to Answer Questions Raised on Philip Morris Benchmark Study."

Can you tell the jury, first of all, what is Philip Morris' benchmark study in 1970?

A.   Well, Philip Morris was tracking their, you

know, sales among, you know, a random sample of the population.  And so they were -- you know, what percentage of smokers are smoking Marlboro or, you know, Camel or Winston or whatever, and they're tracking their brand sales.

And, you know, Marlboro was doing very well at this time in 1970, but they were actually underestimating the true impact.  They sort of knew how many cigarettes they were selling versus what they were estimating those sales would be from their benchmark study, and there was actually an underestimate.

So Mr. Cullman, who was president of the company, said, "We're missing" -- you know, "We have this gap.  We think we have a significant share." Because the benchmark study was originally -- only included adults, 18 and over.

And so this proposal is how they could, you know, fill in this gap and get a better, more precise, estimate of their total sales.  And they're talking about, you know, how to reach teenagers.  Also excluded from the benchmark study were people in the military.

Q.   Let me ask you this, Dr. Cummings, is Mr. Fountaine in Philip Morris' marketing department?

A.   Yes, he is.

Q.   And Shirley Wilkins and Bud Roper, who were

they with?

A.   Well, Bud Roper is the Roper Polling Firm, and they did work for Philip Morris dating back into the '50s, and really consistently throughout this period they did their benchmark studies.

And they're basically talking to them about a proposal to fill in this gap that Mr. Cullman had noticed between the benchmark estimates of Marlboro sales versus what more precisely was tracking their sales.

Q.   And I think you've told the jury, was Mr. Cullman the president of Philip Morris at the time?

A.   At the time he was, yeah.

Q.   And the document goes on.  There are three --this is the same document, Dr. Cummings?

A.   That's right.

Q.   There are three groups where smoker percentages in Marlboro shares need to be checked:  college students living on campus, young people in the 14 to 17 age group, and men in the military.

Let me ask you, first of all, in 1970, with Lamar Danielson being born in 1953, how old would he be?

A.   1970, 17.

Q.   16 turning 17?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   So would he be in the age group they're talking about, the president of Philip Morris at the time?

A.   Yes, he would.

Q.   Was he a Marlboro smoker at the time?

A.   He was.

Q.   Young people 14 to 17, you mentioned that to get reading on the smoker percentage of Marlboro share among teenagers not covered in the benchmark study, they should -- they recommend interviewing young people at summer recreation centers, beaches, public pools, lakes, et cetera.  They go on to explain the low at-homeness of this group combined with their incidence in households would make house-to-house interviewing quite expensive. In addition, true answers on smoking habits might be difficult to elicit in the presence of parents.

I think you just explained, Dr. Cummings, why they were interested in having Roper go out and interview teenagers; correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   So was it correct when -- was it to correct this disparity they saw between what Roper was talking about in their sales and what they knew their sales were?

A.   That's right.

asked you to provide to me that I had not yet had an opportunity to resolve.  And I've got those before me at this time.

One of them I've already addressed.  And I'm sorry, I don't remember the number of that.  That's the -- the Curtis Judge, T.L. Achey.

MR. GERAGHTY:  That's 501, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GERAGHTY:  0501.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

Next, I have a document, which is to C.I. McCarty from Ernest Pepples, dated June 18, 1981.  It's a memorandum.

Which number is that?

MR. SCHULTZ:  LP2036, Your Honor.  That was � that's the 1963 document?  Or the...

THE COURT:  1981 is what it looks like.

MR. GERAGHTY:  6202. (Pause.)

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm sorry, Judge.  I don't have that, but I'm -- I'm not going to try and stop from proceeding.  I can -- I think I would know the document.

THE COURT:  It's a memorandum.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Ah.  I do have it.

MR. SCHULTZ:  -- 38.

THE COURT:  -- 38?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So those are the documents that we need to address.

I've already addressed LP0501.

If you have a preference, fine; if not, we'll just start with the last one I mentioned, LP2638. LP2638.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And you want to hear the objection or the --

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is a document from, I believe, the American Tobacco Company.

It's not from Philip Morris.

And there's absolutely no evidence that it's a document that was ever transmitted or communicated in any way to Philip Morris.

There is nothing in the document that would give any indication that it's in furtherance of the agreement to conceal information on the health risks or addictive nature of smoking.

So we would object on hearsay, relevance, and 403 grounds.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I guess this document, Judge,

would have judicial relevance.  I've yet to be in one of these trials where defense didn't cross-examine Dr. Cummings on Silvette, Larson, and Haag, "The Green Monster," as they call it.  And this document is a 1941 American Tobacco Company document showing that Mr. Larson and Mr. Haag have been on the American Tobacco Company's payroll since the 1940s.

I believe -- and I looked for the quote.  I didn't see it -- yes, here it is -- that they say they are "sold American," which is, of course, a tobacco auction reference, but they're using it, I think, as a cheeky reference to say that they've got these guys in their pocket.

If we see Sylvette, Larson, and Haag, I intend to show the jury, if I'm permitted, that these men were "sold American" 20 years before that book every came out.

It does also connect to a slide that we have in our conspiracy presentation where we talked briefly about knowledge coming into the conspiracy of all the conspirators:  Philip Morris, American, Brown & Williamson, and R.J. Reynolds.  I don't think we mentioned Lorillard.

But in there, that includes a deposition

excerpt from Dr. Haag given in 1959 in the Green case where he said, "I've been talking with American Tobacco Company about cigarette smoking and lung cancer for 25 years," which takes it all the way back to 1934.

And the purpose of that information, Judge, is to show the jury that, at the time the conspiracy is conformed, each one of these companies independently has been at least following the literature, if not already concluded internally, that smoking causes lung cancer.

That is the knowledge brought into the conspiracy.  So this connects to that in that way as well.

THE COURT:  It would seem to me that one of the things this document does is it talks about a plan by which they would fund, at the University of Virginia, this biological research; and that they had found this splendid young doctor who they --they thought would fit very well; and that -- that by letting -- by making a grant to the university, they could distance themselves from his hire and --and, if needed, any of his comments; and that they then, if they felt like after a year he had not produced for them in the way that they were

desirous, that they would terminate -- his services could be terminated by the university and -- and keep them out of the loop; and that it was to be confidential so that the -- nobody, you know, unless they chose to make it public so that -- if it had a benefit; and that the -- that the motive -- the essential motive behind it was to persuade medical professionals; and that they weren't as easily persuaded by chemical analysis as they would be by biological analysis.

So that -- that's the sum total of it.

So if this happened after 1953, it would be certainly, absolutely on all fours, something that would be right square in the middle of this conspiracy.  Unless it's -- unless Larson was brought up, as -- as you suggest, that there --there is going to be some effort to impeach this witness through the use of "The Green Monster" or use of any of Larson documents or these -- the other folks' documents, then this would have diminished utility because it really doesn't say anything about the kind of biological information they had or knew. It was just talking about their motives, about how they're going to do it, which were -- actually turned out to be similar to the motives that -- of

the plan hatched in -- in the early '50s.  But it --it -- you know, which was over a decade later.

So from my standpoint, unless and until that door is opened, then it has a lesser utility.  If that door is opened and Larson is presented as being some sort of independent scientist or his tone is presented as being some sort of work of independent neutral significance, it really doesn't have any utility.

But if he is presented otherwise or if he is presented that way, then this otherwise has great utility in basically going to reflect that he was hand-picked by the tobacco industry and set up in a way that he could be distanced from any attribution to the tobacco industry.

So from that standpoint, at this point in time, I would sustain the objection unless the door is opened to Larson.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Understood, Your Honor.

MR. SCHULTZ:  This is precisely one of the documents I just described a moment ago, Your Honor. This is an American Tobacco Company document from 1939.  It is preconspiracy.

But it is -- the purpose for the document --and this will come up in the conspiracy failure, I'll be honest.  It will come up today.

What we've got is Dr. Hiram Hanmer, who was the director of research for American Tobacco Company, as indicated, is writing to a Dr. Free.  We've actually used this in a previous trial, where Dr. Proctor put that in context of who Dr. Free was.

It's not as important here who the recipient is.  The important quote, and what we're using it for, is to show they have been following Roffo's work for some time.

Dr. Roffo, as the Court may well know after the O'Hara trial, was an early cancer researcher who was dedicated to publishing in the area of the potential harms of smoking or tars, particularly from cigarettes.  This is one of probably four or five documents that we use in succession to show that, coming into the conspiracy, the industry has been following the cancer literature.

We have a 1936 document from Philip Morris that

shows they're following Roffo's work.

This shows American Tobacco Company is following Roffo's work.

Mr. -- Dr. Haag says he's been talking with Hiram Hanmer, the same gentleman at American Tobacco, all the way back in the '30s about smoking and cancer.

We have a '52 Brown & Williamson document.

None of which has been objected to, or at least objections have been sustained on, showing that they found benzopyrene in their smoke.

And then we have '53 R.J.R. document where Claude Teague concludes that the evidence is strong linking cancer and smoking.

All of that, Judge, is to show -- is relevant evidence to show the knowledge coming into the conspiracy in 1953; otherwise, I believe we'll hear we haven't shown that, until X date or Y date, the first document that we have after the conspiracy, that anyone knew anything about what they were covering up.  Well, it seems obvious, and there is some case law, although I didn't find any in Florida specifically, that says that events which occurred prior to the commission of a conspiracy are relevant to understanding the nature of the conspiracy

itself.

That was a lot of explaining because it will come up in other documents.  But that is where this document fits into that picture, Your Honor.  And it's put in for that specific purpose.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I'll be brief.  For the same reasons you excluded the last document this one ought to be excluded.  The date is 1939.  So it's 14, 15 years before the conspiracy started here.

It is an American Tobacco Company document. Again, no -- it was never transmitted, communicated to Philip Morris in any way.

Just to very briefly address what Mr. Schultz said.  They're going to show public newspaper articles and studies that were published in the early 1950s, and we're not going to stand up and say Philip Morris didn't know about the mouse skin painting study in 1953.  Philip Morris didn't know about the other work that Wynder and Graham were doing.  Philip Morris didn't know about the work that was being done in England by Bradford Hill.

These documents don't have any independent relevance.  There will be evidence, I'm sure,

separate and apart from this document that anybody would have been aware of the studies that were coming out in the early 1950s; and I said that in my opening statement so this should be excluded.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

With regard to this, I think you've told me that Philip Morris itself has documentation addressing Roffo's conclusions, and debunking any sort of significance to those conclusions.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Not debunking, just showing that they're following his work back in the 1930s; so, therefore, they know at least what the literature is saying about smoking and cancer well before they formed this conspiracy.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Which is essentially what this says, too --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes.

THE COURT:  -- to another company.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Correct.

THE COURT:  And it seems to me if you've got it covered it might be cumulative of that, and more direct evidence of it if you've got a Philip Morris document on it than this.

benefit the defendant more than the plaintiff; and, you know, it seems more con- -- confusing.

You know, I see for the position that they were following him.  They weren't just simply head in the sand about, you know, potential medical issues around the 1939 time frame.  They literally were following.

If you've got Philip Morris in another document saying that, then I would prefer you use that document.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Understood, Judge.  We have Philip Morris saying Philip Morris was following it, not American Tobacco was following it.  And, of course, our point is the whole conspiracy came together for a purpose.

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And if Philip Morris -- we showed Philip Morris, well, that's fine on a concealment case; it doesn't do a whole lot for the conspiracy if the jury doesn't see that the other co-conspirators were also following the same work.

not going to -- I don't see that as being a problem.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I should in good faith, Your Honor, point out, as I have, I have a much closer in time 1952 Brown & Williamson document where they're not just following; they've identified benzopyrene as a carcinogen in the condensate of their smoke.  And the '53 document, I'm sure you saw in O'Hara from Claude Teague called A Survey of Cancer Research that I intend to use for the same purpose.

At the very least, they're a lot less remote and -- but I could understand and see how they would be subject to the same ruling.  Our argument would be they're very relevant to show during this time frame.  It's not just --

THE COURT:  Well, these are the ones that I'm dealing with.  These are the ones objected to.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.

THE COURT:  I'm not dealing with things -- I'm going through these things right now one at a time. And I'm dealing with the objections that have been made and I'm making rulings.

On this one, likewise, I would rule that the objection would be sustained, unless the door is opened for some reason.

I've got 2036.  Objection?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is a 1963 internal document from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company to British American Tobacco.  And it really deals, mainly, with the design of Brown & Williamson cigarettes.  And it's sort of a recitation by a --Mr. Griffith here to Mr. Kirwin about the sorts of things that they're exploring, the things they can do.  It does talk about flue-cured tobacco.

There's a provocative sentence that I know they like to use on Page 4 in the carry-over paragraph. They say, "I think that we can say now that we can regulate fairly precisely the nicotine and sugar levels almost any desire level management might require."

But this is an internal document, again, not transmitted to Philip Morris, not communicated to Philip Morris.  It's not discussing the health risks of smoking.  It's not discussing the potential addictive nature of smoking.

I don't think there is any fair reading of this document where anyone could conclude that it's a document that was written in furtherance of the agreement to conceal in this particular case.  It is all about how Brown & Williamson is talking about

designing their own cigarettes.  None of which were smoked by Mr. Danielson in this case.

So we would object as hearsay, relevance, 403, lack of foundation.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I overrule the objection.

Looking now at LP0415.  Objection?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I won't take long.  It's a 1980 document -- internal R.J. Reynolds document about their understanding of Marlboro's share among people 14 to 17 years old.

Again, this document was not created as part of a so-called agreement to conceal.  It's a Reynolds document.  It's hearsay and 403, Your Honor, so we would -- we would move to exclude this document.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll overrule the objection and it would be admissible.

Those are the documents that I had.

Was I supposed to have another one?

MR. SCHULTZ:  There was 6202, Judge.  No, we talked about that first, I guess.

I think that's it, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Yeah, I think so.

Anything else we need to address during the break before we go to lunch?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Not from the plaintiff, Judge.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor --

THE COURT:  Yes, sir.

MR. GERAGHTY:  -- I've been given a hand -- a set of slides.  I don't believe these were all slides that Mr. Schultz intends to use.  I think they're supposed to take us to some point in the examination.  I've only been able to look at what he's given me thus far.  There's one or two.

May I just approach and show Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. GERAGHTY:  One of the videotapes that plaintiff wants to show at some point I assume in the afternoon is a --

THE COURT:  Thank you.

MR. GERAGHTY:  You're welcome, Your Honor.

The gentleman is Robert Heimann.  He at one point was the president of the American Tobacco Company.  He gave a deposition.  This is a -- the video they would like to show is him being questioned in a deposition.

I believe the case is called Horton.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's right.

MR. GERAGHTY:  From 19 -- I want to say '84 or '85, approximately.  It was an individual smoking and health case, which I believe was pending in the

state of Mississippi.  And he was deposed.

Not... well, let me just say this: Philip Morris, Your Honor, was not a defendant in that case.  We were not a party to that case.

So this is a deposition that he gave on behalf of the American Tobacco Company.  It was after he had retired so he was giving the deposition, as I understand it, in his individual capacity.

But be that as it may, our objection is this was not a public statement that was -- could be construed as being made in furtherance of the conspiracy.  He made it in a deposition, in a legal proceeding.  And Philip Morris was not a party to the -- the case.

So however this document is viewed, the statements made by Mr. Heimann in the deposition are hearsay and there's no exception that would make those statements admissible against Philip Morris.

The last thing I will say is also there's a real big 403 issue here because this is the CEO --or the former CEO of the American Tobacco Company making these statements; and if they tell you, well, this is relevant to reprehensibility, well, we can't be punished, I don't believe, for statements made by the former CEO of the American Tobacco Company.

So for all those reasons we would move to exclude that videotaped deposition and whatever passages plaintiff wants to play from Mr. Heimann.

THE COURT:  Now, if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Carpenter raised these objections before Judge Bell at the pretrial in 2014.

And they discuss explicit passages as well as the deposition as a whole.

Is that your recollection?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, I wasn't there, but that's my understanding, yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Mr. Schultz, response.

MR. SCHULTZ:  It was raised, Your Honor, and then we were told this morning when Mr. Carpenter came in I don't have any issues with any of the videos.  This is one of the videos.

Mr. Heimann was not only the president of American Tobacco -- and he was testifying in his capacity as a corporate --

THE COURT:  Let me -- I've read the whole discussion.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.

THE COURT:  The extensive argument that was made, and the discussion and Judge Bell's ruling and I'm going to -- I'm not going to reconsider Judge

Bell's ruling at this time.  Thank you.

Anything else?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Urn, well, I -- one other -- one other issue, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. GERAGHTY:  There's a slide that was given to me this morning.

This is advertising expenditures on an annual basis.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GERAGHTY:  My objection simply is relevance and 403.  The amount of the expenditures I don't think have any independent relevance, Your Honor.

Mr. Schultz is going to be able to show lots of advertisements.  He's going to show marketing videos.  He's going to show lots of other evidence that shows what was actually presented to the American public, and that could have been seen by Mr. Danielson.

And the amount that is spent on advertising and promotion and things of that nature have no independent relevance.  And I think there's a big 403 issue here, because they just want to show big million-dollar numbers, billion-dollar numbers, if you will, of the amount that's spent from 1974 up

through the 2000s; and that has no independent relevance and it runs the risk of confusing the jury and misleading the jury about what the real issues are in the case.

So we would -- we would ask that that be excluded.

THE COURT:  Mr. Schultz, I frankly don't have a problem with this other than in Phase I, it goes past the time frame of Mr. Danielson's death.

I mean, this takes us all the way up to 2000 --and I understood that he died in the 1990s, 1996; is that right?

MR. SCHULTZ:  1995.

MR. GERAGHTY:  '95.

THE COURT:  1995.  So to the extent this can be modified to reflect only through 1995, I would overrule the defendant's objection; but I would sustain the objection to anything after 1995.

MR. SCHULTZ:  We will do that, Your Honor.

And, for the record, we don't contend that marketing Marlboros is in and of itself --especially after his death, obviously -- tortious. The -- the -- the concealment that goes along with it certainly is during his lifetime.

But I was characterizing it as just wanting to

throw a big number in front of the jury; and I would like for the record to reflect they've been saying since jury selection that advertising doesn't make anybody do anything, it doesn't matter much, and pervasiveness of advertising is something from which the Martin case itself says the inference can be drawn.  And when you spend three billion dollars to market a product, that gets it out there pretty pervasively.  I just want the record to reflect that.

THE COURT:  I understand.  I overruled his objection that it was not relevant or that its relevance was outweighed by its potential for undue prejudice; but I appreciate the fact that you guys need to make a record --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  -- for possible appellate purposes.

But with respect to that document, the -- those figures after 1995 need to be redacted.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I should � I need to tell Dr. Cummings that because I'm sure he has a figure in his head based on these numbers and I don't want him to blurt out the wrong number.

THE COURT:  If his testimony is reliant upon that, you may tell him solely that the Court --

We were talking about Philip Morris studied

back in 1970 on 14- to 17-year-olds.

If we could, Ryan, could we pull up LP 4789. MR. GERAGHTY:  4789. MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, are you familiar with this document entitled, The Study of Smoking Habits Among Young Smokers, prepared by Philip Morris July of 1974?

A.   I am.

Q.   And who prepared this document for Philip Morris?

A.   I believe it was -- well, it was Roper that prepared it, and there's a cover note that goes with it internally at Philip Morris from Al Udell [phonetic], who was in the marketing department.

Q.   Is this a document that would have been a confidential or nondisclosed document at the time it was created?

A.   Yes.  This is an internal company document.

Q.   And is the Roper organization the same organization we just saw in 1970 doing the work and reporting to the president of the company?

A.   Correct.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Ryan, if we could pull up Page 2,

please. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   It says, "The purpose of this 1974 study among smokers age 24 and younger was to gain insights as to what is happening with regard to their brand preferences and images of cigarette brands in that segment of the population."

Let me ask, first of all, is Mr. Danielson 24 years or younger when this research is done?

A.   Yes, he is.

Q. And the question is posed, "What is happening in the young market with regard to Marlboro nonmenthol and menthols?"

Can you just describe briefly, if you would, to the jury what concern or issue prompted this according to the document?

A.   Again, back in 1970 the president of Philip Morris Joe Cullman had noticed that their benchmark study wasn't characterizing the sales of some of their brand, namely, Marlboro.

And so they proposed, went to -- the proposal came back to Philip Morris from the Roper organization to do a supplemental survey of 14- to 17-year-olds, students attending college and military.  And this is

So not only did they talk about it; they executed it.  And this is the results of the -- you know, showing how they went about the survey in the 14-to 17-year-olds, the college students and the military. MR. SCHULTZ:  Can you show us, please, Ryan,

Page 3 of the document? BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   It indicates, Dr. Cummings, "An upper age limit of 24 was assigned but no lower age limit, and instructions to get some college students in each age group was given.  Interviewers were instructed to go to locations where young people, as described in their quota assignments, were likely to be found, near high schools and colleges, around young people's hangouts, such as soda fountains, recreation areas, parks, bowling alleys, beaches, lakes, et cetera."

Is that what you were just describing in terms of how they went about carrying out the study?

A.   Yes.

statement, Dr. Cummings, "Marlboro MN."  Is that nonmenthol?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Is that Lamar Danielson's brand? A.   Yes.

Q.   "Marlboro nonmenthol appears to have become static while Kool is growing."

And if we go down to the -- to the next paragraph.

"It has a much stronger share among young men among -- than among young women."

And they're comparing it to Kool.  Was that part of the purpose to try and figure out who is smoking Marlboro and who is smoking Kool? A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And if we look over, Ryan, at Page 10 of the document. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Do they tell us, Dr. Cummings -- Roper tell Philip Morris, that is, the percentage of young white men who are smoking Marlboro nonmenthol? A.   Correct.  43 percent.

MR. SCHULTZ:  If we look back over, I think, at Page 7, Ryan.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Is this an indication -- first of all, Dr. Cummings, we saw the effort back in 1970 that you've already discussed with the jury.  They've got 43 percent of young white men.

Is that the target demographic for Marlboro according to those documents?

A.   It is.

Q.   And so does it appear, based on this document, that the youth marketing efforts in that demographic were working?

A.   It does.  The -- they have other tables in this document that shows the high penetration among 14- to 17-year-old boys, that Marlboro was their No. 1 brand. So they were winning the -- the brand share among this younger demographic.  Also college students and people in the military, who tended to be young males at the time.

Q.   And it does say at the bottom of the -- this page, Philip --

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm sorry.  Which page are you

on, please?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.  I'm on Page 7.  Thank

you.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   "We're not sure anything can be done to halt a major exodus if one gets going among the young.  This group follows the crowd, and we don't pretend to know what gets them going from one thing or another. Certainly Philip Morris should continue efforts for Marlboro in the youth market, but perhaps as strongly as possible aimed at the white market rather than attempting to encompass blacks as well."

So is this indicating to us, Dr. Cummings, that they're focusing on young white men?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And is Lamar Danielson part of the very demographic that they're talking about in this document?

A.   He is.

Q.   Did Philip Morris continue its efforts at youth marketing as suggested in this document?

A.   They certainly did.  They continued to study the smoking habits of young people and were highly successful in capturing young men and later young women with Marlboro Lights among the younger demographic. They became the top-selling brand among youth.

Q.   And if we go a year ahead, Dr. Cummings, again, we see Dr. Dunn's name up in the corner, but this is a document from Myron Johnston.

A.   He is.

Q.   To Dr. R.B. Seligman.  Can you remind the jury who Dr. Seligman is?

A.   He was vice president in charge of R&D at Philip Morris.

Q.   And Mr. Johnston says, "Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers -- younger smokers."  Is that correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   So does Philip Morris, according to this document, at least, feel that the rise that they've seen that we've just seen reflected in the previous document is due in large part to young smokers like Lamar Danielson?

MR. SCHULTZ:  LP 4378.

Can you pull the live document, Ryan.  We can find the precise page?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you.

THE COURT:  For the benefit of counsel, when you refer to a document, if you could give the document number, it would be helpful.  Thank you.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'd appreciate that, Your Honor. Thank you.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.

We're back in 1975.  And I'm looking, Ryan, for the paragraph that says, "Marlboro has for many years had its highest market penetration among younger smokers."

Maybe on the next -- here we go. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   "The teenage years are also important because those are the years during which most smokers begin to smoke, the years in which initial brand selections are made, and the period in the life cycle in which conformity to peer group norms is the greatest."

Dr. Cummings, is that what you were talking about earlier when you said that brand loyalty and brand choices are made early among smokers?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And was that true for Lamar Danielson?

A.   It was.

Q.   Do you recognize these quotes, Dr. Cummings, the first being, "Realistically, if our company is to survive and prosper, over the long-term we must get our share of the youth market"?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Who is Claude Teague?

A.   Claude Teague was in charge of new product development at R.J. Reynolds.  He was a senior scientist.  He was a chemist, and he wrote a document --actually, I think you had 1974, but that document is actually 1973.

And -- where he talked about capturing a share of the youth market.  And this is one of the statements there where he noted that, you know, "If our company is to survive and prosper, over the long-term we must get our share of the youth market."

Q.   That's LP 0400 for the record.

A.   That's right.

A.   Yes.

Q.   "We will no longer be able to rely on a rapidly increasing pool of teenagers from which to replace smokers lost through normal attrition."

What are the two primary ways to lose smokers through attrition (inaudible)?

A.   Quitting and dying.

Q.   Lorillard Mr. Ted Achey LP0501 says, "The base of our business is the high school student." Who was Mr. Achey at Lorillard?

A.   He was a regional sales manager for Lorillard, and he was describing the growth of Newport cigarettes in his region, actually in New Jersey, northeast region, during this time noting that the base of their business, their sales, in other words, for Newport was in high school students.

Q.   And LP1285 is by Robert Heimann at the American Tobacco Company.  Can you tell the jury -- we'll hear more from him -- who Mr. Heimann was?

A.   Sure.  Early on in his career he was basically in marketing and sales at American.  He rose up the ranks and became the president of American Tobacco, and he's also talking about the relevance or importance of young people.

Q.   And he says, "There follows a listing of

possible ways to counteract the anticigarette propaganda among young people who will shortly enter the important 18 to 25 age group."

Is it fair to say, Dr. Cummings, based on your review of these particular documents and other documents, that youth were important to the industry as a whole, including Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.  I mean, you needed to capture the youth market, because if you didn't capture the youth market, your sales would eventually evaporate, because people would either quit or die.  So you needed to replenish the crops, so to speak, by capturing the share of the youth.  Marketing the companies and the brands that were successful were the companies that captured the youth market to replenish those who quit and died.

Q.   Was Marlboro one of those?

A.   The most successful in history.

Q.   In the summary of your addiction opinions, Dr. Cummings, we mentioned you had talked about addiction and then talked about marketing of Marlboro and then the conspiracy.

Is it your opinion that nicotine in cigarettes is powerfully addictive?

A.   Yes.

someone to smoke enough to get sick?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is it your opinion Lamar Danielson was heavily addicted from a young age to the nicotine in Marlboro cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Mr. Danielson was motivated to quit smoking and quit smoking on many occasions but relapsed even after his lung cancer diagnosis at age 41.  Is that your opinion?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And finally, Lamar Danielson's addiction to nicotine caused his increased exposure to the toxins in cigarettes that caused cancer.  Is that your opinion?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Based on all the evidence we've talked about, both from the record in this case and your understanding of the industry?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   So I'd like to move on, Dr. Cummings, if we might, and you've told the jury already you've published in the area of cigarette marketing?

A.   Quite a bit, yes.

Q.   Have you published in the area of youth marketing, a subject we've already been talking about?

A.   Very specifically I have, yes.

Q.   And have you studied the literature produced by others on the marketing of cigarettes?

A.   I have.

Q.   Let me start by asking you this question: Between 1940 and the mid 2000s, how much money did the cigarette industry spend on marketing in the United States?

A.   Well, paid advertising.  So what they're paying for that gets recorded is about 250 billion during that period of time.  Probably the most heavily advertised consumer product ever.

Q.   And in your opinion, Dr. Cummings, does cigarette advertising encourage young people to take up smoking?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object.

That calls for speculation and --

teenagers yourself?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And based on the work you've done and based on the -- the documents you've reviewed, is it your opinion that advertising has an influence on young smokers?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I object for the same grounds

previously, and also it invades the province of the

jury.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll overrule the objection.

A.   Yes, I have studied that.  And, yes, advertising has a direct relationship to the brands that young people select.  So it relates to not necessarily the first cigarette somebody smokes, which often is done with friends or they might steal it from their parents or whatever, but when you go out and buy your cigarettes, advertising is a direct relationship.

So there are many studies that have demonstrated this, including my own, and also reflected in the business documents of the companies. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And if we go back before Mr. Danielson was born, just briefly, would these be typical or representative of the sorts of advertising through the 1940s into the early 1950s?

A.   Yes.  These are, you know, 1940 vintage and

19- -- really 1950s.  The more doctors smoked Camel, just, you know, normalizing smoking.  It was done by athletes, by actors.  You can see Ronald Reagan, and I think that's Jimmy Stewart, up there, you know, handing out cartons of cigarettes, you know, at holidays, like Santa, you know, Christmastime or, you know, for Mother's or Father's Day.  This was very common to see gift cartons.  Just showing you how normal smoking was at that time.

Q.   I was going to ask you that question.  When you said "normalized," does that what you mean, that it's the normal thing to do?

A.   It was the accepted thing to do.  And for young people growing up in that era, it was a rite of passage to smoke.  In fact, in the early '50s half of -- over half of all American boys were smoking cigarettes.

So it was an accepted, normal thing to do. People were not really focused on, you know, smoking being such a bad thing like we do today.

Q.   Did you bring, Dr. Cummings, an internal marketing video, internal to Philip Morris, I mean, talking about Marlboro, specifically, and the marketing of Marlboro?

A.   Yes.  In my research, I've identified, you know, looking at marketing documents, but they have also

So this is in 1991 talking about the history of Marlboro and the success of the marketing of the Marlboro brand that made Marlboro the No. 1 selling cigarette in the world.

MALE SPEAKER:  Let's go back in time and take a look at how the Marlboro story developed.  Back in the 1950s, Marlboro was advertised to female smokers.

The cigarette itself was white and package was white and feminine and the copy read, "You need never feel over smoked.  That's the miracle of Marlboro."

But in 1954, the Philip Morris company saw an opportunity to make major revisions in Marlboro and its image.

Times were changing and the filter cigarettes were becoming popular.  Marlboro was reformulated to make it stronger, more flavorful, and more appealing to male smokers.

To launch the new Marlboro, a revolutionary new package was designed.  The now-famous flip-top box. The flip-top box was bold, eye-catching, masculine. It carried a distinctive design in red and white which has come to be known as the Marlboro Red roof. Over the years the red roof has proved to be an outstanding logo, and it is now the most famous symbol in the history of advertising.

The move in 1954 by Philip Morris to reposition Marlboro was bold and innovative.  This decision combined with many others along the way, has made Marlboro the greatest success in tobacco history.

The cowboy was an instantly recognizable symbol of masculinity, and he was used in Marlboro advertising along with other rugged men, who were strong and masculine, wearing tattoos that hinted at romantic pasts.

But in 1962, the Marlboro man had become strictly a cowboy.

He now had a clear-cut, unmistakable identity.

And he had a home.  Marlboro Country.

He was his own man, in a world he owned.

And television and print combined to romance his rugged masculinity and the beauty of Marlboro Country.

[MUSIC]

MALE SPEAKER:  Television advertising of cigarettes ended in the U.S. in 1911,   but Marlboro made a smooth transition to printed outdoor advertising.  This successful transition was largely due to the depth of the Marlboro Country idea.

In 1955, Marlboro sales in the United States were a modest 6 billion; however, within only one year, volume nearly tripled and Marlboro sales to smokers took off domestically.

Throughout the 1960s, Marlboro sales to smokers gained even more momentum, both domestically and around the world.  In fact, total volume for Marlboro sales to smokers more than doubled during this decade.  As a result, combined sales reached 105 billion in 1972, making Marlboro the best-selling cigarette in the world, and it has remained the leader ever since.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, I heard in there "the most famous symbol in the history of advertising, the greatest success in tobacco history and one of the most successful marketing concepts in the world."

Would that be just self-hype, or would that be accurate based on your review of the sales data and the

market?

A.   That's accurate.

Q.   And do you have a figure of how much money was spent on Marlboro marketing during Lamar Danielson's lifetime?

A.   Well, the estimate based on spending about $130 million a year, you know, he smoked for roughly 2 6 years, so over 3 billion just for Marlboro cigarette advertising.

Q.   And the video mentioned that sales doubled in the 1960s.

Would that have been when Lamar Danielson was coming of age?

A.   Yes.  Marlboro really grew up.  He was -- as I said earlier on, he was part of the Marlboro generation. It was that baby boom generation that grew up with Marlboro and really propped up their sales.  And there was some unique aspects of the engineering of Marlboro that made them successful.

Q. And I know you brought LP5770-A, is the number, a video that is much shorter, also describing the growth of Marlboro; is that right?

A.   Yes.  There are a number of these videos internal to the company where they, you know, talk about their success, and this one was in 1972 talking about

their ad spending and how that directly related to their

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we see that, please, Ryan?

MALE SPEAKER:  (Inaudible) and by 1957, we sold close to 28 billion Marlboros.  That means each and every day of 1957 we sold three times as many cigarettes as we did in the whole year of '53. Three times as many every day.

Marlboro.

Few campaigns have been as single-minded in purpose and as unique and fresh in execution.  In a world that was becoming increasingly complex and frustrating for ordinary man, the cowboy represented a man whose environment was simplistic and relatively pressure-free.  He was his own man in a world he owned, and he seemed to be an ideal symbol for our cigarette, the crystallization of seven years of theme development.  And we showed him standing in dramatic low-angle photos against cityscapes inviting smokers to join him in Marlboro Country.  Marlboro Country, that was the label.  The headline idea that seemed to hold it all together, masculine cowboy smoking his cigarette in his private world, Marlboro Country.  And the Marlboro coat, or Marly coat as it's called, has become standard apparel.  In fact, a whole new trend of western menswear has been attributed to the impact of Marlboro advertising.  But, of course, imitation is just one indicator of a successful advertising campaign.  The important one is sales.  The changes of the late '50s flattened our growth.  Then, as the effect of the (inaudible) as our advertising became more dramatically focused our image more powerful,

Q.   Dr. Cummings, I wanted to ask you first, the ads that we saw in there with Paul Hornung, for example, the football players, would those be the sorts of ads that Lamar Danielson would have been surrounded by growing up, Marlboro ads in particular?

A.   Sure.  Marlboro used athletes.  The -- they were involved in -- actually I think the most valuable player award for the NFL was the Marlboro award.

So just to show you how common, and there were many athletes there, all represented in different aspects of, you know, Marlboro promotions that were done, and very common.  Of course, this is during the time when cigarette advertising would appear on television.

It was also -- you know, they were involved in advertising and sporting arenas.  So you'd see the billboards, the scoreboards would be the Marlboro score board and so on.  So, you know, growing up in this time

period that was it.  You wanted to be a star, independent and strong, you would select Marlboro as your brand.

Q.   And based on your review of the depositions in this case, would the -- Lamar Danielson's household growing up have had a television during the 1950s?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, Philip Morris attributed in the video, Dr. Cummings, the success of Marlboro to advertising --was advertising and the amount of money you've already described being spent on advertising for Marlboro during that time, the only thing that changed at Marlboro during the 1960s?

A.   No.  They reformulated their product, as they talked about.  I mean, in the -- in the '50s it went to a stronger blend.  They used more burley tobacco in the blend.  And then began to use the manmade tobacco, reconstituted tobacco, where they would add various pH modifiers to the product.  And in particular, in the mid-'60s they began to use various pH modifiers that gave more impact to the nicotine.  And, you know, things like various ammonia compounds and so on were added to the recon tobacco that was used, and that really was one of the reasons that Marlboro sales took off.

combination of those things, the advertising and the --the design of the product itself?

A.   Sure.  You've got to get a product that is going to deliver the impact that people are looking for, and then you put your -- you know, your marketing dollars.  And Philip Morris, nothing happened by accident.  It was carefully researched and orchestrated, and the results, as they say themselves, were the result of the most successful product marketing campaign.  And marketing is, you know, product, price, promotion and placement.  All of those things together.  That's what the marketing mix is.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, I want to go back to 1953 and talk about another Roper poll that was done.  Is this the same Roper organization that we saw in 1970 and 1974 working for Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it's entitled -- and this is LP1452, these are excerpts from pages 1 and 7 -- titled Studies of People's Cigarette Smoking Habits, Prepared for Philip Morris and Company Limited, Inc., August of 1953.

What work is Elmo Roper, the organization, doing for Philip Morris back in 1953 at this time?

And this study included over 10,000 households where they interviewed 15-year-olds and older as part of it, and whole range of topics to see if that concept that they were -- that they later introduced was going to be successful, and it proved to be.

questions about filter-tipped cigarettes, which at the time in the early '50s only really amounted to about 2 percent or less in the market. A couple of filtered brands had been introduced in 1952 and they were about ready to introduce Philip Morris, their first filtered brand, which was Marlboro.

Q.   And it indicates in -- I believe this would be on Page 21 we have on the slide, "It would seem increasingly important from the point of view of Philip Morris regular-sized cigarettes to do everything possible to increase the trend among young people toward Philip Morris."

And is that what the evidence will show, Dr. Cummings, that Philip Morris eventually did?

A.   Yes.

Q.   With this information?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it indicates that they believe that to increase that trend it's competing in a market that's becoming more and more what might be called a man's market and a flavor market.

Is that, based on the video that we just saw and your research, exactly the focus that was put on Marlboro cigarettes?

A.   Right.  Marlboro was aimed at -- at males, and

they emphasized their strong flavor in a filtered cigarette, because the early entries in the filter market had emphasized less tar, which was a turnoff to young people.  Young people wanted, you know, a flavorful cigarette.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is, again,

calling for speculation and hearsay about what --

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll overrule the objection. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   You can continue.

A.   So young people were looking for -- they were interested in new technology, filter was new because very few cigarettes had filters, and they were interested in one to distinguish it from the early filtered brands that had been introduced, one that would emphasize strong flavor, which is what, you know, Marlboro did.  That's exactly what they did.

Q.   You mentioned George Weissman had commissioned the study.  Is that the same George Weissman we see in this document here (indicating)?

A.   Right.  He was vice president at Philip Morris and actually rose up to ranks, eventually served on their board of directors.  And this is a memo that he wrote regarding the survey to Robert Dupuis, who was head of research and development at Philip Morris at the

Q.   And this, for the record, is LP0275.  It all comes from the first page of the document, dated October 7th, 1953.  So would this be a couple of months after what we just saw a moment ago?

A.   Correct.

Q.   He says, "Attached is a copy of the preliminary report from the Elmo Roper Organization on the first study for Philip Morris."  He mentions that 10,000 people were interviewed.  Is he referring here to the document we looked at in the previous slide?

A.   Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm sorry, can we approach

briefly?

THE COURT:  You may.

(The following proceedings were held outside of

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, my problem is a

logistical one, and that is that that last document,

for example, is like 300 pages long.

And I'm not faulting Mr. Schultz for this, but

I just have logistical issues here.  Documents are being flashed on the screen and very small excerpts are being pulled from these very large documents and they're embedded in the PowerPoint.

I don't know where in the document those excerpts are coming from.  I know that Mr. Schultz wants to move things along and I'm obviously not --I'm only objecting when I feel I have to, but I can't follow along -- I can't locate where in the document these excerpts are if I'm not getting the document identified first, the page we're going to read from, and at least a few moments to try to locate that.

As Your Honor may be able to tell, I have two very large banker's boxes of documents behind my chair over my right shoulder there, and there is about 180 documents and several thousands of pages of stuff.  And I can't raise objections or ask for rule of completeness designations if I can't locate the information quickly enough.

All I'm saying is, I'm asking that there be a requirement that that be done and that we just give me a moment or two to locate that before passages get read on the screen.

that, Judge.  I gave the document page number on this one and if he needs more time he deserves more time.

MR. GERAGHTY:  But on the one PowerPoint there are three separate excerpts.  I believe they're from three separate pages, so I can't -- I can only read one excerpt at a time.

MR. SCHULTZ:  As I indicated, they're all three from the first page.  That's at least the way we have it marked as.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't see the second one on here.

THE COURT:  Again, his request is not unreasonable.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Sure.

THE COURT:  It's -- it's appropriate for quid pro quo.  He will do the same for you when he's presenting his.  Just as I have asked you to do, make sure you give him a document number to begin with, and then if it's a document that's more than a page or two, then give him the page number from which you're doing that.

And certainly, an excerpt from page 1 and an excerpt from page 371 wouldn't be appropriate, but you're telling me that's not what you're doing here.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's what's on our slide.  But it should be (inaudible), Judge.  If it's not, he deserves the time he needs.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't see (inaudible) encouragingly enough on this page here, that's page 1.  I mean, if you call out the page number I know you guys got your own -- your own page numbers I can follow that, but I don't think they all come from page 1 is what I'm saying.

I don't want to delay things.  I'd rather we move through this quickly.

MR. SCHULTZ:  (Inaudible) issue if we at least start with full pages.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I understand that, I mean... I don't know what to say about that.  I shouldn't have to make a choice between the one or the other.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I would say let's take it slow, make sure Mr. Geraghty is with us as he deserves to be, and if there's an issue and it's a consistent problem then we need to stop and see if there's a way to address it ahead of time.

THE COURT:  When we are conducting our sidebars, I need to know, are you able to hear what we're saying?  Okay.  You're all shaking your heads, and that's the universal sign for no so... (Laughter.) Okay.  Thank you. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, we were looking at the second paragraph, encouragingly enough, we have our greatest strength in the 15 to 24 age group as against Camel and Chesterfield.  And eventually Mr. Weissman says to the head of research, the Roper results come close enough, I believe, to enable us to proceed on the assumption that the qualitative aspects of the survey are valid.

And my question to you is, is that -- this is an October of 1953, what did we see following on the heels of this in terms of the Marlboro cigarette?

A. Well, it's when they redesigned Marlboro to be a man's cigarette, filtered cigarette with a new filter blend. So aimed at men. Strong flavor, just like they talked about in their history.

Q.   And if we go ahead to the next slide and, Mr. Geraghty, I'll give you the number.  It's LP1848. And I have the page.  It's 14 and 15. While Mr. Geraghty is pulling the document,

Dr. Cummings, can you tell the jury what is a -- an annual report for a company like Philip Morris?

A.   Sure.  Philip Morris puts out annual reports to its stockholders, so if you own stock for Philip Morris they would send you a copy of their annual report.

It would talk about what was, you know, relevant in that particular year about their sales, about their marketing and so on for products that they had.  And here, they're talking about Marlboro marketing in the 1960s related to, you know, where -- what television shows that they sponsored, where they had their advertising and sponsorship, which was very common back in this time period when cigarette advertising was permitted on television, only three channels at that time.

And the cigarette companies dominated and Philip Morris certainly was a -- one of the companies --it devoted a lot of its advertising to sponsorship on shows like Red Skelton, Jackie Gleason, Hazel, Candid Camera, Hogan's Heroes, westerns, the National Football League games and so on.

And they also talk about print advertising, which was very common as well.  TV Guide, probably one of the most purchased magazines at that time.  Lifetime, Sports Illustrated, Look, Newsweek and so on that

Q.   And do we also have an annual report from 1962? MR. SCHULTZ:  And if I can address Mr. Geraghty briefly, I think I can help him, Your Honor, locate it.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I found it.  I've got it. MR. SCHULTZ:  LP1845 and pages 10 to 12.  And I'll give Mr. Geraghty a moment to pull that up, Your Honor.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Is this another annual report similar to the one we just looked at? A.   It is.

Q.   It says, "Marketing efforts in 1962 utilized virtually all media available to tell our product story. Continued increases in sales are most gratifying indications of an effective effort.  Network television is our major medium."

And then it lists some shows again like the other slide.

Was the advertising environment -- first of all, would Mr. Danielson have been nine turning -- eight turning nine years old in 1962?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And was the advertising environment very different for a child back in the '60s like Mr. Danielson when it comes to cigarettes, including Marlboro cigarettes?

A.   Yes.  I mean, if -- I know from personal experience.  I'm the same age.  I grew up in that environment and you were exposed to cigarette advertising on a daily basis.  If you were watching, you know, popular shows of the day you were getting exposed to cigarette advertising and promoting different brands using athletes and others to do so.

So this is just Philip Morris talking about it in their annual report for their stockholders.

Q.   And the Marlboro man image, would it have appeared on billboards?

A.   Billboards, point of sale, you know, back --back covers of magazines or the centerfold of a magazine.  They bought the best and prime locations in print ads.  These are examples of print ads you would see primarily in magazines, newspapers.  Typically in color.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, did they consistently project an image of a man's or macho cigarette with an emphasis on flavor?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I'd like to pull up -- and we can pull this up live.  It's a lengthy document.  LP4999. MR. GERAGHTY:  4999? MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   While Mr. Geraghty is pulling up his copy, Dr. Cummings, can you tell the jury what a Federal --who the Federal Trade Commission is when it comes to cigarettes, what their role is and what a Federal Trade Commission Report is?

A.   Sure.  Federal Trade Commission regulates trade.  So from -- you know, in the United States, including they were mandated by Congress, actually, in the mid-1960s to put out an annual report on cigarette marketing.  And this is their first report that they put out.  It came out in 1967.

And it's looking at the effects of a variety of things around consumer response to the advertising, how much exposure they're getting.  The effects of health warnings or caution warnings that came out in 1966 are

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'll be brief, Your Honor.  And I'11 acknowledge that there were motions in limine that were filed in front of Judge Bell.  One was to exclude the Surgeon General's Report as hearsay and also to exclude these FTC Reports as hearsay.

Judge Bell granted that motion in limine with respect to the Surgeon General's Reports.  He denied the motion in limine with respect to these FTC Reports having said that, I just -- I -- I need to

make sure I preserve my position.

These FTC Reports are government reports, not subject to any recognized exception under the Florida Rules of Evidence.  They are the opinions and the statements of many, many different people synthesized in this document.  There are surveys of people not associated with the government that are, then, analyzed in this document.

I would move to exclude the document on that ground that it is hearsay, not subject to exception under the Florida rules.  But I did want to let Your Honor know that Judge Bell had heard that argument and overruled that objection.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Judge, we had this argument 13 months ago and now we're in the middle of the examination.  FTC Reports and Surgeon General Reports are different.

Surgeon General Reports come -- report everything there is out there to be reported.  FTC Reports -- the page I was just about to show the jury -- are mandated by Congress.  They are the findings of the FTC.  That's what makes them different.  That's what brings them within the hearsay exception.  Just as Judge Bell has rules, just as Judge Truvel [phonetic] ruled in every

THE COURT:  These documents were used in the Engle trial?

MR. SCHULTZ:  That, I don't know.  I can find out because we have a list of which documents are in or out in Engle.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't know the answer. MR. SCHULTZ:  But they were used in Martin and Gray and Seltzer and Brown, and they were ruled on here.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  I didn't hear all of the argument before Judge Bell and I'm going to decline to reconsider his ruling.  Thank you.

(The following proceedings were held within the hearing of the jury.) BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   I was asking you, Dr. Cummings -- I think you may have mentioned, in fact -- these Federal Trade Commission Reports, are they reports that Congress required that the Federal Trade Commission go out and investigate and make? A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And if we look over, please, Ryan, at Page 15. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   By the way, 1967, that's the date of this report?

A.   Yes, it is.

Q.   And based on your review of the evidence in this case, where would Lamar Danielson be in his smoking career, if you will, around 1967?

A.   Just starting to smoke.

Q.   The Federal Trade Commission reported to Congress that during the single month of January 1967, 87 network television programs were sponsored in whole or in part by cigarette products.

Of the six major cigarette manufacturers, would Philip Morris be one of those?

A.   Yes.

Q.   An estimated 1.685 billion viewers watched 60 programs during the week commencing January 11th, 1967. In this context, a person who watched ten of the 60 programs counts as ten viewers.  And among the estimated total number of viewers were 125 million tuned into sporting event programs.

I think you've already told the jury, Dr. Cummings, it was common to see cigarette advertising in sporting events during this time period?

A.   Yes, it was.

Q.   Is it fair to say --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, let's take a look at Page 16, Ryan.  It's a rather lengthy quote. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q. Is this another description based on the FTC's investigation of the marketing environment in the 1960s that it included in its report to Congress?

A.   Yes.  It's their description of the extent to which the population was exposed to cigarette advertising, which they said, "Cigarette advertising reaches virtually all Americans who can either read or understand the spoken word.  Cigarettes are advertised in both network and spot television, on radio, in magazines, and in newspapers, in outdoor media, and by means of many types of point-of-sale advertising aids. So pervasive is cigarette advertising that it is virtually impossible for Americans of almost any age to avoid cigarette advertising."

And they go on to explain, for example, "The morning radio news broadcasts were often preceded or followed by spot advertisements for a cigarette brand. Outdoor billboards, trains, buses carry advertising visible to both children and adults on their way to work or school.  Restaurants and drug stores often have advertising decals for cigarettes on the entrance doors and a variety of other display materials, such as wall

clocks, change counter mats.  Many of the daytime and evening television programs are sponsored by cigarette manufacturers; and numerous magazines and newspapers read by the whole family contain cigarette advertising."

Q.   Thanks for that, Dr. Cummings.

As you've read all the depositions in this case, is there anything in this case to suggest that Lamar Danielson was somehow immune to this pervasive advertising that we see reported by the FTC?

A.   No.  Just the opposite.  The fact that he smoked the most popular and heavily-marketed brand, Marlboro, is an indication that he was affected by the advertising.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object and

move to strike as lacking foundation.

THE COURT:  I see that as speculation.  I would

sustain the objection.

The last comment of the witness will be

stricken and not considered by you in your

deliberations. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Did Lamar Danielson, based on your review of the evidence, Doctor, watch television, read newspapers, generally participate as -- as a consumer in American culture?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Including a smoking consumer?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And did he, as a teen, smoke the most popular brand among teens at the time that he began smoking?

A.   Yes, he did.

Q.   A brand that Philip Morris's own documents suggest or tell us were directed at teen smokers?

A.   Yes.

Q.   If we look over at Page 61, does this give us examples, Dr. Cummings, of the television shows that would be advertised on in this time period back in the mid-1960s?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And advertised in specifically by cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Cigarette companies?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Including Super Bowl, Beverly Hillbillies, NBA pro basketball, Rat Patrol.

Is it fair to say, Dr. Cummings, I've asked you before, very different from the environment today in terms of advertising, particularly in terms of what teenagers might be exposed to in cigarette advertisement?

A.   Yes.  Very different today.

Q.   And does this graph or table by the FTC tell us, in fact, some of the numbers of viewers that we have in Mr. Danielson's age group in the 19- -- mid-1960s?

A.   Yes.  This is looking at total audience in millions, and then under 21, they break it down for teens, and then children two to 12 that might be watching a particular show.

These were all shows that were sponsored by cigarette advertising.  And this is their analysis that was done to get their estimate during that week of July 11th [sic], 1967.

Q.   And which group would Mr. Danielson fall into?

A.   He would have been in the -- right at this point the 13 to 17 teen group.

Q.   If we can go back to the PowerPoint, please. What year, Dr. Cummings, did the first cautionary statement go onto cigarette packs?

A.   1966.

Q.   I think you've told the jury, Mr. Danielson probably started smoking somewhere in this time period, maybe 1967?

A.   Correct.

the packs of cigarettes by the time Mr. Danielson started smoking?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did the Federal Trade Commission, in reporting in 1961,   the same report that we just saw, also comment on the efficacy or how well the warnings on the packs worked at that time?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And is this that report?

A.   Yes.

Q. And the FTC says, "There is virtually no evidence that the warning statements on cigarette packages has had any significant effect."

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm sorry.  This is still LP4999,

Mr. Geraghty. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   "The commission believes the warning label on cigarette packages has not succeeded in overcoming the prevalent attitude toward cigarette smoking created and maintained by the cigarette companies through their advertisements, particularly the barrage of commercials on television which portray smoking as a harmless and enjoyable social activity that is not habit-forming and involves no hazards to health."

Is that the Federal Trade Commission's

assessment of the first warning back at the time Mr. Danielson was beginning to smoke?

A. Yes. That conclusion is largely based on their analysis of cigarette sales which actually went up after the warnings went on. So they weren't really having any effect.

Q.   Have you seen evidence in your review of all the industry documents that they followed Federal Trade Commission Reports?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did the industry ask for a stronger warning on packs in 1967 when this came out?

A.   No.

Q.   Had Philip Morris or any other cigarette company voluntarily put a warning on any pack of cigarettes before the warning that went on or cautionary statement that went on in 1966?

A.   No.

Q.   If we go forward, is this still from the same Federal Trade Commission Report we were looking at a moment ago?

A.   Yes.

Q. Indicating that the "failure of the warning statement on packages have any discernible effect on cigarette consumption is easily explainable.  The

warning statement on the package alone has proved to be ineffective, mainly because few people seem to pay attention to it."

Have you seen other -- let me ask you this: You've already told the jury at the beginning of your testimony today that you've published in the area of cigarette warnings; is that right?

A.   Yeah, many studies.

Q.   And is there evidence, based on your work that you've done personally in this area, that people don't seem to pay attention to cigarette warnings?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, again, I would

object.  It's calling for speculation and invading

the province of the jury.

THE COURT:  Overrule the objection.

A.   Yes.  My research shows that people in the United States don't pay attention to their warnings because they're hidden on the sides of the pack.  So they rarely notice or read them. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And is that the Federal Trade Commission's conclusion back in 1967 as well?

A.   Yes.

smoking, the Commission is convinced the present cautionary statement on the cigarette packages is not sufficient to accomplish that result.

"The motivations for smoking physiologically, psychologically, and sociologically are complex and a mere reminder of the hazards of the methodic cigarette package cannot compete with the forces that promote cigarette smoking."

And what was the primary force, of course, promoting cigarette smoking at this time?

A.   Massive amounts of advertising that people were exposed to day in and day out was what was driving smoking.  And then they would, you know -- they had a very weak cautionary warning, "Caution:  Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health."  That was the first caution warning that went on.

Q.   Did that, in fact, change in time, Dr. Cummings?

A.   It did.  In 1970, a stronger warning went on and said, "Surgeon General," it said, "cigarette smoking can be dangerous to your health."  And that went on in 1970, you know, on cigarette packs, and then later on cigarette advertising, print and billboard advertising in 1972.

Q.   And how long did the warning that we see above,

the 1970 warning, remain the warning for all packs of cigarettes?

A.   That warning stayed on the cigarette packs until 1984 and then was replaced by the rotating -- four rotating warnings that we still have today.  Those went on packs in 1985.

Q.   And we have LP6935 from Page 10 of that document.  Is this a Philip Morris internal document --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- concerning the change in the warnings?

A.   Yes, it is.

Q.   And indicates "a harsher warning will be required on all cigarette packages after November 1st, 1970.  It remains to be seen whether this stiffer caution notice will affect sales.  No change was evident when the present notice was added to the package in 1965, and we doubt this new notice will have an adverse effect."

Was there, in fact, Dr. Cummings, a steep decline in the sales of cigarettes after this new warning went on?

A.   No.

Q.   And Mr. Danielson in August of 1970, would he have been 16 years old?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I think you've already told the jury who Claude Teague is and maybe even referenced -- was it this document that you referenced earlier?

A.   This is the 19- -- I think you had listed it at 1974, and I corrected you because it is 1973, and this is the document, yes.

Q.   And is Mr. Teague, then, writing for R.J. Reynolds?

A.   It's Dr. Teague.  Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I apologize. MR. SCHULTZ:  LP0400. MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Teague, or Mr. Teague, says, "The young want to be defiant and smoke."

Let me ask you, is that consistent with what you were talking to the jury about earlier in terms of teen rebellion?

A.   Yes.  You know, teens smoke for psychosocial reasons.

Q.   "And a new brand aimed at the young group should not in any way be promoted as a health brand and perhaps should carry some implied risk.  In this sense, the warning label on the package may be a plus."

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was he a higher-up in R.J. Reynolds?

A.   Yes, he was.

Q.   Was he somebody who dealt with these issues on a -- on a normal basis within his responsibilities within the company?

A.   Yes.  This time when he was writing this document, he was in charge of new product development for R.J. Reynolds.

Q.   And did, Dr. Cummings, the Tobacco Institute, who the jury has not heard about but will when we talk about the conspiracy soon, did the Tobacco Institute --let me ask you, first of all, just as by way of preview, give a very brief description, if you would, to the jury who they were; what it was.

A.   Well, it was basically an organization funded by the major cigarette companies, including Philip Morris.  It was created in 1958, and they were created really to speak on issues related to smoking and health on behalf of their members.

So when you heard a Tobacco Institute statement, you know, they were speaking on behalf of Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson,

Lorillard Tobacco, American Tobacco during that era.

And they existed from 1958 to -- they went out of business in 1998.

Q.   And was the Tobacco Institute authorized by Philip Morris to speak on its behalf?

A.   Yes, it was.

Q.   In fact, did Philip Morris pay a lot of money to have the Tobacco Institute speak on its behalf?

A.   Yes.  Millions and millions, hundreds of millions of dollars, actually, from Philip Morris to support the Tobacco Institute over its history.

Q.   And did R.J. Reynolds contribute as well to the Tobacco Institute?

A.   They did.

Q.   And did the Tobacco Institute fight stronger warnings on cigarettes?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object and

move to approach on this. THE COURT: You may. (The following proceedings were held outside of

the hearing of the jury.)

MR. GERAGHTY:  Urn, my objection, Your Honor, is

this is irrelevant and 403.  The warnings are what

the warnings are.  The fact that Philip Morris or

some other member of the tobacco industry may have

lobbied Congress and spoke to the government about what they thought the warnings ought to say, that is not a basis for liability on the part of Philip Morris.  We can't be punished for engaging their First Amendment right to lobby their government on these issues.

He's already said the warnings were weak.  He said lots of things about the warnings.  But for them to now get into the issue of whether we opposed stronger warnings, that's completely improper.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

Let me hear your response to that.

MR. SCHULTZ:  So the record is clear, when I talked about weak warnings, first of all, that was the first warning which doesn't have any preadmit concerns.  It's is relevant, Your Honor.  It's part of a conspiracy.  This is part of the normalization of smoking.  And the specific reason I brought it up next to the RJR document is because I didn't want the jury to feel like I was just throwing out some RJR document.  They need to understand these companies.  That's why I did a little preview outline to let them understand these companies are working for the same (inaudible), and that's what this is about.

THE COURT:  Okay.  The -- but the issue of any activities that they engaged in and lobbying Congress for either weaker or stronger or no change to the warnings is not, not protected activity.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, first of all, context is not limited to what Mr. Geraghty described.  We will see evidence of that, in fact, and we'll see evidence they came in under Sheldon Schlesinger, Sheldon Sommers [phonetic], for example, from CTR coming into Congress and telling them that there's no proof that smoking causes lung cancer in 1985. That's a lie.  It's part of the conspiracy, and I don't know if it's in this case, it's been in every other, lies to Congress are not protected.  That was in a hearing fighting the 1985 warnings.

So to the extent they make misrepresentations to Congress, that is not protected by the First Amendment.  That is in the Engle instructions, because that's where we got the first instruction in the Martin case on that issue.

THE COURT:  So, again, not a misrepresentation, but a -- a -- simply going to Congress and saying that "we oppose any additional warnings," you know, can they not do that and within the context of their right to petition Congress?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I agree they have a First Amendment right to go to Congress, Judge.  I agree that --

THE COURT:  If you have issues on which they're misrepresenting things to Congress, in lobbying efforts, even, that they're misrepresenting things to Congress, I think the misrepresentation exception certainly is appropriate.  But to simply take the position that they opposed congressional efforts to make the warnings stricter, isn't that impinging upon the First Amendment rights to --

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'll be happy to follow up and ask him did they make misrepresentations to Congress in doing so.  And we're going to talk about it later, Judge.  I've got a document I'm going to show the jury on the conspiracy.  I was only trying to link it up to RJR now so the jury can put some context to an RJR document popping up about the warnings.

THE COURT:  Going back to the essence of what we're talking about, what the objection is, is the mere lobbying Congress for taking explicit positions that would favor their industry is an activity which they cannot be held punishable for.  They cannot be held liable for that.  They cannot even be broached

as a reason for holding them liable; but if they misrepresent something, in the context of that, then that's fair game, and you can do that.  I think that's where we are.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And I'll ask that question now.

THE COURT:  Well, again, I think it's � if you know what it is, you can go to the documents and you can say, "In the context of that, you know, what --was there misrepresentation?  Is this what that was?"  You can do that.

But, again, you -- what you pose to the jury right now is that it somehow is bad conduct to -- to simply seek to petition Congress for, you know -- to protect your industry. And that's -- and that's the thing he's objecting to. And I think we're in agreement that that's something that is protected by the First Amendment right.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I agree it's protected by the First Amendment.  I don't necessarily agree it falls under the doctrine they say that the liability can't be had, but I will certainly agree to it for preserving purposes, because we're not doing that, Judge.

And I understand I didn't ask for this misrepresentation question.  I may be two or three

slides away from it.  I'll ask him now to make it clear that we're not trying to hold them liable just for opposing the warnings, but I'm going to get there very quickly.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I appreciate Your Honor's ruling on the initial issue that brought me to the sidebar. But now on the sidebar here, he wants to just say, "Did they make misrepresentations to Congress?"  And I think Your Honor has said, "You can't just ask that kind of question in a vacuum to this witness," unless there's a document that he wants to show him and have him focus on that particular document, because then that's even more problematic than --than the issue that brought me to the sidebar in the first instance.

So I would object to just some, you know, did they make misrepresentations to Congress kind of a statement.

THE COURT:  Right.  Again, that was -- that was a shorthand way.  I'm going to ask him -- and I know you're moving things along, and I appreciate that. But as I mentioned before, let's let the testimony come from the witness.

I understand two things there, that you're

trying to find that balance of a control of the witness which they keep complaining he's out of control, and I haven't really seen it with this witness in any of the trials I've had with him.  But notwithstanding still, there is a point to which basically you're just testifying and he's saying, "Yeah, yeah, yeah."

So I think the -- you know, you can get to it -- it is not objectionable to present evidence that they made misrepresentation to Congress if you have such evidence and to do it through this witness, if he has -- if it's within an area of which he has expertise covers.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.  And to the point that, Judge, you mentioned yesterday for whatever it's worth, we agree, he doesn't have to have a document for everything he says.  I do have a document for what I just described.

THE COURT:  Right.  And I overruled the objection a while ago.  Testifying as to an opinion, which I thought he could have, given his expertise.

So, yes, I understand that.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, we were talking about the warnings.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And if we can pull the PowerPoint

back up, please, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   We saw a Philip Morris document, we saw an R.J. Reynolds document, and we saw the FTC Report.

What I'd like to show you now is LP4193.  It's pages 13 and 14.  Is this from another FTC Report in the mid-1970s?

A.   Yes.  This is a report commissioned by the FTC to look at, again, public knowledge about the health risks of smoking.  And this was the -- you know, introduction of how they -- to that particular report that was submitted to the FTC by Dr. Fishbein, actually, who was a psychologist at the University of Illinois.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, you've told the jury you've published in the area, have you not, of perceptions of risk, awareness of risk, particularly among smokers?

A.   Yeah, health perceptions is part of the work, it's part of the training I had in health behavior and health education, wanting to understand what people know and believe and how those beliefs impact their behavior.

So it's part of the research that I do.  It's part of the teaching that I have done to graduate students to try to, you know, help them understand how to design, you know, communications campaigns to promote, you know, public health efforts.

Q.   And does this document, and as you've just described, the -- the text that's up here on the screen, relate to these health perceptions of -- or individuals' perception of health messaging?

A.   Yes.  Dr. Fishbein basically said you need to give the people different kinds of information.  You really have to understand when you assess what people know and believe and how those beliefs likely relate to behavior, three levels or three categories of -- of belief.  And the first level is awareness.

So people might be exposed, be aware that there's an issue that's being discussed in the media and so on, and such as, you know, the Surgeon General's talking about smoking being bad.  You know, you might have heard something about that.  That doesn't mean that you believe it.

The next level is general acceptance.  These are questions that you might see in polls that are done. A person, you know, may believe that cigarette smoking is dangerous to their health.  Okay?  Or maybe they

don't hold that belief.  But you would want to assess that belief.

It's a general acceptance, because it doesn't say that your smoking will affect your health.  And that's the third level, which is a personalized acceptance.  A person may believe that my cigarette smoking is dangerous to my health.  And, you know, what Dr. Fishbein and what the science in this area shows, which is pretty common sense, is the closer you get to personalized belief, the more effect that it has on behavior.  General awareness, hearing about something, really is meaningless.  But it's the first level of communication.  You've got to get somebody to at least hear about the topic.

You -- then you've got to persuade them to come to certain beliefs and then you have to have those beliefs accepted.  And it's really when people begin to accept the -- the belief that smoking is hazardous to their health that you're going to see more change.

And he was doing this in the context of trying to -- he had been commissioned to try to look what the public knows and believes about the effects of cigarette smoking.  And they subsequently did a more detailed analysis that came out a few years later. Q.   Is that the 1981 FTC Report?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Which is -- Ryan, if we can pull

up LP07777, the full document. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Is this the report you were just referring to, Dr. Cummings?

A.   It is.

Q.   Did this report also talk about advertising, talk about consumer awareness on issues of smoking and health around the turn of the 1970s, 1980s?

A.   Right.  It's basically looking as, you know, a summary of what people know and believe about the health risks of smoking.  It talks about cigarette advertising in this report as well, and the effect of advertising and how it might be shaping those beliefs.

It talks about product health warnings and what people knew and what they were actually internalizing in terms of those beliefs.

So it's a very detailed report.  They talk about those three levels of beliefs.  They use a lot of data. They've got actually copies of Elmo Roper polls from --from Philip Morris and the Tobacco Institute. Yankelovich polls, Gallup poles, and there were some government studies that had been done as well.

They looked at really a massive amount of data, and

they summarized it in this report and they draw some conclusions about what people sort of knew and believed about the health risks of smoking in the 1980s.  1981.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we look at, Ryan, Page 12. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   I think this slide, Dr. Cummings, talks about the focus of the investigation.  They say there's been a substantial growth of medical information in recent years.  What are the known health consequences of smoking.  What health information does cigarette advertising contain about the nature, probability and severity of the dangers of smoking.  Does the public already know these facts, or does a substantial portion of the population lack knowledge or -- lack knowledge of or hold false beliefs about the dangers of smoking.  Is the current warning effective in alerting public about the hazards of smoking, and is remedial action necessary.

I think you use different words, but is this describing basically the task that the FTC had when they put together this report?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is the report over 300 pages long?

next, Ryan, would be Page 14. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Although most Americans are generally aware that smoking is hazardous, some consumers, especially smokers, do not know this basic fact.  However, even if it is assumed that every consumer is aware that smoking is hazardous, the evidence indicates that many consumers do not have enough information about the health risks of smoking in order to know how dangerous smoking is, i.e., what is the nature and extent of the health risks of smoking.  Many consumers also do not know whether the general health risks of smoking have any personal relevance to themselves.

Does this relate back to the levels of awareness that you were just talking about?

A.   Right.  From a general sort of just awareness to a general acceptance or belief to the personalized acceptance.

And what they were showing is well, even still in 1980 there's some people, you know, that really don't even have a general awareness of what's going on.  But even if you assume that basically acceptance of that in terms of personalized acceptance of the risk as they document, because they actually sort the data by

different categories, whether somebody is a smoker or a nonsmoker, whether they're a heavy smoker or a lighter smoker.

And as you might expect, the heavy smokers tend to have the most denial or rationalizations around their smoking and seem less -- more immune to the health message that was coming out.

And they talk about the massive amount of new information because there have been so many Surgeon General's Report.  Every report would add new --

MR. GERAGHTY:  This is now no longer responsive to the question that was posed.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  I lost the question there, so let me ask just to break it up for -- at least for me, if not others.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Sure. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And I asked you, Dr. Cummings, about the levels of awareness and you talked about that, but it sounded like you were talking about the Surgeon General's Reports coming out.

We saw a reference to increasing information about health, and throughout the 1970s, into the 1980s, do we in general see throughout the United States more information out there about the dangers of smoking?

A.   Yes, we do.

Q.   And people -- would you expect, based on your review of this evidence, Lamar Danielson, to be immune to that message as well, or would he be somebody you would expect to know that there's a message out there about the hazards of smoking?

A. I would expect him to know that message coming out. You know, he was part of the population and would be exposed to that information.

Q.   It indicates the Federal Trade Commission says although the cigarette manufacturers no longer claim cigarette smoking has affirmative health benefits, they continue to argue that it's not been proven that smoking has any detrimental health effects.

First of all, is that an accurate assessment of the industry message in the 1980s?

A.   It's accurate in the sense that the cigarette manufacturers basically denied the health risks of smoking.

asked about the health message.  Is there any reason, based on your review of evidence in this case, to believe that somehow Lamar Danielson was immune to the industry message any more than he would have been immune to the health message?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, that's calling for

speculation.

he would be immune to the message from the industry

MR. SCHULTZ: BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q. If you look at -- have you looked, or are you aware generally, of the amount of money -- and I don't mean particular figures, but the amount of money or resources that went into the Surgeon General's message to the public in the 1970s and 1980s versus the amount of money that went into the cigarette industry's messages to the public?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And how do they compare?

A.   Well, there is more spent on advertising in a day than the Surgeon General's Committee or Surgeon General's office would spend in an entire year.

So the cigarette companies were outspending them, you know, 365 to 1 basically.  So as I say, it's an elephant on one side of the scale and a grain of sand on the other in terms of what information was really getting out there.

MR. SCHULTZ:  If we could look over please,

Ryan, at Page 94 of the report. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   It indicates that in contrast to the current warning, at this time would that be the 1970 warning that we already saw?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Cigarette advertisements present information about smoking in a highly effective manner.  They communicate their message about smoking in a variety of attention-getting frequently-changing formats. The ads are rich in thematic imagery, associating smoking with, among other things, outdoor activities, athletics, individualism and achievement. They are frequently filled with rugged vigorous attractive healthy looking people living energetic lives full of success and athletic achievement, free from any health hazards.

First of all, would you agree based on your work in this area with the FTC's characterization of

cigarette advertising in its time?

A.   Yes, it's consistent with the FTC's characterization as well as what we saw from Philip Morris themselves as they describe Marlboro Country, and the imagery related to that, which was so key to the sales of Marlboro cigarettes.

Q.   And has it changed, Dr. Cummings, from the 1967 report where you read that lengthy description about cigarette advertising?

A.   It has changed dramatically.  It's, you know, means as where companies can market and so on have been reduced, but you still see a fair amount of advertising when you go into point of sale.  That's pretty much the pack, and point of sale and direct consumer marketing, which are the main vehicles for marketing today.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Ryan, can you please pop over to

page 95, the next page of the report. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Still talking about advertising, Dr. Cummings. The FTC indicates cigarettes are the most heavily advertised product in America.  I think you just said that a little while ago?

product.  This figure is several hundred times greater than the amount the government spends on public service announcements on smoking hazards.

Let me stop there.  Are you familiar with PSAs, or public service announcements, where people come on and try to convince, you know, the public please don't smoke, that sort of thing?

A.   Yeah, the ads that appear at 2:00 in the morning.

Q.   All right.

A. When you get the free space from the television station.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to object as nonresponsive. THE COURT:  Again, let me ask you to -- I think

it was nonresponsive, so I will strike the response.

Ask you to re-ask your question. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Are you familiar with the antismoking PSAs, public service announcements, from around this time?

A.   Sure.  Very familiar with them.

Q.   Can you identify a couple of the more well-known ones?

A. Sure. Well, there was Larry Hagman would do an ad. He was on -- you know, Dallas and he did an ad for, I believe, the cancer society urging people to try to

quit for the Great American Smokeout.

So the cancer society would sponsor an ad like that.  Ed Asner, I think, did an ad like that.  You had an ad from Sammy Davis.  It was a little bit later.  But I think Yul Brynner was probably the first.  He did an ad for the cancer society before he passed away.  Sort of a post mortem ad urging people not to take up smoking.

Q.   Is it those PSAs, Dr. Cummings, that the FTC is referring to here when they say that the advertising expenditure is several hundred times greater than the amount government spends on public service announcements on smoking hazards?

A.   Well, the ones I talked about were volunteer. The government actually did publish a few anti -- you know, PSAs.  They had one I think it was a Star Wars one.  R2D2 did a little ad urging children not to take up smoking.

And they were talking about what they were spending.  It's expensive to make an ad, because I've been involved in doing PSAs.  And they probably cost about 100 or $200,000 to put together, and that was a big part of the budget for the office on, you know, the National Clearinghouse at the time.

Q.   And in fact, the next sentence says national

commission on smoking and public policy reported in 1978 that the tobacco industry spent more on advertising cigarettes in one day than the then National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health, the government1 s primary agency working in this area, spent in one year. Is that what you were referring to a moment ago?

A.   Yes, it was.

Q.   Cigarette advertising expenditures have grown substantially over the last decade and continue to grow. Did cigarette advertising expenditures continue to grow throughout the 1980 and 90s as well?

A.   It did.  Actually, even after the cigarette ads went off of television, they actually just put that money into other forms of advertising, point of sale and magazines, billboards.  Half of all billboards in 1980 were cigarette ads in the United States.

So they just redirected the spending and spending went up.  They were actually spending more on their advertising after.  And as you indicated, 1980 up to 1990, their expenditures went up and FTC Reports would track the advertising expenditures.

Q.   And if we look over at Page 96 of this report, they indicate that in 1979 two of the top five advertisers in magazines in the U.S. were cigarette companies.  Philip Morris was also among the top five

What effect would the pervasiveness of this sort of advertising have -- of course, I'm speaking of Lamar Danielson, but to an addicted smoker generally? A.   Well, every --

MR. GERAGHTY:  And object, Your Honor.  That's calling for speculation.  Beyond the scope.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.  Thank you.

THE WITNESS: Yeah, the effect of advertising to somebody who's a smoker is a cue to smoke. You see the ads, remind you as a smoker -- we use them as cues in our cue reactivity studies that look at the effects of things that trigger thoughts, urges to smoke. And so they just reinforce the smoking act for somebody who's addicted. So you sell more cigarettes that way.

does magazines and newspapers.  The top five outdoor advertisers in 1975 were the five largest cigarette companies.  Almost half of all billboards in the United States advertise cigarettes.

You just alluded to that a few minutes ago, I think.

A.   That's right.

Q.   Would those have the same cuing or triggering effect for smokers that advertisements in newspapers and magazines would have?

A.   Sure.  I mean, it's just pervasive.  And, again, a lot of the advertising for the most popular brands.  So for Philip Morris that would be Marlboro. That was one of the most heavily-advertised brands.

could look over at Page 133. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And the FTC concludes, "While most consumers know that smoking is linked to cancer, a number of people still do not believe the link between smoking and any type of cancer.

Q.   "Did not know of the cancer risk.  This evidence projected nationally suggests that tens of millions of Americans do not know that smoking causes cancer."

And is that the situation, Dr. Cummings, in 1980, 1981 when this report comes out?

A.   Yes.  Yankelovich was the polling firm used by Brown & Williamson, just like Roper was the firm used by Philip Morris.

proven that smoking causes lung cancer.

Once we're up to 1979 or 1980, Dr. Cummings, who is funding -- who's the only voice in America saying that cigarette smoking doesn't cause lung cancer?

A.   It's the cigarette companies.  So Philip Morris and the other cigarette companies were the group that was basically denying the fact that cigarette smoking caused -- did not cause cancer.

Q.   And according to Yankelovich, at least cited by the FTC, does this show that about four out of ten smokers still don't think they've proven the link as late as 1981?

A.   Yes.

conclusions said cigarette advertising does not disclose material health and safety information.  Many smokers remain unaware of the very basic fact that smoking is hazardous among other things.  The current warning is not effective for overcoming that perception problem." Was that the FTC's ultimate conclusion?

A.   It was.  It basically said that consumers, you know, while they might have had a general awareness of the health risks, they didn't really internalize that risk and that, you know, remedial action was needed.

Q.   In what year in the United States is the year where the most cigarettes were ever sold in the U.S. history?

A.   Peaked in 1981.  So in terms of total sales, 1981 was their peak sales periods because they picked up that baby boom generation that came through.  So even though prevalence was beginning to bend down slightly in the '70s, overall sales continued to go up to 1981.

Q.   Because the population is getting bigger?

A.   Population is getting bigger, yeah.

Q.   And I asked you a moment ago, did Philip Morris take a look at the '81 FTC Report?

A.   They did.

Q.   Including the stuff that we just looked at on consumer knowledge that you've described to the jury?

A.   Correct.  They looked at this report as a very detailed analysis of the '81 FTC Report and present internally to the company their conclusions about the validity of the findings from the FTC Report, where they basically acknowledge that the findings were accurate.

Q.   Now, I think you've already told the jury rotating warnings eventually went onto the packs; is that correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And are those the warnings that are on the packs even today?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Did the '81 FTC Report have anything to do with the '85 warnings?  Was there a connection between them?

A.   Sure.  I mean, that was the beginning.  The FTC recommended remedial action.  One of the remedial actions is that they needed to strengthen the warnings and be more specific about the health risks associated with cigarette smoking like, you know, saying lung cancer and other particular kinds of diseases.

And so that was a process that began in '81. There were hearings that went on.  The law passed in '84 by Congress, and then the new warnings which were adopted appeared on the cigarette packs starting in 1985.

Q.   At this point had Lamar Danielson -- how long would he have been smoking by the time the new warnings go on?

A.   You know, basically he would have been smoking for almost 20 years at that point.

Q.   And would he have been -- I guess in '85 he's about nine years shy of his cancer diagnosis?

A.   That's right.

Q.   In the evidence that you looked at in terms of Lamar Danielson ever mentioning warnings, do you remember any evidence where he said something to anybody about a cigarette warning?

A.   Yeah, there's testimony I think with some coworkers about the warnings on the -- the new warnings, which in the 19- -- mid-1980s, so I assume it would have been the rotating warnings.

So, yeah, he certainly -- at least according to coworkers -- is talking about the fact that there are warnings there.

Q.   Different warnings on different packs?

A.   Different warnings on different packs and it corresponds to when he's, you know, making a number of quit attempts.

Q.   Is this the first time there are different warnings on different packs, 1985?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did the industry --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, let's just take a look, if

we can, Ryan, at the next slide. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Tell the jury, if you would -- we brought it up a few minutes ago, but I want to make sure they recall who Bob Heimann, Robert Heimann was.

A.   Robert Heimann was the president of American Tobacco back in the early '50s.  American Tobacco was a top-selling cigarette company in America.  Lucky Strike, Chesterfield -- or Pall Mall and Lucky Strike were their big brands.

Anyway, he, in 1986, was asked to give a deposition as the most knowledgeable person about sort of the advertising of cigarettes by American Tobacco, and he gave this deposition and he was asked about warning labels and the Tobacco Institute and a whole variety of things in this deposition.

Q.   And that -- you anticipated my next question. In the same deposition, does he talk about the Tobacco Institute, the founding of the Tobacco Institute, for example?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was he involved in the Tobacco Institute?

A.   Yes, he was.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And let's just play the video,

Ryan.

(On video.) * * * *

QUESTION:  I'm going to show you what's marked as Plaintiff's Exhibit 17, which is simply a package of Pall Mall cigarettes currently being sold.

Can you identify that as a package of Pall Malls?

ANSWER:  Yes, sir.

QUESTION:  And would you read the warning that's placed on that for us, please?

ANSWER:  Surgeon General's warning:  Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health.

QUESTION:  That is not a warning that is voluntarily placed there by American Tobacco, is it?

ANSWER:  No, it is not.

QUESTION:  Would you put that warning there if Congress didn't require it?

ANSWER:  No.

QUESTION:  And the reason is simply American disagrees with the warning, doesn't it?

ANSWER:  We certainly do.

QUESTION:  You don't think they harm smokers so there's no reason to put any warning on them, do you?

ANSWER:  We believe our product is not injurious to health.

QUESTION:  As far as -- as far as you're concerned, is the Surgeon General simply wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?

ANSWER:  I would use the term "misguided."

QUESTION:  If he's misguided, then, I take it that your opinion is he's wrong?

ANSWER:  I was simply trying to be polite about it.

QUESTION:  Okay.  But not being polite about it, in your opinion, he's wrong?

ANSWER:  Wrong.

QUESTION:  Congress is wrong in requiring these warnings, correct?

ANSWER:  We do not think they're justified.

QUESTION:  So they're wrong?

ANSWER:  They're wrong.

Q. Now, Mr. Heimann, as mentioned in the video, was with American Tobacco Company. You just told the jury he was also in the Tobacco Institute.

Did Philip Morris and American Tobacco Company and the other cigarette companies use the Tobacco Institute to oppose the 1985 warnings when they were proposed in Congress? A.   Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object for the reasons we discussed earlier and move to strike. MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, I'm pulling up a document right now consistent with what we talked about.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll permit you to pull up the document; but, again, the point is not whether or not they have a right to promote or oppose. That's a protected right, as I discussed at the sidebar.  But if you have anything else, then you may consider that.

My concern is your question was did they oppose it.  And on that alone, I would be sustaining the objection; but I will permit you to present your next piece of evidence, and then I'll determine whether or not I have to go back and instruct the jury with a curative instruction.  Thank you.

Your

Q.
	I think the first question
		I asked was whether
	
American
	Tobacco and Philip Morris and the other
			

companies got together
		to oppose the
	warnings,
	

Dr. Cummings.

	Can you give
	me just a minu

Q.
	First of all,
	can you tell
	the jury who Sheldon
	
Sommers was?
		
	
	

A.

California; but he served on the -- as the chairperson of the scientific advisory board for the Council for Tobacco Research, which was the jointly-funded research organization that was started in 1954 and funded by Philip Morris and other cigarette companies.

So he served in -- on the committee and then eventually became the chair of that committee.

Q.   And when he came before Congress, Dr. Cummings, did he talk about animal studies and other scientific studies on whether smoking causes cancer?

A.   No.  He basically talked about the warning labels, because there was -- as I described, after the FTC Report came out, there were hearings -- government hearings held about the need to -- for remedial action and strengthening the warnings; and in 1983, he appeared in front of a Congressional panel to give his positions.

This is -- I think is -- from a press release from the Tobacco Institute, summarizing those who were opposing the warning labels.  So they were suggesting that leading doctors -- turns out these leading doctors were on the payroll on the companies.

Q.   And did they communicate at that hearing, Dr. Cummings, the message that there's no link between smoking and lung cancer?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was that a true and accurate science at the time accepted by anybody who wasn't on the payroll of a cigarette company?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object to the form

of that question and to the doctor offering that

opinion.  Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT:  I will overrule that objection.

A.   It was inconsistent with the evidence that cigarette smoking caused disease.  So both from the large mass of the scientific community, as well as the internal business documents of the cigarette companies, which had determined by 1958 that cigarette smoking was a cause of cancer. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And so we're clear, was Dr. Sommers talking on behalf of the industry as the head of the CTR, scientific director of the CTR?

A.   Yes, he was.

Q.   And would it be inconsistent -- I asked you about the science.  I want to be very clear.  Would it be inconsistent with what the cigarette industry, including Philip Morrison's own internal documents, show about their knowledge of the harms of smoking to get up before Congress and deny a link between smoking and cancer?

A.   Yes, it would be inconsistent with what was known internally by the companies at that time.

Q.   If we look back over at Page 1, you mentioned this was out of a Tobacco Institute press release.  And they say, and this is --

MR. SCHULTZ:  If we can go back up, Ryan, and

see the date, please. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   March 17th, 1983.  So it was -- how does that relate to the date of the warnings we have been talking about, the new warnings coming out?

A.   Well, there were hearings.  As is typical, it takes government a long time to get things done.  There were hearings done in '83, and eventually Congress got around to voting on the law in 1984.  And the -- that was actioned, actually showing up with the new warnings in '85.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And if we look down at the quote, please, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   "A battery of scientific experts told a congressional committee today the findings set forth in a bill to change cigarette warnings, as one of them put it, is unsubstantiated and misleading."

Was that the cigarette industry's response to

the effort to change the warnings?

A.   Yes, because the Tobacco Institute spoke on behalf of their members.

Q.   "The five men challenged testimony given a week ago by antismoking organizations of" -- do you know offhand, Dr. Cummings, any of the organizations who might have spoken at the hearings they're referring to as "antismoking"?

A.   Well, the American Cancer Society.  The -- I believe the Office of National Clearinghouse, which was the Surgeon General's office, among others.  Those are two that I know of.

Q.   And they mention "the new warnings would declare smoking to be a cause of various ailments and a matter of addiction."

So was there originally a proposed addiction warning?

A.   Yes, there was.

Q.   Did that eventually make it onto the packs?

A.   No, it did not.

Q.   "The U.S." -- excuse me.

addiction but turns out we now know he was on the payroll of the cigarette companies receiving what they referred to as special project money, which is a category of funding that was really selected by lawyers inside the companies to fund certain scientists, and they often used the special project scientist to appear in public forums by Congressional hearings to speak on their behalf.

Q.   And then would the Tobacco Institute take what these people who were on the payroll say in the hearings and put it into press releases to support their position?

A.   That's right.

MR. SCHULTZ:  If we could, please, Ryan, go

back to the PowerPoint. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Do we have a letter as well, Dr. Cummings, from R.J. Reynolds setting forth their position on the new warnings?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And David Fishel is identified as a vice president public relations for R.J. Reynolds, LP3585. MR. GERAGHTY:  Defendant's (inaudible). MR. SCHULTZ:  You're right. MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay.  I've got it.  Thank you.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Mr. Fishel says, "The fact is, in two years of congressional hearings on cigarette warning labels, many scientists said the issue of causation was an open question."

Do you know what issue of causation Mr. Fishel is referring to there, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Whether cigarette smoking causes disease like lung cancer.

Q.   "We believe the public record of those hearings clearly shows the evidence presented did not justify the claims of causation contained on the new labels.  The wording on the new labels expresses the opinions of the Surgeon General, not the opinions of the tobacco industry."

Did Philip Morris or any other cigarette manufacturer say something different publicly than R.J. Reynolds the position it staked out here?

A.   No.  This was the position I've seen internal documents from Philip Morris that expresses the exact same opinion.

Q.   Did that change at any time between 1985 and Mr. Danielson's death ten years later?

A.   No, it did not.

Q.   I want to bring us back briefly, Dr. Cummings,

to Marlboro. We talked about the -- the images of Marlboro. I want to ask you about the advertising amounts for Marlboro over time.

Can you tell the jury what "NCI monograph" is, briefly?

A.   Sure.  It's a book.  They ask people to write certain chapters in the book and then they draw conclusions based on it.  And the NCI, the National Cancer Institute, created a monograph series on topics related to tobacco and health.  Monograph 19 was on the topic of tobacco advertising and antitobacco advertising.  So it is a huge document about 7 or 800 pages long.  I was a reviewer of the entire document. So when they put it all together, I had to go through it and read it and comment on it.

And it's a nice compilation of information, particularly cigarette ad spending, and this is talking -- this particular chart is on Marlboro advertising for various periods, this showing 1972 to '95, and the average amount spent per year which works out, I think I had indicated, close to about 130 million a year.

Of course, that's adjusted to dollars.  I think this came out -- the Monograph came out in 2009.  It's 2006 dollars they did the adjustment to.

Q.
	And the 1.9 billion, is that
	only for
	the
	15

years that the NCI reported here?
		
	
	

A.
	Yes.
 MR. GERAGHTY:  It's 23.
	
	
	

BY MR.
	SCHULTZ:
	
	
	

Q.
	Mr. Geraghty didn't follow me
	Let me
	i  ask
	you,

Dr. Cummings, in case there's any confusion.
			
	


	There's a 23-year span here,
	but they
	only
	

report
	15 years --
	
	
	

A.
	That's right.
	
	
	

Q.
	--of that 23 years?
	
	
	

A.
	Correct.
	
	
	

Q.
	And is that what your figure
	is based
	on -
	-

your ma
	th is based on?
	
	
	

A.
	Yes.
	
	
	

Q.
	Okay.  The FTC, did it continue to report
			on

adverti
	sing over time by the cigarette
	industry of
		their

product
	s?
	
	
	

A.
	Yes.  It's mandated by law to
	put out
	an annual
	
report.
	
	
	
	

Q.
	And without going through it
	all in great
		

detail,
	is it fair to say expenditures
	were on
	the
	rise

through
	out the '80s, into the '90s?
	
	
	

A.
	It is fair to say that.  It's
	accurate
	i  to
	say

that.

Q.   Coming to the very end on this marketing issue, Dr. Cummings, before we turn to the conspiracy, are you familiar with the direct marketing handbook that's up on the screen from Philip Morris?

A.   I am.

Q.   And is this, in fact, an internal Philip Morris marketing document?

A.   It is.  Early '90s.

Q.   It indicates "direct marketing still is fundamentally a way for an advertiser to communicate directly with consumers and central to the unique advantages of direct marketing" --

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm sorry, Mr. Geraghty.  It's

6855, Page 3.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Got it.  Thank you. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   -- "central to the unique advantages of direct marketing is its ability to reach consumers on an individual basis."

Did Lamar Danielson participate in direct marketing with Philip Morris?

A.   Yes, he did.

Q.   And did he collect -- describe for the jury briefly how that worked.  What sort of program are we talking about?

A.   Well, it's -- actually, direct marketing campaigns are ways to build loyalty to keep you smoking that brand.  They often will send you coupons for the brand.  Marlboro Miles, which was the program that he was participating in, based on my review of the evidence in this case, you know, incentivized smokers to turn in their UPC codes, the Marlboro Miles which were on the side of the packs, and then you would accumulate a certain amount of points, and then you could turn those in for gifts of, you know -- and they had all kinds of things from clothing to radios and all kinds of gifts. And they would communicate with you regularly with mailings to your home, including birthday gifts.  They had used that as a trigger to send you a birthday announcement, and then you would get coupons off. Sometimes you'd get rewarded for signing other people up for the program.

And this is a very effective way to -- for addicted smokers, to encourage them to keep smoking more.  It's a -- you sort of get extra bonuses for your smoking, and it's incentivizing somebody to smoke more, collect more miles.  You get more, you know, prizes.

Q.   And are these examples, Dr. Cummings, of a marketing campaign, specifically involving Lamar Danielson?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Do you know what years these materials were sent to Mr. Danielson?

A.   Yes, I do.  1992, I believe, up through 1995. Q.   Including the year he died? A.   Correct.

Q.   I'm going to skip over this which talks about the incentivizing program.

MR. SCHULTZ:  On the assumption, Your Honor, that we're reaching the lunch break, I've got one more slide after this one [sic]. THE COURT:  We had lunch.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I need a lunch break.  The afternoon break.

THE COURT:  We are reaching a break. (Laughter.) BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Well, let me ask you about this.  We've only got two left on this.

The -- the Marlboro Adventure Team program, is that one of these similar to the Marlboro Miles program you were just describing?

A.   Yeah.  It was actually part of it, and you would get Adventure Team materials, and they actually had a magazine that they would send you, and they were,

you know, incentivizing.  If you got enough, you could join these contests and win the Adventure Team excursion, which were fabulous, you know, excursion trips and so on for Marlboro.

Q.   And this particular slide, does this come from an internal Philip Morris document talking about the history of Marlboro and its marketing?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And indicating that "the Marlboro Adventure Team was hugely successful.  Yet despite its efforts, market conditions in 1993 dictated the need for an even more aggressive measure to regain valuable category share points valued at approximately 500 million per point."

What are they referring to there with "category share points?"  Is that market share?

A.   That's market share that they're talking about. So they're telling you one point of market share is worth a half a billion dollars to the company.  And, you know, at this time in the early 1990s, Marlboro had 30.7 percent of the market overall, a higher share, by the way, if you look at certain age groups.

Q.   Would that, Dr. Cummings, reflect the success of Marlboro's marketing efforts over time?

A.   Sure.  You know, 31 times 500 million is a lot

of dollars.  You're talking about over $15 billion for that particular brand just here in the United States of America.

Q.   And is this a 1995 document from the year Mr. Danielson died --

A.   Yes.

Q. -- indicating that "Marlboro lived up to its promise, was well on its way to becoming the greatest success story in tobacco and marketing history."

I think I asked you on the video, is that just a bunch of hype, or is that accurate?

A.   That's accurate.

Q.   Had Philip Morris admitted by the time that Mr. Danielson died that smoking was addictive?

A.   No.

Q. Had it admitted that smoking Marlboro caused lung cancer?

A.   No.

Q.   Can there be any doubt -- Dr. Cummings, as we move into the conspiracy, I want to close out on addiction and marketing.  Can there be any doubt in your mind, based on your review of this report, that Mr. Danielson lived his entire life surrounded by images of Marlboro and other cigarette advertising?

A.   No.  There's no doubt.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Stepping down is a little more difficult.

MR. SCHULTZ:  So it's not out of keeping with our projections for where we'd be in trial.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  Well, that's my question. I'm not -- I don't consider it bad news or good news.  It's just where are we in terms of projection of how the trial is progressing?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think we're doing very well, Judge.  And if things go as I intend, depending on the length of Mr. Geraghty's cross, we may be done Thursday.  We'11 certainly be done by Friday and we may well be done before then.

MR. GERAGHTY:  We'll raise that issue.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm -- I don't know where we're going.  I mean, let's see -- he can be testifying at 2:00 tomorrow afternoon for all I know, depending on how it goes.  I'm sorry, Judge, for the colloquy between counsel.

the weekend about how everything would progress. Mr. Schultz's best estimate, which I'm not holding him to obviously, is that we hopefully will get Dr. Cummings done by the end of the day tomorrow. There's a chance we could go a little faster than that.  Maybe it'll go a little bit slower.

I believe they have Dr. Burns.  I believe there's also a fact witness, Jerry Pate.  Then we have Mrs. Danielson and her children.

What I was told --

THE COURT:  Is Burns a -- by deposition?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Dr. Burns is live.  He's an expert witness.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thanks.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And what we talked about was that Mr. Schultz believes that he doesn't think he'll take all day Friday.  He could finish by the end of the day Thursday, but he'll finish by Friday.

That left us in a situation where our addiction expert Dr. Dorce might have to start testifying on Friday afternoon and then continue on Monday.  She has two young children, and we talked about coming to Your Honor and -- and asking if it was okay if we could just push her to start on Monday morning so she wouldn't have to -- she lives in West Palm

Beach.

So she would have to come here on Thursday, testify, travel back to West Palm Beach, come back here, do all that.

They agreed that if Your Honor was okay with it, what we would do is have her testify first thing on Monday morning.  We don't believe that she'll take much past the lunch break.  And then it would be up to Your Honor, depending upon at what point we broke on Monday, whether you'd want us to close on Monday or close first thing on Tuesday.

But we think we're on track to at the very latest, even if Your Honor agreed with this plan, to close first thing on Tuesday morning.  And we thought we would -- we should share it with you obviously today.

THE COURT:  Yeah, and, you know, the discussion is perfectly appropriate.

We -- my thought is that with Cummings, your approach to Cummings has been different than what I've seen before so I don't know exactly how much this next segment is going to take.

But I'm kind of thinking that we should be done with him tomorrow at some point in time.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think that's right.

THE COURT:  I don't see it going into Wednesday.  And then on -- because of -- I don't know Burns and I don't know in terms of the length of that testimony.  That's really the unknown.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, I will say, and, again, I can't speak for Mr. Schultz, but by the time Dr. Cummings is done, we will have, you know, sort of plowed virtually every piece of ground that is conceivable, so I think that we will certainly be raising cumulative objections if Dr. Burns were to get into anything that Dr. Hurt or Dr. Cummings have already addressed.

But my understanding is because of the potential for that to happen, Dr. Burns was perhaps going to be a little bit more narrow than what we've seen with the first two experts so far.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, we talked about this, Judge.  He's in a different medical specialty.  He will be more narrow.  I don't think his direct would be two hours.  Two and a half maybe, three.

MR. BOWDEN:  I would say three.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Three hours.  And we're working on trimming it based on -- Mr. Bowden has had the luxury of seeing what each -- how this has all come out with Hurt and Cummings and trimming as we go.

He will still come in and give the opinions he's going to give from his specialty, but you're not going to see him doing what Dr. Cummings is doing. So. . .

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. SCHULTZ:  The short answer is, I think, if we're talking about a couple-hour cross, we're talking less time to direct and cross Dr. Burns than I will have Dr. Cummings on direct.  Won't be nearly as long.

THE COURT:  Well, let's just for the sake of discussion say that Cummings is off the stand by tomorrow afternoon, and then Burns is on the stand Wednesday.  And that Burns takes two-thirds of the day on Wednesday on direct and cross.

And so then we turn to family members.

We're -- and you're wrapping it at that time.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That tells me �

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's the afternoon �

half-day -- or 60-percent-of-the-day witness.  And that's what I'm -- I'm wondering if I'm missing something there.

MR. GERAGHTY:  No, you're not missing anything. I think the concern is that I don't know how lengthy -- Mrs. Danielson will probably be longer is my anticipation than any of the other fact witnesses.

And I think the concern is if they do dip into Friday, if we don't start Dr. Dorce first thing Friday morning, then there is a risk that she's got to be here Friday and still be on the stand by Monday.  And that's the concern we have, Your Honor.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And I think we'll know a lot more tomorrow, Judge, once we see how long Dr. Cummings goes on both sides.

My cross of Dr. Dorce could be long, but I'll say in fairness -- because she covers a lot, but in fairness, I've read her prior transcripts and she doesn't -- if I'm not having to impeach her it may not be -- we will get her on and off in less than a day for sure.  And I do predict, Judge, we're going to be done with our case by Thursday afternoon.  So I think that's possible.

THE COURT:  She just needs to be available for

Thursday afternoon.  I mean, I'm with you.  I don't want to split up your expert witness' testimony.  I think that's -- you know, you don't deserve that. You know, it needs to be presented both in direct and cross-examination and rebuttal.

And so I'll work with you on that.  But frankly, I'm -- I'm thinking you're on the road to getting the evidence in, in this case, to -- through your expert witness through Friday.

And if she's available for Friday night -- I hate her to say oh, okay, I don't have to come until Monday, and so she makes plans for Friday, and then she's not available for Friday and we're sitting around with nothing else, you know, going on.

MR. GERAGHTY:  We'll advise and �

THE COURT:  Thank you.  I think that will take care of it.  Thank you.

We'll be in recess.  Why don't you guys take about ten minutes?

THEREUPON, the following proceedings were had and taken at 3:23 p.m.:

(Break taken from 3:12 p.m. to 3:23 p.m.) K. MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D., MPH, having been previously duly sworn or affirmed, continued to testify under oath as follows:

THE COURT DEPUTY:  Remain seated.  Court is reconvened.

THE COURT:  Plaintiff ready to proceed?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Defense ready to proceed?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  All right.  What happened to those designations on that deposition that you plowed through with Judge Bell for two days?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, Judge, we �

MR. GERAGHTY:  Play it.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That was a timing issue as I, in fact, explained to Mr. Nease before the trial; and the way things are timing out, I don't think we're going to be seeing Dr. Farone's deposition.  It was four hours long.  I tried to cut it down.  We never got back together on the cuts.  I just don't want to play a four-hour video, which I'm sure everybody appreciates.

THE COURT:  He had to deal with all those designations and you're not going to use it.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Might tell him.  Is this at the end of what you just gave me? MR. SCHULTZ:  Yeah. THE COURT:  Okay.  Ready?

Q.   Welcome back, Dr. Cummings.  Topic 3, Philip Morris's concealment, conspiracy, and false health controversy.  We talked about this a little bit earlier.

If we pull up the next slide -- maybe the easiest way to do this rather than reading all of this on the slide, could you just give the jury a brief sort of overview of what we're going to be hearing about, a sort of roadmap, if you would?

A.   Sure.  A lot of the epidemiologic and animal

study evidence on the health hazard of smoking was accumulating in the early 1950s.  This caused concern to the companies; and, in fact, their cigarette sales dropped for the first time in 1953.  First time since the Great Depression.

So every year they had an increase in sales. It dropped as this evidence began to come out in medical journals and medical conventions and so on; and it resulted in a call by Paul Hahn to the other heads of the cigarette companies to get together at the Plaza Hotel in early -- or in late December 1953, where they basically hatched a plan for communicating information to the public to reassure them it was okay to continue to smoke.

And that campaign resulted in -- they hired a public relations firm, Hill & Knowlton.  They ended up creating an organization called the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which I think I had mentioned before, that later became known as the Council for Tobacco Research.  It's exactly the same organization.

It was run by the heads, the executives of the companies and their lawyers so they had a lawyer committee and an executive committee.

And the Tobacco Institute, which I've described, was created in 1958.  It actually spun off of

the Tobacco Industry Research Committee in 1958.

So during this period from really when they were created in 1953, when they made representations that they would be a serious organization focused on studying the alleged relationship between smoking and health -- what you see is what they actually did -- is, you know, basically become a public relations tool for the company to reassure smokers that it was okay to smoke, denying the health risks of smoking, speaking on behalf of their member organizations, funded proportionately by the sales of the company.

So early on American Tobacco was the No. 1 seller and when they created the organization, you know, by the 1980s and -- and '90s, you've got Philip Morris pretty much running the show because they were the No. 1 company.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object at this point. It's beyond the --

A.   Yes, it does.

Q.   Does it continue through the 1970s, when he's an adult smoking Marlboro cigarettes?

A.   Yes, it does.

Q.   Does it continue in the 1980s -- when he's --you've already told us in your opinion an addicted smoker struggling to quit smoking cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And does it continue after his death in 1995?

A.   Yes, it does.

Q.   We have a slide, Dr. Cummings, on the sources of evidence.  You've told us about the TI documents and the videos you got from the New York attorney general. We've already seen some previously secret records of the industry, including Philip Morris. Will we see more of those?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Industry testimony from previous legal cases. Do we also have public statements by the industry?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Including the Tobacco Institute?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And then some government documents sort of like FTC and other documents like we've seen already?

Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, American, Brown & Williamson, Liggett & Myers, Lorillard, are those all cigarette manufacturers?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Are they otherwise in competition with one another trying to sell more cigarettes than their competitor?

A.   Correct.

Q.   But -- and we'll talk about that.

Now, we have the word they're "fronts."  Whose word is that?

A. That's the companies' own internal words I believe in a document from Dr. Seligman from Philip Morris.  He quoted the word "fronts."

Q.   And those fronts you've already described the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, the Council, which -- is that what became the Council for Tobacco Research?

A.   Right.  They did a name change in March of 1964.  Just to change the name from Tobacco Industry Research Committee to Council for Tobacco Research.

So they -- after the Surgeon General's Report came out, they removed the word "Tobacco Industry" from their title.  And they continued to do essentially the same thing.  In fact, they spent more money on the special projects.  That's where they really come in in 1964, where they were having their lawyers select their research that would be funded.

Q.   And the Tobacco Institute you've already told us about.

Are all three of these funded by Philip Morris and the other manufacturers?

A.   Yes.  Based on proportional sales of cigarettes.  So that's how they divvied it up.

Liggett & Myers, just to be exactly clear, they were invited to the meeting at the Plaza Hotel.  They actually turned down attending and didn't join as part of the conspiracy until 1958, when they joined the Tobacco Institute.

And then they later funded selectively research under the Council for Tobacco Research, primarily the special projects work.

Q.   And before we go back to 1953 and a little bit before, in fact, I'd like to take a look at this document from May of 1972.  It's LP0166.

And we see up in the corner this is from Fred

Panzer to Horace Kornegay.

Can you tell the jury who those gentleman are?

A.   Horace Kornegay was the president of the Tobacco Institute, former Congressman from North Carolina, and he ran the Tobacco Institute.

Fred Panzer is the vice president for the Tobacco Institute.  They're talking in 1972 about sort of the look-back at how successful they had been and what they needed to be doing going forward at that time.

Q.   And the document indicates the strategy.  Are they referring to the conspiracy there?

A.   Yes.  They said, "For nearly 20 years" -- so, you know, 1972 almost dates to the time in 1953 -- "the industry has employed a single strategy to defend itself on three major fronts:  Litigation, politics, and public opinion.

"While the strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed over the years, helping us win important battles, it's only fair to say that it's -- it is not nor was it intended to be a vehicle for victory.

"On the contrary, it's always been a holding strategy consisting of creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it."

You know, sort of normalizing smoking and advocating the public's right to smoke and always with

the refrain of "more research is needed to prove whether cigarettes cause disease."

Q.   And that refrain more research is needed, does that relate in any way to addiction?

A.   Sure.  You know, if you're an addicted smoker, you know, suggesting that the -- you know, that you don't know the answer; that it's a controversy that there are unknowns gives somebody who is an addicted smoker an excuse, a rationale to keep smoking.  And it's exactly who this campaign of doubt was aimed at.  It was aimed at heavy smokers.

Q. And the jury saw this document in opening, Dr. Cummings. And this is LP0313. Mr. Geraghty is pulling his copy up.

Can you describe to the jury who this document is written from and who it's written to?

A.   Sure.  This is another document.  This one is authored by George Weissman.  Again, he was, you know, on the board of directors and involved in sales.  He was really the architect of the Marlboro remake.

And Joe Cullman at this time is now the president of Philip Morris.  He also serves on the Tobacco Institute executive committee, later becomes the president of that committee.

report had been issued.  January 11th, 1964 is when the report came out.  This is about two weeks later, January 29th, and he's saying, you know, "We must in the near future provide some answers which will give smokers a psychological crutch and a self-rationale to continue smoking."

That was under the title PR Campaign, so they're really talking about public relations efforts going forward.

Q.   And would this have been, Dr. Cummings, before Mr. Danielson ever picked up a cigarette, as far as we know?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The jury has seen this graph as well.  I wanted to ask you about this.  I think you may have alluded to it a little bit earlier.

This dip in per capita income -- we see the rise that you described, a little dip back in the Great Depression.  What's happening here when we see this drop around 1951, '52?

A.   Well, again, the evidence, you know, is that smoking is causing disease, there was a compilation of large human health studies that had come out and been published in major medical journals.  Those papers were being discussed in medical meetings.  There was animal

research that was coming out that was demonstrating that painting extracted tar from tobacco on the backs of animals would create tumors.  So there was something in the tar that caused cancer that was consistent with, again, the human studies showing this epidemic of lung cancer that had grown up from the early part of the 20th century up to this point.

And so this caused, you know, a little bit of a -- an effect on those investing in the cigarette companies.  And so cigarette sales began to drop.

Q.   If we go back before that time, Dr. Cummings, and I certainly don't ask you to go through every bit of this -- of it, but can you tell the jury generally what they are seeing here in terms of the timeline? A.   Sure.

Well, it's important to understand the context. There were only a couple hundred cases of lung cancer in the entire United States that, you know, were recorded in the early part of the 20th century.  So it was a pretty rare disease.

But by the 1920s, now there were thousands of cases, and it continued to increase as cigarette sales really took off.  The American blended cigarette really dates from around 1913 with the introduction of Camel.

As cigarette consumption increased, so did the

health effects, and you began to see appearing in the medical journals, here you can see from the early '20s into the '30s and '40s, evidence coming out linking cigarette smoking as a cause of -- of this increase in cancer.

So it's showing even before the 1950s there was evidence appearing.  Of course, some of these articles are appearing in, you know, English journals and also some of them are occurring in foreign journals.  We didn't have the Internet back then.  So you, you know, often had to read a different language in order to see what was being written in Italian or German or Spanish. There was a lot of research in Argentina on the health effects of cigarette smoking.

Q.   And who did the research in Argentina?

A.   Well, Dr. Roffo was a chemist, and he was really one of the first to develop the protocol for extracting the tar and fractionating the tar and then evaluating the effects on animals and different types of animals and so on.  And he published many of these papers back in the -- you know, the late '20s, '30s, and '40s.  And it was closely tracked by the cigarette companies, like Philip Morris, Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, they were tracking Roffo's work very carefully.

summarized.  Again, some of this is human studies.  Some of it is animal studies.  Some of it's chemistry studies.  So there's an array of things they're looking at.

Q.   And there's one from 1929, "Tobacco smoke is an etiological factor in cancer indicating," according to Philip Morris's summary, "abundant clinical evidence of an etiological role for tobacco."

What does "etiological" mean?

A.   Cause, causal role.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, is this also from the same document?

A.   Yes, it is.

Q.   And is that a reference to the same Dr. Roffo from Argentina that you described just a few minutes ago?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And what did this particular study indicate the study found in the 1936 Philip Morris document?

A.   Well, where you'd see epithelial neoplasms, you're talking about cancer in epithelial cells that developed wherever they had the exposure to the tobacco tar.

Q.   And is this, Dr. Cummings, LP3831, or 3- --yes, 3831, is this from a study by Dr. Roffo himself

here?

A.   Yes, it is.

Q.   And does -- that study, what does it tell us about, at least Dr. Roffo's findings, on carcinomas of the lung in 1936?

A.   It's overwhelmingly occurring in heavy smokers. About 90 percent of the lung cancers are occurring in heavy smokers; less than 10 percent in the nonsmokers.

Q.   And we've got two documents on the next slide, Doctor, and this is LP0395 and LP0579.

Are you familiar with these two documents, first a Brown & Williamson document and second an RJR document?

A.   Yes.  These are internal business company documents.  I wasn't familiar with them until the internal documents became available in the late 1990s, but it's clear that Brown & Williamson in 1953 had actually isolated a particular chemical, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon called Benzo(a)pyrene, that had been theorized at the time to be the cause of these tumors that happened in the animal experiments that had not been isolated from cigarette smoke.

So this is the earliest study that we see that actually one of the cigarette companies had isolated Benzo(a)pyrene.

Q.   And let me ask you about that.

You said it's Brown & Williamson, and they say there's been a partial isolation and identification of a carcinogenic hydrocarbon, and I think the jury has heard already.  But what does "carcinogenic" mean?

A.   Cancer-causing.

Q.   And that was, as I understood you, within the labs of Brown & Williamson back in 1952?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, the second document --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Do you need a moment,

Mr. Geraghty?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I went and found it. MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Tell the jury, if you would, first of all, who authored the document that we see an excerpt of the conclusions from on the bottom?

A.   Sure.  This is a February 1953 document, the one on the bottom there.  It's the conclusion from Claude Teague.  Claude Teague, we've heard about before, worked at R.J. Reynolds.  He was hired at Reynolds in 1951.  And one of the first tasks he was given was to do a summary of the science on smoking and health.

And he summarizes the research on chemistry,

animal experiments, and human clinical studies for R.J. Reynolds.  And his conclusion is that, you know, this rapid increase in lung cancer that is clearly due to some carcinogenic stimuli in the environment closely parallels the increase in cigarette smoking.  And he says, "The studies of clinical data," that's the human studies that had been done, "tend to confirm the relationship between heavy and prolonged tobacco smoking and incidents of cancer of the lung."

He said, "Extensive, though, inconclusive testing of tobacco substances on animals indicates the probable presence of carcinogenic agents in those substances."

And he points out that one worker has identified known carcinogens in tobacco prilesate [phonetic], which is the tar that you get.

Q.   And did Brown & Williamson and R.J. Reynolds join with Philip Morris among others in forming this conspiracy that we'll hear about later in this year, 1953?

A.   Yeah.  Later in the year, December 10th, a telegram goes out from Paul Hahn inviting all the cigarette company executives to come to a meeting at the Plaza Hotel.  They meet at the Plaza Hotel on the 14th of December, the 15th of December, the 24th of December,

This is the telegram from Mr. Hahn to Ed Darr, who is the president of R.J. Reynolds and indicates who was invited to the meeting.  And they said all the companies attended except for Liggett & Myers.

Q.   I skipped over a slide, Dr. Cummings, because you made a reference to Mr. Hahn of the American Tobacco Company's telegram.  He mentions in the telegram some highly publicized claims of certain medical men that prompted the telegram; is that right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And would that include the Ernst Wynder or Wynder and Graham study on painting tar on the backs of mice that you've already described to the jury?

A.   Yes.  Dr. Wynder, Graham and Kronenger [phonetic] published a paper in the Journal of Cancer in June of 1953 showing that -- the painting the tar causes the tumors.  The more tar you get a dose response relationship.

And that got picked up widely, was talked about

in medical meetings, but got picked up in the popular press.  And, in fact, LIFE magazine had a whole spread on Dr. Graham's and Wynder's work in LIFE magazine, the centerfold of LIFE magazine in December of 1953. So they knew that was coming.  In fact, Mr. Hahn was actually -- gave a comment in that article in LIFE magazine.

Q.   And if we went back and looked at that per capita chart that we've shown with the dips and rises, and we saw the dipper on 5152, has there, at any point before this time, been a dip in that chart that you could associate with widely published news about the potential health harms of smoking?

A.   No.  The dip really happened in '53.  I mean, there are -- at the end of 1953 and all of a sudden there are cigarettes that really -- their sales had dropped off in that year.  It was a bad year for them because every year they expected to sell more cigarettes.  So they viewed that as a crisis.

Q.   Is that what prompted the telegram you've already shown the jury?

A.   Yes.  The crisis was over their cigarette sales, because they didn't invite their scientists to come along.  What they invited was the heads of the company, and they met at the Plaza Hotel, as I indicated

on December 14th.  The first order of business was to decide what they would do, and they did decide to hire a public relations firm, Hill & Knowlton, one of the largest public relations companies in the United States, and they were employed.  And then the meeting on the 15th was meeting with John Hill and some of the associates from Hill & Knowlton, and there are minutes of those meetings that I've obtained from the historical record that was John Hill's records that were put at the University of Wisconsin.

Q.   And so, Dr. Cummings, we see Brown & Williamson.  Is that the company who had isolated Benzo(a)pyrene in '52?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And R.J. Reynolds, who saw the conclusions from Dr. Teague earlier this year, '53 --

A.   That's right.

Q.   -- Philip Morris and Hill & Knowlton?

described?

A.   Yes.  It indicates who was present, and Parker McComas, who was the president of Philip Morris was there, as was Joe Cullman, Joe Cullman, who later became the president of Philip Morris, as I think I showed in one of the other documents, at the time he was head of a company called Benson & Hedges.  That was later acquired by Philip Morris.

Q.   And looking at the same document, LP0614.  It indicates "Mr. Hahn" �

Is he with American Tobacco?

A.   Correct.

Q.   -- "served as chairman, and the meeting was opened with a general discussion about the recent attacks on cigarette smoking which had been widely publicized.  It was the feeling of those present that the industry could most effectively face this problem by jointly engaging a public relations council.  The task was considered such a specialized nature that an advertising company could not deal with the delicacy that is required."

Let me ask you, first of all, when they say the "recent attacks," is that referring at least in part to the mouse painting study and the other studies that you've already described to the jury?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the public relations council, was that Hill & Knowlton whom you've already described to the jury?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And the document continues:  "It was agreed that the expense of the public relations program would be prorated in accordance with the relative volumes of business of the several companies, and that the Wooten report or something equivalent, would be used as the basis."

Can you describe what this is referring to?

A.   It's how they were going to pay for the public relations program.  They're hiring a public relations firm, the public relations firm will do things for them, and how's that all going to be paid for.  And they based it on their sales.  And Wooten was a -- the reports were really on cigarette sales for all the companies.  Later they used the Maxwell Report, which is basically a -- a group that tracks the sales of -- by companies.

Q.   And did Philip Morris pay its fair share from the very start?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   The document we just saw was dated December 14th of '53, the meeting where they decided to hire public relations counsel, among other things.  And

can you tell the jury what this document background material --

MR. SCHULTZ:  And, Mr. Geraghty, it's LP 0153. The excerpts on this slide are from Pages 1 and Pages 4. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Is this a document generated by the public relations company?

A.   Yes, it's Hill & Knowlton.  You can see the HK there, so it's out of the files of John Hill.

And he's describing the meeting they had with the executives the very next day where they outlined various issues and they talked about, you know, how alarmed they were with their declining stocks, you know, tobacco stocks, and the stock exchange market has caused great concern, in particular because an excess profit tax was coming into place in the next year.

Q.   In these initial documents, Dr. Cummings, do you see any suggestion about concern -- an expression of concern over health of consumers that would be commensurate with the expressions of concern we see over the declining stock prices?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object to that question as leading and argumentative.

THE COURT:  Document speaks for itself.  Thank

you. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, if we go forward, 12/15/53 is the date on this document.  If we look further into this document, do we see more in terms of what the plans are in terms of putting together this public message that they had been hired for?

A.   Yes.  You know, they talk about the current plans for Hill & Knowlton.  And, in fact, they talk about interviews that were being done with the research directors of at least four of the companies.  Three had been done, another was scheduled for completion, that interview, and they summarized those in a later document called the forwarding memo.

They also talk about a white paper that had been put together by Tommy Ross, who was an attorney, a lawyer for American Tobacco.  A white paper which would basically summarize the industry's position on smoking and health, and communicate that to the media and public relations.  That had already been developed by the lawyer and we will see later was executed -- was distributed in April -- starting in April of 1954.

Q.   And it was arranged for Hill & Knowlton, the document says, to interview the scientific directors of all the leading companies.  Did those interviews take

A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And you mentioned the forwarding

memorandum which is LP0185.  Ryan, could we pull a

copy of that up, please? BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Who was the author of this document, Dr. Cummings?

A.   This is Ed Dakin.  Ed Dakin was an employee of Hill & Knowlton.  And he put together the forwarding memo really to try to educate the other members of Hill & Knowlton about their new client, the cigarette industry, and what the challenge was for this public relations campaign going forward.

Q.   And does Mr. Dakin describe the --

MR. SCHULTZ:  If we can go to the second page,

please, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Does he describe the interviews with the research directors?

A.   Yes.  He -- summarizes the interviews that were done with the research directors, and he comments that "The attitude of the men we must directly deal with in the industry is at once interesting and important for us to understand."

That is why notes on the four interviews with research directors are given at some length.  And you'll get from them little real information about lung cancer pro or con, but you'll find some mighty interesting opinions.

One of the men said "It is fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they can't break."  Said another "Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was the first to produce a cancer-free cigarette?  What we could do to competition."

Said another "Suppose that everyone smoked just one cigarette less a day.  That would be maybe 40 billion a year.  And, again, the stock market fall is terrible when you remember dividends are going to be much larger next year without the EPT excess profit tax. "

Q.   And if we look over, Dr. Cummings, on the following page, does Mr. Dakin describe the problem that's facing the industry that Hill & Knowlton needs to address?

A.   Yes.  This is sort of a summary of the challenge.  He says "There's only one problem, confidence and how to establish it, public reassurance and how to create it, in a perhaps long interim when scientific gaps must remain, and most important, how to

free millions of Americans from the guilty fear that is going to arise deep in their biological depths, regardless of any pooh-poohing in logic every time they light a cigarette."

Q.   And I want to ask you with respect to an earlier document, when we see a reference to freeing people from guilt about that's going to arise every time they light a cigarette, how does that relate in terms of addicted smokers based on what we've already heard about addiction?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, the document speaks

for itself.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.  Thank

you.

THE WITNESS:  Denial and rationalization gives

somebody an excuse to light up the next cigarette. MR. SCHULTZ:  And if we can go back, Ryan,

please, to the PowerPoint. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q. That was the forwarding memorandum. Did the companies get back together, I think you told us some other dates as well, but on the 28th of December '53?

A.   They did.  You know, this was sort of the culmination meeting.  They had decided to announce the formation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee,

this jointly funded research group that John Hill, the head of Hill & Knowlton, had insisted they actually create to show they were serious about studying smoking and health and how they were going to pay for it.

And they here in this meeting talk about who was there, how the program would be paid for and where it would be housed.  The Tobacco Industry Research Committee was actually housed in the Empire State Building one floor below the floor of Hill & Knowlton.

Q.   And let me ask you first of all, as we see on the slide, was Mr. McComas, the president of Philip Morris, present again at this meeting at the Plaza Hotel?

A.   Yes, he was.

Q.   And was there a decision made in terms of any approach to take on the public message?

A.   Well, the first thing they did officially as a group was to put out an ad, an ad they called "The Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers."  And they actually reviewed drafts of that ad at this and approved the final version that appeared a few days later actually, January 4th, that ad came out.

And they talked about how they would -- where they would place that ad.  They decided it wouldn't be a public, you know, release, a public relations release;

it would be a paid ad.  And they would put it in major newspapers, like a full-page or a three-quarter page advertisement in major newspapers, about 400 newspapers reaching populations with 25,000 or more, and it would be paid for by the companies.

Q.   And is that what we see reflected in the text of the same document you were just talking about? A.   Yes.

Q.   And did they release the Frank Statement that they were talking about in that document? A.   Yes, they did.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, unless defense counsel has an objection, we'd like to publish a copy of the Frank Statement to the jury. THE COURT:  Any objection? MR. GERAGHTY:  No, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Okay.

No objections other than those previously raised and ruled upon by the Court which are preserved for the record.

A.   Correct.

Q.   And do we see signatures from Mr. McComas of Philip Morris and Mr. Cullman, who would later become president of Philip Morris, on the bottom of this document?

Q.   And so when the industry -- let me ask you this.  This is sort of their official response to the studies that you have been talking about, the mouse painting studies, and everything else, to the public?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what did they tell the public when they finally formulated a message?

A.   Well, they -- they basically acknowledged that recent reports had come out, experiments with mice, having given wide publicity on the theory that cigarette smoking in some way was linked to human lung cancer. Or -- and they basically say that there's distinguished authorities who point out that medical research of recent years indicates many possible causes, and that was true.

authorities of what the cause is, and that was probably

true as well at that time.

But they also say there is no proof that

cigarette smoking is one of the causes and -- and we've

showed you they knew internally.  In fact --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, the question was what did they say in the document.  I would object. It speaks for itself.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Well, the document, let me ask you, they state

in No. 3 that there is no proof that cigarette

smoking --

THE COURT:  If you want to highlight portions of the document you're certainly permitted to do that.  But, I mean, they've -- you've asked me to go ahead and publish.  They each have it.  And rather than just read it through top to bottom, it's not the best use of our time.  If there's anything specifically that you want to highlight please feel free to do that.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Sure.  And the first thing I would like to do, Your Honor, is that No. 3, where it says "no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes."

Q.   Is that consistent with what we've already seen and what else you've seen in terms of what the industry had known or viewed internally before this came out to the public?

A.   It's inconsistent with what the companies knew internally.  You saw the Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, and the Philip Morris tracking studies that they had done.

Q.   And did the industry make a commitment, Dr. Cummings, in this document to accept an interest of people's health as a basic responsibility paramount to every other consideration in their business?

A.   Well, this is what they affirmatively promised the American public.  We say we accept an interest in people's health as a basic responsibility paramount to every other consideration of our business.  We believe the products we make are not injurious to health, and we always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health.

Q.   And we'll look at the evidence, I suppose, on that issue.  If we can look over at the right-hand side.

Did they make a pledge, Dr. Cummings, and I'm looking specifically at No. 1 where they said they're pledging aid and assistance to the research effort into all phases of tobacco use and health.  The joint

financial aid will of course be in addition to what is already being contributed by individual companies.

Is this essentially an entree into discussing the establishment of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what purpose did they ascribe to the Tobacco Industry Research Committee in this document?

A.   Well, they basically said the purpose is a joint industry group, and that the group will be known as the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and they would be independent, and they would study the alleged relationship between smoking and disease, particularly cancer.  And that's what the limit of their authority would be.  In fact that's what they told the Department of Justice in 1954 when they sent them their articles of incorporation.

Q.   And is the TIRC, so that the jury is clear, the same organization that became the CTR in 1964?

A.   Yes, it is.

Q.   And they indicate that in charge of the research activities of the committee would be a scientist of unimpeachable integrity and national repute.  In addition, there will be an advisory board of scientists disinterested in the cigarette industry, a

group of distinguished men from medicine science and education will be invited to serve on this board.  These scientists will advise the committee on its research activities.

Did they in fact, appoint a scientific director and a scientific advisory board?

A.   They did.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And, Ryan, if we can go back to

the PowerPoint. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Is this a slide that helps you -- I understand it's not the simplest thing in the world, Dr. Cummings, but does this help you sort of describe for the jury the structure of the TIRC or CTR as it was renamed?

A.   Sure.  It -- the center column you've got the board of directors is made up of the executive committee -- or each of the cigarette companies, their presidents that served on the executive committee or their designee, as it worked out.

So these were the companies, American Tobacco, Brown & Williamson, and so on, Philip Morris, that were on the executive committee.  There was the law committee, also referred to as the committee of counsel, and they oversaw the hiring of staff for the TIRC and CTR and really managed the policies and statements that

came out.  There's the scientific advisory group that's indicated in the lower left.  They were made up of scientists from various universities, different walks of medicine and science.

And there was scientific directors, and their job was to review the grants that would come to the TIRC, make decisions about which ones had merit, and then make funding recommendations.

It shows you the various chairmen, you know. The executive committee, they would designate various chairpeople at different times.  So that's just giving you a history there.

Q.   Let me stop you there and ask a question about this when we see -- we've already seen Paul Hahn.  Was he the president of American Tobacco?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Mr. McComas, was he the president of Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And who was Mr. Hartnett?

A.   President of Brown & Williamson and he later re- -- when he signed the Frank Statement, a few months later he resigned as president of Brown & Williamson and assumed the role of -- of basically the chairman of the TIRC.

Q.   And throughout its existence, are the chairs of the TIRC/CTR, are these men who are in leadership positions at the highest levels of the companies?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the presidents of the CTR -- we see some of the same names like Mr. Yeaman, Mr. Henry Ram -- are these people who were higher-ups in the cigarette companies?

A.   Yes.  I mean, Addison Yeaman was the head lawyer at Brown & Williamson so he served in that role for quite a number of years; and Mr. Hoyt moved over from Hill & Knowlton when they became CTR and took on that role.

And Henry Ram who was the president of R.J. Reynolds served in that role as well.

Q.   If we look down in the middle, I want to ask a question.  There's a particular law firm and we're not going to mention it.  It's been redacted from the documents.

But I want to be clear as we go through, when you see the law firm, are we always talking about a law firm as opposed to just a random law firm here or there?

A.   Typically, it's a specific law firm.

Q.   Okay.  And the ad hoc special projects, can you describe -- you mentioned special projects earlier.  Can

you tell the jury what role special projects played in the CTR?

A.   Well, it turns out now that we have all the documents there were two type of research that got funded:  There was research that came in, was vetted by the scientists through the scientific advisory board through peer review.  Just like they do it in the government and so on.

And then there were these category of projects that were -- didn't go through that process.  They were both -- they were funded by CTR.  But they were really selected by lawyers.

They would have ad hoc committees, lawyers from the different companies.  They might invite ad hoc members like scientists, research directors for the companies.  They would go out and recruit scientists to basically do research that was of interest to the company specifically.

So it was -- the special projects became a major component of CTR of -- really from 1964 onward to try to counter some of the information coming out about the health risks of smoking.  It didn't go through peer review; it wasn't really selected or vetted by the scientists.  And it was not something that was consistent with what was said in the Articles of

Incorporation of the TIRC, when those articles were sent to the Department of Justice back in 1954.

Q.   And if we look down at the communications committee, would lawyers be involved in the communications committee as well?

A.   Yes.  The communications committee, you know, was they would speak with one voice for their members. Early on, when TIRC existed before the Tobacco Institute, you know, it was Hill & Knowlton pretty much serving in that capacity, putting out the press statements and so on.

After 1958, when the Tobacco Institute was created, it -- it was the communications committee.  It was spun off and that's what became the Tobacco Institute.

And, in fact, you can see exactly the budgets. The budget for TIRC was reduced by the amount of money that went into the Tobacco Institute.  And then from 1950 on, to the end of 1998, you see about ten times as much money going to the Tobacco Institute than you do to the research part of the business.

Q.   And one other question, Dr. Cummings:  We saw the scientific directors.  Are these the scientific directors or a similar role to that that we just saw referenced in the Frank Statement?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And �

A.   Dr. Little was the first one, various team scientists, and he served up until 1971 and then they had others that served in that role; and they were chairing the scientific advisory board and often were used as a spokesperson, as I think we saw, Dr. Sommers I believe mentioned in one of the earlier memos having to do with the warning labels and so...

Q.   That was going to be my question.

In fact, Sheldon Sommers we saw testifying in Congress about there being no link between smoking and cancer.

Is that the same Mr. Sommers we see as the scientific director here on the slide?

A.   Correct.

Q.   When we look back at one of the earlier documents, there was a reference to a white paper that was going to be written by Mr. Tommy Ross.

Remind the jury who Tommy Ross was.

A.   He was a lawyer for American Tobacco Company. MR. SCHULTZ:  And LP0202, Mr. Geraghty, is

the text here, but the sort of backstory to this document and when it came out.

A.   Well, the -- the document came out in April of 1954.  So they announced the creation of TIRC in January of 1954 and the Frank Statement.  No research has been done.  It takes a while to organize an effort; that people write applications, vet those applications, do the research, get the research in front -- you know, present the results.

But in April of 1954 you see them actually issuing a white paper on behalf of the members, and the white paper is designed for, you know, lay public people in the media, sort of opinion leaders; and it's all basically creating doubt about the science linking cigarette smoking and disease.

So it's sort of a one-sided presentation of the evidence that's out there.

Q.   And do they cite -- so one example we have, none of the evidence is conclusive.  Lung cancer is more common than it was one or two decades ago.  Many suggestions as to the cause of this increased air pollution, vehicle exhaust fumes.

Is this a similar sort of story that we will hear from the tobacco industry over time, other causes other than smoking for the disease epidemic?

Does that relate back to Mr. Dakin's memo on the -- or discussion in the forwarding memo? A.   Yes. Q.   And clinical data or question.

What would that relate to when you see a story about clinical data being questioned in a tobacco release?

A.   Well, whether the --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I think the document speaks for itself.

THE COURT:  Would you, please. MR. SCHULTZ:  Sure. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   In this, the first white paper, Dr. Cummings, we see clinical data questions, and this particular one it says that excerpts at the University of Texas School of Medicine have studied statistical associations employed in relating cancer to cigarette smoking.

And would they use that to question clinical findings about the causes of lung cancer?

Q.
	And is that a similar sort of story, if you

will, that will appear time and time again throughout
	
the years?
	
A.

things;
	but there was a lot more than just statistics

behind
	it, and statistics are important.

And they're summarizing public relations and this particular call-out is talking about the distribution of the white paper and how widely distributed the distribution began in April of 1954.

A.   Yes.  They're talking about the success of getting their message out.  So that's what they're tracking.

Q. And are you aware in June 1954 of a Gallup poll that came out asking people how many of you have read or heard something about cigarette smoking and lung cancer?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And was there a high response rate on that poll?

A.   Yeah.  It was over 90 percent that had read or heard something, so it's that sort of general awareness and probably being contributed to things like putting full-page ads in newspapers, like the Frank Statement, and putting out stories, you know, by the white papers and so on.  So that wouldn't be surprising.

Q.   Would the Gallup poll have been about six weeks, seven weeks after what we're seeing described here?

A.   Yes.

Smoke Without Fear. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   There's an indication at the top, "If you're a man or a woman who smokes, relax and enjoy it.  If you've tried to give up smoking a dozen times and failed, quit trying.  So if you're a confirmed smoker, smoke without fear."

Who was the author of this particular article in True magazine?

A.   Yeah, Donald Cooley who was a well-known sort of medical health writer for a variety of different news outlets and magazines.  He was -- as we now know from the internal records from Hill & Knowlton, they had basically fed him the information for his story.

And, in fact, the article, which did appear in True magazine, which at the time was a pretty popular men's magazine, got reprinted as a pamphlet and then sold in newsstands.  So they actually went out and made it available.

This particular story is a pamphlet sold on newsstands.  That was all arranged by the tobacco companies through the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

Q.   And if we look at LP3904, is that the memo you were talking about from Hill & Knowlton where they say

they provided assistance to Mr. Cooley?

A.   Yes.

Q.   If you looked in True magazine in 1954, would there be any indication that tobacco money was paying for Mr. Cooley's article?

A.   No.

Q.   And I understand Mr. Danielson was only a year old in 1954, but was it throughout the life of the conspiracy a common tactic for the industry -- let me ask you this question:  Did the industry message always come from the industry's mouth during the course of this conspiracy or did it often happen like this (indicating)?

A.   It often happened like this.  So there are other examples of ghost-writing articles that appeared in major magazines supplying information to media outlets and often touting other scientists.

As we now know, many of the scientists were paid through special projects; but they would say, well, leading scientists are doubting the link between smoking and disease.  You would hear that over and over again because the industry knew that the public would be skeptical about the industry defending themselves, so they did it through a public relations effort that was orchestrated and paid for by the industry to -- you

know, the general public really had no clue about it.

Q.   And can you tell the jury, Dr. Cummings, who was Edward R. Murrow?

A.   He was the leading newsman, you know, World War II correspondent who in the early 1950s, you know, was famous for the See It Now show and -- it's sort of like the 60 Minutes show today and he would touch on topics that were important.

In 1955, he ran a two-part series in the spring on smoking and health and they had people from the industry, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, as well as scientists who were doing some of the studies claiming that cigarette smoking caused disease.  So, you know, you were getting both sides of the story.

chairman of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

Mr. Murrow, I would like to quote from a statement released at the time the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was formed.

At that time we stated we accept an interest in

people's health as a basic responsibility, paramount

to every other consideration in our business and

that's where we stand today.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   That was Mr. Hartnett?

A.   Right.

Q.   And what was he reading from, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Essentially just restating the Frank Statement, that ad that came out.  So that was reiterated.  Those kinds of statements were reiterated many times.  So this is just two years after the original newspaper ad came out.

Q.   And you mentioned there were people from the public health community.  Can you give us some examples of other people who were on here and now who gave the other side of the story?

A.   Sure.  I mean, there was -- you know, Dr. Wynder appeared on the -- on the show.  There was,

you know, the fellow from Yale who appeared; the statistician for the American Cancer Society; Kyler Hammond who appeared on the show as well and talking about some of their findings.  And they -- they acknowledged early on they were skeptics about the relationship.

I think Dr. Hammond mentioned this and then acknowledged that, you know, based on the findings, when he appeared on the show, he said that there's no doubt that cigarette smoking caused disease, in his mind.

Q.   And who among the guests, Dr. Cummings, was Clarence Cook Little, if you could tell the jury?

A.   Clarence Cook Little is -- as I think we saw was first scientific advisor, chairman of the scientific advisory committee.  He was a well-known geneticist, animal geneticist, former president of the University of Michigan.  And was a very well-known scientist, and he was person appointed as the first chair of the scientific advisory committee of the TIRC.  So he appeared, as you might expect, at this time on the show as well.

MALE SPEAKER:  Dr. Clarence Cook Little, head

of the Jackson Memorial laboratory at Bar Harbor,

Maine.

Q.   Dr. Little, have any cancer-causing agents been identified in cigarettes?

A.   No, none whatever.  But either in cigarettes or in any product of smoking as such.

Q.   Suppose that tremendous amount of research now going on, including that of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, were to reveal that there is a cancer-causing agent in cigarettes. What then?

A.   Well, if it was found by somebody working under the tobacco industry research grant it -- it would be made public immediately.  And just as broadly as we could make it, then (inaudible) would be taken to attempt to remove that substance or substances.  I'd like to say this, however, that I have heard a sort of a point of view, and I'm not blaming this on any one individual, but a point of view that says, "Let's eliminate the agent in tobacco that is harmful."  Well, it seems to me that we can't possibly eliminate an agent that has been identified or the presence of which hasn't yet been proven.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   He was speaking -- was he speaking, Dr. Cummings, on behalf of the industry there?

A.   Yes, he was.

Q.   And had Brown & Williamson at this point identified a carcinogenic substance in the smoke condensate of cigarettes?

A.   Yes, they had Benzo[a]pyrene.

Q.   If we go forward in time --

MR. SCHWARTZ:  And this is LP0127, Mr. Geraghty. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   We see a -- a press release here from Hill & Knowlton indicating "it's unwarranted to conclude from present studies that smoking causes cancer."

Do we see a sort of flood, if you will, of these press releases coming out for a release in newspapers, television, wherever they can get it from, Hill & Knowlton, on the smoking and health question?

A.   Yes.  Often relying on quotations from scientists who were either on the advisory committee or were being funded by TIRC challenging the evidence. Typically, those reports, the press releases, would come out challenging findings that were coming out, because

the research implicating smoking and disease was just exploding in the 1950s.

There was not only more of the human studies, but pathology studies were beginning to come out, more animal studies.  The chemistry was improving because they were beginning to isolate more and more of these harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke.  And so the companies would always have these leading doctors, and then they'd have a quote from somebody who challenged the evidence that cigarette smoking causes cancer.

Q.   And are these sort of typical examples, if you will, as we go through the 1950s, whether "smoking causes lung cancer as an unresolved question.  New findings refute anticigarette charges' doubt about the cigarette charges"?  Is there a constant stream of this sort of messaging from the industry?

A.   Yeah, creating doubt in the smoker's mind the evidence had any credibility.  You were always getting that as the other side.  There was a controversy that was manufactured.

Q.   And did the industry, in fact, when we talk about CTR, for example, and the TIRC hire scientists who had good reputations?

A.   They did.  It became harder for them to find the scientists with the reputations over the years, but

early on, they did -- Dr. Little, as I pointed out, certainly was a well-respected scientist.  So people would pay attention to TIRC and what they had to say.

Q.   I want to ask you -- we've looked at this chart a couple of times, Dr. Cummings.  We saw the dip that you indicated was around '53.  Would that have been the year Lamar Danielson was born?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And we see a dip, and we see it recovering. What does that indicate?

A.   It indicates --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, calls for

speculation, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'm going to overrule the

objection.  Thank you.

A.   It indicates that the companies had been successful in reversing the downward cigarette sales that had brought them together at the Plaza Hotel in 1953, and they had reversed that trend and cigarette sales continued to decline until 1964.

Q.   I want to talk, for a moment, if we could, Dr. Cummings --

described.  And, again, so for the jury's benefit, TIRC has become CTR in 1964?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Do we have documents from within the industry describing how the industry viewed the purpose of the CTR?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is this one such document from Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.  This is 1970, and the relevance of that is Joe Cullman, who is president of Philip Morris, is now the -- he's the head of the executive committee for CTR in 1970.  And he's getting this note written to him by Helmut Wakeham, top scientist at Philip Morris, about the best program for CTR.

Q.   And Dr. Wakeham says to Mr. Cullman, "The stated objective or purpose of CTR is to aid and assist research into tobacco use and health and to make available to the public factual information on the subject."

But he continues:  "It has been stated that CTR is a program to find out the truth about smoking and health.  What is truth to one is false to another.  CTR and the industry have publicly and frequently denied what others find as truth."

And would that refer to the health charge?

Q.   "Let's face it, we are interested in evidence which we believe denies the allegation that cigarette smoking causes disease."

And is the quote at the bottom of that, Dr. Cummings, from Dr. Wakeham as well, "CTR exists for the good of the industry"?

A.   Yes.

Q.   How does that compare to what we saw in the Frank Statement in terms of the public pronouncement of the purpose for TIRC which became CTR?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object.  I think the

statements speak for themselves.

THE COURT:  Overrule the objection.  Thank you.

A.   It's inconsistent with what they said in the Frank Statement that they would put the public's health above all other considerations of their business. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

of the CTR?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And are you familiar with this document from November of 1978 to the CTR filed by R.B. Seligman?

A.   Yes.  Robert Seligman was vice president of Philip Morris, and he's recounting minutes of the meeting of essentially the lawyer group, the ad hoc committee.  They had gotten together to talk about the role of CTR, and they recount the history, why it was created, what its purpose really had been.  And, you know, it's fairly frank discussion at this time inside the industry of what CTR was really all about.

Q.   And if we look at the first page, Dr. Cummings, we see the people who are present include Bill Shin, who is with the law firm; Jim Bowling, senior vice president, corporate affairs at Philip Morris, Inc.; Mr. Seligman, you just described; Tom Osdene, director of research for Philip Morris USA, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And at the bottom, it indicates "at the outset Arnold Henson reminded all participants at the meeting that there should be no written record of what transpired issued for distribution, but Mr. Seligman made this record"; is that right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   -- "of the tobacco industry to long range policy planning in regard to smoking and health." What is an "ad hoc committee"?

A.   Well, it's ad hoc.  So it's not a standing committee, and they were appointed basically to try to -- they were -- what they are discussing in 1978 when this is written is, you know, what should the role of CTR really be.  Should we be rethinking what it was created for originally and recasting it in some way. Then they have an ad hoc committee that's been appointed to provide recommendations back to the executives of the companies.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And if we look down at the next

paragraph, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   It says, "As a means of introduction, Bill Shin described the history particularly in relation to CTRC. CTR began as an organization called Tobacco Industry

Research Counsel."

Is it committee?

A.   Committee, yeah.

Q.   "It was set up as an industry shield in 1954. That was the year statistical accusations relating smoking to diseases were leveled at the industry. Litigation began and the Wynder/Graham reports were issued.  CTR has helped our legal counsel by giving advice and technical information which was needed at court trials.  CTR has supplied spokesman for the industry at congressional hearings.  The money spent in CTR provides a basis for introduction of witnesses."

First of all, is all of that an accurate way to reflect monies that were spent within the CTR based on your review of CTR documents?

A.   Yes.

Q.   CTR scientists were used for court trials as witnesses?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And to testify at Congress, we saw Dr. Sommers, for example?

A.   Correct.

Q.   "Mr. Shin feels that special projects are the best way that monies were spent.  And on these projects CTR has acted as a front?"

He does go on, "However, there are times when CTR has been reluctant to serve in that capacity.  And in rare instances, they have refused to serve in that capacity."

You described special projects briefly before. Can you give a just a brief reiteration of what "special projects" was?

A.   Sure.  These were the projects selected by the lawyers, and they were -- they tended to be in two primary areas:  One, is to come up with people and evidence that would refute the link between cigarette smoking and disease; and then, secondarily, to attack the evidence linking those that had linked cigarette smoking and disease.  And those were the types of studies that the lawyers identified.

And so they went out and recruited scientists. They funded these scientists.  It was those scientists and those studies that they would prop up in their public relations campaign.

And they were not selected independently through a peer-review process by scientists who were truly interested in make- -- you know, looking at the link between smoking and disease.  And over time, what you find with the scientific advisory group is most of the studies they fund are of the basic science nature

and have very little to do with smoking and health.

Q.   If we look over at the next page, Dr. Cummings, it says, "Jim Bowling" --

Is he the vice president for Philip Morris?

A.   Yes, he is.

Q.   -- "add a bit of history."

He talks about TIRC first being established at Hill & Knowlton public relations when the government began to take action against the industry, the Black Nick Committee [phonetic] Hearing.  What was the Black Nick Committee hearing, briefly?

A.   In 1957, they put out a report.  It was a congressional hearing.  It was about marketing of filtered cigarettes at that time because they were all -- were wild claims being made about the effectiveness of filters.  So there was a congressional hearing that looked at, you know, whether any of those claims were true or not, and they found out that the public was being misled by the marketing of filtered cigarettes, because there's no evidence that filters do any good.

Q.   And the Tobacco Institute was split out, which you've described.  The TIRC handled its own function science versus public opinion.  And then the highlighted portion, "Jim, Mr. Bowling, noted that in the past the

industry has been very successful because it has been able to recognize and anticipate trends both of the government and the public.  Thus when government action activity takes place, the industry was prepared to react immediately."

Again, was any of this indicated as the true purpose of CTR as it was represented to the public upon its founding?

A.   No.  It certainly is not what somebody reading the Frank Statement would glean, nor was it what they said in their articles of incorporation, which they said to the Department of Justice.  It says the limit of CTR was to do research on smoking and disease, particularly cancer, and make factual information available to the public.  That was the limits of power.  And certainly what we see is they didn't follow those limits.

Q.   And let me ask you about that.  Let's --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Excuse me, Your Honor, can we approach briefly, please. THE COURT:  You may.

articles of incorporation that were sent to the Department of Justice.  What is going on?

I don't understand what is going on here.  But if he continues to keep throwing that in here, I'm trying not to object and flag it, but what -- there is absolutely, positively no relevance to him continuing now to say for a third time, completely nonresponsive to Mr. Schultz's questions, that this is contrary to their articles of incorporation that were submitted to the Department of Justice.

What does that have to do with the statements they made publicly that are in furtherance of the conspiracy?  It has absolutely nothing to do with that.

And, you know, are -- we keep going back here, and this is the third time he's asked him now, can you summarize what these special projects are? We've had special projects come up three or four times.

He's moved along expeditiously, but we're going back now, and it's just now becoming extremely cumulative.  And the witness is using it as an opportunity to continue to, I think, try to get things in that have no relevance to the case.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Let me start with the second

thing, Judge.  In my experience sometimes even lawyers sitting out in the audience don't even know what CTR is by this point.  It's complicated.

And I'm not trying to be cumulative, but it's important the jury understand who people are when we're talking about them on the DOJ issue.  I can't answer that, other than to say, in every case I've been involved in, they get up and cross-examine and say the Department of Justice approved and Stanley Lawrence, Judge Lawrence, approved the establishment of the TIRC.  I agree, I didn't ask it.  I can only guess that's what he's anticipating having been crossed on it so many times, but I can't speak for Dr. Cummings.

THE COURT:  With regard to the Department of Justice and the articles of incorporation, that was introduced in direct in the O'Hara trial, and then he said exactly what he just said.  So, I mean, that was all part of direct examination.

I don't recall -- I don't think there was an objection at that point in time.

It was nonresponsive to the question asked; so based on that, I'll sustain the objection.

The other issue is the issue of the cumulative nature of the questions.  And he's, you know --

it's -- it's long enough that the importance of what's going to happen is going to come when you make your final argument and you bring all of this together once it's in the record.

And in fairness, I suspect that a desire to say it enough times that the hearers get it has a similar effect of being heard enough times that they stop listening to it.  And we've got some folks that -- one in particular that she has a -- since we've come back from the break she appeared to be asleep at some point.

And so, you know, if we -- if you can move into a different subject and not be cumulative on the questions.  Certainly reinforcement by a -- one time is -- may not be a terrible thing, but this --I -- I acknowledge that there is -- it may be unduly cumulative -- and it's not that you can't cover the same piece of evidence twice.

I mean, cumulative doesn't mean you can't do it twice. It means that unduly cumulative. And that's what we want to avoid.

I know you're trying to cover a lot of ground, and you are covering a lot of ground, and you're doing it expeditiously, and he's not interjecting, you know, at every turn.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I recognize that, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So don't repeat if it's � if it's -- if you do not believe it to be essential. And with regard to the -- to the issue, if you're not bringing it out on direct, then he doesn't need to go there.

If he brings it out on cross, regarding the articles saying one thing and then being a completely different thing, then he's brought that into the mix, that somehow being deceptive to the federal government is being deceptive to the public.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, we were talking about CTR, Mr. Bowling, and the comments at this meeting in 1978 about the organization.

MR. SCHULTZ:  If we can go back, Ryan, to the

PowerPoint. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Look at one other document, LP082.4.  And is this a similar meeting in 1978 at the offices of Lorillard in -- including people from Philip Morris, the law firm, and others within the industry?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And does that include Mr. Yeaman, who's the chairman and president of CTR?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you were just describing to the jury what CTR special projects is, and this document indicates the perfectly sound research -- CTR special projects, the perfectly sound research were frankly designed to support industry arguments.

And I wanted to break that down a little bit and ask you this question:  Did CTR actually do a lot of research or some research, at least, that was good, sound science?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And did CTR even do work that was cited in some Surgeon General's Reports?

A.   Yes.  I think over 600 articles I've been able to locate have been cited out of the 80,000 articles in Surgeon General's Reports, but you would expect that Surgeon General's Reports summarize the literature, you know, no matter what, pro or con in those documents.  So 600 or so funded by CTR, yeah, or TIRC.

Q.   And do you know what fraction or share of CTR work that would represent overall?

A.   Yes, I do.  All of the papers that were published through CTR scientists, because the industry kept track of it or CTR kept track of it, was about 6,000.  So about 600 of those were on smoking and health.  So about 10 percent of the studies that they funded actually dealt with the issue of smoking and health; 90 percent did not.

Q.   And on -- when it comes to TIRC and CTR contributions, I asked you before if Philip Morris had paid its fair share from the beginning.

Is this, based on your calculations, the amount of money between 1954 and 1999 that Philip Morris contributed in terms of its share to the TIRC or CTR?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And is that number $189,506,678?

Q.   I want to shift gears from the CTR and talk for a little bit about the Tobacco Institute.

Will you tell the jury -- we've got a letter here from July 30th, 1957, from Ed Darr?  Who was Ed Darr?

A.   President of R.J. Reynolds.

MR. SCHULTZ:  LP1219, Mr. Geraghty. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And he's writing to Paul Hahn, the president of the American Tobacco Company.  What is he writing to Mr. Hahn about?

A.   He's basically doing a look-back on what had happened over the last, you know, three years since they had met at the Plaza Hotel.  And he said, "You took a bold and courageous step in December 1953 when you called a meeting of manufacturers and other industry groups to discuss ways and means of presenting a united front against the claims that were being made that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, and the formation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was the result."

And he goes on to say there's no -- "Absolutely no question in my mind that if this committee had not been formed, the cigarette industry by now would have

been in a deplorable position.  Instead a very fine job has been done in counteracting verified unjustified unsubstantiated claims of the anticigarette fanatics. In other words, the TIRC has been a successful defensive operation."

Q.   And does Mr. Darr, the head of R.J. Reynolds, go on to propose that they form a new organization?

A.   Yes.  He said, you know, going forward, he said I'm convinced that an organization that manufacturers formed for the narrow and well-defined specific purposes of presenting facts and information helpful to the industry can and should be formed, and that such an organization be entirely separate from the CT -- or from TIRC.  And -- and, in fact, that's what exactly happened several months after this letter was written, the Tobacco Institute was spun off.

Q.   And we've already heard from Mr. Heimann.  Was he involved -- I think you've already told us -- heavily in the TI over time?

A.   Sure.  He served on the executive committee on the Tobacco Institute.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, the finances of the TI, once it was spun off -- indeed, Mr. Heimann indicates it was funded by the major tobacco companies -- was that also on a pro rata basis like the TIRC and the CTR had been?

A.   It was.

Q.   And did Philip Morris pay its fair share to the TI as well at the very beginning?

A.   It did, although the amount of money going to the TI was increased over CTR.  So there was more money going to -- TI started out being a small public relations effort, a couple of people, but by the early 1970s they had a huge staff in their headquarters down in Washington and, you know, it was a major effort from the companies.

Q.   And I don't want to walk through all of this again, but -- actually that's the TIRC CTR structure. Let me ask you this:  The structure in terms of the TI, do we see a lot of the same names involved, a lot of the same lawyers involved running the TI who were involved in CTR?

A.   Yes.  The executive committee was the heads of the cigarette -- major cigarette companies.  As they approved the budget every year, they made the big decisions.

And then the committee of counsel, they sort of, you know, hired the staff.  They basically reviewed everything that was put out.  So they were speaking with a unified voice, and they basically set up the policies internal to the Tobacco Institute and CTR.

So it was largely run by the lawyers on a day-to-day basis, and then you had -- this is the TI executive committee that you're showing.

Q.   So let me ask you:  The executive committee, what was the function -- once we're talking about the Tobacco Institute, PR lobbying arm of the industry, what was the function or the primary function, at least, of the TI executive committee?

A.   Well, you know, the executive committee ran the show.  It was like a board of directors of a company, and they oversaw all aspects of funding, decision-making policies that were brought to them.

They didn't -- you know, necessarily there every day; but, you know, there an executive committee made up of the major executives of their company or their designee.  And they would meet on a regular basis to discuss the role of the TI, whether it was being successful, whether they needed more money to be successful, where they would direct those resources and to what effect.

Q. And is it fair to say that any decision of significance for the Tobacco Institute on any major issue would have to be approved by the TI executive committee?

A.   Yes.

Q.   We see, for example, people who served in this role.

Are these people who served in the role on the

TI executive committee over different time periods?

A.   Yes.

Q.   In other words -- so I'm clear, we're not suggesting this is everybody who was --

A.   No.  Much larger list, actually, because, you know, this went on for 45 -- well, most -- close to 40 years, I guess, for the TI and 45 years for the TIRC.

Q.   But if you look over time, will you always, Dr. Cummings, find that you're talking about presidents and chief executive officers, vice presidents, senior vice presidents of the various companies serving on this executive committee?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Including specifically Mr. Cullman, who we saw as a signer of the Frank Statement?

A.   Correct.  Joe Cullman had a big role in the Tobacco Institute executive committee as well as CTR. And in the early '70s he was the president or the chairman of the TI executive committee; and, in fact, appeared as a spokesperson on behalf of the companies in various -- in that role as chairman of the TI.

Q.   And was participation -- Philip Morris's participation in the Tobacco Institute voluntary?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was that true for all the companies that

participated in it?

A.   They could choose to participate or not. MR. SCHULTZ:  If we look at the document,

Mr. Geraghty, LP5263. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   TI meeting minutes, 1958.  The second meeting of the board of directors.  There's an application for membership by the American Snuff Company; the American Tobacco Company; Liggett & Myers; P. Lorillard; Lariton Brother; Philip Morris, Inc.; R.J. Reynolds; Stephano Brothers, Inc.

And the creation of the executive committee and who was appointed, Dr. Cummings, as members of the executive committee for -- or who was appointed for Philip Morris at this time?

A.   Joe Cullman.

Q.   And is that the same Mr. Cullman we just saw here (indicating)?

A.   Yes.

Q.   If we go forward from 1958 all the way to 1987, and look at minutes of the executive committee, do we still see members from Philip Morris on the executive committee of the Tobacco Institute?

A.   Yeah.  Frank Resnick and Thomas Ahrens were both Philip Morris.

Q.   And if you look at Philip Morris's contributions to the TI for the time period, I guess, that you have figures, from 197 9 to 1999, just that 20-year period, what figure do you arrive at?

A.   278 million.  A little over that.  So they were putting more money into TI.  This is only a partial part of the period when they were funded, because they began in 1958.

Q.   Is this separate and apart from the 189-plus million that was used by Philip Morris to fund CTR?

A.   Yes, it is.

Q.   And in addition to the millions of dollars you already talked about in advertising?

A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And if we look LP2873,

Mr. Geraghty, Page 3. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   This is a document, Dr. Cummings, called Status Report and Update.

And are you familiar with this document?

A.   Yes.  I believe this is mid-'70s, 1976, and it's internal to the TI.  They're really talking about their role working on behalf of their members, the cigarette manufacturers.

Q.   And does this document reflect, Dr. Cummings,

that whether the TI speaks on behalf of the industry as its official spokesperson?

A.   Yes.  This indicates that the TI, when you hear statements put out in press releases or they appear in, you know, in public media, they're speaking on behalf of their members, the cigarette manufacturers; and they typically did that on issues related to smoking and health.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, I have five minutes left.  I am about to change into a sort of new subject.  I'm happy to go into it for five minutes, if you'd like.

THE COURT:  It's a good stopping point.  Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention today.  I know that it's still a little bit wet out there, and we're promised a little bit more wet weather tomorrow.  I need you to be very, very careful as you go home this afternoon.

We're going to let you leave a few minutes early.  Maybe you can get just a slight jump on that traffic at 5:00, but remember the admonitions we gave you earlier.  We'11 be seeing you in the morning.  Good day.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  All the jury has exited.  You may be seated.

Mr. Schultz, what do we need to address?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Nothing from the plaintiff, Your Honor.  I will say we're definitely going to be done with Dr. Cummings tomorrow.  Mr. Geraghty told me he would think three hours of cross on the outside.  Obviously I won't hold him to that.  I know how it goes.

But even with that, the most liberal estimate I still see Dr. Cummings off the stand tomorrow afternoon, and we'll have to find a fact witness to come in and testify because Dr. Burns will arrive to testify on Wednesday morning.  He arrives tomorrow to -- tomorrow evening to testify Wednesday morning.

THE COURT:  Okay.

Mr. Geraghty.

MR. GERAGHTY:  That seems reasonable.  I have two items I want to address for the Court, but those probably are more appropriately done outside the presence of the witness.

THE COURT:  Sure.  Okay.

THE WITNESS:  Can I be excused?

THE COURT:  For the evening.

THE COURT:  See you in the morning.  We will get started at 8:30.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah.

THE WITNESS:  Pretty good at this.

THE COURT:  Mr. Geraghty.

MR. GERAGHTY:  One -- one is a logistical issue and a request.  I have -- not all the slides remaining.  I think I'm entitled to have at this point all the slides that were going to be shown for Dr. Cummings at this point.

I have still a box and a half of stuff that hasn't been gone through, but I think I should have the slides.  I would make that request.  I think Mr. Schultz should give me whatever remaining slides he intends to use with Dr. Cummings.  That's No. 1.

No. 2, I stood up at one point and said I have a motion to make, Your Honor, and I didn't elaborate.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'll be very brief, Your Honor.

I think Your Honor sustained the objection, but before you sustained the objection, Dr. Cummings did say that we opposed efforts to strengthen the

warning labels.  I would move for a mistrial on that because it's essentially inviting the jury to punish us because we have invoked our First Amendment rights.  I just want to make sure that's clear for the record.

The last issue I have is really -- I guess maybe we can deal with this for purposes of tomorrow, but there was a document that was shown during opening statement that we approached and made reference to Negro smokers.  And Your Honor asked that it be redacted.  It was redacted during the opening.

That document was flashed on the screen without redaction during the examination.  I didn't notice it.  Mr. Schultz noticed it before I even did.  He kind of walked in front of it.  I appreciate that he did that.

There are other documents within the documents that have been admitted into evidence that make references to things like -- and you saw a few --litigation and lawsuits and witnesses testifying in lawsuits.

Your Honor may say that Judge Bell has already ruled on that and -- and that comes in because the document was admitted.  I think it's a 403 issue

clearly.  Clearly because there has been litigation against this industry going back to the 1950s.  No question about it.

And there are references in some of the documents to that.  And I -- I don't see -- that's not part of the conspiracy.  I don't think it's necessary, and I think it only runs the risk of the jury beginning to think that's important.

And there's references to lawyers in the documents, and I'm not saying that every reference to a lawyer needs to be taken out.  But to the extent that we have documents that come up tomorrow that make references to lawsuits and litigation and things of that nature, I would just ask that those things be redacted.

MR. SCHULTZ:  The motion for mistrial, Judge, I think we made our point eventually, which was the point I was getting to when the initial objection and motion was made, which was the industry came in and used misleading science to oppose the warnings through the guise of Dr. Sheldon Sommers and others.

So the evidence that we were trying to get to and that we got to on the opposition to the warnings shows that they misled to the extent we talked about congressional testimony at all.

They also publicly opposed the warnings.  So simply saying that the industry opposed the warnings doesn't mean -- did they only oppose the warnings in Congress?  They did that.  We gave an example of them misleading Congress or making misrepresentations about the science to Congress.

But we also saw public statements, particularly by RJR.  The Tobacco Institute put out a press release on it, and we saw that press release.

So opposition to the warnings does not just mean going in front of Congress.  In fact, the press release itself is what references the congressional appearance -- they come in and say that the warnings are the end-all be-all.  A lot of jurors we heard in jury selection believe that.

We're entitled to put the warnings in perspective as long as we don't cross that line into preemption.  And we have toed that line, at least we certainly attempted to.  We have certainly not heard any objections on those grounds.

The issue about the Negro reference in the document.  First of all, Judge, I mean, I don't have any problem taking that -- those references out. They're not necessary to anything, and I understand how they can offend.  It's simply a matter of this

PowerPoint was done before the opening statement.

In terms of the order of the slides, that cut was in there.  And when we took it out of the opening, we didn't go back and change it in there. We should have, honestly, because we changed it in the opening.

As soon as I saw the word I stopped reading and did quote -- I didn't even get to make the point I wanted to make.  I walked in front of it and flipped to the next slide and moved on because I didn't want there to be any argument we were putting something in front of the jury intentionally, which, obviously, I would not have done.

References to -- and if there are other such references, Your Honor, that's why we exchange exhibits a month or so before trial.  We've never had some rule that that comes out of these documents.  And if Philip Morris has an objection, I'm fine going in and saying, look, you objected; I'll take it out.  I can't go up the night before I put somebody on the stand and find every reference to the word X, Y, or Z that I think Philip Morris might maybe get upset about.

So I don't know about redacting that stuff out. Obviously, the word "Negro" we already talked about.

I don't know that it shows up in any of the other documents.

Litigation, Your Honor, the first document I've put up on the conspiracy is the 1972 document from Mr. Panzer to Mr. Kornegay, which says that's one of the three reasons for the conspiracy.  And the lawyers rein the conspiracy, Judge.  I know -- you know, that's just a fact, and that's what the document showed.  That's what the structure of the -- the conspiracy shows, and that it is inescapable.

So if we redacted all references to lawyers, we wouldn't have some of the statements that we had. For example, today where a lawyer is saying the CTR is a front and a shield for the industry; but the --the jury certainly needs to hear that.

We've redacted out Shook Hardy, which plaintiffs oppose.  We lost that motion.  We've taken those references out.  There was no request at that time, and there shouldn't be in the middle of a direct examination a new request to take out now all references to litigation and lawyers.

That was part of the trifecta of concerns that the industry had.  It's part of a lot of the conspiracy documents because it's a lot of what they

were worried about; and it would be not only impractical but certainly unnecessary for us to try and redact every reference to litigation or lawyers out of the conspiracy because a whole lot of conspiracy was posed.

THE COURT:  With regard to the Noerr-Pennington issue, in O'Hara I had the instruction No. 18 that talked about the manufacturers' appearances before Congress and various regulatory agencies.  And I said that under the law, the manufacturer has the right to petition, provide information and express its views to the government on the issue of policy and legislation concerning smoking and health.

These and similar communications with the government, advocacy efforts and government submissions are protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution as well as Florida law.

However, false, misleading, or deceitful statements and representations are not protected under the First Amendment.

Certainly if there is a request for a curative instruction for the jury to understand that, there is no -- it's not appropriate to punish for exercising one's right to petition the government.

I don't have a problem with giving that instruction if requested.

When it did come up, did they oppose the government's imposition of these warnings?  Again, that flat statement standing alone would, I think, run afoul of this.  I think giving of a -- of a curative instruction like this would -- should cure it, and it would not be a reason for mistrial.

But it -- in the context -- and certainly, I feel more -- even more so in the context of that which followed, the specific evidence regarding the -- this witness's testimony that there were misrepresentations being made during the appearance before the government.  Certainly, if I'm not mistaken -- and I -- I wasn't doing all of the pretrial hearings.  I think that issue was likely covered by Judge Bell for this -- you not to get into that area in which it was -- the petitioning of the government and not trying to insinuate fault for taking a position before a government agency.

I don't recall off the top of my head whether there is such an order of Judge Bell or not. However, in context of all that came out, I certainly -- I did rule that was objectionable as it came but that I was not asked to give a curative

instruction.  But I am willing to give one, but in the context of all that followed, I think that no more is required than to give a curative instruction to put that appropriately in context.  And also the same instruction I gave in O'Hara, I can give here in the final instructions.

With regard to the lawyers and litigation, I tend to agree that the evidence is what it is. There were lawyers involved, and there was litigation which was the goal and purpose of some of the activities; and, you know, some of the -- the VPs and -- and senior officials who were participating in the organizations were, you know, general counsel.  I mean, they -- you know, they had vice president so-and-so general counsel, of -- of the defendant was serving on this TI executive committee.

So -- and there were lawyers involved, lawyers who were participating in the alleged con- --conspiracy.  And so I don't think I can sanitize it to the point that we don't mention lawyers.  I think I -- we certainly must continually be cautious that there is not evidence that would insinuate that the lawyers being retained to defend the defendant against plaintiff's claims in this case are in some

way painted with that brush, that they go out and hire lawyers to make misrepresentations, and that's what they've done in this case, and -- and all of these sorts of stuff.  And we need to -- you know, we need to steer a very broad berth around that.

And, you know, to the extent that -- yeah, I don't know what other -- I don't know what else you need to talk about in terms of litigation.  I mean, it's been presented, but the goal and purpose of some of these things was so that they would have scientists who would be available in litigation, and that's okay.  That's there.  You know, and, again, what more do we need now to say?

So from that standpoint, I don't know how much more pounding on that without crossing the line getting us over into that area, which the jury may inappropriately consider that any time a tobacco company hires a lawyer, they somehow must be trying to conceal something.

So that -- that would be inappropriate.  It would not be permissible.  So -- but we're not there yet, and I need -- with that in mind, I think you can guide the remainder of your direct examination so that you don't make that any sort of a focal point.

MR. SCHULTZ:  The litigation, yes.  I mean, we will have more documents tomorrow, Your Honor, on the lawyers running the science --

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. SCHULTZ:  -- over time because we have to show --

THE COURT:  I understand.

MR. SCHULTZ:  � 50 years.

THE COURT:  But it's, again, that they hire lawyers -- that they hired unscrupulous lawyers to represent them in litigation is really got to be something you avoid.  That in any manner would implicate that somehow the law firm that's -- that is representing the defendant in this case was engaged with any such instructions or has any such motive or acts in any such way.  Okay?

With regard to the documents request he talked about, you didn't respond to that.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Oh, I'm sorry, Judge.  Yeah, I mean, you know, we have an agreement in the pretrial stip that said -- the reason I didn't give them all of them is I had no -- it's in my conspiracy, and they are a roadmap to my direct examination.  It gives them a tactical advantage.

That said, it's the way I've chosen to do that.

We've agreed we would do it in the morning or on a break, 15 minutes ahead for opening and closing, so that you don't have all night to study them and prepare a cross.  But I'd rather give them to him and give him a tactical advantage than us being here arguing at 9:00 tomorrow morning about the slides or documents.  So although I've given them ahead of time and might create more argument, I don't know, Judge.  The short version is I'm going to give them all to him, and we'll see what happens.

THE COURT:  I probably need to be here at 8:00 to start -- they are -- to begin the arguments on what they're going to do when they receive the documents.

MR. SCHULTZ:  They've received all the documents over a year ago, Judge, and they received a list of every document I'm using Friday night, I believe -- yes, Friday evening.  There isn't going to be any surprised documents in the slides, I can assure you of that.

THE COURT:  Do I need to show up at 8:00 in the morning?

single slide that we're possibly going to show the witness before they go on.  When I start to cross Dr. Cummings, I'm going to give him a notebook of every single document I might conceivably cross-examine him with.  That's the way we're going to do it, I just think in fairness.

THE COURT:  I think that's what he just said. He's going to do that.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm handing them over.  I'm not going to give you a notebook of every document that I'm using to cross Dr. Dorce, so just so we're clear about that.  That is a pretrial stip as well.

THE COURT:  Okay.  You gave him the one thing he asked for.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's right.

THE COURT:  So he can't be too disappointed.

The last thing is inappropriate references that have been ruled upon are voluntarily redacted by agreement, which haven't been corrected on the slides.  With both of you looking at the slides tonight, if any such thing exists, I think that's going to solve the problem.

screen.  I didn't -- I didn't -- I didn't realize it was up there until it was up there.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Me either.

THE COURT:  Okay.  With regard to our jury, the juror in the back row with the multicolored hair, was doing a great job of appearing to listen with her eyes closed for a substantial portion of time.

None of you brought it to my attention, but I'm sure that you-all were aware of it.  And that after we took a break, she came back, and she picked up her notepad and everything and began to, you know, act as if she was taking notes and paying attention. But there was a -- a good several minutes that, you know, she had -- she had her eyes closed and her head tilted to the side.  I actually have known judges who tell me that's how they listen to cases and --

(Laughter.)

THE COURT:  And --

MR. SCHULTZ:  I know one in particular.

I just do something like that (indicating), and generally it gives the lawyers a way to -- and sometimes the jury, but we'll see if I need to do that tomorrow.  I'm sure the court reporter doesn't appreciate me doing that with those earphones in.

But is there anything else we need to address tonight?

We wearing a bowtie today?  Okay.

And, secondly, has anything happened to you overnight that would affect your ability to continue to serve as a fair and impartial juror?  Anyone? Anything?

Thank you so much.

Okay.  We're picking back up.  This is the direct examination of this witness and so Mr. Schultz will continue his examination.  When he concludes this direct examination, of course, Mr. Geraghty will have an opportunity to ask questions.  Thank you.

Q.   Good morning, Dr. Cummings.  Welcome back.

A.   Good morning.

Q.   We'll pick right up.  Yesterday, when we broke, we were talking about and you were explaining to the jury that the Tobacco Institute was the official spokesperson of the industry?

A.   Correct.

Q.   I want to move forward to 1958.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And, Ryan, if you could pull up

LP0250. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Are you familiar with this report on visit to USA and Canada back in April and May of 1958, Dr. Cummings?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can you pull up the live

document, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Can you give the jury a little background on the nature and purpose of this trip and who came over?

A.   Sure.  The trip is a report from three scientists who worked for British American Tobacco or their affiliated companies.  So they have one person who worked for a company in South Africa, another in Canada, and then one other person from their parent company in

And they came to the United States, and they met with over 40 people, the heads of the research departments of Philip Morris and American Tobacco and other cigarette companies.  They met with members of the TIRC, Scientific Advisory Board.  They met with the technical research committee of the TIRC, which was also made up of the scientists, the head scientists from the cigarette companies.  They met with some academic researchers, people at the National Cancer Institute.

And, basically, the question that they were asking themselves is, you know, what is the situation on the conclusion about whether cigarette smoking caused cancer, lung cancer in particular, as of 1958?

And they drew a conclusion based on that, and then -- and then further discussion goes on as to the nature of the evidence and the magnitude of the effect.

Q.   And if we take a look at Page 2 of the document.

You mentioned they met with a lot of folks over here.  Did they meet with people from the American Tobacco Company? A.   Yes.

Q.   And was Mr. Hanmer in the research department at American Tobacco?

A.   Yes, he was.

Q.   Folks at the medical college of Richmond in Virginia, in Richmond, Virginia, Drs. Larson and Hague?

A.   Yes.  You know, Dr. Hague had been a longtime contractor of American Tobacco back -- dating into the '30s, and Dr. Larson came on board in the 1940s, and they put out information on the health risks of smoking. So they met with them at the Virginia -- in the medical college of Virginia.

Q.   And do we see that these scientists from British American Tobacco also met with folks from Philip Morris, including Dr. Seligman, whose name we heard before?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And people from the TIRC are mentioned?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Including Hill & Knowlton?

A.   Right.  They met with -- they had several meetings with TR- -- TIRC-related folks.

This is Mr. Hoyt, who was with Hill & Knowlton. He moved over, I think I mentioned, to TIRC permanently from Hill & Knowlton.

Carl Thompson was one of their head PR persons. He was with Hill & Knowlton.

So this was sort of meeting with the public

relations people.

And then later met with Dr. Little and Dr. Hockett, who were both scientists.  Dr. Little, the chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board, and then members of the Scientific Advisory Board.

And also the technical -- I think there's a meeting in May where they met with the TIRC technical research committee, which was the -- essentially the research directors for the major cigarette companies.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And can we go to the next page, please, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   You mentioned the purpose of the trip, Dr. Cummings.  They indicate:  "From our contacts in USA and Canada, we sought information on the following, including the extent to which it is accepted that cigarette smoke causes lung cancer."

Do we have their conclusion based on these meetings with all these folks? A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  If we look down below, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

events which leads finally to lung cancer and which involves smoking as an indispensable link."

The one person who did not agree with this, they indicate, was an H.S.N. Greene.  Who was he?  Was he with Philip Morris?  Let me ask you that.

A.   No.  He was a pathologist at Yale University. And, actually, there are other documents that talk about Harry Greene and his studies that he had done, and they basically concluded his studies were probably unsound and misleading in terms of their conclusions.

But, essentially, by 1958, everybody in the industry had accepted the fact that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.  And -- and, actually, the public health community had pretty much come to that conclusion in 1957.  Leroy Burney, the Surgeon General of the United States, had said that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer even though the official report didn't come out till '64.

Q.   And if we look, Dr. Cummings, over at Page 6 of the document, you indicated a few moments ago they met the Scientific Advisory Board of the TIRC?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And they state:  "The SAB of TIRC is supporting, almost without exception, projects which are not related directly to smoking and lung cancer."

How does that compare with the charter of the SAB or, more specifically, with the announced purpose of the SAB in the Frank Statement?

A.   It's completely inconsistent with what they said they were going to do.

Q.   And does that go back to the 6,000 research articles or studies that you talked about yesterday?

A.   Right.  C- -- all the CTR documents came to me. So I've seen all the papers, the 6,000 papers that were published, all the grants that they funded.  Only about 600 out of the 6,000 of the papers really had anything to do with smoking and health, and that's re- -- also reflected in the research grants.

I mean, they were good science, but, you know, they weren't focused on trying to determine whether cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.

Q.   There's also an indication at the beginning of the paragraph Liggett & Myers stayed out of TIRC.  I think you told the jury that yesterday.  They were not at the Plaza Hotel?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And it says:  "Originally because they doubted the sincerity of TIRC motives and believed that the organization was too unwieldy to work efficiently."

And did Liggett & Myers nevertheless support

the conspiracy that we're talking about independently?

A.   Yes.  I mean, they joined as a member of the Tobacco Institute, which, again, put out the public statements, the denials, and so on.  And then later they began to fund the special projects.

So when those special projects were funded, beginning after 1964, Liggett & Myers was providing resources to CTR.  So they were providing big financial support to CTR.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we go back, please, Ryan, to

the PowerPoint. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   If we move ahead three years, Dr. Cummings, we see a document from Philip Morris, a presentation to the R&D committee by Dr. Wakeham in November of 1961. Are you familiar with this document?

A.   I am.

Q.   And Dr. Wakeham in this presentation puts together a partial list of compounds in cigarette smoke, also identified as carcinogens.

Is there any question, by this point in time, that the highest levels at R&D in Philip Morris were aware of the presence of carcinogens in their cigarettes?

A.   There's no doubt that they were aware this --

that the carcinogens were found.  They didn't find all these carcinogens.  The list comes from published literature as well as their own R&D.

And they're scoring the carcinogens in terms of potency.  So the little plus signs -- the more plus signs, the more potent; that is, the more likely the chemical at a low dose will cause disease.  Cancer.

Q.   And this is LP2241.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we go to Page 21 of the

document. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Wakeham, in his presentation, says: "Reduction of carcinogens in smoke to achieve this objective will require a major research effort because carcinogens are found in practically every class of compounds in smoke.  This fact prohibits complete solution of the problem by eliminating one or two classes of compounds.  The best we can hope for is to reduce a particularly bad class, i.e., the polynuclear hydrocarbons or phenols.  Present technology does not permit selective filtration of particulate smoke." How does this conclusion in Dr. Wakeham's presentation to the R&D committee back in 1961 relate to what the industry, including Philip Morris, was telling the public about the dangers of smoking?

A.   Well, they were telling the public that it hadn't been proven that smoking caused disease, even though we know in 1958 that their own internal scientists believed it.

We know that they were telling the public that, if there were anything bad found in cigarettes, they could remove it.  And here they're acknowledging the fact there are a lot of bad things.

It's not the -- just the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons which, you know, you see in some of the research in the '50s, but now they're finding many additional classes of harmful chemicals in cigarettes as the technology is improved to identify and isolate those chemicals.  And they can't remove it with a filter.

So their technology really -- they had -- had found the carcinogens. They knew they were there, and they knew they couldn't fix the problem, but they told the public that they didn't believe that their products were injurious to health. That if there were anything bad, they were looking for it, and if they ever found anything, they would remove it.

And that was reassuring to anybody who was a cigarette smoker or thinking of becoming a cigarette smoker, because there was nothing to worry about.

PowerPoint, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   I want to look -- as we move forward, Dr. Cummings, we see that, after the -- the drop in the meeting at the Plaza Hotel, there was a rise in smoking until we get to this point. Is this 1964?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And then we see a drop in smoking in 1964.

What happened in 1964 that would -- you could attribute that drop to?

A.   Well, the Surgeon General's Report came out in January, January 11th of 1964, and was big news.  Got a lot of coverage on all the major TV and networks and newspapers and so on.

And there was a drop in cigarette sales for about two months, when the month of January and February sales had declined, but then had rebounded again in March.

So there was a slight drop.  People were trying to refrain from smoking.  And most ended up going back to smoking again.

Q.   Did the industry know, members of the industry, that the Surgeon General's Committee was meeting to prepare this report?

A.   Sure.  It was, you know, certainly public knowledge.  Actually, the report came about because John F. Kennedy was asked about -- President Kennedy was asked about a report out of Great Britain in 1962 at one of his press events.  And that report out of Great Britain had concluded that smoking caused cancer, much like the Surgeon General's Report would later say.

And President Kennedy basically said, "I don't know anything about the report, but I'll have somebody look into it."

Two weeks later they announce -- Luther Terry, who was the Surgeon General, announced the formation of the committee, that would be impartial, to look at the evidence.  And that began in 1962, in -- in the spring, actually, in June, and then they began to deliberate and gather evidence.

And there were ten scientists who were the advisory committee to the Surgeon General, that reviewed the evidence and then published it as the report which came out in January.

It was actually supposed to come out in November of that year, but because President Kennedy was assassinated, they delayed the issuing of the report until January.

Q.   And was the industry, specifically Brown &

Williamson, British American Tobacco, at the same time the Surgeon General's Committee was meeting, doing its own research into nicotine and the addictive properties of nicotine?

A.   Yes.  They had extensive research going on internally in their own companies.  They also had contract research.  Brown & Williamson hired a company called Battelle, and they had done extensive studies beginning in the late '50s that were referred to as "Project Hippo" -- you know, hippocampus and the brain. They were looking at the addictive nature of nicotine and the effects of nicotine, and those reports were circulated within the tobacco companies.

Q.   And does this telegram, this cable that we see from July of 1963, relate to the research they were doing?

A.   It does.  It relates to the Battelle report. That's in reference to Project Hippo.  And the context of this is, each of the cigarette companies were asked by the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee to turn over --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor --

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  -- this is nonresponsive to the

question, and I object to that.  The question was:

Does this telegram relate to the research?

THE COURT:  I'm overruling the objection.

Thank you.

A.   The context was that each of the companies had been asked to turn over any relevant health research for the advisory committee, and so the companies were, in fact, in the spring of 1963, you know, preparing and deciding what they would send to the advisory committee. And this is a reference to the Battelle reports, and it indicates Finch, who was the president of Brown & Williamson.  Brown & Williamson is owned by British American Tobacco, so they are the U.S. affiliate of British American Tobacco.

So President Finch of British American -- or of Brown & Williamson agrees, "Submission Battelle and Griffith developments to Surgeon General are undesirable."

Q.   And the information that they did not disclose to the Surgeon General, is that the nicotine research at Battelle you were just describing?

A.   Yes.

1963, "Strictly Private and Confidential Implication of Battelle Hippo 1 and 2 in the Griffith Filter."

Does this refer in its title to the research you were just telling the jury about?

A.   Yes.  And this is just a couple of weeks later. The telegram was July 3rd, and this is, you know, two weeks later.  And this a memo written by Addison Yeaman, who's chief general counsel of Brown & Williamson.  He's also the president of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

Q.   Okay.  And if we look over at Page 4, does Mr. Yeaman describe conclusions from the Battelle research?

A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Let me look at the bottom first,

Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Mr. Yeaman says, "Moreover, nicotine is addictive.  We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug effective in the release of stress mechanisms.  But cigarettes, we will assume the Surgeon General's Committee to say, despite the beneficent effect of nicotine, has certain unattractive side effects that cause or predispose to lung cancer. They contribute to certain part of cardiovascular

disorders.  They may well be truly causative in emphysema/' et cetera, et cetera.

Is this the conclusion from Battelle, among others perhaps, that it was from the Surgeon General's Committee?

A.   Yes.

Q.   What did the Surgeon General's Committee say in 1964 about addiction in that report?

A.   Well, they had a section on why people smoke; and they concluded, based on the criteria they used at that time, that cigarette smoking would be classified as a habit not as an addiction.

Q.   And if we look back at the top, Battelle says, "The reasons for the pleasure of smoking must be found partly in the relief of anxiety that cigarette smoking brings so constantly, and in such a very short time."

Is that a true statement based on your own research and study?

A. Yes, not only my research and study, but also reflected in the companies. They knew that one of the effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction is it helps people cope with stress.

Q.   Is it fair to say the Battelle report led the industry to conclude this is a reason for people smoking and also that nicotine is addictive?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object.

And can we approach about this briefly?

THE COURT:  You may.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MR. GERAGHTY:  My objection, Your Honor, is that this has happened now two or three times, but there have been references to the industry.  There is absolutely no evidence that the Addison Yeaman memo that they showed on the screen was ever transmitted to Philip Morris or otherwise communicated to Philip Morris.

And I object to the form of these questions where they're not very precisely talking about who is involved. That document was written by a lawyer at Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation. He did not work for Philip Morris, and there's, again, no evidence that it was transmitted to Philip Morris. So that's the basis for my objection, and I wanted Your Honor to know what the form objection was.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think it's fair to say "the industry" when we're talking about Brown & Williamson.  They imply contemporaneous knowledge, and that's a fair point.  I would add, this is an act in furtherance of a conspiracy.  It's --

THE COURT:  I understand, but then that's the thing you argue later.  The thing you bring out now is Battelle and Williamson is doing this thing, right?

MR. GERAGHTY:  And the wind is actually made. I mean, I couldn't stop him because it was in the middle of a very long rambling answer, but the witness said at one point that these documents, the Battelle research, was shared within the industry. The only evidence of who it was shared with was: British American Tobacco Company was a company which was never a defendant in the Engle case and is not listed as one of the conspirators, according to the Engle case.

So when he says "was shared within the industry," that's a very misleading statement in the context of this case, where we're talking only about specific companies that were identified in the Engle case as being part of the agreement to conceal.  So that's why I wanted to make that objection, because I think otherwise it can be very misleading to the jury.

MR. SCHULTZ:  First of all, we know it was shared with R.J. Reynolds.  There's a letter from Addison Yeaman submitting the report to Henry Ram,

who was involved in CTR, TI, and was counsel for RJR, so that's not accurate.  In his cross-examination, Judge --

THE COURT:  I understand, but the point that brought us up here is the point that you're going to be a little bit more precise in your questions, and you will require a little bit more precision in the responses that there isn't this -- a broad brush when a broad brush is not appropriate.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Sure.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And that's my problem with the very long expansive answers that are nonresponsive because these things get thrown in.  I mean, many of the questions are not necessarily objectionable on their face, but it's what's said.  You know, the expansive answer that's nonresponsive is where that problem starts to crop up.

THE COURT:  Right.  But you understand the ruling of the Court, and I think you can insist upon clarification or precision in the response.

But, again, one of the ways I can keep it from being a long narrative answer is to let Mr. Schultz go back to leading around -- leading him around by the nose.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'd rather --

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't think I've objected to a leading question but maybe once in this whole --

THE COURT:  Maybe twice.  Okay.  Thanks, guys. (The following proceedings were held within the hearing of the jury.) BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, we were talking about the conclusion from Mr. Yeaman, a lawyer for Brown & Williamson, based on the Battelle research on pleasure and addiction.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I want to look back at Page, I think, 2, Ryan, of the memo while we're looking at it. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Does Mr. Yeaman also make a comment about the TIRC and the work that it's doing? A.   Yes.

Q.   "The TIRC cannot" -- in his opinion -- "provide a vehicle for such research.  It was conceived as a public relations gesture, and however undefiled the Scientific Advisory Board and its grants may be, it has functioned as a public relations operation."

Again, I would ask the same question I asked before, Dr. Cummings.  Would that be consistent or

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, it's cumulative at

this point.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I would overrule the

objection.  Thank you.

A.   Inconsistent.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Now if we go back, Ryan, to the

PowerPoint. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   You told the jury, Dr. Cummings, that the Surgeon General's Report made big news, and we see that it made the front page news in Pensacola.

First question:  How old would Lamar Danielson have been in 1964?

A.   10 or 11.

Q.   Now, when this report came out in January of 1964, did the industry stand up and say "we agree with the Surgeon General and we need to get to the bottom of this"?

A.   No, just the opposite.

Q.   And you indicated a lot of people had quit smoking shortly after the Surgeon General's Report came out.

Was there a rebound in smoking shortly after that?

A.   Yes.  Cigarette sales rebounded, as I said, in March and then continued to climb for the rest of the year.  So overall, '64 looked like a little dip compared to '63.  But then by '65, '66 actually was the highest per capita sales that they had.

Q.   Is this, Dr. Cummings, LP4999, the same FTC report we saw yesterday from 1967?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And does this explain that phenomena you were just describing?

A.   Yes, it does.

Q.   That cigarette sales continued to increase each year, except for '64, when they declined by 10.7 billion or about 2 percent, and of that decline from '63 to '64, 10 billion occurred in the months of January and February, and the March sales figures were generally higher in 1964 than 1963.

Is that what you were just describing to the jury?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, when this report came out, did the industry heads get together and have a meeting about it?

A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we pull up, please, LP2595,

Ryan.

Q.   A memorandum of January 13th, 1964.  How soon after the report would this be, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Two days.  Report came out on Saturday; their meeting Monday.

Q.   And it's a report to Mr. Toms.  Who was Mr. Toms?

A.   He was an attorney, I believe, with Liggett & Myers.

Q.   And do you know who wrote this document?

The report indicates a meeting of the Tobacco Institute Executive Committee was held on Sunday, January 12th, 1964, and was attended by the executive committee and one or more counsel for each of the member companies, and then it follows a discussion of those proceedings.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   "Mr. Gray said his initial analysis of the report of the advisory committee of the Surgeon General on smoking and health indicated that it cuts off a number of the answers which the industry has used to advantage on the question."

First of all, who is Mr. Gray?

A.   He was Bowman Gray from R.J. Reynolds, was one of their chief executives.  I believe he was the president of Reynolds at the time, so it would make sense since this is the executive committee at the TI meeting.

Q.   And it indicates that he says, "It is considered to be of prime importance that the industry maintain a united front, and that if one or more companies were to conduct themselves as a matter of self interest, particularly in advertising, obvious vulnerability would be the result."

Did the industry, in fact, maintain the united front in response to the Surgeon General's Report?

A.   Yes.  In fact, George Weissman to Joe Cullman talked how successful -- in his memo to Joe Cullman, how successful they had been with the united front, and then moving forward, the public relations campaign had to give smokers a psychological crutch and self-rationale

to keep smoking.

Q.   And Mr. Gray said he "favored referring press media to the statement made on Saturday by George Allen."

Who was George Allen?

A.   He was the -- at the time president of the Tobacco Institute, so...

MR. SCHULTZ:  And if we can look over at

Page 3, please, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   The same Mr. Allen says, "There are already four bills introduced in Congress concerning smoking, and that Senator Neuberger would introduce two additional bills on Monday.  These are concerned with labeling, advertising, tar, and nicotine content education, et cetera.  And it was expected that early hearings might ensue."

Is there an expression -- an expression of concern throughout this meeting, Dr. Cummings, about potential legislative restrictions or regulatory restrictions put on the industry?

Q.   "FPH reported the informal conclusions arrived at by litigating counsel in light of the report, including that their definition of cause, the committee's definition of cause, is explicit.  No longer can counsel hope to put as much stock in the semantics of causative factors."

He also noted that, "As long as smoking is a contributory cause, this suffices is on proof of causation."

Is this a discussion -- we talked about legislative or regulatory concerns -- a discussion also of concern about how the report will affect their ability to litigate?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Down at the bottom do we see a concern, Dr. Cummings, that, "The report accepts the increase in the incidence of lung cancer as a true one.  It puts little stock in our argument that diagnostic improvements would indicate a large part of the increase

is only apparent."

What are they referring to there when they --he says "our argument"?

A.   The industry's public statements to the public that the increasing occurrence of lung cancer was due to a detection bias; you were just finding more lung cancers because you're able to detect them more readily. And there really wasn't a true increase in the number of cases.  That was one of the arguments that the industry put forward to allay people's fear that smoking caused lung cancer.

Q.   And so we see the concern about legislation and the other concerns that you've talked about with the jury.

Is there any concern expressed anywhere in the meeting minutes of this meeting of the tobacco industry executive committee, Tobacco Institute executive committee of the health implications of the Surgeon General's Report?

A.   No.

A.   Yes.

Q.   And can you tell the jury who we will be hearing from?

A.   This is Howard Cullman.  He was an executive for Philip Morris on their board, actually, board of directors.  Long-term member of the Philip Morris company and he was also the president of the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association; and he was one of the spokespersons that appeared when all the major networks did a story as soon as the Surgeon General's Report came out.  So they had people from both sides commenting on the report.

MALE SPEAKER:  (Inaudible) toxic about tobacco in which are removable by filter?

MALE SPEAKER:  Well, obviously filter takes out certain tar and nicotine.  I don't think the industry admits there are any bad elements.  If there are bad elements, through our laboratories, through the Surgeon General, through the AMA, through acts of God, luck, we hope we may find them; and if they are found, they may be removed.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   How long is this, Dr. Cummings, after the presentation from Dr. Wakeham that we saw where he said there's carcinogens in every class of compound and they can't take them out?

A.   This is 1964 and Dr. Wakeham's presentation to the R&D committee at Philip Morris was November 1961, so about three years later.

Q.   And did the British American Tobacco Company send scientists back over to meet with the industry again in the wake of the Surgeon General's Report?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   And is this the -- the report similar to what we saw before of their meeting?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it's LP0204.

We see they met with Mr. Joe Cullman, president of Philip Morris; Mr. George Weissman, whose name we've heard, president of Philip Morris International; Mr. Jim Bowling, vice president; Dr. Wakeham, and some other folks from Philip Morris.

Did they also meet with the other companies,

including the Tobacco Institute, Hill & Knowlton?

A.   Yes.  This is high-level meetings of primarily the cigarette companies that they meet with at this particular time.

Q.   And if we look over among other things that they discussed, did they meet with the committee of lawyers?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And including Paul Smith from Philip Morris?

A.   Correct.  He's commenting here that the committee of lawyers is extremely powerful.  It determines the high policy of the industry on all smoking and health matters, research and public relation matters, for example, as well as legal matters; and it reports directly to the presidents.

It's indicating that this lawyer committee or committee of counsel really sort of runs the show.

Q.   And does this include, like, Mr. Yeaman, is that the gentleman we saw who wrote the report saying we're in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And Fred Hoss, whose name we saw on the last document?

A.   Correct.

Q.   The policy committee -- the report continues --set up another committee of lawyers known as the ad hoc group.

Would that include the lawyer on behalf of Philip Morris -- two lawyers on behalf of Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And, again, Mr. Hoss's name is there and let me ask:  Janet Brown, is she the Janet Brown that you referred to earlier who made a comment later on about a nicotine blocker could put the industry out of business overnight?

A.   She wrote that memo for CTR, so she was sort of external counsel to CTR, Council for Tobacco Research.

Q.   And it indicates, "The lawyers are thus the most powerful group in the smoking and health situation. It's uncertain, however, whether the presidents of the three smaller companies are fully in agreement with this situation, considering the lawyers to be too restrictive and too dominant generally in the industry.  They are, however, neither powerful enough nor sufficiently sure of themselves to do anything about it."

What is the significance in terms of what you've been talking to the jury about, Dr. Cummings, of lawyer control that we see expressed in this document? MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object and

request to approach at this point.

THE COURT:  You may.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MR. GERAGHTY:  Over my objection yesterday, Your Honor said that you would allow some discussion of the fact that the documents reflect that lawyers were involved.  I understand that.

But now the question is -- put to this expert, what is the significance of the fact that lawyers were involved.

First of all, I don't think that's even calling for an expert opinion.  That's calling for this --Dr. Cummings's personal opinions about all of that.

Secondly, Your Honor, we have a finding that there was an agreement to conceal and I think at this point who was involved specifically in the agreement to conceal, whether it was lawyers or businessmen or medical doctors or bench chemists at the companies, is irrelevant, because we have the finding.

The documents speak for themselves.  Anything he says at this point is just going to be highly prejudicial.  And I think we've reached a point where the probative value of what Dr. Cummings may

say about the significance of lawyers being involved is far outweighed by the potential prejudice that the jury is going to begin to think.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  With regard to the --the -- again, I know that I entered a pretrial ruling in -- in O'Hara, but I'm not certain that I recall whether the same one was entered here.

It said that if there was an interpretation of the document, of what the document said, he could do that.  He could separately interpret the document.

This particular question was what is the significance of what this document just said about lawyers, and it was pretty clear what it said about lawyers.  They're not powerful enough, you know, to -- to do this thing that -- that needs to be done.

So this reaching -- isn't this just sort of reaching for pure opinion testimony now?

MR. SCHULTZ:  No, Your Honor.  What I'm trying to elicit and what I intend to elicit is that we're going to hear through cross-examination, and we've already heard in the evidence that they told the public that the scientific advisory board was independent.

Typically, they'll come in on cross and show

that they won Nobel Prizes.  They're still going to tell the jury in a sense they did great work.  The fact is the work they were doing was controlled by lawyers, and it's completely contrary to what they told the public they were going to do.

And it shows that they were not an independent body, which is precisely what the Frank Statement told them they were going to be.  It's a sham.  They acknowledge it's a sham in their own documents.

What I'm trying to do is get Dr. Cummings to point out the significance of this as not just the fact that lawyers are -- have control of the smoking and health question; it's completely to put it in the context of what the industry told the public.

And I've heard several times this suggestion that we're not supposed to talk about what the conspiracy was.

Um, I think Mr. Geraghty is confusing relitigation or with -- the litigation part doesn't bar evidence of the conspiracy.  We have to show the jury, naturally, what was concealed in order for them to know what mattered, i.e., whether it was a cause.  This is how it was carried out.

The point of all of this is that they said we're going to have independent scientists.  They're

getting to the bottom of the question.  They said this for four years.  It was never true.  The lawyers were in control the whole time.

THE COURT:  I thought that was exactly what he said what -- reading from the document, pointing out that these were lawyer committees.  They were two separate lawyer committees.  You've just explained that clearly from the document.  And then --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes.

THE COURT:  -- the question is if the document communicates that and the separate independent thing in which he is saying what the document says, what is the significance of that?  That's the part that I thought was --

MR. SCHULTZ:  I guess the question I could ask is because it's a real point, Judge, is does control of the lawyers extend the control of the scientific advisory board.  The document says smoking and health questions.  The question I'm trying to get to is whether it includes the SAB.

THE COURT:  Again, with regard to what this document says and what this document says, you know, the -- what was being reflected as the decision-makers in this, that's the evidence coming through, not his opinion or speculation or his

interpretation.  And I think that's the difference where we are.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I understand, Judge.  I'm not trying to suggest that this document says that.  The whole reason for the question is the document doesn't say that.

He's an expert on these documents.  I'm simply asking him did lawyer control of the smoking and health question include lawyer control of the scientific advisory board.  And I'm going to ask a bad question instead of the question that I asked, which was more open-ended.

THE COURT:  But his expertise is based upon the study of the documents and that -- that's the route. That's where we are.  I mean, he's permitted to come in here and give us a historical view, bringing up all of these documents and basically trying to show us -- go through all of this; but then when he adds his spin or interpretation on it, does he have the expertise to do that?  Or is that simply just a reasonable inference of what the jury is permitted to draw from what he's doing?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, then what I would do, Your Honor, is put up another document that directly shows exactly what I'm trying to ask him.  I didn't

understand that I had to put up a document for everything that he says.  I have a document in my redirect folder that shows very clearly the SAB itself protested lawyer control.

THE COURT:  Well, again, the important point is that I'm not saying a document for everything.  I'm saying where the document itself basically says this is what we mean, you know, and explains -- it's -- I thought -- again, I know I ruled in O'Hara.  I thought that it was a ruling here in which I say, look, his reading these documents and then saying, you know, I interpret the document to mean so and so.  That was the verboten part of it.

He can certainly tie these things together by showing one link after another; that is, that the document clearly concludes or interprets itself. Absolutely he's permitted to reflect that to the jury.

So I think that's where we are in terms of saying, you know, what is the significance of this and him saying, well, in my opinion, the significance of this is so and so.

Let's just do what you're doing.  He's just walking through the documents.  If you've got the documents, you can present them.  If they're

not here, then you'11 need to argue a reasonable inference.

Thank you.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And I appreciate that, Your Honor.  The other thing I will say, though, is Your Honor did say that we had to -- I can't remember exactly how you phrased it, but you said we needed to make a wide berth around this potential --you know, all this talk about lawyers and smearing the lawyers who were actually defending Philip Morris in this case.

And I think the overemphasis that's now being placed with the lawyer involvement, we're running afoul of that.

I mean, he's put up -- he put up two charts yesterday that talked about the lawyers and the involvement of the lawyers.  He's shown at least a half dozen documents, if not more, that have talked about the involvement of the lawyers.

I mean, I really think that it -- we have to expect that the jury is going to be misled and confused about that.  And when they keep hearing about lawyers, they're going to think, well, they may also mean Mr. Geraghty and Ms. Diolombi.  They may think, well, maybe Dr. Dorce is on the payroll

of Philip Morris.

I mean, you know, that's where we're going with this undue emphasis on lawyers being involved in this process, when the real issue is --

THE COURT:  The point is, is it undue or not? And that's -- that's the "how high is that" kind of argument that I have to ultimately make.

Where we are right now and the responses to the Surgeon General's Report and how the industry then came together to do that and if they formed lawyer committees, they formed lawyer committees.  And you can't, in essence -- you just can't... um, take the real facts out of it.

But, again, the point that I made was that you certainly cannot in any way insinuate that the defense of this lawsuit or lawsuits like this today are -- the lawyers involved in them are in some way implicated in a cover-up or concealment, or -- or -- or inappropriate activity.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Right.

THE COURT:  So that line has got to be drawn. But --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Right.

THE COURT:  � I can't � the history, I can't change that.  There were lawyers involved.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, I'm not suggesting Your Honor can change the history, but at some point the cumulative nature of testimony and evidence like this has the potential to confuse the jury about what the real issue is in the case.

And, look, there are hundreds of documents that don't mention lawyers that he could choose to use that talk about what was said publicly; that minimized, denied or, you know, flat-out just said "Cigarette smoking hasn't been shown to cause lung cancer" that don't make mention of lawyers.

So, I mean, since they've made a strategic decision that this is what they want to select to show the jury and -- and, Your Honor, I think it --we're getting to the point where, if we continue down this road we are going to have a problem, and I'm going to have to stand up and make a motion.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor �

THE COURT:  I understand your position.  To the extent it's stated as an objection to this document being introduced, I will overrule the objection.

Thank you.

You understand my instruction, though?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I -- I do, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  And the question -- last question that was asked, I do sustain his objection to the last question that was asked.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I understand.

And just very briefly, Your Honor, so the record is clear, the last document I used, for example, had a whole section that I intended to go into, talking about how the Surgeon General's Report made it tough for them to get expert witnesses.  I skipped over that because of what you -- the concern you expressed yesterday.  I'm staying away from expert witnesses, even though there's lots of evidence of it, in order to avoid the sort of suggestion Mr. Geraghty's making.

So I am making an effort.  And I heard your rule or your concern yesterday about that issue and we are giving it a wide berth.

THE COURT:  Thank you all.

are discussed in the 1964 report.

Were these the same attorneys or some of them who served in sort of executive roles over at the CTR and the TI?

A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'd like to, if we could please,

Ryan, pull up LP0277. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   This is a document entitled "The Cigarette Controversy:  An Action Program" from November of 1967.

Are you familiar with this document, Dr. Cummings?

A.   I am.

Q.   And it's put out by an organization called the Tiderock Corporation.

Who was the Tiderock Corporation?

A.   Well, they were a public relations marketing firm that was hired by the Tobacco Institute.

So this is their proposal to the Tobacco Institute in 1967,  and they, in fact, outlined things that they proposed to do that were subsequently -- they were hired and were implemented.

Q.   And under the heading "Strategy" we see the objective is to influence public opinion so that it is, if not favorable toward the tobacco industry, certainly

not negative.

Does that express the charge or the -- the goal of Tiderock's work for the industry?

A.   Yes, it does.

Q.   And according to this document, Dr. Cummings, how did they go about carrying out this campaign to reestablish the cigarette controversy?

A.   Well, the -- basically they outline a plan to reach the general public, the, you know, opinion leaders who said the program must be massive to counter the pressure from the Clearinghouse.  The Clearinghouse was the government agency that put out the Surgeon General's Reports which, after 1965, were mandated to come out on an annual basis.

And so they're talking in terms of counteracting this program needed to exceed 50 million a year, and then they go forward and outline in this proposal how to go about doing this with getting -- you know, reestablishing the cigarette controversy, putting out an annual white paper that would come out -- and, in fact, that did happen from 1968 to '84.  Every year you got the white papers, just like the original one from '60 -- or from '54 called "The Cigarette Controversy." You had ghost writing of articles to get articles in popular magazines and so on.  And they facilitated doing

that again.

So they're basically -- after the Surgeon General's Reports comes out, they talk about re-upping and reestablishing the controversy to keep it going. MR. SCHULTZ:  If we look at the next page,

Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Was the general public one of the targets of the information campaign?

A.   Yes.  You know, the general public and then molders of public opinion.  And they talk about lawmakers and so on and -- and then people within the industry, industry groups -- distributors, suppliers, stockholders -- and then employees of the industry.

So this is sort of giving you their -- their target audience that they wanted to reach.

Q.   And you mention a white paper.  Did one come out the following year, in 1968?

A.   Yes.  White papers came out, actually, annually from 1968 to 1984.  And they were written for the lay public, and they were widely distributed to these different groups.

So if you ever wrote to the Tobacco Institute, they'd send you their white paper, which was like --designed as a Q&A, you know.  "Does cigarette smoking

cause lung cancer?" The answer: "No. It's a -- it's a closed -- it's a -- it's an open debate, and the -- more research is needed."

Those are the kinds of statements that you would see.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, would the white papers, like the '68 cigarette controversy, be distributed to the --the public, to opinion leaders, as we saw in -- in accordance with the Tiderock plan?

A.   Yes.  They would often highlight people within them, like, "Leading scientists challenge the evidence." In fact, I think in 1968 they highlighted Harry Greene, the pathologist from Yale University.  He was the only person who disputed the evidence that cigarette smoking caused cancer back in 1958.

Q.   And was Philip Morris money and other tobacco company money used to fund all of this work?

A.   Yes.  Extensively.  As I said, the TI budgets increased dramatically.  And particularly in this period, right after 1964, they started to spend more money on public relations, hiring outside companies like Tiderock to produce these materials for them, as well as hiring individuals, public relations specialists who travel around the country and speak on behalf of the companies.

Q.   And if they look -- and this is LP1540, by the way -- at Page 38, they indicate:  "The American Tobacco industry has contributed millions of dollars for independent research on smoking and health.  During the past 13 years the industry has supported over 300 independent health studies through the industry's Council for Tobacco Research USA."

Is that referring, Dr. Cummings, to the research that the British American Tobacco Company executives commented on in the earlier document we saw?

A.   Yes.  I mean, they were funding research.  Much of that research, as I pointed out, had little to do with smoking and -- and health.  But they were funding research.

They don't comment on special projects, so that was the one thing -- you know, they said it's an independent board of scientists.  Well, the Scientific Advisory Board did make recommendations on some of the research that they funded, but there is also --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is nonresponsive and cumulative at this point.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And the question being, Dr. Cummings, when we see the tobacco industry in this report saying, "Look, we've poured a lot of money into research trying to get to the bottom of this question," does that refer to the same research that the British American Tobacco executives commented on?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you've already talked about that with the jury.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Let's take a look if we could,

Ryan, at LP0616, please. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   This is a 1968 Hill & Knowlton document. Dr. Cummings, are you familiar with this?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I've got it. MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And it's a memorandum to William Kloepfer.  Who was he at the TI?

A.   He was the vice president in charge of public relations.

Q.   And he's talking about the production of Tobacco and Health Research.  And that's underlined. What was Tobacco and Health Research?

A.   That was a newsletter that was sent out.  It was created by the Tobacco Institute, and they would send this out to medical doctors, again, opinion leaders.

It was a newsletter format, and it used headlines; so citing articles on issues related to smoking and health.

Typically when you actually look at the newsletters, they were articles challenging the evidence that cigarette smoking caused disease.

Q.   And does this help explain or illustrate what you were just describing, primary audience were doctors and scientists?

A.   Correct.  And then the secondary audience is the news media.

Q. And would doctors and scientists, Dr. Cummings, be examples of the opinion leaders that we saw they were trying to influence in the Tiderock memorandum?

A.   Sure.  That was one of the categories.

Q. And if we look down at the bottom the document, we have criteria for selection of articles.

First, the reports should be on new research, if possible.  It may not always deal with some aspect of tobacco; for example, a report indicating some factor or factors other than smoking may be involved in one of the diseases with which smoking has been associated.

Other examples -- and then they list some -- a report in which statistics of smoking-associated diseases are questioned, one in which death certificates or classifications are questioned, one showing many lung cancers may be metastatic or from some other organ. Is that some other organ than the lung?

A.   Correct.

Q.   One indicating a virus may cause human cancer, whether or not that cancer is associated with smoking. Research with animals, indicating some other factor may be involved with carcinogenesis or ciliostasis.

Are these the types of comments or stories that we heard from the tobacco industry publicly, going

forward from this point in time?

A.   Yes.  And so this is a memo from Hill & Knowlton to the Tobacco Institute as how to select the research they were putting in this newsletter that they would widely distribute.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we look at the next page,

please, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And if we look at the top of the page, it says: "The most important type of story is that which casts doubt on the cause-and-effeet theory of disease and smoking."

How long are we now out from that 1958 meeting when everyone in the industry told BAT that they believed in causation?

A.   Ten years.

Q.   If we look down, it says:  "Headlines should be very carefully written on the premise that doctors and scientists, like other readers, often grab information from the headlines and nothing more; thus the headlines should strongly call out the point:  Controversy, contradiction, other factors, unknowns."

Are these consistent themes going forward from the industry?

A.   Yes.  It's -- when you look at the actual

newsletters, that's exactly what you see.  They're challenging the evidence, and, therefore, it's still an open debate.  It's a question as to whether cigarette smoking causes disease.  It's a scientific controversy rather than accepted scientific fact.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And can we pull up, please, LP3168, Ryan.

MR. GERAGHTY:  3168?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Would these be examples -- this is going back to '58 -- examples of a tobacco industry publication on the issues of smoking and health?

A.   Yes.  They -- the -- this particular newsletter, tobacco and health newsletter, you know, came out -- from 1958 on was put out by the Tobacco Institute and was created by a public relations firm. And they would search articles, and these were the kinds of headlines you would see.

And they tried to put it out monthly, although sometimes they couldn't find enough articles that contradicted the evidence.  So they didn't always put it out on a monthly basis.

But if you showed up with the media, as I often did, they would have these in their portfolio sent by

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object and move to strike as nonresponsive.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.  Deny the request to strike.

MR. SCHULTZ:  All right.  Can we go back to the PowerPoint, please, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   So we've talked about some of the things the industry said publicly.

And we're looking now at LP0415, "Confidential Philip Morris USA R&D Strategic Plan."

And it indicates:  "The controversy regarding smoking and health will continue to foster both governmental and private antismoking efforts," in talking about gas phase components, filter performance, effects of smoke on nonsmokers.  "Without an effective countereffort by cigarette makers, there is likely to be an erosion of the social acceptability of smoking. Whereas smoking has traditionally been viewed by adolescents and young adults as sophisticated adult behavior to be emulated, it is in danger of being regarded generally as undesirable behavior to be avoided."

Is this from a confidential document, first of

all, from Philip Morris?

A.   Yes, it is.

Q.   And so my question, Dr. Cummings, is, in addition to the public statements that we've talked about, was part of this conspiracy that you've described to the jury to keep smoking normalized?

A.   Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Objection to the form,

Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

A.   Yes, it was. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Would this, Dr. Cummings, what we see on this slide, a memo from Frank Welch, who's indicated as vice president of TI, Tobacco Institute, to Earle Clements, the president, be an example of what you were just describing, trying to keep smoking normalized?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And how so?

A.   Well, they fought efforts that would basically try to educate the public about the dangers of smoking. And, of course, there were a number of legislative efforts, both at the federal and state level.  This is referring, here in Florida, to bills that were introduced and were opposed.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, can we approach about this, please?

THE COURT:  You may.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MR. GERAGHTY:  First of all, I have two issues. One is, with all due respect to Mr. Schultz, he's going at warp speed to the point where I can't even get the document out and realize what's going on. And he skipped over some of the slides, and that's exacerbating it.  But I'm just asking that I have the opportunity to pull these documents up before they're flashed on the screen and there are questions, number one.

Number two, this next document that they just put up is a document that talks about opposing smoking restrictions in public.  That is the, Philip Morris, other members of the industry, invoking their First Amendment rights in that sense, and that can't be part of the conspiracy, Your Honor.  That's not the conspiracy.  It's an agreement to conceal information about the health risks and addictive nature of smoking.  This is not within the scope of the conspiracy, as defined by the Engle finding that we're bound by.

And I think we're getting far afield of the issues in the case, and I would object on relevance and 403 grounds.

THE COURT:  With regard to giving him time to get the document out, please do that.

With regard to the other thing, again, we discussed this issue about whether they have a right to go to the Congressmen or legislators in Florida or in any other state or federal government to petition the government or to oppose legislation. And, you know, I've got that instruction that tells us what the law is, and I'll -- that's not bad conduct to do that if they're not misrepresenting or stating anything falsely.  So, I mean, to the extent that you say, were they opposing something in Florida, I think it really has to -- you know, in order to prevent something in Florida, did they misrepresent before the legislature, the Florida legislature?

Do you understand?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I do understand that, Judge.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Just saying they're bad people because they opposed legislation is not permitted.  As I understand it, this expression refers to (inaudible).

MR. SCHULTZ:  I appreciate that, Your Honor.

And, so we're clear, that's not the suggestion. The suggestion is that the concealment was not only to withhold information from people but to keep smoking culture what it was.

But I do understand your point on this.  I have another slide on this, and I'll skip over it.  And the curative instruction that they requested, I won't oppose that, Your Honor.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, I'll just point out, this was an issue I moved for a mistrial on yesterday. Your Honor overruled that motion, but I thought this was supposed to be out of bounds.

THE COURT:  It's already been ruled that it was out of bounds previously.  And, you know, I can give a curative instruction, but I think it's just -- and it may be appropriate to give it right now in light of what was said.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm not so sure I want the curative instruction.  What I would like to have is a statement from the Court to the jury that they should disregard the last question and answer from the witness.  I think that's fair.

I think we're going to propose a slightly different, um, curative instruction that perhaps

Your Honor can include in the final package, but it's not going to be exactly what Your Honor said yesterday.  That's why --

THE COURT:  Okay.  The -- rather than say to "disregard the last question and answer," his last response just before your objection was, "This is referring here in the Florida bills that were introduced and that were opposed."  And that particular statement was the objectionable statement that I would tell them to disregard.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, I'd rather you not repeat the statement he just made, Your Honor.  This is --

THE COURT:  I understand.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I mean, I have been doing this forever, but I've been doing it long enough to know that I don't want them to be reminded of the prejudicial statement.

THE COURT:  That's always the dilemma.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, my request is that they be asked to disregard the last question and answer, and Mr. Schultz can go back and ask an appropriate question.

THE COURT:  I'm not going to do -- to --because the last question was, "And how so?"  In the answer, he talked about other things that are

perfectly legitimate.  But then when he went off in his last sentence of that answer and said, "What I just referred to."  That is the objectionable part, and --

MR. SCHULTZ:  So I'm clear, Your Honor -- I don't want to extend these bench conferences.  The jury is going to be told, "If you don't hear evidence of misrepresentation, you can't find the conduct liable."  That doesn't mean that the evidence is irrelevant.

The effect that this had is relevant in the case -- the effect of normalization is relevant, but if there's no misstatement made, it cannot be a basis for liability.  That doesn't mean the evidence has no relevance in the trial.

I understand your ruling, and I'm going to move past it, and I'm going to do my best not to come close to finding myself in this situation again.

But just so the plaintiff's position is clear, the evidence has relevance.  They can be told it can't be a basis for liability, and that's fine. That's what the instruction says.

THE COURT:  Let me make it clear.  If I'm sitting as a juror and I'm hearing that we're here on a concealment case, and I hear that there -- that

the defendant is opposing legislation, then it immediately tells me that they're doing something wrong, you know, that -- the implication is that this was good legislation that would have brought out good information, but they opposed the legislation.  And that act of opposing legislation, without hearing anything more, is going to seem to me as if you're communicating that they committed bad conduct there.

And that's exactly my understanding of what cannot be communicated, that that is a privilege to oppose it.  And that privilege, that right to oppose legislation or seek to influence legislation, is perfectly acceptable free speech.  But if in responding to that legislation -- not using the word "opposing," but if in responding to that legislation they, then, misrepresent things to the legislators, now that's bad conduct.  Okay?

And so I see a clear distinction here in seeing where I can just tell them that there was all this legislation they were opposing, and I'm not really commenting on their right to petition for redirect. No, I think that's exactly the problem.  I think you're perfectly welcome in saying, you know, when responding to legislation, show us what proof you

have that they actually committed acts of fraud and misrepresentation and concealment.  That's fair game.  Okay?  So you and I are not misunderstanding my ruling on that.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And that would not extend to statements made to the public in opposition to --

THE COURT:  Oh, absolutely.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.  I understand, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I may need ten seconds to look at the next thing to make sure that I'm not running afoul, because it's opposition to a nonsmoking -- a smoking ban in Miami-Dade, and I need to make -- I need to make sure that what they're talking about is funding a public campaign, which is my belief, before I ask the question.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, can you --

MR. SCHULTZ:  We can bring the -- actually,

let's leave it down for a moment, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Can you tell the jury who TAN was, T-A-N?

A.   Sure.  Tobacco Action Network was funded by the Tobacco Institute, and, you know, basically they would put out information, you know, related to legislative efforts, largely to restrict smoking both at the state, federal, local level.

Q. And let me ask you, Dr. Cummings, before you continue. When you say "put out information," do you mean put out information to the public?

A.   Yes.

Q. And this was, I think you already described, funded by the industry?

A.   Was funded by the industry, by the Tobacco Institute, in particular.  They often had things that they would put out, you know, in advance of the Great American Smokeout, sort of an anti-effort that was done as part of the TAN network.  They had mailing lists. They set up businesses that I've actually seen, you know, in Buffalo, when I was there, you know, at certain times to lobby the public and put out information.

Q.   This is a document, Dr. Cummings, from Mr. Tucker to a Mr. Bewley regarding Dade County Florida from 1979.

Are you familiar with this document? A.   Yes.

Q.   And does this discuss a meeting of TAN coordinators, the same network that you just described that puts out information to the public?

Who was Ernie Pepples? A.   He was the -- he came after Addison Yeaman.  He was chief general counsel of Brown & Williamson in the late '70s.

Q.   And this is June of 1981, and he has a following list of what he calls plus and minus items. And if we look down at the bottom, on the plus side it says, "Defeat of 1978" --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Excuse me, Your Honor.  I would object for the reasons previously stated, and I have a motion.

THE COURT:  Please approach.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

THE COURT:  With regard to this -- I mean, the first thing I looked at was on the left side.  They were communicating to the public of things that they (inaudible) plus, and that was defeating certain legislation.

Again, that was at the discretion of their lobbying efforts and the petitioning of the government redress, and the government's been trying to pass the bill, and they say that "we oppose that

bill."

Now, if they -- if the fact of their opposing it and the fact that it's being defeated is a protected privileged area of -- under the doctrine, then the fact that it was communicated to somebody else doesn't make the -- doesn't make that substantive issue unprivileged.

And -- I think maybe my discussion of it confused you in terms of where you were going because it doesn't mean they can then go out and brag to the public.  I mean, it doesn't mean that --that they can be shown to be bad people or having engaged in bad conduct because they opposed it.

The very opposing of it is the privileged activity and to have communicated that doesn't make it unprivileged activity.  That's -- I don't know how to say it any different.

Seems to me that's what that document is doing. Here are successes and one of our successes is defeating this fact.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's right, Your Honor.  The purpose of it -- the previous document I just showed, I laid the foundation with Dr. Cummings that the Tobacco Action Network is out there making statements to the public.  If you want me to ask him

whether they were the same messages that -- that the industry always put out, maybe that would get closer to a foundation if that's the concern.

The point is not that they've defeated it or saying they're bad guys; they defeated it.  The point is, is the message works.  That's the -- and that's the question that I'm getting to.

When they go out and speak to the public, it has an effect on the public.  I limited it to that. I'm not suggesting in any way that there should be liability on the industry because they defeated it.

They went out, they spread their message to the public, and it works.  They're going to say the message we sent for 40 years had no effect on anybody.  Well, their own documents belie that motion, Your Honor.

And if the jury needs to be told, look, now, when you hear this evidence, you can't hold them liable simply for defeating it or for their First Amendment rights, I have no problem with that, Judge.  That's the law.

But that's not the purpose for the evidence coming in.  It's coming in for the very relevant purpose to show when they speak -- you know, when they talk, people listen.  That's the evidence.  It

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I'm going to renew my motion for mistrial.  This is talking about defeating -- this passage that was flashed on the screen talks about defeating a 1978 and 1980 initiative proposition in Dade County and in California.

The issue in this case that he's talking about -- we're not going to say it didn't influence anybody.  We're going to say it didn't influence Lamar Danielson.

I realize that under Martin there's an inference that because our advertising was widespread, the jury can infer that he may have relied and acted upon that, but this is not what Martin was talking about.

Martin was talking about prevalent advertising in the '40s and the '50s and the '60s that was on television and radio and newspapers to the point that you couldn't miss it, according to the Martin court.

This is completely different.  These are legislative proposals in the State of California and in Dade County, Florida, where I live, and the --there is absolutely no nexus between these things

and Lamar Danielson.

On top of that, I understand Dr. Cummings, if he were asked the question, would surely say -- I know he would say that, oh, in opposing legislation at some point over the 50-year period we're talking about with this conspiracy, I'm sure they made false statements; but we're talking about specific episodes here, and there are no exhibits or documents that show that any particular statements that were made by Philip Morris or any other alleged member of this agreement to conceal that were false as part of these particular legislative proposals.

Your Honor denied a motion for mistrial. You've warned Mr. Schultz yesterday.  You warned him again at sidebar less than ten minutes ago, and here we are back at it.  I've had to jump up now three times in less than ten minutes, and so the prejudicial effect at this point is enormous.

And I move for a mistrial and I think we need to put a stop to this whole issue because it's a complete red herring, given the issues in this case. I've tried 16 cases.  I've never seen that document. He doesn't need to use that document.

MR. SCHULTZ:  (Inaudible) yesterday.  And I'm not going there based on the (inaudible).

THE COURT:  Okay.  The � the part that is the offensive part that is -- at the very least is capable of confusion, it cannot be projected without me -- I'm struggling to see what you -- you're describing what the application of it is.  I see all the other stuff, but defeating referendums -- which we don't know what the referendums were and it doesn't really matter because it was an exercise of their right to try to petition for re-dress at the legislative institution.  They have a right to do that.  They did that.

And if -- if it's not communicated why the referendum is there, what does it tell you?  What does it communicate to the public in terms of a concealment or a fraud or anything of that nature?

Anything else on there is perfectly fine showing that this is what we're considering --that's a good thing and -- and that's fine.

But, again, at this point in time I feel like I need to give a curative instruction, because that's the first thing they saw.  When you flash it up, you read left to right.  You know, at least in this culture, and, you know, that's the first thing they would have seen, so that's my concern.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I understand.

THE COURT:  And anything else you have that's like that, I think I have a real problem with this balancing test of -- if it's -- if it's a 9403 problem, it's purely objectionable.  I just don't see a relevant material reason for that particular comment to come in.

But you can -- I see the rest of the document, and it's perfectly fine.  I don't have a problem with that.  But that's back to the same thing I was talking about and I thought we had an understanding.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I thought I did, Your Honor, and I've stated my position.  The relevance point I was going to get to -- and I'm not going to, and I understand that -- is Tobacco Action Network goes out and speaks on behalf of the industry.  The message works.  That is precisely the basis for the Martin inference.

You can infer that it worked on other people and it worked on the rest of America on this chart. Lamar Danielson is no different from these people.

The point of this was not that they're bad people for defeating; the point is when they speak, the public responds.  They're receptive to the industry message.  That's where I was going.

I understand I'm not going to go there, but I

don't want there to be a suggestion that this -- I'm trying to sneak around your ruling.  That's not my intent, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I just -- I believe that that -- on that particular part, the -- the potential for misleading and confusing the jury is high on that particular part of that document.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I understand.

THE COURT:  So the document can -- the rest of the document can be exhibited; but on that particular thing, I think it's probably best to just redact that.  If you want to show the rest of the document, feel free to use it in your case in an appropriate manner.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.  I understand, Judge.

it -- you make misstatements.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's the whole point --

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'll show it to Your Honor and I'll show it to Mr. Schultz first.

THE COURT:  If I give that last statement --because I don't want them to think that it can't be used for any purpose.

MR. GERAGHTY: I don't think the jury is going to have that conclusion -- draw that conclusion. I would -- I would object to that last statement.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, that would be misleading to the jury to suggest there's never any relevance, especially for what was shown.  They're substantively the same as what --

THE COURT:  Under the facts of the case that we have heard already, I would not eliminate that last statement in any curative instruction.  So if you want the curative instruction, you get it with that statement.  If you are not requesting a curative instruction, then I won't give it.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't think I want that statement.  Maybe I'll reconsider over the break. Thank you, Your Honor.

hearing of the jury.)

THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, I -- for just a moment I want to apologize.  These things happen. Even though you know I gave you some fair warning to think -- that things like this might happen, it doesn't lessen the discomfort.

I appreciate that your time -- I value your time.  We're trying to keep these discussions as short as possible.  Hopefully we've resolved some things up here that will cause us not to have so many.

If -- if it persists, then we'll go ahead and take a break -- let you take a break and we'll sit in here and we'11 get some things hammered out before we bring you back in.  Because I know this herky-jerky style of presentation is -- is kind of disruptive to your focus, and being able to consider the evidence that's being presented.

But, again, don't hold it against one party or the other.  There are matters of law that we have to consider and it's my job to make sure they're considered as expeditiously as possible, and to use your time wisely.  I'm going to keep trying to do that and also trying to do all my other jobs.  Thank you.

Mr. Schultz.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Your Honor. Ryan, if we could pull that back up.  And I want to look at the minus column on the right-hand side of the document from Mr. Pepples.

Do you need this copy back, Mr. Geraghty? MR. GERAGHTY:  No.  That's okay.  I think I've got it somewhere. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   We were discussing, Dr. Cummings, some pluses and minuses according to counsel for Brown & Williamson. On the minus side we see Surgeon General's Reports, Federal Trade Commission Reports.

Would these include the sort of Federal Trade Commission Reports we've already shown the jury in this case?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And papers on how quitting smoking might reduce heart disease, articles on smoking in newspapers.

Was it consistent -- did the industry consistently -- and by industry I mean the Tobacco Institute, Philip Morris, and the others -- consistently oppose, wherever possible, these sorts of minuses?

A.   Yes.  I mean, you would see certainly a reaction when Surgeon General's Reports would come out

from the companies or an article suggesting that smoking was the cause of disease or removing smoking prevents disease.

You would see typically a -- a statement from the industry in the media as sort of a counterweight to that saying it hadn't been proven, the controversy.

Q.   We've heard Mr. Cullman's name several times.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Ryan, if we could go back to the PowerPoint. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Did he appear on television on Face the Nation in the early 1970s?

A.   Yes.  1971, I think this is January 3rd, so he was on Face the Nation.  The relevance of that was cigarette advertising had just come off broadcast television and radio.  He appeared on the show -- of course, he's president of Philip Morris, but he appeared as the chairman of the tobacco industry -- or Tobacco Institute executive committee and was asked a variety of questions on issues related to smoking and health.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we play that clip, please, Ryan?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, real briefly.  I just need about 30 seconds to approach on this. THE COURT:  Yes.  Approach.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MR. GERAGHTY:  I just want to make sure I lodge an objection.  I -- I don't know how Your Honor ruled on this in O'Hara, so I apologize that I don't know that.  I -- I should.

This clip, if I understand correctly, has the passage where Mr. Cullman -- at some point he's asked a question and he says some women would prefer having smaller babies.  A very inappropriate, offensive statement.

THE COURT:  We have addressed that in this case already.

MR. GERAGHTY:  That's what I was going to say. Well, Judge, my understanding was Judge Bell didn't exclude it.  That's my understanding.  I don't know what Your Honor did in O'Hara.  I think it's a 403 issue or under the balancing test, the prejudice far outweighs it.

THE COURT:  I guess I just simply read the discussion that was held of -- in the argument, the pretrial, before Judge Bell.  That's what it was.

MR. SCHULTZ:  It was, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I would overrule the objection. Thank you.

MALE SPEAKER:  From CBS Washington, in color, Face the Nation.  A spontaneous and unrehearsed news interview with Joseph Cullman, III, chairman and chief executive officer of Philip Morris Incorporated, and chairman of the executive committee of the Tobacco Institute.

MALE SPEAKER:  We have no program that I know of to try to help people to stop smoking.  We -- we do talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous.  We do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous.  We don't accept that.

And if this industry can face the future with

confidence because when and if any ingredient in

cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious to

human health, we were confident that we can

eliminate that ingredient.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, was Mr. Cullman prepared before he appeared on this show, by the Tobacco Institute?

A.   Yes, he was.  Their public relations people, you know, spent quite a bit of time working with him as he prepped for the show.

Q.   And how long has it been now, by the time of this appearance in 1971, since Mr. Wakeham made his presentation to the R&D committee saying there are class -- carcinogens in every class of compound and we can't take them out?

A.   It's about ten years, nine to ten years.

MR. SCHULTZ:  We have an additional clip from

under five and a half pounds approximately, than the babies born by mothers who did not smoke, and there was a higher rate of stillbirths and of deaths within 28 days of birth.

My question is, in view of this study, which is the largest and most elaborate of its kind ever made, is it right to promote smoking among women with Virginia Slims and the other brands especially marketed for them with no warning as to the danger to the embryo that may exist?

MR. CULLMAN:  Well, you're reading that question because it's a complicated question.

I would say that I did read that report, and I concluded from that report that it's true that babies born from women who smoke are smaller, but they're just as healthy as the babies born to women who do not smoke.

MR. MINTZ:  What about �

MR. CULLMAN:  Some women would prefer having

smaller babies.

to the health message on smoking?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object to the form of

that question, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll overrule the objection.

I'm a little -- maybe I could ask you to rephrase

it.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, let me ask this question,

if I may, instead, Your Honor. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Was humor and quips -- was that sort of putting a light touch on the "controversy," as they called it? Was that part of the campaign by the industry?

A.   Yes.  It's talked about inside their own internal documents.  I think we saw one of the documents yesterday that talked about -- I think it was George Weissman to Joe Cullman that responded in the Surgeon General's Report, and if you read that full document, they talk about the use of cartoons and humor to put a light touch on the -- I think that's actually the term they used, "light touch," in that particular document.

So that was one of their public relations strategies to try to deflect attention away from the very serious problem of cigarette smoking causing so many serious illnesses.

Q.   And if we -- could you tell the jury, please,

who Mr. Jim Bowling was.

A.   He was the vice president in charge of sales, and also served on the Tobacco Institute executive committee and was a frequent spokesperson when the media came and asked Philip Morris about issues related to smoking and health.  He would often speak on their behalf.

Q.   And this is LP2273.  I'll give Mr. Geraghty a moment.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I've got it. MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Wall Street Journal, Monday, January 24th, 1972, Mr. Bowling says:  "'If our product is harmful,'" says James Bowling, vice president of Philip Morris, 'We'll stop making it.  We now know enough that we can take anything out of our product, but we don't know what ingredients to take out.'"

Is that consistent, Mr. Cummings --Dr. Cummings, with the message we've heard all the way going back to the '60s now?

A.   Actually, back into the, you know, '50s, you heard Clarence Cook Little, I think, in his interview on See It Now, where he said if there's anything harmful in cigarettes, they would remove it.  They would make it

known to the public.  And you see that refrain made repeatedly over and over and again.

Q.   And was that -- with respect to Philip Morris specifically, was that the first time Mr. Bowling's statement -- or last time Philip Morris made a statement like that?

A.   No.  The statement that if they ever found that their products were harmful to human health that they would stop business is a statement you see made repeatedly.  The first time I saw that statement was in two -- two speeches made by George Weissman in 1954, speaking, one, to vending machine operators, so the distribution of tobacco, and then another -- two, another trade association.

Q.   And are those the ones that we see up on the screen?

A.   Yeah.  One was in February.  The other was in March.  It was right after the Frank Statement had come out, and they go on the road, basically, to talk about the industry's position.  And Mr. Weissman says, "If anyone believed that the product we are making and selling was in any way harmful to our customers' health and our own as well, we would voluntarily go out of business."

Q.   Let me ask you to pause, Dr. Cummings.

Can we wait a moment, Dr. Cummings? A.   Sure.

MR. GERAGHTY:  That's fine.  I just � I need to approach about one of the issues.  So I don't --I don't know if Your Honor wants to take break now. I don't want to --

MR. GERAGHTY:  The -- the issue is the last statement.  That's after Mr. -- that's after Mr. Danielson had passed away.

I didn't have a problem with the early -- the first two statements, and they're consistent with the statement that we just heard from the Wall Street Journal article.

So that's in a deposition he gave in 1997.

So I thought we had an agreement that statements that could be considered tortious after

from Mr. Jim Bowling in 1972 in the New York Times?

Q.   We've seen Dr. Wakeham's name several times. Can you remind the jury who he would have been in 1976?

A.   Yeah.  He was vice president in charge of research and development at -- at Philip Morris.

Q.   And just so we're clear on the record, was this a statement that we're about to hear that would have been made on the national news or anything like that?

A.   No.  This was an interview he did with a reporter, a British reporter.

So it was filmed.  And so these are statements that, at least in 1976, didn't get publicized, but they were, you know, an interview with senior executives.  I think there's one from Dr. Wakeham.  They also interviewed Jim Bowling at the same time.

And so they're informative because they tell you the opinion of the company to somebody who's asking them some questions about smoking and health.

Q.   And before I -- we play the clip -- well, I'll ask you afterward.  Let's go ahead.  This is Clip 1739-B.

As I've said all along, there are -- simply there are plenty ways to make a living.  I happen to believe in what I'm doing very strongly, but also I'm first of all a human being, and I certainly wouldn't -- if I thought that were so, I would not smoke myself nor permit my wife to smoke nor my children to smoke.

MR. BOWLING:  I certainly wouldn't be in the business if I thought cigarettes were harmful to people, and I think it's important there be a lot of us around who are trying to keep the research honest and open.  I think the real dishonesty is telling people things that are not so.

controversy was manufactured by the cigarette industry through -- and perpetrated to the public through the Tobacco Institute.

Q.   And was public health -- the public health community, including the Surgeon General, trying to get that message out during this time?

A.   Yes, they were.

Q.   And if we look back at the Frank Statement, we saw a commitment from the industry back in '53 that they would cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health.

Did the Tobacco Institute speak directly in response over time to the public health community's statements, Surgeon General's statements on the issue of smoking and health?

A.   Yes.  As the reports started to come out every year implicating, with more evidence accumulating, they put out statements basically attacking the Surgeon General and -- and the findings of their reports.

THE COURT:  We can do it before or after. Whichever you choose.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, this is just a series --this may be a good time, in fact, because we're about to look at two or three of these.

THE COURT:  Okay.

Ladies and gentlemen, let's take our morning recess.  20 minutes.  Thank you.

(The jury left the courtroom at 10:21 a.m.)

THE COURT:  The record should reflect the jury is out of the courtroom.

Is there anything we need to address?

MR. SCHULTZ:  No.  Only, Your Honor, that we will take the Bible deposition off of our pre-admits.  It was -- I am not blaming them.  I'm 100 percent responsible for what's on these slides, but we've all looked at them, Judge, and I just don't always think of all those issues when I'm going through this.  This was done before the pretrial conference, and I didn't go back through and catch -- it's sort of like some of the words that we went back through last night to redact.  I just wanted to be clear to the Court that I'm not acting in bad faith.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, you're disappointing

me.  I thought you were perfect.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Ask my wife.

THE COURT:  Mr. Geraghty?

MR. GERAGHTY:  No, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Good to see you guys.  I'll see you in two minutes.

(Break taken from 10:22 a.m. to 10:47 a.m.)

THE COURT: Please remain seated. The jury's not ready to come back in right now. So -- one of them needed some water.

MR. SCHULTZ:  There's one issue we might address if we have five minutes.

THE COURT:  Great.

MR. SCHULTZ:  We may not resolve it in five minutes, but the plaintiffs listed Dr. Richard Hurt as a rebuttal witness to Dr. Dorce, specifically. And having now reviewed her prior testimony and prepared for her cross and we're told that she's going to come, I presume, on Friday, it may be Thursday.  I don't know if that's been decided yet.

We have talked with Dr. Hurt.  He's available to come in on Monday, and we intend to call him as a rebuttal to Dr. Dorce, probably less than an hour of testimony.  It certainly wouldn't interfere with closings on Monday, which I think was the plan.

And it will depend on what she's going to say, but I think I have a pretty good idea of what she's going to say based on her deposition in the case and what she said in prior testimony.  And I understand defendants object because for direct Dr. Hurt was called as a generic witness.  As I said, he was disclosed as a rebuttal witness, however, so the scope of his rebuttal would be dictated by the scope of her direct examination.

That's our plan.  Now, I understand the defendants oppose it, and obviously we need to make arrangements with Dr. Hurt one way or the other if he is to come.  And -- and so we wanted to raise it with the Court so we can know what we need to do basically.

THE COURT:  Okay.  We're going to finish with Dr. Cummings today and see where we are.  And -- and it's going to dictate what's going to happen with defense's addiction expert, in terms of the timing, and then I'll hear any particular objections.

You can continue your discussions about what you think you need to do or don't need to do, based upon what you've learned regarding the witness and defendant's witness.  And, you know, at the appropriate time that I need to decide -- may be

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And in light of Your Honor's comments, I won't say much.  We have a memorandum that we're happy to file, and we can hand that up now if Your Honor wants that.  Mr. Carpenter --

THE COURT:  On what issue?

MR. GERAGHTY:  On the issue that he told us about this rebuttal witness.

THE COURT:  Okay.  You're still �

MR. GERAGHTY: Or we can wait until the end of the day if Your Honor prefers. We can just hand it to you.

THE COURT:  Yeah, you can hand it to me any time, and that's fine.  Obviously I'm trying to pay attention to what the witness is saying up here, so I probably won't be reading it.  Okay?  Thank you.

THE COURT:  You may.  Thank you so much.

And we had up LP0719.  Can you tell the jury what this document is?

A. This is basically a press release put out by the Tobacco Institute in response to the 1968 Surgeon General's Report.

Q.   And the TI indicates, "The report is a shockingly intemperate defamation of an industry which has led the way in medical research to seek answers in the cigarette controversy.  It overlooks completely the fact that the industry pioneered and organized the scientific study of the question when it established the Council for Tobacco Research USA in 1954, long before any other public or private agency even attempted to provide anything but statistics and speculations." Would this have been accompanied by other public statements of the same sort outside of the press release?

A.   Yes.  They would have their white papers, which were usually supplied.  If anybody contacted them for information, that's what you would receive.

Q.   And as we move forward in time, Dr. Cummings, to the 1972 report, do we see a similar response from the Tobacco Institute?

A.   Well, the response is similar, but I would say more intense in tone as time goes on; and as additional

reports come out, they become more critical of the reports from the Surgeon General's office.

Q.   And by this time, Mr. Danielson would be 20 --21 years old, in that area?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And they indicate, "The '72 report of the Surgeon General insults the scientific community and the No. 1 health problem is not cigarette smoking, but the extent to which public health officials may knowingly mislead the American public."

Was the Surgeon General's Report -- describe for the jury, if you would, the 1972 Surgeon General's Report just in terms of the -- the general thrust of the content.

What was the Surgeon General trying to communicate to the U.S.?

A.   Well, the reports were a summary of the scientific evidence on smoking and health and the diseases that are linked to cigarette smoking.  And there was more -- they would just basically update the literature that was originally in the '64 report.

So there was many more studies coming out year after year.  Cigarettes are the most studied risk factor in medical history.

And, you know, in '72, there was additional --

I think the stuff on the low birth weight of infants and the effects of secondhand smoke were actually mentioned in the '72 report, and so these were the times that have -- these are peer-reviewed, you know, documents. MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is now nonresponsive to the question.

THE COURT:  It just went a little long beyond the direct.

MR. SCHULTZ:  LP225, for the record. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   We move up seven years to 1979.

Would Mr. Danielson be in his late 20s at this point?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And we have a memo from Fred Panzer to William Kloepfer, subject:  PR department reports Surgeon General's Report activities.

Are these gentlemen with the Tobacco Institute? A.   Yes.  Yes.

Q.   That evening TI's news conference was the lead news story on all national television networks the next morning before the HEW news conference. What is HEW? A.   Health, Education and Welfare. Q.   Does that refer to the Surgeon General?

A. At the time that's where the Surgeon General's office was housed.

Q.   Before the HEW news conference, Mr. Kornegay's Today interview was broadcast by NBC. And who was Mr. Kornegay?

A. He was the president of the Tobacco Institute. And they're talking about Mr. Califano, who at the time was the secretary of Health, Education and Welfare.

Q.   And we see references to the Today show to lead news story on all national television networks.

When the TI spoke on these issues, particularly in this example in 1979, did it get a lot of press coverage for its view on this issue?

A.   Yes, it got a tremendous amount of press coverage.  They did a preemptive news conference.  The report came out I believe on January 11th of 1979. They, on January 10th, held a preemptive press event at the Mayflower Hotel.

It got a lot of coverage for that; and, of course, there were discussions that this is really talking about media after the report had been issued and their appearances on national news media.

Q.   That was LP0174.

If we go forward to 1988, LP1588, what was the subject matter of the 1988 Surgeon General's Report?

A.   Nicotine addiction.

Q.   And did the Tobacco Institute, again, respond to this report like the others?

A.   Yes.  When the report came out, they had a --you know, a press release basically, you know, claiming that the report was -- you know, claiming that cigarettes are addictive and it contradicts common sense and it trivialized the serious nature of addiction and addictive substances.  That was the response from the industry.

And then when they were interviewed on national media, their spokesperson said that cigarettes are not addictive; that it would be inappropriate to suggest that.

Q. And if we go back to 1980, keeping on the same subject for a moment, this is Mr. Kornegay we see up in the corner of the speech.

Remind the jury who he was.

A.   He was the president of the Tobacco Institute at that time, and he's, you know, giving a recount of the prior years' successes.

Q.   Does this refer, in fact, to the news conference you just talked about at the Mayflower Hotel when he says the Surgeon General's media event was preempted by an institute first-strike news conference?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Indicating they got top billing that night on all the networks?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And down below Mr. Kornegay talks about, "Communications have been on the uptrend this year.  Our four speakers covered a quarter of a million miles, logging nearly 800 appearances, including 300 hours on the air.

"The TI's publications unit turned out a dozen new publications, distributed about a quarter million copies of those.  Tobacco Observer reached a circulation of 86,000, and their films have been seen by about 750,000 people this year for a cumulative audience of three and a half million."

Now, these references to speakers logging miles and making appearances, the films and so forth, are these among the materials that were turned over to you by the New York attorney general from the Tobacco Institute?

A.   Yes.  So had all their films.  They did a number of films that they would have and distribute to schools.  I call them the animal clubs, like the Moose club, you know, Kiwanis and so on.  And they would have -- you know, giving their position and then they

had their public relations specialists.  These were all public relations people who they hired and went around and appeared on national and local news all over the country.

And the Tobacco Observer is the tobacco and health newsletter that I think I talked about later. They renamed it the Tobacco Observer.  That was the, you know, monthly report that they put out challenging --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is beyond the scope of the question at this point.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I would overrule that objection.

But do draw it to a close. A.   Sure.  I was just going to point out that is the same newsletter; they just renamed it. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And the four speakers who covered a quarter of a million miles, the slide indicates the Truth Squad.

Where does that term come from? A.   Well, that was their term.  So in the late 1960s they named themselves the Truth Squad because these PR people went all over the country giving the Tobacco Institute's message, and this is just a summary of some of the appearances that, you know, these public relations specialists had.

Connie Drath were among them.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, based on your education and training in -- in communication, in health communication particularly, even if somebody didn't see a particular one of these shows, was this part of an effort -- a successful effort to keep the tobacco message as part of the national conversation, if you will?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object.

That's invading the province of the jury and calls

for speculation.

THE COURT:  I would overrule the objection.

Thank you.

A.   Yes, it was.  It was a way of keeping the controversy alive that cigarette smoking hadn't been proven to be a cause of lung cancer and other diseases. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And we see appearances -- you made a reference to a few of them -- Good Morning America, Tomorrow, the Today Show, MacNeil/Lehrer, Crossfire, CBS News with Walter Cronkite.

Did they manage to keep this message at the sort of top level of the media, if you will, over these years?

A.   Sure.  I mean, hitting the national news shows obviously reach a bigger audience, but they also did

local shows and appeared on local television all over Florida, for example, and New York.

When I was at Roswell I had some of these people appear when I was on the local news being the health representative.  And it was an unfair fight; these were public relations specialists.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object and move to strike.

THE COURT:  I would sustain that -- it went beyond the question that was asked, the last --MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm sorry.

THE COURT: He moved to strike it and I will strike the very last response of it was an unfair fight; they were public relations professionals.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you.  I'm sorry for interrupting, Judge. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Let me ask that question particularly:  Did these people, the Truth Squad, Bill Dwyer, Walker Merryman, Connie Drath, and the others that you mentioned, is there evidence in the record that they did receive media training?

A.   Yes.  And they gave media training as well.  So they ran the College of Knowledge, which was an annual event for executives of the cigarette companies.

So these public relations -- I know they're

public relation specialists because I know their

backgrounds, and I met and talked with some of them.

They weren't scientists.  But they did training

for others, this College of Knowledge, which was a --

something that the executives who came to the companies

was quite honored to be selected to go get the annual

trainings that they did.

Q.   And if they got that training, Dr. Cummings,

from the people, the Truth Squad, these media

specialists, would the -- the -- the tobacco executives

who attended that College of Knowledge then go out and

use those skills to spread the same message?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   Now, we have a clip from 20/20 in 1983.

Would this be an example, Dr. Cummings, of a

Truth Squad appearance on a national network television

program?

A.   Yes.  I believe this one is Anne Browder and

she was one of the Truth Squad members and long-term

public relations specialist for the Tobacco Institute.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we play that, please, Ryan?

MALE SPEAKER:  Hugh Downs, this is 20/20.

[MUSIC]

MALE SPEAKER:  The growing evidence that these products were killing people eventually led to their ban from broadcasting.  The tobacco companies, however, still claim the health hazards haven't been proven.  We asked Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, and Lorillard to appear on this program.  None would.

They told us to talk to the Tobacco Institute. The institute said Anne Browder would speak for them.

FEMALE SPEAKER:  The case is still open.  The jury has not come in.

MALE SPEAKER:  It may not be harmful?  You're not convinced?

FEMALE SPEAKER:  It may be or it may not be.

We don't know.

Q. As we move into the 1980s, is there a shift in the tone of the message, if you will, coming out of the Tobacco Institute in terms of the controversy?

A.   Well, they stay on the message in the sense it's still a controversy, but they begin to say, well, it may be or it may not be, it may be a risk factor, but not necessarily causal.  So essentially it's basically the same message of doubt and controversy and unproven and more research is needed.

Q.   And we have one other very brief clip.

Can you tell the jury who Ed Horrigan was, in 1982 that is?

A.   Sure.  He was vice president for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  And he also served on the executive committee of the TI and also with CTR.

He appeared in front of Congressional hearing and talked about the funding of research through the Council for Tobacco Research.

Q.   And who's sitting next to him?

A.   That's Mr. Kornegay from -- Horace Kornegay from the Tobacco Institute.  He's the president of the Tobacco Institute.

MALE SPEAKER:  You're telling us that there is no link; is that correct?

MALE SPEAKER:  I am saying that the science to

date and over $100 billion in our industry indicates

that there is no causal link.  That is what I am

advised; and I am not a scientist, Mr. Waxman, and

that is why doctors asked or scientists asked to

participate here this morning to perhaps answer in

greater depths the questions that you raised.

BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Now, he mentioned a causal link.  What causal link are they talking about?

A.   About cigarette smoking and lung cancer.

Q.   And this would have been, Dr. Cummings, how many years after the 1958 trip from the British American Tobacco scientist where they learn the industry believed in the link?

A.   Well, you're now talking, you know, 22, 24 years, something like that, so...

Q.   And does he also claim in this hearing there is absolutely no proof that cigarettes are addictive?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was that part of the industry message --particularly going into the '70s and '80s as well --denying not only the health effects but the addictiveness of smoking?

A.   They were asked to comment on the addictiveness.  They denied that it was -- their products were addictive.  Mostly that public statements began to come out after the Surgeon General's Report in 1988.  But there are reports that they were asked at various times about addiction, because this was coming up as a topic, particularly among scientists and the national institutes on drug abuse right around this time, actually.

Q.   And as we go forward into the '80s, do we still see white papers and are they still -- let me just ask about that paper -- that question, first of all.

A.   Sure.  The white papers came out every year, and some of them were more expansive.  The '79 one was fairly expansive because that was a pretty big report from the Surgeon General.  So they sort of matched it.

The '84 report is a compilation.  It's a pretty big one as well.  It's on cancer, because the Surgeon General's Report on the -- on cancer came out right around this time.

It was the first report from then Surgeon

And so this was the last of the white papers they did, and then you see the companies doing their own public relations separately.

Q.   And that is LP2306, for the record.

Now, in addition to the statements that we've seen in media and -- and the other evidence you've talked to the jury about, with respect to Philip Morris specifically, is there evidence that they undertook efforts that would affect the ability of people to quit smoking?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object to the form of that question.

THE COURT:  Please approach.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

THE COURT:  What is your objection, please? MR. GERAGHTY:  Well � THE COURT:  Go ahead.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay.  Your Honor, there is � I think where we're getting next is there's a couple of documents that Mr. Schultz wants to show Dr. Cummings that described a business dispute between Philip Morris and the Dow Chemical Company. Dow Chemical made Nicorette Gum and marketed

Nicorette Gum.  At the same time that's happening, the Dow Chemical Company is also a supplier of certain ingredients and products to Philip Morris that are used in the --

THE COURT:  (Inaudible) there you go.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I have one of those.  So...

THE COURT:  Uh-huh.

MR. GERAGHTY:  But so what these documents reflect is that there's a business dispute between Philip Morris and Dow Chemical, and the documents describe the business dispute.

This question -- this is one of those instances where I think Mr. Schultz should be required to adhere to the documents and not ask the sweeping question, "Did Philip Morris do things to try to prevent people from quitting smoking," because that's not what the documents say.

What the documents say is that Philip Morris didn't like the -- the tone of some of the literature that Dow had used to market the product. They had discussions with them where they said, "Hey, you know, please tone that down.  You know, we're paying you money to buy your ingredients and everything, and you're saying all these things about our product."

So that's what it's all about.

But there -- there isn't any reference specifically in any of the documents that they were trying to prevent people from quitting smoking as part of this decision with Dow Chemical.  That's --that's the problem.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

MR. SCHULTZ:  We had a motion in limine that was denied.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Documents come in.  I agree.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Correct.

Dr. Cummings -- the evidence, Judge, will be Dr. Cummings's explanation of what happened between the two companies, and I didn't choose to show six or seven documents and every communication between them.  The short version is Philip Morris didn't like Dow Chemical, but now Nicorette Gum?  They didn't like Dow Chemical suggesting that smoking was addictive, so they strong-armed them and said, "We're not buying any more humectants from you." And they were a huge supplier.  The documents will bear that out.

And it is meant to interfere with the -- the distribution of a smoking cessation aid.

If you want me to phrase the question that way,

Veritext Legal Solutions 212-279-9424                                     www.veritext.com                                    212-490-3430

I'm happy to phrase the question that way.  I think the fair inference is that -- that would fear with people's ability to quit smoking.

THE COURT:  They undertook efforts that would affect the ability of people to quit smoking.  Is that how you worded your question?

(Perusing realtime.)

And you say that's not an appropriate question?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I agree, yes, Your Honor.

The two claims are a concealment of information about the health risks and addictive nature of smoking and agreement to conceal.

It's outside the scope of --

THE COURT:  I think � I think that the � the discussion about what efforts that Mr. Danielson personally engaged in is certainly an issue before the jury.  And concealment about health effects of smoking and addiction are before the jury, and within the context of that are addiction alternatives such as patches or gum or whatever the case may be.

So I think certainly the subject matter is well within around the area of relevance and materiality.

Again, I'm trying to keep a line drawn pretty clearly that he can introduce these documents and

then -- to the extent that they say what they mean, he clearly can -- can point that out.

But drawing -- you know, interpreting them as he thinks -- what he thinks they mean is the place that we got to a little bit of trouble.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.  I'm going to ask him (inaudible) --

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'll start off --

THE COURT:  Yeah.  So certainly the subject matter is a perfectly acceptable subject matter.

And introduction of documents which would reveal that there is -- is -- is something that Philip Morris is doing that is interfering with the production of addiction alternatives is perfectly permissible.

And for the record, this is LP1030. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, in the mid-1980s -- we're in 1984 on this particular document -- did Dow Chemical and Philip Morris have a business relationship together?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   And what was the nature of that relationship?

A.   Philip Morris purchased different kinds of chemicals used in processing tobacco -- propylene glycol, glycerin -- which are used to reduce irritation, making it easier to inhale smoke.  It also keeps tobacco moist.

Q.   And at some point, did -- in the early 1980s, did Dow Chemical become involved with the potential sale of Nicorette Gum?

A.   Yeah.  Marion Merrell Dow, which was a -- you know, part of Dow Chemical, basically was the distributor for nicotine gum.  Nicotine gum was approved as a stop-smoking medication by the Food and Drug Administration as a prescription product in 1984 in the United States.

And so they were involved in the marketing of Nicorette Gum when it, you know, came out.  They were --they were the company selling it in the United States.

Q.   And does this letter from Philip Morris --interoff- -- interoffice letter from Philip Morris indicate Philip Morris's position or issues that it had with Merrell Dow and its involvement with Nicorette Gum?

A.   Yeah.  It's recounting, actually, a series of correspondence back and forth that actually go back a

number of years.  As the Nicorette was coming to market here in the United States, it was already available over in Europe, and Philip Morris was tracking it.

And here, you know, Dow is told that they --that they, that Philip Morris was discontinuing all its humectant purchases -- that's the, you know, propylene glycol and the -- and the glycerin purchases -- because of Dow's attack on cigarette smoking associated with the introduction of Nicorette, the nicotine-containing prescription chewing gum which report -- reportedly aids patients in quitting smoking.

And some of the objectionable things that were noted included efforts to encourage all smokers at one of the Dow plants to give up cigarettes.  That was actually done as part of the Great American Smokeout. They had a program where they provided the employees with Nicorette.

And Dow sponsored a policy analysis indicating that an additional $59,000 lifetime medical care expenses -- expenses for smokers; that Dow literature appearing in doctors' offices encouraging smokers to quit by using Nicorette; and also, you know, doctors' clinics were given, you know, samples of Nicorette and, you know, used that to encourage people to come to the doctor to quit smoking.

And there was a newsletter that was copublished by the National Cancer Institute sent to primary care doctors.  Actually, Dow suspended that in response to Philip Morris's concerns after only one edition; so that was -- that was ended.

Anyway, Dow has, you know -- through this correspondence it, you know, was clearly upset with the way that Dow was marketing Nicorette, and -- even though they acknowledge that they withdrew the smoking cessation newsletter it's indicated.  And they basically were saying, "We're cutting off -- we're not buying our chemicals from you anymore."

Q.   And did this correspondence that's back and forth between Philip Morris and Dow -- did go on over a period of time?

A. Yes. And continues after this, because they reinstated the purchasing actually a few months later, and they said, "Well, there are only two suppliers of these chemicals. And, actually, if we cut out one of the suppliers, that probably is going to increase our cost.

And, secondly, they said, "We probably have greater influence on the marketing of Nicorette by having Dow as a partner."  And so -- and, in fact, they did oversee and Dow basically caved a bit and provided

examples of their advertising of Nicorette to Philip Morris.  And so it was tamped down in terms of the marketing.

Q.   And is that how it was eventually resolved between Philip Morris and Dow?

A.   Yeah.  The -- as I said, the -- the humectant purchases were reinstated, I think, in early 1985.

Q.   I want to --

A.   And then eventually Dow sold off the rights to selling Nicorette to a different company.

Q.   I want to shift years kind of into the home stretch, Dr. Cummings, and talk a bit about nicotine addiction.  And I want to start with this document, which is LP1546, at Page 3.

Can you remind the jury who Myron Johnston at Philip Morris was?

A.   Oh, he was in their R&D department.  He was one of the forecasters that they used.  His basic training was in demography, but he did a lot of the forecasting of where the market was going.  I think I -- we showed yesterday a Myron Johnston document talking about sales of Marlboros among young boys, 15- to 17-year-olds.

Here in 1966, he is summarizing the results of a major marketing study that Philip Morris had done on the, you know, potential of a health cigarette.

And he comments (indicating) in the piece that he writes that a cigarette that does not deliver nicotine cannot satisfy the habituated smoker and cannot lead to habituation and would, therefore, almost certainly fail.

Q.   And are there other documents, internal -- that was 1966.  Mr. Danielson would have been -- turned 13 that year?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Are there other documents that are consistent with this within Philip Morris, including this document from Dr. Wakeham in 1969?

A.   Yes.  You know, this is the board of directors presentation.  You know, the smoker, although aware of his response to smoke, is unable to report accurately the nature of this response.  He points out that, you know, we share the conviction with others that it is the pharmacologic effect of inhaled smoke which mediates the smoking habit and that the motivation for smoking is to obtain the pharmacologic effect of nicotine. So nicotine is the key ingredient.

Q.   And I want to come back to your opinions from yesterday.  He says, "The primary motivation for smoking is to attain the pharmacological effect of nicotine." Does that mean that it's necessarily, in your

opinion, to the exclusion of other reasons for smoking, like enjoyment, stress relief, and things of that nature?

A.   No.  That's not to the exclusion of other things.  I mean, people like handling a cigarette.  They like seeing the smoke come off the end.

But the primary driver of smoking and the effects on stress release and enjoyment is the delivery of nicotine to the brain.

Q.   And if we move up to 1978, we have a document to the file from Dr. -- or Mr. Tom Osdene pertaining to a CTR meeting in New York City January of 1978. Are you familiar with this document?

A.   Yes.  This is related to that document I think we showed yesterday that talked about the lawyer who had recommended -- you know, the concern over funding research on nicotine antagonists.  And this is --they're talking about Dr. Abood's research.  And Dr. Seligman -- Seligman actually brought up the grant that Dr. Abood had, you know, which, if you actually develop and is a successful blocker of nicotine in the brain --

Q.   Well, let me ask you before you describe the --the meeting.

It says at "Mr. Goldsmith's request."  Is he

the head of Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Dr. Seligman.  Mr. Holtzman -- is that Alex Holtzman, who we saw is an attorney for Philip Morris?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And they met with Dr. Garner, Dr. Hockett and Mr. Hoyt.

Is Dr. Garner with the CTR?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And Mr. Hoyt is with?

A.   Hockett and Hoyt were both -- they're all with CTR.

Q.   All with CTR?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   "...met at CTR offices in New York."

It indicates Dr. Seligman brought up the grant by Dr. Abood, which you just described, in which "one of the stated aims was to make a clinically acceptable antagonist to nicotine.  This goal would have the potential of putting the tobacco manufacturers out of business."

And I think you were about to allude to it, Dr. Cummings:  What is the effect of a nicotine antagonist, and what effect would that have on an addicted smoker?

A.   Well, if you could block the effect of nicotine in the brain so it doesn't release those neurotransmitters, you basically don't get the reward and you don't get the benefit of nicotine and it would eliminate addiction.

Q.   And if we look -- and that was LP 0072.

And if we go forward and talk about addiction, is it something -- and I think these speak for themselves.

Dr. Cummings, is it something that Philip Morris recognized internally for a long time from a very early date that addiction and nicotine are reasons for people smoking?

A.   Sure.  A lot of people smoke.  That was, you know, Mr. Geiger's analysis, and he identified physiological reasons as well as psychological.  Under physiological addiction was one of the factors.  Helmut Wakeham in 1959 also talks about nicotine being the main reason that people smoke.  And then, again, in 1969 he does it to the board of directors and then, again, in 1974.

So in the Research and Development, you know, Department of Philip Morris they knew why people smoked: They smoked for nicotine.

Q.   And if we go forward in time as Mr. Danielson

is aging -- this is 1974 and 1975 -- we see more of the same from within:  Formerly secret business documents of Philip Morris?

A.   Yeah.  You find these kinds of statements in --you know, it's a big part of R&D at Philip Morris. They're, you know, doing research on the important --you know, the delivery of nicotine; the way you deliver it, you know, through inhalation, through injection, or, you know, through other means; the mode makes a difference, how you deliver it.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is beyond the

scope of the question.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.  Thank

you. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And if we look at the last document, is that one of the things you were referring to there, where we have -- let me ask you, first of all:  Is this out of R&D at Philip Morris --

A.   Yes, it is.

A.   Correct.

Is that what you were referring to, this idea of delivering an optimal amount of nicotine to smokers?

A.   Yeah, optimal for sales.  And they were very concerned about how low you go, because you don't want to go below the threshold level, because if you go below that, then people can freely walk away, and most smokers would quit if they could --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would move to

Q.   Was this acknowledgment, Dr. Cummings, about the importance of nicotine and addiction to smoking into the business, was that limited to Philip Morris or was it shared by other companies in which they engaged in this conspiracy?

A.   It was shared by the other companies, and these are just examples of -- from Reynolds and Brown & Williamson, Lorillard.  They knew nicotine was the key ingredient in their products, and they studied it extensively through their research and development efforts.

Q.   And was it ever communicated publicly during Lamar Danielson's lifetime, from Philip Morris or from

any of these companies, for example, people smoke to maintain nicotine levels?

A.   No.

Q.   Or we are basically in the nicotine business?

A.   No.

Q. We've got a document, LP 0059. The document is entitled, "Manipulation of Nicotine Delivery by Addition of Acids to Filter," out of Philip Morris USA's research center.

Again, I want to look just briefly, Dr. Cummings, on this particular document are the names at the bottom people who were higher-ups within R&D and elsewhere, Dr. Wakeham, Mr. Resnik, Mr. Osdene, Paul Icorn.

Are these higher-ups within Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And did Philip Morris spend a lot of time and money studying nicotine and smoking behaviors specifically?

A.   Yes.  That was a main part of their research program that was led by Dr. William Dunn.  I think we saw some of the documents in the basic model of operant conditioning that they used to drive their research.

Q.   And if we look at LP 0080, an excerpt we have up on the screen, in 1980 Mr. Danielson would be 27 or

Q. To Dr. Seligman -- whose name we've heard many times -- from Mr. Osdene, "Evaluation of Major Research and Development Programs."

Was the nicotine program a nicotine program at Philip Morris, one of the major programs in the business?

A.   Yes.  This is listing priority areas of research in R&D in 1980 and Tom Osdene has now become the director of research at Philip Morris, and he's listing to his boss and the directors of the company that, you know, what are the research priorities, and the nicotine program was identified as one of those

priorities because the thing they sell most is nicotine.

Q.   And if we go back in time, Dr. Cummings, back into the 1960s, when Mr. Danielson was just, perhaps, experimenting with cigarettes, do we still see research and R&D efforts and money being poured into the study of nicotine in Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.  They were very -- you know, they looked at nicotine delivery, which can be affected by various additives that were put in filler.  So this is the man-made reconstituted tobacco, and -- which was used in Marlboro cigarettes.  And they would add various additives that would affect the pH, and so acids would be one of the things that could affect it, as well as things that would be more basic, like ammonia carbonate and diammonium phosphate.  These were chemicals that were utilized in the manufacture of Marlboro cigarettes.

Q.   Based on these documents and this work that you've reviewed, Dr. Cummings, was there at least a working theory within Philip Morris R&D that manipulating pH of smoke could affect the speed with which nicotine gets to a smoker's brain?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object and

move to -- or request to approach at this point. THE COURT:  You may. (The following proceedings were held outside of

the hearing of the jury.)

MR. GERAGHTY:  We're sort of right at that point now, Your Honor, where I'm concerned that he's going to cross into areas where I believe Your Honor has ruled he's not allowed to go.  Number one, for him to say that it actually did affect the speed or the delivery or the addictiveness, I know Your Honor's has ruled in that way in O'Hara, and we've agreed that will apply here.

This question, I think, he needs to show a document, and he needs to let the document speak for itself because, again, it's just like the issue we talked about earlier, where the question was, you know, what -- what is the significance of these statements to you?

I think this is the same sort of type of question.  I think it's an inappropriate question. If he has a document where he believes that someone from Philip Morris actually said that, then we need to see the document and let the document speak for itself.

I will point out that -- I can't remember if it was Mr. Schultz in his questioning -- I think it was Mr. Schultz in his questioning when he started this area -- when we started talking about nicotine and

research on nicotine, he said many of these documents speak for themselves.  That was what he said five or seven minutes ago when we got into this area.

I think this is highly prejudicial for him to throw this theory out there.  If -- if they want to say that it's a theory that someone at Philip Morris espoused or adopted, then I think we need to see a document, otherwise it's inherently prejudicial and unfair for Dr. Cummings to say that's the inference that he personally has drawn from reading these documents.  So that's my objection.

THE COURT:  I've seen the documents that say they were working on those and some suggestion that provided this quicker delivery to the brain in a more potent effect.  But my understanding is that everyone has agreed -- cigarette manufacturers and independent scientists have agreed that it's not --the theory didn't turn out to be true.  And I think his point is that they were looking into this as something and that didn't turn out to work that way.

So their intent, their motive that the mindset with which they approached their concern for the consumer.

rulings were they can show that if they've got the document, that they've got the evidence, they can show that this is what they were trying to do, this is what they thought they were doing, but there had to be made clear at some point in the discussion that it turned out not to be true.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, one point of clarification:  There's plenty of evidence that it did work with Farone.  It has -- we talked about studies, but it did work.  There's a dispute as of 2015 science whether it actually works, and if so how and why.  That's beside the point.  It was not the purpose.  You've articulated the purpose for it accurately.

If we wanted -- if all we could do was sit the jury down and hand them a bunch of documents and say "Read the Documents" we wouldn't need Dr. Cummings. I have a good-faith basis for the question.  I'm trying to shortcut this, and ask -- adhere very closely to the line that you drew, which is:  Was it a theory?  And that's all.  We all understand the relevance of that.

I have a good-faith basis.  He's seen it.  He's published on this.  He shouldn't have to throw a document in front of the jury just to answer, "Yes,

they did."  If they want to cross-examine him, that's really -- how do you know they want to cross-examine him?  I don't have a document to show the jury.  I could dig through a box and find one, but all of a sudden they're going to ask the question.

He's an expert on this.  That's his opinion based on his review of the evidence.  If they don't think it's true, I'd love to hear their cross-examination on it.

THE COURT:  So you're -- your position is that you're -- you're not going to introduce the document, but you're going to elicit from this witness that he has independently studied as a part of his -- of his credentialing, and that he's independently studied whether or not the control of pH in the cigarette increases the speed at which it's -- taken in by the brain, and if they -- there were studies done by cigarette manufacturers, including Philip Morris, to see if they can manipulate the pH level to create that effect, free-basing effect.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes.

free-basing.  But, I mean, I'm asking the question you just heard, Judge.  We just showed him a document that pH affects nicotine delivery.  They're interested in that.

My question is -- went further, and that is the question you've heard, and that is the only question I intend to ask.  If they cross on it, then we can show documents on redirect.

THE COURT:  Okay.  There would have to be clarification that it has not been determined that these efforts -- my understanding is -- and this was stipulated by all parties --

MR. SCHULTZ:  That was not stipulated by us.

THE COURT:  It was stipulated -- I said it was stipulated by all the parties in the last trial. They didn't have -- that it never -- it was concluded that it did not have the desired effect that, therefore, they stopped that research or concluded the research.  And they -- they didn't do that because they assumed some fact didn't work.

Now, I don't know where you're going with it, but do you have something that says that this fellow here is going to testify that in his opinion it did work, and would --

MR. SCHULTZ:  No, my question is --

THE COURT:  If his conclusion is that it, in fact, didn't work, he -- that's got to come with the rest of his testimony.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's not -- I'm not going to ask him that because we have a ruling that says we're not going to get past it with a hypotheses.

If I asked him, Judge, by the way, did this work?  He's going to say yes.  And it does.  It's not -- there's no -- it's a whole other debate and it's not resolved.

Bill Farone is an expert in this case.  He'll come in here and tell you exactly -- and he did in the deposition I took of him that we're not playing. But that's not where I'm going, Judge.

I'm asking him did they have a theory.  An in limine order that I believe we agreed to in this case was we're going to (inaudible) about whether it's a hypotheses.  You're not to go into whether it worked.  If they want to ask him on

cross-examination whether it worked, I'll guarantee you they will say yes.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's not where I'm going.

THE COURT:  Thank you .

MR. GERAGHTY:  And it was granted by agreement of the plaintiff that they would not introduce evidence that this hypotheses that the use of ammonia compounds increases the speed or the delivery of nicotine.  They agreed they would not do that.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Specifically let me read it into the record.  The motion is granted by agreement as plaintiff will not introduce evidence and testimony that the hypotheses that ammonia compounds in cigarettes leads smokers to absorb nicotine more quickly; and, therefore, makes cigarettes more addictive is true.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's right.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Right.  And so what he wants to do to get around that, despite his agreement and stipulation in that motion, is he wants, Judge, Dr. Cummings to just say, well, did they think that that worked?  That necessarily is asking Dr. Cummings to comment on the intent or the state of mind of Philip Morris generally or individual employees of Philip Morris.

What Your Honor has also said he's not allowed to do in the absence of a document that simply says,

well, here's what we intended to do.  And

Mr. Schultz has told you he doesn't have those

documents.

As a matter of fact, the document that he just flashed on the screen -- he flashed the first page -- if you kept reading that document there are all sorts of things.  They say, well, you know, we -- we don't know what this really does.  That's what that one document that he showed says.

So I think what this really is doing, Your Honor, is an attempt to try to carve out some way around that stipulation to put a skunk --proverbial skunk in the jury box, and then I'm forced to have to cross-examine him.

And you heard what Mr. Schultz said:  You cross-examine him and he's going to say he thinks --so I'm going to have to deal with it -- that on cross, and then he's going to want to come back on redirect.

I don't want to go there.  I want to keep a lid on all this.  And I don't think he should be allowed to offer an opinion about our state of mind or our intent.  I think Your Honor ruled very squarely on that in O'Hara.  You've adhered to that here.  We've all agreed that's the rule or ruling.

THE COURT:  But I did permit in O'Hara for them to present evidence that the manufacturer did engage in research and whether or not affecting the pH level would enhance the delivery of nicotine in the smoker.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And I apologize for interrupting you.  I think that is true.  What you did was you required Mr. Smith, Rob Smith to put the R.J. Reynolds documents in front of Dr. Hurt where R.J. Reynolds's people discussed those issues; and I've told Your Honor the R.J. Reynolds documents say very different things from the Philip Morris documents.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I don't have a Philip Morris document that says it works.  Judge, the carveout is exactly what I asked.  You've read these records. You've published in this area.  Is it fair to say it was at least a working theory within Philip Morris that pH manipulation might affect the delivery of nicotine to the brain?  Absolutely.  It was a working theory at Philip Morris.  End of discussion.

We never agreed that it doesn't work.  We agreed we wouldn't produce evidence that it actually worked.  That's --

head of a pin argument may very well be lost on the jury.  Can you present evidence that they did investigate -- you're calling it that they had a working theory.  Okay?  He's certainly going to be permitted to present evidence that they researched it.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'll ask that question.

THE COURT:  Okay.  But this working theory really assumes that they believed it to be true. And then if you walk away without saying it was true, then the assumption to the jury is it must have been true that they did the research.

So with regard to the document that you have that you're talking about right now, yes, they researched it.  And my whole point in admitting that in the other trial and permitting it in this one is you can show that they were doing this research. They were trying to -- you know, research, you know, speaks for itself.

It says this is -- this is what we're doing and we're seeing if this has this effect, and we found it had this effect and we believe it had this effect.

So the documents that are admitted in the RJR case, I mean, they really were concluding that they

thought it did have an effect, okay, without us ever telling the jury in that case that it conclusively did work or conclusively did not work.

That's the area that I don't want to get in because that's an area which I was told the science is not in on, and that would simply raise another area of dispute that you guys have in terms of who is not going to be testifying.

MR. SCHULTZ:  The document that I have in hand says -- Philip Morris says it speeds delivery of nicotine to the brain.  I feel like I'm forbidden to use that document.  I'm simply going to ask the question unless I'm hearing you tell me that I can't, did they engage in research that explored the question of --

THE COURT:  Whether or not.

MR. SCHULTZ:  -- pH manipulation could affect the speed of nicotine delivery to the brain.

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well �

MR. SCHULTZ:  No.  I said --

THE COURT:  He said he has an exhibit that actually says that they did the study, and the study points to it being true.  And the being true part is exactly what the order covered, and it says you can't -- you can't communicate that conclusion to the jury.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Then my objection is, why are we putting that exhibit up so there's --

THE COURT:  Because he's going to establish that this witness has himself researched and written on this issue and he tells me he can do that.

MR. GERAGHTY:  That's irrelevant.  The question that he wants to get to, Your Honor, is did Philip Morris research and did they make statements indicating or evidencing an intent that they believed that this theory existed.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm --

THE COURT:  Don't interrupt, please.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I mean, that's where we're going here.

time that they were telling the public --

MR. GERAGHTY:  You're saying Mr. Schultz can make that inference, right, not Dr. Cummings?

THE COURT:  No.  He can elicit the testimony that this is what they were researching.  Not that they had this operative theory and that the theory was true or not true, but that they did research in this particular area to determine whether or not it enhanced the speed of the intake to the brain.

MR. GERAGHTY: I understand Your Honor's ruling. Just for the record, I'll say I think that blows this entire agreement out of the water, and I think they're running away from the stipulation. I think it's highly unfair and prejudicial and that's my objection.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.) BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, before the bench conference, we were talking about a document where Philip Morris back in the 1960s is studying nicotine and smoke pH, and I have a very simple question for you.  And I'd appreciate a simple response.

this area, I mean, the work of the tobacco companies, including Philip Morris, on studying smoke pH?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And use of ammonia in their cigarettes?

A.   That was one of the methods for controlling pH.

Q.   And my simple question to you, Dr. Cummings, is:  Did Philip Morris in its own research and development department engage in research on whether addition of ammonia or other manipulation of pH in its cigarettes would speed -- could speed the delivery of nicotine to a smoker's brain?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object for reasons

previously stated.

THE COURT:  The objection is overruled. You may answer the question.

A.   Yes. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Thank you.  If we move forward, Dr. Cummings, to LP2410.  We're now up to 1980.

Can you describe briefly, if you would for the jury, the nicotine -- are you familiar with the nicotine receptor program referred to in this document?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And can you briefly describe that program for the jury?

A.   Well, this was the research, again, Dr. Abood was doing on nicotine receptors in the brain.  Dr. Abood was a psychophysiologist at the University of Rochester who did subcontract work.  He also got money from CTR, as I mentioned earlier, where he was looking at the effects of nicotine in the brain and developing vapor agents that block that effect.

And so it was certainly discussed in terms of this area and -- because it was -- you know, Dr. Abood is doing this research.  And also at the time Philip Morris was doing analogue -- nicotine analogue research, which they're talking about in this document, which are alternative compounds to give you the same effect of nicotine but not nicotine.

So that way we're looking at various agents analogue to nicotine.

Q.   It indicates all three of those efforts that you just described are aimed at understanding the specific action of nicotine which causes the smoker to repeatedly introduce nicotine into his body, and they suggest that they're going to be permitted to continue this program to study the drug nicotine but they must not be visible about it; and they refer to it elsewhere as a clandestine effort.

any indication to anybody -- and by anybody, including him, of course -- that Philip Morris was doing this kind of nicotine work in its labs?

A.   No.

Q.   And is this also in the same time frame that if anybody asks Philip Morris or the tobacco industry or Tobacco Institute is smoking addictive, they would deny the effectiveness of smoking?

A.   Yes.  For the most part they didn't say that publicly because they were never asked about it publicly.  Really, that comes a little bit later, after 1988.  But in 1988 and after they certainly say they don't manipulate nicotine in their products, they don't control the nicotine in their products, and nicotine is not addictive.

Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, is this -- LP0058 is entitled Behavioral Research Annual Report written by Mr. Dunn.

And remind the jury just very briefly who was Bill Dunn.

A.   He was the head of the -- you know, the behavioral research program at Philip Morris.  So they did a lot of research of nicotine and the effects of nicotine on human smoking behavior.

Q.   And this is 1973, '74 to Mr. Osdene, who you've

already indicated was a higher-up in R&D?

A.   He was one of the senior people in R&D.  Of course, Helmut Wakeham was there and he's on the distribution list and he was in charge of R&D.

Q.   And in this document -- have you seen this document yourself before, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Sure.  There are many like this.  They are annual reports that are put out on the various research programs that Philip Morris had inside the company, and you see these reports up there -- there are a number --every year, basically, you see a summary of what research they're proposing, as well as what research they've done and various discussions about the implications of that research for how it can be exploited to help them sell more cigarettes.

Q.   And this particular exhibit, LP0058, which I'm holding, is 26 pages long.

A.   Correct.

Q.   Would these reports typically be fairly comprehensive reports on the kind of work R&D is doing on psychology of smoking nicotine and so forth?

A.   Yeah, they were summaries.  To be honest, 24 pages sound like a lot of pages, but it's just showing you the extent to which there was research going on in this area.

But you actually could find the individual research reports in some instances, not all, because not everything has been available.  But generally, you can find the reports they talk about in their R&D summaries annually.

Q.   And have you seen any suggestion in this document or any other report, Dr. Cummings, that Philip Morris is doing all of this work on encephalographic tests, puffing behavior, patterns of smoke inhalation, whether hyperactive children are prospective smokers, have you seen any suggestion that any work done in their labs was done to reduce the addictiveness of the products they sold?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object to relevance and 403.

THE COURT:  I would overrule the objection. You may answer the question. A.   No. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

document.

Are you familiar with this document? A.   Yes.  This is, again, another example of the plans for the next year, and Dr. Dunn is writing to his boss, Tom Osdene, that this is what we're proposing to do, why we're proposing to do it; and it's outlining the nature of the studies.

And he goes into some detail to talk about the animal studies that they're doing, the animal self-administration of nicotine, their brain wave studies, these encephalography studies that they've done.

He talks about mode of nicotine administration, injection, inhalation versus ingestion of nicotine to see what the effects there are.

There's studies on threshold levels, how low can you go and what the effect of that would be on smoking behavior.

Q.   And we've pulled up the document, Dr. Cummings.

If we look down in the paragraph below what was on the slide, we see they have three lines of investigation, including the effects of nicotine and nicotine-like compounds on animal behavior.

Is that something you just referenced? A.   Yes.

Q. "Effects of smoking and smoke constituents on the electrical activity in the human brain."

Was that a -- an ongoing concern, research effort in Philip Morris over the years?

A.   Yeah, very sophisticated research looking at brain activity using electrodes.  You know, at this time in the late '70s, that's pretty sophisticated.  I mean, today we're doing brain scans and so on, but it was pretty sophisticated research at the time.

Q. "Effects of changes in smoke composition upon puffing behavior, inhalation behavior, and descriptive statements by the smoker."

Is it common at Philip Morris to have people smoking, study them, and then ask them questions about their responses to particular experiences when smoking?

A.   Yeah.  They had extensive biobehavioral research that they did and had panels of smokers come in, and they would -- they'd give them different experimental cigarettes to see what their response was on a whole range of things.

rats, training them to discriminate nicotine injections from saline based on CNS infects -- effects of the injections.

What is CNS?

A.   Central nervous system.

Q.   And is the central nervous system where nicotine has its effects on the human brain?

A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Can we look over just briefly,

Ryan, at the next page. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Again, we see, for example, monitoring of motor activity; looking at tolerance to nicotine in rats; prostration syndrome, where they are implanting rats with cannula in the lateral ventricles and then injecting a variety of nicotine analogues into the brain to determine if they elicit prostration syndrome.  We see at the bottom, rat EEGs.

Is it a sophisticated operation by the standard scientific standards at the time, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Yeah, very sophisticated.  They're, you know, mainlining nicotine into the brain of the rat, basically.

And also they talk about analogues, so they were testing other agents as well and -- very

sophisticated research.

Q.   And, finally, at the bottom of this page, "Electroencephalographic Studies From Mr. Gullotta."

Is that Frank Gullotta who we've seen copied on a lot of these documents?

A.   Yes.

Q.   "The major objective of all the studies to be conducted in the neuropsychology laboratory is to understand the interrelationships between cigarette smoking and the human brain."

Does all of this, Dr. Cummings, relate ultimately to addiction?

A. Yeah. Actually, it ultimately relates to how they can use this research. As they said right on the front page of this document, I think it's to understand the psychological reward the smoker gets when smoking, to understand the physio -- psychophysiolog- --psychophysiology underlying this reward, and to relate this reward to the constituents in smoke.

And the rationale for the program, it rests on the premise that such knowledge will strengthen Philip Morris's R&D compas- -- capability in developing new and improved smoking products.

Q.   So let's take a look at the next page.  I have one other question for you on this document, and that's

at the bottom:  "Long-term smoke deprivation and electrical activity of the brain.

"In terms of electrical activity of the brain, there can be little doubt that smokers and nonsmokers are very different.  It is also true that the brains of deprived smokers are quite different from the brains of both nondeprived smokers and nonsmokers."

Does that relate to withdrawal and addiction that you described to the jury yesterday, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Yes, it does.

Q.   And this was a document -- would this document would have been -- become public in Lamar Danielson's lifetime?

A.   No.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Could we go back to the

PowerPoint, please, Ryan. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   We've looked at sort of the scientific end of it.  I think you've mentioned before Mr. Dunn was there. Also a -- a whole psychological program at Philip Morris devoted to understanding smokers and smoking?

A.   Yeah.  This is the same program.  This is his, you know, summary of the basic model that -- the operant conditioning document.  And he's -- in 1977, Bill Dunn is writing to his boss, Tom Osdene, and he's describing

the -- I would state our charter for this nature of this research that they were doing is the study of the psychology of the smoker and search of the information that can increase corporate profits. Q.   That was LP0067.

I want to show you LP0190 briefly, Dr. Cummings, and I'm sorry to block the -- block the screen for a moment.

This is a memorandum, September 9th of 1980, from Mr. Knopick to Mr. Kloepfer.

Who were Mr. Knopick and Mr. Kloepfer? A.   Mr. Kloepfer was the vice president in charge of public relations for the Tobacco Institute.  And Mr. Knopick was -- he was the -- he was an employee of the Tobacco Institute, and he put out the Tobacco Observer newsletter that used to be the Tobacco and Health newsletter that the Tobacco Institute sent out on issues related to smoking and health.

And they -- he's commenting in this particular memo about some stories that had come out in early 1980 about the National Institutes on Drug Abuse director talking about nicotine and cigarettes as addictive.

And that -- he's now in the -- in the statement at the end of the memo apologizing that he had sort of missed some of that, but he comments that the -- "The

law firm reminds us, I'm told, that the entire matter of addiction is the most potent weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer cigarette case.  We can't defend continued smoking as, quote, 'free choice' if the person was addicted."

Q.   You've already given your opinion in this case, Dr. Cummings, that Mr. Danielson was addicted?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Have you seen any documents in Philip Morris over all the studying, all the time, all the pages that you've looked at that suggest that smoking is just a matter of free choice -- internal documents?

A.   No.

Q.   Now, in 1994 did the heads of the cigarette companies appear in Congress?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what was the purpose of these Congressional hearings?  Just in a word.

A.   Well, they were asked to come before Congress and give their statements on issues related to smoking and health, including nicotine addiction, because at that time the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Kessler, had raised the issue that cigarettes are addictive and maybe the Food and Drug Administration ought to be regulating it.

So there were Congressional hearings, the

at the time, Henry Waxman.

And the CEOs of the major cigarette companies

did appear.  They gave statements, and then they were

asked questions by the committee.

Q.   And would this have been about six months

before Mr. Danielson was diagnosed with lung cancer?

A.   Yes.  This was April of 1994.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And it's LP Clip 1749-A, if we

MR. JAMES JOHNSTON:  Congressman, cigarettes and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definitions of addiction.  There is no intoxication.

REPRESENTATIVE WYDEN:  We'll take that as a no.

And, again, time is short.  If you can just --I think each of you believe nicotine is not addictive.  We just would like to have this for the record.

A.   Yeah.  Bill Campbell from Philip Morris.  He was the chairman of Philip Morris at the time.

Q.   And this would have been 30-plus years since the 1959 Geiger memo you showed the jury where they say people smoked for addiction?

A.   Correct.

Q.   The Tobacco Institute -- this particular document, LP0284, this is a memo to Earle Clements.  Who was Mr. Clements at the time?

A.   He was the president of the Tobacco Institute. I mentioned Horace Kornegay, but Earle Clements preceded him.  He was the president in the late 1960s. I think this is a memo from 1968.

Q.   And is this a -- an internal memo to the Tobacco Institute?  One that would not be shared with the public?

A.   Yes.  This is an internal memo that was written to Earle Clements from William Kloepfer, who was the vice president in charge of public affairs.  And, you know, it's in relationship to reestablishing the cigarette controversy, which was happening right at this time.

Q.   Would this be on the heels, for example, of that Tiderock document you showed the jury a little while ago?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And Mr. Kloepfer tells the head of the Tobacco Institute:  "Our basic position in the cigarette controversy is subject to the charge and may be subject to a finding that we are making false and misleading statements to promote the sale of cigarettes." Correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Now, the -- as we kind of come to the close of this, Dr. Cummings, I want to look back retrospectively. When we talk about those sorts of statements, the cigarette controversy, they go all the way back to 1954?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And we see examples here from documents that we've already shown the jury through the 1950s, through the 1960s, and 1970s.  Was this a constant drumbeat from the industry in terms of this controversy over smoking, doubts about smoking health charge?

A.   Yes.  It went on for 45 years.  From 1954 until the Tobacco Institute and CTR went out of business. 1998 is when they ended.

Q.   And did the industry spend more than a billion dollars funding the TI and the CTR?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   And was their sole purpose to spread this

message?

A.   That is what they did, yes.

Q.   I want to ask you -- you've read all the facts in this case about Mr. Danielson and, you know, his interaction, if you will, with society through television, newspapers, et cetera.  Based on your review of the whole record, is there any doubt in your mind that Mr. Danielson would have been surrounded during his lifetime with these messages?

A.   Yes.  It's part of the information environment that was out there.  That environment included cigarette advertising.  It included the statements from the tobacco companies, as well as the statements coming out from the Surgeon General's Reports and, you know, public health authorities, which increased over time.

Q.   And to be fair, Dr. Cummings, I think I asked you is there any doubt in your mind, and you said "Yes," but I think we all understood --

A.   There's no doubt.

Q.   -- your answer.

A.   He was exposed.

Q.   And you've already given us your opinion that Mr. Danielson was addicted.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I appreciate it, Dr. Cummings.

direct examination of this witness.  Now the defendant's counsel will have an opportunity to conduct a cross-examination. Mr. Geraghty.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you, Your Honor. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. K. MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D., MPH, having been previously duly sworn or affirmed, continued to testify under oath as follows:

CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Cummings.  How are you doing?

A.   Very good.  Thanks.

Q.   Do you know my name is Bill Geraghty and I represent Philip Morris USA in this case? A.   Yes.

Q.   Let me start by asking you what I think will be the easiest question I'll ask you all afternoon.

True or false, Dr. Cummings, even addicted smokers can quit smoking? A.   True.

Q.   There are 60 million ex-smokers in the United States, right?

A.   Approximately, yes.

Q.   And a very high percentage of those 60 million ex-smokers would be considered highly addicted according to the standards that you discussed yesterday with Mr. Schultz?

A.   Correct.

Q.   I don't think I heard you mention the word "dopamine," but I did hear you I think at one point talk about different neurotransmitters, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   Dopamine being one of those neurotransmitters?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So you said that the neurotransmitters are released when smokers inhale nicotine through cigarette smoke?

A.   True.

Q.   And the majority of those 60 million smokers who've quit in this country would have experienced that same release of neurotransmitters that you've described yesterday?

A.   True.

Q.   Now, you talked -- sort of at the very end, shortly before lunch, you talked about I guess certain design features of cigarettes, and I think you were talking specifically about Marlboro.

But I heard you mention some additives used in

the manufacture of cigarettes, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   You mentioned something called reconstituted tobacco, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Which I think you also referred to as man-made tobacco?

A.   Correct.  It is manufactured; it's not a natural product.

Q.   And you talked about the pH of smoke, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you talked about ammonia?

A. Ammonia is one of the things that's naturally in tobacco, so you can blend for ammonia levels or you can add it to the recon.

Q.   And the majority of the 60 million ex-smokers in this country would have smoked cigarettes with many of those same sort of design features that you described yesterday and earlier this morning, correct?

A.   Well, reconstituted tobacco came in, in the 1950s.  The percentage of recon used in tobacco in different products changed over time.  And Marlboro changed repeatedly over time.  So the product didn't stay constant.  And that's true of some of the additives as well.  They are more common in the cigarettes really

in the '60s, '70s, '80s.

Q.   Let me try again, Doctor.

My question is:  The majority of the 60 million ex-smokers in this country would have smoked cigarettes with many of the same design features that you discussed in your testimony both earlier today and yesterday?

A.   Well, true and false.  I mean, some of those --majority of those people -- because quitting smoking tends to be age-related; so older people are more likely to quit, and many of the older smokers in that 60 million probably started out on cigarettes that didn't have reconstituted tobacco, but they undoubtedly switched to products that did.  So at some point in their life I guess the answer would be yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  (After perusing document) This is -- sorry, I need the -- we -- it's the p.m. volume.  Okay.

MR. GERAGHTY:  My apologies, Your Honor.  I was looking at the wrong thing.

BY MR. GERAGHTY:
	
Q.
	Dr. Cummings, I handed you a transcript from a

case called Starbuck, right?
	
A.
	Correct.

Q.
	And the date of that transcript is December the

3rd, 2014, correct?
	
A.
	That's right.

Q.
	And Starbuck was a case where you testified,

right?
	

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	In Jacksonville?

A.
	Correct.

Q.
	And the date of your testimony was December the

3rd, 2014?
	
A.
	True.

Q.
	A little less than a year ago, correct?

A.
	That's right.

Q.
	And let me draw your attention to Page 9.

A.

	And you were asked the following question and

million ex-smokers in this country would have smoked cigarettes with many of the same design features that you discussed in your testimony earlier today, correct?" And your answer there was, "Sure." Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   And that's the testimony that you gave under oath in that case in Jacksonville, Florida less than a year ago?

A.   True.

Q.   Now, many of the 60 million ex-smokers would have smoked Marlboro cigarettes just like Mr. Danielson, right?

A.   True.

Q.   And the truth is a very high percentage of those 60 million ex-smokers quit smoking cold turkey, did they not?

A.   That is true.

Q.   And in common language cold turkey means without assistance?

A.   Well, true, although cold turkey usually means people often use things like chewing gums and mints and other substitutes; but, yeah, without formal assistance like medication or going to a -- a formal clinic or talking to a doctor.

Q.   Let me try again, Doctor.

My question is:  In common language, cold turkey means without any assistance whatsoever, yes or no?

A.   Well, I just -- the answer is -- I just gave the answer.

It's without formalized assistance, going to a doctor, using a prescribed medication; but using aids like chewing gum and mints and toothpicks and things of that nature that people often do, that's considered cold turkey as well.

MR. GERAGHTY:  May I approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  You may.

MR. GERAGHTY:  (Handing) There you go, Dr. Cummings.

THE WITNESS:  Thank you. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   I've handed you a transcript, Dr. Cummings. It's in Re:  Engle cases. Do you see that? A.   Correct.

Q.   It's dated Thursday, July 24th, 2014, right? A.   Yes. Q.   And this was a videotaped deposition that you

gave, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And a videotaped deposition is intended to be as if you were testifying in court, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Right.  And you were under oath?

A.   True.

Q.   And you swore that the answers you gave would be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, right?

A.   As I always do.

Q.   Okay.  And let me ask you to take a look at Page 374 of the transcript --

A.   Okay.

Q.   -- Lines 18 through 24.

A.   Okay.

Q.   I'm going to read this to you.

The question starts:  "And the truth is a very high percentage of those 60 million ex-smokers quit smoking cold turkey, did they not? "ANSWER:  Yes, they did.

"QUESTION:  And in common language, 'cold turkey' means, you know, without any assistance whatsoever.

"ANSWER:  Without assistance, yes."

Did I read all that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   And that was the answer you gave to that question under oath on July the 24th of 2014, a little over a year ago.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, this isn't the first time you've testified on behalf of either a cigarette smoker or the family of a cigarette smoker against Philip Morris?

A.   True.

Q.   You've been testifying against Philip Morris for approximately 19 years?

A.   That's right.

Q.   I think you told us yesterday since 1996.

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you've given testimony in over 120 depositions in cases in which Philip Morris was a defendant, a party in the case, right?

A.   True.  Probably more than that.

Q.   Right.  And you have testified in trials, just like you're doing here today, in cases against Philip Morris over 100 times?

A.   Well, I'm not sure I've done that many trials, but I thought the estimate was 70 -- you may have a better record than I do, but 70 or 80, I think I was

asked about, in terms of personal cases.  And then I've done a number of large cases, the class cases as they're referred to.

Q.   My question is, you've testified in trials like this one over 100 times, is that true, or you don't believe?

A.   For trial, no.  Maybe my video depositions have been used, because I've permitted those to be used by anybody after I've done 'em.

Q.   Isn't it true, sir, that just last year, at the end of last year, you said you had testified in over 90 trials against Philip Morris?

A.   I may have said that if I had been shown something.  I would have to see the context of what I was shown.

Q.   I'm happy to show it to you, if you think that I'm inaccurate.

A.   I think I was asked about personal cases.  I said about 70 to 80.  And if you want to add all the cases, probably about 90 would be about accurate.

Q.   Okay.  That was as of a year ago.

A.   That's right.  I've done five cases this year.

Q.   Okay.  So it may not be exactly a hundred, but we're closing in on a hundred trials in which you have testified against Philip Morris in a case like this one?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And we can go back over the last couple of years, but you've testified all over the State of Florida, have you not?

A.   Florida and many other states.

Q.   Well, my -- my question is specific to Florida. Is it not true that over the last four or five, six years you have testified all over the State of Florida?

A.   That is true.

Q.   And you've testified here in Pensacola many times, have you not?

A.   Yes, I have.

Q.   You've testified in this courthouse specifically seven or eight times, right?

A.   Yes.

We talked about Jacksonville earlier, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   You're right.  And you've testified in front of dozens of other juries, correct?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And you've shown those other juries most, if not all, of the documents that you and Mr. Schultz discussed during the course of your direct examination this morning and yesterday, correct?

A.   That's true.

Q.   Let's go back just over the last, let's say, five years.  In -- we'll say four years.

A. Well, I think some of them were outside, and I think there was a class action-like case that I did out in California.

Q.   Well, cases in which Philip Morris was a defendant in the case.

A.   They were a defendant.

Q.   In 2013, you testified in 20 trials, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And 2014, you testified in 18 trials?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And this is your sixth or seventh trial this year in 2015, correct?

A.   I think it's the sixth one I've done.  I've done five, and this is the sixth.

Q.   You think this is the sixth one this year in the calendar year of 2015?

MR. GERAGHTY:  All right. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Sorry about that, Dr. Cummings.

A.   No problem.

Q.   You have more trials scheduled for the remainder of this year, 2015, maybe?

A.   That's true.

Q.   There are lots of other cases filed against Philip Morris throughout the State of Florida, right?

A.   That's my understanding.

Q.   And you know you've met many of the lawyers who file those lawsuits, and you know that those lawyers have named you as a witness in their case and that they expect, at least some of them, that you'll come to testify live at the trial they have in front of other jurors in the future cases?

A.   I've told them they can use my video any time they want.

But some of them, yes, I have committed to do live.  I believe I have two trials scheduled after this one that I've agreed to appear live at.

Q.   Testifying has become almost a second job for you, has it not?

A.   Sure.

Q.   You've testified in other trials that Mr. Schultz and his law firm have brought, have you not?

A.   I have.

Q.   This is, in fact, your fifth time testifying in a case in which Mr. Schultz's firm has filed a lawsuit on behalf of the smoker or the family of the smoker, right?

A.   That's true.

Q. You get paid for the time that you spend testifying in these kinds of cases against Philip Morris, right?

A.   I do.

Q.   I believe you told us yesterday -- correct me if I've got the number wrong, but I thought you told us yesterday that you were charging $250 for your time?

A.   $250 per hour for testimony.

Q.   Right, and I appreciate you clarifying that.

$250 per hour for the time you spend reviewing materials, reading depositions, meeting with the lawyers, giving a deposition and ultimately testifying in front of the jury like you're doing here today?

A.   No.  I charge $200 an hour for external work, like reading depositions and preparing for testimony. So it's $200 an hour, and then 250 when I do trial

testimony.

Q.   All right.  And so I misspoke.  $200 for the time you spend before you come into the courtroom to testify?

A.   That is true.

Q.   And $250 an hour for the time you spend in the courtroom testifying?

A.   Correct.

Q. You have recently started to charge a $4,000 retainer fee for each case in which you were asked to get involved?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  So -- so the way that works, a retainer fee is if a lawyer says, "Dr. Cummings, I'd like you to serve as an expert witness in my case," before you really do anything, you say, "Well, you need to pay me that $4,000 retainer," and that serves as sort of an advance over whatever time you might devote to the case; is that fair?

A.   I have a retainer.  It goes to a particular place.  It doesn't come to me.  I could explain it if you'd like.

Q.   Well, let me ask you this, then.  Let's go back and talk about the amount of money you've earned over the last five or six years, for example?

A.   Sure.

Q.   In 2010, you were paid approximately $200,000 for the time you spent working on and testifying in cases just like this one?

A.   That's true.

Q.   The next year, 2011, you were paid more than $225,000 for the time you spent testifying in cases like this against Philip Morris and other companies, right?

A.   True.

Q.   In 2012, that number was more than $200,000, again, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And in 2013, you made over $200,000 that year from your work on cases like this?

A.   Yeah.  I think 2013 was probably around 250 to 300, as I recall, because it was the 20 trials that I did.  It was a very busy year.

Q.   Okay.  And in 2014, you made between 200 and $225,000 for your work in cases like this, possibly more?

A. Yeah. It was about 200,000 or so, as I recall, from my income tax.

Q. So you've earned more than a million dollars in the last five years testifying against Philip Morris and other cigarette companies in cases like this one?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Now, in addition to testifying like you're doing here today, you've also made yourself available to provide information to lawyers who file lawsuits against tobacco companies, have you not?

A.   I've provided it to anybody who wants to listen to the information I have.  But I have given seminars. I've been invited to do seminars for law schools.  I think Northeastern University, when I first got the archive, asked me to come talk about the archives that had come to Roswell Park from the Tobacco Institute and CTR.  And I went up and gladly gave a lecture about what was there, what we were doing with the archive and how they could access it.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would move to strike that as

nonresponsive to my question.

THE COURT:  The question:  "You've also made

yourself available to provide information to lawyers

who file lawsuits against tobacco companies, have

you not?"  Okay.  So I would ask you to respond

directly to his question.

THE WITNESS:  Sure.  Yes.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  And I would grant the

motion to strike the response given. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Now, you've participated in seminars for lawyers who are learning or were learning how to sue tobacco companies, right?

A.   That was what I just described, yes, I have.

Q.   And not just to sue tobacco companies but to win large verdicts against cigarette companies, right?

A. I think the title of the conference was "How to Win a Just Verdict."

Q.   Well, let me try again.

My question was not just to sue tobacco companies, but how to win large verdicts against cigarette companies, correct?

A.   That was not the title of the conference.

Q. Well, let me ask you, do you still have that --that transcript, the first one I gave you from that case called Starbuck?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Let me ask you to take a look at Page 19.

"You've participated in seminars for the lawyers who sue tobacco companies?  Yes or no. "ANSWER:  Yes.

"QUESTION:  And not just to sue tobacco companies but how to win large verdicts against cigarette companies, correct?"

And your answer was:  "Sure." Did I read that all correctly?

A.   Yes, you read that correctly.  But you can read the rest of it if you'd like.

Q.   Well, isn't it true that you attended a seminar in Boston in 2002 called, "How to Win a Just Tobacco Verdict"?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Just so there's no doubt, a just tobacco verdict, in your mind, is one in which the plaintiff wins a large verdict, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The conference that you attended back in 2002 wasn't open to the public.

A.   It was open to anybody who would sign an affidavit that they don't work for cigarette companies. So anybody could go.

Q.   To attend the conference, you had to sign -- I

think you just alluded to this.  To attend that conference, you had to sign an affidavit stating that you would never do work for a tobacco company of any kind, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you signed that affidavit?

A.   I did.

Q.   And you gave, I believe, two different presentations at that conference, did you not?

A.   Yes.  I talked about the Frank Statement, which talked about the TI and CTR repositories, as I indicated.  And I also gave a second lecture there on the advertising archives that I had accumulated.  And so those were the two lectures I gave.

Q.   Right.  My question simply is, you gave two different presentations at that seminar?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, this wasn't your presentation, but one of the other presentations at that seminar you attended was called "Keys to Giant Verdicts" --

A.   That's true.

Q.   -- right?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   And at that conference back in 2002, you met lawyers who were filing lawsuits like this lawsuit

against Philip Morris, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And some of the lawyers that you met at that conference later hired you to testify in tobacco lawsuits, correct?

A.   Some of them did.

Q.   And you've participated in what's referred to as a "mock trial" --

A.   I have.

Q.   -- right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the mock trial was conducted by plaintiffs' lawyers who were suing Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.  I did that one time in a case in Louisiana.

Q.   And the mock trial was an audition to see who they wanted to hire to testify for them?

A.   That was my assumption as to why they were doing it.  They just asked me to come down and participate.  And so they had a jury, they had a judge. They had lawyers that served as plaintiffs and defendants.  And I was there and served as a witness. They asked me a bunch of questions just like we're doing here.  And I later testified, I think, four or five days in that case.

Q. Okay. Doctor -- Dr. Cummings, my question was, the mock trial was an audition to see who they wanted to hire to testify for them, yes or no?

A. Yes, that was my assumption. You'd have to ask the lawyers why they did it, but that was my assumption.

Q. Okay. And you were paid for your participation in the mock trial, right?

A.   I was.

Q.   Doctor, isn't it true that you consider yourself to be involved in what you call a war against tobacco?

A.   I've written an article of that title, so I guess, yes, I have been.  I certainly -- I'm not a fan of tobacco.

Q.   Okay.  Are you even -- you mentioned this, I think, in the answer you just gave, but you, in fact, wrote an article with that in the title, "the war against tobacco," right?

A.   That's right, for the Journal of Cancer.

Q.   And you believe that by testifying in cases like this one, that you bring or you're bringing your war against tobacco into the courtroom?

A. Well, it's not my war. But I have unique knowledge and I feel an obligation, because of the information that just happened to land in my lap and

what I knew, to come into courtrooms.  It's part of what I feel is an obligation as a public health, you know, official in this country.  And so I've -- I made it part of what I do.

Q.   Urn --

A.   I guess that would be a yes to your question. If you want to say that I think this is part of what we need to do in public health, the answer is yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I move to strike

that as nonresponsive to my question.

THE COURT:  I would deny the request to strike.

Thank you.

Q. Dr. Cummings, in fact, in testifying in cases just like this one, you believe you were bringing your war against tobacco into the courtroom, true or false?

A.   I guess true, based on the answer I just gave.

Q.   And when you testify you want the plaintiff to win the case, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   You mentioned -- well, let me ask you this: You have had media training yourself, right, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Well, not really formal training.  I got it on

the job.  Because -- as I mentioned, because of the research I did and because I became pretty well known in the field when I was at Roswell, now at the medical university, when there's stories out, I'm usually the person they come to, and you sort of learn it on the job.

So I haven't received any formal training.  I haven't gone to the college of knowledge or any of these places where they train you on how to answer questions.

Q.   Let me try again, Dr. Cummings.

A.   Sure.

Q.   You have had media training, have you not?

A.   On the job, yeah.

Q.   Okay.  You attended a conference at the National Cancer Institute that included instructions on how to respond to questions about smoking and health issues, right?

A.   No.  There was a booklet that was written by somebody who was involved in that conference after the conference that was a media guide that I've used in actually teaching graduate students because I thought it was well done.

But there was no media training at that conference that I think you're referring to that was head at the National Cancer Institute.

Q. Well, are you now -- you just said there wasn't media training. Are you telling me that you haven't had media training?

A.   On the job.  I've told you the training I've had, which is, you know, I was put in front of a camera or a microphone for radio and asked to describe the implications of scientific findings, and oftentimes those were adversarial, you know, interviews, because there was often a public relations person from the Tobacco Institute.  So I've seen firsthand what we described earlier.

Q.   I've handed you a transcript you have there, Dr. Cummings?

Q.   Okay.  Did you receive a booklet about a year after the conference?

A.   Yes, I did.

Q.   Okay.  And you used the booklet in your own courses where you teach, did you not?

A.   True.  In health communications.

Q.   One of the booklets says that if you get a question that you don't like, one thing you can do is you ask the question that you believe should be asked, right?

A.   Are you reading out of the booklet?

Q.   No, I'm asking you a question, sir.

A.   Okay.  Could you just -- I'm not quite following what you're asking.

Q.   I'll try it again.

One thing that booklet says is if you get a question that you don't like, one thing you can do is ask the question that you believe should be asked, right?

person, sent to me a year later.

Q.   But you agree that the booklet you received says that, right?

A.   Sure.  And I use it as part of health communications to educate our public health students about, you know, public relations strategies that are often used, and they outline some of those strategies in that guide.

Q.   Let's switch gears.  I want to move on to a different topic.

Dr. Cummings, you believe that anyone who is a daily cigarette smoker is addicted, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you believe that a person who smokes just one cigarette a day on a persistent daily basis is addicted, right?

A.   Yes.  At a low level, but yes.

Q.   Now, on direct you testified about addiction, and you gave at least one definition of addiction that I heard you talked about, the definition from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, right, or -- or NIDA?

A.   That's right.

Q.   So you talked about a definition.

Isn't it true that you personally have used the terms "addiction" and "habit" interchangeably over the

years?

A.   Sure.

Q. And no matter what term you use, you agree it's the behavior, not the label that's important?

A.   Well, it's the effect on the individual's brain and their addiction that's important.  But, yeah, when you're talking -- use those labels you can see habit, addiction, dependence.  These terms are often used interchangeably.  And I've -- you can find citations of things that I've written many years in the past where we use them interchangeably, because you're trying to communicate to the public.

Q.   Doctor, let me try again.

No matter what term you use, you agree it's the behavior, not the label that's important?

A.   Sure.  Sure.

Q. Now, I don't have the slide, but the slide that you show -- we were talking about the NIDA definition of addiction, right?

A.   Right.

Q. And I'm going to paraphrase, but you tell me if I get this wrong.

A.   I will.

Q.   It starts by -- I know you'll tell me if I get this wrong.  So it starts with addiction is a chronic

A.   No.

Q.   You can't diagnose a patient with any kind of condition?

A.   No, I can't.

Q.   You can't treat a patient medically, can you?

A.   Not medically.  I don't -- not licensed as a medical doctor, so I -- I can't treat people as a medical doctor.

diagnosis of nicotine addiction or nicotine dependence, are you?

A.   No, I'm not licensed in that way.

Q.   And you can't prescribe smoking cessation aids that are on the market today, for example, like Zyban or Chantix?

A.   No, I can't prescribe those, because I'm not a medical doctor so I'm not licensed to prescribe prescription drugs.

Q.   All right.  Now, let's switch gears and we're going to sort of go back in time a bit here.

Tobacco has been grown in this country for hundreds of years, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it's been known that nicotine is in tobacco going back to the early 1800s?

A.   Yes.

Q.   200 years ago?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Smoking has been referred to as addictive and an addiction for more than 100 years?

A.   Well, you can find the odd reference to it, but certainly more recently from '88 on.

Q.   Well, let me try again.

Smoking has been referred to as addictive and

as an addiction for more than 100 years?

A.   Sure.  You can go back and you can find the odd reference that mentions addiction, but that's not the way it was really reflected.  And more recently, because of the Surgeon General's Report, you see the term "addiction" now applied almost uniformly to, you know, nicotine addiction.

Q.   Let me ask you to take a look at that --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- transcript that says "In Re: Engle cases"?

A.   Okay.  Got it.

Q.   You have it?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   Let me ask you to take a look at page 383.

A.   All right.

Q.   And, again, for -- so everyone's with us, this was testimony you gave under oath on July the 24th of 2014, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And lines 8 through 10, let me read this to you.  You were asked the following question:

"QUESTION:  Smoking has been referred to as addictive and as an addiction for more than 100 years? "ANSWER:  Sure." Did I read that correctly?

A.   You read that correctly, but the context for the answer is in the next question and answer.

Q.   All right.  Well, let me ask you, then, sir, isn't it true that the popular press in this country here in the United States has talked about the fact that smoking can be dangerous and difficult to quit for more than 100 years?

A.   Yeah, you can find references back that long, but, you know, the common knowledge of the dangers of smoking and addiction really are more recent.

Q.   All right.  Well, let me -- do you have the --the transcript from the Jacksonville case from December of just this past year?

A.   I was just reading from the other one.  Okay, let's go.  Jacksonville?

Q.   Yes, sir.

A.   Okay.  Got it.

A.   Yes.

Q.   The popular press -- I'm sorry, let me slow down.  QUESTION -- I'm reading this from line 3 through line 7.

"QUESTION:  The popular press in this country here in the United States has talked about that fact that smoking can be dangerous and difficult to quit for more than 100 years, right?"

And your answer was, "Sure," correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it's been common knowledge in this country for more than 100 years that it can be difficult for people to quit smoking, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And like we talked about in your own writings, people in this country have used the terms "habit" and "addiction" to refer to cigarette smoking interchangeably for over 100 years?

A.   True.

Q.   Now, let's go back in time and let's go long before Mr. Lamar Danielson was born.  Okay?  We're going to go back 500 years to when Christopher Columbus discovers the New World in 1492, all right?

A.   Okay.

arrive here in America, they notice that the Native Americans were actually already using tobacco, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   They were smoking tobacco?

A.   Smoking and chewing.

Q.   And that's what -- the 1988 Surgeon General's Report has a reference to this, correct?

A.   They give a history.  I think you're reading right out of it.

Q.   Now, when Columbus and his sailors returned to Europe, he notes in his diary more than 500 years ago that his men were having a hard time giving up tobacco.

A.   True.

Q.   They were suffering from the same symptoms that today we would call "withdrawal."

A.   True.

Q.   And so Christopher Columbus in his diary more than 500 years ago in 1492 observed that his men who now no longer had tobacco were experiencing the same kinds of symptoms that yesterday you described as withdrawal symptoms.

A.   True.

Q.   Now, some folks here in the United States have referred to themselves as addicted to tobacco going back more than 150 years; isn't that true?

A.   No.

Q.   So let's take a look at the letter he wrote in 1845.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Can we get the Elmo, please? Thank you.

Can everyone see that okay?  Everyone -- okay. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   So this is a letter.  It says -- this was written by -- this is written by John Quincy Adams to --it says at the top to Reverend Daniel H. Cox, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And it's dated the 19th of August 1845.  I've highlighted that in the far right-hand column, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And so in 1845 John Quincy Adams writes, quote, "In my early youth I was addicted to the use of tobacco and two of its mysteries:  Smoking and chewing." Right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And then it goes on to say, "I was warned by a medical friend of the pernicious operation of this habit upon the stomach and the nerves, and the advice of the physical was fortified by the results of my own experience.

deliberately renounced the use of tobacco in all its forms.  And although the resolution was not carried to execution without a struggle of" -- and I think the word there is "vitiated nature" -- "I never yielded to its impulses; and in the space of three or four months of self-denial, they lost their stimulating power and I have never since felt it as a privation." Did I read all that correctly?

A.   You did.  I think this is a typed version.

Q.   Right.

A.   This is a handwritten letter, actually.

Q.   Sure, and I'll show --

A.   I think it's on the back.  There you go.

Q.   We've typed it so it's a little more legible than his handwriting.

A.   Sure.

Q.   Now, so this is -- this is 1845.  This was over 150 years ago, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, you're familiar with Mark Twain, are you not?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Mark Twain is one of the most famous American authors, right?

A.   Absolutely.

Q.   He wrote Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer; isn't that right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And Mark Twain was quoted as saying famously back in the 1880s:  "Quitting smoking is easy.  I've done it thousands of times." Right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what Mark Twain was referring to in a humorous way was the concept of relapse that you discussed yesterday during your testimony with Mr. Schultz, right?

A.   True.

Q.   And what Mark Twain said was funny, because it was ironic, correct?

A.   Well, actually, it's not funny when you think of the consequences of that; but certainly he was known for his humor and he was making a joke out of the fact that quitting smoking is the easiest thing in the world to do.  "I've done it a thousand times before," I think is the exact quote.

Q.   Right.  So everybody understood that what Mark Twain really meant was the exact opposite of what he said, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   I quit; I go back; I quit; I go back; I quit; I go back.

A.   Right.

Q.   So in a funny way he's saying the opposite. Not that it's easy; it can be very difficult?

A.   Right.

Q.   That's the same concept of relapse in that definition of addiction from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, chronic relapsing brain disease, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Of course, he's referring to it in a --certainly a more colloquial way than that definition?

A.   It's a good presentation I use in my clinics with smokers.

Q.   I'm sorry, I couldn't hear what you said.

A.   I think it's a good characterization.  It is a chronic relapsing disorder, and I use the Mark Twain quote with smokers in my clinic.

Q.   Okay.  And he said that in 1880, over 135 years ago?

A.   That's right.

Q.   That's an observation he made simply by observing not only his own issue of tobacco, but the use of tobacco by other people?

A.   I think he was commenting on his own

experience.

Q.   We know in 1880s people were smoking cigars, smoking pipes, smoking cigarettes, right?

A.   In 1880s there wasn't a lot of cigarette smoking.

Q.   There --

A.   But for the most part, people were using cigars and chewing tobacco.  Those were the main forms of tobacco.  Cigarettes really take off in this country after they're automated with the automated smoking machinery with the American blend, which dates really to 1913 with the introduction of Camel cigarettes.

Q.   My question is simply:  Were people smoking cigarettes in this country in the 1880s, yes or no?

A. Sure. You can find a very small percentage of people who were smoking cigarettes. I don't think Mark Twain was one of them, though.

Q.   Now, people recognize -- well, let me go back here.  The other part of that definition -- we've talked about the NIDA definition being chronic relapsing brain disorder.

And then I think the next sort of part of it refers to compulsive drug-seeking behavior?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Or drug-seeking use?

A.   Drug-seeking use.

Q.   All right.  And people recognized as early as the 1920s and the 1930s in this country, before Mr. Danielson was born, that cigarette smokers compulsively used cigarettes, right?

A.   That became apparent really with the introduction of the American blended cigarette, which permitted inhalation and delivery of nicotine more efficiently to the brain; and that's where you see people smoking on a persistent daily basis, you know, a pack a day or more and that's compulsive use, yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I move to strike as nonresponsive.

THE COURT:  (After perusing realtime) There were portions that were not responsive, and I'll simply ask you to respond more directly to the question asked:  "And people recognized as early as the 1920s and the 1930s in this country, before Mr. Danielson was born, that cigarette smokers compulsively used cigarettes, right?"

internal cigarette company document to make that observation, right?

A.   True.

Q.   Now, you know that people have used terms like "nicotine fiend" and "nicotine fit" to refer to the use of cigarettes going back well over 100 years, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the terms "nicotine fiend" and "nicotine fit" convey the notion, No. 1, that cigarette smoking is hard to quit, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   And, No. 2, that nicotine specifically is the reason why people find it hard to quit, correct?

A.   People had urges to smoke and it was for nicotine.

Q.   Right.  I mean, they refer to people as drug fiends; and so when you're saying someone is a nicotine fiend, they're saying, hey, they're a drug fiend.  The drug that they're a fiend of in this instance is nicotine?

A.   I think the terms were used -- I've certainly heard smokers talk about them when they have a strong urge to smoke.  They talk about, you know, having a nicotine fit.

Q.   And, Doctor, the fact that nicotine is the

reason why people find it hard to quit, that was no secret in the 1920s and 1930s?

A.   No.  As I've said, people, you know, who are smokers figure out that it's hard to quit so it's not a secret.

Q.   Right.  And I think you kind of alluded to the point I wanted to make.

If you're a cigarette smoker and you just sort of pay attention to your own behavior and you try to quit, the first time you try to quit you figure out that it may not be very easy to quit?

A. Actually, what I've learned is people find that it's hard to quit but they don't understand why.

Q.   Okay.

A. And that's the part that smokers actually don't understand. Because that information has been concealed from them.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would move to

strike the last part of that answer as

nonresponsive.

Q.   And let me show you --

MR. GERAGHTY:  This is PMU7022.

They should all be in the order in which I used

them; but if you have any trouble, let me know. MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Okay.  So this is the -- let me pump it down just a little bit so it all appears.

Can you see that, Dr. Cummings?

A.   I can.

Q.   It says "Florida Health Notes, Official Bulletin of the State Board of Health of Florida, published monthly at Jacksonville, Florida."

And the date here is July 1906 to June 1907, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And let's look -- it's a -- what -- what the Florida Health Notes are, it's a collection of articles that have certain health ramifications or health issues discussed and they collect them in this journal?

A.   Yes.  I mean, I think, you know, they have --from all different kinds of sources; but, yes, that's true.

Q.   And let me show you an article here.  You've seen this before.  It's called Cigarettes and the Boys,

right?

A.   That's right.  This one came from The Healthy Home.

Q.   And this one says this is from 1906 to 1907. "Today the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the very worst form of tobacco addiction." Right?

A.   Yes.  But that's not the full context.

Q.   I'm happy to read the whole thing if you want me to read it.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  It says, "Today the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the very worst form of tobacco addiction.  It is so cheap, it is so generally inhaled, it is often so loaded with drugs, and so many times made from cigar stumps and street scrapings, that there is every argument against its use."

Did I read it correctly so far?

A.   You have.

Q.   And then the next paragraph says, "Reverend James L. Hammond tells what he saw in a San Francisco opium den:  In a room not more than 20 feet square, down three stories underground, dimly lighted and dingy, where the air was so foul it almost overcame you as you stood in the entrance, I found 12 Chinamen busy at work.

Sitting flat on the floor, in the midst of indescribable -- indescribable filth, they were rolling cigarettes for the American boy to smoke." Correct so far?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And then the last paragraph says, "There was a great pile of material in one corner of the room, and we struck a match and stooped down to examine it.  We found it was cigar stumps and quids of tobacco, mixed with the vilest of sewer excretions."

Did I read all that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   And just so we're clear, this is 1906, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   This is before what you've told the jury was the introduction of the modern American blended cigarette in 1913, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  So these are -- this is before -- this isn't Marlboro we're talking about here, right?

A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  Nevertheless, they're saying that these cigarettes in the second and third lines are so generally inhaled, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Let me show you another Florida Health Notes. For the record, this is PMU 8917.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yeah, I just want to request --

give me one moment on that.  It took me a second on

the other one.  And if I can get a page that

precedes the other one.  I appreciate that.  It's

part of the cigarette (inaudible).

MR. GERAGHTY:  I think that may be all that I

have -- well, Page 2 -- it's Page 10 where that

appears.  I do not have the prior page.

MR. SCHULTZ:  All right.  What number are we

on, on the next one?

MR. GERAGHTY:  It is PMU8917. MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   This -- you've seen these Florida Health Notes before, right, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Excerpts, yes.

Q.   Here is another one.  Florida Health Notes, State Board of Health, September 1912, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And just -- I want to focus you on a passage, but I'm really focused on one little line out of this passage.  There's an article in here that says, "Public Decided for No Smoking," right?

A.   Right.  This is the discussion about the effort in Kansas, I believe.

Q.   Yeah.  They're talking about a -- an act to ban smoking publicly in Kansas City here, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And I've highlighted the passage that says, "There have always been quite a number of very decent people who could not understand why they should be forced to submit to the stench of 47 varieties of pipes, el cabbagoes, two-fors, coffin nails, et cetera, simply because a minority of smokers assume the right to pollute the air in this way."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   True.

Q.   And that reference -- that term "coffin nails" highlighted there is a reference to cigarettes, right?

A.   Probably.

Q.   Well --

A. We don't really know for sure. I don't know the writer, but I would suspect that.

Q. Doctor, you've seen this before, and haven't you agreed that this reference to "coffin nails" is a reference to cigarettes?

A.   Yeah, I said probably.

Q.   I mean, you have heard that if we go back over

100 years ago, people referred to cigarettes as coffin nails?

A.   Yeah, and other forms of tobacco as well, smoke tobacco.

Q.   And meaning every cigarette you smoke is another nail in your coffin?

A. True, but they're referring to -- there are many forms of smoked tobacco. Cigars being a common type, cigarettes another.

Q.   You know if we move forward in time, let's say the 1940s and '50s, that turn of the century term "coffin nail" comes back and is actually referenced in a lot of newspaper and magazines in the 1940s and 1950s, right?

A. Sure. And cigarettes at that time were the predominate form of tobacco. Not really true in the early part of the 20th century, though.

Q.   Let me move forward.  We're in this period of the early 1900s here, and we can go back 100 years, and there were home remedies designed to help people give up the use of tobacco, including cigars and cigarettes; isn't that right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   You're familiar with a catalogue from Sears & Roebuck, are you not?

A.   I am.

Q.   This is PMU48337.  And Sears & Roebuck is a department store, kind of like Walmart or Target, still exists but not quite as popular as it used to be many years ago?

A.   Right.  And they were well-known for their catalogue that people would order out of.

Q.   So it says, "Sears & Roebuck Company, Consumer's Guide, Fall 1900," right?

A.   Right.

Q.   And there's an ad in here that I want to focus your attention on.

Okay.  Everybody see that?  Yeah? Okay.  It says, "Sure cure for the tobacco habit," right, at the very top --

A.   Yes.

Q.   It's a little hard to read the actual thing here, but it says, "Tobacco to the dogs we cure you of all desire for tobacco sold only by Sears, Roebuck & Company," right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And it's a little tough to read, so bear with me, and if I trip over the words or I get any of them wrong, you just tell me.

So at the very top on the right-hand side it says, "This is nature's own remedy, entirely harmless. It cures because it builds up and fortifies, rejuvenates the weak and unstrung nerves, caused by overindulgence in this poisonous weed.  It stops the craving for tobacco by supplying instead" -- and then we come all the way over here to the left-hand column -- "by supplying instead a healthy nerve tonic and strengthener.

"It does more.  It eradicates the poisonous nicotine from the system which has accumulated from long, continued use of tobacco.  Nicotine is a virulent poison and the chief ingredient of tobacco.

"It is the cause of all the nervous troubles and general debility of smokers.  Our sure cure will destroy the effects of this nicotine, chase it from the system and make weak men strong again and impotent men gain weight and vigor, make the old feel young again?" Did I read all that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   But here we are, this is 1900.  This is an ad for a product that Sears & Roebuck is trying to sell to the American public, right?

A.   Yes.

virulent poison and the chief ingredient of tobacco."

A.   Yes.

Q.   And they're saying that in 1900?

A.   Yeah.  Nicotine is a poison, primarily used as an insecticide.

Q. Okay. Now, isn't it true that if we go back to 1915, that the Office of the Surgeon General referred to cigarette smoking as an addiction as far back as 1915?

A.   Yes, you can find that reference.

Q.   This is, for the record, PMU57443.  The first page is a little hard to make out, but I'll try to... It says, "Public Health Bulletin No. 71," at the top, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   May 1915 at the very top --

A.   Right.

Q.   -- "Studies in Vocational Disease, the Health of Garment Workers."

And then down here it says, "Prepared by Direction of the Surgeon General," correct?

A.   Right.  They were doing an occupational health study of garment workers.

Q.   Okay.  In 1915?

A.   Correct.

Page 28 where they're talking about cigarette smoking. And in 1915, the Surgeon General at that time writes the following:  "It is seen that cigarette smoking is by far the most popular form of tobacco addiction among male garment workers.  The kind of cigarettes most preferred by these workers were Turkish cigarettes."

A.   Yeah, because that was the predominant form of tobacco, single-blend Turkish tobacco, very low nicotine content prior to the blended cigarette, which came in, in 1913.

Q.   Okay.  But here's the Surgeon General in 1915 referring to the smoking of Turkish cigarettes as the predominant or most popular form of tobacco addiction among this group of male garment workers that they're studying?

A.   Right.  The switchover really hadn't happened. It didn't happen overnight.

In 1913, you had Camel.  1916, Lucky Strike was introduced.  The Chesterfield reformulated in 1918 creating the American-blended cigarette.  And single-blend cigarettes, like the Turkish blends, that these workers were predominantly using pretty much faded away as those brands began to dominate.

cigarettes being referenced here, this is before the modern American-blended cigarette you talked about has become very popular?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the Surgeon General is referring to the smoking of those particular types of cigarettes as an addiction?

A.   Yes, he said "most popular form of tobacco addiction among male garment workers," and he talks about the Turkish cigarettes and irregular heartbeats and so on which would be due to the carbon monoxide you get from inhaling cigarette smoke.

Q.   My question is, does the Surgeon General in 1915 refer to the smoking of these Turkish cigarettes as the most popular form of tobacco addiction?

A.   Yes, he does.

Q.   Now, the State of Florida actually banned the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in 1900, did it not?

A.   Correct, for a short period.

Q.   115 years ago, the State of Florida banned the manufacture and sale of cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it was a crime in this state to manufacture and sell cigarettes over a century ago?

manufacture and sell it, yeah.

Q.   Right.  And one of the reasons that the State of Florida banned the manufacture and sale of cigarettes over 100 years ago was concerns about the youth becoming addicted to cigarettes, right?

A.   That was one of the concerns among others.

Q.   Now, let's move forward in time.

And you're familiar with Reader's Digest magazine, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   In the 1930s and 1940s and 1950s Reader's Digest was the No. 1 selling magazine in the United States, was it not?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it went to hundreds of thousands of households here in the -- in the U.S.?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And it wasn't written for doctors or scientists?

A.   No.

Q.   It was written for the general public?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And so Reader's Digest used language that everybody could understand?

A.   True.

Q.   And back in the 1930s and 1940s and 1950s, Reader's Digest published articles about the reasons why people smoke cigarettes, right?

A.   There were articles you can find in Reader's Digest, a handful, less than 1 percent.  But, yes, you can find them.

Q.   Doctor, let me ask you this --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- the articles -- well, let me try again.

Reader's Digest, back in the 1930s and 1940s, published articles about the reasons why people smoked cigarettes, right?

A.   Among other topics.

Q.   Okay.  And the articles in Reader's Digest discuss the fact that the chief reason why people smoke cigarettes is because there is nicotine in cigarettes?

A.   You can find a reference -- I think the -- you know, in a couple of the articles to nicotine, yes.

Q.   Some of those articles refer to nicotine as a drug, right?

A.   Some of them do.

Q.   And some of the articles said that people could get addicted to nicotine in cigarettes, correct?

A.   Some of them do.

Q.   Now, let me show you one.  This is PMU2005.

This one is from 1935.  Let me show you the cover.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Wrong way.

So it says, "Reader's Digest" -- oops.  Let me go back.

"Reader's Digest Articles of Lasting Interest, February of 1935."

A.   Right.

Q.   So this is 18 years before Mr. Danielson is born, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   The article I want to you refer to is called "On Giving Up Smoking."

A.   Okay.

Q.   Can everybody see that okay?

So it says, "On Giving Up Smoking, condensed from PUNCH," right.

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And PUNCH is a British magazine?

A.   That's right.

Q. What Reader's Digest would often do is it would take articles that had been published in other magazines and kind of collect them, right?

A.   Sometimes.

Q.   Now, let's read what is said in Reader's Digest

in 1935.

"Of course, it is perfectly easy to give up smoking.  One would not like to think that one has become such a slave to tobacco that one cannot do without it, a drug which weakens the heart, damages the nerves, gives you cancer and catarrh and so on." Did I read that correctly so far?

A.   You did.

Q.   And then if we just drop down to the very first sentence in the next paragraph, it says, "The difficulty to my mind is not so much giving up smoking as going on giving it up," right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And then if we were to continue to read, this individual who writes the article talks about all the different methods that people have employed, at least as of that point in time, to try to quit smoking, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And so what he's really talking about in that last line where he says, "The difficulty to my mind is not so much giving up smoking as going on giving it up," is this concept of relapse that you've talked about over the course of yesterday and this morning, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And that's the same concept that Mark Twain was

A.   That's right.

Q.   Let me show you another one from 1938.  This is PMU2010, 2010.

So, again, Reader's Digest.  The date is August 1938.  This is 15 years before Mr. Danielson is born, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And this article is called "So You're Going to Stop Smoking?"

See that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   This one says it's condensed up from Your Life. The author is Henry C. Link, Ph.D., right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Can everybody read this okay?

So here the first paragraph says, "Sooner or later, nearly every cigarette smoker discovers that he is not smoking by choice but by habit, and the habit probably harmful.  So he tries to break free from it, but finds that he doesn't know how.  Sometimes halfheartedly, sometimes earnestly he wrestles with his addiction, but in vain.  His self-control has been perilously undermined by a mere mechanism of habit." So have I read it correctly so far?

A.   That's right.

Q.   So, again, he's talking about the struggle that people have to quit smoking, right?

A.   Right.  People figure out it's hard to stop.

Q.   And in the same paragraph -- in this very same paragraph he refers to cigarette smoking as both a habit and an addiction?

A.   True.

Q.   What we talked about earlier, how people often would use those terms interchangeably during these periods of time?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Let's move on into the 1940s. (Pause.)

I'm going to show you one from 1941. This is PMU2016. So you see at the bottom it says the date is December of 1941, right?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   So this is a little less than 12 years before Mr. Danielson is born, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And I want to show you this article.  This article is called Nicotine Knockout, or the Slow Count, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And we'll kind of highlight and go down.  So it's written by Gene Tunney, correct?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And at one point Gene Tunney had been the heavyweight boxing champion of the world, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   But in 1941 when he writes this article it says here right under his name, former heavyweight boxing champion of the world, Lieutenant Commander USNR, U.S. Naval Reserve, now in charge of navy physical training and athletics, right?

A.   That's right.

Q. And when he writes and publishers this article in 1941, the current heavyweight champion is a man -- a very good boxer by the name of Joe Louis, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And Gene Tunney jokes -- in the beginning of the article he says, you know what, I'll come out of retirement, I'll challenge Joe Louis and I'll beat Joe Louis if he will smoke cigarettes, because I think then I'll be able to beat him.

But he goes on to say, of course, Joe wouldn't be so silly as to do that.

A.   Actually Joe Louis was featured in cigarette advertising at the time.  So he was actually hired by

tobacco companies to market their brands.

Q.   All right.  I understand your point, Dr. Cummings, but my question is isn't that what --

A.   That's what he says.

Q.   That's what he says in the article.  Okay. Let's see exactly what he says.

We're going to drop down here.  This is the article.  It says "with every puff" -- can everybody see this okay?

"With every puff heavy smokers shorten their own lives.  Dr. Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins found that among 100,000 heavy (over 10 cigarettes a day) smokers, 53,774 die before the age of 60."

Dropping down a sentence it says, "'Smoking,' he announced, 'is associated with definite impairment of longevity.'"

And then Gene Tunney goes on to say "The cause of most of the trouble is, of course, nicotine. No one has ever denied that nicotine is poison," right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And then down at the bottom it says, "This powerful poison is the source of all the 'pleasure,'" and that's in quotes -- "derived from smoking.  It touches off the mechanism by which the adrenal glands release quick energy from the liver and muscles.  You do

get a 'lift' when you light a cigarette.  But it's exactly like the lift you get from cocaine, heroin, marijuana."

That's all being said in a Reader's Digest article in 1941?

A.   That's right.

Q. Now, let's move forward and let's move into the 1950s. Just one or two more of these articles, and I'll be really quick about these with you, Dr. Cummings.

As we continue into the 1950s, there continues to be articles written in lay press talking about cigarettes being harmful and causing cancer, including Reader's Digest, right?

A.   True.

Q.   Let me show you -- this is PMU2031. 2031. And the date here is January 1950, right?

A.   That's right.

Q. The article is "How Harmful Are Cigarettes?" by Roger William Riis?

A.   Right.

Q.   Just -- I wanted to highlight a passage here. This is in 1950.  And it says, "Nicotine is the essential ingredient of tobacco.  It is what makes tobacco tobacco and not just another weed," right?

Q.

	I'11 keep moving

forward.
	
	


	The last one I want to show

Q.

risks of smoking in this period of the late 1940s and early 1950s, right?

A.   True.

Q.   As we move into the early 1950s, major news publications in the United States, Time, Life, Newsweek, carry articles that discuss the health risks of smoking, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   During this period of time, you actually showed some articles that go back further in time.  Some German articles, some Argentinian articles.  But during the same period of time, in the early 1950s, there are some scientific studies being done here in the United States and, at the same time, over in England that specifically link cigarette smoking with lung cancer, correct?

A.   Yeah, I think I mentioned there were five articles that came out the '49, '50 period in major medical journals, and then later the mouse painting experiments by Dr. Wynder -- Wynder, Graham, and Croninger that came out in Cancer Research.  And those did get widely covered, some of which is summarized in Reader's Digest and other magazines.  And I think I mentioned LIFE magazine coverage of, you know, Dr. Wynder's mouse painting experiments in December of 1953.

Q.   And you anticipated exactly where I was going. So one of the most famous studies that was done was this mouse skin painting study by Dr. Evarts, Dr. Graham and Adele -- excuse me, Dr. Graham, Dr. Wynder and Adele Croninger, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And I think you showed an excerpt or a slide that kind of referred to that particular study, but as you said a moment ago, that study received tremendous amount of attention in the lay press and was actually featured in an article in LIFE magazine?

A.   Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And, Your Honor, for the record,

it's PMU2059. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   We had been talking about Reader's Digest but let's just shift gears for a second and talk about LIFE.

So on the bottom here it says December 21st, 1953, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And LIFE was one of the most popular magazines at the time, right?

A. Sure. And it was a pictorial magazine so it was large and often had colored advertisements in it, and the cover, of course.  This one is Canasta pajamas,

I think.

Q.   Right.  And so they actually devote an article to the research being done by Dr. Graham and Dr. Wynder and had photographs of them that kind of depict how they conducted the study, right?

A.   They do.  There's two pages, I think, on the middle.  If you turn to the middle --

Q.   Yeah.

A.   -- sort of cover section, they've got the pictures of their research and a brief article on it.

Q.   And with your help, I'm going to ask you -- I'm going to ask you to kind of help me orient everybody here.

So let's just talk about the study they did. This is -- the -- the top photograph is Dr. Graham, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And they were at the Washington University, right, in St. Louis, Missouri?

A.   That's right.  Dr. Wynder was a medical resident at the time, and he had done the research on lung cancer.  I think he published a paper in 1950.  And his mentor was Dr. Graham.

And he had been a skeptic about the link between smoking and lung cancer, but you have a picture

of him there standing in front of all those cigarettes. That was sort of the cigarette smoking machine they created that would collect up the tar.

Dr. Croninger, who was often forgotten as the third author, but she did a lot of the experiments.  She would collect up the tar --

Q.   Let me just pause you, sir.

A.   Sure.

Q.   So Dr. Graham is standing behind the smoking machine, right?

A.   That's right.

Q. So they've got dozens and dozens of cigarettes that are being smoked and they're collecting the -- the tar in these vessels here?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Down at the bottom you have Adele Croninger and she's got the tar in these flasks, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Then they took that condensed tar, and then the tar is the condensed smoke basically?

A.   That's right.  It's the particulate matter is what --

Q. They shave the backs of these mice and then they painted that tar, that condensed smoke onto the back of the mice, right?

A.   They did.  And in some of the other mice they used saline so they had a control.  You could have used other things, but when you paint tobacco tar you get tumors, and that's what they were showing.  And the more tar, the more tumors.

Q.   Right.  And that's the last photograph on the bottom on the far right.  Those are the backs of the mice that had developed tumors because they had had the condensed smoke, the tar painted on their backs, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And this was in December of 1953?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And the results of this experiment published in LIFE, and other experiments around the same period of time, other studies are being published in newspapers and magazines across the United States, right?

A.   Sure.  I mean, the public information, there are many other studies coming out.  As I said, in the '50s in particular there were many studies coming out on the health risks of smoking.

Wynder's study got a lot of publicity but there are actually many studies predating Wynder on mouse painting and animal painting experiments.  Dr. Roffo, I mentioned yesterday.

Q.   My question, though, is this study and other

studies that were coming out in the United States around the same period of time, 1951, 1952, 1953, received a tremendous amount of publicity in newspapers and magazines here, correct?

A.   Increasingly over time, yes.  And this one was the study that was published in June of 1953 in the Journal of Cancer Research.

Q.   And this article, this is all coming out right around the time that Lamar Danielson is born in October of 1953, correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   And six months after this LIFE magazine article is published in June of 1954, virtually everyone in this country had heard -- had heard that cigarette smoking could cause lung cancer, correct?

A.   They had heard that, yes.

Q.   Right.  There was a poll that was conducted and that poll found that 90 percent of the people had heard about recent studies that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer, correct?

A.   Sure.  They had heard there had been studies done.  And that's not surprising, given the fact that there were even -- there were full-page front page ads put out by the cigarette companies referencing the mouse painting, called the Frank Statement, that had came out

in between.  So people were hearing about it, but...

Q.   Let me -- my question simply was there was a poll --

A.   Yes.

Q.   -- that was conducted in June of 1954 that found that 90 percent of the people polled had heard about recent studies that cigarette smoking was a cause of lung cancer, correct?

A.   True.  Gallup poll.

Q.   Now, let's move forward in time, and you actually referred to this program called "See It Now," right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the host of the program was a man named Edward R. Murrow, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And he was an extremely famous journalist because he had been a World War II correspondent stationed over in Great Britain, right?

A.   During the blitzkrieg, yeah.

Q. When the Germans were bombing London, Edward R. Murrow would report every day and those reports would be picked up on radio and people listened to those reports, right?

A.   True.

Q.   After the war he does a lot of things, but one of them is he has this program called See It Now, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And it was a primetime show I think that you said it was similar to today what we would call 60 Minutes?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And it ran a two-day special program about cigarette smoking and health, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you showed two clips, if I'm remembering correctly, right?

A. Yeah, I think we showed Mr. Hartnett, who was the president of Brown & Williamson, later chairman of TIRC; and then another clip of Dr. Clarence Cook Little.

Q.   Okay.  Now, you know that the bulk of that program, the See It Now program, was devoted to telling the American public about the evidence that had accumulated up to that point that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, right?

A.   Sure.  I wouldn't say the bulk.  I mean, there were -- they had both sides that presented their position and -- but they did present.  And I think I mentioned Cuyler Hammond, and I might have mentioned somebody from the National Cancer Institute appeared on

A.   Clarence Cook Little.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, we'd like to show --BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.    There were other people who appeared on that program, right?

A.   Yes.  I named some of them.  Dr. Wynder appeared.  They had Cuyler Hammond from the American Cancer Society who appeared on the show.  I believe there was a doctor from the National Cancer Institute who appeared.  Somebody from the AMA appeared.

MR. GERAGHTY:  So let's show -- Your Honor, we

have a clip from that same program that was showed

earlier.  The first one is Dr. Wynder.  It's

smoking machine that led to their findings.

MALE SPEAKER:  The machine puffs every 80 seconds a two-second puff and the volume of the puff is about the same as the conduit in (inaudible).

In this machine, the temperature of the burning cigarettes are quite the same as that encountered in human smoking habits.

The machine puffs and the smoke is drawn into flasks, which are immersed into dry ice.  The smoke, therefore, is being condensed, and the tar is on the (inaudible).

And this bottle contain the amount of tar to which the average heavy cigarette smoker is exposed to over a given year's period of time.

FEMALE SPEAKER:  These animals were painted three times a week with the cigarette solution. What we noticed in our original experiment was after about eight months, these animals first lost the hair on the painted area, and then little warts or papillomas as we call them appeared.  These are precancerous lesions.

And in the eleventh month of painting, we had our first cancer.  (Inaudible) invite you to look at an early cancer on the back of the mouse, painted, of course, with cigarette tar.

BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   So that was Dr. Ernst Wynder and Adele Croninger on video on that television show See It Now explaining the mouse skin painting study we talked about earlier?

A.   That's right.

Q. You also mentioned that Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond from the American Cancer Society also appeared on that See It Now program?

A. That's right. The Cancer Society had initiated a study in 1951, I believe, and they began to report out their results in 1955.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And if we could, Your Honor,

we'd like to show that clip from the same program.

the first two years.

MALE SPEAKER:  It is now established in my

opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that cigarette

smoking greatly increases the possibility of

developing lung cancer.  In my opinion, people

should be warned of the danger and they are being

warned.  What they, then, want to do, whether they

wish to smoke or not, is their own business.

BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   That's Dr. E Cuyler Hammond.  At the time he is on a program in 1955.  He's with the American Cancer Society, right?

A.   Right.  He was also at Yale University, a statistician there, yeah.

Q.   And so he's saying people should be warned and they are being warned.  He continues to work on this American Cancer Society -- American Cancer Society study that you've talked about, right?  And they ultimately release the results of that study in about 1957, right?

A.   Well, they released some of the early findings because they were so striking because almost all the studies up to that point had been retrospective, identifying cancer patients versus controls and then

asking them about their smoking histories.

What Dr. Hammond did was a prospective study, where they ask people about their smoking habits and then they just waited.  They followed those individuals to see who would develop disease, and I believe they reported their findings out at a medical meeting in the mid 1950s; and then they later published their results -- the end of those results.  I think you're mentioning '57.  There were also the pathologist studies coming out at that time as well.

Q.   And they found a very, very high correlation between cigarette smoking and lung cancer and other diseases?

A.   Yes.  These compilation of findings coming out at that time is exactly what led Leroy Burney, who was then the Surgeon General of the United States, to conclude that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.

Q.   And I think you've said earlier today -- you mentioned that earlier today.  I think you said he made that statement in 1957?

A.   Yes.  July of 1957.  Responding to the joint --there's the joint agency report that came out from researchers at the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, other health organizations, plus independent scientists who put out a joint

Q.   And we also know that that same year, 1957, Lamar Danielson's father, Norman Danielson, quit smoking at the age of 35, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, let's move forward to the 1960s.

And you talked about the release of the first Surgeon General's Report in January of 1964, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   And President Kennedy is asked about the Royal College of Physicians Report, which was a report published in 1962 in England that concluded that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And so he's asked about it and as a result of that, he goes to the Surgeon General Luther Terry and he says, hey, you know, we need to have our own report in which we, the United States, come to our own conclusion about whether cigarette smoking causes disease.

And in response to that, the Surgeon General, Luther Terry, convenes or puts together a blue ribbon panel of ten medical experts, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And they ultimately publish the first Surgeon General's Report in January of 1964, right?

Q.   This particular article?

A.   I probably have.

Q.   You probably have?

A.   Yeah, from other trials that I've done here.

Q.   Now, let me -- let me just ask you this:  I think you talked about the fact in the same report that we're talking about here where the Surgeon General concluded that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, there is a -- a chapter or discussion about whether or not cigarette smoking should be more properly labeled an addiction or an habituation, right?  There's that discussion?

A.   I don't recall that.  I don't deny it's there, but I don't recall that specifically.

Q.   You don't recall that that was actually discussed in the '64 Surgeon General's Report?

A.   Oh, in the report.  I thought you were

referring to this newspaper article.

Q.   I'm sorry, let me -- just to be clear --

A.   Sure.

Q.   --I'm talking about in the report.  The 1964 report has a chapter in it where the Surgeon General talks about whether or not cigarette smoking should be better properly labeled or characterized as an addictive behavior or a habituation, I guess.

A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  And let's take a look, though -- have you read this whole article?

A.   At one time I had.

Q.   Okay.

A.   I don't know if I've memorized it, but...

Q.   There's actually a reference to that section of the report in the article itself.

A.   Okay.

Q.   This is in the body of the article.  Let me just... this is the -- continued from Page 1-A.  It says, "U.S. health report claims smoking linked to cancer."

Right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Continued from Page 1-A?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And then if we go to this passage I've highlighted, it says, "Speaking on the subject of the tobacco habit and nicotine, the panel reported, quote, 'The habitual use of tobacco is related primarily to psychological and social drives, reinforced and perpetuated by the pharmacological drug actions of nicotine.'"

Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  So the idea that nicotine had reinforcing pharmacological effects was no secret in 1964, was it?

A.   No.  It's discussed in the report so it's not a secret in terms of the pharmacologic effects of nicotine.  Now, whether it's the primary factor of why people persist in smoking, that was not the conclusion of the report based on the evidence that the advisory committee had at their disposal.

Q.   Well, let's talk about that for just a minute, then.

A.   Sure.

Q. When the Surgeon General said, "We believe that more appropriately cigarette smoking should be called an habituation rather than an addiction," they made it very clear in that report that they were not trying to

suggest, by any means, that that means that it is easy for people to quit smoking cigarettes, right?

A.   No.  They didn't suggest that it was easy to quit.

Q.   All right.  They actually made that very clear that we're not trying to suggest this makes it easy to quit.  People struggle to quit, right?

A.   I would agree with that.

Q.   And they also, then, discuss the fact that the prevailing definition of "addiction" at that time, the one the Surgeon General used in 1964, required for a drug to be considered an addictive drug that it be intoxicating -- that it caused intoxication, right?

A.   Well, they, you know, were looking for a criteria to use.  So they didn't have the opportunity to look at the criteria the cigarette companies had used, like the Battelle report.  But they ended up using the World Health Organization criteria which, at that time, required that the -- to be classified as "addictive," a drug had to cause intoxication.

Q.   Right.

A.   And �

Q.   And �

A.   -- nicotine does not, nor does many addictive drugs today, fit that criteria.  And that definition

changed shortly after.

Q.   Right.  But I think you alluded to the point I'm trying to make, which is given the definition, that World Health Organization definition that the Surgeon General was using in its '64 report, cigarette smoking and nicotine did not meet the definition of an addictive drug because it didn't cause intoxication?

A.   Sure.  That's what they said based on the evidence that they had available to them.

Q.   But they still referred to it as a drug.  They recognized that it was a drug --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- and in the chapter where they discussed this whole issue of whether they should call it "addictive" or "habituating," they compared it to all sorts of drugs, like barbiturates, cocaine, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   Alcohol?

A.   That's right.

Q.   All those things?

A.   Barbiturates, for example, wouldn't be considered addictive under the definition that was used because it doesn't cause intoxication, given that barbiturates are clearly addictive.  And, yes, they did those comparisons within the chapter.

Q.   Now, the Surgeon General's Report in January of 1964 was also the lead news story on Nightly News that day, right?

A.   That is true.

Q.   And I think you may have said this, but there were only three television stations:  ABC, NBC, and CBS, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And each one of those television stations carried a special program that was devoted specifically to the results of the Surgeon General's Report, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And I believe you showed a clip from the CBS program, right?

A.   Right.  Howard Cullman.

Q.   You showed Mr. Howard Cullman from Philip Morris in a clip.  But would you agree with me that the overwhelming majority of that program, 75, 80, 90 percent of that program was devoted to telling the American public about the results of the Surgeon General's Report?

A.   Yeah, I would say the majority.  I don't know what percentage.  But all the networks had a spokesperson for the industry appear.  But, yeah, they were reporting out the Surgeon General's Report, and it

General's Committee had concluded.

Q.   And the CBS news program -- we're going to show

a clip here in a minute.

A.   Sure.

Q.   The anchor on CBS News at that point was a man

by the name of Harry Reasoner, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Let's take a look at what Harry Reasoner said

during the course of that program in January of 1964.

A.   Correct.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is PMU0572.

THE COURT:  Any objection?

MR. SCHULTZ:  No, Your Honor.

(A video clip was played and transcribed by the court

reporter to the best of his ability as follows:)

* * * *

MALE SPEAKER: This is a CBS News extra on smoking and health, the findings of the Surgeon General committee.

MR. REASONER:  Almost from the moment that cigarettes were introduced, they were attacked.  But the attacks are the new term ten years ago and culminated in today's report by the Surgeon General's Committee.

This, in summary, is what the committee says: Cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer in men, and data on women smokers points the same way. Cigarette smoking is a significant cause of cancer of the lungs and probably the most important cause of bronchitis.  Cigarette smoking may be related to other lung diseases.

Male smokers have a much higher death rate from heart disease, although it's not proven that smoking is the cause.  On the question of filters, the committee says there is no evidence that they do any good, but it didn't exclude the possibility that a filter might be developed.

In short, the committee says, "If you smoke cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying early.  The sooner you start, the more you smoke, the more you inhale, the worse your cancers are."

Above all, every American who smokes and every American youngster who is thinking of smoking must now consider whether to stop or not to start.  It comes down to a subjective question.  There is no question of what smoking has meant a great deal to a great many people.  An old smoker never forgets how he started.  And through the lifetimes of a lot of us, cigarettes have been an intimate and reassuring

The familiar slogans, the familiar packages have been a part of our lives.  It's like being told that an old friend has all along been betraying you. In a case like that, you give the old friend every possible chance before you finally decide to believe what you have been told and maybe even then to give him a chance to reform.  In this kind of a country, it comes down to you, whether you like it or not. No one is going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite clear that no one is going to tell him it's good for him either.  The decision is his.  The decision and the health that they depend on.

This is Harry Reasoner.  Good night.

BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   So that's Harry Reasoner, January 1964, saying, "The decision is his.  The decision and the health that they depend on it," right?

A.   Well, that's what he said, but the decision, based on my research, really rests with the company because they could have engineered their product so it wouldn't be addictive.

strike his answer as nonresponsive.

THE COURT:  With regard to the question that

was asked, the answer went beyond answering the

question directly, and I will grant the motion and

strike the portion that said that "the decision,

based on my research, really rests with the company

because they could have engineered their product so

it wouldn't be addictive."

And I would simply direct the jury to disregard

that because it was nonresponsive to the question

asked.  Thank you. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, you've described the 1964 report we've been talking about as historic in that it really changed people's views about cigarette smoking and health and helped lead the changes in smoking behavior and reduction in disease caused by tobacco use, have you not?

A.   Yes.

Q. And at this point in time -- we're talking 1964 -- millions of Americans are quitting smoking, right?

A.   True.

have quit smoking over time, are you not?
	
A.
	Quite familiar with it.

Q.
	Okay.  You know that according to the Surgeon

General
	r 17 million smokers had quit smoking by 1965,

right?
	

A.

	One year after 19- -- well, let's stick with

1965 here for a second.
	
A.
	Sure.

Q.
	In 1965, Congress passes a law that requires

warning
	labels to be put on every pack of cigarettes

sold in
	the United States, right?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	The law that Congress passed told Philip Morris

and the
	other cigarette companies what the labels should

say, right?
	
A.
	That's the law that was passed by Congress,

true.
	

Q.
	And the law told the companies exactly where on

the package the warnings should be placed, right?
	
A.
	That's right.

Q.   Good afternoon again, Dr. Cummings.

A.   Good afternoon.

Q.   Before we took the break we were in 1965.  We had just talked about the Surgeon General's Report of 1964.  We showed the coverage from CBS News and Harry Reasoner.  We've talked about Congress passing a law requiring the very first warning label.  And let me publish that, please.

So this is the language, Dr. Cummings, of the first warning label that started appearing on all packs of cigarettes in 1966.  "Caution:  Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health," right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And that began to appear on packs of cigarettes sold here in the United States beginning in January of 1966?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And Lamar Danielson would have been 12 years old at that point in time, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you talked about an FTC report from 1967. Do you recall that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And in the four-year period from 1966 when those warning labels first started to appear and 1970,

13 million smokers quit smoking in the United States, right?

A.   That's true.  Due to The Fairness Doctrine period, the PSAs, not the warning labels.

Q. Doctor, my question simply is: Between 1966 when this warning first appeared and 1970, 13 million Americans quit smoking in this country, correct?

A.   Sure.  I can explain why.

Q.   Now, let's move forward to 1970.

The jury has heard this, but in 1970 the language of the warning label changes, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   There's a new warning label.

And the warning as of January 1970 says, "Warning:  The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health," right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And, again, this begins to appear on all packs of cigarettes beginning in January of 1970?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Lamar Danielson would have been 16 and going to turn 17 in the year of 1970, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   As of January 1st, 1971, a year later, I think you talked about this, but all cigarette advertising is

banned in the United States, taken off of television and radio, right?

A.   Right, beginning January 2nd.

Q.   Right.  And then one year later, in 1972, every print advertisement in a newspaper or magazine or in a billboard is required to carry this Surgeon General's warning (indicating) on the ad itself, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And that's been the -- the case ever since 1972, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Now, during the same period of time, the late 1960s, you talked, I believe it was yesterday, about public service announcements that are beginning to be aired on television and radio here in the United States that talk about the health risks of smoking and are delivering the message people should quit smoking, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you mentioned that they were sponsored by organizations like the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, organizations like that, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you've seen many of those public service

announcements, haven't you, that have aired in this country in the '60s and '70s and '80s, right?

A.   Yes, I have.

Q.   You've talked about several of them yesterday, right?

A.   I did.

Q.   I want to show PMU2295.

And this is a video of a public service announcement by a man named Bill Talman.

You know who Bill Talman is, right?

A.   Sure.  He was the district attorney who lost all those cases to Perry Mason in the Perry Mason show, and he did a public service ad for the American Cancer Society that got played because of The Fairness Doctrine beginning in 1968, which accounts for why smoking rates declined.

Q.   Let me set the stage, then.

Perry Mason was a very popular lawyer television show, right?

A.   Sponsored by Philip Morris.

Q.   Okay.  My question is:  Was it a very popular television show?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  And Perry Mason was played by Raymond Burr?

A.
	Correct.
	

Q.
	He was the defense attorney?
	

A.
	Well, yes.
	

Q.
	And Bill Talman, as you said, was the
	
prosecutor, the district attorney?
		

A.
	That's right.
	

Q.
	And in almost every single episode
	Raymond Burr

somehow,
	through some courtroom brilliance,
	figured out

how to win the case at the 11th hour and 59th minute,
		
right?
	
	

A.
	Yes.  I don't think he ever lost is
	my

recollec
	tion.
	

Q.
	I believe there might have been one
	or two

episodes
	where he did, in fact, lose; but it
	was a rare

occasion
	�
	


	But Bill Talman was almost always the loser of
	
the cour
	troom battles he had with Raymond Bu
	rr, right?

A.
	That's right.
	

Q.
	And so that's kind of the stage of
	the public

service
	announcement we're about to show?
	

A.
	Yeah.  Don't Be a Loser I think was
	the title

of the ad.
		

Q.
	If we can show PMU2295. This is from 1968, right?
	

A.
	'67 to '68 I think is when it began
	to air.

And that's me, Bill Talman, with a friend of mine you might recognize.

You know, I don't really mind losing those courtroom battles, but I'm at a battle right now I don't want to lose it all because, if I lose it, it means losing my life and those kids you just met.

I've got lung cancer.  So take some advice about smoking and losing from someone who has been doing both for years.  If you don't smoke, don't start.  If you do smoke, quit.  Don't be a loser.

A.   I think he made the ad in '67.  The ad aired in 1968, and he died in 1968.

Q. You talked about Larry Hagman. He's famous. He was in two television sitcoms, right? He was in I Dream of Jeannie first?

A.   Yes.

Q.   He was a lieutenant in the Air Force.  And then later on he plays probably one of the most famous villains at that point in time on Dallas, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And he was in a public service announcement in 1981?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And the joke there is in 1981 he's playing J.R. Ewing and J.R. Ewing is not really such a nice guy on television.  Is he?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Let me show you one more.  You mentioned Yul Brynner.  He also did a very famous public service announcement, obviously shot before he passed away; but ultimately aired after he had passed away; isn't that right?

commercial when I discovered it was not safe, and my

time was so limited to make a commercial that says

simply, "I tell you don't smoke, tell you to just

don't smoke."  If I could take back that smoking, we

wouldn't be talking about any cancer, I'm convinced

of that.

A.   Yes, they are.

Q.   And they ran during this period of time we've been talking about in the 1960s and 1970s, and we showed some from the 1980s, right?

Q.   Now, in 1979, the Surgeon General's determined that 30 million people had quit smoking between 1964, when that very first Surgeon General's Report was released, and 1979, correct?

Q.   And so that's a 15-year period.  And for roughly that 15-year period, that's 2 million people quitting smoking every single year on average?

A.   Yeah, classified as "former smokers."  You have to understand how they came up with that statistic.  I can explain it if you'd like.

Q.   Well, the Surgeon General referred to this period we've been talking about as an era of unprecedented quitting in this country, correct?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And during that same period of time, you told the jury that Philip Morris was making statements that -- and the Tobacco Institute, they were making statements that it had not been proven that cigarette smoking causes disease, correct?

A.   That's what they were saying, yes.

Q.   Nevertheless, during this same 15-year period, 30 million Americans were reported as having quit smoking by the Surgeon General?

A.   That's true.

Q.   Now, let me just do this real quick.

You showed this chart or graph, I guess, if you will.  It was per capita cigarette consumption.  You showed this several times during your examination.  Do you recall that?

A.   I do.

Q.   Can everybody see that okay?

So this is -- this is one of the ones you showed with Mr. Schultz, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And this is per capita cigarette consumption. It's the number of cigarettes smoked divided by the number of people in the country, adult people, right?

A.   18 and older.

Q.   Right.  And your chart shows that the very peak, and I think you said this several times, the peak is in 1964, right?  That's the peak that -- I've marked it with my pen.

A.   It was the peak.  It got very close in 1966 --

Okay.

-- after the warnings appears.

And we can trace it.  But, I mean, I've

highlighted it.  We can just trace the line.

A.   Sure.

Q.   We can follow this line, and it is gradually going down, and we have -- I think this little faint line is 1990 here.  So this is somewhere around the late 1990s; is that right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And per capita cigarette consumption was

less -- or, excuse me, greater in 1960 than it was in 1970, right?

A.   True.

Q.   And cigarette -- per capita cigarette consumption was less in 1980 than it was in 1970, right?

A.   That's true.

Q.   Per capita cigarette consumption was less in 1990 than it was in 1980, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And per capita cigarette consumption was less in 2000 than it was in 1990?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And while we haven't extended it all the way out, if we extended it all the way out to 2014 or 2015, the per capita cigarette consumption today would be somewhere in this vicinity of where we were between 1930 and 1940 during the period that we call the Great Depression; is that fair?

A.   Yeah, sometime between '30 and '40, that's true.

Q.   Okay.

A.   I wouldn't say it's at the levels they were at the Depression, but they're getting closer to that.

Q.   Okay.  Now, let's switch gears completely and let's talk about Lamar Danielson.

A.   Okay.

Q.   You -- you obviously never had a chance to meet or speak to Lamar Danielson, right?

A.   No, unfortunately, that's true.

Q.   You haven't spoken to Mrs. Danielson about this case other than meeting her since you arrived here in Pensacola, correct?

A.   That's true.

Q. And you've never met or talked with any member of the Danielson family about this case, right?

A.   Not about the case.  I've met them.

Q. And you never had -- you never spoke to any of Lamar Danielson doctors?

A.   No.

Q. So to form the opinions that you told us about yesterday that you have in this case, you were provided written materials by Mrs. Danielson's lawyers, right?

A.   Correct.  I think I mentioned the review of 21 depositions.  I think that was over 15 different people, coworkers, friends, family of Mr. Danielson's, interrogatories, medical records, other material as well.  I think there was some insurance material and some other material as well.  I think that came from Philip Morris.

Q.   Right.  So you read, for example, depositions

of Mrs. Danielson and family members and friends of --and coworkers of Mr. Danielson, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   You read medical records that had been collected where -- written by the doctors who treated Lamar Danielson, right?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And I think you just mentioned a moment ago you reviewed insurance records and other records that we have available to us from Mr. Danielson or that had been filled out by Mr. Danielson, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   All right.  So Mr. Danielson, you talked about when he started smoking, but he -- he started smoking during this period of time that we had just been talking about for the most part, right?

A.   Right.  Best indications are in the late 1960s, around '67, '68.

Q.   Okay.  We're going to talk about that in a minute here.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Let's start with before Mr. Danielson himself is actually starting to smoke.

A.   Okay.

Q.   His parents, Myrtle Danielson and Norman

Danielson, are opposed to smoking and drinking, right?

A.   I think there is some testimony.  I don't think they talked to their kids about smoking, as I recall.

Q.   Well, my question simply is, his parents were opposed to smoking and drinking, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Okay.  You know that his mother, Myrtle Danielson, was described as a very strict Baptist woman, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And that she was strongly opposed to both smoking and drinking?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Lamar Danielson's son, Billy Danielson, described his grandparents, his father's parents, as being very strict, did he not?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Lamar Danielson's mother was described as a force to be reckoned with, correct?

A.   Yes, as most mothers are.

Q.   Right.  And Mr. Danielson's father, Norman Danielson or Swede Danielson, as he was called, was a funeral home director and an embalmer for many years, correct?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And he was, as we talked about earlier, a cigarette smoker himself?

A.   Yes, he had been.

Q.   And we can go back to when he was a teenager and Norman Danielson, Sr. was caught smoking cigarettes by his grandmother, he was whooped by his father, and he was told by his grandmother that cigarette smoking is bad for you?

A.   He may have said those things.  That's not what I focused on in my review.  So if you'd like to show specifics, I'd be happy to, if you want to go through it --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, we would also object

on relevance, unless they establish the predicate of

this, what's announced is established to make this

relevant.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  He says he doesn't

recall that specific thing, as I understand it.  I

mean, that's his answer.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Right.  Okay. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   You read the deposition of Norman Danielson, right?

A.   Sure.  I read the depositions focusing on Lamar Danielson's smoking behavior so I could do a proper

assessment as to whether he was addicted or not based on my assessments.

Q.   Well, did you read all the depositions, or did you not read all the depositions?

A.   I said I read them all.

Q.   Okay.  And do you recall that -- I mean, you gave a deposition in this case, didn't you?

A.   I did.  I have it here.

Q.   And isn't it true that you have read that passage of the deposition where Mr. Danielson, Sr., Norman Danielson, Sr., said he got whipped by his father when he was caught smoking as a teenager himself?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Judge, same objection I just

lodged.

THE COURT:  The objection is sustained.  Thank

you.

Move on. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Now, if we move forward to 1957, in 1957, when Norman Danielson, Sr. is 35 years old, and his son, Lamar Danielson, is only three or four years old, he quit smoking because his wife did not want him to smoke or drink, right?

A.   I'm not sure the reasons.  I just recall that he did stop smoking in the late '50s.  That's my

recollection of the testimony.

Q.   Right.  Mr. Danielson, Sr. said that his wife did not want him to smoke cigarettes.

A.   I don't dispute that.  I just don't recall the actual text.  I'd be happy to look at it to refresh my memory.  I didn't look at the text for those reasons.

Q.   Well, I'm happy to show it to --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- Dr. Cummings --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I have the

depositions here.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, we'd have the same

objection, unless there was some communication with

Mr. Danielson.

THE COURT:  I would sustain unless there was

some communication. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Well, do you think Lamar Danielson didn't know that his father smoked cigarettes and eventually quit?

A.   I think he -- I don't know what he knew.  He was three or four, based on my read of the deposition, as to when he -- his father quit smoking.

Q.   His older brother, Ray Danielson, was aware that his father smoked cigarettes and quit in 1957 at the urging of his mother, right?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, same objection unless --

THE COURT:  Approach the bench, please. Approach the bench.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

THE COURT:  You're just asking him to speculate, and I'm going to sustain the objection unless you can show me that evidence that he would know about it.  He did know about it.  Where is that evidence?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, Your Honor, you're saying -- I'm not asking Dr. Cummings to speculate about anything.  I'm asking him about depositions that he read in this case that formed the foundation and the basis for all of his decisions.  He's got a report where he lists out every single deposition he read, and he took notes from every single one of those depositions.

They have asked him broad, sweeping opinions not only about addiction but also about if things that the cigarette companies said that there was no foundation that Lamar Danielson ever saw, whether those affected him, influenced him, whether he was surrounded by this message.  I have to be permitted

to do the same exact thing.

Mr. Schultz has opened the door to this, and I can cite Your Honor cases where -- Kelly versus State Farm, 720 So. 2d 1145.  I have the cases here. That's a Fifth District Court of Appeal case from 1988.  He can't give this witness material and then say, "Read these materials; arrive at broad, sweeping opinions," and then prevent me from exploring with him the basis of those opinions and the materials that he reviewed, and that's exactly what Mr. Schultz is trying to do.

I am not asking this witness to speculate about anything.  I'm asking him to agree with me about the factual basis, the factual predicate supporting the very sweeping opinions that he's offered already today, and I'm entitled to do that under 9702 and 9703.

THE COURT:  There's an order that has been entered by me based upon a motion filed by the plaintiff.  I guess maybe it was entered by Judge Bell.  But that order says that testimony regarding other family members' smoking is not going to be admitted unless it's something that was said in the presence of the decedent or he -- there was evidence that he knew about it.

And so this is -- you know, we can't fly in with that order in limine and you arguing that, "well, anything he read, no matter if it violates any order in limine that you entered, should be allowed in evidence," because he happened to read it during the course of his presentation.

That's just not going to happen.  I mean, it's -- there's no way that that information can be backdoored on the guise of, "well, that's something he happened to have read, and he's on the stand and we can ask him about anything he read."

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, I would say, number one, they've opened the door; and, number two, I think it's a reasonable inference that Lamar Danielson knew that his father quit smoking in 1957 when his older brother knows that that's what happened, when many of his other family members are aware of that fact.  I think that's a reasonable inference.

If the Martin inference can be used by the plaintiff the way it's being used in such a broad fashion, a similar inference is only fair in response from the defendants, otherwise the rules of this whole proceeding are frankly turned on their heads.

THE COURT:  I'm going to enforce the order that

was entered previously, and this -- and prohibit an indirect way of doing something that could not be done directly.  The same questions that you were permitted to ask the relatives that were on the stand and what they said on the stand, you covered quite a bit that way and, you know, what he actually knew.  And what he did know.

Certainly, if you -- if you want to use those responses that you know have been given here, which probably were also in the context of the deposition testimony he read, then you can -- you can ask those questions.

But what you're doing now is you're -- you're really -- it's -- it seems to be -- I'm not going to say a willful violation, but it seems to be in violation of the Court's order and it is not an appropriate cross.

So that's my ruling.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I understand Your Honor's ruling.

MR. SCHULTZ:  If I can be heard for 15 seconds. Mr. Geraghty knows full well -- we just had this argument two days ago.  He knows there's no foundation to connect what Ray Danielson knew to what Lamar Danielson knew about the reasons his

father quit, or the reasons his parents may or may not have permitted smoking.  We have this exact example in our argument to you.

I explained the Martin inference and the difference and I established the predicate for that with Dr. Cummings without objection during this trial.  And also the same inference that he availed information, that's a completely separate issue.

If he's going to continue to ask questions we can't unring the bell by sustaining objections over and over.  If he's going to ask questions that he knows full well have no foundation or connection to Mr. Danielson, I'm going to ask him to proffer that outside the jury's presence.  That's what I was asking for the other day.

THE COURT:  Well, I've made my ruling.  I've made my ruling.  At this point I have every reason to believe that Mr. Geraghty will follow the ruling.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.

(The following proceedings were held within the hearing of the jury.) BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, isn't it true that every cigarette that Lamar Danielson ever smoked came from a pack that had a government-mandated warning label on it?

A.
	That would be my assumption, yes.

Q.
	And those warnings told him in 1966 that

cigare
	tte smoking may be hazardous to his health, and in

1970 that the Surgeon General has determined that
	
cigare
	tte smoking is dangerous to your health, right?

A.
	True.

Q.
	Now, we're going to talk about this in more

detail
	, but Lamar Danielson was an intelligent man,

right?
	

A.
	Yes, by all accounts.

Q.
	Right.  You -- you said in your deposition

there
	was no dispute about that, right?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	He was described as well-educated?

A.
	Yes.

Q.   Now --

A.   Among other things.

Q.   -- isn't it true that an important factor in whether a young person smokes is whether his friends and family smoke?

A.   That is -- that certainly can be a predictor.

Q.   And you know, from reviewing the deposition testimony that you've read in this case, that his older brother Ray Danielson smoked cigarettes, right?

A.   Yes, he did.

Q.   And that many of Lamar Danielson's friends smoked cigarettes, too, correct?

A.   Yeah, I think his friend Jerry Pate talked about smoking with him when he was in high school, and that everybody was doing it, it was the cool thing to do, and Marlboro was the cigarette that kids were smoking at that time.

Q.   Now, you told the jury, I think, that you believe Lamar Danielson may have started smoking around the age of 14 or 15 in 1968 or '69?

A.   That's true.

Q.   Okay.  In fact, we know that Mr. Danielson filled out insurance forms -- life insurance application forms where he specifically -- bless you -- identified when he started smoking cigarettes, right?  You've seen

those forms, have you not?

A.   I have.

Q.   Okay.  And...

A.   Actually there are several of them.  They give different dates.

Q.   Right.  And we're going to go through those in a second here.  He was applying for life insurance for his family, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And the information that he filled out and recorded in these life insurance applications, he --Lamar Danielson filled them out before this lawsuit was ever filed; is that correct?

A.   True.  I think there's a record from '83, another one from '84, another one from '86, and another one from 1990.

Q.   Let's take a look at those.  The first one is PMU32559.  Do you see that?

A.   I do.

Q.   Okay.  It's got Mr. Danielson's name at the very top, Norman L. Danielson, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   His first name was Norman but he went by Lamar?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And it says the life insurance or annuity

A.   That's right.

Q.   And if we look, that's Mr. Danielson's signature there at the bottom, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   It says March 15, 1983?

A.   That's right.

Q.   In this box it says have you smoked cigarettes within the past year -- within the past ten years.  He checks yes, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And then it says how many cigarettes do you smoke per day?  He writes 20, which is one pack per day, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And for how many years have you smoked cigarettes, it says 12, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  And if we were to walk back from this date of March 15th, 1983, that would take us back to 1971, right?

Here's another one from 1984.  This is PMU32 --032559.

Do you see that one? A.   I do.

Q.   Okay.  And then if we look to the back page, it's got his name at the top, right? A.   That's right.

Q.   Same box there in the top corner, the question asks him, have you smoked cigarettes in the past ten years?  Yes.

How many cigarettes do you smoke per day?  It says 20 again, right? A.   That's right.

Q.   How many years have you smoked?  It says 13. And let's go down to the bottom. It's signed -- I'm going to blow this up so we can read this a little bit better -- signed by Mr. Danielson on September 6th, 1984, right? A.   That's right.

Q.   And it says:  "I declare that my answers and the statements on both sides of this page are correctly recorded, complete and true to the best of my knowledge and belief.  Statements in this application are representations and not warranties."

And there's the date, 9/6/84.  So this was done

in 1984
	Again, he told us in this form that he was

smoking
	about a pack of cigarettes a day, right?

A.
	Correct.

Q.
	And he had been smoking for 13 years, which

would,
	again, take us back to about 1971; is that right?

A.
	That's true.

Q.
	Now, he was, I think, perhaps interviewed by a

nurse or had a medical exam with a nurse around the same
	
period
	of time.


	This is part of that same document.  You've

A.

okay.

A.
	Yeah.

Q.
	It's got his signature here?

A.
	Yeah.

Q.

Yes.

	That would be a pack to a pack and a half,

correct?
	

A.
	That's right.

Q.
	And then below that it says how many years have

you smoked.
	

	And I believe that says 15 years, right?

A.
	It does say 15 years.

Q.
	So If we took that back that would take us back

to about
	1969?

A.
	That's right.

A.

Q.

A.
	Because this is in September; his birthday is

He says, "Yes.  One and one half packs per day," right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And this one was filled out --

A.   November.

Q.   November 20th, 1990.  That's his signature, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.  So those are the statements that Mr. Danielson, himself, made in these life insurance applications, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you don't have any reason to think that Mr. Danielson wasn't being completely honest and truthful when he filled out those life insurance applications, do you?

A.   No, I think it's accurate that he was a current smoker.  He may be underestimating his smoking.  As we saw one record, it indicated 20 cigarettes and on the same date, another one, 20 to 30.  So that's not uncommon, as I mentioned yesterday.

Q.   Well, why would he -- if he wanted -- he was applying for life insurance, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  Why would he underreport his cigarette smoking?  If he wanted to be nontruthful he would have

just said, "I don't smoke cigarettes/' right?

A.   I think he was fairly accurate, because the other reports from family members and people who knew him said he was smoking a pack and a half a day about that time, and increasing.

Q.   The records we just saw are consistent.  He writes 20 cigarettes a day, 20 cigarettes a day, 20 to 30 cigarettes a day, a pack and a half of cigarettes a day, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And these are statements he makes from 1983 right on up to 1990 over a seven-year period, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   Now, at whatever age he may have started smoking, we know that he could not have smoked cigarettes on a regular basis in high school because he was living at home with his parents, right?

A.   We don't know that he was not smoking on a regular basis.  I think as I recall, there was testimony from his father who recalled smelling smoke on him, and when he was in high school, his high school friend Jerry Pate talked about them smoking together.

Q.   Sir, isn't it true -- I'm sorry, are you finished?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Isn't it true that his parents did not allow him to smoke cigarettes?

A.   I think his parents talked to him about smoking cigarettes is my recollection from the testimony.

Q.   My question is, isn't it true that his parents did not allow him to smoke cigarettes?

A.   I don't... I'm not sure.

Q.   You don't know?

A.   I don't think that people were allowed to smoke in their house.

Q.   Well, didn't Micah Danielson say that he actually got caught smoking at least once when he was living at home, and he got punished, right?

A.   I recall that.

Q.   Okay.  That's what -- and you know that his mother was very strongly opposed to smoking cigarettes?

A.   I recall that as well.

Q.   To the point that years later when he was an adult, she would still tell him he shouldn't smoke cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I object to the form "would still

tell him" when we haven't had the predicate laid for

that.

A.   Yeah. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Right.  Well, we also know that, for example, his father said he didn't have money to buy cigarettes, right?

A.   At what age?  As a high school student?

Q.   When he was living at home under his parents' roof as a high school student.

A.   Yes, he did say that.

Q.   And we also know that his sister, Beverly, said -- he had an older sister, Beverly.  She's two years older than him.  She lived in the same home with him the entire time that he was a high school student, right?

A.   That's right.

Q. And she testified I never saw my brother smoke cigarettes while he was living at home as a high school student, right?

A.   She did say that.

Q.   She said the first time I saw my brother smoke cigarettes was when he came back to Pensacola from Miami after graduating from mortuary school in 1973, right?

A.   Yes, she did stay that.

Q. And we also had a coworker at the Faith Chapel Funeral Home, and his name is Billy Smith.

A.   Uh-huh.

Q.   He also was a funeral home director and an embaimer, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   About the same age as Lamar Danielson, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And he said he never saw Lamar Danielson smoke cigarettes until after he came back to Pensacola in 1973 after graduating from mortuary school, right?

A.   That is what he said.

Q.   Now, what you've been referring to is the fact that there is a friend of his named Jerry Pate, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And Jerry Pate recalls that sometime when they were in high school, he and Lamar Danielson and some other friends would hang out at Faith Chapel Funeral Home, right?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   They'd hang out on Friday nights when he had to answer these death calls, correct?

A.   Among other things, yeah.  I mean, they were close friends and they would hang out together and they would smoke together.

Q.   Right.  And he said when they would hang out at the funeral home on Friday nights while he was answering

A.   Uh-huh.

Q.   -- they would smoke cigarettes, drink beer, eat burgers, watch television?

A.   That's right.  Marlboro cigarettes, specifically.

Q.   Right.  No dispute he smoked Marlboro cigarettes, right?

A.   There is none.

Q.   We were talking earlier about the fact that Lamar Danielson was described by everyone as being very intelligent, correct?

A.   True.  I think --

Q.   Kept up with current events?

A.   Yes.

Q.   By all accounts, he read the newspaper on a daily basis at work, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was something he had to do as part of his job from what people described?

Q.   To train to become a funeral home director and an embalmer, right?

A.   True.

Q.   And he took science classes as part of that, right?  Did you know that?

A.   I would assume he would have to, yes.

Q.   Have you seen -- you were provided a copy of the certificate that he received, right, when he was certified as an embalmer and a funeral home director?

A.   I don't recall that one.

And it says, "Who has completed the prescribed course of instruction at the Miami-Dade Junior College, an accredited institution, and has this day been examined in the subjects of embalming, anatomy, pathology, bacteriology, chemistry, restorative art, and mortuary administration, and found to be proficient therein."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did, yes.

Q.   And he gets the certificate -- it's dated in 1974.

Do you see that down there?

A.   Yes.

Q.   But you know that he graduated from the mortuary college a year earlier in 1973?

A.   Correct.  The certificate is dated February '74, so early '74.

Q.   Yeah, this is less than a year after he graduates from the mortuary college?

A.   Correct.

seen the difference between the black and darkened lungs of smokers compared to the healthy-looking lungs of nonsmokers, right?

A.   That's not my understanding.  People who were in mortuary science that many decades ago, I think it was common to do autopsies; but that's not a practice I believe in the '70s, '80s, '90s and going forward.

Q.   Well, sir, isn't it true that you've actually observed autopsies during the years that you spent at Roswell Park Cancer Center, right?

A.   I did in the 1990s.

Q.   And so you've personally observed the difference between the healthy, pink lungs of nonsmokers versus the dark and blackened lungs of smokers, right?

A.   Yes, I have.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would like to display this for demonstrative purposes, if I could.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I don't have any objection, Your Honor.  The question was whether Dr. Cummings had seen them.  He can testify to it.

THE COURT:  The demonstrative purpose is just simply to demonstrate or confirm that he, Dr. Cummings, had seen these lungs while he was in Roswell in the 1990s.

MR. GERAGHTY:  That's where I'm starting, but I'm going to demonstrate the foundation that Mr. Lamar Danielson saw the same thing during his years working --

THE COURT:  Well, for the purposes you just told me, you want to use it as a demonstrative aid.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Right.

A.   That's right.

Q.   And on the right we have the black and darkened lungs of a heavy cigarette smoker?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And I think you've actually described the --the effects of cigarette smoking on lungs as the lungs actually look charred.

You've said that, have you not?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Now, isn't it true that his father, Norman Danielson, said that Lamar Danielson would have seen the difference between the pink lungs of a nonsmoker (indicating) and the dark and blackened lungs of a heavy cigarette smoker in his job as an embalmer and a funeral home director?

A.   Norman would have because Norman had been doing autopsies, but I believe -- I don't believe Lamar was involved in doing autopsies so he wouldn't see that, the lungs necessarily.

"ANSWER:  Oh, yeah.  I mean, that's � that's one thing that would really throw you for a loop because first all -- first of all, they used to do the autopsies at the funeral homes, and the lungs we'd look at.  A lot of the times the fingers would be just coated." Did I read that correctly? A.   You did.

Q.   Right.  And then let's take a look at the same deposition, Page 55.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Line 2.

"QUESTION:      You   said  that  you   --   you-all   have seen  darkened or blackened  lungs   from  former   smokers when   they   come   in.      Is   that   something  that  you   see  quite often?

"ANSWER:      I   don't   see   it  near   as  much  anymore as   I  used  to.      There  used  to  be  a  lot more  autopsies   at

the time, and you would see the results of either cancer or the blackened lungs and so forth." Correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Did I read that correctly so far?

A.   You did.

Q.   "When you would see this, do you realize right away that it's due to smoking cigarettes? "ANSWER:  No.

"QUESTION:  Do you recall anyone ever commenting after seeing a darkened or blackened lung that they thought it was the result of cigarette smoke?

"ANSWER:  Saying that guy was a bad smoker, I'm sure it's happened, yes.  You can definitely tell he was a smoker because -- you can look at their fingernails and fingers and all that too; but any instance, no.  I'm sure it happened."

Did I read that all correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   Okay.  Now, we also have testimony from Billy Smith, correct?  Billy Smith was one of the coworkers. He was also a funeral home director and embalmer in the 1970s and the 1980s at Faith Chapel Funeral Home at the very same time as Lamar Danielson, right?

A.   True.

Q.   Okay.  And he also said that Lamar Danielson would have seen the difference between a smoker and nonsmoker's lung, right?

A.   What page are you on?

Q.   Well, why don't you start -- Page 49.

A.   Okay.

Q.   49, Line 4.

A.   All right.

Q.   All right.  Let me find it here myself.  49, Line 4.

"Do you have any reason to think that during those years or at any time -- or at any other time when Lamar was embalming a body that had undergone an autopsy, that he wouldn't have had a chance to see a smoker's lungs?

"ANSWER:  He would have had a chance to see a

smoker and a nonsmoker's lungs." Right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what Mr. Smith talked about was that what would happen was the autopsies would be done down at the medical examiner's office, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And after the autopsy, they would send the body to the funeral home to be embalmed?

A.   If an autopsy was done.

Q.   Did Mr. Smith say that on average they had about 125 bodies that were embalmed at the funeral home that had been through autopsies?  Do you recall him saying that?

A.   Per year during that -- yes.

Q.   During this period of time we're talking about, the '70s and '80s?

A.   Actually, I don't think he's talking about the '80s.  He's talking about '74, I think, to '77, so...

Q.   Well, he's talking about the early 1970s?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Right.  And what he said was originally they would send -- they'd have to open up a cavity, right, to do the autopsy, the chest cavity?

A.   I'm not sure if they were doing autopsies. Those were done by the medical examiner.

Q.   That's what I'm talking about.

You said you observed autopsies?

A.   That's right.

Q.   The medical examiner opens up the chest cavity?

A.   Yes, they do.

Q.   And they remove the lungs?

A.   They remove the organs, that's true.

Q.   If we're removing the lungs of a nonsmoker,

we've got the pink lungs here on the left; and if we're removing the lungs of a heavy smoker, we've got the dark lungs on the right?

A.   True.

Q.   And what Billy Smith described was there was a period of time when the medical examiner would put all the organs inside the chest cavity, and then they'd ship that autopsied body to the funeral home, and the embaimer would have to embalm that body.  But he would have to reach in and handle the organs of that autopsied body, right?

A.   He did say that.

Q.   And later on, he said they changed that procedure, and what they did was the medical examiner would take the organs out of the chest cavity and then put them in biohazard bags, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   So then the body would get shipped to the funeral home with none of the organs inside the chest --

A.   That's right.

Q.   -- but all of them in these biohazard bags --

A.   That's right.

Q. -- and the embaimer would physically have to take each organ out of the biohazard bag and place it into the chest cavity.  And they would embalm the body.

And, of course, they would put a suit or clothing on it so they could have a funeral?

A.   True.

Q.   And Mr. Danielson said, based upon the testimony that you've heard from Billy Smith, he must have done that dozens of times throughout the 1970s?

A.   It's not clear how many times Lamar did it. But certainly Mr. Smith is doing it, yes.

Q.   Let's move forward then.

MR. GERAGHTY:  We can take that down now. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Just a couple of questions about Mr. Danielson's smoking history.

You determined that Mr. Danielson was addicted using the Heaviness of Smoking Index test --

A.   That's right.

Q.   -- right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Two questions.

A.   Well, persistent daily user, and then you apply the Heaviness of Smoking test to it.  And I did that, yes.

Q.   Right.  And one of those questions is, "How many cigarettes did Mr. Danielson smoke per day?"

A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  And I just want to be clear.  We've shown all of those life insurance application forms, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Mr. Danielson never said in any of those life insurance applications that he smoked two to three packs per day, did he?

A.   Not on the life insurance forms.

Q.   Well, I mean, he never said it anywhere, did he?

A.   Well, the observations from people who saw him, such as his coworker, Ms. Joyner and his wife, said he was smoking two to three packs.

Q.   Listen to my question, though.  I think you may have misunderstood my question.

My question is:  Did Lamar Danielson ever write down anywhere that he smoked two to three packs of cigarettes per day?

A.   No.  I don't believe he did write down anywhere.  I wouldn't expect somebody to write it down.

Q.   Right.  Well, we have four forms where he wrote down the amount of cigarettes he smoked.  And in each one of those forms, he said either 20 cigarettes a day -- 20 cigarettes a day, a pack to a pack and a half, or a pack and a half?

A.   Sure.  And I believe in the forms that he wrote down that he sent to Philip Morris he was talking about buying by the carton.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would move to strike that last

answer as nonresponsive, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I would grant the request. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   You know we have a medical record at the time that Lamar Danielson was ultimately diagnosed with lung cancer where he was asked by that doctor, "How much are you smoking?"  And he gave that doctor -- he told the doctor he smoked a pack and a half a day; right?

A.   That's right.  That was right at the time I think he was trying to cut back.

Q.   So this is PMU -- this is DAM0016.  Let's just start at the top here.

A.   Sure.

Q.   You've got Lamar Danielson's name here, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   The doctor is Thomas Williams?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And is this the record where Lamar Danielson goes to see Dr. Williams, and he's ultimately diagnosed with lung cancer?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And Dr. Williams takes a very thorough history, right?

A.   True.

Q.   He actually makes a point in here that it's --see this line, "However, on careful questioning"?  Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q. So Dr. Williams actually took time to ask him about his medical history, his current health, and his cigarette smoking, right?

A. Well, the standard medical practice, based on my experience.

Q.   Right.  And so Mr. Danielson tells him -- and this is what Dr. Thomas writes.  I've highlighted it. It says, "He has been a smoker smoking one pack to a pack and one and a half of cigarettes a day, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   So that's what he tells the doctor in 1994?

A.   It also talks about the fact that he had stopped smoking for a period and relapsed.

Q.   I'll show that.  We haven't -- I was going to come back to that, but I'll show it real quick.  The very next line which I didn't highlight, but I have another copy where we've got it highlighted, it says, "He stopped for a period of about four months but had

started again and has smoked for some period of time/' right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   My point simply being that we have now five instances in which Lamar Danielson, before this lawsuit was ever filed, was asked, "How much do you smoke?"  And he never said, "I smoke two to three packs of cigarettes per day/' right?

A.   That's true.

Q.   Now, let's -- we're going to talk about the second part of that test that you talked about, but let's talk about this -- Lamar Danielson was surrounded by people in his life who were themselves well-educated, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   I mean, Mrs. Danielson herself was trained as a nurse, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   She received her LPN at the age of 19, in 1972, correct?

A.   That's my understanding.

Q.   And her father had been diagnosed with emphysema before she had ever trained to become a nurse?

A.   I have to say I don't recall that.

Q.   You don't recall that?

A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  All right.  Well, do you recall that her father was a cigarette smoker?

A.   Yes.

Q.   All right.  You just don't recall that he was diagnosed with emphysema?

A.   No.

Q.   That was something you missed in your review of the materials?

A.   Apparently.

Q.   Okay.  Now, you also said that under that second test on the Heaviness of Smoking Index that Mr. Danielson would light up a cigarette before getting out of bed, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you base that upon the testimony of what Ms. Micah Danielson said, correct?

A.   Yes, in part.  "The time to first cigarette," she said, "Light up first thing in the morning before getting out of bed."  I had recorded that in my notes.

Q.   Isn't it true, though, that Mrs. Danielson testified -- and this is a direct quote, "He," meaning her husband, "was usually out of the house by the time I got up."  Didn't she say that?

there's

statements on when he would smoke his first cigarette of
	
the day,

Q.   He was a very hard worker?

A.   Yes, he was, by all accounts.

Q.   All right.  Let's move on -- Mr. Danielson enjoyed smoking cigarettes, correct?

A. There were some people that said he enjoyed it. There were some people who said they didn't know whether he enjoyed it or not. I think everybody said he enjoyed it; said he was addicted.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Move to strike that as

nonresponsive, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'll deny the request. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q. Mr. Danielson enjoyed the social aspects of smoking, according to his good friend, Ricky Stokes; isn't that right?

A.   Yes, he did.

Q.   Right.  He enjoyed to blow smoke rings, according to Charles Dillard the operations manager at Faith Chapel Funeral Home, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   He was a loyal Marlboro Reds smoker?

A.   Yes.

Q.   He liked the taste of Marlboro cigarettes?

A.   Some people did say -- they commented he liked the taste of Marlboros.

Q.   That was his brand, right?

A.   No denying that was his brand.

Q.   And he apparently never switched and never bummed other brands of cigarettes from people; isn't that right?

A.   That's my assessment.

Q.   What's that?

A.   That is my assessment.

Q.   Okay.  He liked to drink coffee, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And he enjoyed drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes together; isn't that correct?

A.   I think they did go together.

Q.   His wife, Micah Danielson, said he would smoke more when he was drinking coffee in the morning?

A.   She may have said that.  I don't recall that.

Q.   You don't recall that?

A.   Yeah.

Q. Well, do you recall her saying that smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee was a ritual with her husband?

A.   I remember the pairing of coffee and a cigarette.  That's --

Q.   Let me ask you to take a look at Page 188 of her deposition.

A.   Sure.  Okay.

Q.   See Page 188, Line 10?

A.   I do.

Q.   She says, "Right, right, but I know when he drank his coffee, it was a ritual, or if he was drinking beer," right?

A.   Right.

Q.   And Mrs. Danielson actually said that Mr. Danielson's favorite cigarette of the day was the cigarette that he would have with his cup of coffee. That's in a different passage.

A.   Yeah, it's a different passage.  I don't dispute that.

Q.   Okay.  And we just talked about this a moment ago, but Mr. Danielson worked very long hours at the funeral home, right?

A.   60 to 80 hours a week, yeah.

Q.   Right.  And he had a very stressful job, did he not?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Many people who were asked, testified that working at a funeral home is a very stressful job, correct?

A.   Sure.  I can imagine.  You're dealing with families and so on.

Q.   Right.  He's dealing with families who have just recently lost a loved one. A.   That's right.

Q.   And he's got to be empathetic to those people, and he's got to deal with they have to make decisions about the funeral arrangements and things like that? A.   Sure.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Mr. Geraghty, I'm sorry to interrupt.  Judge, if we could approach for one moment.

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Not related to the examination.

THE COURT:  Yes.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MR. SCHULTZ:  We've got two witnesses outside, and even if Mr. Geraghty finished in the next ten minutes, redirect will probably be about 10 to 15 minutes.  So unless -- you'll be done real quick, which I'm not asking.  I just want to release them so they're not waiting any longer than they need to be.

MR. GERAGHTY:  It's taken longer than I anticipated, Your Honor, obviously.  I don't think I'm going to finish by 5:00, and I think I'm still

going to have a good 45 minutes or so at least.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, my intention is to finish this witness today and so we'll just press on.  Might have the jury come in a bit late in the morning.  We can take care of business.  We can do whatever argument we've got to do.  But rather than break up your cross of this witness, it seems to make most sense to just let it -- to let you go.  Do what you've got to do.  Okay?  And then, again, you tell me that you anticipate 15 to 20 minutes on your --

MR. SCHULTZ:  So far.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I appreciate that.  The only thing I might ask, then, is when I finish this little section on Mr. Danielson if you gave me two or three minutes to give them a stretch break for me to regroup, maybe I can shorten that up.

THE COURT:  In no view of what you're doing would we be able to get everybody in -- to get your -- finished and his rebuttal in before 5.

So in direct answer to his question -- thank you for bringing that to my attention.  I'll authorize you to release those witnesses and also to bring them back here in the morning.  Make sure you have a number to call so you can tell them when to

be back in the morning.

MR. SCHULTZ:  They're family members, and we'll probably end up putting Dr. Burns up and then have them come after him.  We had them here because we thought we were going to be early today with Dr. Cummings.

THE COURT:  Right.  Okay.  Thanks.  So it's not a critical thing.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Correct.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. SCHULTZ:  The only other issue is -- and I don't want to have to bring it up on a separate break, we are going to ask for a life insurance instruction.  It's been brought up several times, including he went and bought life insurance for his family and I think it's been made enough of a feature of the cross it would be appropriate to instruct the jury.

THE COURT:  In the final instruction?

MR. SCHULTZ:  After the --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.

it' s a

A.
	Yes.
	
	

Q.
	Billy Smith said working in a funeral
		home is

very s
	tressful?
	
	

A.

Q.

with the stress
		of his job on a daily basis, ri

A.
	Yes.
	
	

Q.
	And Mr
	. Danielson smoked cigarettes to
	help

deal with the stress associated with his job, correct?
			
A.
	No, he
	persisted in smoking cigarettes
	because

he was
	addicted
	to nicotine.
	

Q.
	All right.  Doctor, isn't it true that
		people

said they would
		call him a three-family smoker.
	He

would
	nave a cigarette before the family would
		come in

because he was nervous about meeting with the family,
			
right?
	
	
	

A.
	He'd have a cigarette before he would
		meet with

the family.  He

obviously.  And

	t?

Q.   Right.  He drank Busch beer.  That was his brand?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And he liked the taste of Busch beer.  Several witnesses said that, did they not?

A.   They said he liked beer.

Q.   Well, didn't his wife say that he liked the taste of beer?

A.   Yes.

Q.   I mean, Micah Danielson said that, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   He drank about a six-back pack of Busch beer every night.  That's what friends and family members said?

A.   I think there might be a reference to the fact that he drank a beer every night.

Q.   I'm sorry?

A.   A beer every night.

Q.   One beer every night?

A.   He'd have a beer when he came home.

Q.   That's your recollection of the testimony of the witnesses?

A.   There were lots of witnesses asked about his drinking.  I don't think anybody suggested he had a drinking problem.

A.   Right.

Q. But I'm asking you -- so Ray Danielson his older brother, how much did he say that his younger brother Lamar Danielson smoked on a daily basis?

A.   Smoked?

Q.   Excuse me.  Drank.

A.   Let me see on the smoking.

Q.   Dr. Cummings, I misspoke.  Let me try again. What did Ray Danielson his older brother say about the amount of beers that Lamar Danielson drank on a daily basis?

A.   I don't know.

Q.   You don't recall?

A.   No.  I'd --

Q.   What did his --

A.   I have the smoking part but I don't have the beer part.

Q.   Well, I mean, you've -- you've done research where you've talked about alcohol and the influence alcohol has on whether people will be successful quitting smoking, haven't you?

what people said about the amount that Mr. Danielson smoked -- or excuse me, drank on average on a daily basis?

A.   I recall that he drank beer.  And I looked at all of the evidence and there was no evidence he had a drinking problem, which is where you see the problems interfering with someone's ability to quit smoking, and so I didn't focus on the drinking after I reviewed it.

I mean, I did go through it and I noted that he drank beer, but I also looked to see if there was any evidence that he had a drinking problem.  And he did not, based on all accounts that -- of my assessment.

A.   Correct.

Q.   Now, you say that Mr. Danielson was addicted to cigarettes?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Because he smoked cigarettes on a persistent daily basis, right?

A.   That's right.

Q. Well, based on the evidence we have in this case, Mr. Danielson drank beer on a persistent daily basis.

A.   Yes.

Q.   Was he addicted to the alcohol in beer?

A.   I didn't see that it had any effect on his work or performance, but he could have been.  He might have been mildly addicted.

Q.   All right.  But what you said a moment ago was you didn't see it had any effect on his work or any of those sorts of things; isn't that right?

A.   There is no evidence of that in any of the material I reviewed.

Q.   Okay.

A.   There's no mention of it as a problem in the medical records I reviewed.

Q.   Right.  He enjoyed drinking beer and smoking cigarettes in the evening after work.  Isn't that true?

A.   He smoked a lot of cigarettes and he often had a beer after work, yes.

Q.   Well, did Mrs. Danielson say that he enjoyed -- appeared to like to smoke cigarettes when he was drinking beer in the evening?

A.   She did.

Q.   And he drank beer for the same reasons he smoked cigarettes in many instances.  They helped him unwind and relax after a long day, right?

A.   He smoked cigarettes because he was addicted to nicotine.  He tried to quit; he couldn't.

Q. Isn't it true that witnesses testified that Mr. Danielson liked to drink beer, that it helps him unwind and relax after long day?

A.   Some witnesses were asked about his drinking of beer.  Some witnesses were asked about his enjoyment of smoking and stress reduction.

And of -- of the 15 people who were asked about whether he was -- actually ten people who were asked about his addiction to nicotine --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would move to

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm going to let you re-ask

directly to your question.

BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   My question simply is didn't people say that he enjoyed drinking beer because it helped him unwind and relax after a long day at work?

A.   Some people did say that.

Q.   Right.  And they described him enjoying hanging out in his back yard smoking cigarettes, drinking beer, cooking on his grill?

A.   Yes.

Q.   People described that that's what he did most every evening after he came home from work?

A.   I'm not sure if it was most every evening, but they did describe the fact that he liked to grill out.

Q.   Now, let's move forward.

In 197 9 his older brother Ray Danielson quit smoking, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   His mother-in-law Lorraine Sanders quit smoking, right?

A.   In what year?

Q.   1979, 1980, thereabouts.

A.   I think she was a little unclear as to when she quit.  But yes, I think there is testimony to that effect.

Q.   His sister-in-law Becky Wiggins, she quit

smoking in 1979 when she became pregnant with her first child, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And so Becky Wiggins is Micah Danielson's older sister?

A.   That's right.

Q.   She's also a nurse?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And Becky Wiggins and her mother Lorraine Sanders begin to encourage Lamar and Micah Danielson to quit smoking around the time that Becky quits in 1979?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And she would encourage Lamar Danielson to quit smoking, correct?

A.   True.  The actual dates, I think there might be some confusion there, because there's conflicting testimony as to the dates.  But, yes, they were encouraging Lamar to stop smoking.

Q.   And Becky Wiggins said that when she would encourage Lamar Danielson to quit smoking he would say things to her like, "Sis, get out of here, you're being holier than thou, you know, give me a break," and she testified that he was annoyed with her?

A.   I don't know what specific response is, but, you know, I do recall some testimony he sort of pushed

it off at some times, and at other times he was trying to quit.

Q.   Okay.  Well, didn't she say -- Becky Wiggins say that he had a mind of his own?

A.   Sure, he did, she did say that.

Q.   And Lamar Danielson's mother-in-law Lorraine Sanders also encouraged him to quit, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And Becky Wiggins said that Lamar Danielson responded in many of the same ways to his mother-in-law that he responded to her, but, of course, he was more respectful because this was his mother-in-law.  Isn't that what she said?

A.   She did.

Q. Now, we talked about this earlier. His mother, Myrtle Danielson, continued to encourage her son to quit smoking when he was an adult, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And Lawana Joyner said that Myrtle Danielson was a force to be reckoned with, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And when she would come to the funeral home they would hide all the ash trays and they would spray cleaner, disinfectant, so that she wouldn't be able to tell that they were smoking cigarettes?

A. Yeah, because Ms. Joyner was -- in the 1980s was Lamar's smoking buddy. They both smoked together and -- yes.

Q.   And when Myrtle Danielson, his mother, would tell you, Lamar Danielson, you should quit smoking, you shouldn't smoke, Lawana Joyner said that Lamar Danielson would stand his ground and he would say "This is what I do"?

A.   She did say that.

Q.   Now, let's keep moving forward.  1985, warning labels on cigarette packs change again, right?

A.   They do.

Q.   This is just for demonstrative purposes. There's now a series of four rotating warnings that go on all packs of cigarettes, right?

A.   True.

Q.   One of those, the third one down, smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and may complicate pregnancy, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   We know that Lamar Danielson was at least aware of these warnings, because one of his coworkers recalls Mr. Danielson walking around in 1985 and reading one of the warning labels on his pack of cigarettes and commenting that the warning on his pack was different

from the warning on another person's pack?

A.   Yes, that's true.

Q.   Now, you talked about the fact that -- I think you referred to Lawana Joyner as his smoking buddy, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   In 1985, same sort of period of time that the warning labels go on cigarette packs, Lawana Joyner tells Lamar Danielson "I have three family members who have throat cancer.  I'm concerned about my health," right?

A.   She did say that.

Q.   And she also said that he did not try to quit smoking at that point in time when she tried to quit?

A.   Not when she tried to quit, but she did recall, you know, very specific quit attempts sort of in this period around '86, '87 when his daughter Sandi was born.

Q.   And let's get right to that, then.  Let's move right to that point.

A.   Sure.

Q.   Isn't it true that the first time that Lamar Danielson ever tried to quit smoking, based upon the testimony of his wife Micah Danielson, was in approximately 1987 about a year or so after his first --their second daughter -- excuse me -- Sandi is born,

right?

A.   She recalled that instance, yes.

Q.   Okay.

A.   Not sure if it's the first instance or not.

Q.   All right.

A.   Because there's other testimony about earlier quits.

Q.   Mrs. Danielson recalls that her husband tried to quit smoking on three occasions, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   The first time was in 1987 about a year after their daughter Sandi is born, right?

A.   True.

Q.   The second time, although she's vague on the exact time period and the details, she believes it was by using the patch and she thinks it was in the 1990s, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you know based upon when the patch was first launched and how it was available that the earliest that could have been was late 1992 or 1993?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  And then the third time she recalls Lamar Danielson quitting was when he quit in November 1994 when he's told that he has lung cancer?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  Now, isn't it true that Micah Danielson never encouraged her husband to quit smoking?

A.   That's true.

Q.   Right.  She said that she never tried to get her husband to stop smoking?

A.   That's right.

Q.   When he stopped in 1987 -- and it's a little bit -- people have different memories, but we know from the medical record that he told the doctor that he stopped for four months, Mrs. Danielson didn't stop at the same time her husband did in 1987, right?

A.   Yeah.  The record was '96, just to be clear, November of '96.  It talked about having quit for four months prior to that time.  He had stopped for four months at some future time and then relapsed back to smoking.

Q.   Actually, just so we're clear, the record is from November of 1994.

A.   True, yes.

Q.   Okay.  And it refers to him quitting at some point in time for four months, right?

A.   Right.  I thought you said '97.  That's why I was questioning the record.

Q.   I can put that record back up if you want.

A.   No, I recall it.  You could save some time.

Q. Thank you. I'm sure everybody would appreciate that.

And, as a matter of fact, you discussed this in your deposition, but during that period of time several witnesses said that Lamar Danielson gained a fairly significant amount of weight, right?

A.   I think the weight gain was around earlier-on quits, yes, but he had gained some weight.  I believe that's talked about by his coworker.  Lawana talks about it and -- because she gained weight when she tried to quit as well.

Q.   His brother Ray Danielson recalls that Lamar Danielson went from maybe 170 or 175 pounds up to somewhere around 200 pounds?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.

A. There's definite evidence that he gained weight when he stopped. That's evidence of withdrawal. That's one of the withdrawal symptoms you look for.

Q.   When he was -- stopped smoking during this period of time, he was exercising and running and riding a bike?

A.   That's right.  That was in the late '80s.

Q.   And Mrs. Danielson said she would go with him

and walk, but she would smoke cigarettes while she walked?

A.   She did say that.

Q.   All right.  Let me just -- make sure I've got this here.

His son Billy Danielson believes -- he doesn't recall the exact date, but he believes his father quit smoking in the late '80s and he says he quit for several months, perhaps as long as one year, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And that's consistent with the medical record we have of him quitting for four months or thereabouts?

A.   Well, I'm not sure that those are consistent. The late '80s was a period of time -- I believe around the patch was about a week, so -- and then there's another quit attempt it appears and there's some reference in a medical -- in a medical record about using patches with an expiration date on it.

Q.   Now, isn't it true that Mrs. Danielson didn't have a discussion with her husband about why he resumed smoking in 1987?  Said she never really discussed it with him?

A.   I don't know.

Q.   You don't recall that?

A.   I don't recall the specifics of the discussion.

If it's in the record, it is what it is.  Rather than me just making up something.

Q.   That's fine.  That's fine.

His older brother Ray Danielson recalls having a conversation with his younger brother where Lamar Danielson tells him, you know, I'm unhappy that I've gained some weight.  I think if I started smoking I'd probably lose this weight.

A.   That's true.  Nicotine affects your metabolism.

Q.   We also know that during this period of time when he stopped smoking in 1987 Mr. Danielson didn't stop drinking beer.

A.   True.

Q.   Okay.  Now, one of your opinions is that Mr. Danielson continued to smoke despite knowledge of the harmful effects of smoking, right?

A.   That's right.

Q. And one of the examples you pointed to was that Mr. Danielson continued to smoke after a doctor told him in 1990 that he should stop smoking, right?

A.   Well, that was one of the --

Q.   One example.

A.   One example, but actually the better example was he's talking about the warning labels around 1985, '86 period, because they -- were different warnings on

there.  So he's obviously at that point acknowledging or seeing the warnings on the packs.

Q.   But the example I'm asking about, though, is in 1990 -- this is several years after 1987 -- he's told by a doctor that he should stop smoking when he goes in to have a lesion removed from his nose, right?

A.   That's right.  I think there's testimony from others -- I don't recall whether it's his brother or --I'd have to go look at the testimony specifically where the doctor told him to quit.

Q.   Okay.  And then we know -- I'm going to try to shorten this up very significantly here.

If we fast-forward to November 1994.  I've showed you the medical record.  He's told he has lung cancer, and several witnesses all testified that Mr. Danielson quit smoking in 1994.  The jury has already heard from Lawana Joyner and Ricky Stokes.

You're familiar with their testimony, right?

A.   I am.

Q.   Okay.  Now, you talked about -- you've talked about cigarette manufacturers.  You talked about the Tobacco Institute.  You've talked about the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and the Council for Tobacco Research, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Isn't it true that to Micah Danielson's knowledge Lamar Danielson never heard a statement made by the Tobacco Institute or the Tobacco Industry Research Committee or the Council for Tobacco Research?

A.   It's true that she was asked those questions. She didn't know whether he had heard any of the statements.  Most people would know those statements. They are often put out by -- leading scientists challenged the evidence and not knowing the source of that -- those press releases.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would move to strike the last part of that answer as nonresponsive.

THE COURT:  I'll deny the request. MR. GERAGHTY:  I couldn't hear, Your Honor. THE COURT:  I denied the request to strike. Thank you. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   And isn't it true that she also said that she didn't recall ever having a conversation with her husband?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, we've got an order in limine on silence as an admission.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Approach the bench, please. (The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MR. SCHULTZ:  I didn't mean to interrupt the question Judge, but I heard the preface of isn't it true she never heard her husband say or something close to that, so whatever was coming out I assume was something he never said to her.

THE COURT:  Well, I don't know because I think it got cut off before the end of the question, but let me see.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, I thought I asked the same question that I asked about the TI and the TIRC and the CTR.  It was perfectly appropriate, so --

MR. SCHULTZ:  It wasn't perfectly appropriate. I didn't object to it.  And the question was to her knowledge he never heard anything from the statements.  And then the next question began something very close to he never said anything to her about something was the import of it, as I heard the question.

THE COURT:  The question was that she didn't ever recall having a conversation with him about it.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.

THE COURT:  Okay.  The testimony -- I mean, it certainly -- part of what this is about is -- is what sort of information he had and whether the family sat around and talked about it.  If she had a

conversation with him, that would be relevant.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.

THE COURT:  And if they do talk about it, you know, whether he can then argue from that inference of silence means something -- but I think that -- I don't think -- I don't think that question implicates that ruling.  I think that it's a fair question he can ask, did they ever sit around and have a conversation.  If the answer is no, it's no.

I mean, it's just like you talking about there's no evidence that the father talked to him about it; there's no evidence that the brother talked to him about it, that sort of stuff, and it falls in that line.

And the follow-up question may be a problem.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I understand the distinction, Judge.  The evidence on the father is that he didn't talk to him about it, which is different.

THE COURT:  Right.  But they didn't have a conversation.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Fair enough.  If he's going to say did you-all talk about cigarette advertising, the answer is no.  But if the next answer [sic] is so he never told you that he was influenced by anything a cigarette company said, that's where the

objection comes in.

THE COURT:  Well, specifically the question that was asked is, isn't it true that she also said that she didn't recall ever having a conversation with her husband.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And so that's � that's not an implication of -- by silence of anything as far as --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Unless the rest of the question is in which he told her X, Y, and Z.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I mean, did you ever have a conversation about the subject?  That's laying a foundation.  The answer --

THE COURT:  That was the question.  Okay?  So at this point on that question I -- I -- there's nothing -- I overrule the objection.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.

THE COURT:  But certainly there is an order that's in place regarding any inference of silence -- inference of admission by silence.

MR. SCHULTZ:  As long as it doesn't have an implication that that's where that question ends.  I won't object if that's the foundational question.  I

understand that, Judge.
		

THE
	COURT:  Okay.
	

MR.
	GERAGHTY:  I just want to
	make sure.  It's

getting late, obviously.  Are you

the question I was trying to ask?
		

THE
	COURT:  The question you
	asked was

perfectly a fine question.
		

MR.
	GERAGHTY:  That's what I
	thought.

THE
	COURT:  Okay.  So the que
	stion that you

asked is
	a perfectly fine question
	She doesn't

ever recall having a conversation.
		

MR.
	GERAGHTY:  Okay.
	

THE
	COURT:  The next part is
	his concern.

MR.
	GERAGHTY:  It's going to
	be one question

and then
	I'm moving on because of
	the lateness of

the hour
	I'm almost about to ask
	for that break.

That was

	I was going to ask

for the break.

that he heard or relied upon a statement about smoking and health made by Philip Morris or some other cigarette manufacturer?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Same objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Okay.  That's a different question than was asked previously.  And so that completely changes my ruling.

I do sustain the objection to the question that's asked.  Thank you.

MR. GERAGHTY:  All right. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   She doesn't recall -- let me try it one more time.

Mrs. Danielson doesn't recall having a conversation with her husband where he told her that he heard --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, that is the same question.  I object.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to tell you what I'm trying to do.  And it's actually going to implicate you.  What I'm trying to do is get to the end of this witness's testimony.

Now, I certainly have to be considerate of the parties' rights to ask the questions they need to

ask, both on cross-examination and on any redirect examination.

My anticipation is, if I keep going so that I can get this witness off the stand so that tomorrow when we start we can get another witness on the stand, it's going to take more of your time.

And so that's where I am.  And it's looking to me like if I stay and persist, that we're probably looking at going up to possibly the 6:00 hour.  I would not go past 6:00.  But it's like we might possibly go to the 6:00 hour.

One of the things I would need from you is I need to know if that creates a problem.  Because I know some people have children, childcare.  Some people have obligations and things like that, so it -- that would make a difference.

What I'm going to ask you to do is I'm going to take a short break here so that you can just take a piece of paper with you, and if you have any such problem, I just need you to write it down for me and tell me about it.  Just write down and tell me about it.  And if you have got a problem and we need to break now, we're going to do that.  If -- if you can stay with me until 6:00 and maybe we can get this witness off and get another witness on, then this

witness can get back to wherever he needs to get back to and -- and we can begin with another witness tomorrow.

While you're doing that, I'm going to have a conversation with the attorneys here.

Thank you.  Step into the jury room, please.

(The jury left the courtroom at 5:01 p.m.)

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Please have a seat.

Mr. Schultz, I -- do you have the wording of the ruling by the Court?  I've got it up here, but you may all have your hand on it already.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I do have it, Your Honor.  I'll hand it up, or do you want me to read it?

THE COURT:  Thank you.  This is a December 5, 2014, ruling by Judge Bell.  Is there any other ruling that -- is this encompassed by any ruling I made at our pretrial conference?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Not that I'm aware of, Judge.

THE COURT:  That's my question, because it all sort of blends together after a while.  So with regard to this one, "There was a motion in limine made by plaintiff to preclude use of silence as an admission.  And it's ordered and adjudged that the motion is granted.  There shall be no argument or evidence suggesting any inference from Lamar

Danielson's silence on a given matter unless defendant establishes the necessary predicate outside the jury's presence."

Well, I don't know what the necessary predicate would be outside the jury's presence on that, but there hasn't been a predicate established yet.

So, Mr. Geraghty, where are we on what you're trying to accomplish?  Maybe I'm missing what it is that you're trying to accomplish, and you can --

MR. GERAGHTY:  I mean, look, Your Honor, the jury can draw inferences from all these things.  I think one way to -- Mr. Schultz wants the jury to draw the inference that because all this information is out there, that it must have had an influence on Lamar Danielson.  I understand that's his argument.

But by the same token, how else are we supposed to rebut or defeat that inference or suggest that that's not the appropriate inference for the jury to draw if we can't elicit the fact that when he's with the people he's closest to in the world, he never articulates any of the evidence that would support drawing the inference the plaintiff wants them to draw?

And, look, at the -- it's not like you're granting a directed verdict in my favor if I get to

ask the question.  The jury just gets to hear it all, and then the jury gets to decide what weight the evidence Mr. Schultz put in through Dr. Cummings in direct should have and what weight my cross-examination should have.  And that's what this trial should be all about.

And I guess -- all I'm going to say is I'm not sure I even understand -- Your Honor said, "Well," with the predicate and all that, "I'm not sure I really understand what this motion is doing or not." And I guess -- I apologize.  I thought Your Honor had told me at sidebar that I could ask -- that was the question I had in my head that I got halfway out.

THE COURT:  Right.  I've read the question that you had asked at least twice, maybe three times while we were at the sidebar.  And I said, "That question is inoffensive.  That's fine.  You can ask that question."  And the question was:  Did -- was there a conversation?  Did Mrs. Danielson have a conversation with her husband about this?

And you certainly can ask that.  And, you know, did Mrs. Danielson admit that she communicated to her husband that -- that there are these health risks and there are all these problems and all that.

Did anybody else say that they had talked to him about it?  And you've had a chance to do that. You've gone through all the brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, and all that sort of stuff.

The question certainly that I -- if there was an admission by him somewhere that he had read something, then that certainly is fair game that he had read it, but -- "so he never mentioned to you anything about this?"  That's the silence.  That's the -- that's trying to draw an inference from a negative that's impermissible.  That's the extent of that ruling.  Okay?

And so that's where we are.  And it's the ruling.  It's in the case.  It's not going to be changed.  I'm not going to change it.  And if -- and the question, which was objected to and I sustained the objection, you simply re-ask it again.  And I understand you want to ask the question.  You want to get the answer in.  It's not going to happen.

So on that one, we're just going to need to move on.

to -- if the jury is ready, we need to hear from them, because if they can't wait to 6:00, then I can't.

MR. SCHULTZ:  One thing that might inform the analysis, Judge, is that Dr. Cummings has missed his flight.  So he's going to be here tonight either way.  So if we are here for a half an hour, 45 minutes or an hour in the morning, we're not inconveniencing him at this point.

THE COURT:  Here's the whole thing, respectfully to Dr. Cummings, it ain't about him. Okay?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Okay.

THE COURT:  And you started to say something, Mr. Geraghty.  What is it you want to say?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Here's what I'm going to say, and I -- I didn't hear the exact comment, but Dr. Cummings and I had an exchange in which I said I was trying to move things along, and someone said something -- I think Dr. Cummings may have heard it -- like, "Yeah, let's move it along."

Your Honor, it's 5:00.  I feel like the longer that I'm standing at this podium, I am the one who is going to be blamed for this, and I don't think that's fair to me.

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And I realize I didn't know that Dr. Cummings had missed his flight.  I was going to say my apologies to Dr. Cummings, if that were the case.

But we're going to put on one witness.  And I'm cross-examining the witness that they've called to talk about the most significant issues in the case, and Mr. Schultz had him on direct for probably nine hours total.  I'm between four -- I guess I'm at four now, not including the breaks, or including the breaks, rather, and I just -- I'm very concerned that the jury is going to be very aggravated if I go for another 45 minutes, and I don't think that's fair to me.  And now knowing what Dr. Cummings situation is, again, I apologize to him that it's taken this long.

But I've got a job to do, and it's very important, and I can't short-change, you know, what I need to do to protect my client's interests because of the schedule, particularly when we're well ahead of the schedule.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me roll back to what you told me at the sidebar at 5:25.  You told me at the side bar at 5:25 that you had, I thought, about

another 25 to 30 minutes to go.

MR. GERAGHTY:  No.  I thought it was going to be 45 --

THE COURT:  45 minutes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  � at that point.

THE COURT:  And now -- and then you said, "What I will do -- what I want to do is let me go ask a couple more questions right here, and then I want to ask you to give them a stretch break, and I'll go back, and I'll look at things, and I think I'm going to shorten it and all so we can get this done."

That's what I heard, and I was operating with that information that you gave me.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Right.

THE COURT:  Again, I repeat to the attorneys all the time, you know, don't build up an expectation that is simply not an accurate one.  You know, I can work on -- don't keep underestimating what you need, because I'm trying -- I'm going to try to give you what you need within reason.

But I thought -- if that was it, what you represented to me was it, and you might actually cut it back from 45 minutes to -- to where he gets to start his cross at -- his redirect at about 5:00 or a couple of minutes after 5:00, and he had 15 or 20

minutes of redirect, then we could get him out of here by 5:30.

I was feeling like that's fine and that'll be far better than to take however long it's going to take once everybody sleeps on it tonight and comes back tomorrow, and instead of taking 30 minutes with this witness, all of a sudden now we've got another two hours invested on this witness in the morning. I thought that was the better way to handle it.

And I'm still -- I still believed that there was the possibility that we could, after we deal with the objections, we could -- we could take Dr. Hurt's testimony and plug it in at the end of Friday, if that was what was going to happen.  We were going to bring in your witness in here on Friday morning, and that was the only witness you had.  But I can -- if Hurt was going to testify at all, that we could hear Hurt Friday.  I thought we could stay within that box.  That was where I was going with it.  I'm not trying to short-change anybody, but you guys told me yesterday afternoon, "Judge, we are feeling really good about this. We're going to get Cummings off tomorrow, maybe midafternoon."

Okay.  So I'm operating with the information I

I'm going to stop there.  Bring them back in. Let's hear what they have to say.

MR. GERAGHTY:  At this point, Your Honor � well, I thought that was the case at 4:30, and I thought I was going to be done in five minutes. But, I mean, it's taken me 40 minutes to get to that point that I told Your Honor we would take that break.  So -- and with all due respect, Your Honor, I made that statement after Your Honor told me that we were going to finish this witness today.  I then said, "Well, then give me five minutes, and I'll see if I can shorten things."

THE COURT:  Uh-huh.

(Jury entered the courtroom at 5:13 p.m.)

THE COURT:  Greg, would you take any notes they have?

THE COURT DEPUTY:  They have them.

THE COURT:  Just take them and let me see them, please.

Did you get my note?

(Laughter.)

Okay.  The jurors -- we have two more jurors who are unable to stay past 5:30.  So we're going to be breaking for the evening.

And so, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to be seeing you in the morning at the same time.  Thank you so much for your attention today.  Have a -- a safe drive home, and we'll see you first thing in the morning.  Same time.

(The jury left the courtroom at 5:14 p.m.)

THE COURT:  Sir, when he comes back -- you can step down.

THE WITNESS:  Okay.

THE COURT:  We're going to be discussing other things.  Okay.  We're going to be picking up from this point tomorrow with this witness.

Let's talk about whatever else we need to talk about at this time.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think one issue, both parties -- did they leave out of the back door or --

THE COURT:  Are they gone yet?

THE COURT DEPUTY:  No, sir.  I'm going to close this door.

I didn't really need them, as long as I hop okay.

MR. SCHULTZ:  One issue, I think both parties are concerned about, Your Honor, is Juror Schultz, and she was -- at one point today when all the jurors stood up, she was still kind of conked over. I noticed that she slept certainly through some of my presentation.  I know she slept through some of Mr. Geraghty's cross-examination, and I think at this point I'm not sure she would be fit to -- to sit in on a verdict because she's missed quite a bit of the evidence, and she certainly seems disinterested.

THE COURT:  Are you sharing data with me, or are you asking me for something?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, I was looking to Mr. Geraghty and trying to give me a nod, "Yeah, we agree" --

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't � I don't disagree with what Mr. Schultz said.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I --

MR. GERAGHTY:  I agree with Mr. Schultz � with what Mr. Schultz said.  It's not a double negative.

MR. SCHULTZ: Obviously, it's up to -- you know, it's up to the Court what to do about it, Judge.  I mean, I'm not necessarily asking that she

be excused.  But if somehow we lost a juror, I think I would probably object to her moving into the -- on the jury with two other alternates who have been taking copious notes and paying attention the whole time.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I � I don't think she should serve either.  I guess maybe discharging her gives the Court some concern that the jurors obviously notice that took place.

THE COURT:  Let me say, very simply, if the parties stipulate that this person who is one of the alternate jurors should be removed for cause and discharged at this time, then I would do that.

It would need to be a stipulation by the parties, because I -- it's not an issue that I want to engender any sort of appellate review on, because quite frankly, you know, it's kind of your job to keep her awake.  But, you know -- but I understand it's a challenge.

MR. GERAGHTY:  We both have failed apparently.

THE COURT:  But I -- you know, but I'm not going to make a ruling that will -- that would give fodder for any kind of appellate review, even discussion on it.

But from my standpoint if I'm asked to -- to --

if one of our jurors is unable to serve and I have to place her in there, then I would consider what you all have to say.

I do have a little bit of reticence, and I think that, Mr. Geraghty, that's what you were alluding to, is that if I do discharge her, it basically communicates to the other jurors this is how you get off, you know.

And they still think we're going until November 6th, you know, I have not shared with them anything about shortening of the trial.  So -- I --I wouldn't really want to send that message.

But I understand from your standpoint if you think that, hey, you know, it's sending a message to the other jurors that they really don't need to pay attention, they can just sleep through this thing and we're still going to keep them on here, and you don't like that message, then, you know, by stipulation I would -- I wouldn't hesitate to discharge her.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I share the concerns that Mr. Geraghty and the Court expressed, and they make sense to me.  And this may very well come to naught. If we don't lose a juror it's not going to make a difference, so why make an issue if it's not an

issue yet.

But we wanted to register where we're at, at the very least now.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. SCHULTZ: So it sounds to me if it becomes an issue, we cross that bridge when we get there.

MR. GERAGHTY:  May I have 30 seconds with Mr. Schultz?

THE COURT:  Absolutely.  Don't hurt him.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yeah.  I won't hurt him.  He's bigger than me.

(Conferring with Mr. Schultz outside of the hearing of the court reporter.)

MR. GERAGHTY: Your Honor, this may sound like an odd stipulation, but here's what we had in mind, and I believe Mr. Schultz agrees with this.

We think she should be technically discharged, but if you want to leave her here because of the concern that you and I both had, we could simply stipulate -- on behalf of Philip Morris, go on and stipulate that she is essentially discharged but we leave her here.  So that would move her -- the other two alternates would move into the No. 1 and No. 2 slots and we keep her here until Monday or Tuesday, when, after closings, you're going to let the

alternates go at that point anyway.

MR. SCHULTZ:  We didn't talk about a technical discharge, but he said how about if we make her the third alternate.  And I said if the Court is willing to do that it makes sense --

THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me just -- the simplest way to treat it directly is to say, all right, let's stipulate and agree that she would move from being alternate No. 1 to alternate No. 3.

It's highly unlikely she would then be required to serve.  But if there's a situation in which we have something terrible happen to, you know, three of our jurors and we have to -- we've got to have a sixth, because you want to stipulate to go forward with just five, then we would have to deal with that.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Are you guys okay with that stipulation?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.  And, again, I -- ultimately, Judge, I'm fine with that.  I'm fine if we just leave it as we just talked about before.  But I really would defer to your judgment on this.  You've done a lot more of this than I have so. . .

MR. SCHULTZ:  But I'm okay with doing that.

THE COURT:  Thanks.

MR. GERAGHTY: The only part of what Your Honor outlined that I can't agree to is we would not under any circumstances agree to only have five jurors.

THE COURT:  Correct.  Yeah.  And I don't anticipate either side would -- and we're going to try to keep a -- we picked three alternates for a reason.

But we do need to try to keep her interested and focused and awake if we can.  You know, I tried to draw attention to it with the bowtie comment that I -- again, I don't know how far that went.

Okay.  Tell me something else we need to talk about.

MR. SCHULTZ:  The only thing I believe that we have to talk about, Your Honor, as I indicated last night and I talked about it this morning, we intend at this point if Dr. Dorce testifies, as I presume she will, to call Dr. Hurt in rebuttal to her testimony specifically on her methodology.

And perhaps I -- I have noticed, Judge -- and I don't want to get into the details, but she's fine throwing out statistics and then when she's

cross-examined on them she will say, well, it's just something I've read somewhere.  I don't really -- her only reliance material is the DSM and depositions.  She'll say 85 percent of people quit, a third of people have withdrawal, and when you ask her, of course, she --

THE COURT:  Let me cut to the chase.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Sir.

THE COURT:  Let me cut to the chase here for you, okay?

I don't care about your strategy. I don't need to know it. Don't want to know it. But do you have a right to offer rebuttal evidence? Yes. Did you list a witness, Dr. Hurt? Yes. Did you say in your representations to the Court that Dr. Hurt would not give testimony specific to Mr. Danielson?  Yes.

So although you're bound by all those things, are you precluded from offering rebuttal testimony? No.  I mean, there's nothing in the pretrial, there's nothing in anything I've read that gives Philip Morris the right to come in and say don't allow you to have rebuttal.

You're welcome to have rebuttal.  But -- but the bench brief that they gave me, you know, it's --it's an accurate statement of the law, which says,

you know, it's not just a chance to rehash, it's not just a chance to go over things that he's already gone over just to remind him of the last thing the jury hears.  And in your case, it's even more circumscribed because, you know, a rebuttal witness couldn't -- Dr. Hurt as a rebuttal witness couldn't come in and then you change your position. He starts talking about Mr. Danielson, specifically Mr. Danielson's addiction, because you've represented to the -- to the defense and to the Court that you weren't -- you weren't bringing him as an expert for that; they didn't prepare for that reason.  And for that reason I would -- could not permit it.  It would be in violation of your representation and the pretrial, okay.

So -- but the defense has no right to ask me to say you can't bring in a rebuttal witness, and that's essentially what this motion to strike him as a rebuttal witness.

You're correct; he can't.  He can't just go back into things he's said already.  He has to address things that are brought out in your defense and -- on your case that -- that are not things that he has covered already.

while to bring him here.  You're going to have to make that decision.  That's a tactical decision you make.  Rather than you tell me all the things about Hurt that you think you need him for, you just need to understand that -- that the -- I think it's --it's articulated correctly.  There are limitations on a -- on what a rebuttal witness can do, and I will upon request of defense, and they now have requested it, I will impose those limitations.  And that's -- and you just have to decide if you anticipate there's going to be enough new stuff that he can address, that it's worth spending what you're going to spend to get it.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.  I understand, Judge.  And I wasn't trying to share strategy, only to let the Court know that this would not be cumulative and that it would be limited to what other experts are allowed to comment on other experts about.  But I understand.

THE COURT:  You understand where I am.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And, again, I'm not getting into the weeds of what she's going to say or what he's going to say.  But just be very clear, that, you know, you don't just -- don't get to bring him

And -- and also, there's that specific limitation that he can't -- that you -- you didn't offer him as an expert on Mr. Danielson's personal addiction.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, we understand that, Judge.

MR. GERAGHTY:  No, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Anything else tonight, Mr. Schultz?

THEREUPON, the following proceedings were had and taken at 8:37 a.m.:

K. MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D., MPH, having been previously duly sworn or affirmed, continued to testify under oath as follows:

(The witness retook the stand at 8:32 a.m., outside the presence of the Court.)

THE COURT DEPUTY:  All rise.  Circuit Court is reconvened.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Plaintiff have anything before we begin?

MR. SCHULTZ:  A couple of housekeeping matters, Judge.

THE COURT:  Have a seat, please.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think we -- one issue from the plaintiff, Judge.  We had -- they had an expert for Phase 2, if we get there, Dr. Richard Jupe, who is vice president at Altria Client Services.  I deposed him last year, a month or two ago.  They told me he may not be available for trial.  We're putting up a new expert.  I didn't want to fiddle with it, so I went up there and deposed him.

In the pretrial, we said if Dr. Jupe is unavailable, Dr. Lipowicz will testify.  I was told a week ago, "I'm 95 percent certain it's Jupe.  If

it changes, I'll let you know tomorrow."  That was a week -- last Thursday.

I've asked Mr. Geraghty this morning if they're firm on Jupe, and he said no.  I'm just going to ask -- I'm not going to work on it tonight, but I've got to work on it over the weekend.  And I'm just asking by tomorrow morning if I get a commitment who they're planning to call as a witness in the trial or, more specifically, whether Dr. Jupe has a conflict, because that was the condition under which Dr. Lipowicz would testify.

MR. GERAGHTY:  We'll do our best to try to respond within the time frame that Mr. Schultz just requested.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, Judge, I don't want them to do their best.  I want a commitment that I'll get an answer so I can start preparing for this witness because we've flip-flopped even in the last seven days.  If he takes the stand, it will be four days from now.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I understand that, and I � I'm confident we'll have an answer to him, but we are operating under a 48-hour rule.  The issue is --right -- Mr. Jupe was the witness we wanted to call. He has some scheduling issues.  Depending upon if we

got to a Phase 2 and when we got to Phase 2, that might make it impossible for him to be here when we got to that part of the case.

We have Pete Lipowicz.  He's deposed both of them, and I'll let him know as promptly as possible. If I can't tell you tomorrow for sure, I'll explain why I can't tell.  And -- and if Your Honor wants to take some action at that point, then I understand that so -- but I'm going to do my very best to answer his question by tomorrow.

THE COURT: End of the trial day tomorrow early enough, or is it too late?

MR. SCHULTZ: I will work on it between now and the trial date tomorrow, Judge. Hopefully, it won't be too late.

THE COURT:  Defense has until the end of trial day tomorrow to select someone other than Jupe. He's listed as your witness, as I understand it.

MR. GERAGHTY:  They're both listed, and we listed them both in an abundance of caution.  And I -- we explained to Mr. Schultz that the reason we listed Mr. Lipowicz -- Dr. Lipowicz in addition to Mr. Jupe was because of concerns about Mr. Jupe's schedule.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, close of business

tomorrow make your decision.  Doesn't matter to me certainly who you decide.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Right.

THE COURT:  But by failing to make a decision on either one of them, you may not be able to call either one, so make a call.  It doesn't matter to me, whichever one.  Hopefully, we'll know a little bit more about where we are in the trial and which -- I think that answers your question.  Thank you.

MR. SCHULTZ:  The next quick issue, Your Honor -- and just so we're clear on the record, they've indicated we're under a 48-hour rule for witness disclosure.  They told us last night, "We might call a couple of fact witnesses."  They did not identify them.  Mr. Geraghty told me this morning it would be, if they call anyone, Charley Dillard and/or Billy Smith.

And I think you told me, Mr. Geraghty, that you would let me know to suit today, this evening --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yeah.

MR. SCHULTZ:  -- so we can at least have a few hours to prepare for them.

We think our case will be done by lunch tomorrow, Judge, and I understand there's an issue

about Dr. Dorce and her wanting to come Friday.  And I told the defense that if she comes tomorrow, I'll be ready to cross her.  If they -- for her convenience and the Court's approval, if they want to bring her first thing Friday and we have to break early tomorrow as a result of that, the plaintiffs don't oppose that, if that's good for everyone. We're still ahead of schedule in terms of the three-week trial set.

THE COURT:  I, frankly, don't have confidence in our estimations of time right now, so I really can't respond it that.  I appreciate your simply announcing it on the record what you've communicated with defense counsel.  But as a practical matter, I -- I have -- at least a certain percentage of me believes that we're still going to be having Dr. Cummings on the stand by noon today, so I don't know where it's going.

I have to -- I've got to reset everything based upon where it actually is and not where you guys estimate it's going to be.  You know, that's no ill will or anything.  That's just the practical aspects of trying to take what you told me, make a plan, and being completely out of whack.  And so we'll just deal with what it is rather than what expectations

are.  Okay?

So what it is right now is we have this expert who's not yet done, and we'11 note he's done when he's done.  So on that standpoint, we'll go from there.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's it, Judge.  We're fine.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I don't think there's much more I need to say about that, given what Your Honor just said.  But given that Dr. Dorce is in West Palm Beach and her schedule, we can't put her on until Friday morning, but we'll be ready to put her on first thing Friday morning.

If we had any amount of time available on Thursday afternoon -- I appreciate what Your Honor said, that things are likely going to take longer than we've predicted -- we certainly could finalize jury instructions, verdict forms, and things of that nature so that we're ready to go with closings first thing on Monday.  And I don't see any reason why we're not on track to do that, as we discussed previously.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thanks.

Any other matters of business that I need to take care of?

MR. GERAGHTY:  One last issue, Your Honor.

With respect to Juror Schultz, who we talked about yesterday, we thought about it.  I discussed it with my client and, you know, my colleagues.  We believe you ought to just dismiss her rather than leave her around.

I realize that you may have -- I may have encouraged you in that particular direction yesterday.  But we think having someone who's not paying attention and who's sleeping sends the wrong message to those jurors, and all the other jurors are paying attention, are very attentive, appear to be very diligent taking notes, asking questions.

So I don't think there's any real reason to believe that all of a sudden if they see one juror go, they're going to say, "Oh, I meant to get off the jury.  I'm going to do the same thing Juror Schultz did."

How Your Honor wants to do that, the timing of it, what you say to the rest of the jurors obviously is within Your Honor's discretion, but that's what we would request.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.

MR. SCHULTZ: And my position hasn't changed, Judge, from yesterday. We're not stipulating that she ought to go.  If she perks up for the rest of

the trial and she ends up being the third alternate and we get there, you'll have to make a decision at that time whether she's fit to serve. But we don't see any urgent need to discharge her from the jury, and I share the concerns the Court expressed yesterday.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Let's bring the jury in, please.

THE COURT:  Thank you, everyone.  Please be seated.  Good morning to you.

Have you thought of anything you need to let us know that you believe might affect your ability to continue as a fair and impartial juror?  Has anything happened to you besides a 14-series -- or a 14-inning World Series game that might affect your ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror today?

I hope that you got to stay up and watch it, if you wanted to, but it's going to be a challenge

today as you hear the evidence.  But as I understand, nothing has happened to you, family, close -- close friends that would affect your ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror?

Thank you so much.  We're ready to proceed at this time.  We were in the cross-examination of Dr. Cummings by Mr. Geraghty for the defense. Mr. Geraghty, please. MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. FROM THE FLOOR:  Good morning.

CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Good morning, Dr. Cummings. A.   Good morning.

Q.   I don't know about you, but I conked out after the ninth inning so I would have the energy to power through this, and we'11 try to get you out of here quickly and get you home.

A.   I was well asleep before the ninth inning. Q.   Good for you.  Good for you.

To follow up on one or two things you mentioned yesterday, yesterday we talked about the fact that Lamar Danielson's father, Norman Danielson, had quit smoking in 1957.

And I thought I heard you say that you didn't recall what he said about why he quit smoking at that point in time.

A.   That's right.

Q.   Did -- did -- was your memory jogged at all last night? A.   No.

Q.   Okay.  Well, let me just ask you real quickly -- you have the depositions there. A.   Sure.

Q.   Take a look at Page 23 of Mr. Norman Danielson, Sr.'s deposition, and I'm just going to show you a very brief passage which, I believe, will refresh your memory.

A.   Okay.

Q.   It's -- take a look at Page 23, Line 16. A.   All right.

Q.   Let me just read this to you, and confirm for me that I'm reading it correctly.

This is Mr. Norman Danielson, Sr. "QUESTION:  Did you quit smoking at some point? "ANSWER:  Yeah, when I was 35.

"QUESTION:  And why did you quit when you were 35?"

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor -- I'm sorry,

Mr. Geraghty -- the same objection I had yesterday on the predicate as to Lamar Danielson.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm going to find the end of this question and see where it goes, and then I'll make a ruling. BY MR. GERAGHTY: Q.   Okay.

"Well, one reason, my wife" --Let me keep reading that. "And why did you quit when you were 35? "ANSWER:  Well, one reason, my wife didn't like it.

"QUESTION:  And why didn't your wife like it?" Then there's a follow-up question. "Did she tell you?"

And then Mr. Danielson responds:  "Why didn't she like it?

"QUESTION:  Yeah, did she tell you why she didn't like it?"

And his answer at the top of Page 24 is:  "She just didn't like the idea of smoking.  She didn't really have no reason for anything.  Still don't.  I mean, when she want something, she don't have to have a reason." Did I read all that correctly? A.   You did.

Q.   Does that refresh your recollection of what Mr. Danielson said in his deposition about the reason why he quit in 1957?

A. Sure. I didn't -- as I mentioned yesterday, I didn't really focus on other people's smoking behavior. I focused on Lamar's.

Q.   I understand that.

Now, let's move forward to just a few more things.  Yesterday we were talking about the fact that Mr. Danielson quit smoking for four months at one point. And let me just -- to remind everybody, I'm just going to put the medical record up on the screen. So I showed this to you yesterday. The record is dated November 6th, 1994, and I've highlighted the passage in yellow here, but in that second sentence it says, "He stopped for a period" --there we go.  "He stopped for a period of about four months but had started again and had smoked for some period of time," right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Now, you talked about withdrawal symptoms during your examination with Mr. Schultz.

Isn't it true that generally speaking, generally speaking, physical withdrawal symptoms from smoking will go away within about three weeks after a

person quits smoking?

A.   Yeah, except for weight gain and urges to smoke, those tend to hang on longer.  But things like being irritable and so on tend to dissipate over time.

Q.   All right.  Now, we talked yesterday about the fact that for that four-month period that Mr. Danielson quit he continued to drink beer.  We also talked about the fact that during that four-month period of time his wife, Mrs. Danielson, continued to smoke cigarettes.

You have written literature, haven't you, that instructs people who want to stop smoking, want to quit, that they should avoid alcohol, right?

A.   Yes.  Excessive alcohol use.

Q.   All right.  And you've written literature and pamphlets instructing smokers who want to stop or want to quit that they should avoid being around other cigarette smokers, right?

A.   If it helps them, yes.

Q.   Let me show you -- you mentioned that you were part of the New York Quitline, right?  You said that was one of the first quit line -- the first quit line ever established; is that correct?

A.   Right.  I established it and ran it for 11 years.

Q.   Okay.  This is, for the record, PMU53782.

You're familiar with "Break Loose, facts and tips to help you stop smoking"?

A.   Yes, I am.

Q.   Let me just show that.  That's the front cover of the pamphlet, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And I just want to draw your attention to a couple of passages.  This is -- I apologize, the pages are not marked, but --

A.   Could we have a full copy of it?

Q.   I -- I do.

I'm going to be real quick with this.  "So write down what you're going to do instead of smoking." I highlighted just a few things, but what I'm really focused on is the far right column.

At the top here it says, "Think about what you can do instead of smoking at these times."  And at the bottom you highlight, "Ask family members not to smoke around you," right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Right below that you say, "Don't drink alcohol"?

A.   We do.

Q.   And these are instructions that you and the quit line would give to smokers who want to stop

smoking, right?

A.   These are tips for people as they try to understand, you know, what triggers their smoking.

Q. Right. And then I highlighted "think about what makes you want to smoke"; those are examples of triggers you just mentioned, right?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And you mentioned being stressed or worried, being with other smokers, being in a restaurant or a bar?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Did I read that all correctly?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Let me show you one other... quickly here.

For the record, this is PMU53783.  This one's called Staying Tobacco-Free, also from the New York Quitline.  You're familiar with that one?

A.   I am.

Q.   Let me show you the front cover.

That's the front cover of the pamphlet?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Just a real quick passage here I want to show you.

It says "being around other smokers" at the top, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   I highlighted, it says, "Ask the smokers in your life to not smoke around you," correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And then at the bottom, let me -- let me move that up just a little bit.

It says, "Dealing with alcohol as a nonsmoker. Drinking alcohol makes it harder to control what you do," correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the more alcohol you drink, the more likely you are to become buzzed or intoxicated and then you kind of lose control over your decision making and judgment and things of that sort, right?

A.   Right.  If you were intoxicated you don't make necessarily good decisions.

Q.   And to help you remain a nonsmoker around alcohol, try these things.  Switch to nonalcoholic drinks.  Temporarily avoid going to places where you know there will be alcohol.

A.   Right.  We were giving some suggestions to people about how to refrain from smoking.

Q.   Right.  And these are commonsense tips, things that -- --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- right.

And you've written literature that talks about the sort of connection or relationship between alcohol drinking and cigarette smoking, right?

A.   I have.

Q.   Now, you prepared a report -- well, let me ask it this way:  You told us that you read all the depositions in the case, right, of all the individuals who had given a deposition and testified about what they knew about Lamar Danielson, correct?

A.   Yes, I did.

Q.   You took fairly extensive notes of those depositions?

A.   Right.  I think about 34 pages or so.

Q.   And you ultimately prepared a report that was, I believe, 31 pages long, right?  I think it's 31 but you can correct me.

A.   Yeah, it was 31.  You're right.

Q.   And isn't it true that nowhere in your 31-page report or in any of the notes that you wrote from the depositions did you once mention Mr. Lamar Danielson's drinking of beer and alcohol?

A.   Yeah, for good reason.  I could explain it if you'd like.

Q.   All right.

A.   Would you like me to explain it?

Q.   Let's move on; I want to switch gears here.

A.   Excuse me, would you like me to explain it?

Q.   Well, if Mr. Schultz wants to -- my point simply is, Doctor, that you just showed us some pamphlets where you advise people that they should not drink if they're trying to quit smoking, right?

A.   That's what you showed.

Q.   You wrote -- those pamphlets were written --THE COURT:  Is this a question, please? MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm sorry. THE COURT:  Thank you. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   You wrote those pamphlets before you got involved in this case?

A.   Sure I did.

Q.   Okay.  And my point simply is, in the report there's no mention anywhere that Lamar Danielson drank alcohol?

A.   Not in excess, that's true.  And I can give you an explanation.  Go right to the depositions, if you like, that talked about it.

Q.   I'll move forward so --

A.   That is fine.

fine, but I want to try to get finished with my examination as quickly as I can.

A.   I just thought you'd want an explanation.

Q.   Let's switch gears and let's talk about the Tobacco Industry Research Committee which later was renamed the Council for Tobacco Research, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And TIRC � I'll call it the TIRC or the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Was formed, as you described yesterday, to fund research?

A.   The limits of power was to fund research on smoking and disease, particularly cancer.  And that was the limit.  That was explained in their articles of incorporation.

Q.   Right.

A.   And to be select -- and to provide factual information to the public on smoking and health.  That was also in their limits of power.

Q.   Right.  Now, you said yesterday that the money that went to the TIRC --

A.   Uh-huh.

Q.   -- came from Philip Morris and other cigarette manufacturers ?

Q.   And the TIRC did fund research, right?

A.   They did.

Q.   They funded $500 million worth of research, correct?

A.   Right.  And 90 percent of it was not on smoking and health.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would move to strike that

answer as nonresponsive, Your Honor.

Q.   The TIRC funded research at universities all over the country, did they not?

Q.   They funded research at universities here in the State of Florida?

Q.   And whatever research was conducted by these researchers and academics, ultimately that would get published in what you, I think, described as peer-reviewed journals?

A.   Mostly that was true.  Mostly they would publish in peer-reviewed journals.  Occasionally you will get reports or conference proceedings and so on, which weren't peer reviewed.  But the majority of it was peer reviewed.  I have all the papers, over 6,000 of them.

Q.   Right.  And you said that there were 6,000 peer-reviewed articles.  Articles published in journals available to any academic or scientist or research --researcher here in the country. And �

A.   Well, I'm not so sure of that.  They funded research overseas, and you have to go back in time. There wasn't the Internet and so on.  But they were publishing in scientific journals and you can go to medical libraries and find that some of them were published in different languages.

Q.   Right, but these are publicly available journals?

A.   Today they are, because we've -- you know, they're available online through the archive.

Q.   Okay.  And you know that the TIRC has funded work that was conducted by individuals who later, for other work they did, went on to become Nobel Prize winners?

A.   Yes.  They funded, you know, some really excellent scientists all over the country, ten of whom I think ended up winning the Nobel Prize.  Not for their work funded through CTR, so that would be misleading to give that indication.  But they funded some pretty great scientists.

Q. I said very specifically that they received the Nobel Prize, not for the work that they did for CTR, but work that they later conducted; is that correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  Now, your former employer, Roswell Park, received funding from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee from the 1950s right on up until 1992?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And �

A.   Actually past that, although there was some issues with the funding after that.

Q.   Well, Fred Bach was your mentor at Roswell Park?

A.   Fred Bach was the person I replaced at Roswell Park.  When I came there in 1981 he had just retired. And he was a well-known tobacco scientist, and I took over his job and carried on the -- the work.

Q.   So Fred Bach was your predecessor at Roswell Park, and then when you arrived you ultimately replaced him?

A.   He had retired.  I came after he retired.  I had a few conversations with him by phone after he retired and I acquired a lot of the materials that he left behind in terms of his research that he was doing. He was doing excellent research.

Q.   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.

A.   He was quite an excellent researcher.

Q.   Right.  And you're not suggesting that Dr. Bach, your predecessor at Roswell Park, that any of the research that he did was fraudulent, are you?

A.   No.  No.

Q.   And you would agree that a lot of the research funded by the TIRC was excellent research?

A.   Sure.

Q.   We talked about the 6,000 publications and, in fact, I think you said on either Monday or yesterday morning -- I don't recall which -- but that 600 of the peer-reviewed publications sponsored by funding from the

TIRC were published and cited ultimately in Surgeon General's Reports on smoking and health?

A.   That's right.  They had to do with smoking and health.

Q.   Now, you talked also, I believe this was yesterday toward the end of your direct examination, about some research on nicotine that was being done by Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company with the Battelle labs --

A.   That's right.

Q.   -- about nicotine that was a year or two before the release of the Surgeon General's report in 1964, right?

A.   Actually the Battelle studies got going in 1959.

Q.   Well, within a couple of years before the release of Surgeon General's Report?

A.   Right.  The report came out in' 64.

Q.   Now, you know that the Tobacco Industry Research Committee actually sponsored research that led to a publication before the 1964 Surgeon General's Report where the researchers concluded that heavy cigarette smokers were addicted, right?

A.   I am familiar with that.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Let me show you the article.

This is, for the record, Your Honor, PMU1088. THE COURT:  Thank you. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q. It's a little tough to -- here, let me -- can you -- can everybody -- it's hard to read that. Let's focus on the top and then I'll go to the bottom.

The title of this article is Addictive Aspects in Heavy Cigarette Smoking by researchers Peter H. Knapp, MD, Charles Michael Bliss, and Harriet Wells, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And if we go to the bottom, it's very small, but it says "Reprinted from the American Journal of Psychiatry, April 1963," right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   So this is approximately nine months before the Surgeon General's Report was released in 1964?

A.   It is.

Q.   So let's go to just the first page, then, of the article.

So, again, that's the title of the article, Addictive Aspects in Heavy Cigarette Smoking, and there's a footnote, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   So let's go to the bottom and look at that

footnote 1.  Can everybody see this okay?

The Footnote 1 says, "Read:  This paper was read at the 118th annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association, Toronto, Canada, May 7th to 11th, 1962."

So that's taking us about a year and maybe

eight months before the Surgeon General's Report in

1964, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And it says, "This work" -- this paper and the research by these researchers -- "This work was supported, in part, by grants from the American Cancer Society and the Tobacco Industry Research Committee," correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So this was a -- the funding -- part of the funding for this article comes from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee?

A.   They're acknowledging the support that they got, as is common in --

Q.   And let me just --

A.   -- scientific publications.

Q.   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.  I'm going to just try to make this real quick.

A.   Okay.

Q.   There's a lot in this article.

You've read the article before, right?

A.   Right.  I think they had heavy -- 15 smokers that they studied.

Q.   And they say as one of their summary conclusions, No. 2, "Heavy cigarette smokers, thus, appear to be true addicts, showing not only social habituation, but mild physiologic withdrawal effects," correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So that was the conclusion from these researchers back in 1962 who received funding from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee?

A.   Well, '63 is when they published their paper, but yes, that's their conclusion.

Q.   They presented the paper in 1962.  That's why I said 1962.

A.   That's right, yeah.

Q.   All right.  Let's --

A.   It's been cited in Surgeon General's Reports.

Q.   Let's move forward.

You talked -- didn't spend a lot of time on this, but you talked about reconstituted tobacco, which you also, I think, referred to as man-made tobacco. Do you recall that?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Now, for a period of time, the tobacco that was in the cigarettes was primarily from the leaf of the tobacco, right?

A.   For a period of time --

Q.   Right.

A.   -- up until 1950s is when recon came in.

Q.   And that's -- that's where we're going.

There's the leaf and then you have a stem, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And in the removal of the leaf from the stem, you have the stem, the debris, and the dust that is left after the leaves are removed, correct?

A.   Or -- yes, but recon is also made from leaf. They -- the tobacco that's not sold is recycled.  So as it dries out on the shelf, it's not sold, they bring it back to the plant, they put it in, grind it up and extract it.  And they use basically a paper-making process, the same as making, you know, piece of paper out of wood pulp.

It's the same method that's used for using stem stalks, leaf recycled tobacco.  And they take the nicotine out and the color out through the extraction method.  And then they glue it with a little pectin to

hold it together and bind it, and then they reapply whatever they choose to reapply on it.

Q. All right. Well, you went well beyond -- my question was simply: In the removal of the leaf from the stem -- let me try again.

A.   Sure.

Q.   In the removal of the leaf from the stem, what you have left is the stem and the debris and the dust, correct?

A.   Sure.

Q.   All right.  And that stem and that debris and that dust for a long period of time was just kind of thrown out and never used as part of the process to manufacture cigarettes, right?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And so what happened was the companies --several companies, in an effort to take advantage of the stem and the debris and the dust that was previously thrown out, they came up with a process by which -- and you started to describe it -- the stems, the debris, the dust, that ordinarily would be thrown out, they spin that material, correct?

A.   That's right.  They spin it and put it through various chemical paths to extract the water-soluble material out, which includes nicotine and collier --

As I said they put out on --

-- and back in the '50s -- was to reapply the nicotine, what they call the rich brown liquor.  They spread it on the recon in a uniform way so you can more precisely control dosing.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would move to

strike the last part of that answer as nonresponsive

to my question.

THE COURT:  I would deny the request. MR. GERAGHTY:  All right. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Now, during the course of what we're just talking about now, when the liquid is reapplied, they reapply the nicotine, right?  That's what you just said?

A.   That's right.

Q. Now, the nicotine that is put back onto this paper sheet is less nicotine than what originally was taken out, right?

A.   Uh, it can be.

Q.   Isn't that right?

A.   There are processes of nicotine augmentation where they put more back, but generally if you only take out and then have measured and then put back, you lose some because nicotine and some of the other water-soluble components of the rich brown liquor will dissipate in the air, so you get some evaporation that

happens.

Q.   Isn't it true, Doctor, that through this process, generally speaking, there's less nicotine in the sheet afterwards than there was in the tobacco before?

A. Generally speaking that's true, but not always because I've seen, certainly, documents that talk about nicotine augmentation to the sheet.

Q. Right. You're not talking about Philip Morris documents, are you?

A.   No.  I think Philip Morris has done this with their cigarettes with regards to testing and controlling different amounts of nicotine that they did in some of those behavioral research studies that we talked about yesterday.

Q.   Sir, let me try one more time.

A.   Sure.

Q.   Isn't it true that you've testified under oath that through this process, generally, there's less nicotine in the sheet afterward than there is before?

A.   Yes.  I have testified to it, just like I just said to this jury, but sometimes they augment the nicotine.

nonresponsive, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I would deny the request. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Now, there are patents, right, where Philip Morris and other companies have described the process by which they make this reconstituted tobacco, and these patents are in exquisite detail and filed with the U.S. Patent Office, right?

A.   Yeah.  I've probably accumulated about 800 different patents that have to do with nicotine-controlling cigarettes dating back to the 1920s, with nicotine extraction.  Not all are Philip Morris, but there are many, and the patents are in exquisite detail.  They have descriptions and drawings, and they often cite prior patents.

Q.   Right.  And just so it's clear, a patent is --this is an invention, right?

A.   Uh-huh.

Q.   And if you want to protect that invention, the federal government has a process by which you have to file the patent with the government at the United States Patent Office, and you have to describe what your invention is, how it works, so that everybody's on notice that you have come up with this invention, right, and you can protect it if need be?

A.   Sure.

Q.   All right.  And I think you said -- these patents go back to at least the 1950s, but I think you've also said some go even further than that, correct?

A.   The earliest ones on nicotine extraction go back to the 1920s.  As I said, I have a collection of patents.  I've written articles on the patents and so on.

Q.   Now, the Surgeon General has said that reconstituted tobacco is a method of reducing the tar and nicotine in cigarette smoke, right?

A.   They have said that.  They were testing just recon, the extracted tobacco, and if you burn that versus tobacco leaf just blended, without the recon, you do get some differences in the type of tar and the carcinogens that are in it.  They both produce cancers, but less cancer with the just recon.

Q.   Let me try again:  The Surgeon General has said that reconstituted tobacco is a method of reducing tar and nicotine in cigarette smoke, yes or no?

A.   As I answered before, yes.

Q.   And the cigarette companies discuss with the national -- National Cancer Institute the process by which they made reconstituted tobacco, right?

A.   They did with other scientists at the National

Cancer Institute.

Q.   Right.  And so the Surgeon General has said that the use of reconstituted tobacco is a good thing because it brings down the level of tar in cigarette smoke, right?

A.   No.  I don't think they said that.

Q.   You don't think they said that?

A.   I -- I can tell you I'm familiar with the '81 Surgeon General's Report where they talk about lower tar.  I'm not sure they concluded it's a good thing. Maybe they did, but I don't recall that as a conclusion of the '81 Surgeon General's Report.  If you can find that as a conclusion -- because there are conclusions that they draw -- I stand corrected.

Q.   All right.  Well, haven't you said that under oath previously?

A.   I've said what I just explained to this jury: There's a reference to the studies that were done testing recon versus regular tobacco, that they produce different levels of carcinogens in mouse painting experiments, and that was what re- -- was reported. They didn't say it was a good thing.  In fact, I don't think the Surgeon General has ever been saying that smoking or constructing cigarettes is a good thing. MR. GERAGHTY:  I would move to strike that

THE COURT:  I would deny the request.  Thank

you. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   You're -- Dr. Cummings, tar is what causes the cancer, right?

A.   Well, nicotine is what causes people to get exposed repeatedly to the 9,000 chemicals, 60 known carcinogens in every puff of a cigarette, so I have stated that nicotine is the indispensable link that ultimately leads to the people developing serious disease, lung cancer being one of them.

Q.   Does tar not cause cancer?  Is that what you're telling us?

A.   Tar has carcinogens in it.

Q.   Okay.  Tar causes cancer, yes or no?

A.   Tar causes cancer if you get enough of it.

Q.   We showed -- we showed the jury yesterday the pictures from the mouse skin painting study, and we actually showed a video where they -- you described this to the jury.  They --

A.   That's right.

Q.   They took that smoking machine, and they condensed that smoke into tar, and that tar was what caused the tumors on the backs of those mice?

A. Yeah. Tar is a euphemism for the particulates in tobacco smoke which, as I pointed out, contains many classes of carcinogens.

Q.   All right.  Let's -- let's switch gears.

Yesterday you talked about some research by a Dr. Leo Abood.  Do you recall that?

A.   I do.

Q. And you testified that his research was funded by the Council for Tobacco Research, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you showed the jury -- I think on Monday you may have shown one 1978 document written by Dr. Osdene, but I believe yesterday you might have shown one or two other documents that referred to Dr. Abood, right?

A.   Yes, I think there was another one.

Q.   Do you recall that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  And you told the jury yesterday that his research was, quote, shut down, right?

A.   Yes, it was.

Q.   Okay.  Well, you also told the jury that there are millions of pages of industry documents that have been indexed and made available, and that they are all word-searchable, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Have you found or seen that Dr. Leo Abood later worked for the National Institute on Drug Abuse?

A.   Yes.  Sure, I knew Dr. Abood.

Q.   Dr. Abood, right?

A.   Right.  I knew him well.

Q.   You're familiar --

A.   I was --

Q.   -- with him?

THE COURT:  One at a time, please.

A.   He did receive funding from NIDA, that's right. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Okay.

A.   Okay.

Q.   So Dr. Leo Abood worked for the National Institute on Drug Abuse, did he not?

A.   He did.  He got grant funding and also worked for them for a period of time.

Q.   And that was the definition of addiction that you showed the jury on Monday, correct?

A.   That's their definition, yes.

Q.   Okay.

A.   Right after relapsing disorder.

Q.   He worked with the NIDA just a few years after the documents you showed yesterday and Monday, did you

MR. GERAGHTY:  For the record, this is PMU1424. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

It says, "Behavioral and biochemical studies in rats after chronic exposure to nicotine," correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And Dr. Leo Abood is one of the writers of this, correct?

A.   Yes, he is.

Q.   You talked about -- he was doing research on nicotine analogues.  That's what his CTR research --

A.   Not only that but he was actually doing, you know, neuro- -- basically brain effects, you know, looking at receptor effects in the brain.

Q. Dr. Cummings, didn't you mention yesterday and on Monday that he was doing nicotine analogue research? You described what a nicotine analogue was, didn't you?

A.   Yes.  That was one of the things I read from the document from Philip Morris.

Q.   So let's just -- the -- the first sentence says, "Since nicotine is the major constituent in cigarette smoke responsible for the reinforcing effects of smoking, studies on behavioral and pharmacologic tolerance of nicotine are of considerable interest to the health consequences of smoking."

Did I read all that correctly?

A.   You did.  It's a true statement.

Q.   And let's go to Page 351.  This is in a government publication, right?

A.   Yes, it is.

Q.   Page 351 -- oop -- it says, "Binding of nicotine analogues and other agents to rat hepatocytes using either negative negative or plus negative 3H nicotine."

Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   Okay.  So what's being described in this NIDA publication, a government publication, is work that had been done on nicotine analogues, correct?

A.   Yes.  That's the work he was doing.

Q.   Let's go to Page 352.  That was the work he was doing, right?

A.   Uh-huh, along with opiate work.

Q.   He writes here, "It is noteworthy that the relationship of binding affinity of various nicotine analogues and hepatocytes agrees with the relative psychotropic potency of the analogues," right?

A.   Right.

So the first two references to this chapter that Dr. Abood wrote is to the earlier research that he had done that had been published in scientific journals, right?

A.   Sure.

Q.   We've got a reference to an '81 article and a 1983 article, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And then let's look at the acknowledgments. MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay.  Struggling with this

thing here today. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   This research was supported by a number from the National Institute on Drug Abuse and a grant from the Council for Tobacco Research, which was previously the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And it was Leo Abood as one of the authors?

A.   Right.  This is true.

Q.   So just so we're clear, here we have a 1984, just a couple of years after the documents that you showed --

A.   Uh-huh.

the Council for Tobacco Research had funded this publication where Dr. Abood is describing nicotine analogues, right?

A.   That's true.  He's summarizing his research. He's doing what is normal, as to acknowledge the funding where that research came from.  And I can explain exactly what the Philip Morris documents were talking about with Dr. Abood's research, if you'd like.

Q.   Well, let's move forward, and let's take a look at the 1988 Surgeon General's Report.

A.   Sure.

Q.   The 1988 Surgeon General's Report is the one that concluded that nicotine -- excuse me -- that nicotine is addictive, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Cigarette smoking is addictive.  Nicotine is the substance in cigarette smoke that causes the addiction, right?

A.   No debate at that point, except from the companies.

Q.   Right.  And you said that the research that was cited in the Surgeon General's Reports was valid and peer-reviewed research, right?

A.   Well, it was peer-reviewed research.  That's what the Surgeon General does.  I mean, you can always

It says, "The editors acknowledge with gratitude the following distinguished scientists, physicians, and others who lent their support in the development of this report by coordinating manuscript preparation, contributing critical reviews of the manuscript, or assisting in other ways." And Leo Abood is cited, correct?

A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   And I'm just going to refer you, then, to --this is Page 57 of the 1988 Surgeon General's Report. And this paragraph says, "Nicotine analogues have been studied for discriminative stimulus effects by using animal models," right?

A.   True.

Q.   And then they cite a series of papers:  1978, '86, '85, '87.

And then down here it says "Kanne and others, 1986, and Abood and Grass!, 1986, evaluated two nicotine analogues including a new radio- -- radioligand to study brain nicotinic receptors."

A.   That's right.

Q.   Did I read that correctly?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, let's switch gears, again.  I'm going to move forward.

Yesterday you talked about a dispute between the Dow Chemical Company and Philip Morris over Nicorette Gum, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And at the time of the document that you showed the jury yesterday, Dow Chemical manufactured and distributed Nicorette Gum, right?

A.   In the United States.

Q.   Right.  Dow Chemical at that same time was also a supplier to Philip Morris of certain ingredients that are used in the manufacture of cigarettes, right?

A.   Yes, certain additives that are put in tobacco.

Q.   So Dow Chemical and Philip Morris at that time had a business relationship, did they not?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   And as you described, by reviewing the document, Philip Morris was unhappy about the way Dow Chemical was marketing and promoting Nicorette Gum?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you showed in the documents that representatives of Philip Morris had discussions with representatives of Dow Chemical?

A.   Yeah, we only showed one.  There are a series of documents, but we only showed the one from 1984.

Q.   Okay.  Now, Philip Morris never threatened to sue Dow Chemical in connection with this dispute over Nicorette Gum, did they?

A.   I'm not aware that they threatened to sue them.

Q.   Philip Morris didn't ask Dow Chemical to pull Nicorette Gum off the market, right?

A.   No.

Q.   And, in fact, you know that Nicorette Gum has remained on the market throughout the entire time that Philip Morris and Dow Chemical had this dispute reflected in the document you described?

A.   Nicorette has been on the market since 1984, and I believe that Merrell Dow sold off their rights to it to another company a few years later.

Q.   Well, you know that the Dow Chemical Company

got approval from the Food and Drug Administration to distribute Nicorette Gum, correct?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   Because it was considered a drug, Dow Chemical had to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration before they could market and promote it to the public?

A.   Yes.  In order to make a claim about a drug, you have to validate that claim, so you have to show that it works and that the claim that it will help you stop smoking is accurate and that the drug is also safe. So safety and efficacy are what the drug approval process is all about at FDA.

Q.   Now, you know that Nicorette Gum proved to be a very successful product, right?

A.   It did.

Q.   There are references in the 1989 Surgeon General's Report describing, in fact, how successful it was, correct?

A.   There are.

Q.   Let me show you that.  This is Exhibit PMU1497. This is just a cover first, right, the '89 Surgeon General's Report?

A.   Yes.

You've actually -- I think you've told --you've said that you wrote this particular section of the Surgeon General's Report, did you not?

A.   I did -- I did the section on the History of Stop Smoking Treatments for Smokers that was contained in the report.

Q.   Right.  So you know, then, the Surgeon General in this report, and it may have been your exact words, described Nicorette Gum as one of the fastest selling prescription products ever introduced?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And in the Surgeon General's Report, it says that Dow had a massive promotional campaign?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So let's take a look at what you wrote.

A.   Right.

Q.   This is Page 42 9.

Let me read what's -- let me read the lower paragraph first.  Can everybody read that okay?

It says, "As part of its promotional campaign, Merrell Dow has supported many medical symposia on smoking, underwritten the cost of a newsletter on smoking cessation sent over to 40,000 physicians annually, and helped support the development and distribution of training materials on smoking cessation

for health professionals."

Did I read that part correctly so far?

A.   You read it correctly, although there's an error.

Q.   Okay.

A.   And the error is that that newsletter was only produced one time.

Q.   Okay.

A.   And I didn't know why until I found the documents from Merrell Dow and Philip Morris.

Q.   All right.

Well, let's take a look at what it says above that.  "The result of this massive promotional campaign was one of the fastest selling prescription products ever introduced," right?

A.   That's true.

Q.   And sales for Nicorette Gum were 42 million dollars in 1984, the first year it was on the market, right?

A.   Yes.  It shows there's a huge demand for people trying to quit smoking.  They're struggling to do so. They're looking for anything that will help, and it was the fastest -- as they said, fastest selling prescription product that ever came into market at that time.

Q.   $46 million in sales in 1985?

A.   That's right.

Q.   $54 million in sales in 1986, $60 million in sales in 1987; right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   So despite what you told the jury yesterday, sales for Nicorette Gum rose every single year from the year it was introduced in 1994 throughout the entire period of time that Philip Morris and Dow Chemical were having this dispute, correct?

A.   Incorrect.  I didn't tell the jury anything about the sales of Nicorette yesterday.  I just talked about what the conversation had been between Philip Morris and what they did do, which was suspend their purchasing of those chemicals, because they were displeased with the marketing of Nicorette.

And I told the jury also that there's another letter in 1985 where they reinstituted that, and I explained some of the rationale that was in that memo from Philip Morris as to why they reinstituted.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I move to strike that answer as

nonresponsive, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  If you can approach and show me

where he said that sales declined, I'll be glad to

strike the last.

MR. GERAGHTY:  That's not the � let me try

again.  That wasn't the question I asked him,

Your Honor. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   My question was that sales for Nicorette Gum rose every single year from the year it was introduced in 1984 throughout the entire period of time that Philip Morris and Dow Chemical had these discussions; isn't that true?

A.   Yes.  Up until 1987, that's true.

Q.   Right.  And Nicorette has never been pulled from the market?

A.   No.

Q.   And, in fact, in 1980 -- 1996, it became an over-the-counter product, right?

A.   True.

Q.   Okay.  Let's -- let's switch gears, then, and you talked about -- you talked about a concept of a low-nicotine or reduced-nicotine cigarette, right?

A.   I'm not sure I did.

Q.   Well --

A.   But I'd be happy to talk about it.

Q.   Let me -- didn't Mr. Schultz ask you several questions that said have you ever seen any document that shows that Philip Morris did anything to reduce the

addictiveness of its products.  Remember that question? A.   Yes. Q.   Okay.

Now, you know that Philip Morris has developed very low and no nicotine cigarettes, has it not?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, can we approach on this?

THE COURT:  Yes.  Briefly.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I intend to keep it brief, Your Honor.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MR. SCHULTZ:  They filed a motion that said he can't say low-nicotine cigarettes are nonaddictive. My concern is if he goes in and asks this question, he's just equated low-nicotine cigarettes with not being addictive.

My question to Dr. Cummings was did they ever try to reduce the addictiveness.  Mr. Geraghty is about to say didn't we make low-nicotine cigarettes. My only point is this, Your Honor:  I think that opens the door for me to ask Dr. Cummings are low-nicotine cigarettes addictive, which they've told the Court I shouldn't be allowed to ask.

And I'm simply saying it's -- before we get

there, our position is we'll open to the door to that question.  No nicotine, I think, is a separate question.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, that's � the question that I believe Mr. Schultz asked yesterday was -- he asked him several times yesterday and on Monday which was, did Philip Morris do anything in an effort to reduce the addictiveness of its products.

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's right.

MR. GERAGHTY:  That's a very, very broad question.  My cross is very focused.  There's a particular brand of cigarettes.  They made a denicotinized cigarette.  I'm not going to ask him his personal opinion of whether he believes what the threshold is or whether that cigarette was or was not potentially addictive.

My question -- the purpose of my question simply is, Your Honor, to say, given the very broad brush with which Mr. Schultz and Dr. Cummings painted, I should at least be allowed to ask him isn't it true that they marketed a denicotinized cigarette, they launched it, it was out there, and if they were criticized for doing that.

That's all I'm going to try to do.  I'm not going to get into any of the science.  It's a

factual-based series of questions.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I don't oppose the question, Your Honor.  I'm only trying to avoid a mishap when I stand back up on redirect.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And say what?

THE COURT:  Well, if you introduce the fact that they sold a denicotinized or low-nicotine cigarette, then he can garner -- if you don't inquire about, well, what was the result of that, did they continue it, I think you can certainly inquire about what the doctor knows.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I couldn't hear that.

THE COURT:  (Inaudible) is a low-nicotine cigarette, not -- not addictive.  Those are questions he can ask.  If you -- if you start talking about low nicotine and no nicotine cigarettes or denicotinized cigarettes, isn't he -- I mean, why is that -- I don't understand why that's not fair redirect on that question.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Uh-huh.  Well, I'm not going to ask him scientifically whether he thought they were nonaddictive or less addictive.  I'm only going to ask him about specific factual questions.  I think that would only allow follow up on that very discrete issue and nothing beyond that.

THE COURT:  Well, the difference is the impression is -- the -- the limitation that you're trying to put on the question -- and I understand --it's good lawyering -- that you're trying to put on the question, but the impression that's being left for the jury and what is going to be argued to the jury about how they are to interpret that, and the inference is there to draw from that.

And so I think that, because of the potential inferences that they could draw from that, that he's entitled to inquire -- to clarify how -- so that's the --

A.   Okay.  We'll be happy with that.

Q.   I don't think anybody is going to be disappointed with that.

Okay.  Doctor, back in 1987 or 1988, thereabouts, you wrote a pamphlet that tells people what to expect when they try to quit smoking, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  The pamphlet is called "The Smart Move"?

A.   Correct.

Q.   This is, for the record, PMU8562.  Could I have the ELMO?  Thank you.  Is that the front cover of the pamphlet there?

A.   It is.  Front and back, actually.

Q.   Front, right.  It's sort of in a smaller booklet form, so we've got the front cover and back cover?

A.   It was designed to be cheap so they could put it in an envelope and mail it to people.

Q.   Okay.  And you wrote this in about 1987 or '88?

A.    '87 is when I wrote it and I think the Cancer Society first put it out in 1988.

Q.   Right.  And this is a booklet you wrote and you wrote it for the American Cancer Society, correct?

A.   That's right.

A.   It's a readiness quiz to see if they're ready to make a quit attempt.

Q.   And people have to be ready, meaning they have to decide they're ready to quit smoking?

A.   Obviously you've got to decide you're going to quit smoking in order to quit smoking.

Q.   Okay.  So this is one of the pages.  It says getting ready to stop.  That's what you mentioned?

A.   That's right.

Q.   It says, "Do you have what it takes to stop smoking?  There is no magic cure that can help you stop. Take this short quiz to find out if you have what it takes."

A.   That's right.

Q.   Question 1 says, "Do you want to stop smoking," right?

A.   Right.

Q.   "Are you willing to make some changes in your daily routine?  Are you willing to put up with some uneasy moments after stopping?"  Correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And I didn't highlight this, but right below that you say, "If you can answer yes to all three

questions, you can stop smoking," correct?

A.   That's right.  Doesn't mean that they will be successful in staying off, but, you know, they're ready to make a quit attempt.  And that's what I explained to smokers when we used it in our clinics.

Q.   Well, what you say here is, "If you can answer yes to all three of these questions, you can stop smoking," right?

A.   I'm telling you what I tell the smokers.  I said, you know, if you can answer yes to these questions, you're ready to make a quit attempt.  Great. It doesn't mean you're going to be successful.  In fact, we even talk about relapse and making slips and how to pick yourself back up after a slip because that's so common as part of the process.

Q.   I would move to strike as nonresponsive.

My question simply is, if you can answer yes to all three questions, you can stop smoking?

THE COURT:  He has answered the question that

that's -- yes, that appears in the book, the book

which he wrote, which was then published by the

American Cancer Society.  The remainder of the

response will be disregarded. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Okay.  And you believe what you wrote here,

right?

A.   I believe what I just said to this jury.

Q.   You believe that although it can be difficult to quit smoking, that any smoker can quit smoking, correct?

A.   They can make a quit attempt.  It doesn't mean they're going to be successful.  As I told the jury yesterday, only about 3 to 4 percent of people are successful in quitting in a given year.

Q. Let me try again. Doctor, you believe that although it can be difficult to quit, any smoker can quit smoking --

A.   They can make a quit attempt.

Q.   -- right? Right. (Pause.)

MR. GERAGHTY:  May I approach, Your Honor? THE COURT:  You may. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Here you go, Dr. Cummings (handing).

A.   Thank you.

Q.   I've handed you a transcript from a case called McRae.  Do you see that?

A.   I do.

Q.        The   date   is  March   13th,   2012,   correct?

BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   "And you tell smokers if they can answer yes to these questions, then 100 percent of them can succeed in quitting, do you not?  Making a quit attempt, yes.  Not overcoming their nicotine addiction.  In fact, most of the people that have gone to my clinics and received this guide or called our quit line we know right up front are going to make a quit attempt and relapse back. It's a journey for people and they have to overcome their nicotine addiction.  The guide goes on to talk about some of the steps and processes and not to get discouraged.  It's a self-help guide to help people quit."

Did I read all that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   Okay.  Now, let's go over these questions.

This first question here, No. 1, do you want to stop smoking, that's a question about motivation, right?

A.   All of them are about motivation.

Q.   Okay.  But the first question is about motivation, is it not?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And it takes motivation to quit smoking, doesn't it?

A.   Yes.

Q.   If you're not motivated to quit, you're not going to quit smoking, are you?

A.   Obviously.

Q.   And if someone doesn't want to quit smoking, they are not going to quit, correct?

A.   True.

Q.   And quitting smoking takes persistence, right?

A.   It does because of the way the product is engineered.

Q.   Doctor, let me ask you again.  Quitting smoking takes persistence, does it not?

A.   Unfortunately, it does.

Q.   Persistence is important in quitting smoking, right?

A.   It -- it -- it is hard to quit smoking because of the way the product is engineered.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Let me � Your Honor, I would

move to strike that answer as nonresponsive. THE COURT:  I would deny the request. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Persistence is important to quitting smoking, yes or no?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, there's -- the second question says, "Are you willing to make some changes in your daily routine,"

right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And that's an acknowledgment that if you're going to stop smoking cigarettes, you need to make some changes in your behavior and your lifestyle, right?

A.   It's an acknowledgment that that helps.  It's an indication, yes, that you're ready to stop.

Q.   And the third question says, "Are you willing to put up with some uneasy moments after stopping," correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And that is a reference to withdrawal symptoms?

A.   Yes.  We're trying to educate people about expectations of what to expect when they quit.

Q.   And you describe some of the withdrawal symptoms in the pamphlet, right?

A.   We do.

Q.   We've already talked about that so I won't replow that ground.

A.   Okay.

something else here.

You -- you talked -- and, I think, mainly yesterday you had a number of slides where you and Mr. Schultz talked about documents that said, why do people smoke?  Do you recall that?

A.   Sure.

Q.   I think he actually had that as his tag line, why do people smoke.  Let me just show this real quick. Do you recall these?

A.   I believe that was the tag line in Helmut Wakeham's presentation to the board of directors.

Q.   Okay.  But you wrote "why do people smoke," correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And you showed a number of documents, but many of them were from the 1970s and 1980s regarding a behavioral research program, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you talked about that behavioral research program?

A.   Right.  I think we showed some annual reports and some of the work they were doing.

Q.   And that behavioral research program was headed by a man.  You told the jury his name was William Dunn, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you know that in 1973, Bill Dunn and Philip Morris actually published a book in 1973 that discussed why people smoke cigarettes, right?

A.   I'm familiar with the book, Motives and Incentives to Smoke.  It was a compilation of a conference that was held, and he was the editor of that book, and so I'm very familiar with the book.

Q.   Right.  But the subject of the book is on why people smoke, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   All right.

A.   And various theories were presented at this conference from both academic people as well as people inside the industry.  And I'm familiar with the book.  I don't think it was published by Philip Morris, just so you're correct, I --

Q.   It was --

A.   -- think it was published by CTR, actually, who funded it.

Q.   Yeah.  It was -- the editor of the book was William L. Dunn, Jr., right?  He was the head of the Behavioral Research Program at Philip Morris, which you discussed yesterday with Mr. Schultz?

A.   That's true.

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'll ask my questions and we can address that.

A.   Correct.

A.   That's correct.

Q.   Let's explain the background of the book to the jury.

So there was a conference held in Saint Martin, an island in the Caribbean, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   In 1972?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And they invited a whole bunch of experts on issues of addiction and nicotine to attend that conference, correct?

A.   On human smoking behavior, yes.

Q.   Right, human smoking behavior.

And -- here we go.  Let's take a look at the people who were -- these were people not affiliated with Philip Morris for the most part, right?

A.   For the most part, that's true.  I mean, there were academics.  There were people from the Department of Agriculture, I believe, and then some tobacco industry folks.

Q.   And then what happened was everybody who was invited to attend this -- this conference in Saint Martin in 1972 wrote a paper, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   They presented their papers at the conference,

right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the papers were all directed to the issue of why do people smoke cigarettes, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And all of the papers that were presented at the conference in 1972 were then compiled and edited and put into this book (indicating) and published by William Dunn?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   So let's look at some of the people who attended the conference and wrote the papers that are in the book.

So I realize it's a little tough to read for the ladies and gentlemen of the jury, but I just highlighted -- we have people that are from Harvard University, Albert Damon, correct?

A.   Right.

Q.   Right below that is Edward F. Domino from the University of Michigan?

A.   Correct.

Q.   That's your alma mater, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   There's Bill Dunn right below him, correct?

A.   That's right.

yesterday.  He's from Philip Morris.  He worked under Dr. Dunn.  So that's, you know, an array of people.

Q.   So the conference where these people all originally presented their papers was not a secret or a hidden conference, right?

A.   No.  It was an invited conference --

Q.   Okay.

A.   -- put on by CTR, and they did put out the book.  I believe Dr. Dunn did a presentation on sort of plugging the book at the -- at a primarily tobacco CORESTA conference in Virginia in 1972; although his speech in the CORESTA conference didn't appear in the book.

MR. GERAGHTY:  All right.  I would move to

strike all of that as nonresponsive, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Now, let's talk -- let's look at some of the articles that were written.  And I'm going to talk about Dr. Murray Jarvik here --

A.   Okay.

Q.   -- first.

Dr. Murray Jarvik is known as one of the persons who invented the nicotine patch, right?

Q. Okay. So let's just take a look -- before we get to all that, let's go to the next page. There's a little preface that's written by Bill Dunn, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And then if we look at the second page of the preface it says, "This conference was sponsored by the Council for Tobacco Research USA, Inc.," signed by William L. Dunn, Jr., December 1972?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Okay.  So let's take a look at some of the articles that were submitted and that were published in this book by Bill Dunn.

A.   Okay.

Q.   It says neur- -- "Neuropsychopharmacology of Nicotine and Tobacco," right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   "Further Observations on Nicotine As the Reinforcing Agent in Smoking," that's the article by Murray Jarvik, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Below that it says, "Nicotine-related Neurochemical Changes," right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And it talks -- it's got specific sections about brain, indoleamine changes, cellular specificity

You talked about EEG changes, right, in smokers?

Q.   So that's a flavor of some of the articles here.

A. I think you picked out the ones on nicotine. The others, you know, deal with other theories of why people smoked at the time.

Q.   Oh, I may.

A.   Personality factors.

Q.   There's all sorts of stuff in here, right?

A.   Exactly.

Q.   "The Effects of Smoking on Mood Change." "General Comments on Problems of Motivation Relevant to Smoking."  "Some Commonalities Among the Preceding Reports of Studies on the Psychology of Smoking."

There's -- there's 17 or 18 -- there's 21 different articles in here, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   So let's look.  Murray Jarvik is the man that invented the nicotine patch.  His article, "Further Observations on Nicotine As the Reinforcing Agent in Smoking," in this chapter in his particular article, Dr. Jarvik wrote that, "Nicotine is a drug and that smoking is nicotine-seeking behavior," correct?

A.   Yes.  That was his view at that point.

Q.   He said that, "Nicotine stimulates the reward center of the brain," did he not?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Mr. Geraghty, if I could look at

it just so I could see the chapter you're

cross-examining on, please.

MR. GERAGHTY:  It's Chapter 3.  Let me give you

this one.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yeah, I'll find it.  Thank you. MR. GERAGHTY:  You're welcome. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Let me make sure.  They're in the chapter that Dr. Jarvik wrote.  He said that, "Nicotine is a drug and that smoking is a nicotine-seeking behavior," correct?

A.   I believe he did.

Q.   He said that, "Nicotine stimulates the reward center of the brain," right?

A.   I don't dispute that he said that.

Q.   He told the reader that, "There are nicotine receptors in the brain," right?

A.   He may have.  I don't -- you know, I don't have the article memorized, but he certainly was a believer that nicotine is a factor driving smoking behavior.

Q.   Well, do you recall that he told the reader in his article that, "There are nicotine receptors in the brain"?

A.   I don't recall that.  I'm sorry.

Q.   You don't recall that?

A.   No.

Q.   He told the reader that, "Nicotine is a powerful reinforcer"?

A.   He may have said that.  I don't dispute it.  I just -- if you want to show me the article, that's fine. That would refresh my memory.  I haven't read the articles in the book in --

Q.   At the risk of --

A.   --a few years.

Q.   At the risk of upsetting everybody, I'm not going to do that.

But all of that is contained in this book, right?

A.   I don't recall whether all of that is, but, you know, there's the flavor of the book, I think, is well-described from the titles that you've went through.

Q.   You can -- and as we talked about, you can go down to your public library here in Pensacola and check the book out?

A.   Well, I'm not sure that it was in the Pensacola library, but yeah, the book has been available in other libraries, and I can't tell you which ones.

Q.   The book has been cited several times in Surgeon General's Reports over the years, has it not?

A.   It certainly has.

Q.   Including the 1988 Surgeon General's Report?

A.   Yes, it was.

Q. And the editor of this book was Mr. William Dunn, the head of the Behavioral Research Program at Philip Morris, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   He published this in 1973?

A.   Exactly.

Q.   Nothing in this book was secret, was it, Dr. Cummings?

A.   Nothing -- the book was in the public domain. I'll grant you that.

I want to start with this book.  You said you have a copy of the book?

A.   I do.

Q.   I want to start with -- the original question asked to you was, aren't you aware that Philip Morris and William Dunn published this book.  Do you remember that question?

A.   Yes, I remember that question.

Q.   Now, I've never seen this book until 15 minutes ago, but if you look on the inside cover, if I can get that focused, is the book published by Philip Morris?

A.   No.

Q.   And was the book published by William Dunn?

A.   No.

Q. Now, he -- was the editor of the book. And Mr. Geraghty talked a bit about an article by Murray Jarvik?

A.   Right.

Q.   That was the fellow who was involved with the nicotine patch?

A.   That's correct.

Q.   And this is Mr. Jarvik or Dr. Jarvik's article. If we look down at the bottom it indicates it was supported by the American Cancer Society.  No mention of the CTR.  Does Dr. Jarvik's article -- you've read the

article?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Does it have some disclosure of anything that we saw in Philip Morris documents yesterday?

A.   No.

Q.   Does anywhere in this book have any disclosure of the documents that you showed the jury yesterday?

A.   No.

Q.   And I want to take a look -- we didn't see Dr. Dunn's article, although when I pulled it up and looked, down at the bottom he has a disclaimer:  "The views expressed herein are those of the author and are in no way to be considered as representing the views of the Council for Tobacco Research or Philip Morris, Inc." And is that Mr. Dunn from Philip Morris?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did Philip Morris -- anything that the jury saw from Philip Morris yesterday get disclosed in this book?

A.   No.

Q.   You were asked early on yesterday whether you're a medical doctor and whether you could diagnose nicotine addiction.  Do you remember that?

A.   I do.

Q.   Do you have to be a medical doctor and have a formal diagnosis in order to assess nicotine dependence

or addiction in somebody?

A.   No.  I've done assessments on, I said, over 10,000 smokers personally through my clinics and through the Quitline and other work that I do.  I have established the assessment protocols that are used by doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and others.

Q.   And when, for example, the Centers For Disease Control declare that most smokers are addicted to nicotine, have they sent out an army of doctors to diagnose all those individuals to reach that conclusion? MR. GERAGHTY:  That's leading and it calls for

hearsay.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

A.   No, they haven't. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And let me ask the same question.  When the Surgeon General says that nicotine addiction kills more people than all other addictions combined, is that based on the Surgeon General sending out a bunch of doctors to diagnose individuals?

A.   No.

Q.   Has the Surgeon General validated the Heaviness of Smoking Index that you use in this case?

A.   Surgeon General has, as well as others.  It's the -- probably the most widely utilized, validated,

reliable measure of measuring strength of dependence or addiction in somebody.

Q.   You were also asked a lot of questions about Christopher Columbus, John Quincy Adams, Mark Twain, a whole history.  Do you recall that?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And in one response you indicated that at some point, of course, people who smoke realize smoking can be hard to quit?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And that was true for Lamar Danielson, of course, correct?

A.   Yes, it was.

Q.   But you said they don't know why it is so hard to quit.  Do you recall that response?

A.   That's right.

Q.   You just told the jury you've treated 10,000 or more people for nicotine addiction.  In your experience, do most smokers know how the cigarettes that they smoke were engineered?

A.   No, they had no clue.

Q.   Do they, in your experience, know how nicotine deliveries have been optimized in the way we talked about yesterday?

A.   No, they don't have any idea.  Most scientists,

frankly, don't even know.  Most medical doctors don't know.  And it's one of the things that I try to educate people about.

Q.   And do most of them who come into your clinic blame themselves instead?

A.   Yes.  Most people blame themselves.  They view it as a character flaw that they can't stop.  They really don't understand and don't fully appreciate nicotine addiction, how it's established, and how difficult it will be for them to overcome it.

Q.   You've looked at all the evidence in this case, not only the industry conduct, but all the depositions. Is there any possibility that Lamar Danielson, during his lifetime, knew the secret industry evidence that you shared with the jury yesterday?

A.   No.  Based on my experience and review of the material in this case, there's no way that he would have understood what was inside and known within the companies about the risks of the product, about how they engineer their product, and, you know, keeps people hooked.  That was not known to the average consumer.

Q.   Now, Mr. Geraghty also asked you a question yesterday were you aware -- and I wrote this down -- of a Gallup poll in June of '54 that asked if 90 percent of people polled had heard of recent studies that cigarette

smoking causes lung cancer.  Do you recall that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Is the actual question that was asked in the poll, Dr. Cummings, had you heard or read anything recently to the effect that smoking may be a cause of cancer of the lung?

A.   That is the actual question.

Q.   And that was in June of '54.  Can you remind the jury when the big White Paper that the lawyer from American Tobacco wrote came out?

A.   April of 1954.  So just a few months before it was widely distributed.

Q. And was that the -- we're talking about the White Paper, the 205,000 copies, 194 radio stations, that White Paper?

A.   That's the one.

Q.   Did it discuss whether smoking may be a cause of cancer?

A.   Yes, it did.

Q.   And what did it conclude?

A.   The evidence was inconclusive.  We don't know what causes cancer.  It was the beginning of the controversy that went on then for 45 years.  In fact, never during the time of the TIRC or CTR did they ever acknowledge that cigarette smoking caused any human

MR. SCHULTZ:  And if we could pull up the ELMO,

please, Ryan.  It may take me a second to zero in on

this. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   You were shown the LIFE magazine article with Dr. Wynder and Graham where they had the smoking machine and all of that?

A.   That's right.

Q.   I wanted to focus, if we can get it in, on the very last thing mentioned in the article.

And it says, "The American Tobacco Company hastened to point out that tests on mice do not prove that tobacco can cause lung cancer in men.  The figures on human death showed that heavy smokers are likelier to get lung cancer later in life than nonsmokers.  Wynder says up to 20 times likelier.  They do not necessarily mean everyone should promptly stop smoking, for this might create nervous ailments in smokers who would feel they had a comforting relaxation.  The research does not indicate that the factor harmful to mice must be isolated" -- "does indicate that it must be isolated, and to this end, several medical teams, some aided by tobacco company money, are now working."

Did the tobacco industry have the last word in

that LIFE magazine article?

A.   Yes, they did.

Q.   And is this a common occurrence in looking over the -- the public information about smoking and health over time, the sort of message that they would get in, the last word, so to speak?

A.   Yes, they always -- whenever anything came out against cigarettes you would usually have a comment from the -- from the tobacco companies either through TIRC, the companies themselves, or the Tobacco Institute, most likely.

Q.   And would that be an example, Dr. Cummings, of giving a self-rationale or a rationalization for an addicted smoker to grab onto to keep smoking?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You were asked questions, Mr. Geraghty showed you some public service announcements, he talked about the early warnings and the warnings in the '70s.  Do you recall that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You showed the jury this quote that's at LP0777, Page 14:  "Out of the Federal Trade Commission's 1981 report, that while most Americans are generally aware that smoking is hazardous, some consumers, especially smokers, do not know this basic fact;

however, even if it is assumed that every consumer is aware that smoking is hazardous, the evidence indicates that many consumers do not have enough information about the health risks of smoking in order to know how dangerous smoking is, i.e., what is the nature and extent of the health risks of smoking?  Many consumers also do not know whether the general health risks of smoking have any personal relevance to themselves.  And many consumers do not know enough about the health effects of smoking to know how dangerous smoking is."

That was the Federal Trade Commission in 1981?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And was that after the warning in '66?

A.   Yes.

Q.   After the warning in 1970?

A.   Correct.

Q.   After many of the PSAs that had come out in the '60s and '70s, for example, the Bill Talman and Perry Mason PSA that we saw?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And just as a reminder, did Philip Morris confirm internally that the statements about consumer knowledge contained in that Federal Trade Commission report are accurately reported and based on sound research techniques, et cetera?

A.   Yes.  They concluded that the findings of the FTC report were accurate.

Q.   And when we tie that into Lamar Danielson, is there any evidence in this case that anyone ever talked to Lamar Danielson about the health effects of smoking before around the year 1980?

A.   No.  There's no evidence.

Q.   And is the 1985 warning the first one we at least have any evidence of Lamar Danielson ever talking about?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would object.

That's calling for speculation on the part of this

witness.

THE COURT:  Overruled.  He's testifying, as I

understand it, on the basis of what he's reviewed.

To that extent, it goes to the weight, not the

admissibility.

A.   Yes.  And in terms of the material I reviewed, the only evidence that I saw was where he commented on the different warnings, and that would have to be after 1985. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Because that's the first time the different warnings were on the packs?

A.   Exactly.

Q.   And is that around the time he started trying to quit smoking, best we know?

A.   Yes.

Q.   As a young man still in his early 30s?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Now, there was some insurance documents filled out by Lamar Danielson that you were shown, correct?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And one was from March of '83 that said he had been smoking for 12 years?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And if we go back to March of 1971, would Mr. Danielson have been 17 years old?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And one said -- was September 6th of '84 and said he had been smoking 13 years.  Do you recall that?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And if we go back 13 years from the date of that application, would that make him 17 years old?

A.   Correct.

Q.   On the same date he also reported 15 years; and 15 years before the date of that application, he would have been 15 years old, correct?

A.   That's right.

smoking for 16 years, and if we go back 16 years from that application, would that have made him 16 years old when he started?

A.   That's right.

Q. Mr. Geraghty asked you a question about Jerry Pate saying that they smoked in high school and at the funeral home.  Do you recall that?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Did Mr. Pate say they only smoked at the funeral home?

A.   No, he did not.

Q.   Did Mr. Pate say that -- that Lamar Danielson was smoking most all the time once they were in high school?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And that he would put one out and light another one up?

A.   Yes.

Q.   There was also a question that Mr. Geraghty asked that Micah Danielson had commented that Lamar had gotten caught smoking by his parents. Do you recall that question?

A.   I do.

Q.   And she also indicated that was when he was 14 years old, correct?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I object.  This is all leading, by the way, and this is calling for hearsay.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Again, this is your witness, so please try not to lead as much. Finish your question. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   How old was Lamar Danielson, according to Lamar Danielson, in that conversation he had with Micah? A.   Micah said he was 14.

Q.   And was there anything in the deposition to suggest what his parents told him or mother told him, whoever caught him, when they caught him smoking? A.   She didn't like it.

Q.   And is there evidence in Ray Danielson's deposition about -- because we heard several times their mother was opposed to smoking.

Is there evidence in his deposition about what she didn't like about smoking?

MR. GERAGHTY: Your Honor, may -- I object. He objected to this question from me yesterday, and you sustained the objection.

THE COURT:  I've permitted a question today going to the -- the general milieu in the household regarding this, and I would overrule this objection

and permit him to answer this question.

A.   Yes.  He talked about, you know, I think ashtrays, she didn't like it.  And then I think he was -- he said it wasn't -- they didn't talk about the health issues related, so that wasn't the issue, it was other things. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Did you say health was never mentioned?

A.   That's what he said.

Q.   You were also asked a few questions about Lamar's beer drinking, and Mr. Geraghty asked you some questions from people as to the amount of beer Mr. Danielson drank.

In particular, he mentioned Charlie Dillard, who was a coworker who I think said Lamar drank 6 to 12 cans of beer every night.

Do you recall that?

A.   I did.

Q.   In Mr. Dillard's deposition was he asked whether he ever spent time at the Danielson household?

A.   Yes, he was.

Q.   And what was his answer?

A.   He never spent time at Lamar's house.

Q.   And did any witness, in the deposition you read, say that Lamar Danielson, that they had ever seen

him intoxicated more than a couple of times in his life?

A.   No, they did not.  In fact, I think his brother, Ray, who was, I believe, a state trooper, commented he didn't really see him drunk at all, that he didn't get intoxicated.

Q.   Very quickly I have just a couple of questions left, Dr. Cummings.

You were asked today about the CTR and the good work the CTR did.  I'd like to put up LP1562.

Is this a publication put out by Philip Morris on the so-called smoking controversy?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And if we look at the last page, there's an indication that it's published in March 1st of 1978. Do you see that?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And if we look over on this page, it -- it asks the question, "Do the tobacco companies control the research they sponsor?  Absolutely not.  The commitment of the tobacco manufacturers to resolve the smoking and health controversy has never been fully appreciated. Grants are made with no strings attached, except a pledge to apply the money to legitimate scientific research.  Each researcher is free to publish his study results, whatever they may be."

And is that consistent with the position Philip Morris and the rest of the industry took publicly throughout Mr. Danielson's lifetime?

A.   Yes.  That's what they said publicly.

Q.   Can you tell the jury who Sheldon Sommers is? We've heard his name a couple of times --

A.   Sure.  He was the --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is beyond the

scope of my cross-exam.

THE COURT:  I overrule the objection.

A.   He was the scientific director for the -- or the president, I believe, at one time of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   And served on the Scientific Advisory Board?

A.   Before that he had served on the advisory board, yes.

Q.   And he's writing to Dr. William Gardner who's the scientific director at this time, which by the way, is November 3rd of 1978, so this would be just a few months after what we just saw from Philip Morris?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And he indicates, "I've been thinking about the recent activities of council -- CTR over the past ten days.  If any trust law cannot be explained to me, then

I cannot understand it.  A typical catch-22 situation in regard to the Fuhrer expert -- Fuchs application, there is no possible relevance to antitrust law.  I can see, hence, advice of counsel as out of bounds and simply adds another level of authority on relevance.  I think CTR should be renamed Counsel for Legally Permitted Tobacco Research, CLIFT, for short."

A.   Right.

Q.   And that was from a member of the SAB?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And I'll show you one other document on the CTR.

A.   Copied to Addison Yeaman from Brown & Williamson.

Q.   And the same Mr. Yeaman that we saw back in '63 saying, "We're in the business of selling an addictive drug"?

A.   Right, chief general counsel of Brown & Williamson.

Q.   Are you familiar with this document, "The Meeting of the Scientific Advisory Board," from April 26th, 1978?

A.   Yes.

Q.   So this would be about six weeks after the Philip Morris publication we just saw saying no strings

attached?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And is -- does -- is this a meeting of SAB members for the CTR including Drs. Feldman and Wyatt?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And if we look over we see that Edwin Jacob is general counsel for CTR at this time, correct?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And Dr. Feldman, whose name we just saw in these minutes, indicated, "The SAB is no longer a free body.  There is no reason for it to exist until after a legal advisory board reviews all grant applications."

Is that how it really worked inside the industry?

A.   Yes.  The SAB, decisions were all vetted by the committee, the law committee.  And the law committee went out and selected its own projects under special projects that were funded under CTR.  They weren't done independent of the cigarette companies.

Q.   You were also asked about Dr. Abood's work by Mr. Geraghty this morning?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And just to remind the jury, was this a document where they talked about the nicotine receptor program -- the one we showed the jury -- and then said

we need to keep the drug nicotine, not be visible about it, the clandestine effort?

A.   That's right.

Q.   You offered an explanation of how Dr. Abood's work related to Philip Morris.  Would you like to offer that explanation now?

A.   Well, sure.  I mean, those documents that we talked about were internal to Philip Morris as to whether CTR ought to continue to fund his research. Then they cut off his funding.

Q.   You were also shown the Pensacola News Journal cover from the 1964 announcement of the report, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And you've told the jury, Dr. Cummings, over the last couple of days you spent a lot of time studying health communications.  That's actually part of your education, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you've published in that area?

A.   Yes, I have.

Q.   Including how consumers perceive messages?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And what effect that has on a generalized basis?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Well, let me ask you if, in your opinion, in 1964 --

A.   Yeah.

Q.   --if this had been the headline of the Pensacola News Journal, what effect would you have expected, based on all the knowledge you just described for us?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, that calls for

speculation.

THE COURT:  I will sustain the objection to

speculation.  Thank you. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Let me ask you this, Dr. Cummings:  Was it around the year '99 or 2000 that the industry stopped denying the health effects and addictiveness of smoking?

A.   Philip Morris was October of 2000.

Q.   And what has happened to smoking rates, and especially youth smoking rates, 15 years out from that?

A.   The smoking rates have declined dramatically since the controversy has dissipated, and we're at dramatically low levels of uptake of smoking by adolescence among the lowest levels we've seen.  I think, in fact, Florida is among the lowest in the country at this point with young people taking up smoking.  And adult smoking prevalence, the last figures

I saw were 15 percent.  In 1964 the prevalence rate was 44 percent.

Q.   Is there any reason to think, Dr. Cummings, based on your knowledge, education, experience, expertise, that what has happened in the last 15 years since the industry stopped denying the message couldn't have happened back in '64 or even '53?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Object to relevance, Your Honor, and it calls for speculation again.

THE COURT:  On the issue of speculation, I believe it does, and I will sustain the objection for that reason.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Your Honor. BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   One other question you were asked at the very beginning of Mr. Geraghty's outline -- or cross-examination:  Had there been 60 million Americans in this country who quit smoking? A.   Right.

Q.   Was Lamar Danielson one of the 60 million? A.   Yes.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you.

Okay.  Make yourself comfortable, and let's go through these, because we've got a number of them. Okay?

First, the sheet has multiple questions on it. The first one:  "Define 'compulsive drug-seeking.'"

Next:  "What percent of smokers develop lung cancer?"

Next:  "A person highly addicted to nicotine runs out of cigarettes.  Would they take any offered cigarette to get a dose of nicotine?"

Next:  "Can you please explain nicotine receptor upregulation in the brain?  And when or how long it takes for it to return to normal once a person quits smoking?"

Next:  "How long does it take for nicotine withdrawal symptoms to stop?"

Okay.  Well, let's treat that one first, and then I'll go one by one.  But, again, I do want to give you an opportunity to speak to your team if you wish to.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Is this the only questions we have?

THE COURT:  No.  You've got much more.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Oh.

so -- but I --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay.  I think I'm getting on board with Your Honor.  I don't like questions either personally because it adds to the length.

THE COURT:  Not just the length.  I frankly don't mind the length so much as it rests a little bit of control out of the lawyer's hands.  But it --well, for the reasons I stated yesterday or the day before.

In any event, "Define 'compulsive drug seeking'."

MR. SCHULTZ: That was asked of Dr. Hurt. He does use the NIDA definition. I think it would be fair for a jury to know what he means by it, or at least his interpretation of it.

THE COURT:  Excellent.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And I don't necessarily disagree.  I guess we'll get deeper down.  I think a lot of these things were addressed with Dr. Hurt that weren't addressed with Dr. Cummings.  And I would, just so Your Honor knows --

MR. SCHULTZ:  We might agree on that.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would say that I think "beyond the scope" should apply here, but I'm fine with Question No. 1.

THE COURT:  Okay.  "What percent of smokers develop lung cancer?"

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think on the causation question, it's irrelevant, because it's stipulated here, but I can understand they thought there wasn't a lot of lung cancer, maybe the companies didn't act as badly or something.  So I think it's of marginal relevance, Judge, but we're not going to oppose --

MR. GERAGHTY:  I was going to agree that's irrelevant, but I thought that's what you were saying.  I would agree not to ask that one.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm fine with not asking it, too, Judge.

THE COURT:  Okay.

Next:  "A person highly addicted to nicotine runs out of cigarettes.  Would they take any offered cigarettes to get a dose of nicotine?"

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think that's highly speculative, because it's cast as a highly addicted individual.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I was going to say I thought that one was okay, because he did talk about addiction a lot.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I don't mind asking it, Judge, if they're in agreement.

THE COURT:  I think I hear defense saying you're okay with it being asked?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yes.

THE COURT:  All right.  It will be asked.

Next:  "Can you please explain nicotine receptor upregulation in the brain and when or how long it takes for it to return to normal once a person quits smoking?"

MR. SCHULTZ:  He is certainly capable of explaining it.  That was not really why we brought him.  Dr. Hurt explained that at length, and I think was even asked a question of downregulation, if I recall.  But, I mean, it's within the province of his knowledge, Judge.  I'm not sure it's within the scope of what he testified about, other than the fact that it relates generally to addiction.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And that would be my objection, too, the -- there was a lengthy discussion about that with Dr. Hurt.  I cross-examined Dr. Hurt about that.  They didn't ask Dr. Cummings about it.  I studiously avoided asking him about those questions. So I think it's beyond the scope of the examination. So I would object.

THE COURT:  What does our beloved Supreme Court say about such things?  I mean, they say let jurors

ask questions.  If we agree that it's within this doctor's expertise -- I don't know what his answer is exactly going to be.  If we say it's within his expertise -- but, you know, we didn't ask it.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.

THE COURT: You know, but isn't that the very point of juror questions is that you didn't ask it, but if the witness is capable of giving a response, the Supreme Court wants the jury to be involved, to feel like they've got a place in this fact-finding, truth-seeking mission.

You know, again, we come back to my personal distaste for the whole concept of -- of this, but --

MR. SCHULTZ:  And I think, Judge, that would be more compelling had we not put on any witness to already discuss this, which we did and was asked a question about it.  All of that is evidence.

If they want to ask the question and you want to have Dr. Cummings answer it, he can.  But I agree it's not within the scope of what we called him in to talk about.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And I object because we'll have an opportunity to answer the juror's question when we get to closing arguments and we remind her of what Dr. Hurt said.  And I think the plaintiff's

counsel made a strategic decision they were going to have Dr. Hurt address certain issues and Dr. Cummings address others.  And I realize the juror may have some curiosity, but we'll satisfy that curiosity on Monday.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Again, unless -- my position is unless I feel that the person either has already given that answer or is not competent to answer the question, it would be my intention to give it, because the juror has asked this question of this witness and would like to hear from this witness. May have heard from another witness but wants to hear it from this witness.  And they've said, "I want to ask this witness this question," and I can't think of a good reason to tell them no, unless that was no, that -- you know, we all determined that that's outside of this witness's expertise, and they're not competent to give an opinion on that issue.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, I think the exception that would apply here is that both sides agree it's beyond the scope of what this witness came here to address, and the juror shouldn't be allowed to broaden the scope of the witness's testimony, whether or not they have an interest in the answer

to the question.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Over the objection of counsel, I'll give it.

"How long does it take for nicotine withdrawal symptoms to stop?"

MR. SCHULTZ:  Dr. Cummings answered that this morning on a question by Mr. Geraghty.  Hearing you, Judge, having just said if the witness has already answered it, you wouldn't be inclined to give it, I would apply that rule.  But all that being said, if they didn't get it, he's competent to give the answer.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I think the issue here, Your Honor, is that many of these questions were written over the course of Monday and yesterday and today.  So whether that juror really has those particular questions still, I don't know; but --

THE COURT:  And let me explain it because you -- you're not seeing what I'm seeing.

He asks several questions, and he struck through some.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay.  All right.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So he's left that one.  He specifically did not strike through that one.  I think you're absolutely right, that there were --

and I say "he," I don't know if it's a he or she --that this juror was writing down questions.  And then as the juror got responses, marked that through.  And if they somehow missed that answer --I mean, you asked the question.  I think you want to --

MR. GERAGHTY:  I asked that question right after the -- right after we started this morning.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  So you asked it.  They apparently missed it, so I -- I don't think there's a harm --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay.

THE COURT:  -- in answering the question.  And so I would ask that one as well.  Okay.

Next.

MR. GERAGHTY:  This is another juror?

THE COURT:  Another juror.  Okay.

I relate to this juror.

THE COURT:  And I'm reading it just as it's written.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Understood, Judge.  I would put that under what percent develop lung cancer category, and I don't think it's relevant to any of the issues.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't � I agree.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That will not, then, be given.

Next:  "Since Dr. Hurt told us that smoking can have a genetic component, does lung cancer have a genetic component, especially with a diagnostic -- a diagnostic C41?"

MR. GERAGHTY:  My guess is that's one of our nurses.

THE COURT:  It may be diagnosis, C4112, but you're welcome to look at it.

"Does lung cancer have a genetic component, especially with diagnosis" -- the letter "C" and the numbers "412."

witness's expertise?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I don't know, honestly.  I'm sure he's read the literature on it, Judge.  It is irrelevant in a case, I believe, where the parties have stipulated that this lung cancer was caused by smoking Marlboro cigarettes.

Now, it does show it's concurring causes --

MR. GERAGHTY:  If Mr. Schultz doesn't want it asked, I will agree.  I don't think it should be asked.

THE COURT:  Okay.  We will not ask that one.

Another juror:  "James Bowling claimed cigarettes were safe, which is why he smoked, and in good conscience permitted his wife and children to smoke.

"Did Mr. Bowling or any members of his family die of a smoking-related illness?"

MR. SCHULTZ: He died of throat cancer. I don't know if it was from smoking or some other reason, but it's clearly irrelevant.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I agree.

said that, but I knew it was not relevant.

Okay.  Here, we've got one juror, six questions:  No. 1:  "When did the "conspiracy" first come to light?

"Were the responsible parties prosecuted?"

MR. SCHULTZ: Urn, you know, Judge, the first question, I think, is fine. The, um -- were they prosecuted? I -- I'm concerned of what is concerning the juror, but -- that they've already been punished, but I don't think you can possibly allow Dr. Cummings to answer that question.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't think he could be allowed to answer either of those questions.  I don't think Dr. Cummings should be permitted to talk.

We have a finding that there was an agreement to conceal, and Dr. Cummings can't tell the jury what that finding means in any way, shape, or form. I'm also concerned -- I don't know if this was the same juror that asked the question of the very -- of the very first witness, but I'm concerned that this juror's hat is in a different place about what this case is about.

THE COURT:  The only thing, then, I can say about the first question -- and I -- and I agree

that the second question is inappropriate.  It's something that they should not consider in any way whatsoever in deliberating the issues in this case.

The first question of when did these, quote, conspiracy, closed quote, first come to light?  I presume the reason they put it in quotes is the --because the alleged conspiracy that plaintiff is pursuing here today, and they haven't heard anything about findings of the Engle court.

But, in fact, the -- you know, the jury in the Engle trial and the Supreme Court in the Engle findings, arguably one could claim that that answers the question.  But I would understand that if you didn't want to give either one of those -- if you didn't want either one of those questions asked, I mean, I can understand why you would not agree.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm fine with asking it, Judge. I hear Mr. Geraghty's not.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm objecting.

THE COURT:  Okay.  To both?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And you're objecting to the first?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Second.

Okay.

Over the objection of Defense, I will give the first.  I will not give the second question. Paragraph -- or question 2:

You stated the TI, parentheses, Tobacco Institute, closed parentheses, had an office in Washington, D.C.  How heavy were their lobbying efforts and were they successful?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, Your Honor, I'll speak first, I guess.

This was the issue that I came sidebar several times about, and I told the Court my concern was that this was exactly what at least some of the jurors would be thinking, based upon the questions and the answers, and the question confirms my concern.

I -- I'm going to renew my motion for mistrial I'm going to say those questions should not be asked.  And I think we have a problem with that particular juror, because they clearly -- that juror has clearly gotten the message that Your Honor also agreed was not what should be taken from the evidence that was presented.

But that's the message they have and that's what they're curious to know about, how powerful

were our lobbyists.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, Judge.

MR. GERAGHTY:  How much money did --

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think Mr. Geraghty has forgotten that Bob Heimann testified by video without objection, other than the general objections that he's not for Philip Morris or what have you, that the TI was founded as the lobbying and public relations arm of the industry.

So there's perfectly admissible not objected-to evidence that suggests exactly what their purpose was .

So I don't read anything into the question. The question itself can't be asked for the reasons the Court wouldn't allow me to ask the questions.

THE COURT:  Right.  I will not ask the question.  I will deny the request for a mistrial.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I know you will have to put these questions in the court file.

THE COURT:  Right.  Uh-huh.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Do we know which juror this is?

THE COURT:  No name on this one.

No. 3:  Nicotine levels vary naturally in the tobacco plant.  Did Philip Morris purposefully design/utilize a process to keep nicotine levels

steady, and did it contribute to keep people addicted?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think he's touched on all that. He's competent to -- to answer it and it's well within the relevance and the scope of the conspiracy and concealment and goes to the addiction question and the comparative fault question.

THE COURT:  I know that it's what this trial is about, but I thought we had two-and-a-half days of testimony on it.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, Your Honor, my concern is this is going to -- I mean, I'm going to have to --if he's allowed to answer that question I'm going to have to cross him for an hour, which I don't want to do.

THE COURT:  I �

MR. GERAGHTY:  I mean �

THE COURT:  Respectfully, I know that we don't want to spend extra time.  This, again, gets us back to that whole delight that I have in juror questions.

But my thought would have been that question --again, my thought certainly would be he's covered some of it -- most of it, actually.  And I presume that I could ask the witness to restrict his answer

to just any areas of that question he has not previously addressed.

MR. SCHULTZ: Judge, in fairness I'm not going to object if you don't read it, but I do think it's an appropriate questions.

THE COURT:  It's a very appropriate question. I mean, it's what the case is about.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.

THE COURT:  The problem, I mean, yes, I understand the problem.  It's sort of, you know --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Big question.

THE COURT:  It's a big question and then it invites a great deal more inquiry of -- but it's not an inappropriate question.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And I hear what Your Honor is saying.  I will -- I object.

I don't think it should be asked.  I -- again, approached sidebar and we had a long sidebar about what Dr. Cummings would and would not be permitted to say based upon Your Honor's rulings.

You overruled that objection at least in part. Dr. Cummings said what he said.

And I was very narrow and surgical in what I addressed with him on cross and Mr. Schultz didn't touch it on redirect.

I just think we're, again, that this is sort of beyond the scope of what we're doing here.  And it's -- I'd have to get materials here to cross --we'd have to have a whole bunch of documents.

And I objected to the same question -- a similar question that Mr. Schultz asked without reference to a particular document, and then he --you instructed him to ask a very limited question about whether they did research.  Dr. Cummings answered that question, and then I didn't follow up on that question.  And so I really think there should be a scope objection that's sustained here. And I don't hear Mr. Schultz disagreeing -- or Mr. Schultz is not disagreeing.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I haven't talked -- response to what you just said.

THE COURT:  Guys, just -- finish what you're saying, Mr. Geraghty.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I object to the question.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Mr. Schultz, anything further?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Only to point out the testimony, the question he's talking about from yesterday, the speed of delivery to the brain.  I predict, Judge, we'll get what we just heard about on recon and that

it does contribute to addiction.  But we'll know, I guess, when the question is asked.

THE COURT:  I will give the question.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor --

THE COURT:  No. 4.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, Your Honor excluded that under Daubert in O'Hara, and we agreed to adhere to that rule here.

THE COURT:  With regard to the Daubert hearing that I held, I held a Daubert hearing with Dr. Hurt, and I based my decision in that on the evidence that was presented to me --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Right.

THE COURT:  -- in that hearing.

And I did not have a chance to have a Daubert hearing on Cummings, nor the -- did I hear all the evidence in the world on Dr. Hurt.  I just heard what I was presented with, you know, that's the limitation we judges have when there's a Daubert hearing.  We just get the evidence that the lawyers decide to present to us.

MR. GERAGHTY:  We didn't ask Your Honor to go through a whole other Daubert hearing here --

THE COURT:  I know.

MR. GERAGHTY:  -- because we didn't want to put

everybody through time, and that we agreed to adhere to the ruling from O'Hara.  And that ruling wasn't that Dr. Hurt was unqualified; it was that there was not, you know, evidence to support that that theory was supported by sound science.

THE COURT:  There was not evidence before me.

MR. GERAGHTY:  That would apply to any witness, including Dr. Cummings.  And now the Daubert ruling is being unraveled to allow him to answer a question simply because a juror is curious --

THE COURT:  A Daubert ruling on Hurt does not control the balance of the case.  In any event, over the objection of defense, No. 3 will be given.

No. 4:  Why did the Tobacco Institute go out of business?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think it's a relevant question, Judge.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't think so, Your Honor. It happened after Mr. Danielson died in 1995.  I don't think it's relevant.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Not tortious.  I mean --

THE COURT:  Thank you, but, again, both of you need to make sure that Mr. Geraghty is finished with his statement before you contribute.  This is not a -- a tit for tat.  This is a you get to talk.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object.  I think it's irrelevant, Your Honor, and will be injecting issues not relevant to the case.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  Anything else in closing, Mr. Schultz?

MR. SCHULTZ:  No, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I will give the question.

No. 5:  Research and evidence has shown smoking is extremely harmful to one's health.  Why are cigarettes still on the market?

I'm going to be telling them that they're legal.  I mean, we've got that instruction.

And I -- it's going to be coming in the final instructions I presume.

MR. SCHULTZ:  We haven't had it yet.  There's one --

THE COURT: I know we haven't had it yet but it's going to be coming in the final instruction. So since I'm giving that in the final instruction --

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes.

ask the question; however, your -- Your Honor had told us you were not going to give the instruction that selling -- marketing, advertising and selling cigarettes is legal and we can't be held liable simply for that.

If Your Honor is going to reconsider and give that instruction, of course we're in favor of Your Honor giving that instruction, but I believe you told us on -- earlier that you weren't going to give that instruction.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I don't recall that.

If I may, Your Honor, it's not in the instructions as they exist approved by Judge Bell. We have an instruction that we agreed to in Brown that we are certainly happy to talk about, and we can handle it all at the charge conference.

MR. GERAGHTY:  And I apologize, Your Honor, let me just rephrase.  It's not that you, this Court did that.  Judge Bell did that.  So I just want to be clear:  I misspoke when I said you, the Court, when it was Judge Bell handling the case told us he would not give that instruction.

(Conferring with Mr. Carpenter.)

MR. SCHULTZ:  We don't have one (conferring with Mr. Carpenter).

MR. GERAGHTY:  If Your Honor is inclined to give that instruction, we would ask that it be given immediately.

THE COURT:  I'm looking through the instructions I gave in O'Hara.  I did not give it in O'Hara, and I don't recall, at this time, the discussion that we had about it.

I -- I gave the defective speech instruction but I don't recall why I did not give that.  I think I might have given it in Gray.

In any event, assuming, since it's not yet in the agreed-upon instructions, the question, then --is -- do I give this question:  Research and evidence has shown smoking is extremely harmful to one's health.  Why are cigarettes still on the market?

Okay.  And is that a question that this -- that should be posed to this witness?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think, Your Honor, regardless of what instruction we -- you ultimately give the jury, and the juror obviously knows they're legal, it is not within his expertise to explain why they are still legal.  I'm not sure there's an answer to tha t que s ti on.

to be asked.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It will not be given.

No. 6:  Did or do cigarette packs disclose or list the known ingredients such as nicotine, tar, et cetera?  Is it on the box?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think that's a perfectly fair question and probably something we should have thought of -- I should have thought of.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object under preemption grounds.  At least as of 1970, when that warning goes on there under the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, there is no obligation to provide any more information on the warning label as a matter of federal law.

I understand the juror may be curious about that, but, again, I think there are -- the juror is speculating about things that are inappropriate.  We would object.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor �

THE COURT:  Do manufacturers of products ever voluntarily include lists of ingredients on their product labels?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think lots of health foods and supplements and stuff like that.

to a conclusion to think that the only thing that's going to be on a label is -- is what is mandated by federal government.

And I certainly have been willing to give a curative instruction about the notices.  I think that we've talked about that, that there is an instruction in there about, you know, these are the notices that are -- the only notices that are required.

Um, I don't see a problem with this particular question.  Again, it's -- yeah, they either are or they're not.

And if you want to follow up with saying, you know, those are not required by the federal government, you're certainly welcome to do that; but the question itself is a legitimate question.  Okay? That's the end of that juror's questions.

I have another one.  Number 1:  You stated that most people that start smoking become addicted. Could you relate that into a percentage?

MR. SCHULTZ:  That's certainly a fair question within his expertise, Judge.

MR. GERAGHTY:  No objection, Your Honor.

appear, even if a smoker quits. Would you say that irreversible harm has been done, or can the body to what extent break down the harmful carcinogens?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think that's getting into medicine, and they're about to hear from Dr. Burns on those issues today.  I don't know that that's necessarily relevant to whether Dr. Cummings ought to answer it.  He certainly knows latency.  He did address it.  When you start getting into, even if they quit, is it irreversible?  I mean, we're talking about lots of factors for different people, and I'm -- I think he can address it, Judge.  I just don't think he's the best witness to address it, I guess, is what I'm saying.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I object.  I think it's beyond the scope of his expertise.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It will not be asked.

No. 3:  Could nicotine be extracted to reduced or zero levels from tobacco?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Unless it falls under the already-been-asked question, I think it's a fair question and he certainly knows the answer to it.

MR. GERAGHTY: I will say that this was the area that Mr. Schultz approached sidebar. I was going to ask Dr. Cummings about this issue.  I

didn't.  Mr. Schultz didn't really ask about it.  I think it's beyond the scope of both of our examinations.  I would object on that ground.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I do think it opens a Pandora's box on the issue we approached about, Judge.  I agree about that.

THE COURT:  I'm going to ask the question.

No. 4:  Based on all your research on the harmful effects of nicotine, should nicotine be banned?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I don't think it's relevant what he thinks, and the federal government says that it can't; in other words, FDA is not permitted to require Philip Morris to take it to a zero level, so I think it'd be an inappropriate question.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I agree and I object.

THE COURT:  It will not be given.

No. 5:  Why has nicotine, a substance, not been banned yet?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think that, again, goes straight into lobbying efforts because that's the answer, Judge, money.  And, therefore, I think it would be inappropriate to ask, because I'm quite confident that's the answer Dr. Cummings would give.

comments there, but I object.  I agree it's an inappropriate question.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I will not give it.

Where filtered cigarettes advertised as a healthier cigarette -- okay.  And it does use the word "where," but I think it means the word "were.

Where filtered cigarettes advertised as a, quote, healthier, closed-quote, cigarette or way to smoke?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think that's a fair question. They've heard marketing evidence from Dr. Cummings. Even though no one says that Lamar Danielson smoked filtered cigarettes for that reason, he certainly grew up in the 1950s and '60s where filters were touted widely as healthier, so it's relevant and it's within his expertise.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would object, Your Honor. Again, Mr. Schultz didn't go into this.  I didn't go into this.  Mr. Danielson only smoked filtered cigarettes.  He started smoking in the late '60s. There were warning labels on those cigarette packs. There was only a handful of advertising on there.

Again, this opens up a whole other issue here, and I would object.  I think it's beyond the scope of the examination, beyond the scope of the issues

that the plaintiff has actually put into play.

THE COURT:  Help me understand, again --because I'm sure you guys followed it more than I did -- when a jury instruction committee made the recommendation and our Supreme Court says, "Yes, they can ask questions," the questions that they're supposed to be asking or allowed to ask are ones which were not covered by the parties in their examination.

So, I mean, the whole argument that it's beyond the scope of the direct and cross-examination is simply -- is antagonistic to the whole reason, that I understand, why they're supposed to be allowed to ask questions.  That they didn't get a question answered by this witness, which they believe the witness might have an answer to which is of interest to them, and I'm supposed to decide, is it relevant and material to the matters before the Court, not whether it was the lawyers didn't ask it -- because it begins with a proposition that the lawyers didn't ask it.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, I hear what Your Honor's saying, but I would disagree with the Court in two respects:  One, the parties can stipulate that questions not be asked, and we've done that

obviously at this point with a number of questions; number two, the jurors' questions are bound by the same rules of evidence that would govern the questions that the lawyers ask.

So, for example, if Mr. Schultz had stood up in redirect and said, "Did Philip Morris market filtered cigarettes as a healthier alternative to nonfiltered cigarettes?"  I would stand up and I would say, "Objection, Your Honor, that's beyond the scope of the cross-examination."

And I -- you know, I'm presuming, of course, when I say this, but I'm presuming the Court would say, "Well, if that was not a question I asked about, then that objection should be sustained."

I think the same thing is true here.  That's kind of where we are here.  And I think -- I understand Your Honor's point, but we've had a whole bunch of questions where the question wasn't asked but it was within the scope of what he addressed.

You said that are a lot of smokers are addicted, what's the percentage?  Perfectly appropriate question, not asked by any lawyers, but well within the scope of what both sides ask this witness.  That's the point I'm trying to make, and that's the basis for my objection here.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Just briefly, Judge, in the direct, which is part of what they heard and part of what's under consideration, I showed him Santa Claus ads to Dr. Cummings, I showed him, you know, gift ads and Ronald Reagan and so on, all to make the point that the environment -- information environment which Mr. Danielson grew up was starkly different from the world that most of them had ever seen, and this goes -- I could have asked that question during that presentation, and if there had been an objection, you know, I can't say what the Court would have done, but I certainly would consider it was the scope of what I was doing, and I think the question is appropriate.

THE COURT:  Over the objection of defense, I will ask that question.

No. 7:  The sale of cigarettes to minors is prohibited.  Was that always so?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I don't know that Dr. Cummings knows the answer to that question.

THE COURT:  I got a quarter bet he does.  I'm actually not a betting man.

MR. SCHULTZ:  (Inaudible) towards that question before, and he didn't know the answer, Judge, so I don't know.  I mean, I know the answer to it, but

I -- maybe his answer is, "I don't know."  That's another, I guess --

THE COURT:  Well, the whole question is: Whatever his answer would be, is that -- yeah, is that within the area of his expertise and his knowledge and history of smoking and marketing?  And it is, but the question, you know, it's up to you guys to -- I -- you know, I don't know.  I'm trying to -- let me -- let me ponder something for a moment here.

With regard to the prohibition on sales of cigarettes to minors, is that a state or federal --I mean, specifically I have a state statute on it.

MR. SCHULTZ:  It's historically state.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yeah.  In my experience it's typically a matter of state law.

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I have to imagine there's --

MR. GERAGHTY:  I think there may be a federal law at this time.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm sure there is at this point.

THE COURT:  Yeah, I think there is now.  I think historically, I think you're right, Mr. Geraghty, that it was a matter of state.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't even recall the answer.

I think at one point the age was like 16.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And there's a 1942 statute in Florida, and the statute I think before that was 1916 or 1919.  I assume they're interested in Florida, and that's what I mean when I say, "I don't know that Dr. Cummings knows the answer to that question and the various changes to the statute over time and so forth."

THE COURT:  So the sale of cigarettes to minors is prohibited.  Was that always so?

Plaintiff, do you object?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I think I must, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Defense?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I object.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It won't be given.

I mean, I presume that -- you know, my -- my thought on why they're wanting the answer to that question is to go to the mindset of Mr. Danielson when he was smoking, and was he breaking the law when he was smoking, and anyway, I don't know where that plays into anything.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I thought the opposite, like, when they saw the '53 evidence, was what Philip Morris was doing illegal?  So I don't know.

THE COURT:  And so it could be --

MR. GERAGHTY:  That's how I saw it.

THE COURT:  -- either one of those or in-between those two, so we don't know.  We won't ask.

Number -- this is another juror.

No. 1:  Who bears the greatest authority on the research of nicotine addiction? (Whose research has been accepted as the leading authority on this issue if just one single source could be identified?)

MR. SCHULTZ:  It's within his expertise, Judge.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm not sure what the question is really asking.  And, you know, there could be authorities on nicotine addiction, but that doesn't mean that their opinions are admissible, as we've talked about with respect to, you know, learned treatises and things of that nature, so --

THE COURT:  Well, it goes to this witness's opinion on what the primary authority, the -- is, and whether he believes it's the authority from the industry, the authority from the Surgeon General's office, the authority from independent scientific research, you know, who bears the greatest authority on the research of nicotine addiction?  Who has been accepted as the leading authority on this issue, if one single source could be identified?

So I think he has an opinion on that.  Again, it goes to the weight, I think, and not to the admissibility of his -- the question.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Note our objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It would be given.

No. 2:  At the time Lamar tried to quit smoking, smokers did not have access to smoking cessation aids that are available today.  We heard about the need to combine several of these, quote, crutches, closed-quote, for heavy smokers, so was his quit attempts using gum or patches doomed from the start?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'm starting to fall under your camp on juror questions, Judge.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Calling for speculation, I think.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yeah, I mean, we -- I think he can tease out a response that -- that is responsive to the question, Judge, but the question is so convoluted, I'm not sure it makes sense, frankly.

THE COURT:  Well, let's talk about the first part.  Let's break it down into two parts.  There is a part that calls for an opinion that actually would go -- invade the province of the jury, and that's the second part of it.

The first part of the question is:  At the time Lamar tried to quit smoking, smokers did not have access to smoking cessation aids that are available today.

Well, that's actually not a question, it's a statement.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I thought it was a statement.

THE COURT:  Yeah, you're right.  You're right. So it's not a question.

So you agree this will not be given?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Mr. Geraghty, you agree?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I agree.

THE COURT:  Okay.

Mr. Cummings, you charge only about a third of what a previous expert witness charges.  Why is that?

(Laughter.)

MR. SCHULTZ:  We don't want him to know, Judge. It's a fair question.  I mean, they're trying to weigh credibility.  They're going to hear Dave Burns.  They're going to hear Dr. Dorce.  They're going to hear Hurt.  It enters how they weigh and judge the evidence.  I think it's a fair question. He knows the answer for why he charges what he

charges.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I guess, Your Honor, if he were to constrain himself to answering the question, I would agree, but if he uses it as an opportunity to make some speech then I would think it's inappropriate.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  And I will ask him to � in the case of all of these questions, I'm going to ask him to try to be as direct with his responses as he can.  Okay.

That was the last one and it will be given. Okay?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Judge?

cut things out of my outline because they weren't covered, and I -- you know, frankly, I don't know where we are now.  We're almost at the lunch break. If you're going -- if he's going to answer all these questions, I prefer that we at least break for lunch for me to decide what, if any, of these things I want to go into and how in depth I go into them, because I may be forced to go into great detail in at least two or three of these subjects, I believe. I don't want to do that obviously --

THE COURT:  No.  Let me just answer it this way.  I'm going to ask these questions.  He's going to answer these questions.  Then I'm going to invite Mr. Schultz, "Do you have any follow-up questions that you want to ask?"

And we're just going to see what the time is. And we're going to be breaking around noon.  And I feel comfortable in telling you that I think that Mr. Cummings is going to be back on the stand after lunch.  So -- and you'll have the time during the noon hour to do exactly what you're talking about.

would ask that the agreed instruction on life insurance be given, I guess, after the questions are -- or before that, I mean --

THE COURT:  Okay.  You represented it was agreed yesterday.  You said that that was through your discussions, I believe, with Mr. Carpenter but Mr. Geraghty was not yet aware of that discussion.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Right.  Not agreed that it be given; agreed as to the instruction itself.

THE COURT:  Oh, okay.

MR. SCHULTZ:  May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.  All right.  Let's get our witness back in.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, we have an instruction on the issue you said you were going to give.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I showed it to Mr. Schultz. It's not as pretty and typed up.  I don't think he agrees with it, but I want to tender it to Your Honor.

advertising cigarettes are lawful activities; therefore, I instruct you that Philip Morris cannot be held liable for merely manufacturing, selling, or advertising cigarettes."

MR. CARPENTER: That was given in the Lamonte case by Judge Terrell. That's what the note says, Your Honor.

MR. SCHULTZ:  He gave a different instruction after Lamonte in our case when we argued that this is insufficient.  It's only half the law.  I can dig that up over lunch, if that's the timing of this, and we can argue this instruction.

No. 1, I don't think it's appropriate to give it at this point.  We've had a question -- I don't recall if we're going to even ask the question, I think we're not -- that already presumed that cigarettes are a legal product.  Nobody suggested otherwise.  So I don't know that there's anything to cure at this point beyond speculation as to what a juror was thinking when they asked a question.

So I don't agree that any instruction should be given at this point.  But if one is, I would like to have the opportunity to proffer our own instruction that properly states the complete law.

consider the giving of these instructions at the conclusion of Dr. Cummings's examination.  And, Plaintiff, you need to try to work out with defense whatever instruction on the legality issue of selling 'em -- you -- it should not include references in there to Congress's desire to keep a large portion of the American economy satisfied by maintaining cigarettes.

I think that was -- some of the reasons that I've seen expressed that in -- in some of the case law is that it's such a large segment of the United States economic production that, um, that the banning of cigarettes would be completely disruptive to the economy.

I don't need reasons.  I just need a statement that essentially says just manufacturing and selling cigarettes is not a prohibited activity under federal or Florida law.  I need something that's that simple and -- okay.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I understand, Your Honor.  I'm going to give you the instruction that we think ought to be given.

Let's get Dr. Cummings back in, please.

(The witness retook the stand at 11:43 a.m.)

(The jury entered the courtroom at 11:45 a.m.)

THE COURT DEPUTY:  Jury is in the box.

THE COURT:  Thank you, everyone.

Please be seated.

We've -- you've been prodigious in your question-writing.  We appreciate that.  Thank you for your interest that you've shown through these questions.

I do want to begin by reminding you that --that you should not -- if we don't ask your question or a question that you put down, certainly, you shouldn't take it personally.  But we've had discussions, and with the context of pretrial rulings within the context of the Evidence Code, within the context of the rules of procedure, there's some questions that we just -- are not going to ask.  But, again, if we don't ask that question, please don't feel bad about it.  I'm sorry.

But please know that I've had to make a ruling of some kind of whether it was admissible or not admissible in this particular case, with this

particular witness, at this particular time; and you shouldn't be concerned about what -- why I ruled what I ruled.  Just please accept the fact that, you know, I've had to make such a decision.

Okay.

Dr. Cummings, the jury has posed some questions, and I'm going to ask you each of these questions.  And when I ask you the question, if you -- if you have difficulty understanding it, I'll try to read it again.  I think they're pretty straightforward.

But then direct your responses to the jurors. And then once the -- all of the questions have been asked and all of the questions have been answered by you, then I'm going to give the plaintiff an opportunity to ask any follow-up questions and then the defendant an opportunity to ask any follow-up questions.  And at that time -- okay?

THE WITNESS:  Okay.

THE COURT:  So at this time the first question: "Define 'compulsive drug-seeking.'"

THE WITNESS:  "Compulsive drug-seeking" would be a frequent need to have the drug persistent daily use, multiple times a day.  So somebody who is smoking a pack, two to three packs of cigarettes a

day is a compulsive cigarette smoker, in my opinion.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And one thing I � that I promised the lawyers that I was going to tell you, and it's -- please don't take it personally, but I was just -- because these are juror questions and are very explicit in their questions, I am going to ask that your responses be just as direct to the answer to that question as you feel like you can and still to give a complete answer.  Thank you.

The next question:  "A person highly addicted to nicotine runs out of cigarettes.

"Would they take any offered cigarette to get a dose of nicotine?"

THE WITNESS:  My experience, it varies.  People often are -- will go to a different store to buy a cigarette, to get their brand.  So sometimes they'll bum other people's cigarettes.  Sometimes they will search around and go to a store -- different store if they don't have it, go to a different store.  So I've seen both kinds of responses from smokers over my experience.

THE COURT:  The next question:  "Can you please explain nicotine receptor upregulation in the brain and when or how long it takes for it to return to normal once a person quits smoking."

THE WITNESS:  Sure.  Well, upregulation, really talking about the development or growth of new receptors in the brain.

So we all have nicotine receptors whether we smoke or not in our bodies. When people begin to expose themselves to cigarette smoke and they get the nicotine hitting the brain, they develop a need to have more nicotine that reflects the fact that they are growing new receptors, and that's referred to as upregulation of the receptors.

So the brains of smokers are different than the brains of nonsmokers.  They have more of these receptors.

The second part of that question upregulation and --

THE COURT:  And when or how long it takes for it to return to normal once a person quits smoking.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  That's an excellent question.

The actual evidence on whether the brain goes back to normal, based on my experience is it doesn't go back to normal.  There are certain -- many parts of the brain that are affected, and there are certainly some animal studies that show some downregulation after a person quits within a few

weeks and so on.

But the brains of people who have been off --or who have been -- who were smokers and quit versus a normal brain, you don't go back to normal.  You've permanently altered your brain.  And the earlier in your life that you were exposed to the drug, the more likely you're going to have changes in the wiring of the brain.  Literally you see some rewiring of the brain.

So it doesn't appear your brain goes back completely to normal, which is why addiction is a chronic relapsing disorder.

THE COURT:  "How long does it take for nicotine withdrawal symptoms to stop?"

THE WITNESS:  Varies.  The heavier the smoker is, you tend to have more intense symptoms but usually two to three weeks is when most people report the most severe withdrawal; irritability, nervousness, anxiousness, short-tempered.

I had mentioned earlier today that cravings for a cigarette and weight-gain tend to be things that go on -- those are also related to nicotine withdrawal -- tend to go on a little bit longer. And, in fact, there are many smokers who will report that they still occasionally will crave a cigarette

even years after they've quit.

THE COURT:  "Who bears the greatest authority on the research of nicotine addiction?  (Whose research has been accepted as the leading authority on the issue if just one single source could be identified.)"

THE WITNESS:  I would say the Surgeon General and -- is probably the leading accepted authority. There are other groups like World Health Organization, American Medical Society, American Cancer Society that have all weighed in on the issue of nicotine addiction, for example.

And their conclusions are consistent with that of the Surgeon General of the United States today.

THE COURT:  When did the, quote, conspiracy, closed quote, first come to light?

THE WITNESS:  Really not until the internal business records and the full scope of the internal documents.  So one of the first areas of work that I did with the documents was to ask the question of what did the companies know and when they knew it.

And I actually got a grant from the National Cancer Institute to address that question, and that was -- that grant, I believe, was awarded in 2000, and I published those results a few years later

after we had collected the documents and analyzed them, put them out in the public domain.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is nonresponsive to the question.

THE COURT:  Well, respectfully, I thought he was being responsive.

But, again, I'll ask you:  When did the, quote, conspiracy, closed quote, first come to light?

And �

THE WITNESS: Yeah, I would say the full scope of the conspiracy really didn't come to light until the late 1990s, early 2000.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

"Nicotine levels vary naturally in the tobacco plant.  Did Philip Morris purposefully design slash, utilize a process to keep nicotine levels steady, and did it con- -- contribute to keep people addicted?"

THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Cigarettes -- nicotine levels in a tobacco plant not only vary from one part of the plant to the next, the leaves on the plant will vary in terms of the amount of nicotine, you'll find.

There are different species of tobacco plants. Burley, bright tobacco which is flue-cured, and

Turkish tobacco I think was mentioned yesterday or today.

Those are different blends.  They vary quite a bit in terms of the amount of nicotine, and they're -- you know, the blending of the product is done for nicotine dosing, as well as supplementing that with the reconstituted tobacco, which is another way to control the nicotine delivery.

And, yes, the companies make sure that they have a sufficient amount of nicotine in their product to keep people hooked.

THE COURT:  Why did the Tobacco Institute go out of business?

THE WITNESS:  They were forced out of business by the state attorney generals as part of a lawsuit, as well as CTR.  Both went out of business; closed their doors in 1998.

THE COURT:  Did or do cigarette packs disclose or list the known ingredients, such as nicotine, tar, et cetera?  Is it on the box?

THE WITNESS:  Well, tar and nicotine were published on the -- in the advertising and also on packs of cigarettes.  But the full formulas for the products had been -- are trade secrets.  And so those certainly have been concealed, and those

formulas have changed over time.

So the product itself, Marlboro in 1964, is not the same Marlboro as you get today.  And it's changed over time, and consumers would have no idea how it was varied.

THE COURT:  You stated that most people that start smoking become addicted.  Could you relate that into a percentage?

THE WITNESS:  Sure.  If I said most people --it's about a third of teenagers who experiment with smoking go on to become regular daily smokers.  So experimentation of smoking is a fairly common thing. Less common today, but it was almost universal back -- you know, many decades ago that teenagers might experiment with smoking a cigarette.  And, of course, only about a third of them become regular smokers, because you have to have enough exposure, and most people find it aversive to start with.

And that distinguishes why some start --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I don't think this is responsive at this point.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I would overrule the objection.

Again --

THE  WITNESS:      Sure.

THE COURT:  Did you need me to repeat the question?

THE WITNESS:  No.

THE COURT:  Okay.

THE WITNESS:  I think I gave the answer.  About a third of experimenters will go on to become regular daily smokers.

THE COURT:  Could nicotine be extracted to reduced or zero levels from tobacco?

THE WITNESS:  Yes.  In the extraction process, like making reconstituted tobacco, the nicotine is removed.  There's no nicotine re- -- there.  So it can be removed from the product, as well as you can genetically engineer tobacco.  So you can grow tobacco plants naturally without nicotine or to any nicotine level you want to engineer it to.

THE COURT:  Next question.

Were filtered cigarettes advertised as a, quote, healthier, closed quote, cigarette or way to smoke?

THE WITNESS:  Certainly early on they were. They -- you know, Viceroy introduced one of the first filtered cigarettes.  You know, talked about its 20,000 filter traps to tar and nicotine levels. Kent cigarette, another early filtered cigarette in

the United States, you know, touted -- it actually had a little smoking machine that showed you the amount of tar collected on a -- a little napkin versus a nonfiltered cigarette.

Those were sort of implied claims, and so that's what a lot of people assumed, is that a filter would make the product better.

In fact, in my research of --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, this is now beyond had scope of the question.

THE COURT:  Okay.  The question was simply: Were they advertised as the healthier cigarette or way to smoke?

And I think you've answered that.

THE WITNESS:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.

I believe the last question that I have is: Dr. Cummings, you charge only about one-third of what a person -- well, of what a previous expert witness charges.  Why is that?

THE WITNESS:  The charges that I have done for this is consistent with what my normal consulting fee would be to government agencies or other groups.

I've tried to be consistent in the amount that I charge.  I mentioned that there is a $4,000 fee

that I charge when I get listed in a case.  That money, as I mentioned, doesn't come to me.  It goes to a community tobacco control fund that I set up at the Medical University of South Carolina that provides money to buy medications to the smokers that are part of the program that I set up at MUSC who don't have, you know, insurance to cover those medications.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I believe those are the only questions I have.

It is now the noon hour, and so we're going to be taking our recess at this time.  And we'll return to then give the attorneys the chance to ask follow-up questions, if any they have, to Dr. Cummings at that time.

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.  Please step out for your lunch recess.

(The jury left the courtroom at 11:59 a.m.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  So -- thank you.

When he gets your cart back, you're free to step out and begin your lunch break.

We're going to sit down and chat a minute about what we need to do before we start back.  Please have a seat.

So then, obviously, if there are any new matters that are brought out on your questions, Mr. Schultz would have the opportunity, just like in redirect, to cover any new matters that you cover. Okay?

What else do we need to do?  What else do we need to talk about?

MR. SCHULTZ:  For the moment nothing from the plaintiff, Your Honor.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Nothing from Philip Morris.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And you're going to figure something out about this instruction on -- that would answer the question that's in apparently one juror's mind, I don't know if it's in all of their minds, but at least in one juror's mind -- about is it illegal to sell cigarettes or why isn't it

illegal or something like that.

Just like -- like, that's not an issue in this case that they're going to be asked to consider kind of thing.  And the defense has presented a proposed special instruction, and you're welcome to work with him on that and come back with something.

Let's talk about the -- when we're going to have our -- when we're going to start having our charge conference.

When does plaintiff anticipate that it's going to be a prime time to commence our charge conference?

MR. SCHULTZ:  Well, I said we'd be done by lunch tomorrow.  And you told me don't be too quick, and, well, I was too quick.

But I do think, Judge, depending on Dr. Burns' cross-examination, because his direct will be very short, I think tomorrow afternoon we will -- if we don't end before 5, I don't think we're going later than 5, and that would be the perfect time.

I'm going to try and sit down and look at that tonight -- I intend to sit down and look at that tonight because I think tomorrow is the best day, whether it's because we break early or whether we're at 6 doing it or what have you.

MR. CARPENTER:  Your Honor, that's fine.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, let me simply say this:  Given how it's gone and given the fact that I don't know how Burns' testimony is going to be received, if there are going to be a lot of objections or not a lot of objections, and given how unfortunately great your deficit is in estimating time -- and, again, it's not personal; it just is, okay, it's just a -- I think that we're going to have to do some serious determination about the witness the defense was talking about because they had this whole question of Friday or Monday.

At the time I felt like, well, from what they're telling me, there's -- we can get her on Friday, and now I have doubts about that.  And so you-all keep talking, but, you know, I don't know when we're going to get Cummings off the stand this afternoon, if we're going to get him off the stand this afternoon.

And I don't know when we're going to start with your fact witnesses, and I anticipate that the plaintiff is going to be on the stand a long time.

And so for all those reasons, you know, this --I'm thinking we may take a big chunk of this afternoon, if not all this afternoon, with

Dr. Cummings.

And then if we get into fact witnesses, then you're going to go into Friday morning with fact witnesses with the cross-examination that I anticipate is going to happen with those fact witnesses, and so that's my concern.

That's where I am.  I just -- it just is.  But I'm not going to try to estimate it.  You guys are going to have to make some decisions, agreements.

We've got Friday available.  We've got Monday available.  If, in fact, we don't get concluded with the evidence, and I don't see now how we're going to do that on Friday because you're going to have some rebuttal evidence, I'm thinking that what we may very well do is we may have our charge conference on Monday morning and just simply have the jury come in a little bit later on Monday to finish it.  That's a thought that I'm having.

And that would give you-all the opportunity to visit over the weekend and not during the middle of while you're preparing for other witnesses to try to get your -- you know, your -- your distinctions, your differences on the instructions resolved.  That might be the best way to try to handle it.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, the only thing I

would say is if Dr. Dorce gets pushed to Monday, I think that would be great.  I don't know that that's going to happen.

I think we'11 have a very good idea by the end of today, or certainly by the time Dr. Burns is off because we've got Mr. Pate who has to go on today. He's going out of town.  Probably a 15-minute direct.  I don't know how long the cross will be.

And then we have four family members. Mrs. Danielson from our end won't be that long; the cross may be.  But I'm not concerned about it.

We're still on track, in fact, of where we thought we would be, but I can certainly see the possibility we'll go into Friday morning.

Dr. Dorce's direct, I believe, based on experience, would be a couple of hours.  Cross would probably a couple of hours.  So I'm -- I'm not sure we're going to get done with all of this by Friday as it is.  I'm just speculating as well.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm just saying that my confidence level is low, and -- but you guys, you know much more than I, you know.  You know what they're going to say and what you anticipate you're going to need to cross.

And Mr. Geraghty?

MR. GERAGHTY:  I don't want to try to make promises to you because so far I've been very bad at trying to keep to those timelines.

THE COURT:  You're not the only lawyer in the room that has been.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I will say, and I don't want to argue this, but I'm going to do my best to move Dr. Cummings along obviously.  I have to ask him some questions.

THE COURT:  Sure.  I mean, you've got to ask him questions, and I know that.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I understand.  What I do think -- and I'm just pulling these out.  I was given the slides for Dr. Burns.  And I know, Your Honor, as soon as we're done with Dr. Cummings you will want to move on to Dr. Burns.  I'm just going to show you some slides that I think, frankly, are cumulative at this point.

Dr. Burns should be very limited, because we've had Dr. Hurt and Dr. Cummings testify.  So I'm just going to hand them up, and we don't need to discuss them now.  And I'll let Your Honor look at them, and if you want to talk --

THEREUPON, the following proceedings were had and taken at 1:02 p.m.:

AFTERNOON SESSION

(The witness retook the stand at 12:58 p.m., outside of the presence of the Court.)

THE COURT DEPUTY:  Remain seated.  Circuit Court is reconvened.

THE COURT:  Let's go ahead and bring the jury in.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, we will talk about the instruction before --

THE COURT:  I'm sorry.  Thank you so much.  We need to address that instruction.

Do you have one?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I do, Your Honor, but if I might, I'd like to be heard on this.  I think it's an important issue and I've had about 25 minutes to really look into it.  Hand it up, sir.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Okay.

MR. SCHULTZ:  We appreciate it, Judge.  The concern that arose, as I appreciated it, anyway, was from a juror question that essentially said, "If cigarettes are harmful, why are they legal?"

The jury, it's plaintiff's position, should be told now that's not an issue for their

consideration.  It's not an issue we suggested in voir dire, in opening statement, or in the evidence. It's not an issue in the case at all whether cigarettes are a legal product.

The �

THE COURT:  I'm sorry.  My -- my bad.  Okay. We're not ready yet.

THE COURT DEPUTY:  Okay.

MR. SCHULTZ: It's not an issue at all, Judge, whether cigarettes are a legal product. That's not contested.

The instruction that the defendant has proposed I think in most circumstances would be appropriate. We object giving an instruction halfway through the trial on anything about what does or doesn't establish liability, especially when it's not given in the context of all the other instructions on liability and particularly when it's not going to be given to the jury in a set of instructions of where they can put it into the proper context.  And that's particularly so when in our estimation, at least, the entire instruction hangs on the word "merely."

I'm afraid -- and we can hear from some of these jury questions, the issues can be confusing and overwhelming, and I'm afraid there is a very

real risk a juror may hear that as, look, they can't be held liable for selling, manufacturing, or advertising.  What are we doing here?  And they're going to have that thought in their mind until the end of the trial, and then they get the rest of the instructions on liability.

Philip Morris -- in this case, if there's a finding on Question 1, Your Honor, on addiction and class membership, then Philip Morris's manufacturing and sale of the cigarettes that killed Lamar Danielson is unlawful.

And so it's not appropriate to tell them simply that the mere act of selling them is not -- is not a basis for liability, particularly when they haven't heard all the other evidence or the instructions in the case.

They're not going to be asked to decide that issue, and plaintiff contends that's the instruction they ought be given.  And I've offered up what I whipped up in five minutes on a lunch break trying to research this and go through the old instructions that say, "Cigarettes are a legal product.  Whether cigarettes should be legal and why cigarettes are legal is not -- are not issues for you to decide in this case and should not enter into your

considerations in any way."

Plaintiff contends that addresses the issue of concern right now, which is a juror who's saying, "Why are cigarettes legal?"

"Well, Juror, you're not supposed to think about that.  Put it out of your mind going forward. It's not an issue in this case."  Rather than let's talk about what they can and cannot be held liable for in isolation in an easily misapprehended instruction.

I gave up one alternate, Judge, if you were inclined to give something along the lines of what defendant has proposed, which we, for the reasons I just articulated, disagree with, that says, "Cigarettes may be manufactured, sold, and advertised in a lawful manner or in a manner that violates the law."  Plaintiff does not contend that the mere act of manufacturing, selling, or advertising cigarettes is in itself illegal and that is not an issue you will be called upon to decide in this case, which we believe would be a more appropriate instruction under the circumstances if you're inclined to give one at all.

And the last thing I would say on the issue, Your Honor, it's close to the class membership

issue.  They cite preemption as a basis for giving this instruction.  Preemption doesn't protect concealment and fraud.  That's straight out of the Cipollone decision.  You can sell products in an illegal manner.  That's the claim that we make in this case.  And we think it would be misleading to tell the jury that they can't find them liable merely for selling cigarettes halfway through the trial in isolation from all the other issues.

THE COURT:  Response?

MR. CARPENTER:  Your Honor, our instruction is absolutely appropriate and necessary.  It's an absolute correct statement of the law.  There is no liability for the mere manufacture and sale of cigarettes.  Plaintiff has to prove the liability.

If plaintiff is adopting the position that he's entitled to a verdict of damages against my client for the mere sale and advertising and manufacturing cigarettes, that is absolutely counter to the law, federal preemption, as well as Florida law.  He's got to prove it and Douglas makes that clear.

Douglas makes it clear.  We can debate about whether Douglas, as the federal court in Graham has found, is violative of federal preemption principles.  But Douglas makes it clear, you've got

to show they're addictive and disease causing, at least.  Douglas says that's subsumed within the class membership determination.  And whether that violates preemption or not is another question.  But there's no argument that it's an absolute correct statement of the law.  There can be no liability for merely manufacturing, selling, and advertising cigarettes.

No. 2,   there's nothing confusing about that instruction.  It's very simple, two short sentences. The jury knows what "merely" means.  I have every confidence that Mr. Schultz is an able enough lawyer in closing to point out any issues he has with that. It's absolutely not misleading.

No. 3, it's absolutely necessary.  This is the second time we've had a question indicating that there should be some kind of liability or my client should be held responsible for simply selling cigarettes.

Remember when we moved for mistrial based on the first set of juror questions and there was the question to Dr. Hurt that basically asked him to assume he has battled addiction, studied addiction, whether Philip Morris should be at least partially responsible for Lamar Danielson's death since they

distribute products that are deadly and addictive? We went around about that.

Then we got this other question which clearly is along the same lines.  Another question asking, "If cigarettes are harmful, why are they legal?" Plaintiff's proposed instructions don't address the issue.  The problem here that we need to correct is that someone on this jury clearly thinks that cigarettes should be legal, and cigarettes should --my client should be responsible for all the harm caused by cigarettes as a matter of law.

That's the problem.  Neither of these instructions proffered by plaintiff do the job. These are confusing, the ones Mr. -- Mr. Schultz just gave you.  Ours is a clear, concise, proper statement of the law.  We're asking for it.  We think it's needed.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Your Honor, I don't get up and just give a closing after you read this instruction to this jury and put it in any context whatsoever. The juror question that we're here about didn't suggest in any way any liability.  It said, "If cigarettes are harmful, why are they legal?"

The juror should not be told, "Well, let me tell you about the liability in this case, not all

of it, just a little bit.  I'm going to give you that instruction to hang on to and maybe it will get cleared up four or five days from now in closing argument."

The issue can be addressed by telling the juror, "That's not something you have to consider in this case.  Put it out of your mind going forward." That fixes the issue as we perceive the problem to be without getting into issues of liability, without getting into questions of class membership where the conduct elements of the tort are satisfied.  If Lamar Danielson was addicted and died as a result of addiction, then the conduct elements are satisfied under Engle.

The corrective instruction that we have in the former case Brown that I mentioned, and Judge Terrell didn't give it, he refused to give their instruction and our instruction, actually couched it in terms of the Engle findings, because we've put a bell jar over that for this jury that we can't do that.  So the earlier proposed instruction would say, "If you find he's a class member," and then explain it was unlawful as a matter of law the way they were sold and advertised.  But we can't do that here, Judge.

Our position is it's very simple to tell them, "Cigarettes are a legal product, you're not here to answer any other question related to that, let's move on," rather than talking about liability in isolation without any explanation from the plaintiffs halfway through the trial.

MR. CARPENTER:  It's incredible, Your Honor, that Mr. Schultz thinks we shouldn't be talking about liability and instructing the jury on liability.  I don't care if they, frankly, think in a vacuum, if they have an opinion on whether cigarettes should be legal or not.  The problem is, in applying that opinion and holding my client liable, this trial is all about liability.  The liability needs to be in the instruction.  That's why we're here.  That's the only thing we care about.  For Mr. Schultz to say that liability isn't the issue is absurd.

THE COURT: Thank you. We'll take this � I'm not going to give anything now. If I give anything on another of these instructions, it will be in the final instructions.  Thank you.

THE COURT:  If it's on the same issue I've just ruled, I'm not giving any curative instruction at this time.

MR. CARPENTER:  I'm not asking for it again. I'm asking for something else, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  What is it?

MR. CARPENTER:  I'll try to figure it out if you will let me speak.

Is Your Honor able to tell, because this is the second question we've gotten premising liability, responsibility on whether cigarettes should be a legal product.  Is this the same -- Your Honor will be able to tell us.  Is this the same juror who wrote the question asking Dr. Hurt if he thought Philip Morris should be responsible for Lamar Danielson's death?  Did the same juror give the same note?

MR. CARPENTER:  Can I see this one?

THE COURT:  No, sir, not right now.  You cannot.  Thanks.  You may have a seat.

(The jury entered the courtroom at 1:14 p.m.)

THE COURT DEPUTY:  Jury is in the box, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Please be seated, everyone.  Now to bring us back to where we are, you remember that the plaintiff and defendant concluded their direct and cross-examination and redirect of this witness.

Then the jury was permitted to ask questions. You submitted a number of questions.  The Court, along with the assistance of the attorneys, made a determination of which of those questions were appropriate for me to, then, direct on your behalf to the witness.

I did that, and he has provided his responses as to those questions.  We now are at the point where the parties have a right to follow up on the questions that you asked -- that the jury asked and

that he has answered.  And, of course, it will go in the same order as the regular examination of a witness.

The plaintiff's counsel will have a chance to follow up first, and then the defense counsel.  And then if there are any additional questions that are -- that are raised as a result of the questions and answers by defense counsel, then plaintiff's counsel can have a brief redirect on that.

So we'll hear from Mr. Schultz, and then from Mr. Geraghty, and then Mr. Schultz again.

Thank you, Mr. Schultz.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Thank you, Your Honor.

K. MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D., MPH, having been previously duly sworn or affirmed, continued to testify under oath as follows:

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONING BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Just two very short questions, Dr. Cummings. There was a question about what percentage of smokers become addicted, and I think you indicated of people who experiment, about one-third of those become addicted.  Was that right?

A.   Yeah.  I was talking about nonsmokers.

Predominantly teenagers who were experimenting and become -- go on to become regular daily smokers, that's about a third.  If you look at people who are smokers, which the definition of who smokes is if you smoked 100 cigarettes in your lifetime, if you get to 100 cigarettes, generally what we see is about 85 to 90 percent of those individuals are classified as persistent daily users.

And so about 10 to 15 percent would be that social smoker called the "weekend warrior."  You tend to see they're smoking not on a daily basis.  So I start with addiction.  If you're a persistent daily smoker, you're addicted.  That's 85 to 90 percent of people who have reached that 100-cigarette threshold sort of go on through that experimentation phase.

Q.   Okay.  The last bit of your answer actually answered my second question.

FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONING BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   Probably nobody's going to believe me, but I'm going to try to keep this very short and sweet and get you out of here as soon as I can.  I'm not going to follow up on every answer you gave to the jurors' questions, but I just have a couple --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- for you here.

Yesterday we talked about the fact that there are 60 million ex-smokers in the United States, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And one of the questions asked you about the upregulation in the nicotinic receptors.

A.   That's right.

Q.   And you said that you thought those were permanent brain changes, right?

A.   That's my understanding based on my clinical experience, as well as talking to the experts in neuroscience who do the basic studies.  That's my understanding.

Q.   My question simply is that the overwhelming majority of those 60 million ex-smokers would have experienced the same brand changes that you described,

right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You also were asked about -- you were asked a question.  And in response to that question, you talked about tobacco blends.  You talked about additives.  You may or may not have -- I don't recall.  You might have mentioned reconstituted tobacco again.

And my question simply is that the majority of the 60 million ex-smokers in this country would have smoked cigarettes with many of those same features that you described in response to the juror's question, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And the truth is, a very high percentage of the 60 million ex-smokers quit smoking cold turkey, right?

A.   That's true.

Q.   Switching gears here on you now.  You -- well, you were asked about additives.

A.   Correct.

Q.   Would you agree that it has been known and reported in the press that there are additives added to cigarettes for many years?

A.   In a general level, that's true.

Q.   Right.  And in 1985 Philip Morris produced to the -- the government, specifically the Secretary of

Health and Human Services, a list of the additives used in their cigarettes, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And since 1985, on an annual basis Philip Morris has had to disclose that list, right?

A.   To four people in the government.

Q.   Right.  But it's to the Department of Health and Human Services?

A.   That is -- one of the individuals.  The secretary gets it, I think it's the director of the Office on Smoking and Health gets to see the list.  And there are two other people that I don't recall who they were, but it's a very limited distribution.

Q.   All right.  You're not aware that the Secretary of Health and Human Services or anyone who's had that list has ever asked Philip Morris to remove a particular additive from any of its cigarettes for health concerns?

A.   No.  I'm not aware one way or the other.

Q.   Right.  You mentioned in response to -- this may have been actually before -- this may have been during Mr. Schultz's redirect.  I don't remember right now.  But you know that Philip Morris has a Web site, and they've had a Web site since 2000?

objection at this point?  I just don't understand

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'll overrule the objection.

Thank you.

I think I know where he's going.  If he heads

in a different direction, then I'm going to have to

revisit it, but I believe it's consistent with the

question.

MR. SCHULTZ:  Sure.

A.   Yes.  I'm aware of the Web site. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   You've seen the Web site, I'm sure, a number of times?

A.   Sure.

Q.   And you can go to that Philip Morris Web site and see the ingredients for specific brands of Philip Morris cigarettes?

A.   Not in 2000, you couldn't.

Q.   Well, you've been able to do that for at least the last ten years?

A.   Not sure of the last ten years.  It's more recent that you could go.  And, actually, you don't get the full formulas.  They only give you limited amount of information on the particular additives that are used.

ask for Marlboro and the different packings in Marlboro, and there will be a list of additives?

A.   Sure.  That's one of the ways we know today that there's -- for example, diammonium phosphate that's added to the product.

Q.   Okay.  Switching gears here now.  You talked about the extraction of nicotine, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   Philip Morris developed very low or almost no nicotine cigarettes through an extraction process, right?

A. Yeah. Experimentally. There have been -- they have been testing very low and nicotine-free cigarettes, you know, based on my research back to the '60s.

Q.   Well, you know -- I'm talking more specifically about a time period in the 1980s, when Philip Morris developed three brands of cigarettes made with denicotinized cigarettes, right?

A.   I'm familiar with that.  That was a test.

Q.   Well, in the early 1980s -- let's talk about it --

A.   Sure.

Q.   -- Philip Morris purchased General Foods, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And General Foods was the maker of Sanka decaffeinated coffee, right?

A.   True.

Q.   And Philip Morris built a new factory to --well, first of all, let me back up.  They bought General Foods, at least in part because they wanted to have a decaffeinated process, right?

A.   I don't know why they bought General Foods.

Q.   Okay.  Well, let me ask you the next question, then.  Philip Morris built a factory to create and manufacture these denicotinized cigarettes, right?

A.   They did.

Q.   And you know that Philip Morris spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop this denicotinized cigarette, right?

A.   That's what I've been told.

Q.   And they succeeded in creating cigarettes with very, very low levels of nicotine, right?

A.   They have succeeded before that in creating very, very low nicotine cigarettes, but they did with this particular methodology called supercritical extraction.

Q.   I'm trying to get you out of here and move on. So just stay focused on my question.

I'm talking about this denicotinize process

after they bought General Foods.  This was in the 1980s.

And with that process, they succeeded in creating cigarettes with very, very low levels of nicotine, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And Philip Morris introduced these denicotinized cigarettes into test markets here in the United States; did they not?

A.   Three cities.

Q.   Right.  And let's go through that.  One of the cities was Tampa, Florida, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   One of the cities was Hartford, Connecticut?

A.   Correct.

Q.   And one of the cities was Richmond, Virginia?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And the three brands, one was called Next?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Next, denicotinized cigarettes.

And then they launched a denicotinized version of two other brands that were on the market.  They had a Merit DeNic, right?

A.   That's right.  These were line extensions.  So they had a Merit DeNic and Benson & Hedges DeNic.  Those were the three products, each tested in different test

markets.

Q.   And Philip Morris offer price promotions on cigarettes to try to encourage people to buy and smoke those denicotinized cigarettes?

A.   As they do with almost any new product that gets introduced.

Q.   Right.  And after Philip Morris stopped providing the special price promotions, sales dropped off?

A.   As happens with any price promotion, sales drop.

Q.   I'm sorry.  I wasn't actually finished with my question.  Let me just try again.

After Philip Morris stopped running the special price promotions on these denicotinized brands, sales dropped off and smokers stopped buying the cigarettes, right?

A.   Not entirely.  But their sales did drop.  As would be expected when you offer discounts or promotions to purchase, they did get fair amount of trial of the product.  There was a lot of interest in the product. And then their sales fell off when they removed -- or reduced the discounts that they were offering.  And that did happen.  And then they pulled those cigarettes from the market.

Q.   Right.  You anticipated my question.

Philip Morris ultimately did remove the Next product from the market, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   That occurred after they had been very, very vigorously criticized for launching these brands of cigarettes by certain people within the public health community?

A.   Sure.

Q.   You're familiar with Matt Myers from the -- I think it's called the -- Action on Smoking and --Smoking or Health, right?

A.   Actually, he -- Matt is the president of the campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

Q.   Okay.  I misspoke as to what he does. Let me show you -- this is PMU56872. I'm going to try not to spend -- I've only got a Lexus version of the article.

A.   Sure.

Q.   This is an April 8th, 1991, article.

Have you seen the article before?  I think it was -- it was Business News -- here we go.  See that Associated Press?

Says Denic Cigarettes Misleading." Right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   And I've highlighted a passage that says, "An anti-smoking coalition today said de-nicotine cigarettes are being falsely promoted as a nonaddictive alternative to traditional smokes and it called for tighter government regulation of such claims."

A.   That's right.

Q.   And this is the gentleman I mentioned earlier down at the bottom.  I just wanted to bring to your attention what he said specifically.

A.   Sure.

Q.   He -- let me make it a little bit higher.

"Matt Myers, staff director for the coalition, said denicotined cigarettes" -- he said -- "denicotined cigarettes may be 'the most hazardous tobacco product put on the market in the last 10 years.'" Did I read that correctly?

A.   You did.

Q.   And not long after the -- this kind of criticism took place, Philip Morris did, as you say, ultimately remove these cigarettes from the test markets, right?

A.   They -- they removed them fairly quickly.  Even

though they had sales that were accounting for about one or two market share points in the three test markets, that's -- you know, every share is about a half a billion dollars.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I would move to

strike as nonresponsive to my question.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  I will ask you to be a

little more direct with your response, please. BY MR. GERAGHTY:

Q.   My question was, after this criticism was leveled, Philip Morris ultimately removed these three brands, Next, Merit DeNic, Benson & Hedges DeNic, from these test markets, yes or no?

A.   No.  Not in a direct response to the criticism you're trying to draw that link.  Philip Morris never did anything in response to criticism from public health officials, in my estimation.  They did remove it, and I am not really sure why.

Q.   All right.  You know that after Philip Morris removed these denicotinized brands from the market in about 1991 or 1992, they ultimately introduced a brand called Merit Ultima?

A.   Sure.

Q.   Right?

A.   Yeah.

Q.   And Merit Ultima had a little bit higher nicotine than the three brands of denicotinized cigarettes that we talked about, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   But much lower than, say -- for example, than a Marlboro Red?

A.   It was lower than a Marlboro Red, but not much different because of the way the cigarette was engineered.  So when you did biological tests on people smoking the Merit Ultima cigarette versus Marlboro, the nicotine levels would be almost identical because of what we refer to as smoker compensation.

Q.   Let me try my question one more time. Within a couple of years after these denicotinized cigarettes were taken off the market, Philip Morris introduced a cigarette brand called Merit Ultima that had approximately the same level --maybe a little bit more -- of the nicotine as these denicotinized brands we just discussed?

A. Yeah. Based on a standard smoking machine. But that really is irrelevant. What matters is what gets in the smoker.

Q.   All right.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I would move to strike that last

part of that answer as nonresponsive, Your Honor.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I have no further questions.

Thank you, Dr. Cummings. THE WITNESS: Thank you. THE COURT:  Plaintiff?

MR. SCHULTZ:  I have just two or three quick follow-ups.

FURTHER FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONING BY MR. SCHULTZ:

Q.   Dr. Cummings, 1985 disclosure of ingredients would -- were Philip Morris or any other cigarette company's ingredients disclosed to it public or Lamar Danielson during that time?

A.   No, they weren't.  And the list of ingredients, by the way, was never disclosed by brand.  So you wouldn't know what was in a Marlboro or a Camel or any other brand, for that matter.  And it was only disclosed to four people in the government, and they were not allowed to share it with anyone.  It was under lock and key.

Q. And there was a reference to Philip Morris Web site. Did that exist at any point during Lamar Danielson's lifetime?

A.   No.

Q.   Would Lamar Danielson ever have had the opportunity to walk into a store in Pensacola, Florida, and buy one of those three brands of low or no nicotine cigarettes Mr. Geraghty described? A.   No.

Q.   And if I understood you, you said the Ultima cigarette, which had more nicotine than those, had less than a Marlboro; but if you put it in the hands of a smoker, it actually delivered as much to the smoker as Marlboro would?

A.   That is correct.

Q.   That's it.  Thank you very much, Doctor.

THE COURT:  Thank you, sir.  You may step down. (The witness stepped down at 1:30.) THE COURT:  Members of the jury, I need to ask you to step into the jury room for just a moment. We've got some matters of law to talk about before we begin with the next witness.  Thank you.

(The jury left the courtroom at 1:30 p.m.) THE COURT:  Okay.  The jury is out.  Thank you. Please be seated.

to be used by Dr. Burns that you wanted to object to.

And so the plaintiff and defense have had over lunch time to consider that, and I think I was provided a total of four.

Has there been any discussion -- has there been any agreement to either agreed-upon slides or withdraw slides or anything else?

MR. SCHULTZ:  No, Your Honor.  They handed up the four, and you were going to take them under consideration.  We have not discussed it.  I'm not sure what the objections are.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well... then if you guys haven't talked about them, then we'll hear your discussion right now.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  I didn't mean to interrupt you.

THE COURT:  No problem.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Real quickly.  There's two that are cigarette consumption charts.  One says, "Per Capita Cigarette Consumption 20th Century."  One says, "Per Capita Consumption and Lung Cancer Death Rates."

These were slides that were shown with Dr. Cummings.  And we had extensive testimony with Dr. Cummings about per capita cigarette consumption over time.

Dr. Hurt actually talked about it without reference to the -- the demonstratives because of Your Honor's ruling with respect to Dr. Hurt.

So this will be the third witness that comes to talk about per capita cigarette consumption.  I think this is cumulative at this point.

Now, what I think I might hear in response is, well, Dr. Burns is going to talk about lung cancer. So we're going to tie this more specifically to lung cancer.

My main response to that is, they have another slide, that I did not object to, Your Honor, that says, "factual stipulation."  They've put four points on another slide.  I don't object to this.

But Point No. 1 says, "Smoking cigarettes was the medical cause of Norman Lamar Danielson's lung cancer and death."

I don't know if you can read it from there. I'm just holding it up.

THE COURT:  Yeah.  I can't.

stood up in opening statement and told the jury there was going to be no dispute in this case that cigarette smoking was the medical cause of Mr. Danielson's lung cancer.  So I don't think we need to go into some huge dissertation about either per capita cigarette consumption rates or lung cancer, frankly, for that matter.

So that's the basis for the objection to those two points.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And the next two?

MR. GERAGHTY:  The other one says chemicals in cigarette smoke.

That's (indicating) -- you got that one, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. GERAGHTY:  This is just a listing of the types of compounds that get generated when you burn cigarettes.  And there's no dispute that there are carcinogens in smoke.  There's no dispute that those carcinogens ultimately were what caused Mr. Danielson's lung cancer from a medical perspective.

So, again, I think a long dissertation about what's in smoke is irrelevant, given the issues in the case.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And you have cessation interest.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Right.  And, Your Honor, this is simply a -- in a graph form what you heard already Dr. Hurt and Dr. Cummings explain in excruciating detail, about the number of people who say they want to quit, the percentage of those people who then make an effort to quit, the people who are successful at certain points and who are long-term successful.

Both Dr. Hurt and Dr. Cummings both said that only about 3 to 5 percent of people are successful in any given year quitting smoking.  So this is just a graph that says what the other witnesses have already said.  It's cumulative.

And there's a point at which the cumulative nature of the testimony becomes prejudicial, and having a third -- I didn't object with Cummings or Hurt on those grounds, but now with Dr. Burns I am objecting.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Mr. Schultz.

MR. SCHULTZ:  If I'm taking each of them in order, Judge, the per capita graph, we've used that graph throughout all the trials for lots of different reasons.  It's essentially the story of

smoking in the 20th century in America. Dr. Cummings, for example, used it primarily to talk about the cultural rise of smoking.  He uses his benchmarks to talk about historical landmarks, the time of the conspiracy, the Surgeon General's Report, and so forth.

I believe Dr. Burns will be using it to talk about latency particularly.  Dr. Cummings, I think on cross, mentioned something about cancer latency. I think it came up obliquely on a direct when he said there wouldn't have been a lot of cancer during Lamar Danielson's childhood.

It was not something in my outline.  I never said Dr. Cummings, let's talk about cancer latency. Dr. Burns is going to talk about that briefly, because he's going -- and this bleeds rights into the subject, this idea that they shouldn't hear anything about cancer.

Dr. Burns is the medical doctor who's actually giving the diagnosis of nicotine addiction and that addiction caused the death.  Dr. Cummings said --explained how all of that works, and we're not going to see that evidence again from Dr. Burns or any of that.

Dr. Cummings explained the differences between

social smokers and addicted smokers, and he said that but for the addiction, he wouldn't have had exposure to the smoke.  But he -- although he does it in lots of trials, we don't have him come in and say that nicotine addiction caused Mr. Danielson's death.  We prefer to have a medical doctor to do that for reasons that have to do with Florida case law and who can opine on that.  That's what Dr. Burns is going to opine on.

Part of that explanation, Judge, is the lung cancer process.  The jury has to understand it's repeated insults over time.  Cancer doesn't just happen overnight.  And it's the sustained exposure and the addiction that goes along with that cancer process.

I would think, based on what I've seen in previous trials, we might be talking about 10 or 15 minutes of testimony on the most on that lung cancer process, which the jury has heard nothing about.

And it's true that Mr. Geraghty stood up and said they stipulate to medical cause; we asked them to stipulate to legal cause and they said no.  And when he stood up in opening and explained to the jury getting hit by a bus if you've been looking at your phone or you knew the bus was there and then

you'll appreciate the difference between medical cause and legal cause.

It's very clear, as far as Philip Morris is concerned, legal cause of smoking is still very much at play in this trial, and they're going to try to convince the jury that they're different and we haven't proven legal cause.  I think that was very clear in the opening.

That's what Dr. Burns intends to address.  Part of that is a latency graph that will probably be up there for a minute or two while he explains the difference.

That was not used by me with Dr. Cummings, a cancer latency graph.  So I think that representation was mistaken.

If I missed one, Judge --

THE COURT:  The cessation and chemicals.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I don't know, obviously, Judge. Maybe Mr. Bowden can tell you how that's going to be used.  I think it is a graphic representation of what we have heard already, that 3 to 5 percent are successful at quitting.  I also think we've heard 13 million people quit, 30 million people quit.  We heard, again, for the second time on cross with Mr. Geraghty, 60 million people quit.

I don't think it's unduly cumulative for Dr. Burns to point out the success rates of people who quit smoking and how they relate to the cancer that he's going to be talking about.

THE COURT:  Mr. Geraghty.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'll just be very brief, Your Honor.  The issue in this case is we dispute whether he was addicted, Mr. Danielson, and whether the addiction was the legal cause.

There's no dispute that the man had lung cancer and that the lung cancer was the medical cause of his death.

Legal cause in this case relates to addiction and addiction causation.  That's what the Allen case says very, very clearly.  There's a whole discussion of that.  That's what's in dispute.

Dr. Burns wants to talk about how cancer grows and all that kind of stuff.  I think it is completely irrelevant.  And all of these slides are cum- -- I don't think I heard them say that they didn't touch on all these issues with Dr. Hurt and Dr. Cummings.

So I won't belabor the point any more.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.

can't even put a number on it, the chart that we've seen a bunch, is this per capita cigarette consumption.  I can't imagine that this needs to --to be seen very much at all.

I understand that it -- if I'm hearing your argument correctly, that it's simply to let the jurors know that this slide is connected with a per capita consumption lung cancer death rate slide, as basically laying the predicate or introduction to that, that they have not seen this lung cancer death rate slide, and that this witness is going to be talking about that.

MR. SCHULTZ:  And the comparison, Your Honor, just so I'm clear, on the per capita I think Dr. Burns will give a number for per capita currently and say now if you want to look on that the chart, you'll see -- on the old per capita chart where we would be back to today.  Which is not something we've heard.  It's a -- you know, a hat that gets worn in a lot of different ways depending on the purpose for which it's used.

THE COURT:  No, but we've used it in a lot of different ways in the trial.

needs to be a minor introduction to this.  Because they have seen it, they know it.

With regard to the second, they have not.  It certainly is not unduly cumulative of anything that has been presented to them and it appears to be relevant to what I understand his testimony is going to be.

There hasn't been a chart that reflects the nature or -- the listing of the additives or chemicals in cigarette smoke.  And I find that, while there's been testimony about a number of different things -- and there have been articles that have been thrown up, flashed, and different things, and some of these things mentioned.  This listing has not been mentioned, and it certainly is not cumulative.

And it's relevant.  I mean, you know, again, they're in there whether one smokes one cigarette or one smokes -- you know, one is a 30-pack-year smoker.  And the difference is, of course, the effect over time.  And I presume all that's going to be made clear in the context of the direct and cross-examination.

I don't find it objectionable.

interest, we've -- -- we've heard the numbers, specifically the 3 percent number and the -- I think the two-thirds number, which is smokers who want to try to quit.  This graphic illustration is not unduly cumulative of that information.

I'll overrule the objection in regards to the use of these. But again, it does concern me, as I look on this, that there not be repetition. We've heard from Hurt; we've heard a lot from Cummings; and this -- you know -- at this point in time, I --there does not need to be a witness to simply come in and regurgitate something that both have said.

Certainly, they can apply what has been said to their own area of expertise, and specifically to Mr. Danielson's smoking history, but, again, there's -- there's absolutely no need to replow ground that has already been heard.

And that would be my request of counsel, to make sure that you look at your questions and make sure your questions are simply not asking him for the same answer that has been given already.

MR. SCHULTZ:  We've gone to great efforts to do that, Judge.  Of course, Dr. Burns will be giving a diagnosis of addiction so that he can talk about it causing disease, but you will not see all that

evidence that you saw with Dr. Cummings on that point.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Are we ready for Dr. Burns to come in?

MR. GERAGHTY:  We're going to do Burns before Jerry Pate.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. CARPENTER:  We talked about this before, and I'll be quick.

There have been a series of questions.  Some of them are extremely disturbing from our client's point of view.  One seems to be based on the premise that we talked about that my client should be responsible at least in part for the verdict for manufacturing a product that can cause disease.

Another seems to be premising the idea of responsibility and liability on protected First Amendment lobbying activities.  And the third seems to be coming from a place where writer of the question believes cigarettes should be banned and not manufactured at all.

We don't know if that's the same person giving all those answers.  There's really no way to find out if we're unable to look at the notes.  I appreciate Your Honor's ruling on that so I'm not going to belabor that.

My concern is that if any juror gave one of these answers in voir dire or -- much less all three of them, I know Your Honor would have excused them for cause.

And when we brought this issue up initially, Your Honor said well, let's see how it goes, that might not be a bad question, let's see if it continues or if it gets better.

I think it's gotten worse, Your Honor.  And based on the nature of the questions coming out, I feel that my client is not going to be able to get a fair trial.  I think we've got at least one juror on, maybe even multiple on the panel, who seem to have some credible predisposition biases and

precepts where they're going to hold my client liable pretty much regardless of what happens.

So based on that the fact that it looks like we've got at least one biased juror deliberating, based on the questions, I've got to ask for a mistrial, respectfully.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Mr. Schultz.

MR. SCHULTZ:  I'll just say briefly, Your Honor, to assign the motives that Mr. Carpenter has assigned to jurors who -- or juror who wrote these questions requires gross speculation.

I believe he is not only misapprehending, but misrepresenting the import of the questions.  That may be his interpretation, but I don't think it's one that any reasonable or disinterested person would draw from them.

And I just want the record to be clear, we don't acquiesce to his characterizations in any respect to the questions as they've been posed, and obviously we would oppose any motion, this being the, whatever, eighth or ninth motion for mistrial thus far.

second time I've brought this up, Your Honor.  I don't do it lightly.

THE COURT: I think his problem is that there have been other motions for mistrial, and this may be that number motion. But you're correct on this issue.  This is only the second or third.

MR. CARPENTER:  Sure.  And it's a serious issue, so I don't do it lightly.  But regardless, just the merits of the issue, I think the proper course would be to find out which -- if one juror has written all three of these maybe, and get excused -- dismiss that juror and still be able to proceed with the trial.

If Your Honor doesn't want to do that, I think there's no way that we can be confident or feel secure that we're going to get a fair trial on this so we would ask for a mistrial.

THE COURT:  Okay.  In responding to it at this point, let's just assume -- although I am certainly not at all sure that this is a fact.  Let's assume it's one juror who has asked the three different questions that you believe reflect an unacceptable and inappropriate bias.

We have to look at the stage where we are in the trial; and we have to look at what we're asking

to do, is to ask questions.  And I think that this is the point where this court hasn't had an opportunity to give to them the final instructions. I haven't been -- had the opportunity yet to tell them, "Look, this is what you can consider and this is what you cannot consider."  And I think -- I am unable -- I am completely unable, even if it was the same juror asking these three questions, to -- to conclude from the mere asking of the questions that the juror is biased and incapable of -- of fairly and impartially considering the -- the case and keeping an open mind in the case.

And we did conduct an extraordinarily thorough voir dire.  I granted the defense request for questionnaire and, you know, a -- then a two-and-a-half day voir dire, and I -- so I -- at this point in time, I -- I -- it would -- I would have to be speculating to think that by asking that question it means this juror simply can't be fair and that I have reasonable grounds to believe that the juror can't be fair and impartial in the case sufficient for me to strike a juror from an existing panel.

So I would respectfully decline.  Thank you.

consideration.

THE COURT:  Sure, uh-huh.

MR. BOWDEN:  Your Honor, if I may very briefly address the Court during Dr. Burns's direct, I would like to ask at some point when he's explaining the cell process into cancer, I've got some demonstrative aids I've blown up on boards in a shaky hand.  I ask that he step down in front of the jury and explain it.  I've already advised Mr. Geraghty of it.  I have a copy of the slides for Your Honor if you'd rather view it from the stand since they won't be projected and won't be on your monitor.

May I approach?

THE COURT:  Yes, you may approach.

Mr. Geraghty, any response?

MR. GERAGHTY:  No.  I realized I left all these materials.  Can I retrieve them?

THE COURT:  Please do.

And, Mr. Geraghty, when the plaintiff's counsel asks the witness to step down, I'm going to be reminding the witness to make sure that the witness speaks up speaks clearly so that the court reporter and I can hear.  It's always a temptation and --when any witness is standing shoulder to shoulder to

the person that's asking the question is just to talk in that, you know, close conversational, intimate kind of tone.  We don't need that.  The jurors got to hear it.  I've got to hear it.  The court reporter has to hear it.  So I'll do that.

From your standpoint, Mr. Geraghty, I do invite you to go stand where you need to stand so that you can see what the jurors are seeing that he's showing and talking about at that time.  It's -- if you have to make any objections it's going to make it a little bit sort of unusual that you're back there behind the equipment making the objection; but don't you worry about that, we'll handle that.  But you don't have to ask.  If he asks him to step down and he does, you're absolutely welcome to walk around there so that you can get a good vision of him.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Thank you, Your Honor.

Anything else?

MS. GILMER:  Finally ready for Mr. Pate.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Your Honor, if I may.  I have one issue --

THE COURT:  I haven't heard from you today.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Yes, but you're about to.

I have one issue to address on Mr. Pate.  And very briefly, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  He has a tendency to kind of go on, and one of the things that he did in his deposition and, again, he did it outside the courtroom when we were talking about his golfing, he likes to gratuitously give up that people came to his house to talk with him.  It was a fact interview, and I just want to make that that's not going to come up in his testimony.  He sort of has a tendency to go on.  I just don't want it to be an issue and that he just gratuitously gives that information up in front of the jury and have them be misled that we did something wrong or somehow --

THE COURT:  Let me ask for a little bit more explanation than he likes to say people came to his house to talk to him.  What does that mean?  What is the bad thing that you think he's trying to communicate there?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  So specifically, for instance, at his deposition and, again, he did it outside, you asked him an unrelated question -- for instance, at his deposition, he's being asked if he ever talked to the plaintiff about this lawsuit.

And in giving that response, he says, "Well, you know, these lawyers came to my house and

announced.  I don't know how they got my number. They just showed up."  And he goes into sort of detail about that -- that conversation that he had with lawyers for defendant.

And, again, today I was just asking him about his golf career, just saying, I recognize there will be some people who will be very excited to know that you're here.  And he literally goes, "Oh, you know, some of your people showed up at my house.  How is that possible?  The number was unlisted.  I don't know how they got my number."  I just don't want him to get into that potentially on the stand.  I don't want to --

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  -- question, but --

THE COURT:  I get what your problem is now that you're talking about it.

Ms. Gilmer.

MS. GILMER:  Yes, Your Honor, I do not intend to ask him about that at all.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. GILMER: I would caution that if defense counsel gets up as they did in the deposition and says, "Have you talked to a lawyer? Did you meet with the plaintiff's lawyer and prep for your

testimony," or something like that.  It wouldn't surprise me if he said anything about "I've talked to lawyers from both sides.  They showed up at my house, unannounced.  I mean, I don't ask him anything that would elicit that.  They may.

THE COURT:  Okay.  May I ask you to instruct your witness on this particular issue that it's --it's likely that there will be some question that will be asked about has he talked to the lawyers for both sides and that -- and has he given a deposition in the case, that sort of thing.

But in terms of any insinuation or conversation about the lawyers for the defendant or anybody else coming to his house uninvited or -- and him having an unlisted address or phone number, anything that -- that is not an issue in the trial, and the judge has directed that it should not be addressed.

I fully expect that if he says, you know -- if somebody asks him, have you talked to a lawyer -- I don't -- you know, generally I give an instruction that is perfectly okay for a lawyer to talk to a witness before the witness takes the stand.  It's in the standard instructions, at least it is in the criminal instructions.

So, yeah, I don't even know why you need to ask

that question.  But certainly there -- there doesn't need to be a gratuitous thing to insinuate that somehow they did what they likely did, and that was they used the powers that they have to locate even an unlisted address, you know.  You know, it can be found.  But that fact has a potential for undue prejudice, and we just need to sort of not go there. I don't -- okay?

MS. GILMER:  Yes, Your Honor.  I just want to make sure I understand you correctly.  I don't want there to be some insinuation that he has spoken with us and not with them or, you know, something to imply that --

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MS. GILMER:  -- and maybe the best way which would be, if you don't answer that question, I will tell him not to bring up anything with either party.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  I haven't asked a single witness that.  I will not ask this witness that.  But what I don't want to happen is, if I have to impeach him and I go through the deposition and he somehow in going through that, because I'm going to ask if you understand it, I just don't want that coming out.  I have no intention to ask the question that would elicit anything of that sort, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  We didn't intentionally set traps for you, but they are there.

Walk for me this way, if you would, please. JEROME PATE, called as a witness by the Plaintiff, was duly sworn by the Clerk of the Court, and in answer to questions propounded, testified as follows:

THE WITNESS:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Thank you, Mr. Pate.  That chair is on rollers so be careful.  Once you're comfortably seated, roll them up as close as you can to the microphone.  What's important is when you answer the questions the attorneys are asking you, those are the folks that you need to be talking to.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Face the jury and make sure the last juror can hear.  You don't have to lean into the microphone.  If you will just pretend the microphone is not even there and you're just speaking to them directly, I think that will be the best way.

Thank you so much.

You may proceed.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

Q.   And at that time were you in junior high?

A.   I was.

Q.   Where did you go to junior high here locally?

A.   Workman Junior High.

Q.   Is that when you first met Lamar Danielson?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And Lamar, did he also go to Workman with you?

A.   I believe so, yes.

Q.   And did you and Lamar remain friends throughout high school?

A.   Yes, we did.

Q.   What about into your college years?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And still friends up until he passed away in 1995?

A.   Yes.

Q.   When you first met Lamar, was he smoking?

A.   Yes.

Q.   At that time, did you smoke?

A.   Yes.

Q.   How much did Lamar smoke compared to you?

A.   I would say -- I was not a chain-smoker.  I would smoke because it was sort of hip to smoke.  And I don't remember carrying lighters around, or I probably bummed cigarettes.  Maybe later on in college bought

cigarettes or -- but I was a light smoker, and I would say Lamar was a heavy smoker.

Q.   When you were in middle school and into high school, was smoking common for the high school students?

A.   I would not say for all -- all high school students, but those that chose to smoke, smoked.  It was sort of a cool thing to do.  And, you know, I guess when you're, whatever, 13 years old you think you're getting away with things.

I probably started to smoke -- I had brothers and sisters, and I think you're influenced by older people as a young person at that age, starting in the teenage years, and I was influenced by older people.  It was kind of a thing to do, I guess, with smoking.

Q.   And, Mr. Pate, to be clear, you were in high school in the late '60s, very early '70s; is that right?

A.   Yes, yes.

Q.   And you and Lamar, were you the same age?

A.   Well, I don't know exactly.

Q.   Same --

A.   But, yeah, I think he was born about the same time I was born in 1953, I think.

Q.   You-all were in the same grade?

A.   Same grade, yes.

Q.   Now, you mentioned that you were the type to

maybe bum cigarettes, at least in your high school days.

What about Lamar?  Was he also bumming cigarettes, or did he have a pack of his own?

A.   I would say, you know, what I remember mostly of Lamar, he had the boxed Marlboro cigarettes.  And, you know, he always liked to pack the cigarettes in the little boxtops.  And he had -- you know, it was kind of cool, the Zippo lighters, during the -- back during the Vietnam era.

And, you know, during our high school days, people would hang around the pool hall, and you'd see Vietnam veterans coming in.  They had a cigarette.  I think that, you know, you could even go back today and look at old videos of Vietnam.  It seems like every picture that you see -- that I see, all of them have people smoking in them.  And, you know, it was kind of the Ray-Ban sunglass era, and the -- the -- the Marlboro cigarettes.

And for me, it was -- it was a fad.  I mean, it was not something that -- that I knew I should be doing. It was just something I did.  And I think we -- Lamar and I did it.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Your Honor, can we approach sidebar?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  I have an objection for the record.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Your Honor, I have an objection. This is the problem with this witness.  You ask him a very narrow question.  He goes on, and he starts talking about things that are not relevant to the question being asked, and he interjects things that -- I mean, we had a long discussion yesterday on Cummings, about the things we were not able to elicit.

Now he's talking about himself -- and it's potentially misleading, that what he just talked about in his last sentence he gave, it was somehow related or linked to Lamar Danielson.  And we cannot make that link with this witness.

And I would move to have that last portion stricken, and that -- you know, I don't know if --how to do it.

MS. GILMER:  Your Honor, I think my response will --

THE COURT:  Were you done?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Yes, I am.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

MS. GILMER:  Your Honor, I think he's � he's saying what the times were like.  He's putting it in perspective.  He is the one witness we have that went to high school and grew up with Lamar.  They've objected to any other witness talking about --Micah, in particular -- what Lamar knew in high school because she didn't know him then.

We've brought in a witness to talk about what those times were like specifically here in Pensacola, where Lamar and Mr. Pate went to school together.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me say this.  Your question was:  "Now, you mentioned that you were the type to maybe bum cigarettes, at least in your high school days.

"What about Lamar?  Was he also bumming cigarettes, or did he have a pack of his own?"

That was your question.

MS. GILMER:  I agree, he's adding.

a little bit more direct responses, and I -- I don't find anything that he testified to, to be irrelevant establishing the culture within which Lamar Danielson began and smoked cigarettes at that -- at that age.  So I'm not going to strike it.

But I am going to caution you that if you don't make sure that he understands to give -- to listen to your questions and -- because you know where you're going.  You know how to get there.

MS. GILMER:  Right.

THE COURT:  So if you're not going to get direct answers out of him, then it will be up to me to have to invite him and then instruct him and then require him to give direct responses.

MS. GILMER:  I understand, Your Honor.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Your Honor, I do have the same objection that Mr. Schultz made yesterday about relevance.  Unless they establish the predicate that this was linked to Mr. Danielson, they're not going to be able to do that so they shouldn't be talking about these things.

THE COURT:  I overruled the objection.  Thank you.

BY MS. GILMER:

Q.   All right.  Mr. Pate, I'm going to ask you some questions.  For the sake of everyone in the courtroom, but especially counsel on the other side, if you'll answer the question --

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Your Honor, I'm going to object to the colloquy from plaintiff's counsel. THE COURT:  Well, thank you.

Let's just say what you're going to say without referring to counsel for the defense.  Thank you. MS. GILMER:  Sure.  Yes, Your Honor. BY MS. GILMER:

Q.   My only point was if you'll try to answer only what I'm asking you so that everyone in the courtroom knows where we're going, and it gives everyone a chance to understand the question I'm asking before you give an answer.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Thank you.

I think right before we took that brief break you were talking about kind of the culture that you and Lamar grew up in, in the late '60s, early '70s when you were in junior high and high school here in Pensacola.

Do you remember kids smoking on your high school campus back then?

A.   I would say yes.

Q.   And now, I understand you mentioned that Lamar always had a box of Marlboro Reds; is that right? A.   Yes.

Q.   Lamar wasn't old enough to buy cigarettes back then.  Do you know how he got his cigarettes?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Objection.  Speculation.  Calls for hearsay.

THE COURT:  Not if he -- it may be speculation, but I will ask the witness not to speculate and testify to only what he knows from his own personal knowledge.

Thank you. A.   To the best of my knowledge, I don't know how he purchased his cigarettes. BY MS. GILMER:

Q.   Did you ever buy cigarettes in your high school years here in Pensacola?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Objection.  Relevance. THE COURT:  Overruled.  Thank you. BY MS. GILMER:

Q.   That means you can answer.

THE COURT:  You may answer the question. A.   This is new for me. (Laughter.)

Yes. BY MS. GILMER:

Q.   How were you able to buy cigarettes in Pensacola in high school?

A.   Well.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Again, Your Honor, objection.

Relevance.

THE COURT:  I'll overrule the objection.  Thank

you.

A.   I think for me in those days you could go into -- we didn't have -- I don't remember if they were 7-Elevens.  They were called Pak-A-Saks at that time, and they were all over town.  You go into a Pak-A-Sak or go into a newsstand and buy cigarettes, if -- you came in and just grabbed them.  You know, it wasn't like today.  As I remember, they weren't necessarily behind the counter.

I mean, they were up there like buying chewing gum.  And you could throw cigarettes up and throw out your 35 cents or 25 cents -- they weren't very expensive in those, as I remember -- and buy cigarettes.  Plus there were always older people that had cigarettes.  You could get them to buy them for you. BY MS. GILMER:

understand in the '60s, early '70s, junior high was seventh, eighth and ninth grade, and then high school was 10th, 11th, and 12th; is that correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   It's a little bit different now, but high school at that time was three years?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Did you and Lamar go all three years of high school together?

A.   No.

Q.   When were you in school together, the first part of high school or the end?

A.   Tenth grade and -- okay, yeah.

Q.   After tenth grade did -- when you and Lamar went to different high schools, though, did you remain friends?

A.   We did.

Q.   And I understand you weren't with Lamar 24/7, but would you see him on the weekends?

A.   Yes.

Q.   And what about on summer breaks?

A.   Yes.

Tell us some things you guys did together.

A.   We water-skied.  You know, we hung out.  I didn't have a car, but I remember he had a car.  You know, you hung out with people -- if you didn't have a car, you hung out with people that had a car so you could get around town and go downtown to the Firehouse Restaurant, which is now McGuires.  It used to be a drive-thru.  And we would go to Jerry's Drive In out on Scenic Highway, which is still there.

We just hung out that way and water-skied. I lived on the water, and he would come over and we'd go skiing with our friends.

Q.   Mr. Pate, during these times how much -- or well, let me ask you this:  Would Lamar be smoking when you-all would hang out?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Okay.  How much would you say he smoked? Describe his smoking for us.

A.   I'll be honest, I don't ever remember seeing him when he wasn't smoking pretty much, other than when he was dead.  I mean, he smoked.  And I remember he had the Zippo lighter and flipped the lighter and had the cigarettes -- packing cigarettes, whether we were driving to -- we drove to Gainesville our senior year of high school with a couple other friends and went down to

University of Florida and determined we were going to a Florida school.

And I smoked then because I remember the other two guys didn't, and we smoked the whole way down and the whole way back.  And it was just a thing to do, I guess.

Q.   You mentioned that you smoked, that Lamar smoked.  Did you-all have other friends that smoked, or were you the only two?

A.   No.  We had a couple other friends.  Actually, both of them are dead.  Hayward Johnson who -- and I don't think either one of them died from smoking issues. They died from other natural causes.  And -- and Rodney Burrell(phonetic).   They were two good friends.  And I remember both of them had a car, so I went out with them as well.  Rodney lived about four or five doors down from Lamar.

Q.   You mentioned, Mr. Pate, that Lamar smoked Marlboro Reds.  Did you ever see him smoking any other brand of cigarettes?

A.   I didn't really ever notice any other brand. That's, you know, all I can remember.

Q.   Did you also smoke Marlboro?

A.   I smoked pretty much whatever somebody gave me. I smoked -- I could remember -- I want to say I smoked

Marlboros.  I smoked Tareytons.  I think for a while people thought Viceroys were cool because they had more -- felt like it had a bigger hit to it.  And then when I was in college I smoked Salems.  I dated a girl who went to school in North Carolina and used to bring them to me.  I smoked -- South Carolina, and they smoked Salems. And so until about my sophomore year of college I smoked, and then that's when I quit.

Q.   Mr. Pate, back in -- in those days when you were in junior high school and high school, was there more cigarette advertising than there is today? MS. DIOLOMBI:  Objection, Your Honor. Foundation and this is a lay witness

THE COURT:  Okay.  Counsel, again, we've had some testimony about this from experts.  I'm not sure just how much can be offered here. MS. GILMER:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  If you want to approach the bench and talk to me about it, I'll be glad to have you do that.

THE COURT:  General testimony from this witness about advertisement at the time, I think, would --would not be appropriate.  He's not an expert in cigarette advertisements.  I think that I would have to limit any discussion to the times that he remembers being with Mr. Danielson and what, together, they might have seen or been exposed to.

So I wouldn't say he can't testify about it at all, but I would say that, just as a general cultural thing, that -- I don't think so because I don't think he's been listed for that purpose.

So but as a fact witness, he certainly is permitted to talk about what he and Lamar saw when they were together.

MS. GILMER:  Yes, Your Honor, and that's why I wanted to approach, was to tell you that I -- I realized I've asked a poor question.  It was too broad, and I meant to ask him specifically if he recalled -- I want to lay a predicate first that he recalled seeing cigarette ads, and then he will relate directly to how he and Lamar smoked Marlboros, and he thought Lamar was like the Marlboro Man.  That was the cool thing for them to do amongst high school kids.  They all wanted to be the Marlboro Man and -- with the big horse and the

cowboy hat and all of that.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Again, the limitation is since he's not an expert on advertisements, it's --the -- the... the permissible line of inquiry is what he and Lamar together saw and said.  I mean, again, if -- if Lamar said something to him to admit or to acknowledge that the -- something about an advertisement affecting him or something like that, that's one thing.

If, you know -- if he and Lamar together had conversations about the Marlboro Man or, you know, trying to look like a cowboy or whatever and -- all that's fine.

But the general thing about how he thinks kids his age were influenced by -- I won't let you go there.

MS. GILMER:  I understand, Your Honor.

(The following proceedings were held within the hearing of the jury.) BY MS. GILMER:

Q.   Mr. Pate, when you were in high school, do you remember the Marlboro Man? A.   I do.

Q.   And is that a way that you would refer to Lamar Danielson?

A.   I wouldn't necessarily refer the Marlboro Man to Lamar Danielson, but I was very familiar with him and he... you know, as I said, was a constant smoker.  I don't know what else I can say.  I wouldn't necessarily refer him as the Marlboro Man.

Q.   I understand.  When you were in high school, do you recall any classes where they taught you that smoking was bad for your health?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Your Honor, I'm going to object to this question based on the Court's ruling yesterday.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm sorry.  Briefly approach.

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

MS. GILMER:  They went to tenth grade together and he's already testified that there were no classes.

THE COURT:  My ruling that said what? MS. DIOLOMBI:  We have shown that they went to different high schools.

MS. GILMER:  They went to tenth grade together.

THE COURT:  That is not appropriate.

MS. GILMER:  I apologize.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Yes, I am, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  If, in fact, this person testifies that he was in a high school class with Lamar Danielson and that they heard something about smoking, that's permissible.  But he can't speculate on what Lamar might have heard in a class where he was not.

So was that the nature of the objection?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Well, here's my problem.  He was specifically asked where Mr. Danielson went to high school and he said specifically in his deposition he did not remember, and now he's giving testimony.

THE COURT:  They went to high school together one year.

MS. DIOLOMBI: For a very limited amount of time. We're not limiting this discussion at all (inaudible).

THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me -- I have clearly stated that I am limiting her inquiry here to any class they were taking together where he and Lamar were sitting in class and heard such a conversation. Okay.

I understand she may not have limited the question so far and that's why we approached and we've now cleared it up.  But she's not going to be

permitted to bring up evidence that Lamar heard it in some other school in some other class that he wasn't in.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Okay.  Here's my problem.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  He's going to say that they didn't have these lessons.  He doesn't know if they had the lessons or if he had the lessons.  But if she's going to link it up that they were in the same class, they were not necessarily always in the exact same class.  Your Honor, there is not going to be that link is my problem.

If they can make the link, maybe I'm mistaken, I don't know, but from my read of the deposition, they are not going to be able to make that link to Lamar Danielson with this specific piece of information just because he went to the same junior high school.  So that's my objection.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

(The following proceedings were held within the hearing of the jury.)

THE COURT:  You may proceed. BY MS. GILMER:

Q.   Mr. Pate, how would you describe Lamar Danielson when you-all were in high school?

A.   Funny.  Pretty much calculated.  I mean, you knew where you stood with Lamar.  He would -- he was -- I thought he was pretty balanced person.  He didn't seem to have a lot of highs and a lot of lows that I can remember.

Um, he, you know, he worked hard, you know, and he worked at his dad's business.

Student, I don't remember what kind of student, you know.  We were just glad to get out of high school. But, you know, just frankly, I mean, he was the kind of guy who was liked by everybody because he wasn't a trouble-maker.

He didn't -- he didn't -- you know, I was the one that had the ability to seem like to be on the edge maybe in school.  I was competitive, and Lamar wasn't quite as competitive.  And I think he -- as I said, he was pretty much in the middle.  And you never heard him say bad things about people or -- he was just very well-liked.  And fun.  We had a lot of fun together.

Q.   And, Mr. Pate, when you picture Lamar back in your high school days, how do you picture him?

MS. GILMER:  Your Honor, if I may approach.

THE COURT:  You may.

Just take your time.

Johnson -- not Johnson Junior High.  That's where I came from.  But Workman Junior High, right.

Q.   When you met Mr. Danielson you talked about him smoking, but when you met Mr. Danielson you don't know what he was smoking -- what brand of cigarette he was smoking when you first met, right?

A.   When I first met him?  I can't recall the first day I met him.  I mean, I can't go back to 1967 and recall that today, but I do remember I met him when I entered junior high school in Pensacola.

Q.   All right.  But when you -- you've been asked or you were asked if you remembered what brand Mr. Danielson smoked when you met him, and you didn't remember what brand he smoked when you met him; is that correct?

MS. GILMER:  I'm going to object.  Improper

impeachment.

THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MS. DIOLOMBI:

Q.   Let me ask you the question again.  One moment. All right.

So let me ask you, what brand was Mr. Danielson smoking when you met him?

A.   When I met him what was he smoking?

Q.   Yes.

A.   I can't remember the first day I met him and what he was smoking that first day.

Q.   Okay.  Um, you and Mr. Danielson, you talked about going to Workman Junior High school together, and then you eventually went to a portion of high school together, right? A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.  When you were asked, you didn't remember if you -- you and Mr. Danielson had gone to high school together, correct?

A.   When I was asked?

Q.   Yeah, when you were previously asked the question of whether or not you and Mr. Danielson went to high school, you --

Q.   All right.  So you only went to high school with Mr. Danielson for a short period of time; is that right?

A.   For an entire year, school year.

Q.   For an entire school year in the tenth grade?

A.   I believe.

Q.   Okay.

A.   It -- again, we're going back to 1969, I believe.  And in those days it was logical that the kids went from Workman Junior High, where we went, we went to Pensacola High.

And then the next year, the schools were all rezoned.  I went to Booker T. Washington High to Harstry [phonetic], which is not far from there.  And, as I recall, Lamar went to one of the academies.

Q.   You don't remember which high school he went to, though, after he left, correct?

A.   I think I recalled in my statement that I think he went to the -- the liberal arts, which there were two academies.  There were -- the schools were -- were --were liberal arts and the academy which were down on 12th Avenue, they were right next door to each other. If you want I can show you where they are.

Some of the people were in one school and another, and when you left Pensacola High and we went to

Washington, I didn't know if somebody went to Woodham High or they went to Escambia High or they went to Cape High.  A lot of the kids decided they weren't going to the same schools.  Everybody kind of picked and choosed where they went.

Q.   Okay.

A.   And so he went to a private school, I believe. And I don't know that for sure, but I'm sure we can find that out.  And I think in my testimony -- in my deposition I -- but, you know, when I did my deposition a year ago, it was over a year ago, wasn't it?

Q.   Yeah.  Yes.

A.   Over a year ago.  And that was the first time I had been asked about a question about junior high and high school in 40 years, or however many years it was. But, you know, I was kind of just playing through my mind; and if you read my deposition it's like I stuttered through trying to answer as honestly and correctly as I can, because that's -- that's what I'm here for is to tell the truth.

Q.   Right.  And, you know, in fairness, I mean, let's put this in context.  Your deposition was taken May 2014, and it was the first time that you were asked to think about any of the issues that we're now asking you about in court, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.  And the events that we're talking about, I mean, you moved to Pensacola in '67; so we're talking about the '60s, the '70s, almost 50 years ago, right?

A.   Correct.

Q.   Okay.  So, again, you're being asked to go back in time and sort of remember all these things that you have not had to think about since that time frame, right?

A.   Well, I've been asked to look back a lot of things.  I mean, you think about my professional --you're asking me a question?

Q.   Right.  I'm just asking you about Lamar Danielson smoking.

A.   But I had to qualify your question.  Your question, you asked me was I able to look back first time in a long time?  I'm asked regularly.  When I took a bus from Anniston, Alabama, in 1964 by myself to play in the southern -- southeastern junior golf tournament. I've got a picture of me with Arnold Palmer when I went through Tupelo to go to Memphis to -- a photograph of Arnold Palmer when I was ten years old.  And I can vividly remember that because that was a big event in my life.

And so moving to Pensacola in '67 was a big

event, and meeting new friends was a whole new chapter in my life.  So for me to remember the people that became my friends, they went on to be in my wedding and people I spent time with, yeah, I remember these events. I don't remember exactly what day school started in 1969.  I can remember, you know, a teacher that I had in algebra that kidded me because I -- I played golf.  And I can remember taking driver's education in Pensacola High.  And I can also remember being the first white student at Booker T. Washington High School, and being part of that.  So...

Q.   And in fairness, Mr. Pate, all I was really asking you was just that since that time and until the time of your deposition, I mean, your deposition, I think you've already testified, that's the first time that you were asked questions about Mr. Danielson smoking and having to give answers to those questions.

A.   Exactly.  That was the first time I was deposed.

Q.   Okay.

A.   Over a year and a half ago; is that right?

Q.   May 2014.

A.   Yeah.

Q.   So a little over a year, yeah.

with Lamar Danielson, he worked weekends at his family's funeral home, correct?

A.   I don't know if he worked every weekends, but he did work at the funeral home.  And I would see him there on the weekends at times, yes.

Q.   All right.

A.   I'm not sure if he had regular hours, you know, again, you're 17 years old, 16, 17 years old.

Q.   Right.  Of course.

But when you would go to visit him when he was working at the funeral home, he was usually working the graveyard shift on your visit; is that right?

A.   When I went to visit him it was mostly in -- in the evenings.  Excuse me.  Because during the daytime I was either working or playing golf.  And we would go visit him because we could hang out up there and watch TV and just be guys up there.

Q.   All right.

Now, when he was working his job he would answer phones at the -- at -- and work while you guys were sort of hanging around and watching television, drinking beer and smoking; is that right?

A.   I don't know about answering telephones.  I don't know how much phones he answered -- phones plural -- but, I mean, he would answer the phone if the

phone rang, I'm sure.

Watching television, we -- as I testified, I can remember the first time I -- he ordered for me a Whataburger, double meat, double cheese with mustard, onions and pickles cut in half.  And somebody would order it, and we would run up the street up on Highway 29 and either get a pizza at Pizza Hut or get a Whataburger and bring it back and sit there, and we would hang around a couple of hours and, you know, go home when it was time to go home.

And I don't know if he spent all night there. I think he stayed there late nights because of having to wait for people to call from the hospital.  If someone would die, they would have to organize the pick-up of the dead bodies.

Q. I'm really just asking about the time that you spent with him at the funeral home when he was working. That's the time frame I'm talking about.

A.   Right.

Q.   Is that fair?

A.   Right.

beer.  We might have drank it out at the car or had already drank beer, but -- yes.  I would say maybe not much, but, you know, we -- we weren't heavy drinkers, but we would -- we would have a beer here and there.

Q.   Have a beer here and there, but you weren't allowed to drink in the funeral home; is that right?

A.   We weren't allowed to drink at the funeral home?

Q.   Yes.

A. I don't think -- I don't know if we were or we weren't. I didn't never ask anybody if we were allowed or not.

Q.   All right.

A.   On something I said a year and a half ago?

A.   Okay.

Q.   All right?

A.   And what may I do with this?

Q. If you would just hang on to it for now, if you could. I might ask you some questions about it. I just wanted you to have it ready.

A.   Thank you.  Thank you.

Q.   All right?

Now, you talked about some of your friends smoking around -- when you would hang out with Mr. Danielson at the funeral home, right?

A.   Yes.

Q.   You can't recall a specific time that Mr. Danielson ever smoked around his parents in high school, correct?

A.   Specifically I think -- I would think -- I'm not sure.  I -- again, I can't recall specifically a time when he smoked around his parents, specifically. But I do know we both smoked and smoked at the funeral home.

Q.   Okay.  Well, I'm asking specifically.  If his father was at the funeral home, Lamar Danielson would not be smoking in front of his father, correct?

A.   I don't know that.

A.   Yeah.

Q.   Let's go there.

A.   Okay.

Q.   And if -- let's go to Page 62 of your deposition, and just let me know when you get there. And if you will, look at Line 7 when you get there.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Just let me know when you're there.

A.   Yeah, I see that, Line 7.

Q.   Okay.  So let me -- let me read it.

Now, we've already talked about it, but you were deposed on May 6th, 2014.  You can see that on the front cover of the deposition, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   All right.  And when you were deposed, you were -- hang on one second.

You were put under oath, correct?

A.   Yes, ma'am.

Q.   All right.  You swore to tell the truth, and just as you did here in this courtroom today, right?

instructed you that if you answered a question, it would be assumed that you understood the question, right?

And if not, you were asked to let the person questioning you know so that they could rephrase their question; is that right?

A.   I don't remember that.

Q.   Okay.  You know what?  You can look at that if you go to Page 3 of your deposition.

A.   Okay.

Q.   Let's just do that.  Line 19.

A.   Okay.

Q.   And just take a moment to look at that.

A.   All right.

Q.   Right.

MS. GILMER:  Your Honor, I'm going to object.

She asked the exact same question.  He's given the

exact same answer.  It's improper impeachment.

THE COURT:  Right now on what she's asking him

to do, to go to the deposition and look at that Page

3, Line 19, I'll certainly permit him to go ahead

and to do that.

I don't have a copy of the deposition to

determine whether or not it is impeachment, a proper

impeachment, but obviously the -- to be a proper

impeachment, the answer would have to be different

Do you have an extra copy for me? MS. DIOLOMBI:  I sure do. THE COURT:  Thank you. MS. DIOLOMBI:  May I approach? THE COURT:  You may. Thank you.

When you finish looking at Page 3, Line 19, that section there, just let her know.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.  I've looked at it. THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you. BY MS. DIOLOMBI:

Q.   So my -- my question to that was just that you were instructed that it would be assumed the questions you were asked were understood if you answered.  And if not, you were asked to let the person questioning you know, correct?

That was from Page 3 of your depo, right? A.   Yes.

Q.   So when I asked you a bit ago, was -- and let me ask you -- and let me just ask the question again.

Did Mr. Danielson -- do you have a recollection of Mr. Danielson smoking around his parents when he was in high school?

A.   Do I have a recollection of it?

Based on what I'm remembering today, I don't have a recollection of him smoking that -- today.  Now, I might have said that a year and a half ago.  When you're asking about somebody from 20 years before that, there's been another two years -- again, I'm not here in court studying this deposition.  But to the best of my knowledge, I do not remember Lamar -- I would say --you're talking about in high school?

Q.   Yes.

A. In high school, it -- I don't know if we were smoking around his dad or not. I probably was, and --and -- and I don't know.

But I can't -- I can't honestly say I can remember smoking -- that he was smoking around his dad. I can't right now today remember that.

Q.   Okay.

A.   Again, I'm getting two years older every two years and a year and a half older from last year.  When you asked me or your person asked me -- they asked me how many pages of questions two years ago, year and a half ago...

Q.   Right.  So I'm asking -- so -- and I apologize.

A.   It was like a three-hour deposition that you asked me -- so you ask me to qualify one statement that I might have made?  In fact, if you read it -- let me

Reading it last night, 16 different directions trying to trip me up that I might say technically he did or didn't.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  I'm going to object. THE COURT:  Let me just ask you.  What's your next question?

THE WITNESS:  I mean, I think you're being unfair to me.  I'm trying to tell the truth, to the best of my knowledge.

THE COURT:  Mr. Pate, hang on a minute; she may have a question for you.  What is your question?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Your Honor, my question is just if his father was at the funeral home.  Lamar --

THE COURT:  Give me a line.  I've got Page 62. Give me a line where you think he's been impeached. MS. DIOLOMBI:  Pardon?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Line 7 to 11, Your Honor.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  I thought I asked a question. From what I heard, I didn't believe I got the answer to it.  There's clear impeachment on the question, I thought, that he did not give me on the record. That's just -- and I could have misheard him.  But to now leave these jurors with the impression that I'm somehow trying to trick him when I've given him his deposition and he's had the opportunity to look at his deposition, he was instructed at the end of the deposition that he could look at it.

To now leave this false impression that I'm somehow trying to trick him or do anything improper, it is out of bounds, Your Honor, and the jury should disregard his last statements.  I wasn't trying to trick him.

THE COURT:  Okay.  The last statement that he made that we're talking about --

MS. DIOLOMBI:  It wasn't responsive.

THE COURT:  -- "I mean, I think you're being unfair to me.  I'm trying to tell the truth, to the best of my knowledge."

That is what you're wanting me to tell this jury to --

mean, he went on this tirade, Your Honor.  I'm not trying to do that.

THE COURT:  When you ask me to intervene, I've intervened.  I even intervened when you didn't ask me to, to explain to him that -- without (inaudible).  Please just give us direct responses as possible.  I'm here to help you in that regard. It is my job to assist you with the -- if you have a (inaudible) a witness who is being obstructive in any way.

He has testified that he's unfamiliar with this.  I'll accept that, but it still doesn't excuse -- doesn't give him a privilege to say things that are inappropriate.  He's here to answer questions.  So I don't have a problem telling him that.  Okay?

With regard to the last question or the last thing he said, I'll be delighted to tell the jury that that statement, they shall disregard that, and they shall not consider it in their deliberations.

Okay.  What else do you need from me?

MR. GERAGHTY:  May I be heard very briefly?

THE COURT:  Typically, I don't let both argue, but if you have something that you just feel compelled to say or you're going to explode.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm not going to explode, but I feel compelled to say just two things very briefly. If Your Honor does make that instruction, I would ask that you not repeat his answer and everything he said.

THE COURT:  The only way that I know --

MR. GERAGHTY: The entire last answer was not even in response to any question that was posed to him at that point.  So I just --

THE COURT:  You can't tell him how to disregard.  I mean, I can't say disregard his last response.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'd ask you to strike the last response.  Tell the jury you're striking the last response of the witness.

And the thing I'm going to say, Your Honor, I understand, but, you know what?  This is very calculated.  I'm going to say this so it's clear on the record.  He made a point to say, "Oh, you're from Miami."  He looked over at the jury.  We all know we're in Pensacola.  This is all -- I'm sorry. Your Honor may not feel that way, but from my vantage point, this is all being done by this witness on purpose to try to make Ms. Diolombi and us look like we're -- the whole speech about "I was

the first person to go to Booker T. Washington High School.  I mean, this has gotten -- his responses are completely nonresponsive.  And this has become very, very bad.

So that's why I would simply request you just tell the jury, "please, my request is the last answer is stricken."  I would leave it at that and then let's try to wrap this up, because all he's here to do -- personally I'm not saying it's Ms. Gilmer or Mr. Schultz, but he's here to try to get little whatever digs in he can get.

That last answer where he said, "I read the deposition last night and your lawyer asked me six" -- he's a very sophisticated man.

THE COURT:  That wasn't his last answer.

MR. GERAGHTY:  During that last answer he made the comment about how the lawyer asked him 16 different --

THE COURT:  What was his last answer?  That's my point, because when you say tell the jury to disregard his last answer, that's --

jurors.  I want to just tell the truth, and my friend that" -- that's the last thing that I have here that tells me what he said.

So that doesn't go to that other thing.  If it's the ultimate part you-all want to tell them to disregard --

MR. GERAGHTY:  I move to strike the last two comments the witness made.  The last comment wasn't even in response to a question.  He just made a speech.

I don't want to keep us up here any longer. The jury probably wants this to move on, and I want to move it on, because I think he's just -- I know why I think he's here.  Your Honor probably disagrees, but that's fair.  But I just think we need to get him out of here.  That's my thought.

MS. GILMER:  Your Honor, my only brief comment would be you can say what you feel is necessary to say to strike his last comment, but I don't want the jury to be left with thinking his answer about not knowing if Lamar ever smoked in front of his parents is what is being stricken.  I just want that to be clear.

Ms. Diolombi asked him two or three times about that.  He gave the same answer every single time.  I

understand why he got upset when she tries to impeach him.  He gave the same answer three times. I mean, they're asking open-ended questions.  They can get him on and off without any questions of him.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  I had a very short exam for this witness.  It's just taking longer.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Do you have continued -- I mean, the -- there are two things that he's said, and they're not the last two things he said.  See, that's the problem with not telling them that, so I can't just say disregard the last two things he said.

But there was a statement that he said.  I mean, I think you're being unfair to me.  I'm trying to tell the truth, to the best of my knowledge. That was one thing.

And then there was the (perusing realtime) one that was right before that in which he said, "I'm getting two years older every two years and a year and a half older from the last year when you asked me -- the person asked me -- they asked me how many pages of questions two years ago a year and a half ago.

It was like a three-hour deposition that you asked me -- so you ask me to qualify one statement

that I might have made?  In fact, if you read it --let me say this.  If you read this deposition, you asked the same questions."

So do you see when you say disregard, it really gets complicated for the jury.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, I'll tell you what, Judge, I'm saying this tongue in cheek, but I'll move to strike every answer he's given --

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GERAGHTY:  -- just to move this along. But, I mean, however Your Honor wants to say it.

THE COURT:  You can't instruct the jury to disregard without telling them what I'm going to tell them to disregard.  Okay.  I mean, that's what told me to do, because it will bring more attention to it, is what I understood you to say.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yeah, of course.

THE COURT:  So at this point in time, the very last thing that he said, do you want me to tell them to disregard that short thing there that he's just here to tell the truth?  I'11 tell them disregard that.  But if we go beyond that, then it's going to have to be more specific.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'll tell you what, Your Honor --

THE COURT:  I know this places you in a difficult position.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yeah.  You're -- I don't feel like I'm being given any remedy that will fix this problem, and I understand that, and Your Honor is not here to fix my problems.

THE COURT:  Please listen to me.  I have -- I was trying to make it clear to you that I have no problem giving instructions to the witness.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Well, then here's � I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt you, Your Honor.  Go ahead and finish, please.  I apologize.

THE COURT:  I don't have any problem instructing the witness to give direct responses to the question.  I asked Ms. Gilmer to do it, and I warned Ms. Gilmer if he's not going to be responsive, then I would give them an instruction to do that.  (Inaudible) still wasn't responsive, I would give them a direction to do that.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Then here's what I would request.  I would ask that you admonish the witness one more time that he needs to limit himself to only answering the questions that are posed to him and ask the jury to disregard any speeches he makes.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Because he's already made three.

THE COURT:  Thank you .

Anything else?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  No, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Thanks.

(The following proceedings were held within the hearing of the jury.)

THE COURT:  Let me just remind you.  We're --you're in a unique position here as a witness, and it's a very limited role.  And I know it's not comfortable to some people, but I'm going to need to ask you to simply limit your response as directly as you can to answering the question that's asked.

If either Ms. Gilmer or Ms. Diolombi ask you a question, then try to be as direct in your response and as succinct as you can.  If they feel like they need to ask you something more, they're good lawyers, they know how to do that.  So at this point that would be my request.

Thank you.

A.   Yes.

Q.   All right.  So you left home and you actually won the U.S. Open in 1976, right, so golf was your main focus throughout that time frame, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q.   Now, you talked about smoking in school.  When you were in junior high school, you don't recall smoking on the school campus because you were afraid of the consequences of smoking in school, correct?

A.   I was afraid of the consequences at home.

Q.   Okay.  All right.  So you didn't smoke on your school's campus, correct?

A.   I can't remember exactly, but I'm sure that I was afraid of the consequences, yes.

Q.   And one of the consequences of getting caught smoking in school was that the teachers would punish you if you were caught smoking, correct?

A.   Yes.

Q. And you don't recall any students openly smoking in front of any teachers when you were in school, correct?

A.   Openly in front of any teachers?

Q.   In front of any teachers.

A.   Not that I'm aware of, openly smoking in front of teachers.

Q.   Mr. Pate, do you have any idea how many cigarettes a day Mr. Danielson was smoking in the late 1960s?

A.   I have no idea.

Q.   Do you have any idea how many cigarettes a day he was smoking during the 1970s? A.   I have no idea.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Thank you, sir.  I have no further questions for you.

THE COURT:  Thank you, Ms. Diolombi.

MS. GILMER:  Nothing further, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Mr. Pate, the way this works in a civil trial is that the jurors may have some questions that they would like to ask you.  So what we do is we invite them, if they have any questions, to write those questions down.  And then we'll see if they're appropriate, then we would ask those questions, so if you'll bear with us just a moment.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.  Thank you.

And no golf questions.

(The jury exited the courtroom at 2:56 p.m.)

(The following proceedings were held outside of the hearing of the jury.)

THE COURT:  I would ask you, if you would, to step outside the front door.  We're going to talk about these questions, and then we'll make a decision, and then we'll invite you back in.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

(Mr. Pate exits the courtroom at 2:56 p.m.)

THE COURT:  Okay.  Everyone, you may be seated. The jury is out of the courtroom.

Okay.  The first question:  "Smoking on high school campus was forbidden.  Students know why?"

So this would have had -- I guess the question would call for were the students told why smoking on campus was forbidden.

But it -- but, again, the simple question is: "Smoking on high school campus was forbidden. Students know why?"

MS. GILMER:  Yeah, you know, Your Honor, he may know what the students were told.  I don't think he can say the students know why.  Maybe I misheard something.  I thought his testimony was in junior high it was forbidden.  In high school they did

smoke on campus. So I'm a little confused by the whole half question/half statement they've got in there.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So you're suggesting that I do or do not ask that question?

MS. GILMER:  I would say do not.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me ask defense.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  No, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Ms. Diolombi, are you going to be responding?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Yes, I am responding, and I would not ask the question.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Next question.  I won't give it because both have indicated that you request I not.

The first question is:  "You stopped smoking. Why?"

MS. GILMER:  Your Honor, I would say it's not relevant.  We have an order in limine on other people smoking unless it was communicated to Lamar Danielson as to why they stopped smoking, and my understanding is he's not going to be able to lay that predicate.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Your Honor, they opened the door.  They asked him questions about the culture of

smoking.  And he went to school with Lamar, and they were friends, and he was allowed to talk about his smoking.

So in -- in fairness, they should -- he should get to answer that question.

MS. GILMER:  It still isn't evidence -- you know, it's still not relevant or show any evidence as to what was in Lamar's mind.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Over the objection of plaintiff, I'll give that question.  Of course, you're both going to have an opportunity to follow up on that.

Next question:  "You seem to have cared much for your friend Lamar.  Did you ever ask him to quit smoking?"

MS. GILMER:  Your Honor, truthfully, that's beyond the scope.  I think both sides intentionally cut that part out.  It gets into a huge mess of -- I think you're going to end up with a lot of --

MS. DIOLOMBI:  We agree.

process, or did you just one day decide to quit and lay down the cigarettes?"

That seems to be encompassed in the other question, which was more succinctly stated:  "You stopped smoking.  Why?"

MS. GILMER:  I agree, Your Honor.  I think getting into this next one, there's no relevancy to it, again, to Mr. Pate specifically, how he stopped and stuff like that.  He's not going to be able to relate any of that back to Lamar Danielson.  It was college years.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  We agree, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So do ask the question: "You stopped smoking.  Why?"

Do not ask the question:  "How did you stop smoking?  Was it a process, or did you just one day decide to quit and lay down the cigarettes?"

I don't get the distinction why one is good --is a good question and the other is a bad question.

MS. GILMER:  Well, truthfully, Your Honor, we objected to both of them.

THE COURT:  You're not the ones I'm actually talking to about that.

So help me understand the distinction, why the first question is okay and the second one is not,

Ms . Diolombi.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Well, here is my concern with this witness.  You saw what happened on cross-examination with him.  He has a tendency to ramble.  When he was asked these sorts of questions at his deposition, he went into a long discussion about addiction and all of these -- these -- those types of things.  And I just worry that he's going to do the same thing here, and we're going to open up a whole can of worms, and the testimony is really convoluted in the deposition.  That particular question, when you start talking about processes, this witness is going to go there.

THE COURT:  But you don't think he's going to go there with "You stopped smoking.  Why?", which just says here's an open door, go wherever you want to go with it?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Well, I mean �

MR. GERAGHTY:  Fair point, Your Honor.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  That is a fair point.  That's true, Your Honor.  But, I mean -- "You stopped smoking.  Why?"

I -- I think in my mind it should be an innocuous question.  But, I don't know, when you start talking about processes is where I'm

concerned.  I don't think the first question kind of gets you there, but I definitely think the second question does get you there.

MS. GILMER:  Your Honor, I will just say briefly:  He was asked that in his deposition.  You stopped smoking -- or I don't know if he was asked that or he volunteered that information.  And I think, just to be prepared, he's probably going to give a long and convoluted answer.  He's not going to be able to just say, yes, I stopped smoking.

THE COURT:  I think the first question that I said I would give would -- I anticipate his answer to contemplate the things that are asked in that next question.  So since neither side wants me to ask that -- the second question I mentioned, I -- I would stick with just the first one.

The next question is:  "When you started smoking, did you know smoking was addictive and dangerous to your health?"

MR. GERAGHTY:  Your Honor, I'm going to stand up on this one because I just -- brief -- you asked this very pointedly:  What's the difference between the second question, which we said asked, and the fourth question, which we said don't ask?  And you made a fair point.

And before Your Honor made that last comment, I was going to come forward and say you know what --and in light of what I said to Your Honor at the sidebar, I would agree that the second question should be asked either in light of plaintiff's counsel's objection, so we'll stipulate to that as well.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That's the question of: "You stopped smoking.  Why?"

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  It shouldn't be asked either?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yeah.  So so far we're or zero for four, by my count.  MS. GILMER:  My response truthfully to the last question was going to be if we're going to ask him you stopped smoking and why, then I think he has to answer this last one as well. So if you're going to withdraw all of it, then I would agree, don't ask any of them.

THE COURT:  Okay.  So the one we're on right now, when you started smoking, did you know smoking was addictive and dangerous to your health.  All the rest of them are out right now.  The parties are stipulating don't ask those questions.  So we're on this one.

MS. GILMER:  Based on that, if all the other

questions are out, then, yes, Your Honor.  Unless it was communicated to Lamar then I don't think it's a proper question.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Agreed, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.

The next question:  Would you describe yourself and Lamar as normal teenagers?  You did and behaved just like most male teenagers at the time?

MS. GILMER:  I think that's a fair question.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  I think that's speculation, Your Honor.  I mean, normal, what's normal?  And then he's speculating about universe of boy -- I don't think this witness should be offering that opinion.  It's a lay opinion.  He's not an expert. We've had experts --

THE COURT:  He's not asked to describe all teenagers, just himself.  Did he consider himself and his friends as normal teenagers?  I would give tha t que s ti on.

Next:  How did Lamar react when he learned that you stopped smoking?

MS. GILMER:  I don't know if there's any evidence Lamar knew that he stopped smoking.  I would say that's an improper question.

front end that we weren't going to have any questions, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'm just saying.  Something to think about.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Yeah, yeah.  I've done that in other cases.  I should have thought of that here.

MS. GILMER:  It's a fair question, I get it, but I don't know that we haven't established that Lamar even knows -- whether Lamar ever knew he quit or why.  I mean, I would say don't ask it.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  We -- we agree.  We agree.

THE COURT:  Okay.  You agree on that one.

Do you remember how much Lamar used to smoke, number of cigarettes or packs?

MR. GERAGHTY:  Those were the last two questions.

MS. GILMER:  I mean, if we go back -- I think -- I mean, how much he smoked.  I mean, it's a relevant question.  I think we covered it but...

THE COURT:  If they don't think we covered it then it's a fair question.  If the person who wrote this question didn't hear the answer it seems like it's a fair question.

MS. GILMER:  Read the question one more time.

THE COURT:  It might be slightly cumulative

of -- an answer already given, but it doesn't hurt, because it's -- the question is do you remember how much Lamar used to smoke, parentheses, number of cigarettes or packs, closed parentheses.

MS. GILMER:  We don't have a problem with it.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I don't know how to describe that in the record to indicate that's an affirmative.  If it's just --

MR. GERAGHTY:  Sorry, Your Honor.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  I guess we -- we have no objection.

THE COURT:  I'm not sure.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  I have to read it again.  No objection, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Thank you.  All right.

When you were smoking would you consider yourself an addicted smoker or a social smoker, parentheses, one who only smokes with friends or other people who smoked, closed parentheses?

MS. GILMER:  I don't think he's qualified --it's an expert opinion.  I don't think he's qualified to give it.

THE COURT:  The question is not for an expert opinion.  "Would you consider yourself?"  That's the way the question is posed.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Well, and Your Honor, I think if I'm right, there's an order on lay witness testimony on addiction and in this jurisdiction it's out.  So he shouldn't be asked the question based the -- I think it's an Escambia ruling -- on the Escambia ruling about lay witness testimony on addiction. Whether it's his or anybody else's.

MS. GILMER:  We agree.  It's irrelevant either way, so we'd agree it shouldn't be asked.

THE COURT:  Question:  How many packs did you smoke per day at your peak of smoking?

MS. GILMER:  Um, I mean, first I was going to say it's beyond the scope.  I did ask him to compare how much he smoked to Lamar Danielson.  I don't think he ever gave a specific pack per day for either one of them.  I mean, it's similar to some of these other questions they've been asking.

I mean, I guess it's -- what was it?  How many packs per day did you smoke?

THE COURT:  How many packs did you smoke per day at your peak of smoking?

MS. GILMER:  I think it's a fair question.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I'm just trying to clarify, Your Honor.  This is another juror now with questions?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Okay.  So this is the first question from a new juror.

THE COURT:  Yes.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  I didn't know if you were done.

MS. GILMER:  I am.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  I'm going to object, Your Honor, as to relevance.  It has no bearing on any of the issues in this case.

MS. GILMER:  He did do a comparison, Your Honor, of how much he smoked to Lamar.  So, I mean, I think it's a fair question for them to ask to figure out how much he smoked.

THE COURT:  Yeah, here's � well... okay.  My understanding is he -- is he said he stopped smoking in his sophomore year of college.

MS. GILMER:  Correct.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MS. GILMER:  I guess, Your Honor, so we know his smoking occurred -- I mean, it was within the scope of the direct, which was limited really to high school, junior high, high school, early college years.

THE COURT:  The -- because of... okay, I'll give this question.

Here's another question:  Would you consider yourself having ever been addicted to cigarettes?

Consistent with the other statement, you don't want me to ask him that one; is that correct, plaintiffs?

MS. GILMER:  That's correct.

THE COURT:  Defendants?

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Agreed, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Question: Did you ever ask Lamar to quit smoking?

MS. GILMER: I think we have almost the exact same question already. We've both agreed. That's where it gets into some convoluted testimony later in life.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Agreed, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  That will not be given.

Do you recall the date when you knew cigarette smoking was bad for you?

MS. GILMER: I think without a predicate that he communicated it to Lamar it's irrelevant.

THE COURT:  So you don't want me to give it?

MS. GILMER:  That is correct, Your Honor.

MS. DIOLOMBI:  Agreed, Your Honor.

question on you stopped smoking and why and we took that out. So I think for the same reasons we would say this is a question that shouldn't be asked.

MR. GERAGHTY:  Maybe we should just start all over and bring them in here --

THE COURT:  Well, I don't think you want to do that.

(Laughter.)

I am pretty sure that's not what you want to do.

MR. GERAGHTY:  I meant that as a joke.

THE COURT:  So you are saying no, don't give that question?

MS. GILMER:  Correct, Your Honor.  Defense agrees.

THE COURT:  All right.  Those are all that I have.

MS. GILMER:  I decided that when we have long breaks up there, that's when decide to ask these questions.  No more of those.

And as I've mentioned to the jurors before, we discuss these questions because some of them --sometimes are perhaps not from an evidentiary standpoint or procedural standpoint or pleading standpoint relevant or appropriate, so we have to go through and determine which ones we feel like we can ask.

And so I'm going to be asking you just a few questions here.

First question:  Would you describe yourself and Lamar as normal teenagers?  You did and behaved just like most male teenagers at the time, question mark.

THE WITNESS:  I can't decide what normal is, but I would say we were not -- I don't know how to define normal.  That's a -- that's a broad definition.  But we didn't get arrested.  We really were rarely in trouble.  We had good parents, moms and dads and brothers and sisters.

And we went to church and we went to school and we passed our grades.  I don't remember failing, or Lamar either.  And we had a desire to go on to school and make good of ourselves.  So I guess that's what we were taught growing up.  I call that normal but maybe that wasn't normal.

THE COURT: The next question: Do you remember how much Lamar used to smoke, parentheses, number of cigarettes or packs, closed parentheses?

THE WITNESS:  I can't count packs, but I will say this:  I don't ever remember him other than maybe waterskiing in the water when he didn't have a cigarette.  If it was -- if he was able to smoke, he was smoking.

And nonstop.  I mean, he was a chain-smoker.

THE COURT:  Next question:  How many packs did you smoke per day at your peak of smoking?

THE WITNESS:  Probably... in my peak of smoking probably one pack, and I would say that was back when I was smoking Salems in college.

THE COURT:  All right.  Thank you, sir.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  At this time the attorneys have an opportunity, if they wish, to follow up to ask any follow-up questions to the responses that you just gave.

Ms. Gilmer.

MS. GILMER:  Nothing from the plaintiff, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Ms. Diolombi.
