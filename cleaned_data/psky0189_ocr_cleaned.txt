Q. And do you receive stock options?

A.  I don't receive stock options per se, but I am eligible for long-term incentives, which ultimately becomes stock.

Q. And how does that work? Can you explain that a little further?

A. The long-term incentive program is one that, depending upon the performance of the company, and based on your level, there are certain levels that are eligible for the program and depending upon the performance, there would be shares of stock awarded after a three-year period.

Q. Did you get any of these incentives in 2011?

A. For the 2011 year, yes, I did.

Q. Is that part of you mentioned earlier?

A. No.

Q. What was the level of the incentives that you received in 2011?

A. The award that I received there I believe was about     shares of stock.

me see if I can clarify a little bit.  The shares of stock, are those currently

shares that you can sell?

A. Yes, once they're  after the period  after you vest, then they are provided as stock. I own the stock at that point in time, I can sell it or not.

Q. So those     stocks vested in

2011, fully vested?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you receive any shares of stock that were not yet fully vested in 2011?

A. No.

Q. Do you know what those     shares are worth?

A. The stock price currently is a little over $40 per share.

Q.  I didn't bring my calculator, but if I'm doing that right, is that about

Q. How do you keep track of that time?

A. I don't keep track of it other than just to note the time that I am spending. I mean, no formal recording.

Q. Do you write it down somewhere?

A. No.

Q. You just note it in your head?

A.  I just note it.

Q. The 12 hours that you spent on this case, did that include meeting with lawyers?

A. It did, yes.

Q.  Did that include looking at documents?

A. It involved also, in addition to meeting with lawyers, looking at my reliance list, reviewing some of the documents there, yes.

Q. How did you prepare for the deposition, this deposition?

A. I reviewed a number of documents to become familiar with the case; the notice of deposition, some interrogatories to understand something about the plaintiff and tobacco use history and so on, to understand about the decedent and the cause of death, to

understand about Mr. Hiott and Mrs. Hiott, I reviewed a couple of pages of a deposition of Mrs. Hiott to understand something about the number of packs per day or per week, that the amount of the cigarettes that Mr. Hiott used on a regular basis. In addition, I looked through my reliance list, I reviewed selected certain documents from my reliance list.

Q.  Did you meet with counsel for R. J. Reynolds?

A.  Yes.

Q. Who did you meet with?

A.  I met Mr. Kreiner and Ms. Nuzum.

Q. Anybody else?

A.  No.

Q.    Did you ever talk with anyone else, any other counsel for R. J. Reynolds about the Hiott case?

A. No.

Q. How much time did you spend meeting with Mr. Kreiner and Ms. Nuzum?

A. We've met for a couple of hours on three different occasions, probably, of the 12, seven, eight hours.

Q. When was the first time you met

with them?

A.  Let's see.  That would have been about a week ago.

Q. When was the first time you were contacted about possibly being a witness in this case?

A.  In February.

Q, How were you contacted?

A. There was a phone call.

Q.    From who?

A.  From Ms. Nuzum.

Q. Did she give you documents to review after that?

A. No.

Q. When did you get the case specific documents that you talked about reviewing? By "case specific," I mean the specific transcripts in this case and anything having to do with this case.

A. During my meetings with counsel, I wanted to learn about the case, and those were provided as a basis to understand about it.

Q. So you requested these case specific documents?

A.  Yes.

Q. Now, you said that you had reviewed some case specific documents with regard to the cigarettes that Kenny Hiott smoked, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Any other information specifically that you were looking for in the case specific documents?

A. No, other than what I indicated in the earlier answer, just to learn about the plaintiff in the case and to learn about the brands that Mr. Hiott smoked, to understand something about his smoking history, when he began smoking and so on.  So nothing more than that.

Q. Are you prepared to give an opinion today as to whether or not Kenny Hiott was addicted to nicotine?

A.  I am not an expert in the area of addiction, so no, I'm not.

Q. Are you prepared to give an opinion today on whether or not Kenny Hiottfs lung cancer was caused by cigarette smoking?

A. No, I'm not.

Q.    Are you prepared to give any opinion in this case whether or not Kenny Hiott had or did not have any disease that was caused by an addiction to nicotine?

A.  I am prepared to offer the opinion that the risks for tobacco-related disease come from exposure to toxicants in cigarette smoke and that nicotine is addictive, but isn't considered a significant threat to health, so the potential risks for disease are associated with exposure to compounds other than nicotine.

Q. Are you prepared to give an opinion today as to how much Kenny Hiott smoked?

A. It's my understanding from the page or two of the deposition that I read from Mrs. Hiott that he smoked a pack a day.

Q. Okay. Do you have an understanding of the term "Engle case"?

A. I do, yes.

Q. What is your understanding?

A. My understanding is that this was a case that was originally in a class action in Florida, that that class action was decertified and other individual cases that

have come from that original action that are being brought to the courts individually and that the findings from the original case are the basis of those cases.

Q. And do you have an understanding that this is an Engle case, this Hiott case?

A. I do, yes.

Q. What other Engle cases have you worked on?

A. I have worked on a case, I will use just the last names, but Reiss, Callaway, Hallgren.

Q,     Is that it?

A.  Yes.

Q. Are those all cases that you testified in, either by deposition or at trial?

A. Yes.

Q. Which one was trial and which were depositions only?

A. The first two  well, all three were depositions, but I appeared only once at trial in Hallgren.

Q. How much time have you spent working on Engle cases in the past year?

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424       www.veritext.com        (212) 490-3430

A.  In the past year, I don't know how many hours.  I would say that probably  I mean, it goes through peaks and valleys. No more than five percent of my time on average

Q. If I expanded that to the past two years, would it still be five percent?

A. It would. Perhaps less.

Q. Have you turned down any Engle cases that you were asked to participate in?

A.  I have not, no.

Q.  So these three that you mentioned are the only three that you were asked to participate in?

A. Those were the only ones that I have provided testimony in. I have been named in other cases.

Q. How many other cases were you named in?

A.  I have been named in about 50.

Q.    Do you know why you were not asked to provide testimony in the other cases that you were named in that were not Reiss, Callaway or Hallgren?

A.  I don't know specifically.  I think there is a variety of reasons.  It may not

have reached that stage yet in the process, some, they may no longer be active. But, no, I don't know all of the individual reasons.

Q. When was the first time you were asked to participate in an Engle case?

A. That would have been in 2010.

Q, Which case was that?

A. Reiss was the first one that I participated in.

Q. Who first contacted you about that?

A.  I don't recall. I was aware that there were a number of these cases pending. I was aware that there would be a need for company witnesses.  I am very proud of the work that's been done, the extensive work, the efforts of all my colleagues over the years, and I felt some responsibility to represent that work. So I indicated that I would consider doing it.

Q.    who contacted you, do you remember?

A.  I don't remember who contacted me.

Q. Was it a lawyer from Womble Carlyle?

A.  I think probably, if I recall, I probably made it known to both my superiors

and lawyers that I would consider it, that I wanted to think about it carefully.

Q.  Is it something that you volunteered to do before anyone contacted you about it?

A. Yes. I had been part of earlier litigation that had gone on in different matters, and so I was aware that there was, from time to time, a need for it.  I was aware that some of the other colleagues in the department had time that was spent, and I also understood that it's something that my colleagues and myself do in addition to our other responsibilities, we are not relieved of any responsibilities.

So I felt, again, from the standpoint of the work that had been done over the years, from the standpoint of the burden being shared, so to speak, in the fact there are a number of cases, I, in essence, indicated that I would consider it.

Q. Did you talk to any of your colleagues about their work as witnesses in Engle cases before you volunteered?

A. Not about the details of it, but I

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

was aware that they provided testimony.

Q. Which ones of your colleagues did you talk to about this?

A. About the fact that they participated in litigation?

Q.  Yes.

A. Well, I was aware that Dr. Cook participated, I was aware that Dr. Figler participated.  I have been aware over the years of quite a number of different colleagues that have been part of litigation activities.

Q.  But Dr. Cook and Dr. Figler you were aware were specifically involved in the Engle cases?

A. Yes, I believe so.

Q. Any others specifically involved in the Engle cases?

A. Not at that point in time, but there have been others since then.

Q. Did Dr. Cook or Dr. Figler tell you, in essence, that we need more help testifying?

A. No, I think that it was clear that there was a lot of potential for many cases,

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

and I think it was just clear to me logically.

Q.  Did you have any conversation with anyone to the effect that maybe Dr. Cook and Dr. Figler are not doing the best job and we need someone better?

A. No.

Q.    So I think you testified in Reiss, Callaway and Hallgren, or you testified by deposition in Hallgren  not only by deposition, but also by trial, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is there anything, as you sit here today, about the testimony that you gave in any of those cases, either by deposition or trial, that you could think of that was incorrect or wrong in any way?

A. No.

Q. There is nothing about any of your testimony in any of those past cases that you want to take back or correct?

A. No.  I may express things differently in terms of the exact words, but no.

Q. Nothing wrong or inaccurate about

any of your past testimony?

A.  No.

Q. Before you testified in your first Engle case, what did you do to prepare?

A. I considered the opinions that I may offer, X considered my reliance list and the documents that I would rely upon in terms of forming my opinions, and so X spent time creating that list as well as reviewing those documents and had discussions, obviously, with counsel just to understand how the process worked, what was generally involved. X considered what may be part of the entire process and what types of questions X might be asked.

Q.  The reliance list that you created for that case, the first reliance list that you created, was that substantially similar to the reliance list that you submitted in the Hiott case?

A. Yes.

Q. Have there been some documents added?

A. X update my reliance list from time to time. There have been at least a few

23

articles added since the very first list was created, yes.

Q. Were those articles that had not yet come out when the first list had been created or were those articles that existed prior to that first list being created?

A. Probably both. I know at least some that hadn't appeared in the literature at that point in time. There may be some that appeared that X became aware of after X first created it.

Q.  is there anything on that first reliance list that has been removed and is no longer part of your reliance list?

A. No.

Q. Did you have help putting together that reliance list?

A.  I didn't have help putting it together in terms of deciding what X would rely upon.  I did have administrative help from the law firm in terms of creating the documents with the right numbering, Bates numbering or whatever and so on, providing the right documents in that way, so  creating the actual DVD that had the

24

electronic versions and so on.  So I had administrative help in that way, yes.

Q. Other than administrative help, did anyone suggest to you some documents that should go on your reliance list?

A. There were suggestions of ones to consider. The document are ones that I've  some are ones that I've written, some are ones that I've reviewed throughout the course of my career. And so there were ones suggested and when they were suggested, I reviewed them and considered if they were informing my opinions or not.

Q, Do you remember, as you sit here today, any of the documents that had been suggested to you?

A.  I don't know.

Q. Not one?

A.  No.

Q. Before you testified in your first case, either by deposition or by trial, did you go through meetings with lawyers to get ready?

A.  I had discussions with counsel, yes.

Q.  How much time did you spend discussing with counsel?

A.  Before the very first one?

Q. Yeah.

A.  I don't recall the exact number of hours, but I think in terms of that specific preparation, it would have been on the order of the same as for this one, probably on the order of 10 to 12 hours. Prior to preparing for that case, as I said, I prepared in general by considering my reliance list, reviewing all those documents, but that would have been before that particular case.

Q.  How much time did you spend putting together that first reliance list?

A.  I would spend several hours some weeks and no time other weeks. Probably did it over a three- to six-month period in terms of reviewing all the articles. There are quite a number of articles on my reliance list. It takes time to read through all of them and think through all of them.

So in terms of the total time, I don't know, I've never added it up. But some weeks, several hours in that week, perhaps

(212) 490-3430

to

even four to eight hours in that week, other weeks none. And that was probably during a three- to six-month period.

Q. So seven, eight hours a week over a three- to six-month period just reviewing your reliance materials and getting up to speed on what these cases are about?

A. That's  yeah, I would think that's ball park.

Q. As part of that process in that three- to six-month period seven, eight hours a week, did you meet with lawyers?

A.  I did at times, yes.

Q. How much time did you spend meeting with lawyers?

A. Oh, probably on the order of 10 or 20 percent of that time. The bulk of the time was spent creating my list, reviewing all of the documents. It may have been 25 percent. But not the majority of that time.

Q. So a couple hours a week for three to six months?

A. It wasn't each and every week, but perhaps on average, yes.

Q. During this time period when you

were meeting with lawyers, did you go through

mock deposition questions and answers?

A. I considered questions that I might

be asked, but no, no mock trials or

depositions.

Q. So they told you questions that you

might be asked at the depositions and you

considered the answers?

A. Oftentimes, I considered myself

what questions X might be asked, but there

were questions that also counsel suggested

might be asked.

Q.  How about in preparation for this

specific deposition, did you go through any

mock questions with counsel?

MR. KREINER:  Let me just, for the record, caution the witness not to reveal the substance of attorney-client communications.  I think he can generally answer the question.

THE WITNESS: Probably considered themes.  I don't recall right off specific questions, but there may have been some.

Q.  During any of these meetings, either when you were preparing for the first case or this case, did anyone suggest to you what your answers should or shouldn't be?

A. No.

Q. Are the opinions that you are giving in this case substantially similar to the opinions that you were prepared to give and did give in prior Engle cases?

A. Yes.

Q. Are there any new opinions that you have been asked to give in this case, the Hiott case, that you hadn't been asked to give in any prior case?

A.  No.

Again, when you say "asked," X wasn't asked to give particular opinions. I have expert opinions. They are summarized in the expert disclosure that was provided. So I wasn't asked to provide any specific opinions, but I do have the opinions that X expect, depending upon the questions, I would express.

Q.  So setting aside the word "asked," the opinions that you are prepared to give in

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

this case are substantially similar to the opinions that you were prepared to and did give in prior Engle cases?

A.  Yes.

Q.    Other than the work that you have already done in this case, do you plan to do any further work in this case before trial?

A.  I will prepare as needed for trial. I am always working in this area, so, I mean, in my day to day  I am always reading new scientific literature and so on, but it's not specifically for the trial per se. I'll continue to be a scientist between now and when this case would go to trial.

Q. Well, do you plan to look at any new materials that has not been listed on your reliance list or that you haven't produced today?

A. No.

Q. Do you anticipate that any of your opinions will change between now and the trial date?

A. Again, I don't anticipate that, but X am monitoring the literature every single day. There are new scientific articles being

put forward.  Depending upon what would come out in the scientific literature between now and the time that this case would go to trial, it's possible that my opinions could change.

Q. But barring any new scientific materials coming out between now and the day of trial, you don't plan on reviewing anything new?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. You listed some of the things that you read that were specific to this case. Did that include any of the medical records in this case?

A.  No, it didn't.

Q. Do you plan on looking at any of the medical records in the case?

A. No, I don't.

Q. Have you looked at any of the reports given by any other expert in this case?

A.  No.

Q. Do you plan on doing that?

A.  No.

Q. Do you plan on reading the

depositions of any of the other experts in this case?

A.  No.

Q. Okay. Let's take a look  your counsel has handed me a folder with some materials in it.

These are the materials that you brought with you today to the deposition?

A. Yes, they are.

Q. Is it fair to say that this is your case file in the Hiott case?

A. These are the documents that I looked at.  X wouldn't normally call it a case file.

Q. Are there any other documents in your possession that related to the Hiott case?

A. No.

Q. So there is nothing else in your office related to this case?

A. No.

Q. So the first document is the notice of deposition in this case, right?

A.  Yes.

Q. And have you marked this document

A.
	Yes.
	

Q.
	When was the last time this
	

document

A.

The next thing I see is a

A. That's correct, yes.

(Borgerding Exhibits 4 and 5 were

Q. The court reporter has marked as Exhibit 4, Plaintiff's Notice of Serving Second Amended/Consolidated Responses to Defendant R. J. Reynolds First Set of Interrogatories dated March 24, 2011. And as Exhibit 5, Plaintiff's Notice of Serving Amended/Consolidated Responses to Defendant R. J. Reynolds First Set of Interrogatories dated March 24, 2011. And both of these are in the Hiott case.  The caption says, "Pertains to Carolyn Hiott," etcetera. Exhibit 4 is dated July 26, 2011 and Exhibit 5 is dated June 13, 2011.  I am going to hand you both Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5.  (Handing.)

And can you identify  you don't have read the titles, but are those additional materials that were given to you by R. J. Reynolds' counsel as part of what you looked at to inform your opinions in this case?

A.  Yes, they were to provide just information about, again, Mrs. Hiott,

Mr. Hiott, Mr. Hiott's smoking history in terms of the brands of cigarettes and cause of death and so on.

Q. Why did you want to see his cause of death, did that inform any of your opinions in this case?

A. Just to understand the nature of the case and to understand about the case itself.

Q. And is it fair to say, though, that the cause of death doesn't really affect any of your opinions in this case?

A. I think that that's true, yes.

Q. Other than the brands that Mr. Hiott smoked, is there anything that you learned that was case specific that affected any of your opinions in this case?

A. No.

Q. I note that on Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5, there are a number of green tabs. Can you tell me what those green tabs are?

A. Those green tabs are the sections that I read through to understand, again, about Mr. Hiott and Mrs. Hiott, their  Mr. Hiott's son, Terrence, to understand when

Mr. Hiott was born, which brands he smoked and so on to learn some of the case specific facts.

Q.  By "case specific facts," again, is it fair to say that you mean what Mr. Hiott's brand history was?

A.  Yes.

Q. To the extent there is no green tab on a particular page, does that mean you didn't read that page?

A. That's correct, yes.

MR. VINIK: Let's go off the

record.

(Whereupon, a discussion was held

off the record.) BY MR. VINIK:

Q. I just want to note for the record, I am going to give you back Exhibit 4 and Exhibit 5, and why don't you just page through it and just tell us for the record which document you are looking at and which page has the green tabs on it.

So you're looking first at Exhibit 4?

A.  Looking first at Exhibit 4.

Q. And you have green tabs on which pages?

A.  The first green tab is on page 3 of 21. The next green tab is on page 4 of 21. The next green tab is on page 6 of 21. The next green tab is on page 7 of 21. The next green tab is on page 9 of 21. And the last green tab is on page 15 of 21.

Q. Before you go to the next document, I'm sorry about this, but does the location of the green tab on the page have any significance?

A. Generally, yes, the green tab is placed around the section that I was reading to understand something about, again, who the plaintiff was, what Mr. Hiott's brand history was, so that the specific parts of the page that I focused upon generally are by the green tab, unless there was more than one thing.

Q. For example, on page 6, I see the green tab is closest to the place on the page where it says, "Employer: United States Post Service."

Do you see that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is that the part of the page that you were looking at?

A. Yes, it informed me about Mr. Hiott's employment, that he was employed by the United States Postal Service.

Q. The fact that he was employed by the United States Postal Service, does that affect any of your opinions in this case in any way?

A. No, it doesn't.

Q. Was there anything else on this page that you were looking at specifically or is it just the post office employment where the green tab was marked?

A. As I recall, that was it, but  no, that was all  well, also that he  that his educational background was that he completed high school, so some of his educational background.

Q, Again, does that inform your opinions in any way or change your opinions, what his educational background was?

A. No.

is there anything in here other than his smoking brand history that informs your opinions in any way?

A. No.

Q. Let's just do the same thing with Exhibit 5, just tell me what pages the green tabs are on.

A. The first green tab is on page 3, the next is on page 4, the next is on page 6, the next is on page 7, the next is on page 9 and the last is page 12.

Q. And same question as before, is there anything in that document that informs your opinions in any way other than what you learned with regard to smoking brand history?

A. No.

MR. VINIK: Okay. Let's mark this

next.

(Borgerding Exhibit 6 was marked

Q. The court reporter has marked as Exhibit 6 a document which is entitled, "Defendant R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's Expert Disclosure." And I note that there is

a green tab on page 13 which has your name on it.  (Handing.)

Is that correct?

A.  That's correct, yes.

Q. And that's the only green tab that's on that document?

A.  Yes.

Q. And this is a document that you also produced today as coming out of your files?

A. Yes, this is a document that I reviewed. It's a document that's the Reynolds Tobacco Company expert disclosure. It includes my opinions in the section behind the green tab.

Q. Behind the green tab, there is a  on page 16, there is a section that starts, "Subject Matter of Expert Testimony." Is that the subject matter that you are prepared to give expert testimony on in this case?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is there anything else that's not listed in that section, Subject Matter of Expert Testimony, that you are prepared to give an opinion on?

A.  I am prepared to offer an opinion based upon the questions asked, and my opinions are based on my education, my 30 years and more of working for R. J.

Q,  The next document does not have any green tabs on it, right?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q.  It's entitled the "Third Amended Complaint, Pertains to Carolyn Hiott, as personal representative of the Estate of Kenneth Hiott," and this is dated October 18, 2011.

Is this a document that you reviewed as part of your work on this case?

A. It is, yes.

Q. The fact that there is no green tabs on that document, does that signify anything?

A.  It signifies that I read the document in its entirety.

place in the transcript that you read?

A.  Yes.

Q. What page is the green tab on?

A. It's on page 613.

Q. Is page 613 the only page of the deposition that you read?

A. I believe I read from page 613 through page 615.

Q. And is there anything in those pages, 613 to 615, that informs your opinions in this case?

A. Merely the facts about the amount of  the usage of cigarettes that Mr. Hiott had as far as how many packs per day.

Q.     I think you testified earlier that it was your understanding that he smoked a pack a day, right?

A. Yes.

Q, The fact that he smoked a pack a day or any other amount of cigarettes, does that inform your opinion in any way?

A. No.

Q. Your opinion be the same whether he smoked a half a pack, two packs, three packs, whatever?

A.  Yes.

Q. I am going to give you back Exhibit 2, which I think you testified was your reliance list, right?  (Handing.)

A. Yes.

Q. How many documents are on that list?

A.  There is about 700 documents.

Q.    Is the list numbered?

A.  It's not numbered sequentially, it has a column called, "Exhibit Number."

Q.  It's not numbered sequentially, so you don't know exactly how many documents are on the list?

A. I believe there is in excess of 700.

Q.  In general, are these reliance materials, the 700 documents on this list, things that you saw prior to being involved in the Engle cases?

A. There is a number of different types of documents. Some are documents that

I authored or co-authored.  Some are documents that I have seen throughout my career at Reynolds.  Some  in more recent years, some that I may have read towards the beginning of my career when I considered what was informing my opinions.  Some were documents that were also suggested as ones that may inform my opinions and I may have considered, and if I felt that it did inform my opinion, it would be present as well.

Q. The documents that were suggested that may inform your opinions, were those generally internal R. J. Reynolds documents or were those documents that were authored by people external to the company?

A.  I would expect some of both.

Q. Do you remember, sitting here today, any of the specific documents that were suggested to you as opposed to the ones that you were more familiar with before?

A.  I don't, no.

Q.    I am going to give you back what was marked as Exhibit 1, which is your CV, right?

Q.  Okay.  So you have a Ph.D. in chemistry, which you got in 1988, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.    And in 1980, I see you started at R. J. Reynolds as a junior research chemist, right?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q. So you started as a junior research chemist approximately eight years before you got your Ph.D.?

A. Yes.

Q. How old were you when you started at R. J. Reynolds?

A.  I was 24.

Q. Did Reynolds put you through school to get your Ph.D.?

A. Reynolds, after I joined the company, created an education program, so they talked to various universities about creating such a program, and I was one of the first individuals to participate in that program.  The company has had that ever since, so basically for about 30 years now, where employees have the opportunity to continue their education.  If they do well,

they have meet minimum standards as far as passing courses and so on, the company will reimburse the course expense.

Q.  So Reynolds paid for your expenses in getting your Ph.D.?

A. They reimbursed me for the costs of the courses, yes.

Q. And so you have been with Reynolds ever since 1980?

A. I have, yes.

Q. Let's turn to the next page of your CV.  I hope it's the next page on your copy. There is a section called, "1982-1984, Associate Research Chemist" at the top of the page.

A. Yes.

Q. And under that, it says, "Planned and executed investigations of tobacco and tobacco smoke."

Do you see that?

A. I do, yes.

Q.  Is that a pretty good description generally of what you have been doing with R. J. Reynolds really since 1980 to the present?

A.  That is  has been a focus in the earliest years in my career, especially in terms of developing analytical techniques to investigate the composition of tobacco and tobacco smoke, to develop and validate methods to quantitatively determine very small amounts of materials that may be in smoke. So develop and validate, for example, a method that measure billionths of a gram of a compound within smoke.

After many years of working in that type of research in general, I've had other roles as well.  I have worked in the area of, for example, developing, testing techniques that are in support of regulatory requirements.  I've developed programs to evaluate reduced risk tobacco products and provided science to government officials and other scientists and individuals in that regard.

So various types of things throughout my career, as far as chemistry. That's been a part of it. Currently I lead our clinical studies team, so that's one of my current areas of focus.

Q.  Let's try and narrow it down a little bit. I think I see that from really 1982 through 2001, you were really working on and focusing on investigations of tobacco and tobacco smoke; is that fair to say?

A. Tobacco and tobacco smoke have been part of it, but the focus of that work has been development and evaluation of reduced exposure and reduced risk products.  The development of testing approaches that were  will be required or were required by the government or state governments.

So there's been a regulatory focus, there's a product evaluation focus in terms of reduced risk products, and there's been a clinical studies focus.

Q. I see if you look at the next page of your CV, in 2001, there's a heading, title, "Senior Principal Scientist and Director."

Do you see that?

A. I do, yes.

Q. And under that heading, I see a reference to "potential reduced risk cigarettes."

A.  Yes.

Q. That's the first time I see that reference; is that right, 2001? I could be wrong.

A. In 1987 to 1991, on the previous page, where it says, "Senior Research Chemist," it indicates, "R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, Winston-Salem, North Carolina, directed efforts to chemically characterize new products in support of product development and claims substantiation."

And so these would be products that are products that have the potential to reduce exposure to toxicants, for example, and to reduce the risks of smoking.

Q. So it was really starting in 1987 when you started looking into that reduced risk exposure, reduced risk products issues?

A. My responsibilities at that time, yes, would have changed where I had responsibility for developing a chemical evaluation program to assess those products as compared to other products.

Q. What products were you looking at

assessing in 1987?

A.  That product was introduced in test market in the United States as Premier.

Q. And then the next time I see on your resume a reference to reduced risk products is 2001.

So did you work on Premier only from 1987 to some fixed period of time and then stopped working on reduced risk products?

A. Well, Premier had a finite period of time, but I should, just to be clear, in terms of the techniques that I've worked on throughout my career, even before the mid 1980's, these were methods and so on that relate to all tobacco products, all cigarettes, and so in terms of, for example, understanding the yields of particular compounds in smoke, for example, there is a class of compounds known as carbonyls.  I would have developed a method that was applied not only to a product like Premier, which is a tobacco heating product, but also to products that have general reduction techniques or other selective reduction

techniques.

Q.  Those would apply to conventional cigarettes, right?

A.  Yes.

Q. Premier, I would say, is not really a conventional cigarette, right?

A. Premier is a cigarette that would have only heated tobacco rather than burning it, so in that regard, it was a quite a different design than cigarettes that had come before that.

Q.  So setting aside efforts on conventional cigarettes, was Premier the only nonconventional cigarette product or nonconventional tobacco product that you worked on in the period 1987 to 1991?

A. That would have been a key focus of that time frame, tobacco heating technology in the Premier product. There would have been evaluation of other cigarette designs and other products that were being developed through the research and development process as well.

Q.  So from 1991 to 2001, when I next see reduced risk cigarettes on your resume or

on your CV, was there any work being done in nonconventional cigarettes that you were doing?

A. In  again, I'm sorry, the time frame was?

Q. Well, let's try and be as clear as possible. You have a reference from 1987 to 1991 of what you say was your work in Premier, Premier cigarettes, right, or Premier, the product?

A. Well, my CV is trying to give a general idea of the areas that I've worked in, but it doesn't try and capture all the different products or other different experiments and so on that were conducted.

Premier would have been a focus during that time frame. There have been quite a number of different products. Some are tobacco heating products, some are products that primarily heat but burn some tobacco, some are products that would have different blends and have a carbon filter.

So there have been a wide range of products that I've worked to evaluate in terms of understanding if different

technologies will reduce exposure and risks of smoking.  They're not all listed in terms of these sections of the CV.

Q. Between the period 1991 and 2001, were you working on any of these products that you just mentioned?

A. Yes.

Q. Which products were you working on in that time frame?

A. In that time frame, there would have been primarily effort on a product that primarily heated rather than burned, so this is the Eclipse cigarette. There would have been something that was a project termed "EW," which was a product with a low nitrogen blend and a carbon filter. There would have been others as well that don't come immediately to mind as I sit here.

Q. Did something change in 2001 with regard to the work you were doing that you added this reference to potential reduced risk cigarettes on your CV starting in 2001?

A. No, the CV was generated many years ago, I mean, as time went on, and it was just an effort to capture the general thrust of

the work at that time.  It wasn't intended to be all inclusive in terms of everything that X have done.

Q. Turning to the page to 2008 to the present, which on my copy is page 4.

A. Yes.

Q. Is that page 4 on your copy?

A. It is, yes.

Q. So tell me what you do today.

A. Today I work in the research and development department, in product integrity and I lead our clinical studies team.

Q.  Is the clinical studies team part of the research and development department?

A. Yes.

Q. And the product integrity team is also part of research and development?

A. Yes.

Q. Are those separate departments within research and development?

A. No, research and development is the department, product integrity would be one division or one part of the R and D, and the clinical studies team would be part of that.

Q.  So the clinical studies team is

part of the product integrity division?

A.  Yes.

Q. Are there any other divisions?

A. Yes.

Q. What are the other divisions of research and development?

A.  The other divisions, and we would call them probably functional areas rather than divisions, but would be cigarette product development, smokeless product development and the technical services area.

Q. Have you spent your entire career at Reynolds in the R and D department?

A.  I have, yes.

Q. Have you spent most of that time in the product integrity department or division of the research and development department?

A. We've had many different organizational structures throughout the time I've been an employee of R. J. Reynolds.  I have worked in something called the chemical division, I've worked in something called the analytical division, I've worked in the analytical chemistry division, I've worked in scientific and regulatory affairs.

So there's been various reorganizations over the years to try and align the R and D resources within the business focus.

Q,    Is there no longer a division in the R and D department called the chemical division?

A. There's not currently, no.

Q. And is there no longer a department called the analytical division?

A. No.

Q. And there is no longer a department called the scientific and regulatory affairs division?

A. No, product evaluation would include our stewardship team, so there is an area called product stewardship. There would also be an area called regulatory compliance.

Q. Product stewardship and regulatory compliance, are those subsets of product integrity?

A. Yes, they are all within product integrity.

A. The clinical studies team, and they are all part of that team, is responsible for our clinical studies program. So they would do a number of different things.  They generally would lead clinical studies in terms of being the sponsor representative to that process. Some of them would be involved in research to identify new biomarkers of exposure and biomarkers of potential harm. Some are focused on parts of the clinical study process that is bioanalytical analysis,

how samples are basically moved from the various locations to an appropriate laboratory for determination.  They would work on qualifying vendors, making sure that all of the work is conducted according to good laboratory practice and good clinical practice.

And so this would be the focus, it would be conducting clinical studies, conducting research around new biomarkers and facilitating the bioanalytical analysis.

Q. Are there any medical doctors on that clinical studies team?

A. No, there are no medical doctors that are part of the team, but each study that's conducted would have a principal investigator. The studies are conducted through contract research organizations and the principal investigator for any study would be an MD.

A. Somewhere between 180 and 200, yes.

Q. Has it changed significantly over the time that you have been at R. J. Reynolds?

A. Yes, it has.

Q. Was it higher or lower than it has been historically today?

A. That, of course, would depend upon the point of comparison, but during my career, it's been both smaller and larger than we currently are.

Q. What's the largest it's ever been?

A. I don't know the exact number, but probably, in terms of research and development, at least perhaps 6 to 800 people.

Q. When was it 6 to 800 people, what time frame was that?

A. That time frame would have been mid to late 1980's.

63

Q. Do you have an understanding of why it was so much larger in the mid to late 1980's?

A. One of the principal reasons was this was the time frame that we were working on developing the Premier cigarette, what became the Premier cigarette, and this was an effort unlike any other that I've been involved with in that there was all available resources put forward because we believed that we had a cigarette design that had the potential to reduce the risks of smoking, and we wanted to, as rapidly as possible, conduct the research necessary to evaluate that, and if appropriate, to put a product on the market.

Q. And this was when, in the early '80's, mid '80's?

A. That effort began as a small effort in terms of just the concepts and the fundamental research in the very early 1980's and went through the 1980's. The product was introduced into test market about 1988.

Q. And why was R. J. Reynolds trying to develop a Premier cigarette, what was the

(212) 490-3430

64

point of that project?

A.  The point of that project was to develop a cigarette that had simpler smoke chemistry, that had reduced biological activity, that produced or eliminated environmental tobacco smoke and that was acceptable to consumers.

Q. By "reduced biological activity," do you mean a cigarette that wouldn't cause, for example, lung cancer?

A. A cigarette that had the potential to reduce the risks, yes.

Q,  Reduce the risks of lung cancer?

A. Lung cancer and other diseases as well, yes.

Q. So it's fair to say that as early as the early 1980's, R. J. Reynolds was trying to create a new type of tobacco product that would not cause, or at least reduce the risk of getting lung cancer?

A. That didn't begin in 1980, but that was  the 1980*s were the focus on the technical approach of primarily heating tobacco rather than burning. But we, since the 1950's, had been focused on trying to

reduce the yields of smoke in terms of tar and nicotine yields, there has been extensive research to try and selectively remove compounds or reduce compounds that have been reported to be associated with the risks of smoking. And so in the 1980' s, the focus  a large focus was in the area of trying to achieve the end points or the goals I mentioned in my previous answer by primarily heating  I'm sorry, by only heating tobacco rather than burning it.

Q, Was this the first effort to try and come up with a product that was really different from conventional cigarettes in that the product would be heated and not burned?

A. The goal wasn't to make a cigarette different per se. The goal was to make a cigarette, as I indicated, that had reduced  a simpler smoke chemistry, reduced biological activity or reduced or eliminated environmental tobacco smoke.

But, no, as I indicated earlier, in terms of work that went on from the 1950's and for many years after that, there were

efforts to try and reduce generally the tar and nicotine yields from cigarettes and selective compounds that have been identified as being associated with the risks of smoking. That was the first time that the technology, the concept of how to design and create a cigarette that achieved some of those goals by only heating tobacco was addressed.

Q.  So that was the first time  I'm really trying to get to  is it fair to say that Premier was really not a conventional cigarette, I mean, in the sense that you didn't put it in your mouth and light it and it didn't burn, it was really a different technology than a conventional cigarette?

A. It was different as far as the design of the cigarette was quite different, but like other cigarettes, it was lit, it was puffed upon and smokers could inhale or not inhale. Most smokers do inhale. But the cigarette was lit, puffed, smokers exhaled a visible aerosol that looked like smoke, but the composition of that aerosol was much simpler.

Some of the ways in which Premier differed from other cigarettes is, as I've indicated in the earlier answers, it heated tobacco, it didn't burn it, and it also, because it didn't burn tobacco, it didn't change in length during the time that it was smoked, so it didn't become shorter. There was a highly refined carbon heating element in the tip of the cigarette that was lit, did burn to produce heat, but tobacco was not burned to produce heat, and there was not the incomplete combustion of tobacco that goes on with other cigarettes.

Q. Was this the first effort to create a product that heated tobacco and not burned it?

A. I don't know if it was the first effort to heat tobacco, but it was the first successful effort to produce a thermally generated aerosol that was quite simple in composition and that did that without burning any tobacco.

Q. Was it the first effort that you were involved in to heat tobacco rather than burning it and having a product that would do

that instead of burning?

A.  Yes, it was.

Q.  So prior to this effort, there was an effort to reduce risk in cigarettes that were actually burned like a conventional cigarette, right?

A.  Yes.

Q. And the reason R. J. Reynolds was doing that was to try and create a cigarette that either reduced or eliminated the risk of it causing lung cancer, right?

A. R. J. Reynolds pursued those various efforts based on a number of factors. There was a call from the public in general, from the medical community, from the Surgeon General to reduce tar and nicotine yields and to try and identify what may be driving biological activity in smoke and to try and reduce or eliminate it* It was the right thing to do, and so there were many efforts in that regard.

Q. And the reason why you were trying to reduce biological activity was to create a cigarette that didn't cause so much lung cancer?

A.  It was to address the call, as I said, again, from the public and from the medical community and others, but yes, to try and reduce the things that are associated with the risks of tobacco products.

Q. Including the risk of getting lung cancer?

A.  Yes.

Q. And that was an effort that began in the 1950's, I think you said?

Q. When was that taken off the market?

A.  It was taken off the market in 1989, I believe.

Q. How long was it on the market?

A. Just a matter of months.

Q. Is it fair to say that was not a successful product?

A. It was not a successful product, no. It was a technical success, but it was not a success from the standpoint of being a consumer acceptable product.

Q. Do you have an understanding why the consumers didn't accept the product?

A. Yes.

Q. What's your understanding?

A.  I believe that smokers expected a product that was very much like their usual brand at that time. And the Premier cigarette, while it was a cigarette that was lit and puffed on and smoke was exhaled, it was different in a number of ways. It was more difficult to light, it produced an odor that was different than other cigarettes, it tasted quite different, and also, it didn't provide some of the ritual or the common

things that smokers expected, such as burning down and tapping ashes and so on.

Q. And at that time, smokers could get conventional cigarettes, right?

A. Yes.

Q.    Do you have an understanding of how much nicotine was delivered to people who smoked Premier cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

Q. Was it the same amounts of nicotine that was delivered to people who smoked conventional cigarettes?

A. Yes, it would have been in the range of other cigarettes at that time.

Q. Let's turn back to your CV and go to the page starting "Publications."

A. Yes.

A. No.

Q. Have you ever studied addiction?

A. I am not an expert in the area of addiction.  I have read things related to addiction.

Q. Other than reading things related to addiction, have you ever participated in any studies while at R. J. Reynolds with regard to addiction?

A. I have participated in studies and led studies to understand the yields of tar and nicotine and other components from cigarettes. In terms of our clinical studies, all of our clinical studies would involve generally measuring exposures to nicotine, measuring exposures to other smoke components, biomarkers as a potential exposure and biomarkers as a potential harm. So nicotine has been part of all of that. The study wasn't  there hasn't been

a study that's specifically about addiction.

Q.  Other than measuring yields of nicotine, did you ever participate in any study that specifically studied the mechanisms of addiction, something like that? MR. KREINER: Objection to form. MR. VINIK: Let me get an answer

and then if I have to, I will restate

Q. Other than measuring the yields of nicotine, did you, yourself participate in any studies with regard to addiction?

A. No study that specifically  that the title was addiction, but, again, in terms of evaluating exposure to nicotine is part of all our clinical studies.

Q. Other than evaluating exposure to nicotine, were there any specific studies that R. J. Reynolds did with regard to addiction?

A. There has been research in the past

in terms of the biology of nicotine, there has been work in that general area, there's been behavioral research conducted by scientists in the past.

In terms of my participation directly, it's been around the areas of clinical studies as well as analytical chemistry.

Q. When you say scientists have studied these things, are you essentially, in your last answer, are you meaning it to say R. J. Reynolds' scientists 

A.  Yes.

Q.   or scientists in general?

A.  I'm sorry. Yes.

Q.  Is there someone at Reynolds whose job it was specifically to study addiction and the mechanism of addiction?

A. There's been a, in past years, a biobehavioral group, a group of scientists that focused on smoking behavior and in terms of the biology of nicotine and in terms of understanding the reasons people smoke and the role of nicotine in that. There have been people that have conducted such

research, yes.

Q. When was the first time such research was conducted at R. J. Reynolds?

A. I don't know the first time. But what I was just referring to would have been during the 1980's.

Q.    Early 1980's or late 1980's?

A. Throughout the '80's, probably mid 1980's.

Q. Starting in 1980, is it fair to say that R. J. Reynolds was studying the topic of addiction?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: Again, these studies

were not about addiction specifically,

they were about smoking behavior, about

the biology of nicotine, about the role

of nicotine within smoking. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. I think we will come back to that. In general, can you tell me what the opinions are that you intend to give in this case?

earlier, I would expect that they would also be consistent, as we've discussed in my earlier answers to your questions, with the earlier depositions, but there would be a number of different opinions. Those opinions would include, for example, that R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company maintains a state of the art research and development department, that Reynolds employs and contracts with highly qualified scientists and engineers and other technical personnel to conduct research and development, that Reynolds Tobacco has been a leader in the research and development of cigarettes, that we've been recognized for our work throughout the years to understand the chemical composition of tobacco and tobacco smoke, and Reynolds' scientists were the first to identify many of the constituents that are in tobacco and tobacco smoke.

My opinions would also include that one of the guiding principals at Reynolds for many decades was to reduce the tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes, that this came from  for a number of reasons, including a

call from consumers in the public health community to do so, that Reynolds responded by investigating and developing techniques and so on that would allow new cigarette designs that would reduce the tar and nicotine yields and that there were products developed that achieved that goal as well were consumer acceptable in many cases.

Reynolds, beyond that, has continued to work in a number of areas to try and reduce exposure to toxicants that may be present in cigarette smoke, they've investigated technologies such as the concept of heating tobacco rather than burning it, concepts such as selective reduction through filter designs, through the use of tobacco substitutes, through consideration of the ratio of tar-to-nicotine yields, and then all these have been done with the purpose of trying to produce consumer acceptable products that have the potential to reduce exposure to the compounds that have been reported to be associated with the risks of smoking.

Beyond that, I will offer a number

of opinions around  and some facts around our corporate websites and so on, and again, it's as summarized in the expert witness disclosure that was provided.

Q. I think you said earlier that you're prepared to give an opinion with regard to the brands that Kenneth Hiott smoked?

A.  Yes.

Q. What brands did Kenneth Hiott smoke, or what's your understanding?

A. My understanding is that he smoked Winston and Salem brands.

Q. Any other brands?

A.  No.

Q. Now, Winston and Salem brands that were smoked by Kenny Hiott, those are engineered cigarettes; is that right?

MR. KREINER: Objection to the

form.

THE WITNESS: I'm not sure what you

mean by "engineered," but they were

cigarettes that were designed to address

the desires of consumers, and as I

of tar and nicotine and compounds within

tar. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. Well, by "engineered" product, I mean it's not a product that  you don't grow tobacco, dry it, roll it into a leaf and that's a cigarette, right, it's something else?

A. I'm not sure exactly what the question means, but those cigarette were tobacco rolled in paper with filters, yes.

Q. You don't just take tobacco leaf out of the ground, harvest it, dry it and roll it up, other things are done to the cigarette, right?

A. The tobacco is harvested, it's cured, drying isn't the correct technical term, but the tobacco would be harvested, it would be cured, it would be blended and it would be rolled in paper with a filter added to it.

Q, Are those all the steps needed to manufacture a cigarette? Let's talk specifically about a Winston cigarette right now.

A.  In terms of the manufacturing of a cigarette, those are the general steps that would go on, yes, and harvesting, that is, growing and harvesting tobacco per se isn't part of the manufacturing process, that's done by the farmers. The farmers would also cure the tobacco.

When the tobacco is received, the tobacco generally would be aged, it would have the stem removed from the tobacco. And after aging, the tobacco would be available for blending into the tobacco blend. The blend would be rolled in paper with a filter added on the end.

As part of that process, some cigarettes may have materials such as humectants to keep the tobacco moist during the manufacturing process, they may also have some flavor materials added in terms of the overall taste signature.

But those would be the general steps of making a cigarette. The joining of the filter to the tobacco column would be done with tipping paper, but that's just fundamentally the manufacturing process.

Q. Well, some cigarettes are  something called expanded tobacco is used in some cigarettes, right?

A.  Yes.

Q. Was expanded tobacco used in Winstons at all?

A. Yes, after a particular point in time, expanded tobacco was part of the blend.

Q. So that's part of the blend process. So tell me about the blend process. What are the steps in the blend process?

A. In the blending process, the tobaccos that will be part of the final tobacco blend are combined to produce a uniform cigarette.  Smokers expect their cigarette to be consistent from one cigarette to the next, one day to the next, one year to the next for that matter. So since tobacco is a natural agronomic product, a natural plant product, the plants themselves are not consistent from one plant to the next. Part of the blending process is to blend to a uniform tobacco blend such that the product tastes the same year to year.

The tobaccos that are included in

the blend can be lamina, it can be, as you've just mentioned in your question, expanded tobacco, they can be reconstituted tobacco sheet. All of these are tobaccos that can be present as far as types of tobaccos.

Q. Let's talk about each one of those three things.

What's lamina?

A. Lamina would be the principal part of the tobacco leaf. It would not include the stem.  The mid rib.

Q, So the stem is removed to create the lamina?

A.  Yes.

Q. Is anything else done to create the lamina?

A. No, it's cut into pieces.

Q. And you also talked about expanded tobacco, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Tell me what expanded tobacco is.

A. Expanded tobacco is tobacco in which the tobacco is exposed to a liquid. It absorbs that liquid. The tobacco is then heated very rapidly, and this causes the

(212) 279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

83

tobacco to expand, to puff up, if you will, somewhat similar to the concept of you start, for example, with popcorn seeds and you create a puffed piece of popcorn before it's consumed. And so expanded tobacco is tobacco that has been puffed up. As such, there's less tobacco required to produce the tobacco column in the cigarette, and the result of that, when the cigarette is smoked, is that the yields of tar and nicotine and so on are reduced.

Q. What liquid is used to puff up the tobacco?

A. Currently, carbon dioxide.

Q. What liquids were used historically for Winstons?

A. Historically, freon 11.

Q. What about for Salems, same thing?

A. Yes.

Q. Are any other liquids used for either Winstons or Salems historically or currently?

A. No.

Q.    What is reconstituted tobacco sheet?

pgNbr=83
84

A. Reconstituted tobacco sheet is a process by which tobacco that  other than the lamina are combined to create a tobacco sheet material, and so in that process, the tobacco is basically extracted with water, the remaining pulp materials are degraded* A tobacco sheet, much like a paper sheet, is created, extracted materials are reapplied and then it's cut for use in the blend.

Q. So that's the stems, when you say everything other than the lamina?

A. It could be some lamina, it could be stems, it could be dust, it could be various materials that are available beyond the main lamina.

Q.    You mentioned extracted materials being reapplied. Can you tell me about that?

A. Yes, as part of the process, the water soluble materials are removed. This allows the sheet to be formed after degrading the pulp-type material. When it's reapplied, the starting materials are reapplied, there is some loss, but generally, it would be then a tobacco sheet.

Q. What are the water soluble

(212) 279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY

www.veritext.com        (212) 490-3430

pgNbr=84
85

materials that are taken out and then reapplied?

A. There are a range of different materials there. Anything that would be in tobacco that's water soluble, so quite a number of different compounds.

Q.  Is one of those things nicotine?

A.  Yes.

Q. So the nicotine is taken out of the tobacco during the process of creating the sheet and then put back in?

A. As part of that mixture of all those water solubles, yes.

Q.  Is the exact same amount of water soluble materials that are taken out, the exact same amount is put back in?

A. No, there's some lost during the process.

Q. Was there ever a time when more of any material were put in?

A. No.

Q. And that goes throughout the entire 1950's to today?

A. Yes.

Q. What's the purpose of using

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424       www.veritext.com        (212) 490-3430

pgNbr=85
86

reconstituted tobacco sheet?

A.  There two primary reasons or two purposes.  One is from an economic standpoint, it makes complete use of the tobacco. The other is that it actually is a tool to reduce the tar and nicotine yields of cigarettes.

Q. How does it reduce the tar and nicotine yield of cigarettes using reconstituted tobacco sheet?

A. It's just the nature of that material that was determined through the course of research and development that it would reduce yields, and so it doesn't produce the same amounts of tar and the same amounts of nicotine as the other parts of the blend may. And so cigarettes that have higher amounts of reconstituted tobacco produce lower yields of those materials.

Q. These questions that I have been asking with regard to the manufacture of cigarettes in general, they would apply both to Winston and Salem?

A. Yes.

Q. And it would apply throughout the

A. Alan Rodgman was a scientist who worked at Reynolds for many years. He held a number of different positions. But he worked throughout his career to understand the composition of tobacco and tobacco smoke. He eventually, towards the latter parts of his career, had management responsibilities, and so at one point in time, he was a director of research.

Q. Is that your current title, director of research, or a director?

A. I'm a senior director of R and D, yes.

Q. Senior director.

At the time in 1983, was he director, Alan Rodgman?

A. In 1983, I believe that he would have been, yes.

Q. Who was G.R. Di Marco in 1983?

A.  Dr. Di Marco in 1983 would have been the head of R and D, vice president of R and D.

Q. So Alan Rodgman was reporting to the head of R and D, would be the equivalent today of Mr. Herco?

A. The head of R and D today is Mr. Herco, yes.

Q. But you don't report directly to the head of R and D, you report to Dr. Cook, right?

A. That's correct, yes.

Q.    The fact that Alan Rodgman is writing to this memo to the head of R and D, does that indicate to you that he's reporting directly to Mr. DiMarco?

A.  I believe he was reporting to Dr. Di Marco at that time, yes.

Q.  So he was really the equivalent of what Dr. Cook would be today in R and D, right?

A.  In that regard, yes.

Q.  In the second paragraph, it states, "In late 1977, marketing became concerned because the Winston was losing market share versus the Marlboro 85 and more and more consumers described the Winston as harsh and irritating."

Did I read that right?

A. Yes.

Q. The next paragraph says, "In response to the 1977 concern, a massive Winston improvement program was mounted in R and D in early 1978."

Did I read that right?

A. Yes.

Q. So RJR was concerned that Winston was losing market share versus the Marlboro in the late '70's, mid to late '70's?

A. Yes.

Q. And RJR was concerned that Winston was being described as harsh and irritating compared to Marlboro in the mid to late '70's?

A. That's what Mr. Rodgman's opinion was, yes.

the time based on your understanding?
	

A.  I believe so, yes.
	

Q. And in response to these concerns
	

that RJR had, a Winston improvement program
	

was undertaken in the mid to late '70's,
	

right?
	

A. Yes.
	

Q. And that improvement program was

A. Yes.
	

Q. And those projects are bullet

Q. And these are the projects that
	

were undertaken at RJR at that time in the

right?
	

A.  Yes.
	

Q. One of the problems they were
	

trying to solve was that the Winston was seen
	

as harsh and irritating, right?
	

A. Yes.
	

Q. So they wanted to make it less
	

harsh and irritating?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So in the mid to late '70's, they made changes to the Winston to make it less harsh and irritating?

A. Yes.

Q.    And when a cigarette is made less harsh and irritating, it's easier to inhale, right?

A. It would have different sensory characteristics in that consumers would report it to be less harsh and irritating. As far as cigarette smoke aerosols, all cigarette smoke aerosols were inhalable. I don't know that it makes it any less inhalable.

Q. If a cigarette is made less harsh and irritating, you don't think it's easier to inhale more deeply?

A. Not necessarily, no.

Q. Is that something that you studied?

A. I am aware of literature that shows for all cigarettes, that the size of the aerosol is similar and is inhalable.  I think this is more of a sensory characteristic, a reported perception of the smoke.

Q. Are you aware of studies that say when the sensory perception of the smoke is less harsh and less irritating, that people who smoke that are not able to inhale the smoke more deeply?

A. I'm aware that, for example, with a tobacco product such as a cigar, that cigars are not typically inhaled, although I believe a fraction of cigar smokers may inhale.

In the case of cigarettes, while it's my understanding that most cigarette smokers would inhale generally, that some cigarette smokers don't inhale and some smokers may inhale for some puffs and not others. It's a behavior and it's something that depends upon the individual and their behavior at that point in time.  I think for most cigarettes, they're lit, they're puffed, the smoker inhales and then exhales. But not for all.

Q. Are you aware of any studies that say that when a cigarette is made less harsh and irritating, that the cigarette smokers cannot inhale more deeply?

A.  I'm sorry, can you ask it again?

Q.  Let's ask the converse.  Are you aware of any studies at R. J. Reynolds studying whether or not cigarette smokers could inhale more deeply when the cigarette is made less harsh and irritating?

A. No.

Q. Are you aware of any studies done at R. J. Reynolds that showed that cigarette smokers could not inhale more deeply when the cigarette is made less harsh and irritating?

A. No.

Q.    Are you aware of any studies studying the propensity of cigarette smokers to inhale more deeply or less deeply when the cigarette is changed to become less harsh and irritating?

A. I am aware of a number of different things. One thing I am aware of is that in our studies, in terms of the various exposure measures, that some people don't inhale. And in some instances, the smoker may realize that they are not an inhaler, in other instances, they may not. And so from our studies that have been conducted, for example, looking at exposure to carbon

monoxide, it's very clear that if you take a group of smokers all smoking the same cigarette, that some are inhalers and at times, others are not. It's not a matter of the cigarette, it's a matter of the individual and their behavior.

Q. Most cigarette smokers inhale, though, right?

A. Most cigarette smokers light the cigarette, puff and inhale most puffs and then exhale.

Q. And it's kind of like the vast majority of cigarette smokers that smoke cigarettes inhale, right?

A. I would think that most do, yes. Q. Did R. J. Reynolds ever study what the effect on the inhalations, how deeply the inhalations were when a cigarette is made less harsh and less irritating?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: In terms of the types of studies that have been done, there have been studies done that have considered the size of aerosol.  I think that our general view as a group of

scientists would be that the smoke from

all the cigarettes that we've studied

would be inhalable. BY MR, VINIK:

Q. That's not my question.

My question is whether or not R. J. Reynolds ever studied how making a cigarette less harsh and irritating affects or doesn't affect how deeply cigarette smokers inhale cigarette smoke?

A. Not to my knowledge, no.

Q. But you said earlier that you didn't think making a cigarette less harsh and less irritating enabled someone to inhale more deeply, right?

A. Not necessarily, no. I think that behavior is dependent upon the person, and that person even smoking their usual brand may vary that behavior to where they inhale differently from puff to puff or cigarette to cigarette.

Q. So how do you come to that conclusion that making a cigarette less harsh and less irritating doesn't affect inhalation behavior if it hasn't been studied by R. J.

Reynolds?

A. Again, I think the question that you're asking is suggesting to me that everyone would do something in a particular way, and what I am trying to communicate to you in my answer is that much like puffing, inhalation is a behavior and it's variable, it's variable for an individual, even if they were smoking the same cigarette, and it's definitely variable from one individual to the next. So how someone inhales and the range of ways in which they inhale is something that's driven by that individual, not by the product as such. I think that the things that we were discussing in the earlier question and answer are around the sensory perceptions and how the smoker would describe the smoke.

Q. So the harshness of the cigarette has absolutely nothing to do with the ability of someone who is smoking a cigarette to inhale deeply?

A. I think in the extreme, something that's very harsh, maybe something that they don't even really want to puff on, for

example, that it may also effect if they choose to smoke something, so again  and to inhale. With cigars, cigars are something that some would probably suggest have a range of harshness or lack of harshness, and yet cigars are not generally inhaled.

Q. Moving on in the document, the bullet pointed items on the next two pages are the things that R. J. Reynolds did or outlined the things that R. J. Reynolds did in order to improve the Winston in the mid to late '70's, right?

A. They were all areas that there were some study or some research conducted, yes.

Q. And the Winston was actually changed in the mid to late '70's in response to some of these studies, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And one of the things that R. J, did was change the smoke pH of the Winston, right?

A.  I don't know that the smoke pH changed as such. What I do know is that the types of things being described here were tests that were available at that time and

that they were used to characterize one product versus another.  The type of characterization that was done was about the product, how one product relates to another in terms of those parameters. What we know today is that these, for example, the values that are being cited in this document around smoke pH don't have any particular meaning relative to what goes on when a cigarette is smoked. So, again, how a cigarette is smoked, how that smoke is collected for testing purposes and the manner of testing will produce various types of pH values. And in general, for example, I noted in this document, one of the things that's put forward is that there is a difference in smoke pH that occurs for higher yielding, higher tar and nicotine yielding cigarettes than lower tar and nicotine yielding cigarettes. This is a difference that would not exist under smoking conditions that are more typical of the range of ways in which people smoke cigarettes.

Q.    Let's take a look at the second page of the document. The second bullet

point says, "The optimum nicotine delivery for the Winston at T/N"  T/N is tar and nicotine?

A. Tar-and-nicotine ratio, yes.

Q.  "At T/N equals 16 in terms of consumer response was found to be 1.0 to 1.08 milligrams, not the 1.25 to 1.35 milligrams per cigarette delivery for the 1977, 1978 Winston 85."

Did I read that right?

A. Yes.

Q. So R. J. Reynolds was looking at the optimum nicotine delivery for the Winston at that time, right?

A. In terms of the product, trying to understand what product is most acceptable, this document is indicating they were looking at, based on the testing parameters that were available at that time, these type of values. But, again, these are values in terms of looking at how the smoke is balanced, looking at the composition of the product and they are values that are conducted under machine testing conditions.

It's not suggesting a yield to the

smoker, it's suggesting a product characteristic.

Q. How did they know what the optimum nicotine delivery yield to the smoker was?

A.  I am assuming in terms of the focus of this memorandum, in terms of harshness and so on, it's about balancing the smoke, the tar and the nicotine. Nicotine is part of the taste, nicotine can contribute to perceptions of harshness and so on. Tar, of course, is something that contains many of the flavorful compounds, in addition to any taste that nicotine provides/ so it's part of providing a sensory experience, a taste that's balanced in a preferred way in terms of the consumer. But these are all attributes of products themselves.

Q. What do you mean they were attributes of the product themselves?

A. They're things that are being determined under standard testing conditions, and so they allow one product configuration to be compared to another product configuration in terms of a particular parameter under a controlled test.

Q. And the parameters under those controlled tests for the Winston were changed in the mid to late '70's, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.    And one of the parameters was the amount of nicotine that was delivered under these controlled tests, right?

A. That were delivered in terms of the test itself, right.

Q. A little further down, the fifth bullet point, it says, "The mildness/smoothness of the Winston could be improved by incorporation of 67A into the blend."

Did I read that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What is G7A?

A. G7A was a particular type of sheet tobacco. In this case, it was an ammoniated sheet, so it's one that was focused on producing flavorful compounds during the process of creating the sheet.

Q. What's an ammoniated sheet?

A. Again, one that would be exposed to an ammonia compound and as part of that,

(212) 490-3430

105

there would be a reaction chemistry that would go on and produce flavorful compounds, such as pyrazines and pyridines.

Q. So adding ammonia to the blend changes the harshness of the cigarette?

A.  It changes  it can change the taste characteristics, not in that there's ammonia there, but as far as during the preparation or during the manufacture of the tobacco sheet, it can cause reaction chemistry to occur, which will produce flavorful compounds, again, when smoking.

Q.  If you read just under that sentence that I read before, it says, "Incorporation of ammoniated tobacco materials into a blend usually, but not always, increases smoke pH, decreases harshness/irritancy by reducing levels of aldehydes, ketones, acids, et cetera in the smoke."

Did I read that right?

Do you see where I just read?

A. Which bullet number?

Q.  It's the fifth bullet point, the indented paragraph.  It's starting with

"incorporation."

A.  Yes.

Q.  So do you agree that incorporation of ammoniated tobacco generally decreases harshness or irritancy?

A. Yes.

Q. And it can increase smoke pH?

A. Under the conditions of the test, yes.

Q. So the reason why R. J. Reynolds added ammonia or ammoniated tobacco to the Winstons in the mid to late '70's was to decrease harshness?

MR. KREINER: Objection to the

form. BY MR. VINIK:

Q.  Is that correct?

A. These efforts in general were to produce a product that was more consumer acceptable. Part of that was, yes, the concepts of harshness*

Q. Let me just restate those questions because of the objection.

In the mid to late '70's, RJR added ammoniated tobacco to the Winstons, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And the reason why they added the ammoniated tobacco to the Winstons was to  one of the reasons was to decrease harshness, right?

A. Yes.

Q. And did the addition of ammoniated tobacco to the Winstons also increase tobacco pH?

A. Under the conditions of the test, it did. Under a condition of testing more representative of the ways in which people smoked, I don't expect that it would, no.

Q. And what's the reason for that?

A.  Smoke pH is something that's a concept, it's actually something that in principal would be in solution, an acquiesce solution rather than in a smoke aerosol, and the smoke pH changes as a function of how the cigarette is puffed, is something that we've learned. The differences, as I indicated in an earlier answer, that were eluded to in this document for cigarettes that had different yields tend to collapse and be of a single value when you look under more

intensive regimens which would be more representative of the ways in which people smoke.  It's driven in part by the amount of water in the smoke, it's just the nature of the way that the smoke is formed.

Q. if you add ammoniated tobacco to a smoke which increases the pH under the controlled conditions of the test, wouldn't that indicate to you that compared to a different cigarette that had a lower pH, the person smoking that changed pH cigarette would get higher pH into his smoking than someone who's smoking the lower pH cigarette?

A. No.

Q. Has R. J. Reynolds studied that?

A. R. J. Reynolds has studied that in a variety of ways, and also, R. J. Reynolds  and I personally am aware of literature in that regard that's been published in recent years, and some of the key aspects of it are that smoke pH's are a defined quantity, it's something that would depend upon the testing conditions. So, for example, at times smoke pH values have been reported that represent a measurement of

(212) 279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212)   490-3430

ro en

109

whole smoke, other times they represent a measurement of just the particulate phase of smoke, and at various times, based on different machine puffing regimens. What's clear is that how a cigarette is smoked has a significant effect as far as that measured value, and that under the ways in which people smoke typically, there is very little difference, if any, in such a value for a wide range of cigarettes.

Contrasting with that, under the conditions of testing that were applied here under standard  what was then called the Federal Trade Commission testing regimen, there are differences that are observed. These are reflective of differences in the composition of the product, but they are not necessarily representative or indicative of what a smoker would experience.

Q. But a smoker would experience less harshness with ammoniated tobacco in general?

A.  It's quite possible, yes.

Q.  Is it generally the fact that the larger volume of puff will increase the pH of the resulting smoke?

A. No, it would tend to decrease it.

Q.  There is some handwriting on this document on the left side of the second page. Do you see that handwriting?

A.  I do.

Q. That's not your handwriting, is it?

A.  It's not, no.

Q. This was on the document when you looked at it?

A.  Yes.

Q. Do you have any idea whose handwriting that is?

A.  It appears that it's possibly two different individuals. The handwriting isn't necessarily consistent from the top part to the bottom part.

Q. Do you recognize it?

A. I don't recognize it, no.

Q. You don't have any understanding whose that is, do you?

point how to improve the Winstons even further, over and above the improvements that were made in the mid to late '70's, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Were changes made to the Winston, after this memorandum to improve the Winston?

A. Yes.

Q. Why don't we go back to time to the 50's up through today and tell me what your understanding is of how the Winston was changed and modified over that period of time and why those changes were made. Can we do that?

A.  Yes.  When Winston was first introduced in 1954, the Winston cigarette would have consisted of about a gram of tobacco. It would have been a filtered cigarette. In fact, perhaps the first successful filtered cigarette. It would have included reconstituted tobacco in the blend as well as would have been a so-called typical American blend of tobacco. And it would have yielded on the order of 38 milligrams of tar per cigarette under the standard FTC testing conditions, probably on

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424       www.veritext.com        (212) 490-3430

ropgNbr=111
112

the order of three milligrams of nicotine under those testing conditions.

There were a number of changes to Winston between that point in time and now. Some of those would have included, for example, the incorporation of faster burning cigarette paper, the incorporation of improved filter designs, the incorporation of high porosity paper, the incorporation of a reduced cigarette circumference, the incorporation of expanded tobacco and the incorporation of filter ventilation.

In all of those instances, the changes that I have just described generally reduced the tar and nicotine yields of the cigarette to where at the end of the process, the changes that I just described, the cigarette probably would have yielded about 60 percent less tar and nicotine than it did when it was first introduced in 1954. And the changes that I just indicated, with the exception of filter ventilation, would have all occurred by 1970, with the bulk of those occurring by 1960.

In addition, the Winston cigarette

(212) 279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

ropgNbr=112
113

would have contained humectant to help process the tobacco and flavoring material, flavor additives that would help give it a particular taste signature.

The current Winston cigarette, that was a further change, that would have been in the mid 1980's, and currently, the Winston cigarette does not contain any tobacco additives, so it does not contain any humectants or flavoring materials other than the blend of tobacco.

Q.    When did that change occur; the 1980's?

A. The mid '80's. Yes.

Q. Go ahead.

A.  In terms of during that time course, there would have been various things also to just address consumer wants around taste, but they would have been relatively minor compared to these fundamental changes in the design.

Q. We've seen in the last document that there seemed to be a specific effort in the mid to late '70's and then another effort in the earlier '80's to make changes, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is that how it generally happened with the Winston cigarette, were the changes incremental slowly over time, they were constantly changing and tinkering, or was it more of this effort every couple of years, that we have to study it and make changes?

A. The changes were for a variety of reasons. Some of the changes that I just described in my previous answer were part of the guiding principal of producing consumer acceptable cigarettes that reduced the tar and nicotine yields of the cigarettes. So many of those produced a cigarette with lower yields for the cigarette.

In terms of some of the others, they were around consumer preferences, taste perception, taste signature. So it would be those two general areas.

Q.    Well, my question is more towards the efforts, when the efforts happened. Did they happen sort of punctuated, every five years there would be massive changes made, or was it just slowly over time?

A. There was not a schedule, but

again, some of the technologies, the incorporation of the technologies that I described in my earlier answer would have been very distinct points in the development process and that they would have fundamentally changed the tar and nicotine yields. So the overall yields of the products would have changed. Other times the yields of the products may have remained constant in the some of those latter years, but the changes were around the taste itself.

So there wasn't a schedule per se, it was dependent upon the technologies that became available and incorporating those with the goal of reducing the tar and nicotine yields, and then also around consumer perception around how they perceived the taste of the product compared to other competitive products.

Q. So they weren't just trying to reduce the tar and nicotine/ they were trying to make a product that would sell better than, say, the Marlboro?

A. Well, it had to be a consumer acceptable product, and yes, we were

competing with others in the market place.

Q. They were trying to increase sales compared to the competitor Marlboro?

A. Yes. We want individuals that choose to smoke to consider our products.

Q. If I asked you the same questions with regard to Salem, would the answers be basically the same?

A. Generally the same.  Salem, of course, is a mentholated product, so it contains menthol in the tobacco blend. So Salem is not tobacco additive free, it contains menthol and other flavors.

Q.  Does menthol make the cigarette less harsh?

A. Menthol adds a particular taste characteristic, it makes it taste mentholated.  I don't know that it would be more or less harsh.

Q. Does menthol make it easier to inhale the cigarette?

A. I don't believe so, no.

Q. Are you aware of any studies that RJR did to study whether or not menthol made it easier or less easy to inhale a

mentholated cigarette?

A. No, I am not.

Q. Did menthol make the cigarette seem less irritating?

A. Menthol provided a taste that menthol smokers preferred. I don't know that it made it any more or less irritating, it provided that particular taste signature. One thing that's interesting is that most  to my understanding, most menthol cigarette smokers tend to prefer menthol and non-menthol smokers prefer non-menthol, and Mr. Hiott was one that liked to smoke both.

Q. You mentioned earlier vent holes with regard to Winston.

Did Salem have vent holes?

A. Yes.

Q. Were vent holes put in Salem around the same period of time that they were put in Winston?

A. Yes.

Q. And that was  did you say about

1960?

A. No, the filter ventilation for

Winston and Salem would have been about 1980.

Q.  Prior to 1980, there was no ventilation in the filters for Winston or Salem?

A. That's correct.

Q.    Were the Winston and Salem vent holes located in the same place for each of the cigarettes or were they placed differently?

A. X don't have the exact specification in mind. I think they would have been very similar, they may not have been exactly in the same place.

Q. Where were the Winston vent holes?

A. Again, just beyond typically where someone would hold the cigarette/ so I don't recall the exact number of millimeters, but several millimeters from the mouth end of the cigarette.

Q.  Several millimeters?

A. Yes.

Q. More than three?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you understand the term "compensation" as it relates to smoking?

ropgNbr=118
119

A. I do, yes.

Q. What's your understanding of the term "compensation"?

A. My understanding of the term "compensation" is generally it would refer to how someone's exposure when they're smoking different cigarettes compares to the machine generated yields of those cigarettes.

Q. So "compensation" in your view is the topic of tar and nicotine yields that a person gets as compared to machine measured tar and nicotine yields?

A. Much of the research is around cigarettes of different designs, and so, for example, if a smoker was switched from their usual brand to a cigarette that had lower machine yields of tar and nicotine, the question would be do they experience the same reduction and exposure when they switch from their usual brand to that cigarette as the machine would see under some specified testing condition?

Q. I see.

And is it your understanding that generally smokers will compensate and get

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

similar tar and nicotine yields when they are smoking a lower tar and nicotine yield in a machine measured cigarette as compared to a higher tar and nicotine yield machine measured cigarette?

A. I apologize, I started thinking about the answer to the first question.  I want to hear the question again.

Q. Is it your understanding that smokers will get the same tar and nicotine yield from their smoking that they want whether they are smoking a low machine measured tar and nicotine yield cigarette or a high machine measured tar and nicotine yield cigarette?

A. No, it's not.

Q. So you have a different opinion in this regard than, say, the Surgeon General of the United States?

MR. KREINER: Objection to the

form. BY MR. VINIK:

Q.  Is that right?

A. I would have to understand exactly what opinion you are referring to, but the

my views would be that, first of all, people smoke in a wide range of ways, that a smoker smoking their usual brand of cigarette will not yield necessarily the same amount of smoke from the cigarette one cigarette to the next or necessarily one day to the next. The yield of smoke from the cigarette is dependent upon their behavior. Some days they may take a more intensive puff, they may smoke the cigarette more rapidly, at other times more leisurely, may take smaller puffs or whatever behaviors they end up applying. And so one of the misconceptions that's gone on in these types of discussions is that a smoker smoking their usual brand gets a fixed amount of exposure to the smoke. That's variable available unto itself.

The other things that bear on the question are that, as was declared by the Federal Trade Commission in 1967, the standard testing method that existed for many years wasn't intended to indicate what any smoker would get or what any smoker's behavior would be, and so comparisons to that had their own questions.

122

But ultimately, all of the data that I am aware of suggests that cigarettes that yield lower amounts of tar and nicotine by machine tests, especially those that yield the lowest amounts, that when you look at smokers smoking either their usual brand or being switched to them are exposed to reduced amounts of tar and nicotine.

Q. That's a different opinion than what the opinion is of the Surgeon General of the United States, right?

MR. KREINER: Object to the form. THE WITNESS: Again, I'm not sure

which specific opinion you're referring

to. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. The opinion that you just stated in your prior answer.

A. I don't know that the Surgeon General has ever expressed the various things that I've just said as such.

Q. Do you have an understanding of what the opinion of the Surgeon General of the United States is with regard to compensation?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS: I believe generally the Surgeon General would suggest that people do compensate, and I don't know, as I sit here, if the Surgeon General would suggest that that compensation is complete. It's possible that the Surgeon General would.

It's my view compensation, as it was defined in the earlier answer that I provided, in terms of change relative to a machine change is incomplete and that there is a reduction in the exposure that a smoker experiences if they move from a high yielding cigarette to a very low yielding cigarette. BY MR. VINIK:

Q.  So if I understand your answer right, it's your view that compensation occurs, but it's not complete compensation? A. Compensation as defined by sort of the ratio that I was describing earlier, the change in what a smoker experiences versus the change of a machine condition.

Q. I just want to be sure I understand

your testimony. Your testimony is that when the tar and nicotine of a cigarette is lowered on a machine measured level, that the smoker will compensate to some degree, but it will not be complete compensation; is that right?

A. My testimony is that when a smoker switches from their usual brand to a lower yielding cigarette, their general behavior, and it will be a range of behaviors, when smoking the lower yielding cigarette may change. They don't have the same taste, the same flavor, the same amount of smoke. They may smoke the cigarettes more intensely in terms of a larger puff or more frequently, but in terms of switching from the high yielding cigarettes to the lowest yielding cigarettes, their exposure would be reduced, not in a direct proportion, that is, on a one-to-one basis compared to the standard FTC machine condition.

Q. I see.

Would you agree that one of the compensation behaviors that a cigarette smoker can engage in is covering up the vent

holes with their fingers or their lips?

A. It's my understanding that some smokers block some of the vent holes some of the time with either their lips or their fingers.

Q. And when did R. J. Reynolds first become aware of that particular compensation behavior?

A. I don't know the first time or that there was a single time. There have been quite a number of studies conducted over many years.  I don't know the exact date.

Q. Did R. J. Reynolds conduct those studies or were those studies conducted by others?

A. Reynolds has conducted some studies to understand the potential for vent blocking.

Q. What's the first study that you can remember that R. J. Reynolds did on vent blocking?

A. I don't have the exact date in mind, but one from the mid 1980's comes to mind.

Q. Mid 1980's?

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

enpgNbr=125

Was there any studies prior to that that R. J. Reynolds did with regard vent blocking?

A. None that come immediately to mind, but I need to refresh my recollection.

Q. And was that a study that was done by R. J. Reynolds in house or was that something that was contracted out?

A. There have been studies conducted in house, there have been studies conducted by others, scientists at Reynolds have published literature in this regard summarizing all of this work.

Q.  I'm talking about the first one that you remember.

A. The one that I recall in the mid '80's was conducted in house. It would have looked at staining patterns on the filter.

Q. Was that study published?

A.  X believe that it would have been published both as  I don't recall if it was published as an original article, but it would have been published in a review of all of that work.

Q.    You think that was published in the

mid *80's?

A. I don't have the exact date in mind.

Q. Well, the study you remember is from the mid '80's. Was it published in the '90's?

A. It's possible that it was late '80's into the '90's.

Q. Let's change gears for a second and talk about Viceroy cigarettes. Is Viceroy cigarettes something you are familiar with?

A.  I am familiar with Viceroy being a brand of cigarettes and so on. I've always been an employee of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and Viceroy hasn't been a Reynolds brand historically.

Q. When did Viceroy become a Reynolds brand?

A. I believe Viceroy was originally an American Tobacco brand, I could be wrong in that regard, and so it would have become part of Reynolds upon merger in 2004.

Q. Have you looked into the history of the Viceroy brand at all as part of the work that you are doing in this Hiott case?

A.  I have not, no.

Q.  Just generally as a tobacco company guy, do you have an understanding of whether or not the Viceroy had a different kind of filter than Winston or Salem?

A. As I sit here, X don't know the details of the filter. I would expect that any filtered versions would have been the same general types of filters.

Q. At one point, the Viceroy was advertised as the thinking man cigarette. Do you recall that in any way?

A.  I am not familiar with that, no.

Q. One of the things that you talked about when you were talking about the changes in the Winston over time, one of the things you mentioned were paper design, I think you mentioned high porosity paper.

A. Yes.

Q. What does high porosity paper do as it relates to changes in Winstons over time?

A. High porosity paper would allow two things that happen, more air to flow into the tobacco column. This would produce greater combustion between puffs. So more of the

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

129

tobacco column would be consumed during the periods between puffs and there would be less tobacco available to produce mainstream smoke. So it would be a means of reducing the yields of tar and nicotine.

Q. So the higher the porosity of the paper, the lower the yields of the tar and nicotine?

A.  Yes.

Q. Does the porosity of the paper act sort of like  it adds air to the tobacco smoke as it's being inhaled?

A.  It allows air to flow in. It also allows diffusion out of the rod.

Q. And so if it allows air to flow in, does it also reduce the harshness, the perceived harshness of the cigarette?

A.  It may.

Q. Is that something that was done to Winstons by adding high porosity paper, is that something that was done to reduce harshness?

A. The principal reason was to reduce tar and nicotine yields for all products with whatever technologies were part of the

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424       www.veritext.com        (212) 490-3430

130

design.  The entire final product would be evaluated in terms of its general acceptability.  So it's not that one technology unto itself would be something to dial in harshness, for example, it really is the combined technologies, the cigarette design overall that would be evaluated for its acceptability.

Q. But one of the reasons why they would use high porosity paper would be to reduce harshness, is that one of the reasons?

A. It's possible, but I think primarily around yield reduction.

Q. Was one of the reasons it was used in the Winstons to reduce harshness?

A. I don't think that was the principal reason, no.  It's possible that it was one.

Q. You agree today that smoking causes lung cancer, right?

A. Yes.

Q. When did R. J. Reynolds acknowledge to the public that smoking causes lung cancer?

A. To my knowledge, R. J. Reynolds has

first put that forward in terms of the website probably in about the year 2000. I think that Reynolds recognized for many years before that and stated publicaliy that there was a statical association that had been reported in various studies. But I believe that the first time that that appeared that would have been about the year 2000.

Q. When did R. J. Reynolds acknowledge internally within R. J. Reynolds itself that smoking caused lung cancer?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't believe that there was a single date or a single point in time. This was a scientific question.  I think each of the scientists within the department probably reached the conclusions at different points in time. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. When did you reach the conclusion that smoking caused lung cancer?

A. In terms of myself, I was raised during the time that was  since the 1950's, of course, widespread awareness of the risks

of smoking. My parents have taught me that there are risks.  Health classes that I had in school, in high school and so on, had taught me that.

So in terms of the concept that there were risks associated with smoking, that smoking could cause various types of diseases, this was something that had been put forward by the Surgeon General in public health campaigns with president warnings. So I think that before I joined the company, I had been taught this, I believed it without understanding fully the science of everything.

Q.    So even before you started with R. J. Reynolds, you believed that smoking caused lung cancer?

A. That's what I had been taught, yes.

Q. And when you started working at R. J. Reynolds, you still believed that smoking caused lung cancer?

A.  I believed that there were risks associated with smoking and that it was possible that cigarette smoking may cause cancer in some individuals, yes.

Q. There is a lot of hedging going on there, and X am really trying to get to whether you believed when you were working at R. J. Reynolds in the early '80's that smoking caused lung cancer.

MR. KREINER: Object to the

perforatory tone about hedging. THE WITNESS:  In terms of my

earlier answer, that is what I believed. BY MR. VINIK:

Q.    You believed that smoking causes lung cancer?

A. As I stated in my earlier answer.

Q.  In your earlier answer, you stated that you believed that there was a risk of lung cancer from smoking, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that any different from saying that smoking causes lung cancer in your mind?

A. It is different in that one of the things that troubled me personally was the concept of saying something caused something else without recognizing that  the concepts of risks and the concepts that it's not true for everyone.

So for me personally, when I considered the word "cause," I considered that from a standpoint of being uniform and for everyone. And so I've personally always had the view that it may cause cancer in some individuals, it may be one important factor, it may be one of many factors. A person's family history, their heredity, their susceptibility, for example, is another factor. And so for me, it was  in terms of language, it was the clarity around the fact that it is a risk, that it may cause it for some individuals, but that's not true for all individuals and that it doesn't carry the same risk for all individuals.  It's one factor.

Q.  So you were convinced yourself that at least in some individuals, smoking did cause lung cancer?

A. Yes.

Q. Did R. J. Reynolds acknowledge publically that at least for some individuals, smoking caused lung cancer in the '80's?

A. Reynolds would have acknowledged

their views in a straightforward manner. Their views were that there was a statistical association, that there had been studies conducted that showed that smokers had a higher incidence of smoking-related diseases than nonsmokers.

In terms of stating with the words that smoking caused lung cancer, that would have been about the year 2000, I believe.

Q. So in the '60's when you were working there, Reynolds never said at any point, at least for some individuals, smoking causes lung cancer?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: Again, in my earlier answer, I said my view is that smoking may cause in some individuals, and again, that it was one of many potential factors.

So my view is not that it caused necessarily, but that it could be a significant fact that there was a risk from smoking. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. I think the answer is a little bit

136

different you are giving now.  So let me just make sure I understand what your answer is. Was it your view in the 1980's that at least for some individuals, smoking caused lung cancer?

A. No, as I indicated in my earliest answer, my view at that time was that smoking may cause lung cancer and other diseases in some individuals.

Q.    But your view is that it did not necessarily cause cancer in anybody?

A. That it, along with other factors, may contribute. So my view is that it may, and especially as I began to work in the industry and learn about all of the data, there were many things that were known and many things that were not known, but my view in the early 1980's, at the time I joined the company, from my education and so on, was that there were clear risks from smoking, that's what I had been taught. I understood there were warnings on the packs, I understood all the public media and education and so on.

My personal view is that it may

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424       www.veritext.com        (212) 490-3430

137

cause lung cancer in some individuals, that it wasn't necessarily for individuals that got cancer that were smokers the only factor and that not everyone that smoked would develop lung cancer.

Q. Is it your view the same today, that smoking may cause lung cancer?

A. There is a lot more data, I believe, today that smoking does cause lung cancer in some individuals.

Q. So your view today is that smoking, at least for some individuals, does cause lung cancer?

A. Yes. And by "cause lung cancer," I mean would be the most significant factor in the development of the disease.

Q. And that was not your view in the 1980*s, that smoking, in at least some individuals, was the most significant factor causing lung cancer?

A. My view then was that it may be in some individuals, but I wasn't of the same view that I am today, no.

Q.  In the 1980's, did R. J. Reynolds publically acknowledge that smoking may be

138

the most significant factor in the causation of lung cancer in any individuals?

A. No. Again, Reynolds would have acknowledged and been clear on the fact that there was awareness of the risks, that there were risks, that, again, studies that have been conducted, epidemiology studies, showed that populations of smokers had greater incidence of certain diseases than populations of nonsmokers.

Q.    But they didn't acknowledge that smoking may be the most significant risk for lung cancer in some individuals?

A. Not in that way, no.

Q. So their public beliefs with regard to lung cancer was a little different than your personal beliefs with regard to lung cancer and smoking?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. BY MR. VINIK:

Q.    Little different?

A.  It's possible that they were.

Q.  It's possible or was?

A. I don't know that we hold particularly different beliefs in that way.

We may have articulated them differently.

Q. You believe that it has always been important for R. J. Reynolds to be upfront and honest with its customers?

A. Yes, I think that Reynolds has always put forward their views in a straightforward manner,

Q. And you think it's important for them to have done that?

A. Yes, I think that having guiding principles and beliefs and making those known is important.

Q. And that's always been the case from the 1950's, as far as you know, through today?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you believe that it's always been important for R. J. Reynolds to tell the whole truth to its customers?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: I believe that

Reynolds should put forward their

beliefs. In a scientific area, that

A. Yes.

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: I believe, yes. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. You believe it's always been true from the 1950's to today that R. J. Reynolds not lie by omission to their customers? MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: Yes. BY MR. VINIK:

MR. KREXNER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I believe that smokers have a wide range of information available to them, that they should rely upon R. J. Reynolds to put forward their views in a straightforward fashion, they should consider the views of the public health community, the Surgeon General, the popular press* I mean, there are many different types of information available to them.

customer to rely on the fact that R. J.

Reynolds is not misleading them?

MR KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Yes, I think they should expect that the company has guiding principles and beliefs and that they are communicating those when appropriate in a straightforward manner.

the 1950's up to today?

Q. Does R. J. Reynolds have a responsibility to share with its customers when it learns about the danger of cigarettes as it learns it?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: I think that Reynolds has a responsibility to publish the science that they conduct in an appropriate manner, that they have the responsibility to communicate their views, their guiding principles and beliefs in a straightforward manner, and those should be done in appropriate venues. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. So if R. J. Reynolds learned something about the dangers of cigarettes, say, in 1980, you don't think it's appropriate for them to not say anything

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS: Again, it's a hypothetical, but depending upon what it would be, they should research it thoroughly and they should seek to understand any conclusions that are reached. And then in terms of the science that's conducted, it should be communicated through the appropriate scientific venue, that is, publication in a peer reviewed journal or some other process that would be appropriate, depending upon the type of work.

Q. I am going to show you what we have marked as Exhibit Number 9.  (Handing.) Do you recognize that as a screen shot of a page from Reynolds' website today?

A. Yes.

Q, And so the top of the first page of Exhibit 9 says, "R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company believes that individuals should rely on the conclusions of the U.S. Surgeon General, the Centers for Disease Control and other public health and medical officials when making decisions regarding smoking."

A. Yes.

Q. Is that accurate today?

A. Yes, I think that R. J. Reynolds has, as part of its guiding principles and beliefs, that those that are considering using tobacco products or that use tobacco products should consider the U.S. Surgeon

General and the Centers for Disease Control and other public and medical health officials, and that's what this is indicating.

Q. Reynolds believes that individuals should rely on the conclusions of the Surgeon General and those others named/ right?

A. Yes.

Q. But it's a little more than just consider their conclusions, Reynolds is saying they should rely on their conclusions/ right?

A. Well, each person ultimately should be fully informed. They will make their own decisions about what they choose to do. They should consider them, they should rely upon the fact that they are the views of the Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control. They will make their own decision about what they choose to do as far as if they choose to use a tobacco product/ if they choose to smoke versus use a smokeless form of tobacco.

Q. Are you saying anything different from what's said in here on the website?

cigarettes causes, among other things, lung cancer.

A. No.

Q. That cigarettes containing nicotine are addictive.

Do you dispute that?

A. No.

Q. That the tobacco companies placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous.

Do you dispute that?

A. That's not my view. I would not agree with it.

Q. That tobacco companies concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available knowing that the material was false or misleading or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or both.

A. X would not agree with that.

Q,  In fact, your testimony today and in the Hiott case is really the exact opposite of that, isn't it?

Q. When did R. J. Reynolds acknowledge that nicotine was addictive?

A. R. J. Reynolds  scientists at R. J. Reynolds and R. J. Reynolds in general has been aware that cigarette smoking is something that can be difficult for people to quit for many years.  X think this is something that's widely known.  I believe that Reynolds' scientists held the view that cigarette smoking was something that was a habit and that the scientists that were knowledgeable in that area felt that it was, according to the 1964 Surgeon General's definition, habituating.

X think that as far as nicotine itself, the compound nicotine did not change at any point in time, so there has been no

change from the 1950's or '60's or beyond in terms of the compound itself, but what has changed is the definition of addiction that was recast or redeveloped in the Surgeon General's report in 1988 or just before that, and that Reynolds' scientists did not hold that view, that nicotine met that definition.

But today, as the definition is commonly used, Reynolds believes that nicotine and tobacco and cigarette smoke is addictive, and I don't think that that's been particularly different as far as understanding that cigarettes are something that people may use for an extended period of time, that they may be difficult to quit using, some people find it relatively difficult to try many times, other people may find it more straightforward to quit, and Reynolds has understood that for some time.

Q. When was the first time R. J. Reynolds publically acknowledged that nicotine was actually addictive?

A. Again, I believe in the late 1990's to 2000 is when it would have been available on our website and so on.

Q.  So when it went on your website was the first time that R. J. Reynolds acknowledged that nicotine was addictive?

A. Reynolds has never indicated that smoking isn't something can be difficult to stop. In terms of the scientific definition of addiction, I think there was the view by the scientists at Reynolds that nicotine was habituating, that their scientific views didn't change in the 1988 time frame, that they still felt that it was habituating by the definitions that had existed prior to that time, but that it became clear that over time, that part of what our company wants to do is align itself with the expectations of society, with the understandings of society and as the definition is typically used today or as it's thought of today, the word "addiction," nicotine is addictive.

And so prior to that time, I don't know that it was put forward in those terms, but I believe it would have been the late 1990's to early 2000.

Q. The late 1990's, meaning 1999?

A.  In that general time frame.

Q. It was when the website went up?

A.  Yes, when it would have appeared there.

Q.    Okay. You said that the definition of addiction changed in 1988, right?

A. Yes, in that time frame. It may have been prior to the '88 Surgeon Generalfs report, but in the 1988 time frame, yes.

Q. And prior to that, R. J. Reynolds knew that it was at least habituating?

A. Yes.

Q. And it was acknowledged internally that it was at least habituating?

A. That was the view of Reynolds' scientists, yes, that it was habituating, that cigarettes were something that people would oftentimes smoke for an extended period of time, that some people could find it difficult to quit smoking.

Q. You've seen the video of the Haxman hearings, right?

A. I have seen that, yes.

Q. You understand what I mean when I say "Waxman hearings"?

Q. Those are the hearings in front of Congress where tobacco executives testified in front of Congress in 1994, right?

A. In front of that committee, yes. Q. And you saw the video where the chief executive of R. J. Reynolds swore to Congress at that hearing that cigarettes were not addictive, right?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: Yes, I saw the video and saw his overall statement and testimony and he put forward that, again, he and the company and the scientists in the company believed it was habituating, that it was not something that was intoxicating like cocaine or heroin and did not meet the definition of addiction as he understood it traditionally. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. Was that your view in 1994? A. I would say generally yes* I don't know that I'd asked myself that specific question of what is my view, but I understood that smoking could be difficult to quit.  I

had family members, some found it very easy to quit, put the cigarettes in the drawer and just stopped, others that said it was more difficult. So I understood that some people could find it difficult to quit smoking. I also understood that many, many people had quit, many of them without any kind of assistance in doing so.

Q. You said cigarettes were not intoxicating. Was it your view at that time that because cigarettes were not intoxicating, they couldn't be addictive?

A.  It was my view that the distinctions that were made in 1964 by the Surgeon General's report at that time were important distinctions and that it was my view that in considering the definitions in 1964, I viewed nicotine as clearly habituating.

As far as the change in the definition, that is something that didn't change the aspects of smoking or nicotine itself.

Q. It's habituating and not addicting because it's not intoxicating, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  That was the big difference in your mind between nicotine and, say, heroin or cocaine?

A. That was one of them. I mean, part of it was just a common sense understanding. I mean, it was something that was just very clear from my experience living in the United States and observing the situation in the world.

Q. Now, the definition changed in 1988 according to the Surgeon General, right?

A.  In that time frame, yes.

Q.  The big part of the definitional change was that they didn't consider that it had to be intoxicating in order to be addicting, right?

A. That was one of the principal changes, yes.

Q. Based on the new definition, nicotine was addictive, right?

A. Based on the new definition, I think that clearly the Surgeon General and others felt that it was addictive. So by that definition, that was their view, yes.

A.  Yes.

Q. So it was six years after the definition of addiction had already changed?

A.  Yes.

Q. You were at the company in 1994, right?

A.  I was, yes.

Q. Did you have any concerns regarding the testimony of R. J. Reynolds' CEO at the hearing?

A. No, X believe that the testimony was based upon the company's understanding of the views of the scientists at that time and that the testimony was consistent with those views.

Q. The company was sticking with the 1964 definition no matter what?

sticking with the views of the

scientists.  It was the scientists'

opinion, expert opinion, that it was

best classified and most appropriately

classified as habituating. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. Scientists within R. J. Reynolds?

A.  Yes.

Q. And nicotine has an effect on the human brain, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you studied the effect of nicotine on the human brain?

A.  I haven't personally studied it, no.

Q.  Is there someone at R. J. Reynolds who has studied the effect of nicotine on the human brain?

A.  There have been, as I indicated in an earlier answer, scientists that have conducted research around the biology of nicotine, and some of that would include understanding some of those effects and modeling and so on.

Q. When did R. J. Reynolds first learn

that nicotine had an effect on the human brain?

A.  I don't know the answer to that.  I think that, again, as  I don't know the exact date.

Q. Was it in the '60's?

A. I think probably the effects of nicotine were well known just from the standpoint of people smoking and various people at the company being smokers. As far as  by effects, I don't know exactly what you mean, but in terms of the biology of the it and the detailed aspects of it, that was science that has emerged and continues to emerge.

Q. R. J. Reynolds understood that

i. nicotine had physiological effects even in

the '50's, didn't they?

A. I would say yes.

Q.  Is it a bad thing that cigarettes

are addictive?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form.

THE WITNESS: I'm not sure what you

mean by "a bad thing."

Q. Would R. J. Reynolds prefer that

cigarettes were not addictive?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know that that's an appropriate way to consider it. I think the reality is that nicotine is part of tobacco, that nicotine contributes to the flavor of tobacco and tobacco smoke, that cigarette smoking can be difficult, especially for some individuals, to quit when they choose to do so, but nicotine is part of the flavor, nicotine is part of the overall experience.

In terms of why people smoke, each person probably has a difference in terms of the relative importance of different factors; the taste, the ritual and so on. For some, nicotine may be very important, for others, not as important.  So I don't know how best to answer that question.

BY MR, VINIK:

Q. Well, did R. J. Reynolds ever do

any research with regard to the possibility

of making their product nonaddictive?

A. Reynolds has developed products that are very low tar and nicotine yielding products, and those products have been commercialized and made available to smokers*

In terms of tobacco products, all tobacco products contain nicotine, so I don't know that we have a test for addictiveness as such.

Q. When you say "all tobacco products contain nicotine," nicotine can be removed from tobacco, right?

A. It can, it can be greatly reduced. It's difficult to completely remove it, but it can be reduced in substantial amount.

Q,    It can be removed down to the level where the cigarettes are nonaddictive, right?

A. In terms of what would be a level that might be addictive, this is a scientific question that's still open. In fact, there are studies going on currently, being reported in the literature, to look at different amounts of nicotine. There have been low nicotine products put on the market commercially. There is even a set of

products that the government has recently commissioned to try and understand that question to see is there such a thing.

Q.    Is it your testimony that R. J. Reynolds doesn't know how to remove enough nicotine from its cigarettes to make cigarettes nonaddictive?

A.  It's my testimony that I don't know that there is a specific value that would make a product nonaddictive and that people smoke for a variety of reasons, nicotine being one of them. I think Reynolds does have knowledge about how to remove nicotine from tobacco. That is separate from knowledge that would be required to make an acceptable product, something that someone would find to taste good, for example.

But, no, I don't think that they are necessarily  there is not knowledge about what level would be addictive and what level wouldn't, nor would I expect necessarily that if there is such a thing, that it would be a single value, necessarily.

Q. What's the lowest nicotine value cigarette that Reynolds knows how to make?

A.  The lowest yielding cigarette that Reynolds would currently manufacture and sell would be below .1 milligrams of nicotine per cigarette yield.

Q. Does Reynolds know how to make a cigarette that's below that value?

A. Perhaps in principle, yes. I don't know that it would be consumer acceptable.

Q. Can Reynolds make a cigarette that's a tenth of that value?

A. It would be difficult to do that. I don't know that it could be a tenth. It's possible that there could be something a bit lower than that.

Q. Has Reynolds ever tried to make a conventional cigarette with the nicotine removed?

A. As far as commercializing a cigarette with nicotine removed, I believe the answer would be no. Reynolds is aware of research by others as well as products that have been commercialized or put into test market that had low levels of nicotine, and these haven't been preferred by smokers.

Q. Reynolds spends or has spent quite

(212) 490-3430

169

a lot of money in researching how to make their cigarettes safer, right?

A. In how to reduce the risks of the cigarette, yes.

Q. Is that different from safer?

A. My personal view is the word "safe" means a complete absence of risk, and so if something is either safe or it isn't, you can't go beyond no risk and safer. But generally when people use the word "safer," they mean reduced in risk, so I was merely clarifying that.

Q. How much money has Reynolds spent in the last ten years in researching how to make cigarettes reduced in risk?

A. Over the last ten years? I don't know that figure right off. Reynolds has spent well over a billion dollars in trying to reduce the risks of cigarettes. In the time that I have been there, really since even the Premier project and beyond, it's been well over a billion dollars. In the last ten years, it's been a substantial amount. I don't have the exact dollar figure in mind.

Q. But Reynolds hasn't been able to create a cigarette that's totally safe, right?

A. All tobacco products have risks and no tobacco product is without risk.

Q.    How much money has Reynolds spent in the last ten years researching how to take the addictiveness out of their product?

A.  There's no test for addictiveness, there's not a particular test to say this product is addictive and this product is not. So there is no end point like that.

What Reynolds has done is to develop a range of products over time that reduce the yields of tar and nicotine that is in a number of different cigarettes. They also have developed tobacco products that don't produce smoke that aren't combustible, the intention of smokers considering those as an alternative if they are concerned about the risks of smoking.

Q. Those noncombustible products are still addictive, aren't they?

A. All tobacco products contain nicotine and all would be considered

addictive, yes.

Q. How many regular smokers would there be if Reynolds took the addictiveness out of their product?

MR KREINER: Objection to the form. THE WITNESS: I don't know that I

can answer that question. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. Is that something that Reynolds has researched?

A. Not to my knowledge, no. I believe that Reynolds would expect that if we were to produce a product with very low nicotine, based on the products that have been test marketed of that type, that smokers would not prefer them, and so if our brands were all like that, they would probably choose to smoke someone else's brands.

Q.    Smokers don't prefer cigarettes that are nonaddictive?

A. Smokers don't prefer cigarettes that they don't like the taste of, that they don't enjoy, and I don't think that a smoker would consider it from the standpoint of that it's addictive or not. In terms of any

MR. VINIK: Let's mark this as our next document.

(Borgerding Exhibit 11 was marked for identification.) BY MR, VINIK:

Q, I show you a document that's been marked as Exhibit 11. The front page says, "Research planning memorandum on the nature of the tobacco business and the crucial role nicotine therein." There is a Bates number on the first page that is RJ003500.0002, and it goes through .0010 (Handing.)

This is a document you have seen before, right?

A. If you give me a moment to read through it, I will answer.

MR KREINER:  I will just make a note for the record that this is not at least a copy as it's produced from R. J, Reynolds' files. It's currently available on the R. J. Reynolds' website. In that regard, it has a

confidentiality legend on the right-hand side that I'm not sure why it's there or when this was produced.  Certainly the document is no longer claimed to be confidential and it's publically available on Reynolds' website.

In addition, there seems to be Bates stamps in the lower right-hand corner that being with the letters RJ that were not put there by R. J. Reynolds, and I do not know the source of that.

THE WITNESS: I haven't read it thoroughly, but I believe I have seen this document before. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. And this is a document that was written by RJR's Claude Teague back in 1972, right?

A.  Yes.

Q. Who is Claude Teague? A.  Claude Teague was someone that worked at R. J. Reynolds for a number of years. He worked primarily in Reynolds' tobacco research and development department.

For much of that time, he would have been a manager in the area.

Q. That's the same department that you worked in and have worked in since 1980, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you know Claude Teague?

A.  Yes, I knew Dr. Teague. Not well, but I knew of Dr. Teague.

Q. Was he your superior at any point in time?

A. No.

Q. Was he senior to you at the same time you were working there?

A. He would have had a title that was more senior than mine.

Q. Do you know what his title was in 1972?

A. In 1972, I don't know what his title would have been.

Q. Do you know what his title was in 1980 when you joined R. J. Reynolds?

A.  In 1980, I believe he would have been an assistant to the vice president working on special projects. For example, he

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424        www.veritext.com

helped set up the education program that has continued in the years since.

Q. When you say the vice president, is that the person who was the head of the research and development at that time?

A. Yes.

Q. So he was reporting directly to the head of the R and D department?

A. At that time, not in a scientific capacity, but more as sort of an assistant on certain projects like the education program.

Q. Let's turn to the first page of the document.

A. By "the first page," you mean 

Q. The page after the cover page.

A.  Okay.

Q. In the first paragraph right in the middle, there is a sentence that says, "Nicotine is known to be a habit forming alkaloid."

Do you see that?

A. Yes.

Q. So at least far back as 1972, you agreed that R. J. Reynolds recognized that nicotine was a habit forming alkaloid, right?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  No, I would  it would be my view that in this document, Dr. Teague has expressed that, but it's not clear to me what this document is and that it's not a  it's not an R and D report or R and D memorandum, it seems to be a document that Dr. Teague created. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. So you don't know whether or not R. J. Reynolds believed in 1972 that nicotine was a habit forming alkaloid?

A.  I think that I have indicated in my earlier answer that there were many people at Reynolds at that time that smoked. I think they understood that it was a habit that many had. So I believe generally they understood that smoking was a habit and they understood that nicotine was part of tobacco and tobacco smoke.

Q. But you don't think that they understood that it was a habit forming alkaloid?

A. I believe they understood it was

also an alkaloid as far as the chemical Itself being classified as an alkaloid.

Q. In the third line, Claude Teague characterizes nicotine as "a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects." Do you see that?

A.  I'm sorry, In which line?

Q. The third line, It starts on the third line.

A. I see that, yes.

Q. Would you agree that R. J. Reynolds, at least as early as 1972, believed that nicotine was a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know that

R. J. Reynolds believed that. I see

that Dr. Teague put It In this document.

Again, this Isn't an R and D memorandum

or an R and D report, It seems to be a

document that he prepared.

I think that Reynolds scientists

would have understood that nicotine was

an alkaloid, that would have understood

that It's part of the tobacco plant,

tobacco smoke and that it had various

effects. BY MR. VINIK:

Q.  "Various effects" meaning physiological effects?

A. Yes.

Q. What are physiological effects, what does that mean?

A. Physiological effects would be effects upon the body.

Q. So one of the physiological effects could be, for example, binding to nicotine receptors in the brain, right?

A. That would be perhaps more of a mechanism than an effect.

Effect may be, for example, that one's blood pressure increased.

Q. Okay. What is an alkaloid?

A. An alkaloid is a designation of a type of molecule.

Q.    Is it a specific type of molecule?

A. It would be, in this case, certain compounds that are present in tobacco such as nicotine, nornicotine, myasmine, anatabine, these types of molecules.

reaction to the 1980 Surgeon General's report?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS: I don't remember a

specific reaction. Again, I know our

scientists were of the view that

nicotine had been classified

appropriately by the 1964 Surgeon

General's definition. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. Did R. J. Reynolds think that the claims made in the 1988 Surgeon General's report was irresponsible and scare tactics?

A. I don't know one way or the other. I think that Reynolds' view was that nicotine was habituating, they recognized that many people had quit smoking, and many without any sort of assistance in doing so and they recognized for some it could be quite difficult.

Q. If in 1988 you had seen that R. J. Reynolds had made a claim that the Surgeon General's report that cigarettes are addictive was irresponsible and scare tactics, would that have concerned you in any

way?

MR. KREINER: Objection to the form.

THE WITNESS: I would have expected Reynolds to put forward their views in a straightforward manner and I think that Reynolds recognized that the Surgeon General had changed the definition and the scientists were of the view that that wasn't correct, and beyond that, I wouldn't have expected particular comment.

BY MR. VINIK:

Q.  It wouldn't be your view in 1988

that the Surgeon General was engaging in

irresponsible scare tactics, is it?

MR KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: I don't know that I held a view one way or the other at that point in time. I was of the view that the Surgeon General had a stated goal, a stated mission, and that it evolved from one of informing and educating the public about the risks of smoking and eliminating smoking from our society.

184

BY MR. VINIK:

Q.  Is that a goal that you did not agree with?

A. I did not agree that smoking was something that, unless Congress were to outlaw cigarettes, would not be part of our society. It was my view that many people would continue to smoke by choice, and that in doing so, that there should be research and science conducted to understand the risks of smoking and to try to reduce those.

So much like the calls, from the National Cancer Institute, my view was that a manufacturer such as R. J. Reynolds should be actively conducting research to understand and reduce the risks of smoking.  It was my view that smoking was something that throughout my lifetime was likely to be part of our society.

Q. Did Reynolds ever state publically that a cigarette smoker's tobacco smoking pattern is determined principally by his nicotine dosage requirements?

A. Not to my knowledge, no, I don't believe that that would be factual.

Q. When was the first time that R. J. Reynolds became aware that there were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in their cigarettes?

A.  In the 1950's.

Q. Those are sometimes referred to as PAH's?

A. Yes, they are.

Q. PAH's are carcinogens?

A. PAH's are classified as known possible or probable human carcinogens.

Q. When was the first time that R. J. Reynolds became aware that there were something called tobacco specific nitrosamines in their cigarettes?

A.  In the 1970's.

Q. Those were sometimes referred to as TSN's, right?

A. They're normally or frequently referred to as TSNA's.

Q. Okay. And TSNA's are also carcinogenic, right?

A.  Some TSNA's have been classified as known possible or probable carcinogens, yes.

Reynolds learned that there was a possibility that cigarettes caused lung cancer?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS: I don't know that there was a single specific time. I think that there was data generated over an extended period of time. I think that some of the things that came about in the 1950's, for example, were some tests with animals, the so-called mouse skin painting studies. That there were also subsequent, although some perhaps preceding that, epidemiology or so-called statistical studies that looked at incidence of disease within the population. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. So this was as early as the 1950's, R. J. Reynolds became aware that there was at least a possibility that their cigarettes were causing lung cancer?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: They became aware that, for example, such work was being conducted. They became aware that

certain compounds were present. As far as understanding that those facts translated into an actual concept of causing or that they were relevant was something that probably developed in a much longer time frame.

BY MR. VINIK:

Q. Well, that's not really what I am

asking. I'm asking when they became aware

that cigarette smoking possibly caused lung

cancer?

MR. KREINER: Objection to the form.

THE WITNESS: Again, I would suggest that there were those of the view that it was one of several things that may be causing change within the population, and as far as causing, I think that that probably came later, that there would be enough information to begin to suggest that it was more likely than some other types of exposures, for example.

the mouse painting studies and after some of the epidemiological studies that go back to the '50's and *60's, R. J. Reynolds was still not of the view at that time that there was a possibility that smoking caused lung cancer?

A. I believe that it put forward the possibility that there was biological activity, that, in general, those led to the question of is there biological activity associated with exposure to cigarette smoke and what may be driving it?

Q,    Reynolds was well aware of the mouse painting studies, right?

A.  Yes.

Q. And well aware of the epidemiological studies, right?

A.  Yes.

Q. Reynolds in general kept itself well apprised of the science in the area of tobacco smoking and disease at least as early as the 1950's, right?

A.  I believe so, yes.

Q. And R. J. Reynolds kept itself well apprised of any published studies on cigarette smoking throughout this time frame.

Q. I am going to show you what's been marked as Exhibit 13. It's a document dated September 28, 1956. The author is Alan Rodgman. There are a number of Bates numbers on the document. The first page has one number that's 504912057 and it goes through 504912106.  (Handing.)

Do you recognize this document?

A. If I could have just a moment to 

Q.  Sure.

A.  Yes.

Q. This is a document authored by Dr. Alan Rodgman?

A.  Yes, it is.

Q. And he was at RJR at the time?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you know what his position was at the time he authored this document?

A.  I don't know specifically, but I would expect it's probably research chemist.

Q. And he was in the research and development department?

A. Yes.

Q. Same department you're in now?

A. Yes.

Q. Did you know Dr. Rodgman?

A. Yes.

Q. You met him when you started at R. J. Reynolds in 1980?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did you work with him?

A.  Yes.

Q. In what capacity?

A. Just as  I worked with him from the standpoint of being in the same department. I've never reported to Dr. Rodgman, but I have interacted with him throughout the years.

Q. Have you interacted with him on projects?

A. Generally, no. I mean, I have been

aware of his projects and vice versa, but we haven't been part of a project team together, no.

Q. What was Dr. Rodgman's position when you started in 1980, do you remember?

A. When I started in 1980, he would have been the head of the chemical division.

Q. And what was the highest position that he reached?

A. I believe it was director.

Q. Director? So he would have reported at one point to the head of the research and development department?

A. Yes.

Q. Let's turn to the first page of the document after the table of contents, the introduction page. The first sentence of that introduction paragraph states  and I'm just going to leave out some numbers, but it states that, "Statistical analysis based on retrospective and prospective clinical studies have indicated that tobacco smoke, and in particular, cigarette smoke is major causative factor in the present high and increasing incidence of cancer of the

A.  Yes.

Q. Do you have an understanding of what a retrospective clinical study is?

A. Yes.

Q. What's a retrospective clinical study?

A.  In simple terms, it's one looking backwards in time, things that have happened in the past.

Q. And what's a prospective clinical study?

A. It would be the opposite of that, it's looking forward in time or monitoring onward into time.

Q. And is it your understanding that at this point in time, in 1956, Dr. Rodgman was of the view that statistical analyses based on both retrospective and prospective clinical studies indicated that tobacco smoke, and in particular, cigarette smoke was a major causative factor in the present high incidence of cancer of the respiratory system in a human?

now well established that cigarette smoke does contain several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and considering the potential and actual carcinogenic activity of a number of these compounds, a method of either complete removal or almost complete removal of these compounds from cigarette smoke is required."

Do you see that? A. I see most of it. I can't read underneath of the stamped things, so I couldn't read each of those words. But generally, yes.

Q. Is it your understanding that at least as early as 1956, the date of this document, R. J. Reynolds understood that there were several compounds in cigarette smoke that had potential and actual carcinogenic activity?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: It's my understanding that Dr. Rodgman prepared this document, that he indicated that these compounds were present and that they had activity. It's not clear from this what the

significance of that was considered to be by Dr. Rodgman in terms of the areas of the document that we've looked at just now.

But, yes, that these compounds are present in the condensate and that the compounds have been reported to have biological activity that was reported by Dr. Rodgman in this document in '56. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. R. J. Reynolds, at that point in time, was of the view that if it could, it would like to remove those compounds from the cigarette smoke, correct?

A. Again, this document is a document prepared by Dr. Rodgman. The sentence that you just read a moment ago is making a recommendation.  I think throughout my career, Reynolds clearly has worked to significantly reduce or eliminate compounds such as selected PAH's from smoke.

Q. And did that effort begin in the 1950's?

A. I believe it did, yes.

Q. And they wanted to remove those

compounds from smoke because it was believed that those compounds could possibly be causing cancer in humans, right?

A. Yes, to reduce the potential for exposure to them.

Q. Did you have any discussions with Dr. Rodgman regarding his views on whether or not the statistical data with regard to cigarette smoke and disease was sufficient or insufficient to prove that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer?

A.  I don't recall ever having such a discussion, no.

Q. Have any discussions with anyone internally at R. J. Reynolds about that topic in the 1980's?

A. X don't recall any specific discussions. I think that my impression is there were scientists that had concerns and questions about the overall set of facts. In other words, one fact was that there were studies that showed that the incidence of smoking-related diseases was greater in a population of smokers than nonsmokers. There had been mouse skin painting studies. But,

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

ropgNbr=197

for example, there were scientists that were concerned that there was not an inhalation model, there were scientists that were concerned that the  both in Reynolds and outside of Reynolds, that mouse skin painting may or may not be relevant in terms of understanding the potential for effects in man.

So I am aware that there have been a range of views in that regard, and I would expect there would have been in the 1980's.

Q. But you don't remember any specific discussions that you had yourself with regard to whether or not the statistical data was really enough to show that smoking caused lung cancer?

A. None that come to mind, no.

Q. How about in the "90fs?

A.  No.

Q.  So none of the R. J. Reynolds scientists, as far as you know, discussed internally whether or not the statistical data was enough to prove that lung cancer was being caused by cigarette smoking?

But each scientist was queried and each scientist would have expressed a view. BY MR. VINIK:

Q.  In the 1990's, how many R. J. Reynolds scientists do you remember having a view that the statistical data was enough to make it more probable than not that smoking caused lung cancer?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't recall anything where that specific question was asked, again, in a meeting where, for example, my view was asked regarding from all of the science that I was aware of, all of the information that I had reviewed that I believed that smoking

person would have been asked a question

like that, each scientist, and they

weren't asked about that individual

specific piece outside of the totality

of the available data. MR. VINIK:

Q. Do you remember any scientist within R. J. Reynolds articulating a view that smoking did cause lung cancer? And I am not talking about today, I am talking about the '80's and '90's.

A.  I don't know.

Q. Not one?

A. X don't recall that, no.

Q. Do you recall any scientists at R. J. Reynolds in the '80's or '90's articulating the. view that based on the available evidence, it was more probable than not that smoking cigarettes caused lung cancer?

A. I don't recall that, no.

Q. Was that ever a topic that was discussed at R. J. Reynolds in the '80's or '90's?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: As far as that specific question, it's possible that there were meetings where that was discussed. I am not aware of one where that specific question was posed. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. Did R. J. Reynolds ever look at the probability to see whether or not it was more probable than not that smoking caused lung cancer in the '80's or '90's?

A. I think that Reynolds was aware of the studies that had been conducted in terms of the fact that there was a greater incidence of smoking-related disease.  I think that over the course of many years, quite a number of things evolved in terms of science. Much progress was made in terms of understanding potential mechanisms and understanding the complexities of cigarette

smoke, new biological tests were developed and applied, and so the biological activity of smoke was more fully understood. I think all of these things together were considered,

Q. R. J. Reynolds believes today that it's more probable than not that smoking causes lung cancer, right?

A. Reynolds believes today that smoking causes lung cancer in some individuals.

Q. What was the tipping point for the change in Reynolds' thinking on that issue?

A.  I don't think there was a single tipping point or a single point in time, I think that it was the cumulative amount of data that was generated, I think in part it was related to a change in the scientists at the company in terms of many that was classically trained in the 1940's or '50's retired and many of the younger scientists that joined, such as myself, were taught all throughout our childhood that smoking was a risk for disease. And so I think all of those things together, changes in the amount of data, changes in the scientists

considering the data came to bear on that view.

Q. Which change in data are you referring to when you say changes in the data?

A. A number of things; understanding about various biological tests, understanding about the composition of smoke, about the composition of tobacco, additional studies that were conducted in terms of studies such as the CPSl and CPS2 are epidemiology studies that were conducted. All of that data together.

Q. When was CPSl?

A. If I recall correctly, it would have been in the mid '60's,

Q. And when was CPS2?

A. I believe that would have been in the early 1980's.

Q. And when did these other studies that you mentioned come out?

A. They were all throughout that time. There were constantly new tests being developed, for example, the Ames Test For Mutagenicity.

Q. When was that?

A.  That was in the late 1970's.

Q. And explain to me what CPS1 is.

A. CPS1 is cancer prevention study one, it was the first of that type of study. One of the things that it focused on was understanding smoking behaviors.  It also, if I recall correctly, focused upon the difference in incidence of lung cancer for smokers that smoked filtered versus non-filtered cigarettes.

Q. What was the results of CPS1?

A. Some of the general results were to understand the smoking behaviors, one of the results was that the risk for lung cancer was significantly greater with non-filtered cigarettes as compared to filtered cigarettes.

Q. And then CPS2 you also mentioned. What was that?

A. CPS 2 just would have been another time slice.  In essence, it would have been looking at a different point in time, looking at the population of smokers then, looking at the products they smoked then.

Q. And what were the results of CPS2 with regard to lung cancer incidence?

A. They did not change to the same extent as they did in the first study. In CPS1, there was a greater reduction than was observed in CPS2.

Q. When you say a "reduction," what do you mean by "reduction" in CPS2?

A. In CPS2, there was not a range of products, for example, that included non-filtered versus filtered in the same proportion and that generally smokers at that time didn't smoke non-filtered cigarettes/ they smoked filtered cigarettes, and so there was not the same differences observed in that there were not as many non-filtered smokers at that point in time.

Q. Were the number of cancer deaths in CPS2, did it show that the number of cancer deaths were dropping or increasing?

A. I don't know that right off. I would have to refresh myself.

Q.    You don't remember?

Reynolds' scientists with regard to what CPS2 was showing and what that meant?

A.  I don't recall any specific discussions, but I am sure that scientists read through it, considered it and it was something that was part of their overall understanding.

Q. It's not something that you remember doing?

A. I didn't do it probably at that time when it first came out, but I've looked at it since.

Q. You've looked at it as part of the preparation you've done for the Engle cases?

A. And  to some extent, and before that as well.

Q. How much before that?

A. Well, probably at least in the 1990's.

Q.    Why were you looking at CPS2 in the 1990's?

A.  Just as part of reading the literature. There's quite a number of things that were coming out, various monographs, some things that referred to the results from

aware of the concept of free nicotine and that they proposed research in that area to understand that further.  There may have been some that even had the view that that was something that should be considered.  It's my view that they were confused.

Q. Does the level of free nicotine in cigarettes affect how quickly the brain receives the nicotine?

A. I don't believe so, no.

Q. And are there any studies that show that that you are aware of?

A. There are a number of studies, recent studies, that would suggest, for example, the exposure to nicotine does not vary depending upon if there's a higher ammonia content in smoke or not or if there's a higher pH or not. There have been studies done that look at speed of nicotine to the brain. One comes to mind that Dr. Judd Rose conducted.  I think that it probably is driven more by the individual than anything to do with the product.

Q.    when you say driven by the individual, you mean driven by how the

individual smokes the cigarette?

A. Probably a combination of factors, both the physiology of the individual and their behavior as well.

Q.  "Their behavior" meaning how they smoke?

A. Yes*

Q. At least in the early 1970*s, many R. J. Reynolds scientists believed that free nicotine affected how quickly nicotine was taken up by the brain, right?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know that

many believed that.  I know that some

put forward the view that free nicotine

was something to study and consider. BY MR. VINIK:

Q.  In the early *70's, R. J. Reynolds did correlation studies between free nicotine and sales, right?

A. I don't know that that's true, no.

Q.    In the early 1970's, R. J. Reynolds did correlation studies between pH and cigarette sales, right?

1970's that they would have done that, no.

Q. Do you recall that R. J. Reynolds ever did any correlation studies between free nicotine or pH correlated with sales? And I am not limiting it to the 1970's, but any time period.

A. There is a document that comes to mind, I believe Ms. Leslie Lewis may have been an author, that looked at market share versus the concept that somehow that was related to pH.

Q. Who was Leslie Lewis?

A.  She was an employee within the research and development department, a scientist.

Q. And when did she do this  did you say it was a memo that you remember seeing?

A. I believe so.

Q. When was this memo?

A. I don't recall the exact date. I believe in the 1990's.

Q. What did she find in the 1990's with regard to any correlation with  did you say pH?

A.  I believe it was pH.

Q. And do you remember who Gloria C. Harllee was?

A.  I don't know.

Q.    It says, "Division: Chemical research," and there is a number of numbers. Was chemical research a division of R. J. Reynolds?

A. Not currently.  It was at that point in time. Not a division of R. J. Reynolds, but a division within research and division.

Q. And it also says, "Project number: 1210."

Do you see that?

A. I see that.

Q. Does that indicate to you anything with regard to how R. J. Reynolds did things back then? Was this like an official project or a study or something like that?

A. Different areas of research were assigned a number for time keeping purposes, and so according to this document, project number 1210 would have been smoke balance

Q.  So this was a memo with regard to an official project that was going on at R. J. Reynolds at the time?

A. Yes.

Q. And who would have gotten this memo on this official project?

A. The page 5 of the document lists a distribution as well as subsequent photocopies.

Q. I see the distribution list includes Mr. William D. Hobbs, right?

A. Yes.

Q. Who was that?

A.  I don't recall Mr. Hobbs' exact role. I believe that he was someone that would have been in the development area.

Q. How about Dr. Murray Senkus, the next name on the list?

A. Dr. Senkus would have been the head of R and D.

Q. He would have been the equivalent of  today that would be  I don't remember his name, the head of R and D today.

A. Mr. Herco.

Q. Mr. Herco, sorry.

So Dr. Murray Senkus would be the equivalent of Mr. Herco today?

A. Yes, in general terms.

Q. I also see Dr. Teague on the list.

A. Yes.

Q.    Who was he back in 1973?

A. He would have had a management responsibility in that time fame.

Q.    Would he have been just under Dr. Senkus, the head of R and D?

A. It's possible, yes.

Q. And the next one I see is Dr. Bluhm?

A. Yes.

Q. Who was that?

A. Dr. Bluhm, at that point in time, would have been in charge of the library, library services activities.

Q. What's the library services?

A. All of the efforts to obtain scientific articles to have a library, scientific information.

Q, Next on the list is Dr. Jones. Who was that?

A.  I didn't know Dr. Jones.  I believe that he would have been, again, like Mr. Hobbs in the development area.

I should note that in 1973, research and development were separate departments. So while today, Mr. Herco is the head of research and development, at this point in time, and at the point that I joined the company, there was a research department and there was a development department.

Q. And this division, chemical research, was it part of research or part of development?

A. Part of research.

Q. So Dr. Murray Senkus was the head of research, the head of development or the head of both?

A. The head of research.

Q. Who was the head of development at the time?

A. X don't know.

Q. It's not any of the people this list?

A. It's possible that it was Mr. Hobbs or Mr. Jones, but I don't know.

Q. And X see Dr. Alan Rodgman here on this distribution list?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that the same Dr. Rodgman that we talked about earlier?

A. Presumably, yes. I have no reason to think otherwise.

Q. Now, it says, "Photo for: Douglas Young," and there is a date next it, 2/12/80.

Would it be the practice in the R. J. Reynolds' research department at this time when photocopies were made for someone to list them on the document and put a date of when the photocopy was given to them?

A. That was the practice at that point in time for official documents such as R and D memoranda. This is an R and D memoranda as the type of document.

Q. So this is an official R. J. Reynolds document?

A. Yes.

Q. Does this document tell you that correlation studies of smoke pH and sales

trends actually were done by R. J. Reynolds in the '60's and '70s?

A. Yes, it tells me that at least in this instance, these individuals in 1973 or just prior to that time did analysis and compared a number of parameters, including the ones you just asked about.

Q. Well, it indicates that correlation studies between smoke pH and sales trends between 1964 and 1972 were made for each brand, and one of the brands is Winston, right?

A.  Yes.

Q. Do you have any reason to believe that that didn't happen?

A. No, I don't.

Q. And in the third paragraph, it says, "A high pH smoke is strong due to a high concentration of unbound or free nicotine in the smoke."

Do you see that?

A. I do, yes.

Q. Do you have any reason to believe that R. J. Reynolds' research at that time did not believe that that was true?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS: My understanding in reading through the literature is that  and in reading through this document is that it makes reference to something presented in reference five at the Tobacco Science Research Conference, and that, my understanding is, derives also from a publication I believe by Dr. Murray that is a document that's on my reliance list, and it puts forward this general concept, it puts forward that, again, the concept of at a certain pH, the product will be more harsh, and so from the standpoint of harshness, it's a parameter that was studied.

That being said, as I've indicated in an earlier answer, all of these data were conducted using the FTC puffing regimen and with the standard techniques available that were at that time, it does note in this document that the pH value is not absolute, that when ~ there was a shift from measuring things with a particulate phase measure, a pad

method, as it refers to in this document, the values were different than when a different method that was reported by Sensabaugh was used, which is a hanging electrode type of method/ and so it points out that, first of all, those values aren't absolute.

The other thing that I noted as I reviewed it earlier is that for some of the data that's presented here, X don't think that the differences amongst the data points are analytically meaningful. Within pH, there can be quite a bit of variability just from any given measurement technique, and so this is just a point unto itself as I reviewed the document.

The other is that, again, any differences that may have been observed here were not differences that were meaningful to the way in which someone may have smoked a cigarette and they're not differences that necessarily would have been maintained comparing these cigarettes under a regimen that were

representative of the ways in which

people smoked.

That being said, the technique that

was available at the time was

investigated and there were correlations

done, it looks like, from this document. BY MR. VINIK:

Q. At this time in the early 1970's, R. J. Reynolds believed that unbound nicotine was more active physiologically, right?

A. I don't know that R. J. Reynolds Tobacco believed that. Some scientists may well have believed that and the scientists that authored this may have believed that.

Q.    May have believed that? Isn't that what they said?

Look at page 2 under "Free or unbound nicotine."

I'm sorry, page 3 under "Free or unbound nicotine."

A. It suggests that these authors had the view, rightly or wrongly, that it may be a partial measure of physiological strength of the cigarette.

Q. Well, the paragraph says, "As the

smoke pH is increased, the amount of free

nicotine in the smoke increases," right? A. That's the first sentence, yes. Q. Wasn't that the view of R. J.

Reynolds at the time, R. J. Reynolds'

research department?

MR. KREINER: Objection to the form.

THE WITNESS: I don't know that that was the view of the department at that time. I think that scientists within the department were aware of the presentation that had been made by Dr. Hoffmann and Dr. Brunnemann at the Tobacco Science Research Conference, I would expect the publication by Dr. Murray, and so they understood the concept.  I think that the scientists also, at least some scientists I would expect, understood that the concept of unbound nicotine was based on solution chemistry concepts and not the concept of a smoke aerosol.

A. In the United States, the greatest share of the cigarette market would be held by Philip Morris.

Q. And what share of the cigarette market do they have?

A. Approximately 50 percent.

Q.  Is it your intention at trial to testify with regard to Reynolds1 market share or financial data?

A.  I may offer factual testimony in terms of information that's available on the corporate website.

Q.  Including information with regard to financial data?

A. Generally other than things related to, for example, the amount of money that has been paid for the MSA or the cost of cigarettes, for example, and how much of that is taxes.  It wouldn't be to the company financial data.

Q. What are your opinions with regard to the MSA?

A. I don't expect to offer any expert opinion. These would be facts if I were to offer information in that regard.

Q. Is there a reason why you are the right person at R. J. Reynolds to testify about the magnitude over time of the MSA payments?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. BY MR. VINIK:

Q, Are you the one at Reynolds who is the most knowledgeable about that?

A. This is information that's available on our website.  I am familiar with our website.  I am not the only one that knows this information.

Q. So any employee that has familiarity with your website could testify about this topic?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. You're not a particular expert in the topic of MSA payments?

A. No.

Q. What would you testify to with regard  specifically with regard to the

Q.  So you would just testify with regard to what's on the website, nothing else?

A. Yes.

Q. The other financial things that you would testify to, are they also just things that are on the website?

A. Yes.

Q. So basically, you read the website and you can tell the jury what's on the website?

A. I have read the website. I've also had interaction with other individuals within the company. So I'm knowledgeable in these areas to where I've understood certain facts. But generally the website, yes.

A. They have been specifically to understand certain facts, yes.

Q. What testimony would you be prepared to give regarding the cost of cigarettes?

A. I would be prepared to offer the average price of a pack of cigarettes within the State of Florida, and in terms of the price of a pack of cigarettes, the proportion of that that goes to the materials that make the cigarette, to MSA payments, to various taxes and so on, information that's available on our website.

Q. Are you prepared to testify with regard to the profit per pack?

A. Yes, I am.

Q.    what is the profit per pack that R. J. Reynolds makes for cigarettes sold in the State of Florida?

A. Currently, that would be 40 cents per pack.

number of profits or revenue or any one of those numbers? Do you have a figure in mind of what percentage is R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company or Reynolds American owned any venture?

A. Reynolds Tobacco Company would be a significant part of Reynolds American. In terms of the employees, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company has probably now about 3,500 to 4,000 employees. So it would be a significant  perhaps the largest part, although currently, the Reynolds American company has operating companies and has certain service companies or activities, so there are some things that are provided across the companies that are general services. So overall, I would expect that more than half of the employees of Reynolds American are R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company employees.

In terms of contributions to the overall revenues, I would expect R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to be perhaps the largest part of that.

A.  Yes, they were.

Q. Okay. And did Reynolds follow that guidance?

A. Yes.

Q.    Let's talk a little bit about what Reynolds did. Earlier, you referred to general reduction with respect to cigarettes and cigarette design.

Can you remind us what "general reduction" refers to?

A.  "General reduction" refers to a technology that would reduce tar and nicotine, so it would reduce all of the compounds in the particulate phase of smoke as compared to selective reduction, which focuses on very specific individual compounds.

Q. Okay. You were asked a few questions that made reference to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and tobacco specific nitrosamines. Would general reduction affect those compounds as well?

A. Yes.

Q. In what way would those affect those compounds?

A.  They would be reduced generally in proportion to the reductions in tar.

Q. Can you summarize for us or identify the major general reduction techniques that R. J. Reynolds research and development implemented into its cigarettes since the 1950's?

A. Some of the major general reduction techniques included the addition of filters to non-filtered cigarettes, the research and development around various filter designs that increased the filtration efficiency of the filter, so the development of higher efficiency filters, the incorporation of faster burning cigarette paper, and later on, high porosity cigarette paper, the incorporation of reconstituted tobacco sheet, the incorporation of expanded tobacco and the incorporation of filter ventilation. These are examples of general reduction techniques.

Q. And do each of those techniques affect a reduction in tar, nicotine and carcinogens in cigarette smoke?

A. Yes.

Q. Were each of those techniques

implemented into the Winston and Salem cigarettes smoked by Mr. Hiott?

A.  Yes.

Q. You were asked some questions about reconstituted tobacco sheet, Dr. Borgerding. To be clear, does Reynolds add any extra nicotine to reconstituted tobacco sheet?

A.  No.

MR. VINIK: Objection. BY MR. KREINER:

Q. Has Reynolds ever added extra nicotine to the reconstituted tobacco sheet that was incorporated into the Winston and Salem cigarettes smoked by Mr. Hiott?

A. No.

Q. All else being equal, if Reynolds did not incorporate reconstituted tobacco sheet into its cigarettes, would the standardized machine smoking tar and nicotine yields be higher or lower?

MR. VINIK: Objection.

Q. All else being equal, if Reynolds had not incorporated expanded tobacco sheet into its cigarettes in place of tobacco lamina, would the machine smoking yields of tar, nicotine and carcinogens in its cigarettes be higher or lower?

A. If it had not been incorporated, they would be higher.

Q. Let's talk a little bit about the expanded tobacco process. Who invented expanded tobacco?

A. A scientist at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

invented by a scientist at Reynolds?

A. He would have reported on that and done that development work in the mid 1960's to late 1960's.

Q. And as part of the research and development of expanded tobacco, did Reynolds test the chemistry and biological activity of expanded tobacco?

A. Yes.

Q.    And what were the results in general of those tests?

A. The results in general were that cigarettes with the incorporation of expanded tobacco had reduced chemistry and reduced biological activity*

Q. The techniques that you referred to earlier that had been incorporated into Winston and Salem, specifically filters, more efficient filters, faster burning paper, more porous cigarette paper, reconstituted tobacco sheet, expanded tobacco and filter ventilation, were those techniques also evaluated by entities outside of R. J. Reynolds?

A. Yes, they were.

244 Q. Were those techniques evaluated to

assess their effect on tar, nicotine and

carcinogens in cigarette smoke?

A. Yes, they were. They were evaluated by the federal government and by a working group.

Q. Let me ask you, are you familiar with something called the National Cancer Institute Tobacco Working Group?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. What is that program?

A. That was a program that started in the 1960's and the final report issued about 1980, I believe. There were four reports and a fifth summary report.

But the purpose of that was to evaluate various types of technologies that had the potential to reduce the yields of tar and nicotine and toxicants in smoke, to look not only at if those yields were reduced, but the biological activity of the smoke and to see if there were ways to make a safer cigarette.

MR. VINIK: Objection.

MR. KREINER: What's the nature of

the objection?

MR. VINIK: Lack of foundation. BY MR. KREINER:

Q. Doctor, are you familiar with the National Cancer Institute Tobacco Working Group research?

A. Yes, I am.

Q. You've indicated they have issued reports. Do you know how many reports they issued?

A. They issued four technical reports and a fifth summary report.

Q. Have you reviewed those reports?

A. Yes, I have.

Q. Have you included them on your reliance list?

A. Yes.

Q.    Back to my question. Can you

summarize for us what the National Cancer Institute Tobacco Working Group concluded with respect to the general reduction techniques that you've listed for us with respect to those techniques' effect on the yields of tar, nicotine and carcinogens in cigarette smoke?

A. They reached the conclusion that quite a number of techniques had the ability to reduce the yields of tar and nicotine, and also a number of the techniques, including the techniques, major techniques that we have discussed throughout the questions and answers today had the potential to reduce the biological activity in the smoke.

Q. Doctor, I want to switch and talk about selective reduction. You mentioned that earlier. What is selective reduction?

A. Cigarette smoke is a complex chemical mixture. Over the course of 60 years, there have been many thousands of compounds identified and reported in cigarette smoke.

Selective reduction is the concept of trying to reduce or eliminate specific

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

compounds within the complex chemical mixture.  So from an objective standpoint, that is, from the standpoint of a goal, it's sort of like the needle in the haystack. It may be trying to develop a technology to remove a single or very few compounds that are present at billionths of a gram within the material to try and reduce the biological activity of the material.

Q. Has Reynolds researched select reduction as a means to potentially reduce the risk of cigarette smoking?

A. Yes.

Q. When did that research begin, the selective reduction?

A.  In the 1950's.

Q. what was the first compounds or class of compounds that were of interest to R. J. Reynolds?

A. Benzo apyrene and other selected polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons.

Q. And why were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including BAP, of interest to R. J. Reynolds to attempt to selectively reduce in the 1950's?

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

248

A. Because they had been reported to be compounds that had biological activity, they were compounds that had been studied in industrial pollution, they had been compounds that were reported to be part of the possible biological activity of cigarette smoke.

Q. And the reports that you are referring to, are these internal reports to R. J. Reynolds or were these external reports available to the public, including the scientific and government community?

A. They were available to the  in the scientific literature to all scientists.

Q. Doctor, could you get in front of you Exhibit 13, please?

Doctor, you were asked some questions about Exhibit 13. Let me orient us for the record. This is a September 28, 1956 RER by Alan Rodgman, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. The title of it is, "The Analysis of Cigarette Smoke Condensate I, the Isolation and/or Identification of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Camel Cigarette Smoke Condensate," correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If you could turn to page number 37 where you were asked questions earlier by counsel for Mr. Hiott.

A. I am there.

Q. You were read at least the beginning of this paragraph, I'm not sure you were read the whole thing, but regardless, I am going to read it. "Since it is now well established that cigarette smoke does contain several polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and considering the potential and actual carcinogenic activity of a number of these compounds, a method of either complete removal or almost complete removal of these compounds from cigarette smoke is required." Do you see that?

A. Yes, again, with the same qualification, that a few of those words are obscured.  It may well say that, but I can't read every word.

Q. They are obscured by the watermark that was affixed to the document?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Reynolds, in fact, investigate

methods to attempt to either completely remove or almost completely remove polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons/ including Benzo apyrene, from the smoke of its cigarettes?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that a reference to selective reduction?

A. Yes*

Q. Was that a minor effort at R. J. Reynolds?

A. No.

Q. Can you briefly summarize for us, Dr. Borgerding, some of the approaches that Reynolds took to attempt to reduce polycyclics, including Benzo apyrene, from the smoke of its cigarettes?

A. Some of the techniques were  that were investigated were using different types of solvent extraction, looking at the incorporation of catalytic materials, trying to remove precursors of PAH's from the tobacco, and then, in addition, of course, all of the general reduction techniques.

Q.    To be clear, do the general reduction techniques that Reynolds has

incorporated into the cigarettes, including Winston and Salem, affect the yields of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, including Benzo apyrene?

A. Yes.

Q. How do they effect the yields of PAH's and BAP?

A. They were generally reduced in proportion to the tar reduction.

Q. Is Benzo apyrene the only compound in cigarette smoke that Reynolds has attempted to selectively reduce over the years?

A. Mo.

Q. Are you familiar with the class of compounds called phenols?

A.  I am, yes.

Q. Has Reynolds attempted to selectively reduce phenols from cigarette smoke?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Reynolds identify any means that were successful in selectively reducing the yields of phenols from its cigarettes?

A. Yes.

Q. Would you please describe for us Reynolds' research in that regard?

A. Reynolds1 research in that regard identified the fact that cellulose acetate in the filter was selective for phenols as well as triacetin plasticizer within cellulose acetate had a selectively for phenolic compounds.

Q. And did Reynolds incorporate cellulose acetate filters with triacetin plasticizers into Winston cigarettes?

A. Yes.

Q,  Including the Winston cigarettes that Mr. Hiott would have smoked?

A.  Yes.

Q. Did Reynolds incorporate its cellulose acetate filters with triacetin plasticizer into Salem cigarettes?

A. Yes.

Q.  Including the Salem cigarettes smoked by Mr. Hiott?

A. Yes.

Q. You were also asked some questions about tobacco specific nitrosamines, abbreviated TSNA's. Do you recall that?

Q. Has Reynolds attempted to selectively reduce TSNA's from the smoke of its cigarettes?

A. Yes.

Q. Has Reynolds been successful?

A. Yes.

Q. Will you describe that research for us?

A. TSNA's are compounds that are present in tobacco and Reynolds has had an extensive research effort with flue cured tobacco to try and understand the source of the tobacco specific nitrosamines. So in the green the tobacco leaf, there is not TSNA present, but it was found through research that upon curing, TSNA's are present, and Reynolds conducted extensive studies and ultimately determined that the source of TSNA formation was one of the reactives, one of the materials required to form or produce the compounds, something called oxides of nitrogen, and that these were being introduced into the tobacco curing barn as part of the curing produce.

So Reynolds, first of all, upon identifying this as a possible mechanism, conducted research to verify that that was indeed the basis of the formation, they identified an alternative means of providing heat for the flue curing process, and they were successful through that research in reducing TSNA's in flue cured tobacco by 90 percent or more.

Reynolds made that information available to farmers, to scientists, to the government, to other countries and now flue cured tobacco in cigarettes in the United States has greatly reduced amounts of tobacco specific nitrosamines as compared to in the past.

Q.  To be clear, the formation of TSNA's and flue cured tobacco, was that a result of something Reynolds was doing or a result of something the farmers were doing during the curing of tobacco?

A. That was the result of the ways that the farmers were producing heat within the curing barn.

Q. And you told us Reynolds identified

255

that mechanism and came up with an alternative to curing that resulted in the reduction of TSNA's, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Reynolds assist farmers in converting their barns to this new curing technology?

A. Yes, they did.

Q. Let's switch to another means that you identified that Reynolds has tried to reduce the risk of its products. You referred to tobacco heating technology, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Will you explain to us briefly the theory behind tobacco heating as a potential way to reduce the risks of smoking?

A. Again, mainstream cigarette smoke is a complex chemical mixture. As I indicated in an earlier answer, there are thousands of compounds that have been identified through the cumulative research of many decades.

In terms of the formation of those compounds, when tobacco is burned to form

mainstream smoke, one of the mechanisms by which smoke is formed is something known as pyrolysis. This is where molecules that are present in tobacco are broken down into smaller molecules, in other words, there's incomplete combustion of the material. And so by producing smoke without burning tobacco, the compounds that are formed from pyrolysis, from pyrosynthesis and so on are greatly reduced or eliminated and you produce a much simpler smoke.

Q. You referred earlier to Premier cigarettes and that that development of that product took place during the 1980's, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Were you involved in research on Premier?

A. Yes, I was.

Q. And you had indicated that at that time, R and D expanded to somewhere between 6 and 800 scientists?

A. That's my estimate. On that order of magnitude. I don't know the exact number.

Q. Earlier you referred to Reynolds

having spent a billion dollars on tobacco heating technology since the 1980's; is that correct?

MR. VINIK: Objection.

MR. KREINER: Basis?

MR. VINIK: That's just not

accurate. His testimony was  that's

not what he said. BY MR. KREINER:

Q.  Doctor, how much has Reynolds spent on tobacco heating technology since the early 1980's when it first started working on it?

A. More than a billion dollars.

Q.  Is Reynolds still working on tobacco heating cigarettes today?

A. Yes.

Q. Let's talk about Premier. Will you briefly describe how the Premier cigarette worked?

A. Yes. The Premier cigarette was a cigarette that looked like other cigarettes. It was a cigarette that contained a highly refined carbon heat source on the end of the cigarette that was lit. That highly refined carbon heat source was  the end of it was

within an aluminum capsule that contained alumina substrate. That substrate would have glycerol and sprayed dried tobacco present on it. And that would be followed by a tobacco paper and by a polypropylene filter in terms of the general elements of the cigarette*

In terms of how the cigarette was smoked, one end was placed in the mouth, the other end that contained the highly refined heat source was lit. The only part of the cigarette that burned was the heat source that produced heat. That heat, in turn, volatilized the glycerol that was present in the substrate along with tobacco flavors and nicotine as well, and that formed a very simple smoke aerosol that was puffed out of the cigarette. The cigarette had virtually no sidestream smoke and the only environmental tobacco smoke would have been from exhaled mainstream smoke and perhaps a very small amount of sidestream smoke.

So while the cigarette looked like other cigarettes generally, it was, as I indicated in an earlier answer, more difficult to light, it had a different odor

and it did not burn down in length when it was consumed.

Q. Will you remind us what the design objectives were for the Premier cigarette?

A. The design objectives were to develop a commercially acceptable cigarette that had a much simpler mainstream smoke composition, a much simpler mainstream smoke aerosol, that had reduced biological activity and that had greatly reduced or eliminated environmental tobacco smoke.

Q.    Was Reynolds successful in achieving its design objectives for Premier?

A. Yes.

Q,    Did Reynolds evaluate the chemistry of the smoke generated by the Premier?

A. Yes.

Q.    How did the yields of constituents in the smoke of Premier, including compounds that have been classified as carcinogens, compare to those from a tobacco burning cigarette?

A. They were greatly reduced compared to tobacco burning cigarettes.

Q. And would that include the

compounds we discussed earlier, Benzo apyrene phenols and nitrosamines?

A. Yes, and many others as well.

Q.    Did Reynolds also assess the biological activity of the smoke from Premier as part of its research and development?

A. Yes.

Q. And how does the biological activity of the smoke from Premier compare to that of tobacco burning cigarettes?

A. The biological activity of the smoke from Premier was greatly reduced. In many biological tests, it was not elevated compared to control, that compared to other cigarettes, it was greatly reduced.

Q. Did Reynolds obtain any patents on the technology that went into the Premier cigarettes?

A. Yes.

Q. Do you know approximately how many?

A. Approximately 40 patents for the cigarette design, the design of equipment to produce the cigarette. 40 patents, roughly.

Q. Did scientists from Reynolds make presentations at scientific conferences

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

regarding their research on Premier?

A.  Yes.

Q. Did scientists from Reynolds publish in peer reviewed literature regarding research that it had conducted on Premier?

A. Yes.

Q. Did R. J. Reynolds prepare a book summarizing the chemical and biological research it had conducted on Premier?

A. Yes.

Q. Is that sometimes referred to as the Premier monograph?

A. It is.

Q. You told us that Premier was not consumer acceptable, correct?

A. That's correct.

Q. After withdrawing Premier from the test market in 1989, as you testified earlier, did Reynolds give up on tobacco heating technology as a way to potentially reduce risk?

A. No.

Q. What was the next efforts that Reynolds undertook with respect to tobacco heating technology?

A. The effort that Reynolds undertook after Premier was  the scientific question was how to have a product that would be more acceptable and yet focused on the same objectives, and ultimately, that research led to a product known as Eclipse.

Q. And did you personally work on the Eclipse cigarette?

A.  Yes, I did.

Q. Again, briefly, can you tell us how Eclipse works, in particular, how it was different from Premier, despite the fact that they were both tobacco heating cigarettes?

A. The Eclipse cigarette, in terms of the design of the cigarette, was different in quite of number of ways. While there was still a heat source at the end of the cigarette that was lit, the Eclipse cigarette did not contain the aluminum capsule, the alumina substrate, sprayed dried tobacco and so on.  Instead, it contained two sections of tobacco column or tobacco roll. One of those sections contained a significant amount of glycerol as compared to the other.

The concepts or the principals were

much the same as with Premier in that primarily, tobacco is heated rather than burned, but one of the differences between the two cigarette designs is that Eclipse is intended to burn some tobacco in and around the heat source and this is intended to provided some additional taste and flavor. And so the cigarette was different in that regard.

Other differences included, for example, the nature of the filter. The filter in Eclipse is a cellulose acetate based filter rather than polypropylene. But, again, the fundamental difference in concept is that Eclipse primarily heats but does some burn tobacco, whereas Premier only heated tobacco.

Q. Did Reynolds test the smoke chemistry of Eclipse?

A.  Yes.

Q. And how did the chemistry, including the yields of carcinogens, compare between Eclipse and tobacco burning cigarettes?

A. Compared to other cigarettes, the

yields with Eclipse were greatly reduced,

Q.  Did Reynolds assess the biological activity of the smoke from the Eclipse cigarette?

A.  Yes.

Q, How did the biological activity from the smoke of Eclipse compare to the biological activity of the smoke from tobacco burning cigarettes?

A.  Consistent with the simpler smoke chemistry, the biological activity was greatly reduced.

Q.  Did Reynolds also conduct studies with smokers of Eclipse?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Are you familiar with something called a quality of life study at R. J. Reynolds?

A.  Yes, I am.

Q.  Did that include an evaluation of Eclipse?

A.  It did, yes.

Q. What were the results of the quality of life study for those people who switched to the Eclipse cigarette from the

tobacco burning cigarette?

A.  The results of the quality of life study were that when smokers of  that had a usual brand of cigarette that was a burn down cigarette, when they were switched to Eclipse for 24 weeks, they had greatly reduced exposure to a number of biomarkers of exposure and some biomarkers of effect.  The exposure reduction in terms of the biomarkers of exposure indicated that their exposure to a number of carcinogens was significantly decreased.

Q. Did Reynolds obtain any patents on any of the technology that went into the Eclipse cigarette?

A. Yes.

Q. Did Reynolds publish either in the peer reviewed literature or present at scientific conferences on its research on the Eclipse cigarette?

A.  Yes.

Q. Was Eclipse introduced into the commercial market?

A. Yes, it was.

A.  It was introduced in the year 1996.

Q.  Is Eclipse still available today for sale?

A. Yes, it is.

Q,    How is it doing?

A.  It does not have a large market share,

Q. Does Reynolds make any money on the sale of Eclipse?

A. No, we do not.

Q.  I am going to switch topics, but before we do, I do want to go back to Exhibit 13, which is Dr. Rodgman's RDR from 1956 that we were discussing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Do you have that in front of you, Doctor?

A.  I do.

Q. The fact that cigarette smoke contained polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, was that something only known to R. J. Reynolds in 1956?

A. No, it was not.

Q.  If you can turn to page 11 of the document for me, Doctor, of Exhibit 13, Table

I.

A.  I'm there.

Q.    The title of the table is "Polycyclic Hydrocarbons in Cigarette Smoke and Cigarette Paper Smoke Condensate." Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes, you did.

Q. What is your understanding of what this table portrays with respect to research of those outside of Reynolds on polycyclic hydrocarbons in either cigarette smoke or cigarette paper smoke condensate?

A. My understanding of Table I is that there has been research reported by several different scientists in terms of PAH's that had been identified in cigarette smoke condensate or cigarette paper tar.

Q.    And this research that was published external to Reynolds was done before Dr. Rodgman's work in 1956?

A.  Yes.

memo entitled, "The Winston Problem"; is that correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  When you were being asked questions about this document, you made reference to the effect of ammonia on the level of pyrazines and pyridines in smoke.  Do you recall that?

A. Yes.

Q.  If you could turn to page 2 of the document. The indented paragraph under the fifth bullet point that starts with the word "incorporation," are you there?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You were read the first half of that paragraph.  I want to read the paragraph in its entirety.  "Incorporation of ammoniated tobacco materials into a blend usually, but not always, increases smoke pH; decreases harshness/irritancy by reducing levels of aldehydes, ketones, acids, et cetera in the smoke; increases flavor by increasing the levels of such known flavorful smoke components as the pyrazines," period.

A.  Yes.

Q.     Is the reference to increase in flavorful compounds such as pyrazines consistent with your prior testimony as to effect of ammonia in reconstituted tobacco sheet?

A. Yes, it is.

Q. You were asked about the handwriting that appears just to the left of that paragraph.  I would like to read that into the record, and please let me know if I've read it accurately.  "I think change was due to change in flue cured grades, not G7A." Did I read that accurately?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Dr. Borgerding, you said you have been at Reynolds for more than 30 years, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Have you ever seen a document or heard someone at R. J. Reynolds say that Reynolds was making a change to either Winston or Salem for the purpose of making that cigarette more addictive?

A. No.

Q. When Reynolds is evaluating potential changes to its commercial products like Winston and Salem, is inhalability a test that is run?

A.  No.

Q.  Doctor, you made reference to Winston switching to a no additive, no tobacco additive blend, and I want the record to be clear.  Did that occur in the 1980's or did that occur in the 1990's?

occurred in the 1980's.  Are you revising that testimony?

A.  X am, X misspoke.

Q. You were asked some questions about menthol, Dr. Borgerding, and whether that made cigarettes easier to inhale. Will you remind us what your opinion is in that regard?

question. BY MR. KREINER:

Q.  Go ahead, Doctor.

A. My opinion is that menthol is there as a flavor, it's something that provides a particular taste signature, that all cigarette smoke is inhalable and that it's not there for that purpose, nor does it change the inhalability of the aerosol.

Q. Are you generally familiar, Dr. Borgerding, with the epidemiological research that compares smokers of non-menthol cigarettes to smokers of menthol cigarettes?

A.  Generally, yes.

Q. And based on your recollection and review of that literature, is there a difference in the rate of lung cancer between smokers of menthol cigarettes and non-menthol cigarettes?

A.  I don't recall that there is.  If there was, it may have been slightly  I don't recall that there was.  It may have been slightly less for mentholated cigarettes.

Q.    I want to switch topics with you. You were asked some questions regarding Reynolds' viewpoints about whether smoking was a cause of disease, and I want to follow up in that regard.

Can you explain for us what Reynolds * historical position on causation has been over time and the basis for that position?

A.  I think Reynolds' position has been that they recognize that there has been a statistical association that there has been a greater incidence of risk for smoking-related diseases for people that smoke as compared to

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424        www.veritext.com

those that do not smoke,  I think that scientists at Reynolds were classically trained, those that were employed in the 1950's and beyond, from the '50's and ' 60's and so on, and that part of what they were taught in terms of their education is that a statistical study indicates the possibility of association but does not provide a mechanism that would demonstrate causation.

This isn't something that was limited to Reynolds' scientists, it was something that was true of other scientists as well, they were trained in this regard.

In terms of mechanism, understanding a mechanism is important because it tells you not only that there is a possibility, but the how and the why at a molecular level that something might happen. As importantly, or perhaps more importantly, it provides a basis to understand what to change about the product, if indeed there is a cause and effect relationship, to change the product in a positive direction.

So the mechanism was something that was very important to Reynolds' scientists

for many years. Also, the types of biological essays that were available.  Even the scientists that conducted the very first skin painting studies acknowledged that mouse skin may not be the most direct or appropriate model of what would be relevant to man* This was also put forward by the National Cancer Institute, again, during the *60's and *70's when that work was done. Part of the effort was focused on developing an inhalation model rather than a dermal promotion model or a dermal skin painting model. Again, because inhalation would be the general manner in which the product was going to be used or which smokers that did inhale would be exposed to smoke.  It also provided an inhalation model, that is, provided the opportunity to look at any effects more broadly that may have occurred due to exposure.

So some of the things that were of concern were having an appropriate model, having sufficient understanding around mechanism and so on to lead to the conclusion that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424        www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

pgNbr=274
275

Mechanism is still important.  In fact, the 2010 Surgeon General's report is about mechanisms of disease, smoking-related disease, and that report indicates that for the first time, we now understand the mechanisms of smoking-related disease.  It doesn't suggest that all of the research that needs to be conducted in that regard is complete.  It also states that it was appropriate without mechanism to  for the Surgeon General to reach the conclusions that the prior Surgeon General had arrived at.

That being said, though, it goes on to state in there that one of the reasons that mechanism is important is that it demonstrates not only the plausibility of something, but the fact there is an understanding of how and that it does  that there is a cause and effect.

So as I believe I indicated in an earlier answer, currently, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco's position is that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer and a number of other diseases, and that that is different than in the past.  That difference is driven by a

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424        www.veritext.com        (212) 490-3430

change in our understanding in a number of ways, all of the additional information that's been gathered over the decades in terms of the biological activity of smoke, in terms of the statistical or epidemiology studies, but also in terms of the training of the scientists that now are the scientists in the department.

Q. As someone who has spent much of your 30-plus years at Reynolds on research with the objective to try and reduce the risk of smoking, would an inhalation model and would a mechanism by which smoking causes disease be important to you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Why is that?

A. Again, as I indicated in my earlier answer, it would provide a definitive direction about how to change the product, how to reduce the risks of the product. And the concept of what drives the biological activity of cigarette smoke has evolved over the decades, and Reynolds responded to the various hypotheses that have been put forth, has used techniques such as general reduction

277

to reduce the yields of all of the various compounds, but, again, especially from a selective reduction standpoint, if we were able to identify the single compound or the very few compounds that drove the activity, this would help research efforts to be very, very focused upon those.  From my reading of the literature in the 1950's, I think somewhat naively, scientists, even those that did the original studies, felt that there were a small number of compounds, that one of the best uses of the dermal promotion or the mouse painting essay would be to try and look at different fractions and identify compounds that had biological activity such that they could be reduced or eliminated.

Q. Were there scientists and public health authorities in the 1950's outside of R. J. Reynolds who did not believe that it had been proven that smoking caused disease?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Can you give us an example?

A.  I believe that Dr. Hooper, for example, would be one such individual.  There were a number of different individuals.

A.  Yes.

Q.    You were asked some questions about CPS1 earlier.  Do you know whether Dr. Hammond was involved in CPS1?

A. Yes.

Q.  If you look in the left-hand corner, the very first question Dr. Hammond is asked, and X will read this, "Question: Does smoking really cause lung cancer, Dr. Hammond? People are saying all sorts of things about cigarette smoking.

"Answer:  That's just what we are trying to find out.  There is some evidence that it may be so, for example, material collected from cigarettes will produce cancer on the skin of a susceptible mouse if you keep up the experiment long enough.  That's an important piece of information, but taken alone, it doesn't prove a thing about the occurrence of lung cancer in human beings. It has to be weighed together with other evidence, and we are still collecting

information."

Did I read that accurately?

A.  Yes.

Q. Was this information that R. J. Reynolds was aware of in the 1950's?

A.  Yes.

Q. Dr. Borgerding, in your 30-plus years, including your involvement in litigation in more recent years, have you ever seen a document or heard a discussion at Reynolds that led you to believe that a public statement by someone associated with Reynolds was not consistent with what they believed individually?

A. No.

Q,    You were asked some questions about the Waxman hearings in 1994. Are you aware of any documents or have heard any discussions internally at R. J. Reynolds that the views expressed by the CEO, James Johnston, with respect to nicotine were not his good faith beliefs?

A. No.

Q.  Doctor, would you get Exhibit 9, please?

Doctor, you have Exhibit 9 in front of you?

A.  I do, yes.

Q. Do you recall that this is a scene shot from one of the pages on R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's website?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Just for the record, the title is "Making Decisions Regarding Tobacco Use."

You recall you were asked some questions about Reynolds referring individuals to various reports of the Surgeon General and others.  Do you recall that?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If you will turn to the second page, which  if you flip it over, which is a continuation of the page, and look at the last paragraph, last sentence.  It says, "The statement and views available on those sites do not necessarily represent the views of R. J. Reynolds or its management."

Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes, you did.

Q. Does Reynolds necessarily agree with everything that's ever been written in a

Surgeon General's report?

A.  No.

Q.  Despite that fact, Reynolds still tells smokers that they should refer to those reports regarding decisions that they make regarding tobacco use, right?

A.  Yes.

Q. If you turn back to the front page, Doctor, there's a section called, "Cigarette Warning Labels."

Based on your review of the case specific materials, when did Mr. Hiott begin smoking?

A. Mr. Hiott began smoking in 1967.

Q. Were there warning labels on packages of cigarettes prior to 1967?

A. Yes.

Q.  When did that start?

A. That was required beginning in 1965 and they appeared by 1966.

Q.  Let's go through some of this. Under the "Cigarette Warning Labels," let me read this for you, Doctor:  "Health warning labels have been required to appear on all cigarette packages sold in the United States

for more than 40 years."

Did I read that accurately?

A.  Yes.

Q. And is that a correct statement, to your understanding?

A.  It is, yes.

Q. The next sentence, "The Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 required the following health warning prescribed by Congress to be placed on all cigarette packages sold in the United States: Caution: Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health."

Did I read that accurately?

A.  You did, yes.

Q.  By 1967, when Mr. Hiott started smoking, would that warning label have appeared on every package of cigarettes he picked up between 1967 and 1970?

A.  Yes.

Q. Skipping down a little bit, it says, "In 1969, the Public Health Smoking Act of 1969 required all cigarette packaging contain the statement: Warning: The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424        www.veritext.com

is dangerous to your health."

Did I read that accurately?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Starting in 1970 and moving up to 1985, would every package of cigarettes that Mr. Hiott picked up have contained that warning?

A.  Yes.

Q. Skipping down a little further, "The Comprehensive Smoking Education Act of 1984 amended the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act by requiring cigarette manufacturers and importers to display on a quarterly rotating basis the following four health warnings on all cigarette packages." Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes.

Q.     I want to focus just on one of the warnings, the one in the lower left.  It says, "Surgeon General's Warning:  Smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema and may complicate pregnancy."

Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes, you did.

Q.    Every cigarette package that

Mr, Hiott picked up starting in 1985 would have contained one of the rotating warnings, including the one we just read?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Can you get deposition Exhibit 10 for me, Doctor, which is another page of the Reynolds' website.

Just to orient us, Dr. Borgerding, deposition Exhibit 10 is a screen shot from one of the pages of R. J. Reynolds' website?

A.  Yes.

Q.  I want to start on the page that has at the top, "Guiding Principles and Beliefs, Balancing the Desires of Our Stakeholders."

Are you there with me?

A.  I am, yes.

Q. If you will skip down to the section labeled, "Tobacco Use & Health," I want to go through some of the statements that Reynolds puts on its website to the public.

First bullet.  "Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of preventable deaths in the United States.  Cigarette smoking

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424        www.veritext.com

286

significantly increases the risk of developing lung cancer, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and other serious diseases and adverse health conditions."

Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes.

Q.  Is that statement consistent with what you understand to be the message by the public health community today with respect to the risks of smoking?

A.  Yes, it is.

Q.  If you could skip down to the third bullet point.  "No tobacco product has been shown to be safe and without risks." Did I read that accurately?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is that statement consistent with your understanding of what the public health community message is with respect to tobacco products?

A.  Yes.

Q.  The next bullet point says, "Nicotine in tobacco products is addictive but is not considered a significant threat to

health."

Did I read that accurately?

A.  Yes.

Q. The statement that nicotine in tobacco products is addictive, is that consistent with your understanding of the public health community's message with respect to addiction?

A.  Yes.

Q.  The phrase, "But is not considered a significant threat to health," would you explain to us what Reynolds means by that statement?

A. Yes, the biological activity of nicotine has been studied.  Nicotine, in terms of, for example, nicotine replacement therapy products is something that's been approved for the FDA for smokers to use when they choose that as a means of stopping smoking. And so, again, the biological activity of nicotine is quite minimal in most regards, the risks of smoking, the risk for smoking-related disease comes from other toxicants within the smoke and not from nicotine.

Q.  Under the section, "Tobacco Consumers," the first bullet point, "Individuals should consider the conclusions of the U.S. Surgeon General, the Centers For Disease Control and other public health and medical officials when making decisions regarding smoking."

Did I read that accurately?

A.  Yes.

Q, is that what Reynolds is telling tobacco consumers today?

A. Yes.

Q.  The next bullet point, the first sentence, "The best course of action for tobacco consumers concerned about their health is to quit."

Did I read that accurately?

A. You did, yes.

Q. Is that what Reynolds is telling tobacco consumers today?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If you skip down under, "Harm Reduction," the second bullet point, "Significant reductions in the harm associated with the use of cigarettes can be

achieved by providing accurate information regarding the comparative risks of tobacco products to adult tobacco consumers, thereby encouraging smokers to migrate to the use of smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products and, and by developing new smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products and other actions." Did I read that correctly?

A.  Yes.

Q. Are you familiar with a concept at R. J. Reynolds that's referred to as migration?

A. Yes.

Q. Will you explain to the jury the concept of migration and what Reynolds is hoping to achieve?

A. Yes. The concept migration is that Reynolds would like smokers that are concerned about the risks of smoking and that do not wish to stop using tobacco to consider non-combustible forms of tobacco.  Through research that's been conducted over an extended period of time, it's clear that the risks for smoking-related diseases is greatly reduced for products that don't combust the

(212) 490-3430

CO 4>pgNbr=290
291

tobacco, and so the concept is to reduce harm within the population for those that are concerned about risk by moving them from a combustible product to a non-combustible tobacco product.

Q. Does Reynolds manufacture and sell any non-combustible tobacco products?

A.  Yes.

Q. Can you give us an example?

A. An example of that would be a product called Camel Snus.

Q. And does Reynolds believe that Snus is a viable form of harm reduction for those adult tobacco consumers who choose to continue using  or for those adult cigarette smokers who choose to continue using tobacco products?

A. Yes.

Q. Why is a viable form of harm reduction for cigarette smokers?

A. It's a viable form of harm reduction because when using that product, no tobacco is burned, the toxicants associated with burning tobacco are not formed, and so reductions are greatly reduced  or

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY (212) 279-9424        www.veritext.com        (212) 490-3430

pgNbr=291
292

exposures, rather, are greatly reduced.

Also, there has been epidemiology research that's been conducted that shows the risks for smoking-related diseases is greatly reduced for those that use a non-combustible form of tobacco.

Q. And is Camel Snus available for adults to buy today?

A.  Yes, it is.

Q.  Is it available nationwide?

A.  Yes, it is.

Q.  Including in Florida?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You were asked some questions about Niconovum. What is Niconovum?

A. Niconovum is a company that is one of the companies within the Reynolds American group of companies, so it's a subsidiary of Reynolds American. We would typically refer to it as a sister company, a different company from R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. It's a company that was started in Sweden, and it's a company that produces nicotine replacement therapy products, so products that are intended to help smokers that would

293

like to quit, to stop smoking.

Q.     Examples of nicotine replacement therapy that the jury may be aware of include things like nicotine gum or the nicotine patch?

A. Yes, those are examples.

Q. Nicotine replacement therapies, do they require FDA approval in the United States?

A. Yes, they do.

Q.    Does Reynolds or Niconovum, to your knowledge, at least have a long-range plan to seek FDA approval and introduce those products in the U.S. market?

A.  Yes.

Q.    And to be clear, those products could be used by cigarette smokers to help them quit smoking, correct?

A. That's correct, yes.

1972 memo authored by Claude Teague entitled, "Research Planning Memorandum on the Mature of the Tobacco Business and the Crucial Role of Nicotine Therein."

Do you have that in front of you?

A. Yes.

Q.  Is this memo addressed to anyone, Doctor?

A. No, it's not.

Q. By virtue of your career at Reynolds and having been involved in some of the Engle cases in recent years, has anyone ever shown you a document to indicate that this memo was forwarded to anyone else in R. J. Reynolds?

A. No.

Q. With respect to deposition Exhibit 14 that we will get to in a minute, it was an RDM from 1973 that had a distribution list at the back of that memo.

Do you recall that?

A.  I do, yes.

A.  No.

Q. Research planning memorandum, is that a formal document recognized within R. J. Reynolds?

A. Not that I am aware of, no.

Q. Have you seen anyone else write a research planning memo besides Claude Teague?

A. No.

Q. You talked earlier that during this time in the early 1970's, the research department was separate from the development department. Do you recall that?

A. Yes.

Q. Which of the departments, research or development, was responsible for making changes to Reynolds, and implementing changes to Reynolds' commercial cigarette?

A. That would be the development department.

Q. Was Dr. Teague in the research department or the development department in April of 1972?

A. He was in the research department.

Q.    Do you see any indication that Dr. Teague sent his memo from the research

296

side over to the people who were actually working on Reynolds' commercial cigarettes?

A. No.

Q. You were asked some questions, Doctor, about the manipulation of nicotine or smoke pH, and I want to follow up that regard.

Among the efforts that Reynolds made to attempt to reduce the risk of smoking, did that include research into altering the tar-to-nicotine ratio?

A. Yes, it did.

Q. Will you describe for us the theory behind why changing the tar-to-nicotine ratio has the potential to reduce the risk of smoking?

A. Yes. The theory is sometimes referred to as the Russell hypothesis after some of the work put forward by Dr. Mike Russell. The theory was that nicotine was an important aspect of the smoking experience for smokers and that one way to have cigarettes with less harm associated with them, that is, reduced risk, would be a cigarette that would have a medium level of

topgNbr=296
297

nicotine but a low level of tar. And so, again, it recognized that nicotine was an important part of the smoking experience, but that the risks associated with cigarette smoking came from the constituents in the tar, and so that the general hypothesis was to maintain the nicotine and reduce tar.

Q. Did one aspect of that hypothesis include the suggestion to increase smoke pH?

A. Yes, it did.

MR. KREINER:  Let's mark this as

the next exhibit.

(Borgerding Exhibit 16 was marked

Q,  (Handing.)  Doctor, I have handed you what's been marked as deposition Exhibit 16. This is an article entitled, "Low-Risk Cigarettes: A Prescription," authored by Gio, G-I-O, B. Gori, G-O-R-I, dated 17 December, 1976.

Do you see that?

A. Yes, X do.

Q. Have you seen this article before, Doctor?

A. I believe I have, yes.

Q.  Is this, in fact, on your reliance materials for this case?

A. I believe so, yes.

Q. In the lower left corner of the first page, it says, "The author is the deputy director of the Division of Cancer Cause and Prevention and director of the Smoking and Health Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20014."

Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes.

Q. Earlier you referred to the National Cancer Institute Tobacco Working Group. Was Dr. Gori involved in that effort?

A. Yes, he was the individual that was responsible for leading those efforts.

Q. Did the National Cancer Institute Tobacco Working Group also include representatives from R. J. Reynolds and other tobacco companies?

A. Yes.

Q. If you will look with me, Doctor, on the right-hand column of the first page,

the second full paragraph, about ten lines down after reference number 28, I want to start reading beginning with the word "within." Please let me know when you are there.

A.  Second full paragraph, so the paragraph that begins with the word "because"?

Q.  Correct,

A. And which line again? I'm sorry.

Q. About ten lines down, after reference number 28, and starts with "within."

A.  Okay, I am there now.

Q. Let me read that.  "Within certain value ranges, high levels of nicotine, high smoke pH values and high ratios of unprotonated to protonated nicotine increased the satiation effect in the smoker, tend to depress the consumption of cigarettes and the depth and frequency of inhalation," and there's two references, "and therefore, reduced the intake of smoke.

"Thus, it appears that the hazards of cigarettes can be reduced by simultaneous

reduction of tar and of its specific carcinogenic activity, by a reduction of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, hydrogen cyanide, acrolein and other undesirable toxic smoke components, and by an adjustment of nicotine levels and protonation conducive to consumer satiation."

Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes.

Q, How does that tie in, including especially the reference to high smoke pH values, to the theory of reducing tar-and-nicotine ratio as a way to potentially reduce risk?

A. Again, it suggests that by having a medium nicotine level, by having even a higher pH, but by having a lower tar, that there1s a potential to have a cigarette that would be reduced in risk by reducing exposure to the compounds in smoke associated with smoking-related disease.

Q. And you mentioned that one of the proponents of this theory was a Dr. Mike Russell; is that correct?

A.  Yes.

Q. Was Dr. Russell affiliated with any cigarette company or R. J. Reynolds in any way?

A. No.

Q. We just saw an article by Dr. Gori. He was at the NCITWG, correct?

A. Correct.

Q. Are other public health authorities also advocating reducing the tar-and-nicotine ratio as a way to potentially reduce risk?

A. None that come immediately to mind.

Q. Do you know if the Surgeon General has spoken to reducing the tar-to-nicotine ratio as a way to potentially reduce risk?

A. Yes, the Surgeon General has indicated the same thing.

Q. Has Reynolds researched trying to reduce the tar-to-nicotine ratio?

A. Yes.

Q.    And has Reynolds been able to successfully develop a reduced T/N ratio cigarette that it's introduced into commercial market?

A. No.

Q. What are the problems with a

reduced T/N ratio cigarette that Reynolds encountered?

A. One of the problems is the concept of having a balanced smoke, again, in terms of the taste and the perception of smoke, having something that would be, in relative terms, higher in nicotine and lower in tar changes the balance in terms of the way the smoke is perceived, the overall taste. It can be harsher and so it's not something that has been commercially introduced at this point in time.

Q. Does Reynolds continue to have an interest in trying to develop a reduced T/N ratio cigarette?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If you could get Exhibit Number 14, please.

Doctor, Exhibit 14 is a May 10, 1973 RDM by John Woods and Gloria Harllee. Do you see that?

Q.  If you turn to page 3, counsel asked you a question or two about the sentence under the Free or Unbound Nicotine paragraph, and I just want to orient us. The statement is set forth in the middle of the first paragraph under Free Or Unbound Nicotine. It says, "Since the unbound nicotine is very much more active physiologically, and much faster acting than the bound nicotine, the smoke at a high pH seems to be strong in nicotine," and there is a reference to 5.

Did I read that accurately?

A.  Yes.

Q.  If you'll turn to the back, what is reference number 5?

A. Reference number 5 is a presentation at the CORESTA and TCRC meeting in Williamsburg, Virginia. That meeting occurred on October 23, 1972.  The presentation was made by Dr. Claus Brunnemann, and his co-author is Dr. Dietrich Hoffmann.

Q.  Do you know at the time who Dr. Hoffmann and Dr. Brunnemann, what entity

they were affiliated with?

A.  Yes, they were affiliated with the American Health Foundation.

Q. The fact that that reference is put after the sentence I just read, does that indicate to you that these are the conclusions of Mr. Woods and Ms. Harllee or the conclusions of Drs. Brunnemann and Hoffman?

A. It suggests that they're the conclusion of Drs. Brunnemann and Hoffmann. MR. KREINER: Let's mark this as

the next exhibit.

(Borgerding Exhibit 17 was marked

for identification.) BY MR. KREINER:

Q.  (Handing.) Doctor, I've handed you what's been marked as deposition Exhibit 17, author, Leslie S. Lewis dated June 24, 1996, entitled, "Review of Internal Reports Regarding Cigarette Smoke pH and Sales Trends."

Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes.

Q.    Earlier you referred to a memo by

Ms. Lewis on this issue.  Is this the memo you were referring to?

A.  I believe that it is. Let me have a quick look.

Yes, it is.

Q.  Is this document, in fact, on your reliance list?

A.  It is, yes.

Q. You were shown in deposition Exhibit 14 we were just looking at, that's the Woods and Harllee memo from May 10, 1973 If you could turn to page 15 of Ms. Lewis' memo, deposition Exhibit 17.  I want to call your attention to reference 15. Are you there?

A.  I am, yes.

Q. Reference 15, is that what deposition Exhibit 14 is referring to?

A.  It is, yes.

Q. Let's turn to the first page of Ms. Lewis' memo, again, deposition Exhibit 17, the first page.

A. The cover page?

Q.    Yes.

under "Summary"? "The history of smoke pH methodology is briefly summarized in this review, particularly regarding the many changes in methodology during the 1960's and 1970*s. The various approaches to smoke pH measurements make comparisons over long periods of time difficult to interpret.  Xn addition, different researchers appear to have different ideas of what was the most meaningful of the different smoke pH values that could be measured."

Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes, you did.

Q. The next paragraph.  "This chronology is important because of an RJR research department finding," finding is in quotes, "in the early's 1970's that," quote, "high," close quote, "smoke pH was a characteristic common to several competitive cigarette brands that were showing increase in sales trends."

Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes.

Q.  That, quote, finding, is that consistent with what is reflected in

deposition Exhibit 14, the Woods and Harllee memo?

A.  It is, yes.

Q. Let's continue with Ms. Lewis' memo.  "However, using a database that spans over a decade and is based on a consistent smoke pH test method, it appears that sales trends of the 1970's were not determined by smoke pH, despite the correlations reported. From this review, the correlation of the early 1970's appear to have been merely coincidental in nature, calculated at a time when cigarette brands were growing their market share and their smoke pH happened to be relatively high.  There is no evidence from the historical data review that smoke pH of RJR brands was purposely increased to enhance sales."

Did I read that accurately?

A. Yes, you did.

Q.  Is that consistent with your opinions with respect to smoke pH and sales trends?

A.  It is, yes.

Q. Doctor, you were asked, or in

response to some questions about the Woods and Harllee memo, you pointed out that there were differences in smoke pH tests that were conducted, correct?

A. Yes.

Q. Explain to us the significance of the differences in those tests as it relates to what Ms. Lewis points out regarding interpreting those results.

A. There have been a number of different smoke pH tests that have been proposed by researchers over the years and have been applied to different cigarettes. And, in fact, I have conducted studies where, for example, when we first began to report certain values for state regulatory reporting requirements, to understand the effect of methodology on the value obtained. And for a given cigarette, that is just one type of cigarette, the pH value that's obtained can be drastically different depending upon the test that's applied. And this is driven by a number of factors, the amount or proportion of smoke that's collected, the technique that's applied and so on. But as X have

indicated in an earlier answer, smoke pH is not an absolute value, it's a concept, I believe that it's a concept that's been largely misunderstood rather than understood, but from a chemistry standpoint and from an understanding about products in general. But the values can vary quite a bit from one test to the next.

Q. As someone who has worked at Reynolds for over 30 years, do you have an opinion as to whether it's just simply a matter as increasing smoke pH as a way to increase the sales of your cigarettes?

A.  I don't believe that that is a viable approach to increasing the sales. MR. KREINER: Doctor, that's all

the questions I have for you right now. MR. VINIK: I have just a little

bit of follow up.

CONTINUED EXAMINATION BY MR. VINIK:

Q.  I just want to clarify a few things that you testified to on cross.

One of the things that you testified to on cross was the billion dollars

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

ro copgNbr=309

that was spent on tobacco heating technology and the work that was done on tobacco heating technology. Do you recall that?

A. Yes.

Q. I think I misunderstood your earlier testimony. I thought you had said earlier that about a billion dollars was spent on risk reduction techniques in general over the last  I think it was ten years.

Am I misstating what your prior testimony was?

A. We would have to read it back. But I believe that you are  my recollection is that you asked about ten years, and my response, if I recall correctly, was that I don't know the exact figure for the last ten-year period.

What I do know is that well over a billion dollars has been spent on risk reduction technologies, for example, well over a billion dollars has been spent just on the development tobacco heating technologies.

Q.  I see.

And do you have a figure in mind if you include all risk reduction research, all

311

risk reduction technology over the past ten years, would it be well over a billion dollars because you are including tobacco heating technologies as well as other things as well?

A.  In the last ten years, I don't have a figure in mind, but what I would say is that virtually everything that we do in the research and development department is focused on trying to understand and reduce the risks associated with the use of tobacco products. And all of the costs of our research and development, by and large, is in that vein. As far as the exact figure during the last ten years, it may not be a billion dollars, but it would be quite a substantial figure.

Q. Do you know what the budget is for the research and development department as a whole for, say, 2011?

A.  It varies by year, but it would probably be on the order of 60 to 80 million dollars.

Q.  So you are not including with the 60 to 80 million dollars the billion dollars

(212) 279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

(212) 490-3430

pgNbr=311
312

that was spent to develop the Eclipse or the Premier?

A.  No.

Q.  So it would be over and above?

A. Well, in terms of Eclipse and Premier, those are things that were developed beginning in the 1980's, so that's the cumulative expenditure in terms of developing  conducting that research, developing ways to manufacture such a product, being able to produce it. That's the entire concept of being able to produce a product to enter into commerce that has a potentially reduced risk by heating or primarily heating rather than burning tobacco.

Q. So it's fair to say that if you include Premier and Eclipse, and we're talking about maybe from the 1980's, we're talking about probably multiple billions of dollars spent on risk reduction technologies and research in that regard?

A. Well over a billion, yes.

Q. And probably over two billion?

A. Possibly so.

Q.  I just also want to clarify something else as well. You talked about, during cross-examination, selective reduction and general reduction. Do you remember that?

A. Yes.

Q. And you also talked about how the fact that calls to do the selective reduction and general reduction came from outside of RJR?

A.  Yes.

Q. Were there also calls to engage in selective reduction and general reduction that came from internally from RJR or was the only reason because they came from outside RJR, the calls?

A. As far as the calls, by "calls," I mean, there was that concept put forward, and that guidance even, from those individuals, the Surgeon General, from Dr. Gori and publications from others as well.

In terms of within Reynolds, X don't know that the term "call" is appropriate, but the research programs were aligned and the guiding principle for product development, during those many years was to

314

reduce  to develop technologies in cigarette designs that would reduce the yields of tar and nicotine from cigarettes and that would reduce the potential for exposure to compounds that were reported to be associated with the risks of smoking.

Q. So the reason that R. J. Reynolds was trying to reduce the risk of smoking was not only because of calls from outside R. J. Reynolds to do so, but also because Reynolds saw that it was in its best interests to reduce the risk of smoking?

A.  Reynolds felt that it was appropriate, yes.

Q. More than just appropriate, but also in Reynolds' best commercial interest?

A. I believe that it was in the best interests of all the stakeholders.

Q. By "the stakeholders," you mean the shareholders of Reynolds?

A. No, I mean cigarette smokers, the company, society in general.

Q.  X want you to take a look at Exhibit 17. That's the Leslie Lewis Review of Internal Reports Regarding Cigarette Smoke

pH and Sales Trends.

A.  Yes.

Q.  I'm not sure it was clear during your testimony. What was the date of that report?

A. The date of that report is June 24, 1996.

Q. Did you do any of the work on this report yourself personally?

A. No, I didn't do any of the work as far as drafting this report.

Q. And X am not just talking about drafting the report, I'm talking about the work that went into the report, not the physical writing of it. Were you involved in any parts of this?

A.  I wasn't.  If I was, it would have been indirect in terms of any responsibilities around conducting smoke pH measurements or someone within my research team doing that. But I don't believe that we were.

Q. So what you know about this report is really just what you have read here?

A. Yes.

Q. Now, the document was created in 1996, after litigation had already ensued against the tobacco companies regarding the tobacco companies' liability for sales of cigarettes, right?

A. There was litigation that preceded the time frame 1996.  I don't know specifically what you are referring to, Q. Well, the document on the top left-hand side on the program says, "Legal and Regulatory Responses," right? A. It does, yes.

Q. So this document was put together really as a legal response in response to litigation that was ongoing?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: I don't know that that's true.  I see in the document where it states very clearly what the objective of the document is, and it further describes the data that it relies upon and summaries the information that was found. BY MR. VINIK:

someone to go back and review the history of smoke pH going back to the 1960's?

A.  It continued to be an active area of discussion, there continued to be individuals within the scientific community, within the regulatory community that had declared certain views or certain beliefs, and in terms of this particular document, it made note of the fact that earlier in the early 1970's in one of the earlier exhibits, there had been certain conclusions arrived at in that particular document. It took the opportunity to look at a broader, more comprehensive data set and see if that was true or if it had remained true.

Q.  I understand what the document is doing. My question is really a simpler one. Was part of the purpose of this document to respond to any legal concerns?

MR. KREINER: Objection to form. THE WITNESS: Not that I am aware of. At the same time, I would expect that it was known that it was a relevant topic in terms of the scientific community and perhaps in litigation as

This Interrogatory contains questions which directly and indirectly relate to contested legal and scientific issues In this case  including for example, concepts associated with addiction, dependence or and efforts to cease or reduce the use of cigarettes. Nicotine has been recognized as an addictive substance1 by some of the defendants, most major medical organizations, including the Surgeon General, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, The American Psychological Association, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and the Medical Research Counsel of the United Kingdom. Tobacco Use Disorder Tobacco Dependence has been listed in the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases authored by the WHO3, and Tobacco Withdrawal Syndrome is described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, DSM III-R, APA 19873. The Surgeon General in 1088 defined addiction as the compulsive use of a drug that has psychoactivity and that may be associated with tolerance and physical dependence.4 A report issued in 1991 concluded 3

 Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addictive

 Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction

  The pharmacological and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Cohen (1991)5 and "ethers have reported on the questions of withdrawal and tolerance. Both animal and limited human data suggest that nicotine use is associated with increased tolerance. Animal studies show tolerance to several effects including locomotor activity, operant responding, electroencephalogram activity, and physiologic responses. Animals will self-administer nicotine after conditioning, a fact that suggests the obsolescence of the "addictive personality" notion. In humans, "it is clear that some tolerance does develop." There is an "orderly pattern of daily dose gradation" where smokers begin with only a few cigarettes and progress to many more, tolerating the unpleasant side effects first experienced, Withdrawal syndrome has been studied with questionnaire surveys reporting "cravings for tobacco,

irritability, restlessness, anxiety, difficulty In concentrating, increased appetite and food intake and weight gain." Observable symptoms of withdrawal include increased heart rate, performance deficits, changes In resting EEG, and other things. Surrogate administration of nicotine, as with nicotine gum, removes most but not all of the symptoms. Cohen concluded that nicotine addiction was a real and serious phenomenon: Tobacco use is a form of drug addiction, as shown by studies assessing the abuse liability of tobacco and nicotine in humans and animals. Tobacco experimentation frequently leads to dally use, which is characterized by a highly consistent pattern of drug intake. Such a pattern is controlled by the biologic concentrations of nicotine, a psychoactive constituent of tobacco smoke. Nicotine Is a euphoriant, self administered by humans as well as by animals in laboratory settings. Nicotine controls smokers' behavior in such a way that reducing or suppressing tobacco consumption produces a withdrawal syndrome.

According to the FDA6, it is nicotine, not "pleasure" that makes smokers return to their habit: A number of top tobacco industry officials have stated that they do not believe that tobacco is addictive. They may tell you that smokers smoke for "pleasure," not to satisfy a nicotine craving. Experts tell us that their patients report that only a small minority of the cigarettes they smoke in a day are highly pleasurable. Experts believe that the remainder are smoked to primarily sustain nicotine blood levels and to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The industry couches nicotine's effects in euphemisms such as "satisfaction" "impact": or "strength," ... But these terms only sidestep the fact that the companies are marketing a powerfully addictive agent Despite the buzzwords used by industry what smokers are addicted to is not "rich aroma" or "pleasure" or "satisfaction." What they are addicted to is nicotine, pure and simple, because of its psychoactive effects and its drug dependence qualities. When inhaled, nicotine reaches the brain in seven to nine seconds, initiating a sequence of events that Includes the production of dopamine. Dopamine, a substance connected with regulation of motivation and emotion, is commonly triggered by addictive substances. Information from the tobacco manufacturers was available on the addictive properties of cigarettes at an early date. A 1963 study of the tobacco manufacturers reported7 Chronic Intake of nicotine tends to restore the normal physiological functioning of the endocrine system, so that ever-Increasing dose levels of nicotine are necessary to maintain the desired action. Unlike other dopings, such as morphine, the demand for increasing dose levels is relatively slow for nicotine.

Addison Yeaman, General Counsel for Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company, stated in 1963, "We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug effective in the release of stress mechanisms." Later, William L. Dunn, an official at Philip Morris, stated,

"Think of the cigarette pack as a storage container for a day's supply of nicotine... think of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine."'

As stated by the FDA Commissioner9, most people who become addicted to tobacco simply lose the ability to choose to quit: It is fair to argue that the decision to start smoking may be a matter of choice. But once they have started smoking regularly, most smokers are in effect deprived of the choice to stop smoking,,.,Seventeen million Americans try to quit smoking each year. But more than 15,000,000 individuals are unable to exercise that choice because they cannot break their addiction to cigarettes. My concern is that the choice that they are making at a young age quickly becomes little or no choice at all and will be very difficult to undo for the rest of their lives. Numerous surveys have been conducted over the last 40 years on the public's perceptions of cigarette smoking.10 These surveys have established, among other things, that:

 Eight out of ten smokers say they wish they had not started;

 70% of young people ages 12:18 who smoke say they are dependent or addicted;

 40% of high school seniors who smoke regularly have tried to quit and failed;

 Over 50% of teenagers do not believe they will become addicted.

 A large percentage of the smoking population is still unappreciativc of the excessive health risks associated with smoking." The public's perceptions have been influenced over the years by the advertising and other statements of the defendant tobacco companies and tobacco sellers. Defendant tobacco sellers haye advertised tobacco products in their stores in forms ranging from posters and flyers to promotional campaigns and contests.

Thus whether the decedent quit or continued smoking was impacted by his addiction to nicotine in defendant's cigarettes.

Decedent smoked cigarettes all the time when he woke up until the time he went to bed. He smoked up until his death, Decedent smoked cigarettes from approximately the age of 16 years old.

INTERROGATORY NO, 27: List each and every item of expense and/or damage you seek to recover on behalf of the estate and survivors of Decedent in this lawsuit, including but not limited to those damages allowed to be recovered in a wrongful death action under  768.21, Florida Statutes, stating the amount you are claiming for each expense and/or damage; the facts that support each expense and/or damage; and the method you used in computing the amount of each expense and/or damage.

RESPONSE;

Plaintiff seeks recovery of medical expenses, pain and suffering, and lost wages. Plaintiff has not yet determined the amount to be sought. Plaintiffs will request full compensatory and punitive damages,

INTERROGATORY NO, 28: Did the Decedent ever purchase or otherwise obtain cigarettes directly from any Tobacco Manufacturer Defendant instead of through a retailer or other third party? If so, state the brand obtained, the Tobacco Manufacturer Defendant that provided the cigarettes, and the date(s) and the manner in which the Decedent obtained such cigarettes.

RESPONSE;

Plaintiff is unaware whether decedent purchased cigarettes directly from the tobacco

companies.

Plaintiff also objects to segregating treaters facilities and illnesses between those that are smoking related or not, as defendants will order records for any and all medical records, billing, laboratory, pathology, MRI, CT Scans etc., as a result of all medical releases provided to defendants to obtain this information. Decedent suffered from conditions, illnesses and/or diseases associated with treatment for lung cancer caused by the use of defendants tobacco products. He also suffered from addiction and/or habituation to defendants tobacco products which is characterized by extreme difficulty or inability in terminating use. Plaintiff suffered from coughing, excessive phlegm, shortness of breath and respiratory discomfort. Use of defendants cigarettes created genetic damage, changes in plaintiffs airways and other diseases, condition and illnesses that began after plaintiff initiated use of defendants tobacco products and was the ultimate cause of his death. The disease processes associated with the use of tobacco products killed the decedent on April 29,1996.

The decedent died of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Lung. To the best of the Plaintiffs present recollection he was treated by:

RESEQES&

Plaintiffs object to these questions to the extent the question and any single answer is meant to convey a complete picture of the smokers dependence oh cigarettes or answer to whether the smoker was addicted. Plaintiffs further object to these questions to the extent the questions are Incomplete in that the question is framed to the exclusion of other elements of dependence and addiction otherwise combine discrete concepts related to addiction and legal causation and quitting and comparative fault.

This Interrogatory contains questions which directly and indirectly relate to contested legal and scientific issues in this case - including for example, concepts associated with addiction, dependence or and efforts to cease or reduce the use of cigarettes. Nicotine has been

13pgNbr=487
recognized as an addictive substance1 by some of the defendants, most major medical organizations, Including the Surgeon General, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, The American Psychological Association, the American Society of Addiction Medicine, and the Medical Research Counsel of the United Kingdom. Tobacco Use Disorder Tobacco Dependence has been listed in the ninth revision of the International Classification of Diseases authored by the WHO3, and Tobacco Withdrawal Syndrome is described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, DSM III-R, APA19873. The Surgeon General In 1988 defined addiction as the compulsive use of a drug that has psychoactJvity and that may be associated with tolerance and physical dependence,4 A report issued in 1991 concluded;

 Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addictive

 Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes addiction

  The pharmacological and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Cohen (1991)* and "ethers have reported on the questions of withdrawal and tolerance. Both animal and limited human data suggest that nicotine use is associated with increased tolerance. Animal studies show tolerance to several effects including locomotor activity, operant responding* electroencephalogram activity, and physiologic responses. Animals will self-administer nicotine after conditioning, a fact that suggests the obsolescence of the "addictive personality" notion. In humans, "it is clear that some tolerance does develop." There is an "orderly pattern of daily dose gradation" where smokers begin with only a few cigarettes and progress to many more, tolerating the unpleasant side effects first experienced. Withdrawal syndrome has been studied with questionnaire surveys reporting "cravings for tobacco, irritability, restlessness, anxiety, difficulty in concentrating, increased appetite and food intake and weight gain." Observable symptoms of withdrawal include increased heart rate, performance deficits, changes in resting EEG, and other things. Surrogate administration of

nicotine, as with nicotine gum, removes most but not all of the symptoms. Cohen concluded that nicotine addiction was a real and serious phenomenon: Tobacco use is a form of drug addiction, as shown by studies assessing the abuse liability of tobacco and nicotine in humans and animals. Tobacco experimentation frequently leads to daily use, which Is characterized by a highly consistent pattern of drug intake. Such a. pattern is controlled by the biologic concentrations of nicotine, a psychoactive constituent of tobacco smoke. Nicotine is a euphoriant, self administered by humans as well as by animals in laboratory settings. Nicotine controls smokers' behavior in such a way that reducing or suppressing tobacco consumption produces a withdrawal syndrome.

According to the FDA6, it is nicotine, not "pleasure" that makes smokers return to their habit: A number of top tobacco industry officials have stated that they do not believe that tobacco is addictive. They may tell you that smokers smoke for "pleasure," not to satisfy a nicotine craving. Experts tell us that their patients report that only a small minority of the cigarettes they smoke in a day are highly pleasurable. Experts believe that the remainder are smoked to primarily sustain nicotine blood levels and to avoid withdrawal symptoms. The industry couches nicotine's effects in euphemisms such as "satisfaction" "impact": or "strength."... But these terms only sidestep the fact that the companies are marketing a powerfully addictive agent Despite the buzzwords used by industry what smokers are addicted to is not "rich aroma" or "pleasure" or "satisfaction." What they are addicted to is nicotine, pure and simple, because of its psychoactive effects and its drug dependence qualities. When inhaled, nicotine reaches the brain in seven to nine seconds, initiating a sequence of events that includes the production of dopamine. Dopamine, a substance connected with regulation of motivation and emotion, is commonly triggered by addictive substances. Information from the tobacco manufacturers was available on the addictive properties of cigarettes at an early date, A 1963 study of the tobacco manufacturers reported7 Chronic intake of nicotine tends to restore the normal physiological functioning of the endocrine system, so that ever-increasing dose levels of nicotine are necessary to maintain the desired action. Unlike other dopings, such as morphine, the demand for increasing dose levels is relatively slow for nicotine,

Addison Yeaman, General Counsel for Brown and Williamson Tobacco Company, stated in 1963, "We are, then, In the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug effective in the release of stress mechanisms." Later, William L. Dunn, an official at Philip Morris, stated, "Think of the cigarette pack as a storage container for a day's supply of nicotine... think of the cigarette as a dispenser for a dose unit of nicotine."*

As stated by the FDA Commissioner9, most people who become addicted to tobacco simply lose the ability to choose to quit: It is fair to argue that the decision to start smoking may be a matter of choice. But once they have started smoking regularly, most smokers are in effect deprived of the choice to stop smoking.... Seventeen million Americans try to quit smoking each year. But more than 15,000,000 individuals are unable to exercise that choice because they cannot break their addiction to cigarettes. My concern is that the choice that they are making at a young age quickly becomes little or no choice at all and will be very difficult to undo for the rest of their lives. Numerous surveys have been conducted over the last 40 years on the public's perceptions of cigarette smoking.10 These surveys have established, among other things, that:

 Eight out of ten smokers say they wish they had not started;

 70% of young people ages 12:18 who smoke say they are dependent or addicted;

 40% of high school seniors who smoke regularly have tried to quit and failed;

 Over 50% of teenagers do not believe they will become addicted.

 A large percentage of the smoking population is still unappredative of the excessive health risks associated with smoking.w The public's perceptions have been Influenced over the years by the advertising and other statements of the defendant tobacco companies and

Dr. Figlar will testify that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with quality scientific staff, engineers, and technical personnel, Qver many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the investigation of cigarettes, cigarette smoke, the identification and quantification of smoke constituents, the reduction of smoke constituents, and the commercialization of cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr, Figlar will discuss Reynolds' historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

It is Dr, Figlar's opinion that Reynolds has been earnest in responding to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products. He will testify that Reynolds has. consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking and has diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields while substantially adding to it via its own scientific research. He will testify regarding Reynolds' R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. Dr. Figlar will discuss Reynolds' efforts to identify, develop and implement cigarette designs which substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine-smoking methods. Dr, Figlar will also discuss the many successful cigarette designs and technologies developed by Reynolds' scientists that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.

Dr. Figlar will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of more than 5,000 individual chemical constituents, the vast majority of which are formed naturally as a result of combustion and pyrolysis of the tobacco rod during smoking. He will

.4.pgNbr=496
testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds that have been identified by various governmental and public health entities as carcinogenic. Dr. Figlar will address Reynolds' efforts throughout the decades to implement designs that significantly reduced the yields of carcinogens and toxicants in the smoke of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients and additives used in cigarettes on its website, and to the federal government, as well as the stewardship of those additives and ingredients. He will discuss the statements on smoking and health issues communicated on Reynolds' website.

It is Dr. Figlar's opinion that it has been Reynolds' long-time goal to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents that have been associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify that based on the considerable technical obstacles of this goal, scientists and product developers must simultaneously ensure that technologies are feasible from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint and consumer acceptable when implemented in finished products. He will testify that in his experience, more often than not, problems occur in one or more of these areas and trade-offs between technical success and consumer acceptance must be weighed carefully. He will testify that over the years, numerous market introductions by Reynolds that achieved varying levels of technical success in smoke constituent reduction failed to achieve wide-reaching consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such commercial products, including, but not limited to, carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicottnized" or ultra-low nicotine cigarette brands, as well as novel products such as Premier and Eclipse.

Dr. Figlar will testify regarding Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in its cigarettes, as well as its responses to public health concerns, He will

W 0)

ro

CO

opgNbr=497
testify that Reynolds' efforts to reduce "tar" yields were a guiding principle in the development and execution of product and technologies over the course of many decades.

He may also testify regarding the FTC method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machinermeasured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. Dr. Figlar will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, predict smoke intake for any individual smoker. He will discuss the wide recognition in the scientific and public health communities that there is a broad range of smoking behaviors that influence smoke yield and intake. He will note that despite these variations, on average, smokers of low yield cigarettes receive less smoke than those of higher yielding cigarettes. Dr. Figlar will testify, that Reynolds does not design its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC method.

Dr. Figlar will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: 1) general reduction and 2) selective reduction. He will discuss the design techniques and technological advances used in general reduction by Reynolds and its domestic competitors that reduce the FTC "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarette smoke to reduce potential exposure to myriad chemical constituents. Hence, general reduction attempts to address risk as a whole, in reference to cigarette smoke, rather than targeting any single smoke component, In discussing general reduction, Dr. Figlar will testify that the cigarette design techniques utilized to reduce FTC smoke yield include: filtration, filter ventilation, high/increased porosity cigarette paper(s), cigarette paper burn promoters, expanded tobaccos, reconstituted tobaccos, reduced tobacco weight, cigarette rod

6 pgNbr=498
length reduction, reduced cigarette density, and reduced rod circumference.           Dr. Figlar will

testify about the implementation of various general reduction techniques to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in Reynolds' cigarettes, including brand line extensions. He will testify that, at all times, the cigarettes manufactured by Reynolds conformed with the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacturing and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at a standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yield.

He may testify regarding the development of specific technological, advances used in general reduction, such as expanded tobacco, which was invented by Reynolds and first implemented in the marketplace in the 1960's as a design tool that enabled the development of cigarettes with lower tobacco weight because expanded tobacco reduces rod density. Dr. Figlar will discuss the reductions in FTC "tar" and nicotine yields that accompany expanded tobacco since the amount of tobacco burned is reduced.

Dr. Figlar will discuss the ways in which Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies and how these techniques are used in the marketplace today. In support of such testimony, he will cite to examples such as reconstituted tobacco, which was first used commercially by Reynolds and is now utilized by most tobacco, companies globally. He will discuss how reconstituted tobacco inclusion reduces both FTC "tar" and nicotine yields, and the limits to the amount that can be utilized in cigarette manufacture due to consumer acceptability. In addition to discussing general reduction broadly, he will testify to the incorporation of these techniques over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case,

Dr. Figlar will discuss the modifications that Reynolds made to its products in response to greater consumer demand for lower "tar"' products, coupled with government and public

-7-pgNbr=499
health authorities advocating this approach as a means to reduce the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify how the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds and the domestic cigarette manufacturers have substantially lowered the FTC <4tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will testify that the sales-weighted FTC "tar" and nicotine yields per cigarette have fallen nearly 60% percent since the 1950's, from approximately 38 mg "tar" and 2.8 mg nicotine per cigarette to approximately 12 milligrams "tar" and 0.9 mg nicotine today. He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing and launching low "tar" and/or ultra low "tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr, Figlar will also testify that general reduction decreases the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns. With respect to low tar products, he will also be prepared to address such topics as smoker compensation and Reynolds' research in this area,

Dr. Figlar will testify regarding Reynolds' efforts to address the public health concerns of smoking by means of selective reduction. He will explain Reynolds' work in identifying and quantifying the target compounds of interest and consequently developing technologies to expedite specific chemistry reduction and create products that were commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will also discuss the ways in which Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years, including its historic and current efforts, technologies and products, such as carbon filtered cigarettes. Dr. Figlar will testify about Reynolds' commitment to developing technologies and products with the

-8-pgNbr=500

potential to address the risks associated with smoking with the development of "heat-not-burn" products, such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also discuss innovation in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique.

Dr. Figlar will testify that Reynolds cigarettes have been developed and manufactured with recognized state-of-the-art methodologies and practices at all times during the last six decades. He may testify about Reynolds' research efforts on alternative or novel cigarette designs, including attempts to modify 'tar'Ynicotine ratios in response to requests of members of the public health community, including the U.S. Surgeon General. As part of those efforts, he will discuss Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and others, He will also address Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments for the development of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no governmental authority, public health group, academic institution, scientific establishment or private entrepreneur has ever developed any superior alternative cigarette design, even though the subject has been extensively researched for decades.

Dr. Figlar will testify about Reynolds' efforts to develop novel products such as Premier and Eclipse, as well as its efforts to develop reduced risk products. He will discuss alternative cigarette designs and the lack of consensus among government, scientific, medical and public health communities as to which test, battery of tests or other evaluation approaches should be used to determine if one cigarette design may present less risk than another. He will testify and describe Reynolds' product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Figlar may also discuss studies in smokers by Reynolds, including yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

-9-pgNbr=501
Dr, Figlar may testify regarding allegations of nicotine manipulation. He will be prepared to address the topics of smoke pH, "free" nicotine, and the use of ammonia. He will testify that Reynolds has not manipulated nicotine, altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine, or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will opine that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase mainstream smoke pH or "free nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using the FTC method.

Dr. Figlar may testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding Reynolds' cigarette research and design efforts. He may also offer testimony in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Figlar reserves the right to amend this disclosure.

Subject Matter of ^perf T^tlmOflY

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with high quality scientific staff, engineers and technical personnel Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the research and development of cigarettes. Reynolds' scientists have been recognized for their expertise in identifying smoke constituents, quantifying yields of cigarette smoke constituents, reducing smoke constituent yields, and commercializing cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products,

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has earnestly responded to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products based upon the extensive research conducted in Reynolds' laboratories. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking, diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields, and substantially added to the scientific literature via its own scientific research. He will testify about Reynolds' R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. He will testify about Reynolds' efforts to identify, develop, and implement cigarette designs that substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine-smoking methods, mouth-level

-16-pgNbr=508
exposure measures, and studies of biomarkers. Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has developed successful cigarette designs and technologies that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of thousands of individual chemical constituents. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds identified by various governmental and public health entities as known, probable, or possible carcinogens by the U.S. EPA, IARC, or the U.S. National Toxicology Program.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that, despite considerable technical obstacles, Reynolds has worked to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify about criteria for new tobacco product development, including ensuring that products do not introduce unintended consequences, finished products are consumer acceptable, technologies are feasible from a regulatory standpoint, and technologies are feasible from a manufacturing standpoint, He will testify thai over the years many market introductions by Reynolds and other cigarette manufacturers have achieved technical success in reducing smoke constituents but have failed to achieve widespread consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such products, including carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotinized" cigarettes, ultra-low yielding cigarettes, and tobacco-heating cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about cigarette test methods, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and Mtar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for

-17,pgNbr=509
MM

relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. It is Dr. Borgerding's opinion that Reynolds has not designed its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC or any other cigarette test method. Dr. Borgerding will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and that the scientific and public health communities widely recognize that a broad range of smoking behaviors influence smoke yield and intake. He will testify that despite these variations, smokers of lower machine yield cigarettes, on average, receive less smoke than smokers of higher machine yield cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds' efforts to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields were a key guiding principle in the development and execution of its product designs and product technologies over the course of many decades.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: (1) general reduction and (2) selective reduction. In discussing general reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about the cigarette design techniques Reynolds has used to achieve smoke yield reductions, including; filtration; filter ventilation; high/increased porosity cigarette paper(s); cigarette paper burn promoters; expanded tobaccos; reconstituted tobaccos; reduced tobacco weight; cigarette rod length reduction; reduced cigarette density; and reduced rod circumference. He will testify that, at all times, Reynolds' cigarettes conformed to the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacture and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at given standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields. Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies that are in use in the marketplace today.   He will testify about the incorporation of general reduction

technologies over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has modified its products in response to consumer demand for lower "tar1" products and government and public health authority recommendations for reducing "tar" and nicotine yields as a means of reducing the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify that the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds have substantially lowered machine-measured *Har" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing low "tar" and/or ultra low "tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Borgerding will also testify that general reduction techniques effectively reduce the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related to smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns and reduce the risks of cigarette smoking.

In discussing selective reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' work in identifying and quantifying the toxicants of Interest, developing technologies to accomplish specific toxicant reductions, and developing products that are commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will testify that Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' development of innovative cigarette designs, including tobacco heating products such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also testify about innovations in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique.

-19-pgNbr=511
Dr. Borgerding may testify about Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments on the development and evaluation of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no U.S. governmental authority has ever recommended, mandated, acknowledged, or identified any alternative cigarette design to reduce the risks associated with cigarette smoking. In an effort to potentially reduce the risks of smoking, the European Union requires all cigarette designs to yield no more than 10 mg "tar," 1 mg nicotine, and 10 mg CO, according to standard test procedures. Reynolds was a leader in technologies to develop cigarettes to achieve these mandated levels.

His testimony will describe Reynolds' product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Borgerding will also testify about studies in smokers sponsored by Reynolds, including yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that Increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients used in its cigarettes (website, governmental reporting, and publications) and stewardship of ingredients.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about allegations of nicotine manipulation through altered cigarette design. He will testify that Reynolds has not altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will testify that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase "free nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using machine methods.

-20-pgNbr=512
Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' corporate positions on smoking and health issues and statements about smoking and health issues on its website.

Dr. Borgerding will testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding Reynolds' cigarette research and design efforts.

Summary of Opinions and Testimony

Dr, Cook's expert testimony will include the subjects of American and B&W's historical research and testing related to cigarettes and smoking and health, including internal research, funding of external research, and contributions to the published literature; American and B&W's efforts to develop cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks of smoking, including its efforts to respond to recommendations to reduce "tar" and nicotine; general and selective reduction of components of cigarette smoke; cigarette smoke chemistry; smoke pH; ammonia; nicotine and allegations of nicotine manipulation; alternative and novel cigarette designs by American and B&W; the design of American and B&W cigarettes; the battery of tests used for American and B&W cigarettes; American and B&W's efforts to work with the public health community to reduce the inherent health risks of smoking, including work with the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group; use of ingredients and additives by American and B&W; the federal disclosure of the ingredients and additives used by American and B&W; American and B&W positions on smoking and health issues; company website content and information; American R&D's library and document retention policies; B&W's R&D library and document retention policies; and any cigarette brands claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Cook will testify that for many decades, American and B&W were actively engaged in researching and testing cigarettes and cigarette smoke, identifying and quantifying smoke constituents, attempting to reduce or eliminate certain smoke constituents, conducting and/or

-23-pgNbr=515
sponsoring biological testing of cigarettes and cigarette smoke, and developing and commercializing cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking. He will discuss American and B&W's responsiveness to smoking and health issues. He will testify that American and B&W monitored the scientific literature and diligently tested theories and claims for addressing the risks of smoking. Dr. Cook will discuss the approaches that American and B&W took to commercially implement cigarette designs that provided significant reductions in machine yields of many smoke constituents. He will discuss the work of American and B&W scientists who were pioneers in the field of cigarette design and each company's implementation of state of the art cigarette design technologies in their commercial cigarettes.

Dr. Cook will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol composed of more than 5,000 individual chemical constituents. Cigarette smoke constituents are formed by the combustion and pyrolysis of the tobacco rod during smoking. Cigarette smoke contains many chemicals that have been classified by various governmental and public health authorities, including the International Agency for Research on Cancer, as carcinogens. Both American and B&W implemented cigarette design technologies that significantly reduced the standardized machine generated yields of these carcinogens in the smoke of their cigarettes.

Dr. Cook will opine that American and B&W's research efforts were focused on attempting to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents that were thought to be related to the risks of smoking. He will discuss how, in addition to the technical goal of reducing or eliminating cigarette smoke constituents including carcinogens in smoke, American and B&W cigarette designers had to simultaneously address manufacturing feasibility, regulatory feasibility, and consumer acceptability of the finished cigarette, He will address the problems encountered in various stages of product development and the trade-offs that American and B&W had to

-24-pgNbr=516
address among technical success, manufacturing feasibility, and consumer acceptance. He will testify that consumer acceptance is a significant factor in designing cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking because regardless of the technical success of a new cigarette design, if consumers dp not like the cigarette, it will not sell. Dr. Cook will address American and B&W's work over the decades to achieve both risk reduction and consumer acceptability, He will discuss various American and B&W products that were introduced in the marketplace that achieved technical success in reducing standardized machine generated smoke constituent yields but failed to achieve wide consumer acceptance. He may point to such examples as carbon-filtered cigarettes, tobacco heating cigarettes, and cigarettes with extremely low standardized machine generated yields of nicotine.

Dr. Cook will testify that American and B&W's historical cigarette design efforts to try to reduce the yields of constituents in smoke can be broken down into two broad categories: 1) general reduction; and 2) selective reduction. He will testify that general reduction technologies are designed to reduce "tar", nicotine, and all chemical constituents of smoke, including carcinogens. He will discuss that general reduction was an approach that was used extensively by American and B&W to dramatically reduce the standardized machine generated .smoke yields of commercial cigarettes. He may testify regarding the following general reduction cigarette design techniques: filtration, reconstituted tobacco, expanded tobacco, reduced circumference, processed tobacco stems, filter ventilation, porous cigarette paper, and faster burning cigarette paper.

He may also testify regarding implementation of various general reduction techniques to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in American and B&W cigarettes, including brand line extensions of many American and B&W brands.  Dr. Cook will opine that at all times the

pgNbr=517
cigarettes manufactured by American and B&W conformed with the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacture and used the best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at a given standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yield.

Dr, Cook will discuss the basis for developing lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes which included; (1) repeated calls for cigarette manufacturers to develop lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes by the scientific community, as well as government and public health authorities; (2) encouragement for smokers to switch to lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes by government and public health authorities; (3) reported historical epidemiological studies finding that smokers of filtered cigarettes and/or lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes had a lower risk of lung cancer than smokers of unfiltered and/or higher "tar" cigarettes; (4) (he basic toxicological principles that the risk of any exposure to a chemical is related to dose and that efforts to reduce exposure to the constituents in smoke should result in lower risk of disease; (5) many studies in smokers reporting that, on average, smokers of lower standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine cigarettes get less smoke than smokers of higher standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine cigarettes; and (6) findings that general reduction techniques as implemented in commercial cigarettes resulted in a reduction of smoke constituents, including carcinogens, as measured by the standardized machine generated puffing conditions.

Dr. Cook will testify that as a result of the general reduction design changes, sales-weighted market average standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields have been reduced by nearly 60% from the early 1950s to today. He will testify that standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields in the early 1950s averaged about 38 mg and 2,8 mg per cigarette, respectively, while today the sales-weighted market average standardized machine generated yields are about 12 mg "tar" and 0.9 mg nicotine per cigarette. He will discuss how

-26-pgNbr=518
American and B&W provided consumers with products that span a wide range of standardized machine generated yields (including cigarettes with smoke yields so low they are difficult to measure) and how the lowest-yielding cigarettes are not consumer acceptable. With respect to these low yield products, he will be prepared to discuss smoker compensation, He will also testify that despite the consumer acceptance issue, American and B&W continued to research techniques for the general reduction of "tar" and nicotine.

Dr. Cook will testify that at the same time as they were exploring general reduction techniques, American and B&W were also researching approaches to selectively reduce certain constituents in cigarette smoke. He will discuss that selective reduction involves attempting to reduce the yields of specific chemicals in cigarette smoke. Dr. Cook will testify that to target the specific smoke constituents for reduction, American and B&W scientists studied the scientific literature, Surgeon General's Reports, the International Agency of Research on Cancer lists of carcinogens, and recommendations by individual scientists such as Dietrich Hoffmann, among others. He may testify about research at both American and B&W regarding selective reduction techniques, including efforts to reduce the yields of various classes of chemical compounds in smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, and nitrosamines.

Dr. Cook will testify that American and B&W designed cigarettes to meet consumer demand and to attempt to reduce the inherent health risks of smoking. He will discuss how, throughout the years, American and B&W explored a variety of novel and advanced cigarette and process development ideas that responded to recommendations in the scientific community. He may testify about American and B&W's research efforts on alternative or novel cigarette designs, including attempts to modify "tar'Vnicotine ratios in response to requests by members of

-27-pgNbr=519
the public health community, including the U.S, Surgeon General, As part of those efforts, Dr. Cook may discuss the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group.

Dr. Cook will testify about American and B&W's efforts to develop reduced risk products and their efforts to achieve a consensus with government and public health communities regarding those products. He will discuss that a significant obstacle in the development of cigarettes with the potential to reduce risk is the absence of accepted standards for assessing potential risk reduction. He will testify that even today there is no consensus among the government, scientific, medical, and public health communities about which test, or battery of tests, should be performed to determine whether one cigarette presents less risk, or is "safer," than another. He will discuss how in the absence of such a consensus, American and B&W conducted research on methods to assess its cigarettes and evaluated its products using those methods.

Dr. Cook will be prepared to address allegations regarding nicotine and nicotine manipulation. He may discuss such topics as smoke chemistry, smoke pH, the use and effect of ammonia in general and in American and B&W cigarettes, and the concept of free nicotine.

As a scientist at both American and B&W, Dr. Cook is prepared to testify regarding the R&D departments at American and B&W, including their libraries and document retention policies. He may testify regarding B&W's website. He may also offer testimony on the corporate positions of American and B&W regarding smoking and health issues, Dr. Cook may testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding American and B&W's cigarette research and design efforts.

Dr. Cook may also offer testimony on post-merger and current research activities of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. He may testify on related corporate entities including Targacept

-28-pgNbr=520
and Niconovum. Dr, Cook may also testify about certain factual financial information contained on the corporate website related to MSA payments, excise and sales taxes, manufacturer's cost, and profit per cigarette pack. He may offer testimony regarding regulatory issues and the Food and Drug Administration. He may also offer testimony in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits, and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Cook reserves the right to amend this disclosure.

Subject Matter of Expert Testimony

Dr. Garner will testify that Brown & Williamson and The American Tobacco Company followed and contributed to the body of publicly available literature on smoking and health as it developed, worked to understand the relationship between smoke constituents and the health impact of smoking, evaluated and developed chemical and biological tools to measure the

-33-pgNbr=525
contents of smoke and the health effects of smoking, and changes to cigarette design that could reduce the health impact of smoking, Dr. Gamer will testify that through research spanning many decades, American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson actively engaged in fundamental research to identify and quantify the constituents in cigarette smoke, He will testify that American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson followed the publicly available scientific literature on smoking and health. He will also discuss how American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson attempted to reduce or eliminate certain constituents in smoke. In addition, Dr. Garner will testify about the over 70% reduction in the tar and nicotine deliveries of commercially available cigarettes from the late 1950s to the present and that Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco provided their customers with a variety of products across a wide range of standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields,

Dr. Gamer will discuss the composition of cigarette smoke. More specifically, he will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol comprised of over 5,000 different chemical constituents. He will describe that most of these chemicals are formed during the pyrolysis of tobacco. He will also testify that approximately 60 of these compounds have been identified as being carcinogenic by one or more different government or public health groups. Dr. Gamer will further testify that American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson accomplished significant reductions in the yields of these carcinogens and toxicants in the smoke of their cigarettes through the implementation of various technologies. More specifically, Dr, Gamer will testify that for decades, American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson engaged in significant research to test and evaluate cigarette smoke, identify and quantify smoke constituents, work to reduce or eliminate certain smoke constituents, conduct or fund internal and external biological and

-34-pgNbr=526
chemical testing of cigarettes and their smoke, and work toward developing commercially viable reduced risk cigarettes.

Dr. Gamer will testify that the research efforts of American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson were directed toward attempting to reduce or eliminate certain smoke constituents thought to be related to the risks of smoking. He will generally discuss the different types of products developed, tested or introduced into the marketplace by American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson that achieved technical success in reducing standardized machine generated smoke constituent yields but were not consumer acceptable, including carbon-filtered cigarettes, low nicotine yield cigarettes, and tobacco heating cigarettes.

Dr. Garner will describe Reynolds' product stewardship program and its history and the current processes in place to ensure that new tobacco products or changes to existing tobacco products do not increase the inherent risks associated with tobacco use. He will also describe similar efforts employed by American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson to accomplish the same result. He will also talk about the work done by Reynolds to develop new animal models and other predictive tests to assess the comparative toxicity of tobacco products for use in product stewardship,

Dl Garner will explain the reasons behind the development of lower "tar and nicotine cigarettes. First, he will explain that guidance from the scientific and public health community and government authorities suggested that cigarette manufacturers develop lower "tar" and nicotine yield cigarettes. Second, Dr. Gamer will explain that the efforts of American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson to achieve lower machine yield "tar" and nicotine levels in their cigarettes by utilizing different technologies accomplished significant reductions in these measures. Dr, Gamer will then explain that the body of epidemiological evidence suggested that

- 35 -pgNbr=527
smokers of lower "tar" and nicotine yield cigarettes had a lower incidence of lung cancer than smokers of higher yielding products. He will explain that the general reduction techniques used by American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson in their cigarettes to reduce smoke constituents, including carcinogens, resulted in lower machine yields in commercial cigarettes and that smokers of these cigarettes have lower exposures to smoke constituents than do smokers of higher yielding products.

Dr. Garner will describe the difference between general reduction and selective reduction of smoke constituents. He will testify that selective reduction is the effort to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents and about the efforts of Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco to selectively reduce certain of these constituents, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, aldehydes, and nitrosamines, Dr. Garner will testify that American Tobacco's and Brown & Williamson's efforts to reduce certain classes of smoke constituents were largely guided by suggestions from leading scientists and public health authorities, including the Surgeon General and the International Agency of Research on Cancer,

Dr. Garner will discuss generally the standardized Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") method to measure the "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes and its historical function as a relative ranking of commercial cigarettes. Dr, Garner will testify that the FTC Method does not, and was never intended to, predict any individual's smoking behavior. He may also discuss the issue of smoker "compensation" generally.

Dr. Garner is prepared to discuss allegations regarding nicotine manipulation and the subjects of smoke pH and the use of ammonia in cigarettes.

Dr. Gamer will testify that there has never been a consensus as to what constitutes a safer cigarette. He will discuss how, despite this lack of consensus, American Tobacco and Brown &

-36-pgNbr=528
Williamson worked to develop cigarettes or novel products with reduced risk potential. Dr. Garner will also testify about Reynolds' work on products such as Premier and Eclipse, as well as Reynolds' own efforts to develop reduced risk products.

In addition to being prepared to testify about Reynolds' produot stewardship program, Dr. Garner may offer testimony concerning Reynolds' current positions on smoking and health, statements on Reynolds' website, and Reynolds' efforts to develop smokeless tobacco products and to migrate smokers to those products, He may also testify about corporate entities such as Targacept and Niconovum, and certain publicly available financial information such as MSA payments, excise and sales taxes, manufacturer's cost, and profit per cigarette pack. He may offer testimony regarding regulatory issues and the Food and Drug Administration.

Dr. Garner may also testify in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent that it relates to his areas of expertise, Dr. Garner reserves the right to amend this disclosure.

Dr, Gentry will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of more than 5,000 individual chemical constituents, the vast majority of which are formed naturally as a result of combustion and pyrolysis of the tobacco rod during smoking. He will

-40-pgNbr=532
testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds that have been identified by various governmental and public health entities as carcinogenic. Dr. Gentry will address Reynolds' efforts throughout the decades to implement designs that significantly reduced the yields of carcinogens and toxicants in the smoke of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients and additives used in cigarettes on its website, and to the federal government, as well as the stewardship of those additives and ingredients. He will discuss the statements on smoking and health issues communicated oh Reynolds' website.

It is Dr, Gentry's opinion that it has been Reynolds' long-time goal to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents that have been associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify that based on the considerable technical obstacles of this goal, scientists and product developers must simultaneously ensure that technologies are feasible from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint and consumer acceptable when implemented in finished products. He will testify that in his experience, more often than not, problems occur in one or more of these areas and trade-offs between technical success and consumer acceptance must be weighed carefully. He will testify that over the years, numerous market introductions by Reynolds that achieved varying levels of technical success in smoke constituent reduction failed to achieve wide-reaching consumer acceptance, He will point to examples of such commercial products, including, but not limited to, carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotinized" or ultra-low nicotine cigarette brands, as well as novel products such as Premier and Eclipse.

Dr. Gentry will testify regarding Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in its cigarettes, as well as its responses to public health concerns. He will

41-

w

0) COpgNbr=533
testify that Reynolds* efforts to reduce "tar" yields were a guiding principle in the development and execution of product and technologies over the course of many decades.

He may also testify regarding the FTC method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. Dr. Gentry will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, predict smoke intake for any individual smoker. He will discuss the wide recognition in the scientific and public health communities that there is a broad range of smoking behaviors that influence smoke yield and intake. He will note that despite these variations, on average, smokers of low yield cigarettes receive less smoke than those of higher yielding cigarettes. Dr. Gentry will testify that Reynolds does not design its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC method.

Dr. Gentry will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: 1) general reduction and 2) selective reduction. He will discuss the design techniques and technological advances used in general reduction by Reynolds and its domestic competitors that reduce the FTC '*tarw and nicotine yields of cigarette smoke to reduce potential exposure to myriad chemical constituents. Hence, general reduction attempts to address risk as a whole, in reference to cigarette smoke, rather than targeting any single smoke component. In discussing general reduction, Dr. Gentry will testify that the cigarette design techniques utilized to reduce FTC smoke yield include: filtration, filter ventilation, high/increased porosity cigarette papers), cigarette paper burn promoters, expanded tobaccos, reconstituted tobaccos, reduced tobacco weight, cigarette rod

42-pgNbr=534
length reduction, reduced cigarette density, and reduced rod circumference. Dr, Gentry will testify about the implementation of various general reduction techniques to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in Reynolds' cigarettes, including brand line extensions. He will testify that, at all times, the cigarettes manufactured by Reynolds conformed with the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacturing and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at a standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yield.

He may testify regarding the development of specific technological advances used in general reduction, such as expanded tobacco, which was invented by Reynolds and first implemented in the marketplace in the 1960's as a design tool that enabled the development of cigarettes with lower tobacco weight because expanded tobacco reduces rod density. Dr, Gentry will discuss the reductions in FTC "tar" and nicotine yields that accompany expanded tobacco since the amount of tobacco burned is reduced.

Dr. Gentry will discuss the ways in which Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies and how these techniques are used in the marketplace today, In support of such testimony, he will cite to examples such as reconstituted tobacco, which was first used commercially by Reynolds and is now utilized by most tobacco companies globally. He will discuss how reconstituted tobacco inclusion reduces both FTC "tar" and nicotine yields, and the limits to the amount that can be utilized in cigarette manufacture due to consumer acceptability. In addition to discussing general reduction broadly, he will testify to the incorporation of these techniques over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Gentry will discuss the modifications that Reynolds made to its products in response to greater consumer demand for lower "tar*" products, coupled with government and public

43-pgNbr=535
health authorities advocating this approach as a means to reduce the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify how the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds and the domestic cigarette manufacturers have substantially lowered the FTC "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will testify that the sales-weighted FTC "tar" and nicotine yields per cigarette have fallen nearly 60% percent since the 1950's, from approximately 38 mg "tar" and 2.8 mg nicotine per cigarette to approximately 12 milligrams "tar" and 0.9 mg nicotine today. He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing and launching low "tar" and/or ultra low "tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Gentry will also testify that general reduction decreases the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns. With respect to low tar products,.he will also be prepared to address such topics as smoker compensation and Reynolds' research in this area.

Dr. Gentry will testify regarding Reynolds' efforts to address the public health concerns of smoking by means of selective reduction. He will explain Reynolds' work in identifying and quantifying the target compounds of interest and consequently developing technologies to expedite specific chemistry reduction and create products that were commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will also discuss the ways in which Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years, including its historic and current efforts, technologies and products, such as carbon filtered cigarettes. Dr. Gentry will testify about Reynolds* commitment to developing technologies and products with

-44-pgNbr=536
the potential to address the risks associated with smoking with the development of "heat-not-bum" products, such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also discuss innovation in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique,

Dr. Gentry will testify that Reynolds cigarettes have been developed and manufactured with recognized state-of-the-art methodologies and practices at all times during the last six decades. He may testify about Reynolds' research efforts on alternative or novel cigarette designs, including attempts to modify Wnicotine ratios in response to requests of members of the public health community, including the U.S. Surgeon General. As part of those efforts, he will discuss Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and others. He will also address Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments for the. development of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no governmental authority, public health group, academic institution, scientific establishment or private entrepreneur has ever developed any superior alternative cigarette design, even though the subject has been extensively researched for decades.

Dr. Gentry will testify about Reynolds' efforts to develop novel products such as Premier and Eclipse, as well as its efforts to develop reduced risk products. He will discuss alternative cigarette designs and the lack of consensus among government, scientific, medical and public health communities as to which test, battery of tests or other evaluation approaches should be used to determine if one cigarette design may present less risk than another. He will testify and describe Reynolds' product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Gentry may also discuss studies in smokers by Reynolds, including yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

-45-pgNbr=537
Dr, Gentry may testify regarding allegations of nicotine manipulation. He will be prepared to address the topics of smoke pH, "free" nicotine, and the use of ammonia. He will testify that Reynolds has not manipulated nicotine, altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine, or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will opine that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase mainstream smoke pH or "free nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using the FTC method.

Dr. Gentry may testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding Reynolds* cigarette research and design efforts, He may also offer testimony in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Gentry reserves the right to amend this disclosure,

Why was that? 9      A   St. Augustine had more mall volume and you io   just-] don't really have an answer for that. You n   just made regular faster than you did In Waycross.

12               Waycross utilized a lot of casual clerks,

13     And by casual I mean they could hire off of the street K for a certain period of time and they weren't required is   to provide them with benefits.

25

592

-Rasas

593

Q  30 years Is one way that you can get fully vested pension benefits, right? A That's correct. Q  And what was the other way? A The other formula I'm not  I'm not familiar with. I do know there are  there is two formulas. I don't know, I can't answer that question,

Q And how old was Kenny when-and I'm sure the record will reflect this someplace,

But do you know how old he was when he ii   started working for the post office In Waycross? 12      A  Well, we can do our math. He was 44 when he is   died, end he worked for the post office 19 years. 14      Q  Okay, So basically at age 55 he would have 16   been fully vested for his pension; is that right? And

9     should go for SPO or postmaster? io      A  1 did not.

ii      Q  So you're Just saying that that's something

12     thafs theoretically possible, but It's not something

is     that he expressed an Interest in achieving, right? 14      a  He never did to me. 16      Q   Sorry to go back on this, The lawn service

16     that you use, how many years have you been using a

s     one pack of cigarettes per day form your estimate as

3         Q when did you start riding together?

4         A   I would have to get that information to you.

5     That would be when 1 made regular and we started going fi     to work -- or I started then at 3:00 in the momlno-

11     again, I  I can find out when I started regular and

12      let you know.

13               MS. POLLACK: I don't believe I have any

14          other questions.

15               MR, PARRISH: I have a follow-up.

16                     REDIRECT EXAMINATION

17     BY MR. PARRISH:

18         Q These stops at this convenience store to get i     coffee and cigarettes 

20         a  Cigarettes, not coffee,

21         Q  And you feel comfortable looking a Jury of

22     your peers in the eyeball and telling them not once in

23     12 years did you not  did you not stop at that store

24     and your husband not buy a pack of cigarettes; is that

25     correct?

617

MS. POLLACK: II object to the form. A  It wasn't 12 years. It would have beenif it was in '88, then he was sick two years, so It would be six years. Q   Same question with six years. A  Yeah. Yeah. Could 1 swear that he stopped * Q  Yes, ma'am.

 every morning on the way? Yes, ma'am. No, I could not,

That*$ what you testified to when your lawyer asked you. A   I said the days that I was with him. Q  Let's amend that question then. Do you feel comfortable looking a jury of your peers in the eyeball and saying that every day that you were with him for six years and you went to work that he stopped and bought a pack of cigarettes? A  To my recollection he did.

MR. PARRISH: Okay, Thafs all for now. Everybody done?

Ms. Frailey, there's a man- - Ms. Fralley. MR.V1NIK: Wrong plaintiffs.

MR. PARRISH: I'm sorry. I know. I

wwtwwMiwmwww'Hwm'iwwwwwwwwftH

618

1         apologue.

2              There's a mandatory Instruction I need to

3         give you now that the deposition is finished for

4         today. It's still technically - there's a chance

a         we may come back depending upon whether you produce

6         any more documents, but its largely completed.

7         And I think we can go ahead and close this session

8         out if it's okay with the rest of the lawyers..

9              So this deposition will be typed up, the

io         transcript will be typed up, and you have a right

ii        -I assume your lawyer wants you to review the

         transcript.

13              MS. POLLACK: (Nods head.)

14              MR.PARRISH: So what you'll need to do is, is         when Ms. Borden is done with the transcript and

16         its ready to be looked at she'll make

17         arrangements for you to come down here and look at la         the transcript and review It and you can fill out

19         an errata sheet. I'm sure your lawyers are going

20         to want to go over that with you.

21              So If you talk to your lawyers, they will

22         explain that to you further, but you do have a

23         right to, and I think your lawyer wants you to

24         review the transcript, and consider filling out an

25         errata sheet.

Subject:      The WINSTON ProMew

!%.;    >i: * iViemorandum.:.

One:    January 7, 1983

To:  C, R, DI Marro

From:  A fan Rndgman

The discussion at a recent RtD Directors' meeting of soot consumer perception problem* vlth the current WINSTON 85 and the possible need for a progran to improve this WINSTON raises the question whether the Information generated In past WINSTON improvement work is being copletely used*

In late 1977, Marketing became concerned because the WINSTON was losing marVet share vs the Marlboro 65 and more and wore consumers described the WINSTON a* harsh and irritating* The Marlboro vac generally perceived as alld and smooth. (You tiay be interested in the following piece of history! in 1970 and 1971, Research proposed  project to work on the improvement of the WINSTON, Both timet, funding was denied for the project* The second proposal in 1971 was rejected with.the comment, "By definition there can be nothing wrong with the WINSTON 65!")

In response to the 1977 concern,  vessive WINSTON improvement program was mounted in R&D early in 197$. This program involved over 40 people, lasted elftost two years, and, froa the results obtained, was a fine example of cooperation between Research personnel and Development personnel (old organlration)i The program comprised soae doten interrelated projects. The major ones are listed belovt

t Detailed examination of the changes isede In the WINSTON li  and Marlboro 65 during the previous decade when the Marlboro 65 rose frow relative obscurity, passed the WINSTON 65 in narket share, and becatte the Mo. 1 cigarette In the U.S.A.

  The T/N ratio of the Marlboro Increased fron *K to M6j the T/N ratio of the WINSTON regained constant at about 14;),

a The nicotine delivery of the Marlboro decreased fro M.5 to M og| that for the WINSTON retained relatively constant at M.3.

  The smoke pH of the Marlboro Increased froa 5.9 to 6.1, that for the WINSTON regained constant at <vS.9i

  The huneetent level of the Marlboro was increased end became substantially higher than the WINSTON* Thlt reduced Marlboro moisture loss vs the WINSTON during shipping and in retail outlets during the shelf storage period*

  The freshly siede Marlboro va* at v!3X uoieture whereas the WINSTON was at M2X; the Marlboro 85 had better nolsture retention properties than the WINSTON 85.                                                         g

I. Definition of the optimum T/N ratio for the WINSTON 85.

                                       

The T/N ratio for the WINSTON *5 Md remeintd relatively constant at U,0-14,5 for the preceding decade; the T/N ratio for the Marlboro 85 had increased almost linearly from M* to M6 during the same period. Appropriate blend Adjustment in the V1NST0N 65 increased the T/N ratio to M6. (The T/N ratio can be reduced from about 18 to 8 at the "tar" delivery for a clgrette U decreased from 16 to 1 mg without much loti In consumer acceptability. The current WINSTON 85 delivers 15-16 n|; I doubt that the optimum T/N ratio for this cigarette la 1*, the lowest T/N ratio for the WINSTON 85 since the late '60s).

The optimum nicotine delivery for the WIKSTON at T/N * 16 In terns of consumer response w*s found to be 1.0-1.08 me, not the 1.2 5-1.55 mg/elgt delivery for the 1977-1978 WINSTON 85.

  The harthness/irrltancy of the WINSTON 85 smoke could be substantially reduced by increasing the tobacco moisture level from 12 to liX during naming and Improving moisture retention by humcctsnt level modification, improved pack seals, etc. For most TF cigarettes, loss of moisture during shipping And/or shelf storage Increases the harshness/irrltancy and nicotine level of the smoke*

t The tobacco flavor of WINSTON 8S smoke could be Improved by

substitution of a more flavorful Turkish tobacco such  Xrolr for  less flavorful one such as Italian.

. . l ^/(   The mildness/smoothness of the WINSTON could be Improved by <^VlJ^.4   /    Incorporation of C7A into the blend} the smoke pH was alio increased t,       I  to 6.2-6.3 and the p)l did not decrease with Increasing puff volume.

Furfural is generated during the tfmoklng proc*is from tobacco sugars and cellulose; there'Teemed no need to add more.

  Humerous analyses (glass capillary CC) of thejSarlboro 6$ over a long period of time indicated that it contained  level of menthol not detectable by the routine menthol analysis. Hi "ublieUnel* menthol  ^

. As you can well Imagine, fill of the experimental work described above required substsnttel panel and n^lyticaI support.

Individually, each finding provided a wy to Improve the WINSTON 85; tome were obviously more effective than other*. The three findings with the greatest ipect on WINSTON 65 Improvement Appeared to be T/N control, moisture level control during making and marketing, and Incorporntlon of C7a,

Incorporation of all these and other findings Into the WINSTON 65 resulted In  cigarette known Internally as the WINSTON ft, This was the first WINSTON 85 since t*he late *60s/early '70s to* be rated superior overall to the Marlboro 85 and the first to be rated at parity or dlrectionally superior to the Msrlboro 85 among Marlboro smokers. (Marketing personnel, not R*D personnel, conducted" tlurVon'sumer test s^d evaluated the results))* Subsequently, the WINSTON I was further modified slightly to give whet vas called the WINSTON C and WINSTON D.

Re-exers(union of the wealth of Information and data generated during the" 1976-79 study will surely provide clues to the laprovenent of the current WINSTON.

Implementing another maaslve WINSTON 65 improvement program of the dimensions of the one in 1976 will, In my opinion, result In 'reinventing the

wheel".

Many of the people involved in/responsible for the early study have subsequently been reassigned to other tasks as have some of the R40 brand people responsible for maintenance of the WINSTON 65 brand in 1978*60; e.g., Barnhtll, Cundlff, Johnson, McKemie, Shannon, Guess, Woods, Neumann, Lloyd, Rice, N. J. Wallace, Green, Schumacher, Newell, Best, Harris, Dlckerson, l> Levis, Roberts, Bernssek,, Winfrey, Sensebaugh, Flehl, Stowe, Rodgmen. However, many are still available to provide valuable Input about the 1978-79 work to those currently responsible for the WINSTON 85,

There are also many RSDR, ft&DK, and Interoffice Memoranda available which .''describe the results and conclusions from the experiments described above, and these sre readily available to the current Mb WINSTON 65 brand people*

Cigarette Warning Labels

Health-warning labels have been required to appear on all cigarette packages sold In the United States for more than 40 years.

The Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 required the following health warning, prescribed by Congress, to be placed on all cigarette packages sold in the United States;

CAUTION: CIGARETTE SMOKING MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH,

This warning appeared on cigarette packs from Jan. 1,1966, through Oct, 31,1970.

In 1969, the Public Health Smoking Act of 1969 required all cigarette packaging contain the statement:

WARNING: THE SURGEON GENERAL HAS DETERMINED THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR HEALTH.

This warning label appeared on cigarette packaging from Nov. 1,1970, through Oct. 11,1985.

The Comprehensive Smoking Education Act of 1984 amended the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act by requiring cigarette manufacturers and Importers to display on a quarterly rotating basis the following four health warnings on all cigarette packages;

Smokeless Warning Labels

Current law requires smokeless tobacco to carry warning labels. The law also bans all advertising for smokeless tobacco on radio and television. This legislation became law In February 1986. In October 1986 the Federal Trade Commission Issued regulations that put the law Into effect.

These warning labels are required for packages and advertisements. Rotated quarterly, label size Is determined by the shape of the product, sf2e of point of sale graphics, or size of advertisement, with warnings set at 20% of visible area for advertisements and at 30% for the two principal sides of the packaging. The labels read;

Guiding Principles and Beliefs

Balancing the Desires of our Stakeholders

At RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company we operate our business in a responsible manner that best balances the desires of our many stakeholders. Our Guiding Principles arid Beliefs seek to reflect the Interests of shareholders, adult tobacco consumers, employees and other* stakeholders. In particular, RJ. Reynolds Is committed to addressing the Issues regarding the use of and harm associated with tobacco products In an open and objective manner.

Tobacco Use & Health

   Cigarette smoking Is a leading cause of preventable deaths In the United States., Cigarette smoking significantly Increases the risk of developing Jung cancer, heart disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema and other serious diseases and adverse health conditions.

   The risk for serious diseases Is significantly affected by the type of tobacco product and the frequency, duration and manner of use,.'

   No tobacco product has been shown to be safe and without risks. The health risks associated with cigarettes are significantly greater than those associated with the use of smoke-free tobacco Bhd nicotine .products.

   Nicotine in tobacco products is addictive but Is not considered a significant threat to health.

   It is the smoke Inhaled from burning tobacco which poses the most significant risk of serious.   ' diseases.

   Quitting cigarette smoking significantly reduces the risk for serious diseases,

   Adult tobacco consumers have a right to be fully and accurately informed about the risks of serious diseases, the significant differences In the comparative risks of different tobacco and nlcotlne-based products, and the benefits of quitting. This Information should be based on sound science.

   Governments, public health officials, tobacco manufacturers and others share a responsibility to provide adult tobacco consumers with accurate information about the various health risks and comparative risks associated with the use of different tobacco and nicotine products,

Tobacco Regulation & Communication .

   Tobacco products should be regulated In a manner that Is designed to achieve significant and measurable reductions in the risks and adverse health effects associated with tobacco use. Regulations should enhance the Information available to adult tobacco consumers to permit    . them to make Informed choices, and encourage the development of .tobacco and nicotine products with lower risks than existing cigarettes. .

   The degree of regulation should be based on the risks and comparative risks of tobacco and nicotine products and their respective product categories. Preferential treatment (taxation, marketing, consumer communication, labeling, etc) should be given to tobacco and nicotine products or product categories that are less harmful than cigarettes.

   Communication Bnd interaction with adult tobacco consumers regarding their brand choices Is essential for effective competition.

t Public policy should allow communication of the comparative risks of tobacco products andpgNbr=599
encourage tobacco con&mers to either quit or switch to lower-risk products. : The regulation of marketing of tobacco products should be consistent with constitutional protections and enhance an adult tobacco ..consumer's ability to make an Informed choice by providing accurate Information on the risks and comparative risks of tobacco products,;

   The marketing of tobacco products should not be targeted to minors and non-tobacco consumers.

   The.prohibition of tobacco products Is neither practical nor desirable,

Tobacco Consumers

   Individuals should consider the conclusions of the U.S. Surgeon general, the Centers for Disease Control and other public health and medical officials when making decisions.regarding

   The best course of action for tobacco consumers concerned.about their health is to quit, Adults who continue to use tobacco products should consider the reductions of,risks for. serlqiis diseases associated with moving from cigarettes to the use of smoke-free tobacco or nicotine products.

   Minors should never use tobacco products and adults who do not use or have quit using tobacco products should not start.

   Adults who smoke should, avoid exposing minors: to secondhand, sm,oke, and adult .smokers .. should comply with rules and regulations designed to respect the rights of other adults,

Harm Reduction

   Reducing the diseases and deaths associated with the use of cigarettes serves public health . goals and Is In the best Interest of consumers, manufacturers and society. Harm reduction

.should be the critical element of any comprehensive.public policy surrounding the health consequences of tobacco use.

   Significant reductions in the harm associated with the use of cigarettes can be achieved by providing accurate Information regarding the comparative risks of tobacco products to adult tobacco consumers, thereby encouraging smokers to migrate to the use of smoke-free tobacco and nicotine products, and by developing new smoke-free tobacco and nicotine, products.and other actions.

   Governments, public health officials, manufacturers, tobacco producers.and consumers should support the development, production, and commercial Introduction of tobacco leaf, and tobacco and nl.cotlhe-based products that are scientifically shown to reduce the risks associated with the

In a sense, the tobacco industry nay be thought of as being a specialized

highly ritualized and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry.   Tobacco

products, uniquely, contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug with a varied

z of physiological effects.   Related alkaloids, and probably other compounds,

with desired physiological effects are also present 1n tobacco and/or Its s

Nicotine is known to be a habit-forming alkaloid, hence the confirmed userol0

,tobacco products is primarily seeking the physiological "satisfaction" deri

from nicotine -- and perhaps other active compounds.   His choice of product 

teg

and pattern of usage are primarily determined by Ms Individual nicotlrfe     5^

uS

dosage requirements and secondarily by a variety of other considerations      <p

05 including flavor and irritancy of the product, social patterns and needs,,  *->

<  *~ physical and manipulative gratifications, convenience, cost, health consfiertifSom

and the like.   Thus a tobacco product Is, In essence, a vehicle for dellftoffior

nicotine, designed to deliver the nicotine In a generally acceptable andg  8

attractive form.   Our Industry is then based upon design, manufacture and $aJK

of attractive dosage forms of nicotine, and our Company's position in our   |g i

US'. Industry is determined by our ability to produce dosage forms of nicotine whitt 

H 5-

have more overall value, tangible or Intangible, to the consumer than those Qe ' of our competitors,                                                                                               |.| I

The habituated user of tobacco products is said to derive "satisfaction?!-}

S3 from nicotine,   Although much studied, the physiological actions of nicotine";

are still poorly understood and appear to be many and varied.   For example, in

different situations and at different dose levels, nicotine appears to act as

a   stimulant, depressant, tranquilizer, psychic energlzer, appetite reducer,     o

contradictory effects attributed to it.   Many of these same effects may be

achieved with other physiologically active materials such as caffeine,

alcoholt tranquilliers, sedatives* euphorics, and the like.   Therefore, in

addition to competing with products of the tobacco industry, our products     

z may, in ft sense, compete with a variety of other products with certain types j

of drug action.   All of these products, tobacco and other, appear to have     $

certain common attributes in that they in used largely to relieve, in one    *

way or another, the fatigues and stresses which arise in the course of existeS

Happily for the tobacco Industry, nicotine is both habituating and <p unique in its variety of physiological actions, hence no other active materials or combination of materials provides equivalent "satisfaction". Whether  aj nicotine will, over the long tern, maintain Its unique position Is subject m* to some reasonable doubt. With Increased sophistication of knowledge In 8 15 the biological and pharmaceutical areas, a superior or at least equivalent   Q

product or product mixture may emerge. For this reason, It would be a mlstaleg to assume that the tobacco industry, as we now know it, is Immortal or that t\z

* mi

direct competition from organizations outside of the tobacco industry will Be ver occur. It 1s safe to assume, however, that nicotine will retain its Hz unique position throughout the present ten year planning period, and probablsz for a much Tonger span of time.

develop new data on such things as the physiological effects of nicotine, the rate of absorption and elimination of nicotine delivered in different doses at different frequencies and by different routes, and ways of enhancing or diminishing nicotine effects and "satisfactions".   In the absentee of such data, we may survey the market and conclude that current cigarette  ^j " products delivering about 1.3 mg. of nicotine appear to "satisfy" the typlcalg smoker.   This, somewhat crudely, establishes a target dosage level for desicg5 of new products.   An accompanying Research Manning Proposal describes that|| approach in some detail.   However, if we knew more about nicotine absorption?" action, elimination, enhancement and the like, it should, in theory, br     P possible to more precisely specify, and deliver, the optimum amounts of nicottfig

activity In sophisticated products which would be more satisfying and to the user.   This area merits consideration and activity.

desjra?

Before proceeding too far In the direction of design of dosage formgffiS nicotine, it may be well to consider another aspect of our business; that 1g

the factors which induce a pre-smoker or non-smoker to become a habituated gj-j smoker.   Paradoxically, the things which keep a confirmed smoker habituated^

and -satisfied", I.e., nicotine and secondary physical and manipulative

gratifications, are unknown and/or largely unexplained to the non-smoker.   lg

reliefs, andcertalnly he does not start to smoke to satisfy a non-existent

craving for nicotine.   Rather, he appears to start to smoke for purely        %*

P to psychological reasons  to emulate a valued Image, to conform* to experiment,

to defy, to be daring, to have something to do with Ms hands, and the like,

Only after experiencing smoking for some period of time do the physiological

"satisfactions" and habituation become apparent and needed.   Indeed, the first

smoking experiences are often unpleasant until a tolerance for nicotine has been developed,   This leaves us, then, in the position of attempting to design and promote the same product to two different types of market with two different sets of motivations, needs and expectations.  The same              

situation is encountered in some Industries, but the problem 1s usually not jL as severe.                                                                                                                 

[f what we have said about the habituated smoker Is true, then products!!

designed for him should emphasize nicotine, nicotine delivery efficiency,    

SP

nicotine satisfaction, and the Hke.   What we should really rake and sell   85

<o would be the proper dosage form of nicotine with as many other built-in .    0jjj

attractions and gratifications as possible - that 1s, an efficient nko^ne^g

delivery system with satisfactory flavor, mildness, convenience, cost, erc.gj?

On the other hand, if we are to attract the non-smoker or pre-smoker, thtVeyk

'   8  58 is nothing in this type of product that he would currently understand or     Mg

desire.   We have deliberately played down the role of nicotine, hence the   gg non-smoker has little or no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer h1i| and no desire to try it.    Instead, we somehow must convince him with whollytg irrational reasons that he shfuld try smoking, In the hope that he will for|o himself then discover the real "satisfactions" obtainable.   And, of course,!^ the pre$ent.tdvertising climate, our opportunities to talk to the pre-smoke^ are increasingly United, and therefore. Increasingly Ineffective.   Would it not be better, in the long run, to identify in our own nfnds and in the wJni&S of our customers what we are really selling, i.e., nicotine satisfaction? This would enable us to speak directly of the virtues of our product to the    9 confirmed smoker, and would educate the pre-smoker, perhaps Indirectly but     S effectively, In what we have to offer and what 1t would be expected to do      g

for him.                                                                                                                     *

But again, the picture Is not quite all that clear.   Critics of tobacco-products Increasingly allege that smoking Is dangerous to the health of

the smoker.   Part of this alleged danger 1s claimed to arise from Ingestion k

o

of nicotine and part Is claimed to arise from smoke components or smoke       j "tar".   If, as proposed above, nicotine Is the sine qua non of smoking,       |j and if we meekly accept the allegations of our critics and move toward        < reduction or elimination of nicotine from our products, then we shall eventu|fe liquidate our business.   If we Intend to remain in business and our buslnessoiS the manufacture and sale of dosage forms of nicotine, then at some point we 55 must make a stand.   We should know more, rather than less, than our critics <^ about the physiological, effects of nicotine, and we should In all ways   *     scientifically validate and speak to the beneficial effects and "satisfec|1oft derived from use of nicotine.   Essentially all commercial drugs give rtsetogj* some undesirable side effects, but we continue to use them with great berafi^y to humanity because of their overriding beneficial effects.  Might we not taf a leaf from that book in our approach to nicotine?   Unless we do, our long-1 prospects become unattractive.

(

Our critics have lumped "tar" and nicotine together in .their allegatio about health hazards, perhaps because "tar" and nicotine are generated toge In varying proportions when tobacco Is smoked.   An accompanying Research      50 Planning Memorandum suggests ah approach tb'reducing the amount of "tarp 1n eg a cigarette smoke per unit of nicotine.   That is probably the most realistic approach 1n today's market for conventional cigarette products.   However, another more futuristic approach is possible which goes more directly to the fundamentals of the alleged problem.

CLAIMS THAT CIGARETTES ARE ADDICTIVE IRRESPONSIBLE AND SCARE TACTICS

WASHINGTON, D.C., - aearly, the report Issued by the Surgeon General's office today is politically rather than scientifically motivated, After all, the Surgeon General's opposition to smoking Is well known, as Is his goal of a 'smoke free society by the year 2000."

Today's report is extensive and will require review before any specific comments can be made, however, general comments are In order,

The claim that cigarette smoking is a drug addiction similar to cocaine, heroin, or alcohol use is irresponsible, The message to the American public, and In particular American youth, Is that using illegal drugs, such as crack or heroin, or alcohol has the same risk of addiction is smoking. To convey this message it to invite disaster and trivialize the serious drug problem faced by society,

If young people believe the government and equate heroin addiction with smoking, how can they possibly understandthe true horrors of drug use and withdrawal? If, instead, one recognizes the Surgeon General's report for what It Is, a biased "scare" tactic, then what credibility will be given to reports by the government on real drug use? Young people see others giving up smoking every day. If they see the government is not telling them the truth about giving up smoking, then why should they believe Ihe govemmnet on the effects of illegal drugs?

The claim that cigarette smoking causes physical dependence Is the heart of the Surgeon General's Report. But this Is also the heart of Its weakness. After years of well-funded research, it has not been established that cigarette smoking produces a physical dependence to nicotine, in fact, it has been impossible to establish that the feelings persons have upon giving up smoking are anything but .that which would be expected when one is frustrated by giving up any desired habit,

The Surgeon General has repeatedly stated that his goal is a smokeless society; that he believes smoking is one of the most addictive drugs in society; and he has voiced his support for persons suing tobacco companies. Consequently, It is not reasonable to expect that a report coming from his oifice would be objective in 1(5 views on the subject of cigarette smoking behavior.

Ironically, the Surgeon General's own figures indicate that more than 40 million Americans are former smokers, 95 percent of them having given up smoking without professional help. That doesn't mirror any common-sense description of addiction.

Smoking is truly a personal choice which can be stopped when a person decides to do so, The result of this report is likely to be a distrust of government pronouncements on hard drug use, and the providing of an excuse to persons not to give up smoking since, according to the Surgeon General, giving up smoking is as difficult as giving up a .drug addiction.

HISTORICAL REVIEW Of Wd PH DATA m SALES TRENttFOR COMPETITIVE BRAND FILLER CIGARETTES

OBJECTIVE;

The object of this work was to compile all available smoke pH data measured during the past years on competitive brand filter cigarettes and attempt to correlate these data with cigarette sales trends.

Smoke pH data for competitive brand filter cigarettes measured since 1964 were complied. Relatively complete pH data were available for the years 1964-1972 for WINSTON, SALEM, Marlboro, fool, Kent and Viceroy cigarettes, A comparative study of the smoke pH, FTC "tar*1, and nicotine for these brands was made. The results show'that since 1964 the smoke pH for the Marlboro and Kool cigarettes has been steadily Increasing, while that for the other brands studied has remained almost constant. The FTC "tar" and nicotine has decreased for all brands studied at about the same rate, Thus, all the brands have about the same FTC "tar11 and nicotine, -but the Marlboro and Kool are stronger due to a higher smoke pH.

*

Correlation studies of smoke pH and sales trends between 1964 and 1972 were made for each brand. For WINSTON* pH values were determined on freeier-stored cigarettes manufactured between 1957 end 1964, and a correlation study made over the period from 1957 to 1972. The results of these studies show that there Is a very strono positive correlation between smoke pH and sales trends over the years studied.

A high pK smoke Is strong due to a high concentration of unbound, or

free, nicotine In the smoke. Calculations of the unbound nicotine In the           u

smoke of the brands studied were made and used as relative measures of                 S

strength for the cigarettes. Correlation of these values with sales trends       3 were made end the results showed even stronger positive correlations than

were found for smoke pH-sales trends studies.                                                                     h

INTRODUCTION

Competitive brand testing of smoke pH was started In 1964, Prior to that date work on pH was being dona In the Analytical Division, but no reports on competitive brand analysis were Issued. The results reported from 1964 to 1967 Were determined by the pad pH method. From 1969 to 1972 the Standard Combination electrode method reported by Sensebaugh end Cundlff was used (1). The pH measured by the pad method Is lower titan that determined by the standard method* However, since no reliable correction factor was avall6ble, the values were used as reported. The pK value used from the standard method analyses was the average peak value.

Relatively complete pH data were available for only a few brands, and even these brands were not measured every year. For this reason the WINSTON, SALEM, Marlboro, Kool and Kent brands were selected for thorough studies. For the years In which no data was available values were measured on freezer-stored cigarettes If available,

FTC "tar11 and nicotine values were obtained from reports by Giles (2) and Robinson (3*4)

The available data for the years 1957-1972 are listed In Table I. A graphical comparison of the smoke pH for the competitive brands between 1964 and 1972-U shown In figures 1 and 2.

Correlation of Smoke pH and Sales Trends

Snoke pH measurements on WINSTON were made back to the 1955 WINSTON using freezer-stored cigarettes. The stroke pH for the years 1955 through   jj 1972 Is shown plotted along with sales results for those years In figure 3.  ^

Smoke pH end sales results for the years 1964 through 1972 are plotted A for Marlboro, SALEM, Kool, Kent and Viceroy In figures "4, 5, and 6.  -   g

fre'e ,or ynbounq- Nicotine

As the smoke pH Is Increased the amount of free nicotine In the smoke Increases. For example, at a smoke pH of 6.0 about )5f of the nicotine In the smoke Is In the free, or unbound, form, At pH 6.5 about 5* of the nicotine Is unbound and at a pH of 7.0 approximately 15* Is free. Since the unbound nicotine Is very much more active physiologically, and much faster acting than the bound nicotine, the smoke at a high pH seems to be strong In nicotine (5). Therefore, the amount of free nicotine In the smoke may be used for at least a partial measure of the physiological strength of the cigarette.

The smoke pH and nicotine data were used to calculate the amount of free nicotine In the smoke of the WINSTON, Marlboro, SALEM, Kool, and Kent cigarettes for the years 1957 through 1972. The smoke pH of Marlboro and Kent for the years 1957*1963 were assumed to be the same as that for WINSTON, and the smoke pH for SALEM and Kool was taken to be 6.0 for those years. These

ere not bad assumptions In light of total nitrogen and total super data for those years,

The results of these calculations are shown plotted along with sales results for the same years In figures 7 and $'

The available analytical results from competitive brand analyses for total nitrogen, total sugar and ammonia on WINSTON, Marlboro, SALEM, and Kool ere shown In Table II.

In reviewing the data measured over the past years severe I Interesting points which are not obvious from viewing the graphs and tables as presented were noticed,  One was the methods used In the Marlboro and Kool cigarettes to control smoke pH,   In the case of Kool the amount Of sugar used In casing was much lower than that used on SALEM*  Sugar Is very effective for reducing smoke pK,   The smoke pH of Marlboro was controlled with a combination of low sugar relative to WINSTON and chemical additives (ammonium phosphate) applied to the reconstituted tobacco sheet.

Another Interesting observation was that the Kool began Its rapid growth In 1965 and 1964. At thts time the total sugar In SALEM was very high and as a result the amount of free nicotine tn SALEM smoke dropped below that In the Kool smoke and has remained below since. Thus, the physiological strength of the nicotine In the smoke from a Kool has been higher than that from SALEM since 1963, which Is the year SALEM seles leveled off and Kool sates began e sharp end sustained Increase.

In 1963-1964 the sugar level In Marlboro was reduced relative to WINSTON and the free nicotine In the Marlboro smoke Increased to a level above that In WINSTON.   In 1965 the total nitrogen In Marlboro Increased above that In WINSTON, Indicating the first addition of ammonium phosphate to the reconstituted'sheet, Since that time the free nicotine In Marlboro smoke has been higher than that In WINSTON and sates have been sharply Increasing.  Total nitrogen and ammonia analyses on 1967-1972 Marlboros Indicate that additional eirmonlum phosphate was added.In 196B and 1969.

Correlation of sates end free nicotine In the smoke from Kant cigarettes Indicates that there may be a critical level of free nicotine, below which only t> limited number of smokers will accept.   In 1959 the free nicotine In Kent smoke dropped to about 0,010 tng and has not been above 0,018 since,  Sales for Kent leveled off In 1959 and have been on a slow decline since.

K "A historical review of smoke pH of competitive brand cigarettes has shown that the Marlboro and Kool cigarettes have had higher s^oke pH than the other competitive brands since 1964*

j

2,  The smoke pH for Kool has been high due to the use of relatively low levels of sugar In the casing. The Marlboro has maintained a high pH by using a combination of relatively low sugar and ammonium phosphate additive on the reconstituted tobacco*

3,  Over the years studied there was a very strong positive correlation between smoke pK and sales. An even better correlation was observed between free nicotine In the smoke and sales*

4,  The physiological strength of a cigarette, which may be controlled to son* degree with stroke pK,ls extremety Important,

ith DR. E. CUYLER HAMMOND

Director of Statistical Research, American Cancer Society

IS THERE PROOF THAT SMOKING CAUSES CANCER?

Are statements that cigarette smoking and lung cancer go hand In hand really true? Just what evidence Is there and what does it prove? Are there any other things involved besides cigarettes? And what progress Is being made in the search for a final solution to the problem of rising lung-cancer rates?

To get the facts on the subject, U. S. News & World Report interviewed Or. E, Cuyler

Q Does smoking really cause lung canter, Dr. Hammond? People ore laying till sorts of things About cigarette smoking-*

A That's just what we me trying to find out. There is some evident* that it may be so. For example, material collected 'from cigarette smoko wll] produce cancer on the Klein of a susceptible mouse If you. keep up the experiment long enough. Tlmt's nn Important piece of information, but taken alone it doesn't prove n thing about the occurrence of lung anoer in human beings. It hns to be weighed together with other evidence and we ore still collecting information.

Q In other fields of research in this couritry~on other forms of canoer-aie you doing this same type of statistical detective work?

A Some. Lung cancel' is the one wo arc doing the most work on, because it is the only type of cancer whloh is increasing rapidly in age-adjusted rates,

Let me make something dear-all forms of cancer rtc increasing, in that more people die of them each year. But that Is'primarily because cancer is a disease largely of later life, and our population is aglng-we are getting a larger number of old people in the population. For that reason, and that reason alone, most form* of cancer arc' increasing in number of deaths each year, But lung cancer is the only form of cancer in which there Is a very great rise In the death rate after correcting for age, There ore a few others that are rising slightly, and a few that are going down slightly.

Q Is lung cancer always fatal?

A Not always. It is rtiore highly fatal than some of the other forms of cancer. It is one of the. most fatal. By and large, the cancers that ore internal and in vital organs are more apt to cause death than those, such as skin cancer, whloh are on the surface, One reason Is that those on the surface are more easily diagnoscd-you can see them and get to them. Another reason is that cancers In vital organs are more difficult

Hammond, who heads one of the most extensive research projects in all medical history. Through this research a scientific effort is being made to determine the truth about whether smoking causes lung cancer.

Or, Hammond at present is director of statistical research for the American Cancer Society and is also professor of biometrics at Yale University,

to treat, The over-all survival rale for those who get lung cancer is around 5 per cent at the present time.

If we can persuade everybody-partioularly men over 45-to take on X-ray screening test every year, we think we will raise the survival rate considerably; at least we hope so.

Q How many cases are there In a year now?

A About 32,000, but it is on the increase,

Here we are speaking of cancer that originates In the lung*.. A considerable number of cancers In other parts of the body spread, and the terminal cause of death is sometimes a cancer growing in the lung that didn't originate there. Ordinarily, the term "lung cancer" refers only to cancer which originates In the lungs,

Q Oh, you don't call It lung canoer if-

A No, not unless it originates in the lungs. Cancer spreads throughout the body, but we name the type according to where It originates,

Q What Is the lung-cancer rate among women as compared to men?

A Oh, there is no question tliut the lung-cancer death rate is much higher in men than in women, very much higher. I could give you the actual figures on it-it is about 5 to 1.

Q And yet women have become smokers In greater numbers in recent years than men-

A But too recently for the full effect to become apparent. If smoking causes lung cancer, arid if, furthermore, it takes about 20 years of heavy smoking to do it, then what is known about the smoking habits of men and women over the past 20 years would pretty well account for the difference, because women didn't start smoking heavily as early w men did,

Q You are the head of a research project that is going to try to find the answer to the question of whether smoking causes lung cancer?

A Right. At least we think that It will provide important evidence leading to an answer.

A Multiplicity of Suspects . ?  How the Research Is Being Handled    What's Been Found Up to Now

Q Is that the largest project of Its kind at present in the country?

A As far as .1 know, it's the largest projeot of that general type that's ever been attempted on any disease, About three weeks ftgo the U. S. Public Health Service started a somewhat similar study which may be about as large. We began our own study more than two years ago.

Q Is your project large because of the number of people involved in it or because of the money being spent?

A Because of the number of people. We

are doing the project largely with volun-

teers-we have 22,000 volunteers working

 for us. They interviewed 204,000 men,

all between the ages of 50 and 69.

O Who are the people doing this work?

A The volunteers of the American Cancer Society.

O When did this take place?

A The actual interviewing started on Jan. 1, 1952, and most of the men were Interviewed within six weeks, but we continued interviewing until June, 1952.

Q And this js a project to find out what you can about whether long cancer is caused by smoking or not-

A Well, Irs aotually a little more than that. We are undertaking the projeot because there is reason to suspeot that smoking may cause lung oancer-we don't know it, but there is good reason to suspeot it. Now, what we have aotually done is get the smoking history from a very large number of men. We selected white men in order to avoid bringing In the oon-fusion with raoe, because the death rate is different in the different races,

Wc took the age group 50 to 69 only because the lung-cancer death rate is highest in that age group. If we had chosen younger people, the study would have taken at least $0 years. Having taken the case histories while the men were still well, wo think they are unbiased-that is, their answers were not influenced by emotion, Then we are following them up for the next, several years, and about 3,000 of them die each yeav-the number is going up because they're getting older. The first and most important question is whether amok* ing affects the death rate.

Q That is, whether people who smoke die faster than people M'ho don't smoke-

A Yes, that is the first and most important question, There U pome reason to suspect that the death rate may be twice as high among heavy smokers as among non-smokers, Tills is based on past evidence, but we don't Know yet, and we want to find out on a large sample,

Then the second thing: If smoking has such an effect, we

DR. HAMMOND

want to analyze it by causes of deauVand, of oourse, the major oauie we we interested In Is rung cancer,

O How do you choose the people to be interviewed?

A In the first place, we limited the study to nine States-New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New York, Michigan, Uliuois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, and California. All of those States have reasonably good diagnostic facilities, We didn't go anyplace where the diagnostic facilities are very bad.

Seoond, we had to go to places where there were a lot of men in the age group 50 to 69, Within those States we then selected 394 oounties on the same basis, being sure to include both rural counties and urban oounties. We questioned people in Pittsburgh, Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago and several other large cities, Wo nlso got them from rural counties such as in the upper peninsula of Michigan, which Is about as far removed from Any industry as anyplace you can think of. We then had our volunteers question men that they knew reasonably well and would be able to follow-that is, they wouldn't lose track of them. They Just didn't go out and question people in the street.

In rural counties and small towns there was virtually no selection on the basis of social-economic conditions, or that type of thing, because in n small town everybody knows everybody else and they oan,all be followed.

Furthermore, in some States the looal radio and press were of tremendous help tp us when we were questioning the men, In a few counties of Wisconsin, for example, they broadcast every 16 minutes, asking men to come In and give their smoking history. In om6 of the oonnties we obtained very nearly a 100 per cent coverage on all the men in that ago group from the area. So that in those places there was no selection, prao-ttoally speaking. Now, it Is true that there was some selection in the cities,

Our volunteers for the most part are of the middle or upper* middle social-economic group. So there was some selection in' the soolal-eoonomic classes among their friends. But it's also true that fraternal'orders helped us and church groups helped us with the lower economic level. Some labor unions and soma plants helped us. Well, we know all those facts, and so for eaoli group we know what sort of people we ure dealing with. Q When you have a selection like that-selecHon of State, selection of county, selection among the people therhselves-how do you know that you have a representative and statistically valid sample?

Interview

"It is possible that smoking has some beneficial effects'"

A In the first place, we don't need a representative sample. What we do need to know is the facts about the people we question,  *

Q There Is no need to have a group composed half of smokers and half of nonimokers?

A I suppose, if there had been any feasible way of doing so, we might possibly have only taken people who smoke very heavily and people who don't smoke at all, in order to get a quick general answer to the question, But In order to ascertain people's smoking habits, you have to question them. Once having questioned them, there Is no good reason to eliminate moderate smokers from the sample. The real confusion is going to be among people who have mixed smoking habits-for example, those who smoke a pipe for a while, then cigars, then stop smoking, and then start cigarettes.

Q Now that you have this, what happens next?

A Once a year, in November, we have each of our volunteers give us a report on all the men the questioned, She merely tells us whether the man is living or dead as of No* vember 1, If he died, she tells us the date and place of his death, We then get the dead) certificate from the Health Department, If the death certificate mentions cancer of any type, or a respiratory disease of any type, then We go back mid get additional information from the doctor who signed the death certificate. When possible, we also look into the hospital record and pathological reports to got the most accurate information on the cause of death,

0 How much does ft cost to do all of Oils?

A I don't think you can put a dollar figure on it. The major work is done by volunteers, and the work they have done for us would have cost several million dollars if we had had to pay for it, The main cash expenditure has been for traveling; that is, getting in touch with the volunteers, But we have a staff that travels to get in touch with the volunteers anyway, rind I don't think that any great amount of traveling was done on account of this study that wouldn't have been done anyway. We have meetings of volunteers to teach them about cancer.

AN ANSWER-SOON?-

Q How long do you think it will take before you get a result from your research?

A Wo may have enough information from the follow-up tha was started last November-it takes several months to complete the work-to get an answer to the general question of whether death rates are higher among smokers or nonsmokers. It will probably take one or two more follow-ups before we will be able to make an analysis by oause of death.

But I'll say this: If, practically speaking, only heavy smokers get lung cancer, we'll know that in a, lot shorter time than if the effect is not that dramatic, It is easier to distinguish between black nnd white than it is to distinguish between shades of gray,

Q What is your study's criterion of a heavy smoker?

A We don't have a criterion of a heavy smoker at this time. We simply have the facts as to how much smoking the men have done, We are going to divide il up quantitatively nil the way from the heaviest smoking down to the lightest.

Now, as a practical matter we will have to group the men by categories to get an appreciable number of people in each group. We'll probably have about eight or ten groups. But

that's a detail of analysis. There is no criterion of a heavy moker-they go all the way from people who' smoke over four packs a day down to people who smoke none, and there Is no clear-cut dividing line.

Q Supposing that it Is true that the death rate is high among smokers versus nonsmokers, but those people dldnt die of lung atlments-what did they die of that might possibly have a relation to smoking?

A That's the problern-to find out,

Q Might you not find that the death rate among eny group that's set off from .another group tl higher than the other group?

A Quite so, yes, For example, If we find that there is a higher death rate from stomach ulcers among smokers as ojj-posed to nonsmokers-stomaoh ulcers being related to people s nervous dispositions under pressure, and that sort of thing-then it might be due to a mutual oause rather than a cause-end-effeot relationship. That is, the nervousness might both

Sroduoe stomach uloors and oause people to smoke heavily, to.the other hand, the harmful effect of being nervous may be that nervousness causes you to smoke a lot and smoking Jn turn produces stomaoh ulcers-you can't tell without more evidence.

However, If we find,that smoker have high death rates from certain diseases, where In animal experiments find In short-term human experiments we can see that tobacco smoke has an effect, then we would be more likely to believe that a cause-and-effect relationship exists. It depends upon what other evidence there it, It may be a mere association, not cause and effect, or It may be oause and effect-nnd we'll need outside evidence to get that settled.

Q How many people in America know anything about this subject professionally?

A I'd say it's a handful of people who have personally done any real work on it', In addition, a number of doctors have gained impressions based upon clinical experience.

Q Do you think this whole thing may lead to the discovery of some way of treating the cigarette so as to eliminate these dangers?

A I hope so. My personal guess right now Is that there is a cause-and-eft'ect relationship between smoking and lung canoer, but I have no idea at the present time whether that Irelationship is trivial-no more dangerous than crossing the streetj for, after all, you may gat run over in crossing the street -or whether it is so important that making cigarettes ought to stop until we find what's in them that Is bad and remove it, But as to whether or not all the harmful ingredients can be removed and still have a cigarette that is pleasant to smoke remains to be seen, I am interested not only in lung cancer, but also other possibly harmful effects of smoking.

It may be that the nicotine Is increasing the death rate from heart disease and that the tar Is increasing the death rate from lung canoer and that something else is increasing the death rate from cerebral hemorrhage. If so, you will probably have to eliminate the cigarette. We don't know yet, It is also conceivable that smoking has some beneficial effects,

SPOTLIGHT ON CIGARETTES-

Q You say you are studying cigarettes. How about cigars and pipes?

A Oh, we are studying ell types of smoking. The reason I have emphasised cigarettes is that it is the sale of cigarettes

64

U. 5. NEW (. WORLD REPORT, Feb. J6, 1954pgNbr=680
warn



"Cancer death rates are higher in city areas'7

which has increased. The sale of cigars and pipes has Increased very little to comparison.

Q Is lung cancer greater, then, among cigarette smokers than among pipe smokers?

A There Is some evidence that that may be so, Just how valid the evidence is I'm not sure, We are studying all types of smoking.

Q And cigars-there isn't any evidence on that either, recently?

A The evidence from studies of hospital patients seems to indicate that cigars and pipes are relatively harmless so far as lung cancer is concerned, but are harmful as to lip, tongue and mouth cancer, whereas cigarettes are harmful for lung canoer-at least that's the indication. It has face validity, as we say, because the tongue, lips and mouth are subjected to the tar and other materia] that'comes out of the end of a pipe aud a cigar In heavy concentration, and pipe and otgar smokers seldom inhale, Very little condensed tar oomes put of the end of a cigarette, but people do inhale the smoke and It comes Into contact with the lungs. So the evidenoe sounds reasonable -not absolute proof, but reasonable.

0 Are you particularly worried about it-I notice you are smoking?

A Well, I feel this way about it: If I get altogether too nervous personally about every problem I am working on, I would be one miserable man, I am not going to let it have any effect on my personal -habits until all the facts are known. Fear is an occupational hazard which must be guarded against by people who are doing research on fatal diseases.

Q If you read in the paper that a lot of people were hurt orossing the street, you might get soared and never cross the itreet-

A That's right. Most people I know who have worked on the subject, including those who think as I do-that smoking very likely does increase lung cancer-most of them are still smoking, if they ever smoked. Some of them have cut down, however,

Q How do you know that a person who died of lung cancer or cerebral hemorrhage wouldn't have died of lung cancer or cerebral hemorrhage even if he hadn't smoked all his life?

A That's why .1 say you have to tie In all the other information on your subject to come to a reasonable conclusion, The only way absolutely to prove it would be to take a large group of people and force half of them to smoke heavily and not let the other half smoke at all; and then put them into the same occupation and same environment and follow them for 70 years. Well, we can't do that. So we have to get all the evidence we can bearing on the subject from such sources as animal experiments, studies of the immediate effects of smoking on human beings, and studies of death rates in relation to smoking.

HOW USE OF MICE HELPS-

0 What about the evidence that has been obtained through mice experiments? Is that very valuable?

A Yes, I'd say it's very valuable, But it is not conclusive in itself.

Q What have mice experiments shown about smoking?

A They have shown that if cigarette smoke Is condensed in a very highly concentrated form and smeared on the skin of mice for a good many months, then a large proportion of the mice will get cancer of the skin.

Q Suppose you smear orange juice or grease or something else on them, wouldn't they get cancer of the skin?

A Well, there are a certain number of substanoes, called carcinogenio agents, which will produce cancer. They're a limited number,

Q What kind of substances are they?

A Most of them are coal-tar products,

Q And If they are rubbed on the tktn regularly, they will produce cancer?

A Yes. But it takes n long time. Usually it takes about a third or more of the normal life span of die animal.

Care Needed In Drawing Conclusions

Q Can you Jump to the conclusion that, fust because coal-tar products can produce cancer on the skin of an animal, it will olso do the same thing Internally?

A No, you cannot At least, that's my opinion. Various parts of the body differ In their susceptibility to cancer. Furthermore, something which affects a mouse does not necessarily have (he same effect on a man, For this reason, it is necessary to study the human population. But such studies are by no means easy.

For example, try studying cancer death rates versus urbiinl-2ation, and you find that by and large the cancer death rates are considerably higher as recorded In olty areas than in the country, Furthermore, by and large, they are higher in the richer sections of the country than they are In the poorer sections, and putting it on a world-wide basts, you find that the most backward countries have the lowest cancer death rate reported, That may be due to mere difference In diagnosis, because in the rich areas there are more doctors and so you got more correct diagnoses, Therefore, that evidence in itself doesn't show necessarily that city living, with exposure to coal-tnr produots, onuses the higher cancer death rates.

Q How much higher is It m the city than it is in the countryP

A If we're tulleIng about lung cancer, it's over 2 to 1 among males,

Q Would you say there are lots of differences between people who smoke and those who don't smoke?

A Probably. Therefore, once you establish that there is a difference in the death rate between smokers and nonsiuokers, in either direction, then you have to look nt other evidenoe to determine whether it's a cause-nnd-effeet relationship or whether it is due to association with other factors. But, at least, you have a lead to work on.

Now, the importance of animal experiments Is this: Suppose we find that heavy smokers have a much higher lung* cancer death rate than nommokerx. If you could not produce cancer by smoke, or anything from tobacco, then you would suspect that you were dealing not with n' cause-and-effect relationship in the human population between smoking and lung omu'Ci, but some other associated factor. Maybe smokers nre more apt to go to a doctor to get diagnosed for hing cancer, for example. But since you can produce cancer expert mentally in animals by something from a cigarette, then you would be more inclined to think that a cause-and-effect relationship ulits,

Where something has to be operating for a wry long time to produce results, either favorable or unfavorable, it is very, very difficult to ascertain the true facts, because too many things have happened In the world in the last fcO years, (Continued on next pnge)

. "Tobacco smoke contains a lot of poisonous agents"

The factors In the environment which produce cancer probably have io operate for-oh, maybe, 10, 15, 20 or 30 years before canoer occurs, But, now, if we think back over the last 30 years, look at all the things that have happened in that time, and many of these things are correlated with each other,

Q What things are you referring to?

A Oh, a tremendous number of things have changed which could conceivably be related to canoer. For example, dietary habits have changed. People now get more vitamins, whioh promote normal growth, and It is conceivable that this promotes abnormal growth alio. Men in this generation are usual* ly taller than their parents, Air pollution has increased, Deaths from infectious diseases have decreased and perhaps people who die of cancer today tend to be the sort of people who would have died of an infectious disease in an earlier perjod. More people have desk jobs than previously, and there has been a population shift from the farm to the factory.

Innumerable other examples could be g!ven~and it is difficult to separate the wheat from the ohaff In trying to ascertain what factors are primarily responsible for changes in death rates from various diseases. Then, too, certain environmental factors are associated with each other. For example, some years ago only rich people could afford to smoke cigars but this was only one of many ways in which the rich tended to differ from the poor,

Q In what age group is a rise showing?

A Well, in all ago grovps~for lung cancer, that is. This graph I am showing you here does not reflect the rise which took place merely due to the aging of the population, If I showed you. that,1 the'rise would appear to be much greater,

Q If you took the general population as a whole, and charted the lung-cancer increase, It would go up to one level, whereas if you took only the age group who would be more subject to lung carreer and chart the rise In that age group, you would get a different and more correct answer?

A That is right- In thost forms of canoer, if you plot the trends, showing each five-year age group separately, there is little or no rise, but if you throw all age groups together, and simply calculate the over-all death rate, there is a rise. This is so because the death rate is much higher In old people than in young people, arid there are proportionately more old people in the population these days.

This particular graph is corrected for that factor, It shows that the death rate for lung cancer is rising even after correcting for the aging of the population. Something must be causing this Increase. There is no change in heredity, Therefore, changes in heredity cannot account for the rise. We are guessing it is something in the envlionment-thereforc we have move clues to \vork;on than in the case of other forms of cancer,

Now, with reference to a previous question, we ore doing more statistical research on lung cancer than any other form of the disease because, since the death rate Is rising, it is a fair guess that there Is something in the environment Suit is causing It, and this environmental factor is probably also on the increase.

HEREDITY'S PART IN CANCER-

O It hasn't been proven, has It, that cancer is hereditary? A There is some evidence which seerns to indicate that heredity plays a part, Q But not in all oases? A Well, there Is probably a hereditary factor in virtually

every case to some degree. But human cancer is probably not inherited in the ordinary sense of the word,

Q Is there a hereditary factor in every disease?

A Yet, to some degree. As a generalization, it may be wid that every disease Is the manifestation of a reaotipn between en individual and his environment (the environment containing such factors as bacteria, viruses, and chemical agents). Therefore, the nature of the individual as influenced by heredity is always a matter of Importance, You can breed a strain of animals in which cancer cannot be produced by any known

Krocess, And there are other strains of animals that have a igh number of spontaneous cancers, and are very susceptible to carcinogenic agents. I'd guess that human beings vary from one extreme to the other. But human beings do not intermarry in their own'families in such a way as to produce pure strains of high or low susceptibility,

0 Are there animal experiments showing any ill effects from smoking, besides those involving putting coal tars on the skin? You've had some inhaling experiments, haven't you?

A Yes, but the difficulty is that if you try to expose them to a very high concentration of smoke, many of the animals die before canoer has a chance to develop. One experimenter has reported an increased inoidence of lung cancer among animals which survived the acute effeots of a high concentration of tobacco smoke, but the type of cancer was not the same as the common type of lung cancer seen in human beings.

Q They choke to death?

A I suspect that the people doing the experiment gave the animals a good deal higher concentration of smoke than a person would ordinarily get, I suspect that the animals were killed by carbon monoxide, but I'm not sure. You see, tobacoo smoke contains a lot of very poisonous agents, and the most poisonous of the lot is carbon monoxide. Now, there is no evidence whatsoever that carbon monoxide causes lung cancer, but carbon monoxide in high concentration is a deadly poison, as you know.

Q Isn't (hat largely what happens if you take too much of anytblng-for example, mashed potatoes? Or if you take too much aspirin?

A That is one of the difficulties. If you depend just upon animal experiments, you have to argue from extremes, An argument will run something like this111 deliberately use a ridiculous example-lf you hold somebody's head under water, he'll drown, Therefore, using the type of argument some peoples use, drinking any water is bad for you.

So that type of argument-to use a pun-doesn't hold water, In a problem of this sort, you have to collect information from every source you can think of, I think the most important is to see what happens to the human population.

Now, if the death rate from cancer is no higher among smokers than among nonsmokers in the human population, you can forget the whole business. But if there is n difference, then you should loot to other evidence, such as animal experiments, to determine whether you are dealing with a cause-and-effect relationship or whether you are dealing with associated causes.

EFFECTS OF JOB, DIET-.

Q By "associated causes," do you mean that the thing that causes the person to take up smoking might be the real cause of his death?

A Yes, It might be that. Or it might be that heavy smokers,

66

U. . NEWS & WORLD WOK], P.b,  ywpgNbr=682
"For some cancers, pipes are worse than cigarettes"

because they cough, are wore apt to go to the dpotor for diagnosis and therefore more lung oanoer is diagnosed ajnong heavy smokers. That would be the sort of thing I am talking about, Or it may be something like this: Feople in certain occupations cannot smoke because of their occupations. Maybe tliey are very safe occupations. All sorts of correlations of that type are possible.

Therefore, you have to look at laboratory evidenoe, and that is the importance of the laboratory experiment Nothing done on the mouse is going to prove that the same thing happens

}     to a man, but, at the same time, if the animal experiments tie

i,     in with your observations on man, and all other evidence ties in, then you can be reasonably sure of your couolustons. If

-     they go In opposite directions, then you arc not at all sure

     how to interpret it.

If the Appetite Is Poor

Q Isn't it also true that among these associated factors In smokers is the fact that they may not be eating properly because of the way smoking affects the appetite? j A Yes. But that, then, would be a direct effect of smoking. We are not talking about the mechanism here. Let us suppose that people who smoke heavily don't eat properly and are therefore more apt to die.

Q Then the responsibility would bo smoking, but not the cigarette. The cigarette Itself wouldn't produce the death-

A That's right, But, nevertheless, smoking would be bad for you in that case. For example, probably one of the worst things about heavy drinking Is that people who drink very heavily-the real chronic alooholios-ftio praotioally on starvation diets, They stop eating and they get serious vitamin deficiencies. But still the drinking is responsible.

Q Isn't it true that a lot of women feel that'smoking keeps them from overeating?

A Yes, and then their diet U just awful. They starve themselves and cat the worst sort of food in many instances.

Q So that the cause of their troubles would be an improper diet rather than the cigarette? ^

A A combination of the two! You couldn't distinguish~un-leus you had outside evidence that smoking per se in an experimental animal had resulted in death. Now, in heart disease there are some immediate effeots of smoking. Smoking oauses an immediate contraction of the blood vessels, It also causes the speeding up of the heart rate.

Now, that doesn't kill you immediately. But whether having your heart rate continually stimulated over a matter of 30 years and. having a continual abnormal contraction of the vessels will eventually have the cumulative effect of causing death from heart disease is anybody's guess.

If we do find e larger death rate from heart disease, arteriosclerosis, cerebral hemorrhage, or something like that, among heavy smokers, what we know of the Immediate effect of smoking would make me think we were dealing with a cause-und-effect relationship find not merely an association of the type we were speaking of a few minutes ago,

Q What we know is of a short-range effect, but we don't know about the long-range effeots-

A Right, We can study the long-range effects in animals

experimentally where the animal does not have too long a life

span. There we can eliminate the association. We can make

. one animal inhale smoke and keep another animal from doing

it. You can't do that with a human being..The animal experiment can be carried out In two or three years, while a comparable study on human beings would take a generation.

IS TENSION A CAUSE?-

Q In all the studies of oanoer, U there anything that indicates statistically whether people with tension, what they call the nervous types, are more prone to oanoer of any kind?

A I don't know of any specific study that would answer the question with certainty one way or the other, Some of the studios have Included all typos of cancer, not Just lung cancer, and. there is no evidenoe whatsoever that heavy smoking increases the death rate from any sort of cancer, except of the lung, lip, tongue, and mouth.

Now, it is known that tobacco smoke contains something whioh can cause canoer-at least In mlce-and it only causes cancer In that part of the body with whioh it comes in contact, Smoke comes In contact with the lung,

If we should find that the death rate from lung cancer is much higher among heavy smokers and the death rate from other forms of cancer is not one bit higher among heavy smokers, then I'd say that the evidence would be extremely strong that there Is a oause-and-effeot relation,

You see, the other forms of oanoer act as a control. Cancer is something that happens to an individual cell, Nervous tension might cause a change in hormone secretion, or something of the sort, and if that alone would inorease cancer in one part pf the body, it would probably Increase cancer in any part of the body. It would be a. general phenomenon, There'o be no reason whatsoever to suppose that it would affect the lungs and no other part of the body.

0 W you establish that there is some relationship between lung cancer and smoking, why wouldn't you also have an increase in mouth cancer or cancer of the larynx where the smoke comes in contact? '

A There is come evidence that smoking increases the incidence of cancer of the lip, tongue and mouth,

0 But this Is the same type of evidence that you've been talking about-

A Yes, the same type of evidence/There is also some evidenoe that for those types of canoers, cigars and pipe* are worse than cigarettes, whereas for lungs the cigarette is worse, Mind you, this evidence Isn't ell perfect, But it is reasonable enough, because in the pipe and cigar you ' have! a great amount of Juloe oomlng in direct contact with the tongue and the lip. And very few people inhale cigars and pipes,

HOPE TO PROVE SOMETHING-

Q As a smoker yourself, are you trying to prove anything one way or the other?

A I am not trying to prove anything. 1 am just trying to ascertain the facts, I hope 1 am disinterested, There's one thing, however-every research worker Is probably prejudiced to a slight degree, in that he hopes that he is going to get definite results of some sort, He may not care which way they go, but be does hope he gets something. And to that extent I guess I'd have to admit that I am not completely disinterested. Of course, I hope to prove something by all of this-I wouldn't have gone to all the work otherwise.

Q What Ingredients dc we find in each of these things you tave on this Chart? For Instanoe, in the asphalt you say there ire tar produoti-

A Asphalt dust has not been studied at much as some of he other things, but it is definitely one of the suspects, It is /ery likely that some of the tars, oils and asphalt used in road lurfaotng contain carcinogenic chemicals,

Q What about fuel oil?

A Fuel oil and soot from opal-well, soot from coal was he first thing ever discovered that produces cancer in man as veil as in experimental animals. There's no question that soot n produce cancer.

Q Aren't there studies that show that people living around Hictoriet where a lot of soot comes out have moire lung cancer han people In other areas?

A The trouble with such studies is that the American popu-ation moves too much and things change too much. It prob-tbly takes 20 years for a low concentration of something like joal soot to cause cancer in man, and these studies in America ust don't mean much,

A It was noted, iriany years ago in England, that there was t lot of oanoer of the scrotum among chimney sweeps, where-is cancer of this part of'the body if a rare disease in the (eneral population. The scrotum tends to be moist, and that Is wrhaps the reason that it was affected by soot more than other >arts of the body, It wai rightly concluded that the soot iaused the cancer,

Q It was because they were perspiring?

A Possibly, Chimney sweeps may also have had more skin Mincer, but the actual observation was cancer of the scrfl-utn. The reason it was noticed is that; cancer of this rt of the body was an extremely rare disease among ither people. Then, following that, laboratory workers took root from coal and oil and smeared it on the skin of tnimals and it produced cancer, Practically all we know ibout cancer-producing agents originated with that obser-ration on chimney sweeps, That Is why anybody ever worked with soot in the laboratory,

Later, chemists separated spot into a number of different >hemioal factors, and it was found that oertein specific hernials caused cancer when smeared on the skin of an animal,

Q What about the smog we hear about now?

A That is composed partly of coal tar and oil products, but 0o of other products from Industrial plants.

Q Have you any evidenoe as to whether smog Is producing wmoerP

A Not direct evidence. But then, who's been exposed to leavy smog for 20'years? Look at the increase in motor vehicles as shown on the graph. Not only has the number of notor vehicles Increased, but traffic has become more jammed jp. About one milligram of a specific, known carcinogenic

from auto fumes"

agent Is produced every minute that an automobile motor fa Idling.

Q If you. have proven carcwogenie agents in cigarette smoke and also have them In what people breathe every day, hew can you tell whether ft b the cigarette smoke or the pollution in the air that Is causing lung oanoer?

A There would be no way of tolling if all the Information you had was what is. shown on those two charts. In the abseaoe of other information, you might very likely conclude that the inhalants have caused an increase in lung cancer, but have also caused an even greater decrease in death rates from pneumonia, influents and pulmonary tuberoukwli. Therefore, you must gather other pertinent information, as I have said before,

We know that treatment has lowered the death rates from the infectious diseases of the lung, although it is conceivable that smoking has played some part In the decline, At least this cannot be ruled out as a possibility without more evidence than we have at present Laboratory evidenoe indicates that all of the inhalants named could possibly cause lung canoer, But the laboratory evidenoe in itself does not establish what actual* ly occurred In the human population,

In the case of cigarettes, we have additional evidenoe from studies on the smoking habits of lung-cancer patients. We are now checking the validity of this evidence, If it turns out to be accurate, then there would be little doubt that cigarette smoking causes lung canoer. This does not rule out the possibility that other inhalants also produce lung cancer, Since air jv'-lution from automobile fumes only became heavy in the last few years, (he full effects may not become apparent until 10 to 20 years from now,

I mentioned the decline In death rates from the infectious diseases of the lung primarily to show how cautious one has to be In interpreting parallel trends. From about 1040 on we would have no difficulty explaining why the death rate from

Eneumonia has gone down, The antiblotloa and sulpha drugs ave had a great effect, In the period just baok of that, wed have said it was the serum treatments. The decline, however, started before the wonder drugs and serum came in. Wo have something to account for here,

Q You have something to account for, but you're not certain what?

A We are not certain that this whole trend for this length of time can be accounted for fully on the basis of more effective treatment-roost of tt, yes, but not necessarily all of it, For example, there may have been a change in the virulence of the disease-producing organisms. Conceivably smoking was a contributory factor, but more evidence wCuld be needed before one could possibly draw the conclusion. This merely illustrates the difficulty in determining all the faotors responsible for changing death rates from specific diseases,

CIGARETTE. PNEUMONIA FOE?-

Q Is there any laboratory evidence that cigarette smoking may be related to the decrease in death rates from pneumonia?

A Yes, some evidenoe. If you bubble the smoke from three cigarettes through a solution containing millions of the bacteria which cause Type I pneumonia, all of the bacteria are killed, This does not prove that Che same thing would happen in the human lung. Nevertheless it Is interesting and more work should be done on the subject.

Lung cancer was a rare disease before 1920"

Q You spoke of poisonous agets-of toxic agents, Would An individual build up a tolerance to those over a period of years, or would they be cumulative and bo more poisonous?

A As a generalization, the body builds up a tolerance for toxic agents, if administered In small doses over a long period of time. In some instances the opposite occurs, Cancer-pro* diioing agents tend to be cumulative in their effect.

0 Could the carbon particles in a cigarette cause cancer?

A No. My guess is that they would be protective. Carbon particles have the property of adsorbing various chemicals on their surface. You can make very effective gas masks that way, If there are a lot of toxic agents In tobaooo smoke, a considerable portion of them may be adsorbed by the carbon particles and deactivated on that account. The carbon might neutralize, as it were, some of the harmful agents, However, there Is not enough evidence to give a definite answer on this point.

Q If you prove that there is a definite relationship bo* tween tobacco and cancer, would it be likely that you would also be able to Qnd the agent that causes it, and if you find it, can you remove it?

A I hope so. I'm not too optimistic, Wc, have no Idea whut it is, and there is this possibility-it may not be a single specific chemical. There are a good many benign tumors In people's lungs, and also it seems likely that some lung cancers can go on for a great many years without oausing death or serious difficulties. And if a person gets such a thing at the time he is, say, 60, he is apt to die of spine other disease before the tumor causes trouble.

Perhaps the chronic Irritation of smoking causes ti dor* mant cancer to start growing. If this is the mechanism, then cigarettes probably could not be made safe. This Is a pessimistic view, I hopo that a substance will be found after the removal of which cigarettes will be safe.

Filters? "We Don't Yet Know"

0 How effective are filters in removing harmful mate* rials from cigarette smoke?

A Nobody will be able to give a complete answer to that question until all the harmful materials In cigarette smoke nre identified by chemists unci tested on animals and human beings. Some filters remove a considerable proportion of the nicotine, and nicotine is probably quite harmful. Filters now in use probably do not remove carbon monoxide and it may be that this is the most harmful factor in tobacco jimoke. Some filters remove a portion of the tar and perhaps they remove tho cancer-causing fraction but this is by no means certain, Filters may, or may not turn out to bo the solution to our problem; we don't yet know.

Q Let's assume you had .statistics which show that smokers get lung cancer In greater proportion than nonvtnokers. Would you have figures to show how many of the parents of nonsmokert died of cancer, so that the factor of horedity coulrj be taken into account?

A Well, If you are talking about lung cancer specifically rather than cancer in general, then it is practically certain that not many of the parents could have had Jung cancer In either group, because lung cancer was a rare disease before about 1920.

0 Yes, but again, if we assume that there were cases of cancer, would your figures show the hereditary cancers among those smokers and mmsmokers?

A Well, now, I would be extraordinarily surprised if there Is only one factor operating. 1 think it much more likely thnt

there Is a combination of factors, and that susceptibility varies. Not everybody that smokes heavily gets lung cancer, remember. And. for that matter, not everybody who Is exposed to con* tagloim diseases get those diseases. There are difference8 ln susceptibility. I mink heredity undoubtedly Js important, but It Is not thnt easy to get the answer on It

0 Arc you giving weight to the fact that there are othor things In n cigarette besides tobaooo? ' A Well, to my mind the first questiw. to answer Is, what ciooK tho cigarette, as now made, do? The cancer-wasing factor could perhaps be something in the paper, or It may be tho arsenic sprays that are used on tobacco, or it may come from tobacco itself, Wc arc trying to find that. Work is now going on at New York University, In which they are fractionating the material condensed from.tobacco smoke, and trying to determine which fraotton causes cancer when applied to the skin of a mouse. I understand that they hope to have the answer In a year or two from now. I certainly hope that they xuoceed.

HOW X RAYS CAN HEIP^

Q How would it be If people got X-rayed In the mobile units that test for tuberculosis-would X rays show up lung cancer?

A They usually do, but not Invariably.

Q What can you do when signs of cancer do show up?

A Operate,

Q Operate tor what?

A Operate to remove the lung that has the cancer. An early cancer of the lung Is quite curable. However, the difficulty is that It Is seldom found early. Until we find a way to prevent lung cancer, we are doing the best we can to get earlier diagnosis through X-ray screening, and persuading people to see their doctor as soon as they have symptoms, so they will have the best possible ohnnce of being cured,

Q Do you think that smokers should .have X rays of tener than nonsmokert?

A That's a leading question if there ever was one. My answer is yes. So long us there is even a strong suspicion that smoking chums lung cancer, a heavy smoker Is very foolish If he docs not havo a chest X ray taken twice a year.

Rut everybody should get them-smokcr or nowmaker. You should have an X my at least once a year, if you are over 45, or particularly if you nre over 50. If you are a timid soul, then you should also give up smoking at least until tho facts are known.

0 is it conceivable that persons who live in the city and who Inhale soot of various kinds and are heavy smokers ere more likely to die of cancer than those who live In the country and nre heavy smokers?

A 1 think it is more likely thutt not. Soot and fumes In addition to cigarette smoke would probably have more effect than either one alouo,

Q In other words, a factor might be added in the city? For instance, If you had the samo statistics for heavy smokers, it might show different results?

A Yes, It is quite possible that no one of the three things-smoking* automobile fumes or soot-alone has. a sufficient quantity of carcinogenic agents to produce lung cancer, but all of them added together might be sufficient to cause lung cancer. Even so, one of the*o factors might be far mure im* pnrtnnt than tho othors,

"We can't do anything about heredity-only environment"

Q In other words, yo would have to, for statistical pur-poses, go out on a farm, And tome of these farmers that never leave the farm, and never ride a tractor, and never get any carbon-monoxide fumes, and ne\er get any soot, and yet heavy smokers, and compare them with heavy smokers somewhere else in order to get an answer?

A That is what we will have to do,

0 You will have that?

A Practically speaking, yes. Statistically we-will have It, though we don't have the whole life history of the people we me studying, Jn America people move around so much that if you question them they will tell you-

Q Then It Is un oversimplification to sov that results among heavy smokers show one thing, and among non* smokers show something different?

A You have to analyze the evidence in detail.

Q And you have to toko all the surrounding factors into consideration?

A Yes, in so fnr as possible, I think you will agree with this: Let us say that two things must be present In order to produce lung cancer, and let us say those two things are an in-herited susceptibility and very heavy cigarette smoking over a long period of time, Now if you eliminate either one of these, either the inherited susceptibility or the exposure to tobacco, then you wouldn't get lung cancer, But we can't do anything about heredity-the only thing we con control Is the environ* ment. So, although yon could say on a technical bnsls that

it wasn't smoking alone that caused it, from a practical standpoint you would say that cigarette smoking caused it.

Now suppose that you have to have exposure to fumes from an automobile, plus cigarettes, plus coal soot In order to get lung cancer-m that event, removing any one of these factor* would solve the problem. Or maybe smoking four packs of cigarettes a day, without exposure to automobile fumes would be the same as smoking one paok of plgarettes plus exposure to Rutomoblle fumes, Some people seem to think this Is a simple problem to answer. They look at It In terms of o very simple eanse-nnd-effeet relationship, with only one factor Involved,

I am afraid we have a multiplicity of causes, and the question isi U there one cause so muoh more Important than the rest of them that removing that one will practically solve the problemP That's the thing we have to find out,

0 Do you think your studies will show that there is one big cause, or will they show that there Is a multiplicity?

A If smoking is the principal factor in the causation of lung cancer, our study will certainly show it We do not know yet.

People ask us if we are making progress, How do we know? For example, If It turns out that smoking oauses lung cancer, then our present Activities may be called "making progress," But if the results ore negative, then it will be said that it was another false lead we tried. You can't tell whether you are making progress until you get the final answer. In other words, you can only tell in retrospect,

What Britons Are Told About Smoking

Here's what Britain's Mulder of Health, loin Moclaod, told (fie House of Commons on Feb. 12, 1954, whan asked about the relcffonsh/p between smoking end lung concert

Mr. lain Macleod: The Standing Advisory Committee on Cancer and Radiotherapy have had this matter under consideration for three years, As a result of preliminary investigations, a panel under the chairmanship of the Government Actuary was set up in 1953 to inquire and report. I have now been advised by the Committee in the following terms;

"Having considered the report of the panel under the chairmanship of the Government Actuary on the statistical evidence of an association between smoking and cancer of the lung, and having reviewed the other evidence available to them, the Committee are of opinion !-

"(1) It must be regarded as established that there Is a relationship between smoking and cancer of the lung.

"(2) Though there is a strong pre* sumption that the relationship is casual, there ia evidence that the relationship is not a simple one, since;-"(a) the. evidence in support of the presence in tobacco smoke of a carcinogenic agent causing cancer of the lung is not yet certain; "(b) the statistical evidence indicates that it is unlikely that the increase in the incidence of cancer of the lung is due entirely to increases in smoking;

"(c) the difference In incidence between urban and rural areas and between different towns, suggest* that other factors may be operating! e.g., atmospheric pollution, occupational risks, "(3) Although no immediate dramatic fall in death rates could be expected If smoking ceased, since the development of lung cancer may be the result of factors operating over many years, and although-no reliable quantitative estimates can be made of the effect of smoking on the Incidence of cancer of the lung, it is

desirable that young people should he warned of the risks apparently attendant on excessive smoking. It would appear that the risk Increases with the amount smoked, particularly of cigarettes." I accept the Committee's view that the statistical evidence points to amok* tng as e factor in lung cancer, but I would draw attention to the fact that there is so far no firm evidence of the way in which smoking may cause lung cancer or of the extent to which it does co. Research Into the causes of lung cancer has been pressed forward by the Government and by other agencies in view of the Increase in the incidence of this disease and we roust look to the results of its vigorous pursuit to determine future action.

I should also tell the House that before these recommendations were considered by Her Majesty's Government the tobacco companies had offered to give 250,000 [$700,000] for research. They have, on my advice, agreed to offer this money to the Medical Research Council,

Low-Risk Cigarettes; A Preseripfloh

Low'toxicity ctgaretleshoid significant* promise h the prevention of diseases related to smoking.

During (he last 30 years, epidemiological studies have established that different patterns of cigarette smoking behavior lead to quantitative, differences In smotce Inhalation and have shown a direct relationship between dose and risk of disease </,7):

After almost 300 years of experience) smoking hasbecome ing rafned'to nearly all'coltures, As a result of this, two recent decades ofanlbmokhsj education In our society have met with only partial success: today tf to CO million Ameft cans stillismoke. and the habft appear* to be Increasing among teenagers and women (ft

For the ca*vol smoker,, the kinesthetic and cultural aspects of the habit may be easily forgotten, but for the serious imokflr-mlmOKf Invwiobly the problem smoker at high rbkof diseaie^the pharmacologic,, physiologic, and hedonistic rewards are not easily overcome, even with strong motivation.

Since smoking occupies such e<promi-nent position In the mythology of our dally life, it is unrealistic to expect that a society of nonsmokers could be created after a mere 20 years of public education, particularly In the prevailing sociopolitical climate; historic perspective suggests that many, decades may be needed to-chlfcve this goal.

Until then, it is Important to protect those who continue to smoke despite ulf * warnings, lieavlngthem to (heir late is neither humane nor economic, particularly whan there ij. evidence (hat their risk can be reduced substantially in at least two ways.

First. It may. be possible to- remove toxic smoka components selectively and thus reduce specific hazards. Second, the well-established dose-response evl-dence suggests that, if the totalilntnke of!

smoke In the population can be reduced, after an appropriate time a reduction'tn disease Incidence should alio occur, is demonstrated for smokers of Ither cigarettes {4)j, Many studies (W)t Indicate that a combination of these two approaches Is feasible, limited only by the market constraints of cigarette acceptability, and by the dynamics of taste and perception modification in the consumer,

Rtductlw ef toxic Smoke Components

Methods for reducing the smoke yield of cigarettes. Include genetic selection and low fertllizatiofl of plants: growth and harvesting practices that provide "leaner" tobacco leafs; curing methods that remove leaf components; use of high-porosity papers, fillers, and smoke dilution devices; and transformation of* tobacco Into reconstituted sheets through a process that removes-undesirable plant components, adds, Inert diluents, and increases thevolume of the original' tobacco (d, 9~I3), Most of these approaches reduce the amount of "fuel" burned, during combustion, favor more complete combustion conditions, and discourage pyrolysls, pyrosynihesis, and formation of tar. carbon monoxide, and other undesirable, components. In addition,, the tar of cigarettes so processed usually showsdecreasedcarcinogenlelty when tested on an equal-dose basis against the wr of traditional cigarettes In mouse skin assays'to\ 9,16, /7); this Is reflected In the steadily decreasingactlvl-ty of the tors in commercial American cigarettes over the Inst decade (M)i

Although nearly 3000 compwnd.vrmve been identiltcdiln cigarette smoke, only a few have been related to specific tieulih hazards, Hydrogen cyanide Is. compered specifically toxic for the ciliated respiratory epithelium 1/9). The insult of nitrogen oxides may have a rote in acute and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and In the slow development of

emphysema Vi,.20). Various toxic attri-butcs.have been ascribed!to a number of aldehydes and phenols, acrolein In pirtlc-ulor Ifi, 21, V)i The hiurd of these components, however, appears small when" compared to thai of tar, carbon wdhoxide, and nicotine, except is they affect lung clearance mechanisms. Tar b a mixture ofmany chemicals and Is commonly understood* to contain, most smok,rcmoeensi It also contains oth-er Irritants and toxic materials of unlden-tII5ed.properti J,2t, W). Carbon most-oxide Is linked,to the development of cardiovascular disorder* and to acute .toxicity phenomena Q4). the anoxia ft produces may precipitate-sudden death' when an Insufficient myocardium Is overly stimulate4by..nieotitie.(2J).

Nicotine is recognized as a dangerous alkaloid, but, at the doses delivered by cigarettes, the smoker automatically adjusts Intake tofavor pharmacologic and physiologic reward t?d). Except as Indicated abovethe sudden toxicity of nicotine to. a- damaged myocardium in relatively anoxic conditionno chronic . toxicity effects have been clearly and consistettly attributed to nicotine.

Because of its.overwhelmtng.pharma> cotogfc contribution, however,, nicotine plays an important role in controlling smoking behavior. Within smoke the alkaloid exists in Jtoth the proionated and unprotonafed forms.-The fatter form In* creases with Increasing alkalinity of the smoke 0,28) and'appears to be more readily absorbed; more Important still, it has decidedly satiifylhg eftccis on (he smoker's testewoeptor* (24); Within certain value ranges, high levels of nlooilnc, high smoke pK values, end high ratios of unprolonated; to-protonulcd nicotine Increase thesatlbjlon effect In the smoker, tend to depress the consumption of cigarettes and the depth and frequency of Inhalation (26,29),. and therefore reduce the intake of smoke.

Thus It appears that the hazards of cigarettes can be reduced by a simuka- ,t neous reduction of tar and of Its specific ' carcinogenic activity; by a reduction of carbon monoxide, nitrogen' oxides, hydrogen cyanide, acrolein, and othen undesirable toxic smoke components; and by m<adjustment or nicotine levels and proionotlonconduclvetoconsumersotia-tlon.

The technology to achieve these results has been developed and can be applied1 to the manufacture of commercial cigarettes 0, 7, //, 12,14,16, it). Not surprisingly, such manipulations niter traditional flavor patterns and produce various degrees of conflict with established standards of acceptance. The,

The feasibility of let's hazardous cigarette* poses an- obvious- question; Arc there limits of cigarette and :moKe composition that may approach relative safety? In pragmatic terms, these limits can be defined as the smoke Intake doses at which the risk of disease In-smokers Is approximately, the same as In non-smokrs. Various ways, of estimating these values ore availableIn particular., the dose.-response analysts of several 'epidemiological studies and the extrnpo-Ujion-of blood concentrations at differ-ent rates of Intake for certain smoke components, such at. carbon monoxide,

To derive a' doscreiponse relation* ship., epidemiological studies associating dally cigarette consumption In malts with Increases In risk of mortality from 11 specific diwajes.flrtd of mortality in general were analysed {tfHfO. A critical value was estimated from each study,

Thus, a conservative approach suggests using the critical values that apply to all causes of death in smokers. AI-. though-"nil causes'* may include some that are not tobacco related, this comprc-heflstve category represents the effect ot cigarette consumption on mortality In general. These critical values are listed In Table 1,-and'the related critical values ofimoke components are listed In Tattle 3.                                                    .

IT the low critical values of'the range appear difficult to attutn-a smoker could argue that they, amount to a nonsmoking prescriptionthe upper values are In the range of current cigarette marketing and manufacturing realities, although they would necessitate modification of the acceptability requirements of the f moker.

It would be erroneous, to Jnterprtt-these critical values as irtdfcutors.oT safe smoking levels, since the experimental) and statistical: uncertainties of the stud- '', lei surveyed are well known, at In mod ' epidemiological work of this. kind. Also,, regardless, of how fophlMicnied the statistical methods, might- be, the data should not be Interpreted us Indicating safe levels, and special provisions would still be necessary for high-risk groups such as. coal, uranium, and asbestos workers.

Not the least) promise of low-Hazard cigarettes is that a low delivery of nice-  line and smoke will reduce their habit-forming features, and will make it easier for smokers to quit altogether.

Since these approaches are feasible, delays are difficult to justify; the alternative Is the continuation of hundred* of thousands of premature deaths and many more dlf abilities every year.

Summary

Antismoking. educatlbn campaigns In our society have met with only partial success; today 55 to 60 .million Americans smoke, and the habit Is increasing' among teenagers and women, ft is important to protect Individuals who continue to smoke despite all* warnings. There Is evidence that this can be accomplished In at least two ways.

First, it may be possible to remove toxic smoke components and thus reduce specific hazards. Second, the dose-response evidence suggests that, if the total intake of smoke can be reduced, after on appropriate lime.*reduction in disease incidence should occur. The technology to achieve these results has been.developed und can be.applied to the manufacture of commercial cigarettes: noecEMBBR m<-

These cigarettes will-not conform to tra-dklonat- flavor patterns, but! consumer perception can be made to change and compensating flavors and fragrances can be added.

 The feasibility of less, hazardous cigarettes raises the question* of whether there. Ire limits of cigarette and smoke composition thaMnay approach relative safety. These limits can be defined as the smoke intake doses ot which the risk of disease In smokers approaches that m nonsmokers. Such values can be estimated by dose-response analysis of severed epidemiological studies and by ex-trapQlatEoa of blood concentrations at different rates of intake for certain smoke components, such as carbon monoxide,. Critical vafues determined by these methods should not be Interpreted as Indicators of safe smoking levels: they do Imply., however, that a rapid shift In cigarette con8umpiion<habits-toward the proposed range of values wilt make possible a substantial reduction In the current epidemic proportions of smoking-related diseases.

Review o| Inttrnfll Kmrti Rmrding Ctewttt Smoke rtff untf Sflltt Trcn^i

To review internal R&D reports regarding cigarette smoke pH methodology and the relationship of smoke pH to cigarette sales trends.

SHMMAKY;

The history of smoke pH methodology is briefly summarized in this review, particularly regarding the many changes In methodology during the 1960'a and 1970'*, The various approaches to smoke pH measurements make comparisons over long periods of time difficult to interpret. In addition, different researchers appeared to have different ideas of what was the most meaningful of the different smoke pH values that could be measured.

This chronology is important because of an RJR Research Department "finding" in the early 1970's that "high" smoke pH was a characteristic common to several competitive cigarette brands that were showing increasing sales trends. However, using a database that spans over a decade and is based on a consistent smoke pH test method, it appears that sales trends of the 1970*8 were not determined by smoke pH, despite the correlations reported. From this review, the correlations of the early 1970's appear to have been merely coincidental in nature, calculated at a time when certain cigarette brands were growing their market share and their smoke pH happened to be relatively Mgh. There Is no evidence from the historical data reviewed that the smoke pH of RJR brands was purposely increased to enhance sales.

Introduction,

Over the years, a number of different analytical techniques have been employed at RJR to measure the pH of cigarette smoke (e.g., 1-7). The idea of measuring smoke pH is contrary to the classic chemical definition of pH, which is "(t]he acidity or basicity of solutions [is] frequently expressed in terms of a function of the H4 ion concentration..." (8 at 439). Because smoke is an aerosol (solids and liquid droplets suspended in gas phase) and not a solution ("a homogeneous molecular dispersion of two or more substances" id. at 388), and changes its composition and structure quickly as it cools and dissipates, measurement of smoke pH is a difficult task with results of questionable meaning. While extremes in smoke pH can render a product unsmokeable, some researchers in years past have regarded smoke pH as a possible factor in "smoke balance*' that influenced consumer acceptance.

During the period from the mid 1960*8 to the mid 1970's, it appears from the in-house literature that the method or technique for measuring smoke pH was continually revised for improved reproducibility and/or meaning. In 1971, Harrell and Musselwhlte described earlier smoke pH methodology as follows (3):

In previous [prior to -1966] attempts to gain information about smoke pH, cigarette smoke was simply passed into distilled water which could then be subjected to the traditional pH measurements of solutions. However, the single puffin as little as 1 ml of water produced a rather weak mixture and It appeared that carbon dioxide was probably the only compound contributing substantially to changes in pH.

Some reports also refer to "pad pH" or "Cambridge pad pH". In this method, 5 cigarettes were smoked and the particulate matter was collected on a Cambridge pad, The pad was then placed in a given volume of water, and the pH of the solution was measured (9).

Sometime during 1966 or 1967, the general procedure described by Sensabaugh and Cundiff (2) was Mowed, where f([t]he smoke was not collected in water but was allowed to come in contact with a combination pH electrode with a thin film of water on the surface" (3). Yet, within a few years, difficulties with that method were recognized:

"As long as pH values have been evaluated seriously, there have been reservations about their use and uncertainties about the interpretations to be drawn from pH puff by puff profiles...The puff by puff measurement of cigarette smoke pH by the , procedure has been termed an 'an' by some workers because of the difficulty encountered by all but a few in reproducing results. In this study the following factors were found to affect smoke pH values:   (1) moisture and physical               "

characteristics of the cigarette sample, (2) puff rate, duration and frequency, (3)               K

concentration of the smoke around the measuring electrode, (4) any buffering of              *

the electrode, (5) thickness of                                                                                               w

moisture film on electrode, and (6) the pH reading at time cigarette is lighted" (3)-

The puff-by-puffpH measurement provided a number of values for pH, including a minimum and maximum value for each putt An average cigarette minimum and maxhmim, and at times, an overall average pH value, were reported in various studies that used this method, This author has found inconsistencies in, or at times no description o which of these values was used in some reports. It appears mat some show the average value, others use the maximum average by cigarette, while Sensabaugh and Mussehvhhe (10) believed that

*fi]n evaluation of pH data taken from the WRpurT-by-puff apparatus, the greatest emphasis should be placed on the miaimujivalues obtained, since these represent smoke in a more nearly equilibrium state." [Emphasis b original].

The feet that different researchers placed a different degree of emphasis on the various values obtained by the puff-by-puff analysis makes interpretation of data from one time period to another, or from one report to another, very difficult. In addition, Harris and Hayes (7) also point out that

"...since these pH measurements are usually made on a single cigarette per determination and replicate determinations show a reproducibility of + 0.3 pH unjls, accumulation of representative data for a given brand is time consuming.*' [Emphasis added, at 58).

In a comparison of two brands, particularly where the number of analyses or replioations was smalt, the determination of whether the brands display different smoke pH values may be difficult. For example, a given cigarette style could show a smoke pH of 5.7,6.0, or 6.3 in different analytical runs. A second cigarette style might show smoke pH values of 5.6,5.9, and 6.2. While the average smoke pH of each cigarette Is similar, specific values of the range to compute that average may appear to be quite different, for example 5.6 vs 6.3. In limited testing, differences or sfailarkles between two cigarette brands could be misleading.

Sensabaugh and Musselwhite (10) conducted a study in late 1969 and early 1970

"to determine routinely the pH of smoke from production WINSTON c\^ttitt&.,:\ They

conducted multiple tests from a variety of samples, and their data provide an interesting

look at the smoke pH variability possible within one carton (different paoks) and across

cartons ntanu&ctured at the same time. Figures 1 and 2 show examples. Figure 1 shows an

example of the minimum and maximum smoke pH measured from 10 packs within one

carton. (It is assumed that the high maximum vahie reported for pack 4 is recorded

correctly in Reference 10. Even if h is not, the range of maximum pH for the remaining

packs is 0.33 pH units). Figure 2 shows the smoke pH variation over 14 different cartons                   "

produced over the same day. The range for minimum pH was 5,59 to 5.94, and the range                   3

for maximum pH was 5.97 to 6.31. Whether these data are showing clgajette-tc~oigarette                  "

or test-to-test variability, it is clear that single cigarette analyses, even run multiple times, may not provide meaningful information regarding smoke pH. Certainly no Routine" analysis, such as competitive brand monitoring, involved the number of replications reported in (10).

In their 1971 report, Harrell and Musselwhite offered some modifications to the puff-by-puff procedure to improve it. They also suggested that a "technique involving continuous puffing would offer an alternative means of smoke pH measurement, if puff by puff values were not desired" but reported that a great deal of study would be necessary before such an approach could be approved for use. In the following years, however, such a technique was developed and modified (4-7). The "muMpon" method produced a single pH value based on the smoking of 10 to 20 cigarettes cmulttneoudy, and according to one report, "...pH readings from the 20-port smoking machine agree more nearly with the maximum pH readings than the average pH readings obtained with the single port smoldng machine." It appears that the muMport pH method did not replace the puff-by-puff method until the late 1970*6. This approach to pH measurement has also been referred to as the "stirred trap" method.

It appears that no effort was made to reconcile the different values obtained by the different test methods, that is, no correction factors were generated to compare data from one method to another. Interpretation or comparison of smoke pH values Is a difficult enough task when the method generates different types of values, such as with the puff-by-puff method of the late 1960's and early 1970's. Hie reproducibility problems with that method further complicate such comparisons. The meaning, therefore, of comparisons ttspj&thc various test methods fiyjjrJfflS. is questionable at best, and h is inappropriate to draw conclusions from such comparisons.   

fiypptiwej pf figrtUt Smoke pff m t .Quality Factor

A research project was initiated in 1971 to provide information pertinent to studies of *smoke balance control" (11). Several research reports on this project compare RJR cigarette brands to those of competitors in terms of physical and chemical analyses of tobacco, smoke, filters, and cigarette papers. Early in this investigation, smoke pH became a factor of primary interest (12-13). In some reports, sales trends of different cigarette brands were compared and often correlated to other cigarette characteristics. Some of these characteristics were measured, but others were theoretical in nature (14-16).

Woods reported in J 973 that smoke pH appeared to be an important factor to "smoke strength and taste" (14). To test this hypothesis, be analyzed smoke pH data and sales trends for popular filtered cigarettes, and calculated statistically significant positive correlation coefficients between these two variables for 1971 and 1972. Woods theorized that the cigarettes with higher smoke pH were of 'Wgher strength," and therefore more likely to be chosen by smokers.

While a quick look at the graphs presented in the Woods report (Ret 14, Fig. 1-4) could indeed lead one to believe that a strong positive correlation existed between smoke pH and sales trends, a closer culmination reveals that these graphs are misleading and the conclusions Woods drew from them are wrong.

First, the smoke pH values shown are tho same for 1971 and 1972, and are based on averages calculated from data generated over the two years. The number of observations, the range of values in those observations, and the actual observations from which the averages were calculated are not reported. It is also unclear what pH value (average, maximum, or some other value) wis used.

Secondly, the sales trend data are shown as"% change In sales" based on sales of the previous year (1971 relative to 1970,1972 relative to 1971). Use ofthe% change in sales may not provide a fair assessment of actual market shares or trends. For example, in Figure 3 of Reference 14, Woods shows Marlboro 100 as a brand with a *Ugher" smoke pH and among those with the greatest change to tales. WINSTON 85 is shown among the brands with 'lower" smoke pH and a sales change near zero. Aooordmg to the 1971 Maxwell Report (15), which Woods used for his sales trends numbers, Marlboro J00 showed a 23.7% increase in volume relative to 1970. WINSTON 85t on the other hand, showed only a 1.5% volume increase. In actual volume, however, WINSTON 8$ showed 65.42 billion units in 1971 versus 5.07 billion units for Marlboro 100. This translated to a 12.2% share for WINSTON 85, and a 0,9% share fa Marlboro 100, Despite the appearance of the trend line in Figure 4, WINSTON85 was by far a better selling brand in 1971 than Marlboro 100,

These two questions regarding the data and methods used to generate the correlations reported certainly diminish the practical, if not statistical, significance of the correlations. For simplicity, Figures 2 and 4 in Woods* report are the basis for the Mowing discussion. Figures 1 and 3 from the same report show 100 mm brands only, and those data are included within Figures 2 and 4.

A different way to examine the data presented is to divide the brands into market share gainers" and iosers" (above or below the "0" sales trend line), and to further divide the brands into those with 'Wgher** or *1ower" pH (Figure 3). The range of smoke pH values appears to be about 5,88 to 6.50, with a midpoint at about 6.19. (No definition of what constitutes *1ugh" or 'low" pH has been reported; within the relatively narrow range of smoke pH shown in Woods* report, use of the 6.19 as a midpoint is arbitrary.) In this way, the graphs are divided into four quadrants, with 'loscrs/'lower* pH" brands in the bottom left (Quadrant 1), "gainers/lower* pH" brands in the upper left (Quadrant 2), 'feainers/'higher' pH brands in the upper right (Quadrant 3) and iosers/'hlghcr' pH" brands in the lower right (Quadrant A). Figures 2 and 4 (Woods, Re 14) show 29 brands common between them (Figure 2,1972 showed 33 brands k all Figure 4 for 1971 showed 30.) In both graphs, the 29 brands depicted represented 83 to 85% of all U.S. filtered cigarette brands, or about 70% of the US. market at the time.

For 1971,10 brands each are included in Quadrants 1 and 2, and 8 brands are found in Quadrant 3. For 1972,9 brands are to Quadrant 1,11 in Quadrant 2, and 8 in Quadrant 3. In neither year were any brands in Quadrant 4. In 1971 and 1972, one brand, with about 0.5% market share, fell on the midpoint pH hne and was a sales "gainer*1. It was not inoluded in either Quadrant 2 or 3 in this analysis.

By market share, the 'lower" pH quadrants, with sales "gainers" and losers", represented between 45.51 and 77.34% of the TOTAL cigarette market (not Just filtered cigarettes). [The lower end of the share range accounts for the brands actually inoluded in Woods* report. The upper end accounts for those phis any other brands on the market that

were not included in the graph and not included in the 'higher pH*' group. Other ranges reported here were similarly derived]. Quadrant 3, with the "higher" pH brands, represented at least 22.66% of the TOTAL market, but no more than 54.49%. In 1972, there were shifts aoross quadrants, with at least 30.50% of the market consisting of lower*'pH gainers", and at least 13.96% consisting oHowerMpH 'losers", 'lower*'pH brands thus represented at least 44.46% (and up to 75.30%) of the total U.S. cigarette market in 1972, Hie 8 "higher1' pH brands of Quadrant 3 represented at least 24.70% of the total market, but no more than about 55.5%. Therefore, while the graphs of [Woods'] Figures M give the impression that 'liigher" pH brands have higher sales, that is obviously not the case.

With one exception that will be discussed below, all MR brands included to the graphs were in the 'lower*' pH quadrants. These brands represented 97% of RJR's filtered cigarette brands to 1971, and 97.5% of its filtered brands to 1972. (RJR's total market share to those years was about 32.5 to 33% of the US. market,) The exception noted above was VANTAGE 85t which was shown to the original Figure 2 (1972) as a 'liigher*' pH "gainer," However, as VANTAGE vniovfy introduced nationally in April of 1971, sales and pH data shown for 1972 would be from a relatively short time frame. The sales data are also misleading due to the initial national distribution that would have taken place in 1971. Hie data for VANTAGE are therefore distorted and should not have been included to the correlation calculations.

All brands tooluded in Quadrant 3 were made by one of two cigarette manufacturer*. The collective sales growth of these brands continued beyond 1972 to about 1975, when market share for them began to decline, and by 1979, the market share was below that of 1972. The present (1995) market share of this group of brands Is less than two/thirds of its 1972 share. Only two of the eight brands have a market share today greater than their share in 1972, and one of those two has been declining to share since the mid 1980's. The other brand with Increased market share presently accounts for nearly half (47%) of the market share of the entire group (Quadrant 3).

Woods et al also addressed the smoke pH of commercial cigarettes to a second R&DM in 1973 (15). He compiled smoke pH data from various internal sources to track smoke pH over time. Data from 1964 through early 1973 are reported for WINSTON, SALEM, Marlboro, Kent, Viceroy, and Kool (all 85 mm, soft pack styles). Data are also reported for WINSTON, manufiictured from 1955 to 1963, with pH measurements made in 1972 or 1973 on cigarettes that had been freezer-stored, but manufiictured to the year reported. The pH data available for all six cigarettes were "matched" with average 'tar' and nicotine yields measured during the same year, but there is no indication that any of the smoke measurement* was made on the same cigarette sample.

As mentioned to the 'test methods" section above, an additional oonfounder to the data series is that two, and perhaps three, different smoke pH methods were used during the period reported. Woods said 'The pH measured by the pad method [1964 to 1967] is lower than that determined by the standard [electrode] method. However, since no reliable correction factor was available, the values were used as reported" (15). It also appears from the cited laboratory notebook pages that smoke pH data from 1969 to 1973 were measured by the same method used for the freezer stored cigarettes (1955-1963X* W pH method using 10 cigarettes), and by some other method not as easily discerned, the

10pgNbr=701
latter values, however, were those reported for 1969  1973. As a result, the smoke pH dati fa this report (15) appear to he based on three different test methods. It is therefore not surprising that variations in pH over time were seen. (Hie "standard [electrode] method" reported by Woods was also replaced by the 'Wihiport method" a few years after Woods' reports. The 10-oigarette test cited above was a preliminary step toward that method, All smoke pH trends must be viewed with these many method changes in mhd.)

Woods also reported that there was "a very strong positive correlation between smoke pH and sales trends over the years studied" (15). No statistical data supporting this claim are reported by Woods, and sales (in billions of units) and smoke pH are depicted in separate graphs. Two brands that appear to show positive correlations are Marlboro and Kool, which were also among the 'Wgher pH/sales gainer** brands of Woods* earlier report. While each of these two brands showed continued sales growth for several years Mowings Woods' memos, neither the increasing sales nor the 'Irigh" smoke pH trends continued. None of the other brands Included in this second report appeared to show a positive correlation. Sales of all six brands are below 1972 levels today.

Woods continued his analysis of smoke pH and sales trends through 1974 (16). He reported that 'tw]ith only a few exceptions, brands with Ugh smoke pH performed better than those with low Smoke pH," yet presented no statistical data to support the correlation. Nevertheless, he also reported that "Jsjmokc pH data for Marlboro and Kool 85 mm cigarettes indicated that both brands exhibited a significant reduction in smoke pH during 1974." He attributed those reductions "to changes made in the blends, cigarette papers, and manufacturing techniques."

As is the case with research projects that are perceived to identify potential marketplace benefits, the smoke pH studies by Woods et al reoerved attention from R&D Management and were incorporated into 1974 planning efforts. Those plans are outlined in several documents that appear to have been written in late 1973, and include at least one figure from Reference 14. While these documents call for research into and development of higher smoke pH brands at RJR, there is no evidence that such products were ever made or marketed. Other than the Woods memo on 1974 company and competitive products, no R&D reports were found to show that a major smoke pH project continued.

If the smoke pH of RJR brands was increased in an effort to match the 'ligher pHftales gain" brands described by Woods, routine smoke data generated over the years following Woods1 hypothesis would show it. Figures 4 and 5 show smoke pH and sales data for WINSTON 85 and SALEM 85, two of RJR't most popular brands in the early 1970's, Through 1988, the last year for which the data were routinely generated, there was no consistent or sustained increase in smoke pH. likewise, Marlboro 85 and Kool 85, two of the major brands that allegedly fit Woods 'Wgher pH/sales gain" criteria, did not sustain the higher smoke pH of the early 1970's (Figures 6-7). While both brands showed speaks" in pH again fa the late 1970's, these peak vahies were not sustained nor measured again through the 1980's.

Figure 8 shows the smoke pH trends ofMarlboro 85SP and WINSTON85SP from 1977 to 1988, when multiple analyses by the same test method ("mukiport") werepgNbr=702

performed. Hie graph includes the yearly average smoke pH fcr each brand (solid line) and the 'lowest1' and 'lughest" individual measurement recorded over that year. The number of analyses performed varied from year to year, but over the years, the smoke pH of each brand certainly overlapped with that of the other.

While the smoke pH measurement was discontinued as a routine analysis for competitive and Company brands in the late 1980*6, a fairly complete data set exists for a number of brands in the 1977 to 1988 time period (18). These data were generated using only the 'wutoport" pH method. Figures 9  20 show a number of other RJR brands in graphs depicting average smoke pH measurements through this time period. Again, there is no indication that any consistent changes in smoke pH were made. It does appear that smoke pH variations across the brands were fairly consistent, that is, downward trends appear in many brands at the same time. This may be indicative of crop changes that would affect the composition of all brands within a company at about the same time. It may be that brands from other companies would be affected in a similar manner, though not necessarily at the same time, since all use the same pool of domestic tobaooos. Figures 21 and 22 show various brands made by RJft and Philip Morris, respectively, and the average pH of those brands as measured over 1977 to 1988. Gaps to the lines are due to new brand introductions (after 1977) or discontinued analyses based on the brands' market performance. While smoke pH measurements of Philip Morris brands, in general, are higher than those measured for RJR brands, the trends of the lines are similar over time in that the smoke pH of individual brands varies greatly over time, and the average smoke pH of all brands from a company shift up or down over time, perhaps due to crop changes, or due to modifications in the test method or inherent variation of ft. The increase in the number of brands with air dilution would also tend to increase the overall average, as smoke pH values increase with Increasing air dilution (19).

Marlboro 79 Box, the current leading brand style in the U.S. cigarette market, with a 1995 market share of about 7.4%, is the only brand style of Woods' 'higher pHfcales gainer" group that has maintained or increased market share since 1972. Yet, as is obvious from Figure 23, the smoke pH has decreased over the period for which data are available. (Woods shows the brand on two graphs, but does not report actual pH values. It appears to be around 6.40 for his graphs of 1971 and 1972, similar to those values reported for 1977-1979.)

In several of his reports, Woods theorized that the sales gains of brands with higher smoke pH might be because "the relative strength of the nicotine in the smoke increased due to an increase in the amount of free nicotine available" (14). He also observed that "[a]n even better correlation was observed between free nicotine in the smoke and sales** (15). Neither of these statements is supported by actual measurement of "free nicotine" or reporting of the statistical correlation.                                                                     "

Woods reported "calculations" of unbound nicotine based on the smoke pH for                      3

five of the six brands of his second memo (15). However, the data are presented only inpgNbr=703

graphical form, and it is not dear how those calculations were made. In addition, the pH data for Marlboro and Kent, which were not tested in the 1950's and early 1960% were assumed for the calculations to be the same for those years as those of WINSTON. The smoke pH for SALEM wA Kool were each assumed to be 6.0 throughout that period as well. Woods justified his assumptions regarding smoke pH based on total sugar and total nitrogen data, though such data were available only since 1962 for total sugar, and since 1964 or 1969 for total nitrogen. No sugar or nitrogen data were reported tor Kent. It is unclear from the data what levels of total sugar and total nitrogen Woods would have considered significantly diUfiifiQl enough for his pH assumptions not to be valid, but variations across the brands are evident. Nevertheless, the basio assumption of those calculations is that the nicotine would react in smoke the same way as it would in an otherwise "clean" aqueous solution. It is not likely that this assumption would prove to be true. Until recently, there has been no method to measure unbound nicotine in the smoke. Other reports in the literature, however, whfle making assumptions similar to those of Wood (dean aqueous solution at 25C), calculated the percent of unprotonatcd (unbound) nicotine in the TPM of smoke to be very low, about 0.22 to 2.17%, for domestic blend cigarettes with a smoke pH range of 5,2 to 6.2 (20).

Smoke pH data on commercial cigarette brands are somewhat limited in more recent years. However, data are available for some brands on a quarterly basis from early 1995 to early 1996. Average data for all brands tested are shown graphically in Figure 24. Individual analyses by quarter are shown in Figures 25 and 26 for WINSTON[85 and Marlboro 8$, respectively. Differences between the two brands are small and appear to be within the current variation of the method used at RJRT (21). It should also be noted that while the method is similar to the 'tadtrport" method, updates of the laboratory equipment and modifications to the methodological technique have been made over the years.

Smoke pH has been a topic of interest during various times within Research k Development. It is obvious from the number of reports on test methodology during the 1960's and 1970's that it is a measurement for which a consensus was never reached, and for which interpretation and meaning were questioned. Analysis of smoke pH data since the early 1970's has shown that Woods* hypothesis regarding smoke pH and sales trends was inoorreot. Not only did RJR not act on his hypothesis and increase the smoke pH of its brands, but the competitive products ched by Woods to fit his hypothesis did not sustain the high smoke pH values measured at that time. Some of the competitive products declined in sales as smoke pH decreased, while a few others continued to gain market share while their smoke pH was declining. Low 'tar' brands that were just being introduced or were not even on the market at the time of Woods* reports are now among the market share leaders. Changing consumer tastes changed the sales trends of the foil-flavor brands popular in the early 1970's, not the pH of the smoke.
