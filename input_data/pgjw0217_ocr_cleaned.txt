PROCEEDINGS * * *

VIDEOGRAPHER:  My name is Ken Morrison of Veritext.  The date today is October 25th, 2013, and the time is 10:17 a.m.  This deposition is being held in the office of Womble, Carlyle, Sandridge & Rice, One West Fourth Street, Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The caption of this case is John R. Goveia, as Personal Representative of the Estate of Mary F. Goveia, versus R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, et al., in the Circuit Court of the Ninth Judicial Circuit, in and for Orange County, Florida, Civil Division.  The name of the witness is Charles Garner.

At this time the attorneys will identify themselves and the parties they represent after which our court reporter, Cindy Hayden of Veritext, will swear in the witness and we can proceed.

MR. PRYSOCK:  There was someone on the phone who said something?

MR. TEDDER:  Yeah, Greg, this is Gay Tedder.  At the appropriate time I just wanted to ask if we can agree that an objection by one

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=8
Page 9

is an objection for all?

MR. PRYSOCK:  That's fine.  And it may be helpful for those on the phone if you're on --there's a -- there's a microphone attached to the speakerphone taped on there, so we're getting a lot of feedback noise.  It may be helpful to be on mute and then go off when you want to make objections.

MS. TEDDER:  Okay.  But we can agree that an objection by one is an objection for all?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Sure.

MS. TEDDER:  Thank you.  And this is Gay Tedder, Hughes Hubbard & Reed on behalf of Lorillard Tobacco Company.

MR. ALLENDE:  Morning.  This is Pedro Allende of Boies Schiller & Flexner on behalf of Philip Morris USA.

MR. ROSENSTEIN:  Good morning, everyone. It's Mike Rosenstein from Kasowitz, Benson, Torres & Friedman for Defendant Liggett.

MR. KREINER:  This is Chris Kreiner with Womble Carlyle representing R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.  With me is Philip Brown also with my firm.

Q.  Okay.  Sir, you've been listed as a witness in the Goveia case by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to appear at trial.  Are you planning on appearing at trial in this case?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  I  I don't know.  I'm --I'm going through the deposition right now, and whether or not I appear at trial is the decision of the -- the attorneys. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.  I  but I understand that ultimately it would be, but do you have plans to travel to Florida for this trial as we sit here today?

A.  No.

Q.  Did you know that you were listed as a witness in this action?

A.  Well, again, do I have plans to travel to Florida?  I don't have a plane ticket or anything like that or a hotel, but if  if the attorneys want me to come to trial to testify, then I'm --then I'm willing to do that.

Q.  Okay.  When did you first become aware that you were listed as a witness in the Goveia

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=12
Page 13

case?

A.  Probably a couple months ago.  I don't --* I don't have the exact date.

Q.  I know that you've previously been deposed in ~~ when I saw it, it was two cases; one was the Odom case and then there was another case back in 2011, I think.

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Have you been deposed in other cases?

A.  I have not.

Q.  Okay.  What is your current position at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

A.  My -- my current role I'm a senior --senior director in the regulatory oversight group for Reynolds American, Incorporated, Services Company.

Q.  So your actual employer is Reynolds American?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Okay.  How long have you been in that position?

A.  Since early 2011.

Q.  Prior to that time what was your position at R.J. Reynolds or R.J. -~ is it Reynolds American?

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=13
Page 14

A.  No, it was -- prior to that I was with R.J. Reynolds.

Q.  Okay.

A.  And I have always been -- I started with Reynolds in '94.  I have only been in R and D.  My role has changed over time, but when I -- when I left R and D X was in charge of our product stewardship group in -- the department was called product integrity.

Q.  Okay.  R and D stands for research and development; is that correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  What is product stewardship that you've just referred to?

A.  Okay.  What product stewardship is is that we -- we did an evaluation of the products that we manufacture, so all the ingredients that are used in those products, the papers, the tobaccos, as well as that also extends into how we manufacture the products, the types of materials that we use in the manufacturing plants, et cetera.

Q.  For what purpose?

A.  For what purpose?  The purpose is to make sure that as we manufacture products we don't increase the risk of those products.  I think

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=14
Page 15

it's -- it's well-known that smoking comes with sort of a baseline level of risk, and our philosophy has been we don't want to increase that risk by the additives we use or the -- the processes that we use in manufacturing.

Q.  You said products.  Does that include cigarettes such as Camel and other conventional cigarettes?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  So in your role in that capacity you studied the actual ingredients or the makeup of the cigarettes?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  So how do you go about  let's use Camel cigarettes, for example.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Did you study -- in your -- in your role at R and D at that time did you study the ingredients in Camel cigarettes?

A.  Yes, I did.

Q.     How do you  know what's  in  a  Camel cigarette?

A.     How do  I  know what's  in  a Camel  cigarette? Well,   we have  --  we  obviously have  specifications for what goes  in  that cigarette,   what  the blend of

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=15
Page 16

tobacco is, what types of paper -- papers are used in that product as well as what ingredients are used in that product.

Q.  And do those -- you say what goes in the cigarette.  Does that include flavorants and additives?

A.  Yes.  That's -- that's -- that's what I mean when I ~~  when I say the ingredients, flavors and additives.

Q.  Okay.  And where  is that  how do you get those specifications?  Are they in your department?  Is there a list?  X mean, is there ingredients?

A.  In my previous role when I was in product integrity we -- we housed those ingredients in products integrity.  So we obviously had lists of all the ingredients that go into those products.

Q.  Okay.  So, for example -- strike that. Let me ask this:  R.J. Reynolds does not make that publicly available, do they?

A.  I don't think that's true.  I think we --we list the ingredients that we use on our website,

Q.  Okay.  For each cigarette do you list all the ingredients or do you just say flavorants and additives?

A.  Well, there's -- there's kind of two ways that we list it on the website.  Okay.  First of all, you can do sort of a brand-by-brand listing. So if you wanted to find out what was in one style of Camel, you could click on that.  It would give you what I -- what I would call the top-level ingredients, but then there's a number of ingredients that we don't list specifically because obviously that's a proprietary blend that we use to make a Camel taste like a Camel.  But you can also click on all ingredients, and it will give you a list of all the ingredients that are used in all of our products down to the individual chemical level.

Q.  But you'd agree with me, sir, those lists down to the individual chemical level, that's -- I mean, it's over a hundred different chemicals, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And not all those chemicals are used in each cigarette, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  So going back to the example of the Camel cigarettes, that list of what is actually in a Camel cigarette is kept -- the specifications of everything that's in that Camel cigarette is kept

in your prior department in -- in some type of book or something; is that correct?

A.  Yeah, it's -- it's kept in a book and it's kept in a safe, and the access is limited because it is a -- a trade secret  the information is trade secret.

Q.  Okay.  And I understand that.  But you had access to that information, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  So if there --if you wanted to know what exactly was in a Camel  well, strike that.

Do you still have access to that information?

A.  I believe I do, yes.

Q.  Okay.  So as we sit here today, if -- and I'm not going to ask you to even go to do this, but if you wanted to go look and find out exactly what was in a Camel cigarette, all the ingredients in a Camel cigarette, you could go and do that?

A.  Could you restate that question?

Q.  Sure.  You could go right now and look up somewhere --

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.        at R.J.   Reynolds  all  the  ingredients that  are  actually  in  a  Camel  cigarette?

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=18
Page 19

A.  That are in a Camel cigarette today?

Q.  Yes.

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  What about -- you brought that up. So what about prior, you know, brands -- strike that.  Let me start again.

Has the cigarette -- has the ingredient list that is in, again, Camel cigarettes, using that example --

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.   has that changed over the years?

A.  Yes, it has.

Q.  Do you keep or does Reynolds keep a historical list of what was in Camel cigarettes?

A.  I don't think we keep a formal list of sort of changes in Camel over the years, if that's what you're asking.

Q.  Well, do you keep the prior specifications lists?

A.  I would assume that it is somewhere.  Now, I don't know where it is.  But since all of our documents are stored on RJRTdocs.com, I'm sure some of that information would be in there, but we don't have sort of a chronological list of changes to Camel by -- by year.

Q.  Well, the exact ingredients that are in a Camel, for example, you said that's proprietary. So that information would not be on RJRTdocs, would it?

A.  Probably not down to that level.

Q.  Okay.  So, again, that list would be somewhere kept by Reynolds proprietary even though it's a change in the blend over the years?

A.  If -- if we have it, then it would  it would be kept by us, yes.

Q.  Okay.  You say if we have it, who would know at RJR if they have it?

A.  Frankly, I mean, I wouldn't even know where to start with that one as we sit here today. I was -- I would reach out to the people in --in -- in product integrity and see how  how far back their records go, but when you talk about going back to the '60s or something, I don't even know where to start with that.

Q.  Okay.  And you say you don't know where to start with it, because that's not your job to -- to keep -- to warehouse or keep those specifications, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Okay.  If you said this, I apologize.  I

don't remember it.  How long have you been at R.J. Reynolds or any ideation of R.J. Reynolds or Reynolds American?

A.  Okay. t   started with R.J. Reynolds in 1995.  So it's been about a little over 18 years.

Q.  You've been here continuously since then?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And Reynolds American is the parent company of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; is that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  You were listed as a witness, as I said before, including being listed as an expert witness in this case, and I'm going to show you the expert witness disclosure that we received from R.J. Reynolds listing you.

A.  Okay.

Q.  Have you seen this disclosure before?

A.  Yeah.  I think I prepared it.

Q.  Okay.  Did you prepare it by yourself or working with attorneys for Reynolds?

-A.  I prepared it working with attorneys.

Q.  Okay.  I'm not going to read the entire thing, but there are  it references in here several times or multiple times you will discuss

subjects on -- dealing with American Tobacco Company and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation; is that fair?

A.  That's fair.

Q.  Okay.  Have you ever worked for American Tobacco Company?

A.  I have not.

Q.  Have you ever worked for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation?

A.  X have not.

Q.  How did you become knowledgeable or an expert on subjects involving American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson?

A.  By reading documents from those two companies.

Q.  By reading documents from where?

A.  From RJRTdocs.com, from, you know, documents going back for both companies sort of back -- back in history looking at some of the programs that they ran, their efforts in R and D, et cetera.

Q.  And RJRTdoos.com is a publicly available website, correct?                                      -, <^  & . ^

A.  Correct.

Q.     When did you  first undertake  to  --   to  read

these documents?

A.  Probably started a couple years ago, maybe -- maybe a little more.

Q.  Why did you decide to undertake this? A.  I was -- I was --

MR. KREINER:  Let me just interpose  I object to the extent it calls for attorney-client communications, but to the extent you can answer the question without revealing those communications, Doctor, please do so.

THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I was asked either by the attorneys from our company or other folks that I can't remember at this particular time. They explained the situation with the lawsuits and with specific reference to the lawsuits in Florida.  They said you're head of product stewardship, you understand this.  Would it be something that you would have an interest in doing?  It's voluntary, by the way.  This is not my job.  Thought about it for some time, for quite some time, and X decided, yes, it's something that I would be willing to do. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Now, when you say it's voluntary, you mean

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430

CDpgNbr=23

they didn't force you to do it, correct? A.  That's correct.

Q. But voluntary sometimes connotes that the person is not being paid anything to do something. You're being paid your normal salary for your time here today, correct?

A.  I'm being paid my normal salary. **"Q.  Yes.

A.  But I'm not paid extra for doing this. Q  Okay.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Counsel, just so I'm clear, I know you asserted an objection.  He's been listed as an expert witness.  Are you asserting that conversations in preparing him as an expert witness are -- are -- are attorney-client privilege or work product?

MR. KREINER:  I'm asserting that he's an employee of Reynolds American, Inc.  He's a former employee of R.J. Reynolds, and to the extent he has had conversations with lawyers, those would be attorney-client communications, and I will assert an objection and instruct him not to answer as appropriate.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay, but you understand my -- my problem here.  He's listed as an

212-279-9424

212-490-3430pgNbr=24
Page 25

expert witness.

MR. KREINER:  I don't believe that waives my right to assert an attorney-client privilege and instruct him not to answer is my position. MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  Well, just so we're clear, our position is going to be, so it's not a surprise later, if  if he's not allowed to answer those questions, we're going to move to strike him as an expert witness because that is something that we can obviously explore, his preparation as an expert. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  You mentioned that you -- well, strike that.

Okay.  So we started talking about your becoming knowledgeable on issues regarding B&W and American Tobacco, and I'm grouping them together. Was it a separate review of documents by you or did you do both at the same time?

A.  It was probably both.  I mean, there --there were times when I wanted to have an understanding, say, of the history of American Tobacco Company, so I would focus on documents from American Tobacco sort of through the years.  There were other times when I would focus on, say, a

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=25
Page 26

specific subject, and I would look at what was Brown &  Williamson doing at the time and what was American doing at the time.  So I guess probably a little bit of both.

Q.     Okay.  But just so I'm clear, as I go forward with this questioning, it wasn't some type of separate project where you did one thing regarding Brown & Williamson and you did another thing regarding American Tobacco, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q. So when I ask questions about the things you do, I can -- I can group them together and it was the same things?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Okay.  How did you come up with the --well, I've been on RJRT.doos, and -- and there are search terms that you can use to come up with things, correct?

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Yes?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.

A.  Sorry.

Q. That's all right. And there are also --you can also put in document ID numbers, correct?

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=26
Page 27

A.  Correct.

Q.  Did you have document ID numbers that were given to you that you were able to punch in and pull up the documents?

A.  No, I think I -- I think pretty much all the time I used search terms.

Q.  Okay.  When you say pretty much all the time that makes me think that maybe there were times where you were given document numbers, so I need to clarify.

A.  Well, let me -- okay.  Then let me be clear.  I don't recall any times when I've used document numbers, but since I can't be 100 percent sure, I'm saying I don't have any type of recollection of putting in doc numbers, usually using search terms.

Q.  Okay.  That's fair.  Where did you come up with the search terms?

A.  Well, I think sort of based on what I was  my -- my training and what I did in product stewardship, I would say -- you know, let me just choose one for -- for example  what did Brown & Williamson do with respect to the reduction of tar or what did Brown & Williamson's reconstituted tobacco sheet look like?  So those types of terms.

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=27
Page 28

And this is -- you know, again stemmed from the experience that I had at R.J. Reynolds as a head of product stewardship group.

Q.  Were you given search terms or given topics by anyone?

A.  No.

Q.  How did you know what to start researching then?

A.  Well, I think, you know, again, based on the type of work that I was doing at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, and then, you know, I -- I sort of have a history of what happened at R.J. Reynolds over the years and the steps that they have taken as their products were modified, and I just sort of took that and sort of applied that to Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco.

Q.  Okay.  I was asking you about the expert disclosure in this case, and you said that you wrote it in conjunction with -- with your attorneys?

A.  That's correct.                                        . -.*.-?.

Q.  Okay.  Is this expert disclosure accurate then?

A.  Yes.

Q.  How many Brown & Williamson and American

Page 29

Tobacco documents would you estimate that you have reviewed in -- in becoming prepared to discuss these topics that are outlined in your expert disclosure?

A.  Well, I obviously can't give you an exact number.  Probably, I don't know, a hundred or so.

Q.  Okay.  And you said this started a couple years ago?

A.  Probably, yeah.  Maybe -- maybe even a little bit more.

Q.  Okay.  And how much time would you estimate that you've spent total in researching

documents for -- of Brown & Williamson and American

A.  You know, again^lva1f?*r*%^^ estimate.  And it all depends on what is going on at work at that particular time.  If it's a -~ if it's a very busy week, I may look at none.  If I have a few hours extra, then X will read some.

Q.  Fair to say that you did this on company :time or^in the course of ypur job?

A.  No, I don't think that's fair.  I think it's probably a combination of when I had time during my day job I would review documents; many times I would review documents -- I would take them

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424                                   www.vefttextxom                                  212-490-3430pgNbr=29

home or stay late and read them at night.

Q.  So let me go back to the question.  How much time would you estimate that you've spent reviewing or researching Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco documents?

A.  I don't even know that I can give you an accurate estimate.  Let's say 1 spent two years reading documents.  Figure on average maybe let's just say five hours per month, so 60 hours per year, so 120 hours per two years, probably somewhere between that and 200 hours per year I guess, but again, let's be clear that is -- that is an estimate.

Q.  Okay.  And you may have misspoken.  I thought I heard you say 200 hours a year.  You mean total time?

A.  Total, yes.

Q.  Okay.  Did you do anything else other than review documents on RJRTdocs.com to prepare you to discuss your testimony regarding Brown 6 Williamson and American Tobacco?

A.  I -- I may have talked to people that worked at Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco to get their input as to if I saw something in a document that wasn't clear, X might ask them for

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424                                   www.veritext.com                                  212-490-3430pgNbr=30

some clarification.

Q.  All right.  And one of those people you talked to was Chris Cook, correct?

A.  Chris Cook, yes.

Q.  And I think I've read Dr. Cook -- strike that.

X think I've seen that you indicated that you spoke with Dr. Cook approximately ten times for five minutes or less; is that accurate?

A.  That's probably accurate.

Q.  Okay.  Anyone else that you've spoken to besides Dr. Cook?

A.  I probably spoke to Jim Figlar and Aaron Williams.  They were former employees from Brown & Williamson tobacco.

Q.  What did you talk with Dr. Figlar about?

A.  I don't recall as I sit here, but if there was --if there was something in a Brown & Williamson document that I wanted some clarification I would ask him to explain that to me.

Q.  Okay.  And how many times did you talk to Dr. Figlar?

A.  I don't know.

Q.     Okay.     Less  than  five?

A.  I'm sure.

Q.  Okay.  How about -- the other person, I don't know the other person.  Who is that?

A.  His name is Aaron Williams.

Q.  Okay.

A.  Probably about the same amount of time.

Q.  Is it Dr. Williams?

A.  Dr. Williams, yeah.

Q.  What -- what's his title?

A.  Currently he is I think vice president of smokeless product development for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco.

Q.  Okay.  Same question regarding Dr. Aronson (sic), how many times did you speak with him?

A.  Probably about the same as Dr. Figlar and Dr. Cook.

Q.  Five or less?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And what were the topics that you spoke with Dr. Aronson -- Aronson about?

A.  Dr. Williams.

Q.  Dr. Williams?

A.  You know, again I'm  I'm not sure.  If I found something in a Brown & Williamson document that I wanted some clarity on I would ask them to

explain that.

Q.  Anybody else? A.  That's probably about it. Q.  Okay.  Let me ask you if -- we've established that you never worked for Brown & Williamson or American Tobacco, correct? A.  Correct.

Q.  But these gentlemen did, Dr. Cook, Dr. Williams and Dr. Figlar, correct? A.  Correct.

Q.  Why -- since they worked there, why wouldn't they be the people or the person to be disclosed as an expert on Brown & Williamson ajflgt^^ American Tobacco?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form, lack of foundation, and to the extent Dr. Garner has information only gleaned from conversations with attorneys representing the company, I instruct him not to answer on the basis of attorney-client privilege.  Subject to that instruction, Doctor, if you can answer.

THE WITNESS:  I  I can't answer that.  I don't know why they -- whether or not --BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Dr. Cook started at America Tobacco in

1988 and went over to Brown & Williamson in 1994; is that correct?

A.  X know he went to Brown & Williamson in '94.  I don't know when he started at American Tobacco, but he did work for American Tobacco before joining Brown & Williamson.

Q.  Okay.  Does it sound accurate though that he started in 1988 or you just don't know?

A.  It sounds accurate but I -- you know, again, 1 don't know.

Q.  All right.  I'll  I'll represent to you that in his disclosure, his CV, he has stated that he,started in 1988 at -- at American Tobacco.  So with that understanding or my representation, how would Dr. Cook know anything about what happened at American Tobacco or Brown & Williamson prior to 1988 other than just doing what you did, reading documents?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  You know, again, I don't know.  I mean, he certainly would have read some documents.  He certainly was working with people at the time that were there prior to 1988.

Q.  Did you have discussions with him in your -- in your -- strike that.

In your discussions with him in preparation for ~- for being the one to testify as to American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson, did you ask him about his conversations he had with people who had worked there prior to 1988?

A.  I don't believe so.  I think I -- most of my conversations with him were based on things --projects that he had worked on.

Q.  Okay.  And as far as Dr. Williams or Dr. Figlar, do you know when they started at Brown & Williamson?

A.  I do not.

Q.  Do you know how they would have any knowledge as to Brown & Williamson or American Tobacco prior to starting work there whenever they did?

A.  I would suspect the same way that Dr. Cook did, either read documents that were produced prior -- prior to them starting with the company or having conversations with people that had worked there during that period of time.

Q.  And these are all documents that are publicly available?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Have we covered everything that you have done to become familiar with these areas that you've listed in your expert disclosure regarding Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco?

A.  Yes, I believe so.

Q.  Are you currently scheduled to testify in any other trials that you know of?

A.  I know I'm -- I'm listed on a number of trials.  I guess X don't understand what you mean by scheduled to testify.  I mean, I  you know, again, I don't think the trial date has been set, and I don't have a plane ticket to go to the State of Florida, but I know I'm -- I'm listed in a number of cases.

Q.  Fair enough.  Do you  to your knowledge, do you have any other depositions scheduled as we sit here today?

A.  Through the end of the year I do not. That's as far out as I can go.

Q.  In reviewing this expert witness disclosure, I may have missed it, but it appears to me that you were going to talk about research and testing from a historical perspective regarding American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson, but I did

not see in here that you were going to discuss those same topics with regard to R.J. Reynolds.  Is that accurate?

A.  I would have to review this.  If that's the way you read it -- let me just take a quick look at it, if you don't mind.

Q.  Absolutely.  Take your time. A.  Okay.  Can you restate the question, please?

Q.  How about if we have the court reporter read it back.

(The following question was read back: Q:  In reviewing this expert witness disclosure, I may have missed it, but it appears to me that you were going to talk about research and testing from a historical perspective regarding American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson, but I did not see in here that you were going to discuss those same topics with regard to R.J.

BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  Well, are you intending to talk about R.J Reynolds1 historical research programs/ including research and testing related to understanding and reducing the inherent risks of smoking?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And how did you go about becoming knowledgeable in those areas?

A.  Well, again, I've -- I've worked for the company for about 18 years, so I have some firsthand experience, and then I -- I also have looked back a bit at some of the -- the Reynolds' documents as well.

Q.  Okay.  So you've also gone on to RJRTdocs.com and researched Reynolds' documents?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Is that Included in the estimate of time that you gave me?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  All right.  So that's not something that you did separately; that was part of what you were doing in looking at American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson?

A.  Correct.

gave me, a hundred or so I think you said, that would include R.J. Reynolds documents as well as Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco?

A.  Yeah, it would probably be a little bit greater than that.

Q.  It would be more documents?

A.  I think so.

Q.  So how many documents do you now think you reviewed?

A.  Somewhere between a hundred and 200 I think would be a reasonable estimate.

Q.  Did you print out these documents?

A.  Yeah.  Some of them.  Some of them I just read on the -- on the computer.

Q.  And do you still have these?

A.  I probably have some of them.  I don't know if I have all of them.

Q.  Do you-have a list of documents?

A.  I have a reliance list, if that's what you're asking.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Great.

MR. KREINER:  We gave it -- I'm not sure if we produced it.  If we're required to we would have, but he has a copy here. MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

MR. KREINER:  I don't know if it was included in the disclosures or not.

MR. PRYSOCK:  It -- it was not, so that would be great if I could see it.  And I don't believe it was given to us prior. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.      If you brought all that stuff for me, it may just be easier to hand it over and let me see it all.

A,  This?

MR. KREINER:  Yeah, sure. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I see in here it says Plaintiff John Goveia's Verified Answers to Interrogatories.  Did you review those?

A.  Yes, I did.

Q.     What was  your purpose   in  reviewing  those? A.      Just  to  understand  the   --   the  background of   the  case.

Q.  Okay.  Who prepared this reliance list of 1002 documents?

A.  I prepared it.  Actually I  I told attorneys what  what documents I wanted on that list, and I -- I didn't type it, if that's what you're asking.  But I told them these -- these were the documents that I have reviewed.

Q.  Were you given a list and you picked out things?

A.  No.

Q.  So you -- you compiled this list all on your own?

A.  Well, again, what does it mean by I compiled it?  I did not type the list.  But I  but I told the attorneys which -- which documents I would like to have on the reliance list.

Q.  Okay.  I understand that you may have not physically created this exact document, and that's  that's a good point, but how did you  how did you give them the information if you didn't give them a list?

A.  Well, I had documents, right, that I read, and I would say I would like this one on the list, I would like this one on the list, I would like this one on the list.

Q.     The question was  any phone conversations with any  attorneys   representing R.J.   Reynolds.

A.     Then  I probably had two phone conversations  saying can you come over here at this time.

Q.     Okay.     What  about for your prior

deposition?

A.  What's the question?

Q.     What -~ what preparation -- or how many times did you meet with the attorneys before your prior deposition?

A.  For my last deposition roughly about the same.  1 met for a couple hours prior to the deposition, and the first one I -- I don't remember.

Q.  Okay.  Going back to the meeting on Tuesday, since that was the most recent one in preparation for this case, you said it was about two hours?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  What did you discuss at that meeting?

MR. KREINER:  I instruct Dr. Garner not to answer on the basis of attorney-client privilege.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  Counsel, I put my position on the record regarding a disclosed expert witness and this information which we should be entitled to ask.

MR. KREXNER:  And I think I've made my position clear.  We'll respond to any motion you file.  He's also testifying as a fact

witness.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Sir, in your -- in your conversations on Tuesday, did you discuss types of questions that would be asked in this deposition?

MR. KREINER:  X object and instruct Dr. Garner not to answer on the grounds of attorney-client privilege. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Sir, did you discuss any -- did you do --strike that.

Have you ever participated in a mock cross-examination where questions are asked of you that a plaintiff's attorney might ask?

MR. KREINER:  I object and instruct him not to answer on the basis of attorney-client privilege to the extent anything happened, but if there's other instances I guess you can answer, but to the extent there have been conversations, I instruct --with lawyers representing the company, I instruct him not to answer on the basis of attorney-client privilege.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, the question was has

he ever participated in a mock cross-examination where an attorney acts like the plaintiff's attorney and asks you questions.

MR. KREINER:  Since you're specifically asking about conversations with attorney, to the extent he's had conversations with attorneys representing R.J. Reynolds that may have touched on those issues, I instruct him not to answer.  If there are other attorneys that he's had that ~- that didn't represent the company 1 guess he can answer.

THE! WITNESS:  I'm not sure I understand, but --

MR. KREINER:  Well, let me be clear.  To the -- I'm instructing you not to answer the question on the basis of attorney-client privilege the way the question has been asked.

THE WITNESS:  Okay.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  So, sir, I'll try to ask it one more time just to make sure it's clear on the record when we take this to the court. A.  Okay. Q.  What I'm asking you is in your preparation

as an expert witness here today --A.  Uh-huh.

Q*  -- "3.f you have participated in any type of mock cross-examination where an attorney for R.J. Reynolds acted like a plaintiff's attorney asking questions of you that may be asked in this deposition?

MR. KREINER:  And as that question is framed and in the context of Dr. Garner also being a fact witness, I instruct him not to answer on the basis of attorney-client privilege.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  We will be moving to strike him as an expert witness. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Have you ever reviewed any transcripts of other employees of R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson or American Tobacco?  When I mean transcripts I mean of depositions or trial transcripts.

A.  Just my own.

Q.     Okay.     And  that was  after  the Odom case? A.     Yeah.

Q.     Did you  review  that  recently or  at  the time   or both?

A.  Well, as I recall, after -- after the deposition is taken then I get a -- call it a rough draft for me to do a review and make sure that the information was captured in an accurate manner, so in both of my depositions I went through that process.

Q. Okay. Did you rereview it to get, you know, it fresh in your mind for this deposition today?

A.  I did not.

Q.  Okay.  And just to clarify, so you've never reviewed a deposition or a trial transcript of questions asked of Dr. Cook, Dr. Figlar or anybody else at R.J. Reynolds?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Okay.  Dr. Garner, what is R.J. Reynolds' current position on nicotine as far as its effect on its customers?

A.  I think our  I think our * our views are on our website.  I can't -- I don't know if I can recite it 100 percent accurately, but it basically says nicotine in tobacco products are addictive.

Q.  Okay.  As a scientist, sir, what is your definition of addictive?

Page 49

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  You can answer, sir.

MR. KREINER:  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  Okay.  Well, I think the ~~ the general definition of addiction is  very  very simply is something that is -- is difficult to quit.  Based on that current definition I think tobacco products and nicotine fall in that category. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Would you agree that the cigarettes manufactured by R.J. Reynolds that contain nicotine can be difficult for customers to quit? A.  Yes, I would agree with that. Q.  Would you agree that cigarettes containing nicotine that are made by R.J. Reynolds can be extremely difficult for some people to quit?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  Well, again, I don't know what you mean by extremely difficult.  But for  for some people it can be difficult; for other people it can be more difficult. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  So if you said before that it can be extremely difficult for some people to quit, are you now recanting that testimony?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  No.  I'm just saying it's --I think it's  it's  it's known and it's been known for a number of years that smoking is difficult to quit, and for some people it can be very difficult or extremely difficult. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  How long has it been R.J. Reynolds' public position that it can be extremely difficult for some people to quit?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  And, again, I'd have to go and look at the exact language on the website. I don't know if it says that it can be extremely difficult.  I just -- it says nicotine in tobacco products is addictive, and as I sit here, I don't remember what the exact language is with respect to quitting. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I understand that.  But my question was how long has it been R.J. Reynolds' public position

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=50

that cigarettes containing nicotine can be extremely difficult for some people to quit? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. Assumes facts not in evidence.

THE WITNESS:  Well, you know, again, I  1 think our views were stated on our website probably early 2000 time frame. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.  How about Brown & Williamson? A.  I believe Brown & Williamson, they -- they were roughly the same time frame as R.J. Reynolds. This is obviously prior to the two companies merging.  I think Brown & Williamson had a view on nicotine probably about the same time frame, maybe -- maybe a little bit earlier.

Q.  And Brown & Williamson and R.J. Reynolds merged in 2004; is that right? A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  And at that time R.J. Reynolds assumed all the liabilities and assets of Brown & Williamson; is that correct?

A.  That's a legal question. Q.  Fair enough.  I didn't mean it to be. R.J. Reynolds took over Brown & Williamson in 2004, correct?

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=51
Page 52

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  And you don't know whether this --in purchasing Brown & Williamson if R.J. Reynolds assumed all the liabilities and assets of Brown & Williamson?

A.  I'm assuming we did.

Q.  Okay.  And R.J. Reynolds continued --after 2004 continued to make the cigarettes ~- the brand of cigarettes that were formerly made by Brown & Williamson, correct?

A.  I believe we -- we -~ we made some of them.  I'm not sure if we made all the brand styles after the two companies merged.  But, for example, Kool, that was a Brown & Williamson brand and we --we make Kool today.

Q.  Correct.  So  and my question is to this day R.J. Reynolds continues to manufacture and sell brands that were formerly manufactured and sold by Brown &  Williamson?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And R.J. Reynolds makes money on those brands, the ones that they sell today, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Okay.  Getting back to -- what is your understanding of when R.J. Reynolds took over

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=52
Page 53

American Tobacco brands?

A.  Well, I think -- when Brown & Williamson bought American Tobacco in I think it was 1994, they inherited some of their brands, and then when R.J. Reynolds and Brown 6 Williamson tobacco merged in 2004, we inherited those brands.  So the American brands went first to Brown & Williamson and then to R.J. Reynolds.

Q.  And as we sit here today, R.J. Reynolds continues to manufacture some brands which were formerly prior to 1994 made and sold by American Tobacco, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And RJR makes a profit on cigarettes that it sells that were  today that were formerly manufactured by American Tobacco?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  By the way, Doctor, I know you've been through this once before, but if you want to take a break at any time, just let me know, if you need to use the rest room or anything.

I was asking you -- before X got a little sidetracked I was asking you about the positions of the companies on the nicotine in cigarettes and whether it's addictive.  Do you recall those

questions?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  In reviewing the documents that you did of Brown & Williamson, American Tobacco and R.J. Reynolds, did you come across research that had been done by the companies regarding nicotine in cigarettes and its addictive qualities?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.  Go ahead.  To be clear, Doctor, every time I object to the form you can nonetheless answer the question --

THE WITNESS:  Okay.

MR. KREINER:   unless I instruct you otherwise.

THE WITNESS:  I don't recall if there were specific documents related to the addictiveness of nicotine that I reviewed.  There were --there were a couple documents that I reviewed going back to like 1940.  I don't recall if this was in an American Tobacco document.  It was a peer-reviewed article where it talks about the role of nicotine in the tobacco habit.  I believe I saw sort of one  one study that was done by American Tobacco where they gave people cigarettes with differing

levels of nicotine and asked them to rate which ones they -~ they preferred.  Those are about the only two examples I can come up with off the top of my head. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Well, let me ask you this then:  You would agree with me, sir, that the nicotine that's contained in cigarettes and the potential for addiction is one of the inherent risks of smoking, correct?

MR. KREXNER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Can you -- can you ask that question again, please? BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Sure.  Smoking cigarettes -- strike that. Becoming addicted is one of the potential inherent risks of smoking cigarettes containing nicotine; would you agree with that?

MR. KREXNER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  X don't think I would  I ..don't think I would -- would -- would agree in the manner that it was stated. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  All right. A.  I mean, the -- the risk that is associated

with smoking is not -~ most scientists do not think it's related to nicotine.  They think it's related to other -- other chemicals that are in the cigarette smoke.. Nicotine -~ nicotine by itself is not thought to play a role in the risk of smoking.

Q.  But you would agree with me, sir, that one of the risks of smoking is becoming addicted, right?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I would go back to my previous answer.  I mean, X think the risk of smoking has to do with the chemicals that are present that are thought to be responsible for causing smoking-related disease, and the -~ the nicotine is not thought to play a role in that. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I'm not talking about the actual mechanism of disease, carcinogens, for example.  What I'm talking about is inherent risks of smoking; is it RJR's position that one of the risks of smoking is becoming addicted?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, first of all, I mean, I can't  I can't answer from RJR's position because I'm not sure if we actually have a

position on that.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Is it your position?

A.  Is it -~ my position is that the risk of smoking is related to other chemicals that may be responsible for causing the disease.  The ~- the nicotine and the addictiveness is a  the addictive nature of smoking is sort of a classification of the behavior.  Now, nicotine is -- is -- nicotine plays a role in that certainly,   but I don't ~- I don't see how you can link the classification of a behavior to the risk of the product because that's -- those two aren't related.

Q.  If a person is thinking about taking up smoking --

A,  Uh-huh.

Q.  -- is there a risk that they will become addicted to smoking cigarettes?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. MR. PRYSOCK:  Strike that.  Let me ask again.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  If a person is thinking about starting to smoke cigarettes, is one of the risks that they

undertake in making that decision that they will become addicted?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I'm -~ I'm not sure exactly what -- what you're trying to ask me on this. I'm 

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I'm just trying to ask you if you think that a person picking up cigarettes has a risk of becoming addicted?

MR. KREINER:  I'll object to the form again.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  I mean, I think any  anyone that starts to smoke could -- could they become -- could they become addicted to smoking?  Based on the definition that we use today, yes, but that  you know, again that's a classification of behavior.  When you say risk, I mean, I think more of the inherent risk of smoking a tobacco product from a -- from a toxicology perspective.  So I guess I'm having trouble linking those two concepts. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  As a scientist, as someone who has been at RJR in the research and development department and

now is in the product stewardship department you can't make the link between someone becoming addicted to cigarettes continuing to smoke and possibly suffering disease?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, you know, again, whether -- whether somebody smokes that -- that is not necessarily related to the endpoint, which is, you know, the development of a smoking-related illness.  I think, you know, again, the -- the -- whether they -- whether they become addicted, that's a classification of the behavior, and, you know, if.-- if they're addicted, they still can quit.  It's just a classification of the behavior. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I understand that. A.  Okay.

Q.  I'm asking a simpler question. A.  Okay.

Q.  Do you believe that a person who chooses to begin smoking runs the risk of becoming addicted to those cigarettes containing nicotine?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  It's been asked and answered several times.  It's

becoming argumentative, but go ahead, Doctor.

THE WITNESS:  Well, you know, again, if somebody chooses to start smoking could they become -- could they become addicted to smoking?  Yes.  But I don't -* I just struggle with -- as I've explained several times before, I struggle with the risk because that has nothing to do with the development of a smoking-related disease.  That's where I think the risk really falls.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  So just becoming hooked on cigarettes is not a risk to you?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  Well, again, based on my understanding of risk as a toxicologist, the risk is not  has nothing to do with whether somebody smokes or whether they find it difficult to quit.  The risk ties to the  the development of a smoking -- smoking related disease.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  All right.  I'll tell you what.  We'll try it without -- without the word risk because you

keep going back to that. A.  Okay.

Q.  If a 21-year-old came up to you and said, I'm thinking about starting smoking --A.  Oh-huh,

Q.  -- what are the dangers, would you include in that that you run the danger of becoming addicted to these cigarettes?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  That would not be my first response.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I didn't ask you that, sir. A.  My --^^:     MR. KREINER:  No.  No.  Let him  let him --

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I asked you if that would be --

MR. KREINER:  -- answer or withdraw the question.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I didn't -- I didn't ask you if that would -- to rate them, sir.  I just asked you would that be one of the things that you would tell them is a risk or a danger, becoming addicted?

MR. KREINER:  And I object to the instruction, Doctor.  You're certainly entitled to explain your answer.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  What I would say  if a 21-year-old came up to me and said I'm thinking of starting smoking, I would say, you understand smoking will increase your risk for a number of diseases?  I probably wouldn't go to you run the risk of becoming addicted unless they asked me my views on smoking and --smoking and addictiveness, because I think -~ you know, again, maybe it's just my -~ my background and my training as a toxicologist, but when I say risk, I think of risk of -- of a particular smoking-related disease. 000tmz:BY MR. PRYJSOCK:

Q.  So the answer is, no, you wouldn't tell a 21-year-old who asked you about the potential dangers of smoking that it would possibly be addictive?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I didn't say I wouldn't tell them.  I just said it wouldn't be the first place I'd start.  I would go into the risk of -- of smoking as far as a disease endpoint

before I went into the -- the classification of their behavior and -- but, you know, again, I think most people, if not everybody today, understands smoking is difficult to quit, and whether you want to call it it's addictive or it's highly addictive, it's a classification of the behavior.

BY MR. 3PRYS0CK: Q.  Sir, I'm just a little confused.  So would you tell the 21-year-old who's thinking about smoking that one of the dangers is you can become addicted or not?  It's just a yes or no.

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

THE WITNESS:  You know, to be honest, I mean, I  I really hadn't thought about it.  I would certainly tell them about the -- the risks of smoking.  Would I tell them that smoking cigarettes is very difficult to quit? Maybe.  But, you know, again, I don't think --I probably wouldn't even think of that because everybody knows that.  It's -- it's not -- I don't think any 21-year-old is going to come and not understand that smoking is difficult to quit.

Q.  Okay.

MR. KREINER:  If you're about to move to docs, can we take a break?  It's been about an hour.

MR. PRYSOCK:  During the break Madam Court Reporter brought up the fact that the witness had inadvertently not been sworn in in the beginning with the introduction of all the counsel and the videographer, so what we've agreed to do is she is going to swear the witness in now, and this will be retroactive to the start of the deposition and everyone agrees that the testimony he gave is under oath -- the testimony he has given thus far is under oath and will continue to be once he's sworn in; is that fair?

with that.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  And, Doctor, now that you've heard that, let me just ask you everything -- the testimony that you've given up to this point prior to just being sworn in, was it all truthful? A.  Yes, it was. Q.  Okay.

MR. PRYSOCK:  And, Counsel, 1 think just for technical reasons whoever is on the phone I need to get you guys to agree too that -- that the oath will be retroactive to the start of this deposition.

MR. ALLENDE:  Greg, this is Pedro Allende for Philip Morris USA.  That's fine by me.

MS. TEDDER:  This is Gay Tedder for Lorillard; we agree.

remember now with all that. BY MR. 2RYSOCK:

Q.  Dr. Garner, right before we took a break we were talking about the potential addictiveness of cigarettes, and I'm not going to rehash that, but you did say -- you made a comment -~ and I'm paraphrasing, sir, and correct me if wrong --something to the effect of people have known for a long time that it can be difficult to quit cigarettes; is that fair?

A.  I think that's fair, yes.

Q.  So you believe that -- when you say a long time, how long do you believe that it's been common knowledge that people can have a very difficult time quitting cigarettes?

A.  Well, you know, again, I'm -- I have haven't studied the history of this, but just some of the documents that I've read.  I think I cited one earlier.  It was a study that was published in 1940, and it was entitled The Role of Nicotine in the Tobacco Habit.

Q.  Okay,  So it goes back decades?

A.  So -- decades.

Q.     At  least,   in your  opinion?

A.     Easy  --  easy decades.

Q.  Okay.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 16, Document titled Young Adult Smoker Lifestyles and Attitudes, was marked for identification.) BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Doctor, I'm going to show you a document that we will mark as Plaintiff's MM 16.  And I'll give you whatever length of time you want to look over it, sir.  I'll represent to you that this is a 1947 document from Brown & Williamson. A.  Okay.

Q.  So my first question to you, sir, is in your research of a hundred to 200 documents in preparation for your testimony did you -- did you see this document?

A.  I don't recall having seen this. Q.  Okay.  Let me refer you, sir, if I can to --

MR. KREINER:  Do you want him to read it first or --

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  You know, it's up to you.  You can read the whole thing if you want.  I've got all day.  I was going to refer you to Page 4.  Under the heading research results --

MR. KREINER:  I don't have a research results on Page 4.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  It's probably easier to do the Bates stamp.

A.  Okay.

Q.  If you look at the bottom, the Bates stamp is 0990.  It may be the second Page 4. A.  Ahh, it is.

Q.  And, Doctor, let me refer you down under research results, the second to the bottom of the paragraph that starts with adults a different situation exists, that last sentence, sir, says, nearly all regular smokers are nicotine dependent.

This is a Brown & Williamson document from 1974.  Do you agree with the statement that nearly all regular smokers are nicotine dependent? MR. KREINER:  I just object to your assertion as to what this document is.  But subject to that, go ahead, Doctor.

THE WITNESS:  Well, it's  it's difficult for me to comment on that because I don't know what their definition was of nicotine --nicotine dependent.  You said this was a 1974 -- okay.  You know, at that time it was

smoking was still classified as a habit by the Surgeon General.  That definition didn't change until 1988.  So, again, you know, without  without having an understanding of what the author of: this document meant by nicotine dependent, I don't know if I can really say much about this.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  The question, sir, is:  Do you agree that nearly all regular smokers are nicotine dependent? MR. KREINER:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I  I'm not an expert on nicotine.  I'm a toxicologist by training.  I have a little bit of experience in the area, but I don't think ~~ I don't think I can actually comment on whether or not that's true or whether I even believe that's true without having -- having an understanding of what that actually means.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  And just to be clear, sir, you were disclosed as an expert because you had prepared by researching Brown & Williamson, American Tobacco and R.J. Reynolds documents on the inherent risks of smoking, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And you can't tell me one way or another whether you believe that nearly all regular smokers are nicotine dependent?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, certainly there is  there is a number of regular smokers that are nicotine  nicotine dependent, but I don't know whether it's all or -- or a subset.  I mean, I -- I mean, I will state that there obviously are some people that smoke, and the reason they smoke is related to the presence of nicotine in tobacco products, but as far as being able to quantitate that to nearly ad1, X just can't do that. -t^^^^^^^^^^--' BY MR. PRYSOCK:    ^^^^^^^f - ^ Q.  Well, nearly all means most in my mind. Does nearly all mean most in your mind?  It means more than half, right? A.  Yeah. Q.  Okay.

A.  Many -- many people the reason they smoke  why people smoke is a very complicated phenomenon.  To some people the nicotine can be important.  To others -- to others it's not that

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424                                   www.veritext.com                                  212-490-3430pgNbr=70

important.  But X think since nicotine also plays a sensory role in tobacco products I think a key reason that people smoke is for nicotine, but whether I can state that they are nicotine --nicotine dependent or not or most or all are I think that's a little bit outside of the scope. Q.  Would you agree with me that more than half of regular smokers are nicotine dependent? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I  I just don't  I  I have never seen any  any data or any information on how to quantitate that. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Sir, if I could refer you to the very front page of MM 16. A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Under key findings -- and by the way, the title of this document is Young Adult Smoker Lifestyles and Attitudes. A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Under Roman numeral XI, key findings, the second paragraph, once becoming regular smokers, young people still felt they were not addicted. Do you agree with that statement, sir? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

THE WITNESS:  You know, again, I'm  I'm going to go back to what I said before.  I am not an expert on -- on -- on addiction.  I just really can't comment on that. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  So as the person for R.J. Reynolds in charge of product stewardship which you've discussed and defined reducing the risks of smoking, as the person who R.J. Reynolds has designated as their expert to discuss RJR's, American Tobacco's and Brown & Williamson's research programs, including research into reducing the inherent risks of smoking --A.  Right.

Q.  -- you can't tell me one way or another *%YietSher young people once becoming regular smokers still feel they were not addicted ~-MR. KREINER:  Objection. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  -- whether you agree with that?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, you know, let me  let me -- let me try to explain.  All of the information that you started with has to do with an evaluation of the products, what

212-279-9424

ingredients are used in the products, what does the smoke chemistry look like in the products, how do changes to those products influence the smoke chemistry.  That's basic science. That's -- that's toxicology.  With respect to this, that is a -- that's a behavior or phenomenon, and that isn't really part of the product stewardship process that we would use for the evaluation of the products. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Nicotine is a chemical, is it not? A.  It is.

Q.  Nicotine reacts to the body in physical ways, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  It's not just a behavioral thing; nicotine actually causes a physical addiction.  As a toxicologist you know that?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know if I would  I don't know if I would say it causes a physical addiction.  It is active in a physiological sense in the body.  I think that's  that's well-known and understood.  When you say it causes a physical addiction, then you're

talking about drugs like -- like a heroin or alcohol where a person gets physically addicted, and when they stop using it they become ill.  That's -- that's not -- that's not the same with nicotine.  With nicotine it is --it is active from a physiological perspective, but I -- I would disagree with the fact that a person becomes physically addicted to it. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.  So you don't believe a smoker can become physically addicted to nicotine in cigarettes?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  Based on the definition that I just gave I would say yes. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Yes, you believe they can or you do not believe that they can become physically addicted? A.  Based on the definition I do not believe that they are physically addicted.

Q.  Okay.  And I know you're in charge of product stewardship, but you're  you are a vice president at R.J. Reynolds; is that correct? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

was there from the 1950s until approximately 1987,
	
does that sound accurate to you?
	
A.
	Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Do you have any reason to dispute that Dr. Teague before his retirement was the director of research and development?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I know he was a chemist by training.  I don't know what his -- what his title was when -- when he retired. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.  Sir, I'd like to show you a document we'll mark as MM 339.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I'll -- I'll represent to you, sir, that this is a RJR document from 1982 created by Dr. Teague.  If you'll look at the last page, do you see his signature -- his name and signature there?

A.  Yes, I do.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  That is his name though, correct? A.  Yeah.

Q.  Okay.  In your research of the hundred to 200 documents that you believe you looked at from R.J. Reynolds, B&W and American Tobacco Company in preparation to serve as an expert did you come across this document which is titled or is regarding Nordine Study, N-O-R-D-I-N-E Study? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I don't recall having seen this document before. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.  Let me -- if I could direct you to the first line, it says, most of the responses we, and then in parentheses R and D RJRT and/or the tobacco industry -- R and D stands for research and development, correct?

Q.  That was the department that you worked in for several years at R.J. Reynolds? A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  If we can go down to the middle of the page, the paragraph that starts with some other things perhaps not as ~- not as -- not quite so obvious need consideration.  The third bullet point down there, most of those who have stopped smoking -- strike that.  Let me try it again.

The third bullet point down there, most of those who have smoked for any significant time would like to stop.

Sir, do you agree with that, that based upon your work at R.J. Reynolds that most of those people who have smoked cigarettes for any significant time would like to stop?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, you know, again I  I haven't spent a lot of time  I'm not a behavioral psychologist.  You know, again my --my role in product stewardship was the evaluation of products from a risk perspective. So I really don't know -- again, this is 1982. I don't know what the attitudes of people were in 1982, whether if they had smoked for a long

time they would like to stop. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  As someone involved in product stewardship looking at the risks of smoking, does that concern you as far as a risk that this says here in an RJR document most of those who have smoked for any significant time would like to stop?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Does it -- does it concern me?  Well, I think -- I guess what I -- my first question would be if they'd like to stop then why don't they?  I mean, you know, as we talked about before, smoking can be difficult, can be a difficult habit for people to quit. For some people it can be a very difficult habit to quit.  But they can still quit.  You know, there's -- there are more former smokers in the United States today than there are current smokers.  So I guess my -- my question with that would be if there are smokers that have smoked for any significant period of time that want to stop, then why don't they stop? BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  In your job assessing -- assessing risk of cigarette products for R.J. Reynolds and product

212-279-9424

stewardship, have you ever looked Into why people

who want to stop smoking don't stop? A.  1 have not. Q.  How many scientists at R.J. Reynolds

currently have their primary job function of

researching nicotine addiction?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  X don't think there's any. And I can probably explain that.  Again, going -- going back probably to the f50s, you know, the foous from public health has been you need to reduce the risk of these products.  And we've taken sort of many steps -- and by we I mean all three companies -- have taken many steps over the ~~ the ensuing decades to reduce the tar of the products, to come up with, say, novel products like our Premier product and our Eclipse product, to, you know, in the 2000s, you know, we have --we have Snus, and we're trying to migrate people to less risky products.  So our foous has always been to reduce the risk of the products that are currently out there and to migrate people to other less risky products.  So that's sort of answer number one.

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=80
Page 81

Answer number two, with respect to the addictiveness of nicotine, that's sort of a --that's sort of a very amorphous space because I don't think there's any -- any consensus from public health, from previously the Surgeon General, and from currently from the FDA as to what it would take to make a less ~~ less addictive tobacco product.  If  if you're someone that sort of focuses the risk on nicotine, we have products with varying levels of nicotine going down to as low as .1 milligrams per cigarette, which is quite low when you consider some of the higher cigarettes on the market are about 1.7 milligrams of nicotine, but, you know -- you know, again, why -- why people smoke and what it would take to make a less -- a less addictive product there really hasn't been any guidance from either the Surgeon General or from the FDA in our current world as to what sort of -- what sort of path you would go down to be able to do that.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Understanding all that, so the answer is none, R.J. Reynolds does not have any scientists

THE WITNESS:  That's correct. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  If I can refer you to the -- to the last page of this document from Dr. Teague, which has been marked as MM 339.  We cannot be comfortable marketing a product which most of our customers would do without if they could; do you see that? A.  Hold on.

MR. KREINER:  Where are you? THE WITNESS:  I'm  I'm not following you.

Q.  We cannot be comfortable marketing a product which most of our customers would do without if they could; do you see that? A.  Uh-huh.

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Am I comfortable with R.J. Reynolds marketing and continuing to sell cigarettes?

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Yes. A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Do you agree that most of R.J. Reynolds' customers -- strike that.

Do you agree with Dr. Teague from 1982 that most customers would do without cigarettes if they could?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  No.  No, I don't think so. It's kind of back to the answer that I gave previously.  I mean, if  if they want to quit smoking, then they should quit smoking.  If they want to migrate to Snus or another tobacco product that carries less risk, we would like them to do that.  One of the companies under the  the RAI umbrella is a NRT company.  So we're actually making and selling products for people to use to quit smoking. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Sir, R.J. Reynolds has the technology to

remove nicotine from tobacco in its cigarettes, don't they?

A.  That's a  that's a chemistry question. I'm -- I'm going to do the best I can to answer it. I mean, I think certainly at a -- at a --at a lab scale, maybe at a pilot scale could we remove the nicotine from tobacco?  I think we probably could. Now, scaling that up to a -- to a larger level, I can't -- I'm -- I'm not sure.  I mean, it's -- it's feasible, but from a practical perspective I can't comment on that.  But I think is there  if the question is, is there technology that's out there today to remove nicotine from tobacco, I believe there is.

Q.  And, in fact, the companies have the ability to sell deniootinized cigarettes, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Would you agree with me then that removing the nicotine from cigarettes that R.J. Reynolds sells would reduce the risk --

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.   of those cigarettes?

A.  No.

Q.     Let me  say it again as  one thing because

we had an objection.  Would you agree with me that RJR reducing -- strike that.

Would you agree with me, sir, that removing the nicotine from cigarettes that it sells would be one way that R.J. Reynolds could reduce the risk of those cigarettes?

A.  No.  No, 1 would not agree with that. Q.  Okay.  Next, sir, we're going to mark a document, and I'll give it to you after.  I'll let her have a chance to mark it this time.  We'll mark this document MM 174.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.  We'll mark this next exhibit as MM 241.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit MM 241, Document titled Why We're Dropping The New York Times, was marked for identification.) BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Doctor, take an opportunity to look at MM 241.  I'll represent to you that this is -- well, strike that.

Doctor, MM 241, if you look at the bottom it says American Tobacco Company -- The American Tobacco Company; is that correct? A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  I'll represent to you, sir, that this is an ad taken out by The American Tobacco Company in The New York Times in 1969.  Are you familiar with this ad?

A.  I don't think I've seen this.

Q.  Okay.  Well, take an opportunity to look at it.  Have you had a chance to read it?

A.  Yes, I have.

Q.  All right.  Let me refer you to the -- it looks like the fourth paragraph down maybe.  It starts with, sure there are statistics.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Sure there are statistics associating lung cancer and cigarettes.  There are statistics associating lung cancer with divorce and even with lack of sleep.  But there are no sci  but no scientist has produced clinical or biological proof that cigarettes cause the diseases that they are accused of causing.  Did I read that correctly?

A.  You did.

Q.  All right.  So, based upon your review of the historical research, in 1969 was it a commonly held belief that lung cancer could be caused by divorce and lack of sleep?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

Page 96

THE WITNESS:  I have not seen anything to suggest either of those two. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.  If we go down to the next paragraph -- well, strike that.

So, based on your prior answer, if American Tobacco Company was stating in The New York Times in 1969 that there are statistics associating lung cancer with divorce and even lack of sleep, is that inaccurate?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, again, I don't know if it's accurate or inaccurate.  All -- all I can say is I've never looked for statistics relating lung cancer to divorce or lung cancer to lack of sleep.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  But you did study the tobacco companies1, specifically American Tobacco, Brown & Williamson, R.J. Reynolds, historical research programs about the risks of smoking, right? A.  Correct.

Q.  And you never came across anything that suggested that lung cancer could be caused by divorce or lack of sleep, have you?

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=96
Page 97

A.  No.

Q.  Okay.  If we go down to the next -- two paragraphs down, therefore, we are not going to knuckle under to the Times or anybody else who tries to force us to accept a theory which, in the opinion of men who should know, is half-baked.  Did I read that right? A.  You did.

Q.     Based upon your review, Dr. Garner, of the historical research regarding the inherent risks of smoking, in 1969 was the theory that lung cancer can be caused by smoking half-baked?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, I mean, I guess  I guess it depends on your perspective.  I mean, the -- the part that you did not read I think is -- is quite important.  Sure there are statistics associating lung cancer with cigarettes.  That -- that was very clear, and  and they were very upfront about stating that in this advertisement.  Their view, you know, again stated in the other passage that you didn't read, after 15 years of trying, no one has induced lung cancer in animals with cigarette smoke, that's another key piece to

212-279-9424

212-490-3430pgNbr=97
Page 98

it.  The -- the ~- what they're speaking about in the first sentence that I read with respect to statistics that is the -- the epidemiology, right, so the increase in lung cancer with smokers as compared to nonsmokers, and if you look at any -- any text on epidemiology it will say that epidemiology does not prove cause.  It just shows that there is an association.  So I believe that's what they were referring to in this ad, that there is an increase in risk, but the cause has not been proven.  I think that's what they're saying in this ad. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Thank you for that, Dr. Garner.  My question is this:  Based upon your research, and you come here today as an expert in the tobacco companies' historical research into the risks of smoking, based upon your research, in 1969 was the theory that cigarette smoking can cause lung cancer half-baked?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  Nell, you know, again, I  the term half-baked is not a scientific term. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  You don't know what half-baked means?

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=98
Page 99

A.  I know what half-baked means.  But I don't know what they meant by half-baked.  If  if --

Q.  What does half-baked mean to you?

A. Half-baked means it's incomplete, right, half-baked.

Q.  Okay.

A.  So from their perspective I think what they were saying is that the risk was clear, and they -- in this -- in this ad they actually -- to me this  this is an acknowledgment of the risk, but I think what they're referring to as half-baked is they don't think the causal link has been proven.  That's  that's my interpretation by reading this.

Q.  So to you half-baked just means not finished yet?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Okay.  So if somebody called an idea that you had half-baked you wouldn't be offended by that?

A.  Well, in that case it means something that is not -- not credible or not realistic I guess.

Q. Okay. So if we apply that definition to this, not credible or not realistic, sir, in 1969 was the belief or the theory rather that cigarette

smoking could cause lung cancer not credible or not realistic?

MR. KRE1NER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, I mean, I  I think as a theory it was realistic.  I mean, I think what  what they're referring to in this is that it has not been proven. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  So the answer to the question is in 1969 you believe that the theory that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer was half-baked?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Do I believe in 1969? MR. KREXNER:  Objection to the form. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Yeah.

A.  I think there was information out there that was  you know, back to the statistics was suggestive that there was a relationship.  Had it been proven conclusively?  Probably not.

Q.  So then you wouldn't fault cigarette smokers of RJR products back in 1969 for not believing that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer, would you?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

THE WITNESS:  Well, you know, again there -- there was a lot of information out there in 1969.  There -- there was information in  you know, the Surgeon General's first report came out in 1964, and that certainly was -~ was aired fairly --BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Sir, that's not what I asked you.

MR. KREINER:  Well, no, no.  Let him finish or withdraw the question. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Let me ask you this.  Let me ask you this. MR. KREINER:  Are you withdrawing the question?  I want this on the record.  He's entitled to finish or you withdraw the question.

MR. PRYSOCK:  He's not answering the question.

MR. KREINER:  You're entitled to finish or you withdraw the question. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Go ahead -- go ahead and answer how you want to, sir, and then I'll ask you the question again that I asked since you're not answering it. A.  Well

MR. KREINER:  Object to the comment.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  Can you ask the question again because I've -- I've got a little bit off track with the --

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Sure, that's fine.  Let me ask it this way:  If a smoker of R.J. Reynolds' cigarettes in 1969 believed that the theory that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer is half-baked --A.  Uh-huh. Q.  -- would you fault that smoker?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Would I fault that smoker? BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Yeah.

A.  I don't know if I could -- I don't  I don't see how fault really plays in to it.  I mean, I think as I -- as I tried to say --

Q. Would you believe it's credible that a smoker in 1969 did not believe that lung cancer caused smoking and thought that that theory was half-baked?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form, and again, I'd request that you allow him to finish

his answer instead of interrupting him.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  X think most of the evidence in 1969 starting from articles in Reader's Digest in the '50s, Life Magazine in the '50s, information following the release of the first Surgeon General's report in 1964 all pointed to the fact that they thought cigarette smoking was a causative factor in the development of lung cancer.  So I think the preponderance of the evidence was suggesting that.  Now, are there -- were there some people at that time that were not fully bought in to that theory? Yeah, there probably were.  But, again, I'm not going to fault any individual smoker for what they thought.  It's based on what type of research they did to try to understand as much as they could about the product that they chose to actually use.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  What if that research by a smoker in 1969 consisted of reading this ad that the American Tobacco Company took out in The New York Times, would you believe it's incredible that a person would not believe cigarette smoking caused lung

cancer?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, you know, again, you're asking me to try to understand what somebody reading this ad a number of years ago would think.  But if -- if -'- if they read this, I think the first part that they should focus on sure there are statistics associating lung cancer and cigarettes.  If I read that, I would probably say, well, I don't understand all this animal stuff, and I don't understand what the cause might be, but if there's statistics that associate cigarette smoking with lung cancer, I better take this seriously. That's -- that's how I would read it if I was a cigarette smoker in 1969. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.     Would you take it less seriously if you then read the next sentence that says there are statistics associating lung cancer with divorce and even lack of sleep?

A.  Yeah, I don't understand that -- that sentence, but I think if there are statistics associating lung cancer and cigarettes, that would  that would get my attention if I was a

smoker in 1969 and I saw this ad and I was trying to make a decision about whether to continue smoking.  1 would take that seriously.

Q.  What about someone who is considering getting a divorce, would they -- should they take that next line seriously?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I you know, again, I don't -- I don't know what they're referring to with those two comments. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  We'll mark this next exhibit as 304, MM 304.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit MM 304, Memorandum to M. J. McCue from H. D. Steele, was marked for identification.)

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Sir, if you'd look at Exhibit MM 304, do you see the date there it says August 24, 1978? A.  Yes, X do.

Q.  All right.  I'll represent to you that this is a Brown &  Williamson document from 1978. Did you come across this document in your research? A.  It's not one that I recognize. Q.  Okay.  So in your research on the inherent

212-279-9424

risks of cigarette smoking from the companies and looking at their documents you didn't come across this document?

A.  No.

Q.  Let me refer you to the second paragraph, sir.  Very few customers -- strike that.

Very few consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, i.e., its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Did X read that correctly?

A.  You did.

Q.  All right.  Do you agree, sir, that nicotine -- the effect of nicotine is its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I'm  I'm going to break it up into two different answers. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  That's  I'll  I'll ask the question again and I'll break it up for you.

A.  Okay.

Q.     Sir,   do you agree that one of  the effects of  nicotine  is  its  addictive nature?

A.     Yeah,   I mean,   I   think people have known  --

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=106

this is 1978.

Q.  Yes, sir.

A.  People have known for decades that smoking is very hard to quit, and people have known for decades that a role in that is due to -- to nicotine.

Q.  Okay.

A.  So I think that's  that's not true because I think that was fairly common knowledge at that particular time.

Q.  All right.  So the first part of that sentence then that says, very few consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, you disagree with that?

A.  Well, again, I think very few -- I would disagree that very few consumers are aware of the addictive nature of nicotine used in a -- in a general context.

Q.  So you disagree with the author of this Brown &  Williamson document from 1978 when he says, very few consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, its addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison?

MR. KREINER:  Object to the form.

THE WITNESS:  Well, again, if -- if  if

212-279-9424

you will -- if you let me break them up, I think the  what he is calling -~ he or she is calling the addictive nature of nicotine I think that was very common knowledge in 1978. Smoking is difficult to quit.  We've.-- we've already covered that ground.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.

A.  People -- people knew that. Q.  It's the --

MR. KREINER:  Let him finish.  Please, Greg, let him finish.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Sure.  Well, he's not answering the question.

MR. KREINER:  Let him finish, Greg.

MR. PRYSOCK:  He's not answering the question.

THE WITNESS:  Now, the 

MR. KREINER:  Then you move to strike and you ask a new question.  He's entitled to finish his answer.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, I don't need to move to strike.  We can strike it later from the deposition, but go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  I think the second part of

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=108
Page 109

the question is probably correct.  At -- at high doses I would say that saying that nicotine is a poison is -- is correct, and 1 think -- I think a lot of people are not -- at that timet and probably still today to a certain extent do not know that.  So I would say half o it is -- half of it is correct, the other half I disagree with. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  So, Dr. Garner, do you disagree with this document from H. D. Steele at Brown & Williamson in 1978 that very few consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, i.e., its addictive nature? A.  Yeah, I disagree with that. Q.  Thank you, sir.  In 1978 were you studying cigarettes?

A.  In 1978? Q.  Yes. A.  No.

Q.  In 1978  A.  Was I me? Q.  Yes.

A.  Or was I R.J. Reynolds?

Q.  No, you.  Were you studying the effects of nicotine in 1978?

A.  No.

Q.  Were you studying the awareness of consumers of cigarettes regarding the effects of nicotine in 1978? A.  No.

Q.  Would you agree with me that a scientist at Brown & Williamson may be in a better position to understand consumers' knowledge regarding the effects of nicotine in 1978?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, again, I don't know who H. D. Steele is and what his or her background could be.  I'm -- when I -- when I made my comments about people knowing about the, quote, unquote, addictive nature of smoking, 1978 I was 22 years old.  I may have been smoking at the time.  I had friends that smoked, and I think it was fairly common knowledge that smoking can be difficult to quit.  So that's what I'm basing my -- my view on.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Sir, I'd like to show you a document that we'll mark as MM 224.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Thank you.  We1re going to mark this next exhibit as MM 371.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 371 was marked and then withdrawn.)

THE WITNESS:  Oh, boy.

MR. KREINER:  What do you want to do about a lunch break?

MR. PRYSOCK:  We can go off a second. It1s up to you.

VIDEOGRAPHER:  Do you want to go off the record?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yeah, yeah.  Well, you don't -- it doesn't matter.  Keep it on.  I don't have a tremendous amount more.  We can --are you going to have anything?

MR. KREINER:  Right now I'm thinking 15, 20 minutes maybe.

MR. PRYSOCK:  All right.  Well, I'll leave it up to the doctor.  I've probably got 15 or 20 more minutes.  I think we'll wrap this whole thing up in an hour.  Do you want to take a lunch break or do you want to forge ahead and finish?

THE WITNESS:  My  so you think after

MR. PRYSOCK THE WITNESS MR. PRYSOCK THE WITNESS

Total, yeah. For -- for you? Yeah.

Well, since you're on a roll, let's ~~ let's get done, then we'll have some lunch, and then we'll come back and let Mr. Kreiner wrap it up.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, let's go ahead and take a break now then.  I mean, if we're going to take a break for lunch, I'm starving, so  MR. KREINER:  Off the record. MR. PRYSOCK:  I guess my suggestion was either we forge all the way through or we go eat lunch now.  If we're going to take --

THE WITNESS:  Well, if you're starving  MR. PRYSOCK:  Yeah.

-- let's -- let's eat lunch

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Dr. Garner, we're back on the record. A.  Okay.

Q.  We took a break for lunch, correct? A.  Yeah.

Q.  Did you talk with your counsel during lunch about your testimony? A.  Did not.

Q.  Okay.  Let me ask you this:  Does RJR put ammonia in any of its cigarettes? A.  Yes, we do.

Q.  Okay.  And that's a practice that's been going on for a number of years, correct? A.  That's correct.

Q.  I told you I was going to try to cut it short.  So I'll tell you what, I'm not even going to go into that. A.  Okay.

MR. KREINER:  We have no objection to that.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  Doctor, I saw in a prior deposition in the Odom case some testimony or questions about Levulinic acid.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Dr. Garner, does RJR add Levulinic acid in any of its -- let me ask the question again. Dr. Garner, does R.J. Reynolds add Levulinic acid to any of its cigarettes that it sells to consumers?

A.  No.

Q.  Have they ever added Levulinic acid?

A.  I believe in the past we may have added it to -- to a few brands, but I know currently it's not a list of one of the ingredients that we use.

Q.  Any form of Levulinic acid?

A.  I'm not sure about that.

Q.  Okay.  So it's possible that R.J. Reynolds does add a form of Levulinic acid?

A.  Oh, currently?

Q.  Yes.

A.  No.  No.

Q. Okay. I think I misunderstood you. Let me ask again.

Does -- does R.J. Reynolds currently add any form of Levulinic acid to its cigarettes?

A.  No.

Q.  When is the last time RJR added Levulinic acid to its cigarettes that it sells to the American public in year?  It doesn't have to be a precise date.

A.  I -- I don't have an exact date.  I believe when I started with the company in * 95 I believe it was one of our ingredients then.  But we have -- you know, over the years we have dropped the numbers of ingredients that we use, and we currently are not using that today.

Q.  Has it been over a decade since RJR added any form of Levulinic acid to its cigarettes?

A.  I probably can't answer that with any specificity.  I -- my feeling is it's been more than a decade, but I'm not  but I don't have an exact date.

Q. Understood. Are you confident that it's been more than five years since RJR has added any form of had Levulinic acid to its cigarettes?

A.  I'm reasonably confident.

Q.  Okay.  When you were asked about Levulinlc acid previously you didn't know the answer.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  As we sit here today, you have now answered it.  How did you come to find out this information?

A.  Well, I -- obviously I did some research as to why would he be asking me this question, and it was an additive that we had used and it was an additive that we had used in sort of some work that we had done on reduced risk tobacco products, more specifically with respect to a Russell cigarette, which is a cigarette that has an altered TN ratio, and the Levulinlc acid was used as an ingredient to make those products more -~ more -- more acceptable from a sensory perspective.

Q.  Would you agree with me, sir, that adding Levulinlc acid to cigarettes actually increases the binding of nicotine when it's inhaled by a cigarette smoker?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  No, I would not. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  Okay.  What effect, if any, does Levulinic acid have on nicotine in a cigarette when it's

O)

consumed by a smoker?

A.  I -~ I believe it has no -- no effect whatsoever.  X mean, it's used as an ingredient for sensory purposes.  I don't think it has any impact on the -- on the form or the absorption of nicotine.

Q.  Why is -- why was Levulinic acid added to RJR cigarettes?

A.  Well, the reason it was added to sort of let's -- let's call it our conventional cigarettes was for its sensory characteristics, its taste properties.  The reason it was investigated for use in a Russell cigarette, which is a reduced TN ratio cigarette, was to help sort of balance the  balance the sensory properties as those tar and nicotine ratios were  were modified.

Q.  So Levulinic acid has a good taste, that's why it was added?

A.  I don't know if -r-I don't know if I'd say it in itself has a good taste, but in combination with the tobacco taste and the other additives used that particular mix had a good taste for that particular product.

Q.  I may have asked you this.  If I did, I apologize, but how many years did R.J. Reynolds add

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=121

Levulinic acid to its cigarettes?

A.  I don't -- I don't have that information.

Q.  Okay.  We talked earlier about the specifications of the cigarettes --

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  -- and the actual precise ingredients of the cigarettes.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you talked about the list that RJR keeps.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  If Levulinic acid was in a cigarette, would it be on that list of ingredients?

A.  Yes, it would.

Q.  Okay.

A. As a matter of fact, that's what I checked in preparation after my last deposition, and then I confirmed that.

Q.  Okay.  Did you check each brand manufactured by R.J. Reynolds to see --

A.  No.  I  I checked the common list of ingredients that would be used across brands, because if I checked every individual brand, that might be a proprietary flavor and would not be listed as such, but it would be in the full list

of -- of ingredients that we used in our cigarettes.

Q.  I'm sorry.  I was talking about proprietary list where it actually says the ingredients in a particular brand of cigarette that is not available to the public that you talked about earlier.

A.  Right.

Q.  I'm not talking about the public list that just generally lists, you know --

A.  So your question is:  Would Levulinic acid show up on the individual brand style ingredient listing?

Q.  Yes.

A.  Probably not because that's at such a low level that would probably be considered one of the proprietary ingredients.  Am I not -- I'm not making myself clear, am 1?

Q.  It's probably me, not you, but I thought there was a  the list  when you say proprietary ingredients, what do you mean by that?

A.  Okay.  Let me  let me try to explain it.

Q.  Sure.

A.      Okay.     When  you  go   to  R JRT.com  and you look  under product  ingredients,   you  click  on  that

and you have a couple options.  So you can say --let's say you smoke Camel Blue hard pack, you can click on Camel Blue hard pack and it will show you let's call it a partial list of the ingredients. So it will show the  the high level ingredients that are fairly common like cocoa and licorice, what we call the -*- the casing ingredients, and then there will be sort of  much like on the can of Coke that you're drinking it will say flavoring ingredients.  So those would be very low level, the specific ingredients that are proprietary much like the Coke and Pepsi comment I made earlier.  So you can't look at an individual brand style and see everything because that would essentially give our formula up, right?  So there's another one that you can check, and that's list of all ingredients, and that includes everything that is used across all the brand styles.

So back to the original question, if Levulinio acid was used today, it would show up on that second list and it does not.

Q.  Understood on all the public list.

A.  Okay.

Q.     What  I'm talking about  is  the specifications   that we discussed earlier  that you

said are kept in a vault by R.J. Reynolds --

A.  Right.

Q.  --as to the specific ingredients in the brand.  That list includes those proprietary ingredients, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  So if Levulinic acid was being used in a particular RJR brand --

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  --you could go to that list to find out if it was actually in a particular brand, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.

A.  But the fact that it's not on our common list of ingredients tells me that it's not used in any of the brands.

Q.  I understand that.

A.  Okay.

Q.  The thing I'm getting at, sir, is that you said it's not used nowadays.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  And you can't tell me when the last time it was used.

A.  Right.

Q.     So  if  there  is  a  specification  list,   the

212-279-9424

212-490-3430pgNbr=125

proprietary specification list for example Camel --

A.  Okay.

Q.  *-- from ten years ago --

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  --that RJR has it would be on that list whether Levulinic acid was used ten years ago, correct?

A.  Well, you know, again, we don't have a proprietary specification list for ten years ago. I'd have to go back into the individual documentation, you know, as I -- and I apologize if I'm restating this again, but, you know, we don't have a year-by-year spec change document.  I'd have to go back and look at the individual documents.

Q.      R.J. Reynolds doesn't have a list from ten years ago as to what was in Camel cigarettes?

A.  Maybe ten years ago we sort of have that perhaps in a  in a database sometime, but I'm talking about going back -~ way back in history.

Q.  I understand, and you made that point earlier about the '50s or whatever.

A.  Okay.

Q.     But  I'm talking about more  recent.

A.     Okay.      I  believe we  can  go back  a  certain number  of years.      I  don't know how many  that  --

that is.

Q.  Okay.  You are familiar with the brand Camel Crush, aren't you?

A.  Yes, I am.

Q.  All right.  How long has Camel Crush been on the market?

A.  2006 time frame, something like that.

Q.  All right.  And Camel Crush is a  it's a conventional cigarette that has the addition of a -- some type of bead of menthol or something where it can be squeezed and the menthol can be inhaled?

A.  Right.  It's basically a  a capsule that's soft, so instead of application of menthol to the tobacco, which you would find in a -- any other standard menthol cigarette, it's in a capsule in the filter.  So you can smoke it as a nonmenthol product and then squeeze the filter, pop the capsule and it becomes a menthol product.

Q,     Okay.  And Camel Crush -~ strike that. That -- that mechanism that you just described was called Cool Burst technology, correct?

A.  I'm -- I'm -- I don't know what the name of the technology is.

Q.  Okay.

A.  But we call it -- it's -- the technology is referred to as capsule technology because the menthol is contained in the capsule.

Q.  Okay.  RJR considers Camel Crush a growth brand, doesn't it?

A.  Yes.

Q.     All right.  And what is a growth brand?

A.  Well, again, I'm -- I'm not -~ I'm not a marketing guy.

Q.  Right.

A.  But I think there are certain brand styles that we have that we -- we try to grow sales.  So we put  we put some advertising dollars on those brands.  We have other brands that we don't.  And there's -- Camel -- Camel is one.

Q.  That you don't?

A.  That we call a growth brand.

Q.  Oh, okay.  And specifically Camel Crush is considered a growth brand, isn't it?

A.  I think the whole Camel family is a growth brand, so Camel Crush is part of the Camel family, so -- so yes.

Q.  Okay.  Would you agree with me that a growth brand is seeking to  the goal of a growth

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424                                   www.veritext.com                                  212-490-3430pgNbr=128

brand is to switch current tobacco users from other products to that growth brand product, correct?

A.  Switch smokers from other products to that product.

Q.  Thank you.  You said it better.  And also to  to try to bring in new customers to smoking that product?

A.  I think the primary goal is to switch people that are already smokers and move them to their products.  If -- if -- and if -- if an adult chooses to start smoking, we would prefer that they smoke our product but --as long as they understand the risks, but our primary goal is to -- because, you know, you've seen the smoking statistics.  I think smoking rates are going down, so the focus now is to try to get people to convert from other brand styles to our brands.

Q.  So are you saying that part of the -- part of the goal of a growth brand is not to get new smokers, even new adult smokers?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  Strike that.  Let me ask it again.

Are you saying that the goal of a growth brand or part of the goal of a growth brand is not

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY j_              www.veritext.com

Page 130

to get new smokers?

A.  Well, you know, again, I think we -- we target our -- our brands at adult smokers over 21, and if -~ if people are going to make a decision that they want to smoke and they're over 21 and of legal age, then they may be drawn to our products. But I think the number of new smokers is decreasing.  The number of current smokers is decreasing, so the best type of opportunity we have is to get people to convert from one brand to another.

Q.  But you would agree that a new smoker is more likely to seek out a growth brand rather than a more traditional brand?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  You know, again, I don't know what -- what you mean by that.  I mean, a new smoker is going to seek out whatever brand -- probably whatever brand his peer group is smoking, and if it happens to be one of our growth brands, then it happens to be one of our growth brands.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.     Okay.  You talked about statistics in smoking, and you said the trend is that there's

212-279-9424

212-490-3430pgNbr=130

less smoking today.or something. I don't want to put words in your mouth; is that correct what you said?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  I'm going to show you a document that we're going to mark as Plaintiff's Exhibit --why don't we just do it as 1 for this deposition since it does not have an MM number.

MR. KREINER:  Do you have a copy? MR. PRYSOCK:  No, but I'll let you have it and you can make a copy.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit 1, Document from Business Insider, was marked for identification.)

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.     And just for the record I'm going to show you a document that is an article from Business Insider Magazine from May 18, 2012. A.  Okay.

MR. KREINER:  I'll look at it first. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.  I'm sorry. A.  Okay.

Q.     Dr. Garner, according to this article Camel and this is as of May 2012  Camel had

212-279-9424

212-490-3430pgNbr=131
Page 132

increased its market share among 12 to 17-year-olds by 21 percent.

Do you agree with that statistic? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, again, I've  I've never seen that article before and I don't know where that information came from.  I've --the -~ the data that I look -- look at from --for like smoking trends, that comes from, say, the CDC.  I don't know what -- where that information came from.  I mean, let's be clear. You know, our view as a company that, you know, people under the legal age of smoking should not be smoking.  So certainly we wouldn't even follow that kind of information. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Has that always been RJR's view? A.  Yes, I believe it has.  I mean, we have --you know, we  we sponsor the We Card Program.  We sponsor and we have been sponsoring since -- since the '90s a program called Right -- Right  Right Decisions Right Now that focuses on kids and smoking, and then letting them know that this is a decision that should not be made until you're of the appropriate legal age to -- to be able to make

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=132
Page 133

that -- that type of a -- type of a decision.  So, you know, again, I -- I haven't followed that --that information.  But it's not something that we as a company would condone.

Q.  So RJR has never marketed its cigarettes to children under the age of 18?

A.  Well, you know, again, I've never worked in the marketing department, but since I've been with the company, the view has always been we -- we focus on what we call adult -- ASU 21, adult smokers over 21.  I've been with the company for almost  a little over 18 years, going on 20 years, and that has always been our foous with respect to marketing.

Q.  They didn't used to call it ~- what did you say, AD --

A.  ASU, adult smokers  ASU 21.  ATU, adult tobacco users over 21.

Q.  All right.  Well, RJR used to have a phrase for -- a phrase called YAS, right, Y-A-S young adult smokers; have you heard that term?

A.  I have not.

Q.  Have you ever seen any documents with that term?

A.  I have not.

Page 134

Q.     So you've never seen any statistics or graph as to what it considers young adult smokers?

A.  I have not.  I've been focusing more on the documents that are pertinent to my area of expertise and not the -- not the marketing documents.

Q.  This article that we've referred to as Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 from Business Insider Magazine also says that the gain in market share by Camel between 12 -- of 12 and 17-year-olds is attributed to Camel Crush cigarettes.  Do you disagree that Camel Crush cigarettes have increased Camel's market share among 12-to-17-year-olds? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, the -- the share of the Camel Crush in general has -~ has not skyrocketed.  It's increased, but, again, I havenTt looked at that particular segment because we don't market to 12-to-17-year-olds. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.  All right, Dr. Garner, I think this is the last exhibit.  I'm going to show you an exhibit that we're going to mark as  we'll do it as Plaintiff's Exhibit 2 to this deposition because I can't remember the MM number.

Q.  Well, let me just identify it, then I'll give you a chance to read it --'

A.  Okay.

Q.  -- Dr. Garner.  This is a portion of the deposition taking -- taken of Robert Heimann on --started on December 19, 1986, in the Horton case. Okay.  Now, It'll give you a chance to read -- we've got Pages 100 through 102 there.

Company for a period of time.

Q.  And it was an extended period of time, wasn't it, from I believe the early '70s to 1980s?

A.  That feels about right.

Q.  And you've mentioned that you didn't know if Mr. Heimann was the -- was the head of ATC at the time of this deposition, right?

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Okay.  I'm going to read to you a stipulation that was done in that case.  Comes now The American Tobacco Company through counsel and stipulates to the court that the position of The American Tobacco Company on issues of smoking and health from 1980 until the present are exactly as expressed in the deposition of Robert K. Heimann. Do you understand that stipulation?

A.  I believe I do.

Q. Okay. So I'll represent to you then that at the time this deposition was taken this was the position of American Tobacco Company on the issues of smoking and health, okay?

A.  Okay.

Q.     Let's  go  to  Page  101,   please.     Mr.   Heimann is  asked:     You  don't  think  it harmed smokers  so there's  no  reason  to put any warning on  them,   do

you?  And the response is:  Believe our product is not injurious to health.  Do you see that? A.  I do.

Q.  Sir, in your research that you've done in preparation as an expert in this case into the testing and understanding of the inherent risks of smoking by American Tobacco Company did you see anywhere that in 1986 American Tobacco Company did not believe that cigarette smoking can injure a smoker's health?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, I mean, I think the  the document that we looked at previously, the advertisement in I believe it was The New York Times where they referenced the -- the statistics to the relationship between smoking and lung cancer, certainly they -- they were - I mean, this is '86 going back to 1969, they knew about the epidemiology.  So I think what he appears to be referring to here is the --the causal phase of it as opposed to sort of the risk factor phase, if that  if that's clear.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  He says, they do not believe our product

212-279-9424

is injurious to health; do you see that? A.  I do.

Q.  Okay.  So in 1986 was it still a half-baked idea that cigarette smoking was injurious to smokers1 health?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, again, I don't know what he means by injurious to health.  They stated publicly that it was a risk factor in 1969.  So when he says is not injurious to health, my conclusion from reading this is he is pointing to the -- the causal part of that. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Where did they state that publicly in 1969, in that ad that we looked at earlier? A.  Yeah.

Q.  Okay.  So it's your belief that ad was American Tobacco Company telling its customers that smoking could cause any type of harm?

A.  No, my -- what it says in there he talks about the risks and the statistics of smoking and lung cancer.  To me that points to the epidemiology when that body of evidence has been building over -- over the years.

Q.  Where does Mr. Heimann talk about the

212-279-9424

212-490-3430pgNbr=138

statistics in epidemiology when it says, you don't think it harms smokers so there is no reason to put any warning on them, do you?

A.  He doesn't talk about that in here. Q.  Answer -~ answer:  Believe our product is not injurious to health.

So this was American Tobacco's Company --American Tobacco Company's official position in 1986 to its customers that they did not believe smoking -- strike that.

This was American Tobacco Company's official position back in 1986 to its customers that it did not believe its product was injurious to their health?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  If it's what Mr. Heimann stated in response to the question, he does not believe that our product is injurious to health.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  And my question is this:  Is that official position by Mr. Heimann on behalf of American Tobacco Company in 1986 consistent with what you found in the research of American Tobacco's testing related to understanding and reducing the risks of

smoking?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

THE WITNESS:  Well, again, testing and understanding the risks of smoking would bring a lot of things into play.  And, you know, again, I -- I don't know what he means by not injurious to health.  I mean, I think the --the risks and the relationship to the epidemiology have been understood and have been stated by American Tobacco.  When he says they're not injurious to health, I  I don't know what he's actually referring to.  If -- if you go to the --to the next question where he talks about cause, my only conclusion I can draw from seeing this is that since he has  since American Tobacco publicly stated in 1969 that there -- there were statistics that associated smoking with lung cancer, the only thing I can conclude from this is that he's pointing to the causal link, and he is suggesting that cause has not been demonstrated appropriately.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  You don't know what not injurious to health means?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I know what not injurious to health means, and that's what he says.  But it seems a little inconsistent with his previous statement, so, again, the conclusion I can draw is that it's related to the causal link. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.     Now when you were looking at all these documents from American Tobacco Company and Brown & Williamson -- well, strike that.  Let me ask you just related to American Tobacco Company.

When you were looking at these documents from American Tobacco Company on the research of smoking and health  A.  Uh-huh.

Q.   did you find any research that American Tobacco Company -~ scientists had done before 1986 that says cigarette smoking is injurious to health? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I don't think so. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  In 1986 was it also RJR's position that cigarette smoking was not injurious to health? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I don't believe it was.  I

think the  the position that was held by Reynolds at the time was an acknowledgment of the epidemiology which linked increased risk for lung cancer to smoking.  X think the position in 1986 was that that causal link had not yet been proven.  I don't think ~- Reynolds did not deny that smoking caused lung cancer. What they said is the  the -- the increased risk is a proven fact, but the fact that it was a cause versus, say, a risk factor had not yet been ~- been sufficiently proven.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  The next question in this deposition is: As far as you are concerned, is the Surgeon General simply wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?

Answer:  I would use the term misguided.

Question:  And if he is misguided then I take it that your opinion is he is wrong?

Answer:  I was simply trying to be polite about it.

Question:  All right.  But not being polite about it in your opinion he is wrong?

Answer:  Dead wrong.

Do you believe in 1986 that the Surgeon

General of the United States was dead wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Well, it's  you know, it's tough for me to get in a time machine and go back to 1986, but I think looking back I think the Surgeon General probably was right, and that's what we state on our website today.  But it's obvious that in 1986 Mr. Heimann did not agree, and, you know, again, this gets to the point that I was making earlier.  They talk about the Surgeon General is wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.  I don't think he was saying that there wasn't a risk.  I think what he's saying is is it a cause or is it one of the many risk factors that could be related to the development of lung cancer.  That's -- that's my reading of this. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I understand you can't go back in a time machine, sir.  But wasn't what you were brought here today to do was to talk about the historical perspective of these tobacco companies as related

to smoking and health research?

A.  Yes.  Yes, it was.

Q.  So you are in effect going back in a time machine with your testimony?

A.  What I'm saying is X can't go back and figure out what Mr. Heimann was saying in this, but I think linking the ad from 1969 and the view of American Tobacco with respect to the risk of smoking, that was never in question.  X think what he is -- is in disagreement with the Surgeon General about is the causal link, and I believe he -- his view is that that causal link has not been proven in a -- in a satisfactory manner.

Q.  So in 198 6 based upon your historical research --

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.   do you believe that the Surgeon General was wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  Do I believe that? BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  Yes.

A.     Well,   X   think  now  that     that  in  2013  and from 2000   that's  been our view,   that  smoking  causes

cancer, so --

Q.  Do you think it was reasonable in 1986?

MR. KREINER:  Well, let him  please let him finish.  You interrupted him again.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Go ahead.

MR. KREINER:  Go ahead, Doctor.

THE WITNESS:  All right.  What I was trying to say is that's our view now, so apparently the Surgeon General was right.  Was that -- was that a reasonable view?  Yeah, I mean, I don't think it was the predominant view, but I think it was reasonable.  They --many of the tobacco companies at the time --you know, again, there -- there was an acknowledgment about the risk associated with smoking, but there is a difference between something being a risk factor and something being a cause, and there are certain tenets of the scientific method that would be required to demonstrate cause.  For example, the -- the ability to create the same type of an effect in an animal model, that was not present in 1986. Frankly, that's still not present in 2013, the identification of the agent or combination of

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritextxom.

212-490-3430pgNbr=145
Page 146

agents in cigarette smoke that cause cancer in that animal model as well as the mechanism. Now, there have been a number of chemicals that have been identified as possibly being responsible, there are a number of mechanisms that have been identified as being possibly responsible, but that still has not been conclusively proven.  But I think the weight of the epidemiology has shifted in such a way that the way the Surgeon General stated it in 2004 was that the weight of the evidence is sufficient to infer causation, and I think that pretty much sums it up in a nutshell.  In 1986 apparently Mr. Heimann had a -- had a different view of that. Q.  And American Tobacco as a company had a different view of that?

A.  Apparently.  If -- if Mr. Heimann is speaking for American Tobacco and not as an individual, then that would be correct.

Q.  When did you start at R.J. Reynolds? A.  1995.

Q.  When you started at R.J. Reynolds in 1995, did you believe that the Surgeon General was wrong in concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung

212-279-9424

212-490-3430pgNbr=146

cancer?

A.  Probably not.

Q.  Did RJR publicly state that it believed cigarette smoking caused lung cancer in 1995?

A.  In 1995 I don't know -- I don't know if we had a public position.  We ~- we changed our position probably about five  five years later.

Q.  So you don't know if RJR had a public opinion about it at all in 1995?

A.  X believe -- 1 believe the publio opinion was very similar to what I just previously stated. The -- the risks of smoking and lung cancer were very clear from the epidemiology.  So clearly it was a risk factor.  Whether it had been proven to be a cause using the, you know, standard scientific method at the time, I don't think cause -- cause had been proven satisfactorily -- satisfactorily at that particular point.

Q.  You said the reason that you didn't believe cause had been proven was because animal models had not been set up to show that -~ how did you say it?  I'm sorry.

A.  Well, there were probably three -- three main tenets.  Number one, there -- there have never been animal models that when they are exposed to

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritextcom

212-490-3430pgNbr=147
Page 148

cigarette smoke they will develop lung cancer. It's kind of odd.  There have been a number of chemicals thtit have been identified in cigarette smoke as being possible agents to cause the cancer. But I don't think any -- any one of them singularly or combination has been demonstrated to cause lung cancer, and then the last thing is the mechanism of how that is caused there are some -- some theories out there about what mechanisms might be responsible, but I still don't think that has been -- been conclusively proved.

Q.  So would it be reasonable for someone today to state that cigarette smoking does not cause lung cancer because the animal models still have not proven it?

A.  From -- from my view as -- you know, as a scientist, I mean, I think -- you know, again, I'm going to point back to our changing our views in early 2000 and the language in the 2004 Surgeon General's report, I think the weight of the  * -epidemiology is sufficient to infer that it causes, and that's -- that was probably the basis of our changing our view in the --in the early 2000s.

Q.  Are you saying that was the basis for the change in view and not a settlement of litigation

something in that range.

PERSONAL/CONFIDENTIAL MATERIAL REDACTED

Q.  And in addition to your salary do you receive end-of-year bonuses?

A.  I am eligible for a bonus at the end of the year, and I think that is -- the target is

percent of my salary, and that is based on many --many factors.  It's based on my  my performance in my job -- in my day job as well as some performance metrics on the company side.

Q.  Okay.  So that bonus would be -- so percent, if I'm doing the math, it's

A.  Roughly, yes.

Q.  How many years in a row have you hit that bonus or have you received a bonus like that?

A.  Well, I've -- I've -- I've received the bonus probably every year, at least for the last, say, ten years.  It's not always the target.  It can be either higher or it can be lower.

companies?

A.  Last time I checked like that.

Q.  Worth of stock?

A.  Yes,

Q.  Okay.  Do you receive stock options as part of your job?

A.  I receive stock grants.  I don't know if that's the same thing or not.

Q.  I don't either.

A.  That is -- that again is a -- it's a target, and it's based on my performance and the performance of the company.

Q.  Okay.  Would you agree that the performance of the company -- when you say performance of the company you mean how profitable the oompany is for any given year; is that correct?

A.  There is  and, again, I'm not real certain on these.  That is one of the metrics, you know, did -- did we hit our financial goals, and then there are some sort of brand share -- share goals that are associated with that, and this is across all of the RAI operating companies.

Q.  Okay.  Would you agree, sir, that if R.J. Reynolds or RAI had to pay out money in a lawsuit

it would decrease the profitability of the company potentially by whatever amount that payout would be?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS: Certainly in -- in the  in the big picture anything we had to pay out in a lawsuit would decrease the profitability of the company. I don't know if those metrics are included in that or if the litigation costs are in a different bucket.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Chris, what -- was your objection because it was compound because I asked RJR and RAI?  Because I'll go through and ask it all again but --

MR. KREINER:  It wasn't because it was compound.  It was more of a foundational because he's not an accountant or the CFO.

MR. PRYSOCK:  I understand.  Okay.

Dr. Garner, that's all the questions I have.  I appreciate your time today, sir.

EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT BY MR. KREINER:

Q.  Dr. Garner, good afternoon.  As you know, my name is Chris Kreiner.  I represent R.J. Reynolds in this litigation.  I want to start and get some background information about you and then ask you some questions along -- regarding the same topics that you've been asked today by Mr. Prysock, okay?

A.  Okay.

Q.  What is your -- remind us what your title is today at Reynolds American Services.

A.  Senior -- senior director regulatory oversight Reynolds American Services Company.

Q.  Okay.  And how does Reynolds American Services Company relate to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; how are those two entities related?

A.  Okay.  Reynolds American Services Company is within RAI and we do functions via service level agreements with the operating companies to do services that are common sort of across all the other operating companies.  My area in reg oversight, that would entail the submissions that we make to the FDA on an ongoing basis, hosting FDA inspections and other things.  There are other RAI

service company departments like human resources, the same situation. They provide human resources to all of the RAX tobacco operating companies.

Q.  And as part of your job with RAI Services have you provided services to R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

A.  Yes, I have.

Q.  Okay.  And in general, can you just give us a brief overview of what your job responsibilities are today in your current role?

A.  Sure.  Well, as you know, since 2009 we've been regulated by the FDA.  And as you might have inferred by the title, reg oversight is -- was created to make sure that we comply with all the requirements of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  So my job in particular have a little bit of input into some of the submission that we have to do for the FDA with respect to registration of products, registration of manufacturing sites, baseline ingredient documents that we have -- have disclosed to them as well as they -- they have the responsibility to -- every two years to inspect tobacco product manufacturers. They have inspected all of our manufacturing facilities.  I've been involved with those.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=154
Page 155

Occasionally I will go up to Washington and make presentations to the FDA about -- about our products or about some other topics that they have an interest in.  The FDA has also asked -- since they're relatively new to the -- to the tobacco area, they want to learn about how we manufacture our products, so they have asked for what they call site visits.  They're voluntary.  They are not required, but they have asked to come and visit our manufacturing plants and sort of have a tour of how we manufacture our products and the technologies that we use.  We hosted one of those in 2011, I believe, and we are currently on the docket to host two more site visits in 2013.

Q.     And for how long have you held your current position, approximately?

A.  Approximately I think I started February 2011.

Q.  Okay.

A.  So a little over two years.

Q.  Okay.  Now you told us you joined R.J. Reynolds in about 1995.  Can you tell us a little bit about your educational background and pre-Reynolds employment?

A.  Sure.

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=155
Page 156

Q.  Just if you could summarize that for us, please.

A.  Sure.  I -- I have a bachelor's in biology.  I have a master's in -- in environmental health, and 1 have a Ph.D. in pharmaceutical sciences which is focused in both the toxicology and the pharmacology route.  That's the educational experience.

Job experience prior to that from -- dates are rough, but from '79 to '83 I worked at the Michigan Cancer Foundation doing in vitro tests on certain types of carcinogens.  From 1983 to 1995 I worked at the General Motors research laboratories where I studied kind of two different topics.  One was basic tox studies on what comes out of the exhaust pipe of an automobile.  The other phase of it was related to sort of worker health and safety issues inside the plant, and then in 1995 I took this job with Reynolds and I've been here ever since.

Q.  Okay.  And your role at R.J. Reynolds from about 1995 to 2011 again just briefly -- I think you made reference to product stewardship, but if you could just summarize a little bit of what your career was at Reynolds during that time frame in

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=156
Page 157

terms of your responsibilities.

A.  Okay.  When I joined the company in 1995 I was an individual scientist.  My responsibilities had to do with issues related to the tobacco that we source, sort of setting standards for the tobaccos, and also I had some input on what was used in the manufacturing area.  With respect to, say, foods and other products there's something called Good Manufacturing Practices.  We started  as early as 1995 we started trying to understand the requirements of Good Manufacturing Practices for other products and tried to create a program that was very similar for tobacco products, and this was, you know, again, 20 years prior  almost 20 years prior to -- to the FDA.  So that was sort of how I started, and then with time I was given sort of more responsibility.  And I was given the opportunity to manage people and manage programs. And this -- I think early  early 2000s I became the head of the overall product stewardship program, which would include the subjects that I talked about earlier as well as subjects that we talked about earlier in this deposition with respect to the evaluation of the ingredients, evaluation of the papers, evaluation of tobaccos,

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=157
Page 158

et cetera, et cetera.  So basically I -- you know, I had oversight for what was used in manufacturing the tobaccos we purchased as well as the ingredients that were used in the products that we manufactured.

Q.  Okay.  And -- and with respect to product stewardship, what was the overall objective of Reynolds' product stewardship program during your tenure?

A.  Well, in -- in very simple terms, a cigarette carries with it risk; just the act of burning a' -- you know, burning an organic material such as tobacco and inhalation of that material carries with it a baseline level of risk, and we wanted to ensure -- and this is -- this is even --it predates me, but we want -- we -- you know, our view has always been to ensure that what we did to those products, different way of processing the tobacco, certain additives and ingredients that we would use, we don't want to increase that baseline level of risk.  That was sort of the fundamental tenet of the product stewardship program.

Q.  And before Reynolds would make any change to its commercial products that would actually be implemented into the market, would those changes be

212-279.9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=158
Page 159

subjected to the product stewardship program? A.  Yes, they would.

Q.  Okay.  And if Reynolds was evaluating a potential change and under product stewardship it had reason to believe that that change would actually increase the risk or have the potential to increase the risk of cigarette smoking, would that change be implemented?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Object to the form.

THE WITNESS:  No.

MR. KREINER:  What's the basis?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Leading.

BY MR. KREINER: Q.  Let me try again just in case.  If Reynolds evaluated a potential change and had reason to believe that that change would increase the risk or have the potential to increase risk, would the change be implemented?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Same objection.

you're going to provide, and does the expert report provide an overview of the topics that you would intend to testify if you were called at trial?

A.  I believe it does.

Q.  Okay.  And to the extent there's fact based testimony and opinion testimony, do you bring to bear your education, training and work experience to that -- to those opinions?

A.  I believe I do, yes.

Q.  And in addition, Mr. Prysock asked you about some documents that you reviewed, and there's reference to a reliance list.  You told us that you had done some work on RJRTdocs, got them from other sources like the library.  That list I think is over 1,000 documents; is that right?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Okay.  And are those the documents that you rely upon in addition to your education, training for purposes of your testimony in these cases?

A.  Yes, they are.

Q.     Okay.     If you could look at your disclosure.

MR.   KREINER:      Greg,   I   don't  think  we've marked one.     I  would like  --  can I mark  the

Brown &  Williamson's historical research programs including research and testing related to understanding and reducing the inherent risks of smoking; did I read that correctly?

A.  You did.

Q.  As part of the documents that are on your reliance list that you have provided in this case did you see documents that relate to those issues?

A.  Yes, I did.

Q.  Okay.  On Page 3 it says that Dr. --at the bottom, Dr. Garner will discuss the composition of cigarette smoke.  Are there documents on your reliance list relating to those topics  or that topic?

A.  Yes, there is.

Q.  Okay.  On Page 4 it says you'll testify about the research efforts of American and Brown & Williamson, that they were directed toward reducing or eliminating certain smoke constituents thought to be related to the risks of smoking.  As part of your review did you see documents relating to that issue?

A.  Yes, I did.

Q.     There's  reference  on  Page  5  to  topics known as  general  and selective  reduction.     As part

of your preparation did you see documents relating to the general and selective reduction of smoke constituents by American and Brown & Williamson?

A.  Yes, I did.

Q.  Doctor, were you asked to comment on the historical marketing practices of American, Brown & Williamson or R.J. Reynolds?

A.  Was 1 asked by Mr. Prysock?

Q.  As part of your testimony in this case did you look back at historical marketing or advertising efforts by American, Brown 6 Williamson or R.J. Reynolds?

A.  I did not.

Q.  You were asked some questions about consumer perception or consumer awareness.  Did you go back and look about -- in the historical records or historical information on consumer awareness or consumer perception?

A.  I did not.

Q.  Doctor, you were asked a number of questions as it relates to addiction and the risks of smoking.  As a toxicologist could you explain to us what the term risk means to you?

A.  Well, the -- the term risk means sort of increased probability for a particular endpoint.

So with respect to smoking I view risk as the risk, you know, of the development of lung cancer as related to cigarette smoking.  So from a toxicological perspective that was sort of my interpretation of the term risk.

Q.  With respect to addiction, can you -- so that the record is clear what is R.J. Reynolds1 position on whether cigarette smoking and nicotine in tobacco products is addictive?

A.  Our -- our view today as it is stated on our website is that nicotine and tobacco products are addictive based on the definition commonly applied today.

Q.  Okay.  And with respect to disease, what is Reynolds' position as to whether cigarette smoking is a cause of disease?

A.  Our position is cigarette smoking is a cause of disease.

Q.  And does Reynolds1 website have information about its position on whether -~ on whether people who are concerned about their risk should use tobacco products?

A.  And I think -- yes, and it's pretty clear.

Q.  And what is that position?

A.  The position is people that are concerned

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=164
Page 165

about their health that use tobacco products should quit.

Q.  And does Reynolds have a position that it states on its website about the benefits of quitting smoking as it relates to health?

A.  X believe it does.

Q.  And what's the position as to whether quitting is a good course of action?

A.  X believe it states that quitting is the best course of action.

Q.  You mentioned in response to one of your answers that one of the companies under RAX is something called Niconovum?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  What is Niconovum?

A.  Xt is a company that manufactures products that are called nicotine replacement therapy.  They are products that are used for people to quit smoking.  It's relatively new.  It's  we've --we've had them for a couple years now, and we have some products that are in limited markets.  They're in Des Moines, Iowa, X believe, and some of the surrounding communities in Des Moines.

Q.  And -~ and just generally what is the purpose or objective of nicotine replacement

therapy?

A,  Well, since -- since nicotine plays a role in why people smoke, overall theory is if you can get nicotine from another source then you won't have so many cravings for cigarettes and it will make it easier for people to quit smoking.

Q.  With respect to reasons that people smoke, and you've been asked about nicotine, but what --are there -- are there nonnicotine reasons that people smoke?

A.  The simple answer is yes.

Q.  What are -- what are some of those?

A.  Well, the more complicated answer is there's a lot of reasons why people smoke.  I don't think anybody understands them all.  Certainly some people -- for some people the presence of nicotine is very important from a physiological perspective. Some people report that it calms them down.  Some people report it helps them focus.  But clearly people don't smoke just for nicotine.  There are a number -- if you look in the literature there are a lot of things that are referred to as nonnicotinic factors, so it's -- it's much more complicated than people -- people smoke just for nicotine.

Q.  Okay.  Are taste and enjoyment also things

that people identify?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  Absolutely. BY MR. KREINER:

Q.  Are there other -- are there other reasons that people give besides -- for reasons that they smoke besides nicotine?

A.  People -- people like the taste.  People like the enjoyment.  People just like the ritual of smoking.

Q.  Doctor, let's -- let's look at some of the documents that Mr. Prysock showed you, and the first one is what's Plaintiff's MM 16.  Do you have that in front of you?

A.  Yes.

Q. Mr. Prysock represented to you, X believe, that this is from 1974. Do you see a date anywhere on this document?                     -

A.  I do not see a date on this document.

Q.  Do you see an author anywhere on this document?

A.  I do not see an author either.

Q.  Do you see whether this has actually been addressed to anyone?

A.  I --no, I do not.

Q.  Do you know if the statements contained in here were ever adopted or endorsed by Brown & Williamson?

A.  I do not.

Q.  You were asked --on Bates number page ends 0990 you were asked about the statement regarding regular cigarette smokers being nicotine dependent.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Does this document anywhere in there define what the unknown author means by nicotine dependent?

A.  I was not able to find anything.

Q.  Okay.  If you could turn to the first page, up under introduction.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  The second sentence says, this research was done under the direction of Kenyon and Eckhardt Advertising in early 1974.  Does that -~ what does that suggest to you as to whether Brown & Williamson actually did this research?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Object to the form. THE WITNESS:  It suggests that this was not their research.  This was research done by a third party.

BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  You can put that down.  Let's go to the next document Mr. Prysock asked you about, MM 339. Do you have that in front of you?

A.  I do.

Q.  Okay.  This is a December 1982 document. It has a signature line with Claude Teague; do you recall that?

A.  Yes, X do.

Q.  Okay.  Do you know if Dr. Teague was ever a vice president at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

A.  I don't believe he was.

Q.  Do you know if Dr. Teague was ever the vice president of research and development at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

A.  I don't believe he was.

Q.  Have you seen any documents to suggest that Claude Teague was ever in charge of product development at Reynolds in terms of its commercial cigarettes?

A.  My understanding is that Claude Teague was a chemist that was employed in R and D, but I don't think he ever had any  any responsibilities with relation to the development of brands or sales or marketing.

Q.  At the -- it's kind of hard to read, Doctor, but if you turn to the first page, at the very top above the date in the center of the page do you see there are some markings there?

A.  Yes.

Q.  I'll suggest to you that in other copies of this document it's a little clearer and it says draft.  If you'll just accept that for me.  Have you ever seen a final version of this document?

A.  I've never seen this document in any form.

Q.  Okay.  Do you know if this document actually was, in fact, sent to 6. R. Di Marco, a final version?

A.  I do not.

Q.  Has any lawyer or any plaintiff's lawyer in this litigation ever shown you a document where Dr. Di Marco says he agrees with Dr. Teague?

A.  No.

Q.  You were asked about -~ some questions about removing nicotine from tobacco and whether Reynolds could do that, and you mentioned some technical capabilities perhaps.  Let me just follow up.  Have there been historically cigarettes that have been on the market that have very, very low, virtually no nicotine in them?

A.  Yes, there have.

Q. And can -~ does an example come to mind that you could give us of a cigarette with very, very low levels of nicotine?

A.  I believe there was one called Next and I believe there was perhaps another one called Quest

Q.  And do you know when those cigarette products came out that had very low levels of nicotine, whether they were ever endorsed by the Surgeon General as being a less addictive cigarette?

A.  Time frame I'm a little fuzzy.  I want to say maybe mid"'80s to early '90s, and I don't believe they were ever endorsed by the Surgeon General as being a less -- less addictive or less risky product.

Q.  Okay.  Let me follow up on that.  Do you know if those cigarettes with very low levels of nicotine were ever endorsed by the Surgeon General as being less dangerous or less likely to cause disease?

A.  I have not seen anything to suggest that.

Q.  Today, is there any consensus or guidance as to what a nonaddictive cigarette would be? MR. PRYSOCK:  Object to the form.

MR. KREINER:  What's the basis? MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, first of all, it's leading; secondly, it's vague and ambiguous. MR. KREINER:  I disagree. BY MR. KREINER:

Q.  Go ahead.  If -- answer.

A.  Okay.  I think as I stated previously I --I have not seen any guidance, you know, going back to Surgeon General as far as what -- what would constitute some criteria for a less addictive cigarette, and currently with the FDA there has not been any guidance on what path you would have to go down to be able to produce a less addictive cigarette.

Q.  Okay.  Is there a test that Reynolds or any entity could run on a cigarette product that would tell you this cigarette is less addictive than that cigarette?

A.  No.

Q.  Cigarettes with very, very low levels of nicotine that you referenced in Next and Quest, how did they do in the marketplace?

A.  Fairly poorly.

Q.  And did those -- I think you were asked some questions as to whether those cigarettes would

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=172
Page 173

be less risky and you said no.  Can you provide for us the basis for your opinion in that regard?

A.  Sure.  I mean, what -~ what is responsible for causing smoking-related disease is a chemical or a combination of chemicals that are produced during the pyrolysis of the tobacco.  Whether you have -~ and the nicotine level does not weigh into that equation at all.  It's essentially the burning of tobacco and the creation of these by-products from the combustion that are thought to cause smoking-related disease.  So in many of the Surgeon General's reports when they -~ when they speculated on what these chemicals might be I've never seen any evidence that anybody thinks that nicotine plays a role in the causality of smoking-related disease.

Q.  The cigarettes with very low levels of nicotine, do they -~ does the smoke of those contain carcinogens and other toxins?

A.  Yes.

Q.     Doctor,   you don't have  to get it in front of you,   but you were also  shown Exhibit MM 174, which was  a  letter  from about 1963  about Brown  & Williamson  and  information  to  the  Surgeon General's Advisory  Committee.

A.  Yes,

Q.  Do you remember that?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  Okay.  Regardless of -- of how -- how things -- whatever came of this memo or the follow-up, what did the Surgeon General's report conclude in 1964 with respect to whether smoking caused lung cancer?

A.  1964 the Surgeon General concluded that smoking caused lung cancer in men.

Q.  Okay.  Okay.  Doctor, could you get MM 304 that Mr. Prysock showed you?

A.  Yes.

Q.  This is the 1978 memo future consumer reaction to nicotine.

A.  Oh-huh.

Q.  Is that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And as part of the -- your review looking into the historical efforts that we talked about from your -- that are in your expert report did you come across any scientist named H. D. Steele?

A.  I did not.

Q.     Did you  come  across  any  scientist named M.   J.   McCue?

A.  I did not.

Q.  Do you know whether those folks were in the research department or not?

A.  I've never heard those names previously. I don't know where they -- where they worked.

Q.  Okay.  Do you know what their job responsibilities were at Brown & Williamson?

A.  I do not.

Q.  Do you know if the statements contained within this document were shared with anyone in upper management at Brown & Williamson?

A.  I do not.

Q.  Do you know if anyone at Brown & Williamson adopted the statements that are set forth by H. D. Steele?

A.  I do not.

Q.  Okay.  There was a reference to nicotine being a poison.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  As a toxicologist what does it mean for something to be a poison?

A.  Being a poison in simple terms means it has the potential to cause an -- some type of an adverse -- adverse effect if the dose is high enough.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY 212-279-9424                                   www.veritext.com                                  212-490-3430pgNbr=175

Q.  Okay.  And in cigarette smoking would nicotine be considered a poison --

A.  No.

Q.  -- at  the levels in smoke?

A.  Hot at levels in smoke, no.

Q.  Is there something known as a dose response effect in toxicology?

A.  Yes, there is.

Q. How does the dose response effect relate to this issue of whether something is a poison or is not a poison?

A.  Well, obviously as -- you know, you  if you're testing a particular chemical in some kind of a toxicological test you do what is called a dose response, and you start at a low dose and you continue to increase the dose until you see a response.  That's what a dose response is.

Now, the levels of nicotine that a smoker would be exposed to in using a tobacco product are at the very low end of that, and it's not until very high levels that you would get any kind of a poison type of outcome from nicotine.

Q.  Okay.  As part of your review of documents and interactions with the company that -- that you've been with since 1995 do you know or have you

seen any evidence that Brown & Williamson or American or R.J. Reynolds adopted the position that nicotine as it's in cigarette smoke is a poison?

A.  No.

Q.  If you could pick up MM 224.  Okay.  You were read a statement from the second page of this which said in most cases, however, the smoker of a filtered cigarette was getting as much or more nicotine and tar as he would have gotten from a regular cigarette.  Do you recall being asked about that statement?

A.  Yes.

Q.  I believe you disagreed with that statement.  Can you tell us the basis of your opinion in that regard?

A.  And just to be clear, a filtered cigarette compared to a regular cigarette, that means a nonfiltered cigarette.

Q.  Okay.

A.  I think",y.Qu. know, clearly when you measure -- when you measure the tar in a nonfiltered cigarette versus using a standardized test, and then the tar in a filtered cigarette the levels of tar in a filtered cigarette are significantly less, you know, 50 percent, maybe up

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=177
Page 178

to 70 or 80 percent less than in a nonfiltered cigarette.  That's pretty clear.  And then the other part is when you look at the epidemiology of nonfiltered cigarettes to filter cigarettes the risk for, say, lung cancer will -- will decrease. So both from a -~ what's present in the smoke as well as what the outcome is to the smoker that's --that was my basis for disagreement with that statement.

Q.  If the smoker of a nonfiltered cigarette is getting the same exposure as a filtered cigarette, what would their risk of lung cancer be?

A.  It would be the same.

Q.  Okay.  And what does the epidemiology show with respect to whether smokers of filtered cigarettes have higher or lower risk of lung cancer than smoker of a nonfiltered cigarette?

A.  The risk for lung cancer for filtered cigarettes is less than for nonfiltered cigarettes.

Q.  And what does it suggest to you as to whether smokers of filtered cigarettes are getting exposed to less or more smoke than smokers of nonfiltered cigarettes?

A.  It suggests to me that they're being exposed to less.

Q.  You were asked one or two questions about whether Reynolds used ammonia in some of Its cigarettes --

A.  That's correct.

Q.  --in cigarettes?  Does Reynolds add ammonia to all its cigarettes?

A.  No.

Q.  Are you aware of the Surgeon General ever taking the position that cigarettes with added ammonia are more dangerous than cigarettes without added ammonia?

A.  I am not aware of that.

Q.  Is ammonia present in tobacco -- in tobacco smoke naturally?

A.  Yes, it is.

Q.  You were asked about Levulinlc acid. Would Levulinic acid have been subjected to the product stewardship analysis that you mentioned earlier?

you had some discussion with Mr. Prysock about statistics and risk factor versus causation and causal mechanisms, and so I want to just follow up in that regard, but first let me read to you from Page 111, Lines 19.

Question:  Mr. Heimann, cigarette smoking is clearly a marker involved in lung cancer; is that correct?

Answer:  I think in the statistical sense I would have to agree with that.

Question:  And the truth is you now agree that smoking is associated with lung cancer, correct?

Answer:  I now agree? Question:  Yes.

Answer:  I agreed 25 years ago that it was associated statistically, yes.

Did I read that accurately? A.  Yes, you did.

Q.  How does that testimony relate to what you were being asked earlier with respect to statistical association versus causal mechanisms?

A.  I think it  I think it ties in very tightly with what I was trying to explain.  I think what Mr. Heimann was saying in the previous passage

212-279-9424

212-490-3430pgNbr=181

was that what he disagreed with the Surgeon General was the evidence that was required to demonstrate that there was a causal relationship, but I think in ~~ in this passage it clearly states that he is -- he is clearly making an acknowledgment of the epidemiology of the statistical association of increased risk in, you know, smokers.  But his --his disagreement was more with the ~- the fact that he didn't believe cause had been proven from a scientific standpoint.

Q.  Okay.  And with respect to cause from a scientific standpoint, I believe you made reference to an animal model, a mechanism and the specific agent that's responsible.

A.  Correct.

Q.  Are you as a toxicologist familiar with a concept known as what today would be called a classical view of causation?

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  What's the classical view of causation?

A.  Well, the classical view of causation would include all of those things that we previously talked about.  Since -- since epidemiology is sort of a mathematical science, it's -- it's about statistics, and it shows is

there a relationship between X and Y.  From a --from a -- from a purely scientific in an experimental standpoint there are some things that are necessary to be able to prove causation, and those are the things,that I laid out for you previously, the agent, the mechanism and the animal model.

Q.  And you referred earlier that one of the areas of your testimony would be efforts by American and Brown &  Williamson to try to reduce the risk of smoking, correct?

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  As companies trying to engage in that effort, are answers to questions about a mechanism and having an animal model and knowing the specific agent, would that be important?

A.  It would be very important.

Q.  Why is that?

A.  Well, because in -- in order to develop a product that was less risky, you would have to know what to modify in the previous product to be able to get down to that level.  So that's where the agent comes into play.  Secondly, you need to be able to test that in some kind of a system so you could compare product A versus product B.  In that

212-490-3430pgNbr=183
Page 184

case an animal model would be very important, and if the mechanism was identified perhaps you could have some type of an in vitro test, sort of nonanimal, a cell test or a -- you know, a test in -- in an enzyme system so you could use that to predict whether this -- this new product would be less risky than the old product.  So all three of those are very important in the development of a reduced risk product.

Q.  And that -- and those questions and those issues, how did they tie in with the position that American and Brown & Williamson historically had as to whether cigarette smoking was a proven cause of disease?

A.  Well, I think their view was that those were very important from a scientific perspective and those had not been fully satisfied to the level that would be necessary to demonstrate cause.  But as Mr. Heimann said in his testimony, he -- he --apparently for 25 years previously he -- he had acknowledged that smoking was a risk factor based on the epidemiology.

Q.  And Mr. Heimann made some statements about whether he agreed with the Surgeon General's conclusions on cause.

A.  Correct.

Q.  Despite Mr. Heimann's testimony, what had American Tobacco put on the sides of its packs of its cigarettes since 1966?

A.  Well, there have been warning labels, you know, again on the pack since 1966.  They were changed in I believe '69, and they were changed again mid-'80s to the current form that we have today.

Q.  And are you aware of any instance since 1966 where American or Brown & Williamson didn't comply with the federal law to affix warning labels on the sides of its packages it sells here in the United States?

A.  I am not.

MR. KREINER:  Do you have the Businessweek (sic) on Camel Crush?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yeah, that's actually the  don't let me take that. BY MR. KREINER:

Q.  Doctor, we -- we only have one copy of Plaintiff's Exhibit 1.  This is the article from Business Insider, and I just want to follow up.  If you could  well, first of all, had you ever seen this article before?

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=185
Page 186

A.  No.

Q.  Let me show you the last statement on this, and let me read it to you and then I'll give it to you.  The last statement on this article says, this note in no way advocates cigarette use among underage individuals, as both we and the manufacturers strongly oppose underage cigarette consumption.

Let me ask if 1 read that correctly?

A.  Yeah, I believe you read it correctly.

Q.  Okay.  And focusing in on R.J. Reynolds, because this is a 2012 document, what is your understanding as to the company's view as to whether underage people should smoke?

A.  I think our view is very clear.  We don't want people under the age of 21 to start smoking.

Q.  Okay.  And you've been with the company since 1995.  What has the company's position been that you have observed in your time with the company with respect to that issue?

A.  It's been very consistent to what it is today.

Q.  You were asked some questions about whether Reynolds' growth brands are intended to get new smokers.  Let me be very clear.  What is

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=186
Page 187

Reynolds' position as to whether nonsmokers should start smoking?

A.  Our view is nonsmokers should not start smoking.

Q.  And in your experience having been with the company since 1995, have you observed or seen any efforts by R.J. Reynolds to try to convince nonsmokers to start smoking?

A.  I have not.

Q.  And have you ever been in any meetings where any of your colleagues has suggested that nonsmokers  that Reynolds' efforts should be to convince nonsmokers to start smoking?

A.  I have not.

Q.  Are you familiar with -- you referenced two programs.  I just want to follow up briefly with respect to youth smoking.  You made reference to the We Card Program.  What's the We Card Program?

A.  The We Card Program is a  is a program that Reynolds is in with tobacco  tobacco stores and other types of retailers that sell tobacco products, and it's about making sure that when somebody walks into the store to buy a tobacco product that they are carded, they are asked to

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=187
Page 188

provide identification to demonstrate that they are of legal age of smoking in that particular state.

Q.     Okay.  And you also made reference to something called Right Decisions Right Now.  What is Right Decisions Right Now?

A.  That is an informational program that Reynolds sponsors, and that goes out to X believe it's students that are in middle school to talk about the dangers and the risks of smoking and let them know that they should not smoke and, you know, smoking is something that  that is an adult decision, and it fully informs them of the risks of using tobacco products.

Q.  And for how long has  approximately has Reynolds sponsored both Right Decisions Right Now and the We Card Program?

A.  I believe they  I believe they started sometime in the '90s.  I believe they've been in place during my full tenure with the company, which was '95.

Q.  The last topic I want to just follow up on, you were -~ and we made reference earlier to Niconovum and made reference to the Reynolds' position on its website that the best course of action for people concerned about their health is

212-279-9424

212-490-3430pgNbr=188
Page 189

to quit.  Are you familiar with something at Reynolds known as the migration strategy?

A.  I am.

Q.  What is the migration strategy?

A.  Well, the migration strategy is -- is fairly simple.  I'll try to do my best to explain it, but, you know, obviously the best course of action for people that smoke is to quit.  But for people that like tobacco and they -- and they --and they like to use tobacco, it's fairly clear that there are differing levels of risk based on the tobacco product that you choose to use, cigarettes being fairly high up on the -- on that risk line.  Other products we make, like Snus for example, which is an oral tobacco product.  It's been used in Sweden for decades.  The outcome has been fairly -- fairly phenomenal.  Smoking rates have decreased.  Rates of lung cancer have decreased, and Snus use has gone up.  So the strategy is to migrate or move people from cigarettes to other forms of tobacco that are --that are less risky.

Q.  Okay.  And in addition to Snus are there other products that are less harmful than cigarettes that are also within the Reynolds

212-279-9424

212-490-3430pgNbr=189
Page 190

companies?

A.  Well, certainly most of the -- most of the oral tobacco products are less risky.  We also have a heat not burn product that's -- that's called Eclipse, came out in the 1990s.  The premise for that is it contains tobacco.  It heats the tobacco, but it doesn't burn the tobacco.  So you aren't creating the chemicals that you create during the pyrolysis -- pyrolysis of tobacco in a cigarette. And all of the tests that we ran during our qualification of those products during product stewardship it shows that there is a significant reduction in chemistry.  It shows there's a significant reduction in the biological activity in in vitro systems, which are cell ~~ cell systems. There's reduced activity in animal models, and in clinical studies where people switched from tobacco-burning cigarettes to tobacco-heating cigarettes there was a reduction of the biomarkers of exposure and biomarkers of harm.  So from a --from an overall risk perspective those clearly feel to me like they're a much -- much less risky product than a conventional cigarette.

MR. KREINER:  Those are all the questions I have for you, Doctor.

EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR THE PLAINTIFF BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  Dr. Garner, you were asked some questions or discussed the FDA --

A.  Yes, sir.

Q.  --in your  the FDA has the ability to oversee tobacco products now, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  That is a very recent development, isn't it?

A.  2009.

Q.     And you mentioned that  --   I   think you used the  word voluntary.     You  have voluntary  site inspections   for  the  FDA  at RJR  now?

A.     There's   --  there  are  two  different categories.     There  is   the  --   there's   the  FDA  --

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=191
Page 192

there's the FDA inspection, which is nonvoluntary. That's something that they -- they are required to do every two years.  They visit a facility that manufactures tobacco products and they do an evaluation of -- of that facility.  That's not voluntary.  What -- the voluntary piece I think that's more --- I think I termed that as site tour where they would say, you know, they --we have some people that are new.  We want to get them an opportunity to understand how -- how your tobacco products are made.  Would you be willing to host a group of staffers from the PDA and show them how you manufacture your products and -- and some of the processes that you have in place.  And I believe I said we hosted one group in 2011.  They contacted me in the spring of this year.  They said they -- they want to have -- they want to send some more people out to have a tour.  I said, whenever you're ready, I got a program ready for you.  Just let me know when you want to send them.

Q.  So this voluntary action by RJR has happened once so far?

A.  Correct.

Q.      RJR didn't  voluntarily  accept  PDA oversight,   did it?

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=192
Page 193

A.  I -- well, I think our -- I think our view as stated in the past was we -- we would welcome reasonable regulation.

Q.  Sir, the question was:  RJR didn't voluntarily accept FDA oversight, did it?

A.  I don't know what you mean by voluntary. Q.  Well 

A. I mean, we didn't have a choice. FDA was granted the authority over tobacco products, so it really wasn't voluntary in any sense.

Q.  RJR publicly spoke out against FDA regulating tobacco products, didn't it?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I'm not aware of that.  Do you have --do you have a document or something that says that?

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Yes, sir, we do.  I'm asking you do you know that as a  as someone who is working at RJR and has been for some time?  You don't know that RJR fought FDA regulation, in fact, filed a lawsuit against FDA regulation?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I don't think the lawsuit was against FDA regulation in total.  I think

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=193

some of the lawsuits we filed were against some specific components of FDA regulation. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  Okay.

A.  If I'm not mistaken.

Q.  Can we agree, sir, that R.J. Reynolds filed several lawsuits against components of FDA regulation?

A.  Yes.,  Yes, we can agree on that.

Q.  Okay.  You were asked questions about certain people at -- in these -- some of these exhibits that we showed you and if you knew if that person was a scientist or what position.  You just don't know one way or another what positions those people held, do you?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Okay.  You were asked questions about tar and nicotine levels, and I believe you said that tar and nicotine levels are reduced in filtered cigarettes; is that correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  That's according to the testing machine, the Cambridge testing machine or the FTC testing machine, correct?

A.  Correct.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=194
Page 195

Q. But that's not according -- that's not an actual statement as to whether a smoker is getting decreased levels of tar and nicotine, is it?

A, Well, again, that's -- you are -- you are correct. That is as measured on a -- on a ~- on a machine.

Q.  And, in fact, that machine is not --

MR. KREINER:  He wasn't done.  He wasn't done.

THE WITNESS:  But I think the  the link back to the epidemiology that was done in nonfiltered smokers versus filtered smokers and the reduced risk for lung cancer would certainly to me as a scientist would -- would suggest that those people are being exposed to lower levels of tar. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  But the tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds, are not allowed to use the FTC testing machine method anymore, are they? A.  That's correct.

Q.  In fact, one of the heads of the FTC called the tobacco companies' use of that testing machine a shameful practice, didn't they?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.

THE WITNESS:  I'm  I'm not aware of that.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.  And I just want to be clear on the record.  You're saying that a filter attached to a conventional cigarette decreases the risk of disease in a smoker?

A.  Based on the epidemiology I think that's pretty clear, yes.

Q.  So you're saying filtered cigarettes are safer?

A,  I'm saying filtered cigarettes reduce the risk for lung cancer,

Q.  So you're saying filtered cigarettes are safer than nonfiltered cigarettes?

MR. KREINER:  Objection, asked and answered.

THE WITNESS:  I think I stated my answer. I'm saying if you look at the epidemiology they clearly demonstrate that the -- that the risk of lung cancer in a filtered cigarette is less than that in a nonfiltered cigarette. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Yes or no, are filtered cigarettes safer than nonfiltered cigarettes?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form, asked and answered.  It's now argumentative.  He's given his answer.

THE WITNESS:  I've  you can ask all afternoon.  I'm going to answer it the same way.

BY MR, PRYSOCK: Q.  Sir, I will ask all afternoon if you don't answer the question yes or no.  You can explain it, and I'll give you every opportunity to explain your answer.  My question to you is, yes or no, are filtered cigarettes safer than nonfiltered cigarettes?

MR. KREINER:  I object to the lecture as being inappropriate.  It's been asked and answered.  It's argumentative.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  What's your definition of safer?  Is your definition does it -- does it present less risk to a smoker if you put a filter on a cigarette, then my answer is yes. But until you give me a definition of what you mean by safer, then I can't answer it yes or no.

BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  My definition of safer is based upon what

you said earlier, decreases the risk of disease. So my question to you just to clarify ~-

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  -- yes or no, is a filtered cigarette safer for a smoker than a nonfiltered cigarette? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  Based on the definition that you just read I'm going to say yes. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  You talked about  or you've referred several times to the RJR website.

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  And that's how you inform consumers I think you said about the risks of smoking?

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Yes?

A.  Yes, I'm sorry.

Q.  That's all right.  And also you said that's how you inform consumers that they should quit smoking if they're concerned about the risks, right?

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Yes?

A.  Yes.  Sorry.

Q.  That's all right.  I understand.  It's -~ how long has RJR had that website where they inform customers that if they're concerned about the risks of smoking they should quit smoking?

A.  I don't have an exact date.  I'm guessing probably sometime in the '90s.

Q.  Is it '90s or closer to 2000?

A.  I would say late '90s, early 2000 is a reasonable time frame.

Q.  Okay.  The same question about the risks of smoking, how long has RJR had that public position on its website about the risks of smoking in causing disease like COPD and lung cancer?

A.  Probably the same answer.

Q.  Prior to that time R.J. Reynolds did not tell its customers that if they're concerned about the risks of smoking they should quit, did they? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I'm  I'm not aware of all the public statements that they've made. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  Are you aware of any public statement where RJR took the position or told its customers rather that if they are concerned about the risks of smoking they should quit smoking prior to when

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=199
Page 200

that website came out in the late '90s or early 2000s?

A.  I'm  I'm not aware of that.  I'm not aware of any, no.

Q.  You talked about Niconovum, and that's not a smokeable product, is it?

A.  No.

Q.  All right.  It's a  well, describe what it is.

A.  It's  it's a lozenge, so you put it in your mouth.

Q.  And it releases nicotine, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Now you told me before that nicotine is in cigarettes or part of the -- the -- part of the reaction of nicotine in cigarettes is for sensory perception or something like that; is that ~- is that accurate?

A.  That's close, yes.

Q.     Okay.     And that's  in the  smoking of the nicotine,   correct?

A.     The   the nicotine in the smoke is one of the  aspects   of  the  sensory properties  of  oigarette smoke.

Q.     And the nicotine  in  cigarette  smoke  causes

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=200
Page 201

certain reactions in the brain, certain chemical reactions where there's a release of dopamine, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  All right.  There's no sensory perception issue in using Niconovum, is there?

A.  I don't believe so.  It's an oral product.

Q.  Right.

A.  So it would get into the bloodstream, but you don't have the ritual of smoking that you would have if you smoked a cigarette.

Q.  And the nicotine in Niconovum does not have a taste, does it?

A.  I don't believe it does, no.

Q.  So you -- you said before I believe that nicotine was not physically addictive in your opinion, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.     Why would people switch over from cigarette smoking to Niconovum and get tasteless nicotine if they weren't physically addicted to nicotine?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form.  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  What I said is  and I'm

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=201
Page 202

going to clarify that statement as well, but what I said is it is not physically addictive like other drugs that were classically known as addictive drugs, which means they don't have --you aren't -- you aren't physically -- you aren't physically addicted to that drug.  With heroin, if you stop using heroin, you get physically ill.  Your body needs heroin to function normally.  With -- with nicotine you smoke or you use an oral tobacco product, the nicotine gets into your bloodstream.  There is some physiology that happens at the brain, but you don't become physically addictive. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  Okay.

A.  Does that make any sense? Q.  I -- yes, sir.  You're saying that nicotine is not --in cigarette smoke is not physically addictive? A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Okay.  So why would someone switch from cigarette smoking to Niconovum if they weren't physically addicted?

A.  Well, because the -- the physiological response that they get in their brain from nicotine

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=202
Page 203

would be similar from smoking to a NRT product to an oral tobacco product.

Q.  Is there any other substance in cigarettes that makes them addictive besides nicotine?

A.  There was some language in one of the SGRs that there -- there may be others, but I don't think they have been certainly -- they -- they haven't been studied or identified to the extent that nicotine has.  But, you know, again I think what I talked about previously is there are other factors about smoking that 1 referred to as sort of the nonnicotinic factors.  There is something about the act of smoking itself that I think people find enjoyable and pleasurable.  So it's -- it's not just the nicotine.  The nicotine is a component of it, but it's not just nicotine.

Q.  What else is it that makes cigarettes addictive?  What other ingredients are in cigarettes that make them addictive?

A.  Again, I don't think -- I don't think people -- I don't think the individual chemicals have been studied to that effect.  I think it's just the physical act of smoking, drawing on a cigarette, the inhalation of smoke into your lungs, that I think is the pleasurable aspect that people

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=203
Page 204

find from smoking.

Q.  Okay.  So you think just that pleasurable aspect makes it addictive?

A.  I think it's a combination of the nicotine and its -- its physiology as well as the pleasurable aspect of smoking.

Q.  Would you agree with me that nicotine is the -- overwhelmingly the main reason why cigarettes can be addictive?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  And if you don't like overwhelmingly I can take it out.  Would you agree with me that the nicotine in cigarettes is the primary reason that cigarettes are addictive?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I would say it's  it's a ~- it's a key reason.  It's a -- it's a primary reason.  I don't know if it's overwhelmingly why people smoke. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I took that part out. A.  Okay.

Q.  So would you agree with me that nicotine is a key or primary reason why cigarettes can be

addictive?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  For  for some people I would say absolutely yes. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  Okay.  But you don't know if taking the nicotine out of cigarettes would reduce the addictiveness of cigarettes?

A.  Well, you know, again, I  I --' would it reduce the addictiveness of cigarettes?  For  for some people maybe.  But, you know, again as -- as we talked about earlier, the criteria for what would be required to make a less addictive cigarette are -- are not -- are not known.  They are not clear.  There's not been any guidance offered by the Surgeon General nor has there been any guidance offered by the FDA.  I mean, why --why people smoke is very complex.

Q.  Did you say that -- and I may have heard you wrong, but did you say that Reynolds' position is that nonsmokers should not start smoking?

*.  x e s .

Q.      How  long  has   it been  Reynolds'   position that  nonsmokers   should not  start  smoking cigarettes?

A.  I -- I can't answer that. Q.  Is it recent?

A.  Well, I mean, I think -- yeah, I think it's ~- I think it's relatively recent.  I don't ~-1 don't have a date for that one.

Q.  So if -- if people adopt this position, Reynolds acknowledges that it will no longer have any cigarette-smoking customers as soon as the current batch of smokers die, correct?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS:  I don't know if it's  I don't know if it's -- it's what they will acknowledge.  I mean, if -- if -- people are still going to be smoking other brands and we want them to smoke our brands. BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  I'm not talking about that.  I'm talking about --

A.  But clearly, I mean, I think smoking rates are going down.  The percentage of people that smoke in the United States has gone down since I started with the company, and it's probably been going down for decades.  So it's -- it's understood that the number of smokers in this country is -- is decreasing and is going to continue to decrease

into the future.

Q.  Other than this deposition today where has anyone at Reynolds publicly said that they don't want nonsmokers to start smoking?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form. THE WITNESS:  I believe it's on our website.

BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q.  So if I go to the website today I could find something that says nonsmokers should not start smoking on RJR's website?

A.  I believe it's there.

Q.  You talked about a migration strategy. And I understand you're shifting people from one product that contains nicotine cigarettes to another product that contains nicotine, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And you said that the risk from some of those other products is less for developing disease than it is with cigarette smoking, correct?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  And that's the purpose of the migration strategy?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  Do you believe that's a good strategy for

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=207
Page 208

R.J. Reynolds to have because it reduces the risk of disease to its customers?

A.  I believe it's a good strategy to have, yes, because it reduces the risk of disease, not only to our customers but to any -- any people --anybody that uses tobacco products.

Q.  These other tobacco products that you're talking about migrating customers to though, they still have risk of developing serious and fatal diseases, don't they?

A.  Yeah.  I mean, Snus, for example, you know, we can talk about that.  There is still some risk with Snus.  It's not a -- it's not a safe or zero-risk product, but I think, you know, there are documents in the literature from scientists working in public health that have estimated that the risk for people migrating from smoking to Snus is 95 percent less than for smoking.  So it's not zero, but it certainly is quite low in comparison to smoking.

Q.  And that's good except for the people who still get the oral cancers, correct?

A.  Well, again, there is that 5 percent that are still at risk --

Q,  Right.

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=208
Page 209

A.  ~- clearly, but I think a 95 percent

decrease in risk is fairly significant.

Q.  If R.J. Reynolds is concerned about its

customers developing diseases, why doesn't it just

migrate them away from products that contain

nicotine completely that don't have a risk of

disease?

MR. KRE1NER:  Objection to the form.

THE WITNESS:  Well, we are a tobacco

product manufacturer.  Tobacco contains

nicotine, and that's pretty much the story.  I

mean, the products we -- the products we make

sort of across the risk spectrum are tobacco

products and inherent to that is nicotine.

MR. PRYSOCK:  That's all the questions I

have.  Thanks.

EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR THE DEFENDANT BY MR. KREINER: Q.  Doctor, I just want to follow up briefly on -- you were asked some questions about lawsuits over FDA regulation.  I just want to follow up.  Do you recall the nature of any of the lawsuits that have been filed?

A.  Yeah, I recall a couple of them.

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=209
Page 210

Q. Okay. Let's start with -- why don't we do them one at a time. What's -- give me one that you recall.

A.  Okay.  One was a lawsuit with respect to the graphic health warnings.

Q.  Okay.  With respect to the lawsuit over the graphic health warnings, did that lawsuit seek to prohibit FDA regulation over tobacco products generally?

A.  No.

Q.  Did it seek to invalidate the requirements that R.J. Reynolds provide information to the FDA about its products?

A.  No.

Q.  Did that lawsuit seek to overturn FDA's authority to inspect R.J. Reynolds' facilities?

A.  No.

Q.  Did that lawsuit seek to overturn the FDA's right to regulate the manufacture of Reynolds' cigarettes?

A.  No.

Q.  What was the nature of the lawsuit over the graphic health warnings?

A.  Well, the nature -- the nature of the lawsuit I think there's two areas that were focused

212-279-9.424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com .

212-490-3430pgNbr=210
Page 211

on.  The first one I'm not incredibly clear about, but it has to do with the -- the -- the nature of the image was not factual.  I think that was a legal sort of definition that I don't understand. The second part of it was pretty clear.  As -- as part of the FDA's efforts to include graphic health warnings on cigarette packs they did a study to --to study what would be the impact of the message to tobacco users, and the result of the study was that it would have no impact whatsoever.  So X think those -- those were the two key tenets of the lawsuit that I recall as I sit here today.

Q.  And do you know if there's been a decision in that lawsuit?

A.  Well, I think there was a lawsuit brought at a court level.  The judge sided with R.J, Reynolds, and I think there were other companies that were party to the lawsuit as well.  The FDA made an appeal of that decision to a higher court. The higher court, they  they also agreed with the position of the lower court, and I believe after that the FDA decided not to appeal that decision to the supreme court.  So my understanding is that that -- that issue is -- is done and the FDA is kind of going back to determine what other types of

212-279-9424

VERITBXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=211
Page 212

messaging might actually have -- have impact to a tobacco user.

Q.  You -- that's one lawsuit.  Are you familiar with another lawsuit about the composition of the Tobacco Product Scientific Advisory Committee?

A.  Yes, I am.

Q.  Okay.  What's the nature of that lawsuit?

A.  Well, the -- you know, again, there's --there were two issues, the -- the -~ the TPSAC as it's called is -- you know, in theory that should be some outside scientific experts that the FDA brings in to do various studies and various projects.  By virtue of that they got to see some of our confidential brand information, you know, essentially everything that's in our products.  A couple of problems with that from our perspective, first of all, there were several of those individuals that also had other jobs consulting for, say, a pharmaceutical company.  And if -- so that would be a conflict of interest, for example, if  if we were developing products that we wanted to use to either migrate people or to have them quit smoking, they would have access to our confidential business information.  That didn't

212-279-9424

VERITEXT REPORTING COMPANY www.veritext.com

212-490-3430pgNbr=212
Page 213

really feel that appropriate.  The other thing is there are a number of them that testify for plaintiffs in lawsuits much like this, and so by virtue of their -- their role in the TPSAC they would have access to, again, our confidential business information.

Q.  And prior to filing the lawsuit over the -- the TPSAC, did Reynolds contact the FDA to try to work this issue out without having to file a lawsuit?

A.  Yes, we did.

Q.  And how did the FDA respond?

A.  1 don't recall if they responded at all, but in any event, they did not make any changes.

Q.  And as I asked you earlier, did this lawsuit seek in any way to overturn FDA regulation generally or the disclosure requirements or the other requirements that are under R.J. Reynolds?

A.  No, it had no -- no -- no overall impact into the control of FDA over the regulation of tobacco products except for those two specific situations.

Q.  Okay.

MR. KREINER:  Those are all my questions.

EXAMINATION BY COUNSEL FOR THE PLAINTIFF BY MR. PRYSOCK: Q.  How did that lawsuit turn out against those guys on TPSAC?

A.  I -- I don't know.  I mean, I know -- I know some of the Individuals are no longer on TPSAC, so I don't know whether that actually went to trial or the FDA just made a decision to sort of reconfigure the TPSAC to Include people that don't fall In that category.

Q.  Or neither of those?

A.  Or something else, yeah.

Q.  Okay.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Doctor, you have the opportunity to read or waive.

Dr. Garner's curriculum vitae.   In addition to his responsibilities at Reynolds, Dr. Gamer has authored or co-authored more than 50 scientific papers and presentations.

Subject Matter of Expert Testimony

Dr. Garner will testify that Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco followed and contributed to the body of publicly available literature on smoking and health as it developed, worked to understand the relationship between smoke constituents and the health impact of smoking, evaluated and developed chemical and biological tools to measure the contents of smoke and the health effects of smoking and changes to cigarette design that could reduce the health impact of smoking. Dr, Garner will testify that through research spanning many decades, American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson actively engaged in fundamental research to identify and quantify the constituents in cigarette smoke. He will testify that American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson followed the publicly available scientific literature on smoking and health. He will also discuss how American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson attempted to reduce or eliminate certain constituents in smoke. In addition, Dr, Garner will testify about the reduction in tar and nicotine deliveries of commercially available cigarettes from the late 1950s to the present and that Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco provided their customers with a variety of products across a wide range of standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields.

Dr, Garner will discuss the composition of cigarette smoke. More specifically, he will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol comprised of over 5,000 different chemical constituents. He will describe that most of these chemicals are formed during the pyrolysis of tobacco. He will also testify that approximately 60 of these compounds have been identified as being carcinogenic by one or more different government or public health groups. Dr. Garner

3pgNbr=255
will further testify that American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson accomplished significant reductions in the yields of these carcinogens and toxicants in the smoke of their cigarettes through the implementation of various technologies. More specifically, Dr. Gamer will testify that for decades, American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson engaged in significant research to test and evaluate cigarette smoke, identify and quantify smoke constituents, reduce or eliminate certain smoke constituents, conduct or fund internal and external biological and chemical testing of cigarettes and their smoke, and work toward developing commercially viable reduced risk cigarettes.

Dr. Garner will testify that the research efforts of American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson were directed toward reducing or eliminating certain smoke constituents thought to be related to the risks of smoking. He will generally discuss the different types of products developed, tested or introduced into the marketplace by American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson that achieved technical success in reducing standardized machine generated smoke constituent yields but were not consumer acceptable, including carbon-filtered cigarettes, low nicotine yield cigarettes, and tobacco heating cigarettes.

Dr. Garner will describe Reynolds* product stewardship program and its history and the current processes in place to ensure that new tobacco products or changes to existing tobacco products do not increase the inherent risks associated with tobacco use. He will also describe similar efforts employed by American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson to accomplish the same result. He will also talk about the work done by Reynolds to develop new animal models and other predictive tests to assess the comparative toxicity of tobacco products for use in product stewardship.

4pgNbr=256
Dr. Garner will explain the reasons behind the development of lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes. First, he will explain that guidanoe from the scientific and public health community and government authorities suggested that cigarette manufacturers develop lower "tar" and nicotine yield cigarettes. Second, Dr. Garner will explain that the efforts of American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson to achieve lower machine yield "tar" and nicotine levels in their cigarettes by utilizing different technologies accomplished significant reductions in these measures. Dr. Garner will then explain that the body of epidemiological evidence suggested that smokers of lower *ttarM and nicotine yield cigarettes had a lower incidence of lung cancer than smokers of higher yielding products. He will explain that the general reduction techniques used by American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson in their cigarettes to reduce smoke constituents, including carcinogens, resulted in lower machine yields in commercial cigarettes and that smokers of these cigarettes have lower exposures to smoke constituents than do smokers of higher yielding products.

Dr, Garner will describe the difference between general reduction and seleotive reduction of smoke constituents. He will testify that selective reduction is the effort to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents and will describe the efforts of Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco to selectively reduce certain of these constituents, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, aldehydes, and nitrosamines. Dr. Garner will testify that American Tobacco's and Brown & Williamson's efforts to reduce certain classes of smoke constituents were largely guided by suggestions from leading scientists and public health authorities, including the Surgeon General and the International Agency of Research on Cancer,

Dr, Garner will discuss generally the standardized Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") method to measure the "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes and its historical fiwetion as a

5pgNbr=257
relative ranking of commercial cigarettes. Dr. Garner will testify that the FTC Method does not, and was never intended to, predict any individual's smoking behavior. He may also, discuss the issue of smoker "compensation*'generally.

Dr. Garner is prepared to discuss allegations regarding nicotine manipulation and the subjects of smoke pH and the use of ammonia in cigarettes.

Dr, Garner will testify that there has never been a consensus as to what constitutes a safer cigarette. He will discuss how, despite this lack of consensus, American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson worked to develop cigarettes or novel products with reduced risk potential. Dr. Garner will also testify about Reynolds* work on products such as Premier and Eclipse, as well as Reynolds' own efforts to develop reduced risk products.

In addition to being prepared to testify about Reynolds' product stewardship program, Dr. Garner may offer testimony concerning Reynolds* current positions on smoking and health, statements on Reynolds' website, and Reynolds* efforts to develop smokeless tobacco products and to migrate smokers to those products. He may also testify about corporate entities such as Targacept, R. J. Reynolds Vapor Co, and Niconovum, and certain publicly available financial information such as MSA payments, excise and sales taxes, manufacturer's cost, and profit per cigarette pack. He may offer testimony regarding regulatory issues and the Food and Drug Administration.

Dr. Garner may also testify in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent that it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Gamer reserves the right to amend this disclosure.

And, of course, kids love Joe Camel

(http://www.businessinsider.com/vintage-cigarette-

ads-spokespeople-2012-5).

Newport is also gaining ground among young people.

While Marlboro is losing share among younger smokers, Azer says it may stabilize this trend with new products. Despite losing ground, Marlboro remains the biggest cigarette brand among kids and all ages.                              ~

Kids tend toward premium cigarettes because they smoke less, and they have a strong and growing preference for menthol.

Overall youth smoking rates are declining, which Azer says is "good."

Also: "This note in no way advocates cigarette use among underage individuals, as both we and the manufacturers strongly oppose underage cigarette consumption. The data reflected herein is all sourced from U.S. Governmenragencies, and highlights trends that the government and FDA are all readily aware of."

YOUNG ADULT SMOKER LIFE STYLES and ATTITUDES

INTRODUCTION

As part of an investigation of the "new" smoker, a program of consumer research was undertaken.   This research was done under ths direction of Kenyan & Eckhardt Advertising in early 1974.   The purpose of this research was to gain insight into the perceptions, attitudes and behavior of younger, recently-starting smokers regarding initial product usage, current smoking and health concerns. In addition, an effort was made to determine reactions to alternative product posltlonlngs.

Since the group focus technique was used, findings are both qualitative and reported on in a subjective manner.

Maintain this report under   -   Smoker Analysis, Section II. b.

KEY FINDINGS

Smoking starts with younger people for four reasons. One or more than one may be at work at any one time.   The first factor is the desire of young people to took older than they really are.   The second is peer pressure and doing what friends and authority figures do.   The third reason is to rebel against parents with only modest risk.   The fourth reason identified had to do with physical reaction,   This physical reaction wan described as a "high" or as a challenge to be strong enough to smoke without getting sick.

Once becoming regular smokers, young people still felt they wore not addicted. They continued to smoke cigarettes because thuy helped them relax in social situations, eased tension while under pressure, helped pass time, provided a sense of security, helped pace activity and eased the change from one activity to another.

;EY FINDINGS (cont'd)

Younger smokers have no real understanding of the tar levels of various brands but felt tar was the vlllian as regards cigarettes and health.   They are cynical about new or untried products and would be reluctant in investing in a trial pack because of having had ao many previous dis* appointments.   Marlboro is thought of as the "expected" cigarette*   Kool was thought of as a follow-up to chase a marijuana cigarette.

Health concerns exist among younger smokers.   The concerns tended to be about the immediate affects of smoking -a loss in physical prowess.   One type of smoker rationalised smoking as a pleasure that outweighed the risks.  Another felt that they didn't smoke enough to be dangerous.   A third type rationalised his use of cigarettes by feeling he would quit before it was "too late." A final smoker group said that science would come to bis rescue.

Reaction to Hi-Fi products were negative.  While thought of as better for you, the trade off with taste didn't justify using them.   People felt you just smoked more of them.

While the above comments apply to both men and women, it appeared that women were more passive and less outspoken than men about smoking.   They seem to emulate men In their brand selection and their adoption of smoking in general.

HI.     DETAILED FINDINGS

In talking to young people about smoking, K&B found a striking difference between the young men and the young women.   On the whole, the young men were exceedingly in* volved with all aspects of smoking while the young women can best bo doscribed as somewhat "wishy-washy" about the topic.   To a large extent the smoking behavior of the young women seemed to reflect a copying of their male peers.   Because of this, while much of what follows applies to the women to a certain degree, K&E decided to focus

our discussion of the findings on the youns tten.  Specific differences between the two groups will be pointed out in a separate section of the report.

A.   Starting to Smoke

MoBt of the young men spoken to indicated very early initial experiences with cigarettes. Many talked about first frying a cigarette before the age of ten.   Usually these were isolated experiences of stealing one cigarette from a parent, trying it and going no further for a few years. The next step In the process seemed to take place in Junior High School or In the early high school years.   During this stage, the respondents recalled sneaking cigarettes "behind the school," " at parties,"  "in the bathroom", etc.   In discussing why they started, many indicated that they smoked because they wanted to look older or more mature.   Several referred to older siblings who smoked and the desire to be like them.   In effect, the respondents were talking abovit an emulation of the group just ahead of themselves.   For these people, smoking pro* vided a means of bridging the gap to that older age group and of giving the appearance of having the privileges and experience of those older than themselves,

Another important reason given for starting to smoke was peer pressure,   Ove and over, re* spondents talked about the fact that, at that time, most of their friends were smoking and, if one did not smoke, he became an object of ridicule and teasing.   Some recollected being called a "sissy" by friends until they started to smoke,   In this vein, ft is interesting to note that most of the cigarette smoking done at that time was described ps group behavior    very few recalled smoking when alone during that period.   It can probably be            .   .

safely said that smoking also represented a means of reassuring themselves and telling others that they "belonged" to a group.

<contd>

Smoking at that age, apparently forbidden by parents and other adult authorities, was a sign of courage and, importantly, reflected the "us against them" attitude of the early teen years. In discussing why they started to smoke, many cited the simple fact that their parents told them not to.

In the contect of this discussion, the young men brought op their initial physical reaction to cigarettes*  On this dimension, there seemed to be two different types of people.   One type spoke of an extremely pleasant reaction to their first cigarettes.   The consensus among this group was that smoking, at that time, wtua like "getting high." Several recounted lying on the roof of the house at night and smoking one cigarette after another until they were so "high" they could barely stand up. Interestingly, there appeared to be some nostalgia for that feeling which seemed to disappear after smoking for a while.

The second type described their reaction to their first cigarettes as "getting sick." The symptoms described ranged from diszyness and nausea to vomiting and "passing out,"

To these people, learning to smoke became a challenge and they made a conscious effort to learn how to smoke.   Prom their description, overcoming the unpleasant physical reaction became a strongly motivated goal.   The psychological rewards for "con* quering" smoking seemed to center on proving manliness and strength to themselves and others and, for the most part, they seemed to feel that it was worth the effort.

B.   Current Smoking Behavior

While early smoking tended to be somewhat sporadic for these yoong men, and primarily engaged in only with the friends associated with starting,

Current Smoklntf ftehavior (cont'd)

cigarettes were now purchased and smoked regularly. In fact, even though our criterion for participation was one-half pack per day, virtually all of the respondents claimed to smoke a full pack or more per day.   In light of this, it was surprising to find a denial of smoking being & habit at this point.   Many respondents indicated that they were not "addicted" to smoking and that they "could stop anytime" they wanted to.

In spite of this habit denial on the part of the respondents, it became apparent that the traditional patterns of smoking were' ingrained in them at this point.   In discussing situations in which these young men felt they had a tendency to smoke, it became clear that cigarettes fulfill several, sometimes paradoxical, functions for them.   One type of smoking that was almost universally engaged in was what might be termed social smoking.  Almost all of the respondents claimed an increase in smoking when at parties or on dates.  In moat cases, this increase in smoking was related to consumption of alcholic beverages, most particularly beor.   The general feeling seemed to be that the two tastes and sensations tended to enhance one another, making each more pleasurable when done together.  In these social smoking situations, the cigarette was described as a contributor to their relaxation and enjoyment.

Quite opposite to the satisfaction obtained in social smoking situations was the role of the cigarette in what might bedescribed as tension smoking situations. Even at their younfe age, these respondents spoke of the pressures of school and tor work and of the tendency to smoke one cigarette after another in such situations. Under high tension circumstances, cigarettes were not described us enjoyable, but were thought of as more of a tranquilizer or pacifier.   It was almost as though the physical act of smoking provided a mean of "letting off some or the steam." In tension situations, some respondents claimed to be so unaware of the cigarette itself that they often found themselves lighting a second cigarette while one sat in an ashtray burning.

B.    Current Smoking Behavior (cont'd)

Another Interesting type of tension smoking related to social situations.   Many respondents claimed a tendency to smoke ft lot when they feel self-conscious or uncomfortable.   This occurred when they felt that they were not really part of the group, if they felt "different" from other people present, or if they did not know how to handle themselves In a social situation. These people indicated that at such times, a cigarette provided "something to do" making them feel more at ease*

Respondents seemed to feel that they also had a tendency to smoke more than usual when they are bored.   They spoke of boring classes, being alone with nothing to do, watching television, etc., in this context  When bored, the cigarette gives them something to do.

In many instances, smoking a cigarette was described as a "pause" 0r & "break." In one sense, this aspect of smoking was closely aligned to the traditional coffee break - the person is busy doing something and has a cigarette as a means of stopping for a few minutes to relax.  In another sense, this "pause" aspect of smoking was described as an opportunity to stop for a minute to gather one's thoughts. This usually took place during the course of a conversation in which the respondent claimed he didn't know what to say next - the lighting of a cigarette provided an excuse or a postponement, allowing him to think.

An Interesting observation of their smoking behavior made by the respondents was the tendency to light a cigarette with any "change of scene."   The general feeling seemed to be that the lighting of a cigarette was an af* firmation that they were going to do something -  make a phono call, start a project at work, study, relax, etc.

Perhaps the underlying mechanism tn all of the above, was the perception of the cigarette as a companion.   For many, just the knowledge of possession of their cigarettes was enough to provide some sense of "security." Being out of cigarettes caused anxiety for many -  some went

so far as to go out in the middle of the night to buy a pack.   Several who had tried to stop smoking claimed that they were fine as long as they knew that cigarettes were "there." And, many claimed that cigarettes made them feel better when alone and lonely.

C    Brand jgerceptiojig.

In talking to these young smokers about the different brands of cigarettes they have smoked, we found that they have little knowledge and, in fact, a great deal of misinformation on brand yields.  In all of the sessions, not a single respondent know the tar and nicotine level or the cigarette he or she smoked. In many cases, high tar brands were perceived as mild or high filtration cigarettes - for example, smokers of Benson & Hedges 100's who had switched from Marlboro because Benson & Hedges is mild and "better for you."

These young people showed somewhat confirmed preferences for menthon vs. regular cigarettes.   The plain filter smoker was somewhat more likely to try a menthol occasionally -   the menthol smoker often refused non-menthol even if nothing else was available.

In the course of their early smoking, the* young men indicated a great deal of brand experimentation. Part of this was a function of smoking "whatever they could get their hands on" but a good deal of it was a conscious trying of different cigarettes.   It was surprising to hear some fairly esoteric brands - e.g.. Bull Durhoms and New Leaf -  mentioned in this context.   While this early experimentation does signal an area of opportunity, it has, unfortunately, a tendency to create a substantial amount of cynicism towards new or previously untried cigarettes.   This is due to the fact that more often than not, the respondents indicated that they did not like the cigarettes they had tried. Taking this one step further, the respondents spoke of an unwillingness to spend the money for a whole pack of cigarettes (thought to be expensive) to try something

C.   Brand Perce qtjons  (cont'd)

they were not likely to enjoy and "wind up throwing the pack away." In short, there seems to be a definite price block in new cigarette purchases and a definite readiness to try anything tt it is given to them free*

In talking to Marlboro smokers, so predominant in the age group studied, K& attempted to obtain an articulation of the appeal of that brand.   From most of these young people, the response indicated that Marlboro was simply available*   The general feeling seemed to be that since so many of their peers were smoking Marlboro, whenever they "grubbed" a cigarette, it was Marlboro and they just got used to them. That canj>robably be extended to mean that Marlboro became the "expectable" cigarette for this age group. Another interesting aspect brought up by some of the Marlboro smokers was their perception of Marlboro's similarity, in taste and satisfaction, to non-filters. For these people, a non-filter was the ideal cigarette, but recognition of health factors kept them from smoking non-filters regularly.   These respondents spoke of "treating themselves to an occasional Camel."

Kool was spontaneously mentioned most often in the context of what Beems to have become a cultural ritual  *  menthol and plan filter smokers alike smoked Kool after smoking marijuana. Not just any menthol would do - it had to be Kool.   The consensus was that the two "just go together." Apparently, among this group, Kool Is perceived as having the strongest menthol and thus relieves the dryness of the throat caused by marijuana.

In talking about the various brands, perhaps one of the most important things learned was that there seem to bo substantial blocks against repositioning established brands.   Established brands have strong Images among this group which would be difficult, if not impossible, to change.   In addition to the presence of strong imagery, resentment was found among the respondents towards brands obviously trying to copy Marlboro.   At the time of the interviews, Luke had just been introduced in Oklahoma City and was frequently mentioned in this context.  In California, L&M* whose new campaign had recently been launched, was the victim.                 030502

Attitudes Toward the Effects of Smoking on Health

Since this is the generation that grew up with anti-smoking films in school and anti-smoking campaigns on television, it was interesting to hear their feelings about the health issue.  Concern about health among thier age group was quite evident and should not be minimised.   Most of the Initial conversation centered on more immediate symptoms from smoking and concern about effects on physical prowess.   Many cited the fact that they cannot run, swim or engage in any strenuous exercise with the intensity that they used to. They complained about shortness of breath and a general lack of endurance.

After some probing, the respondents did focus on long term health concerns -  i.e., various heart and lung diseases.   Basically, there were four distinct reactions to these problems.   One type simply felt that the pleasure derived from smoking outweighs the risks.

A second type rationalized that he doesn't smoke enough to really endanger his health -  interesting in view of the feet that the lightest smokers in these groups were up to a pack per day.

A third type was quite certain that he would stop "someday" when he is old enough to really have to worry about it*  Ironically, one of the respondents who fell into this category had spoken of a parent who is dying of emphysema and cannot stop smoking.

Finally, the fourth type was relying on science to develop euros for all of these diseases by the time he could get them.

An interesting aspect of the respondents* attitudes about health was an apparent double standard for themselves vs. their parents.   They fully recognize the fact that they were the ones who told their parents to stop after seeing school and commercial films, but when asked to reconcile that with their current smoking, they merely shrugged their shoulders.

.   Attitudes Toward tho Effects of Smoking on Health, (cont'd)

In discussing how a smoker can limit the risks of serious disease without actually giving up smoking, the respondents clearly recognised the role of high filtration cigarettes.   Their response to high nitration was basically negative; hi-fi products being evaluated in terms of "trade-offs." Low tar was thought of as "better for you", but low tar cigarettes were perceived as having no taste and as being   like smoking air," The general feeling seemed to be "if I'm going to Btnoke, I might as well enjoy it." Many respondents claimed that they had tried a low tar cigarette, but found that they were smoking significantly more per day.   These people felt that the increase in smoking was enough to cancel out the difference in tar and nicotine yield.   It can be hypothesized that the underlying mechanism working against acceptance of high filtration brands in this age group is that the image of these cigarettes is contrary to one of the initial motivations for smoking - to look manly and strong.

.   Difference in Reactions of the Young Women

As mentioned earlier* the young women were simply not as involved with smoking as the young men were.   The young men talked a great deal about tobacco, strength and "satisfaction" from a cigarette,   The young men were also quite involved in the sensual aspects of smoking -   aroma, texture, feel in the mouth, etc.   All of this wait, with a few exceptions, virtually absent from the interviews with young women.

On the whole, the young women tended to start smoking at an older age than their male peers -  late high school or early college was the general starting time,   They tended to try many fewer brands and, very importantly, had a tendency to copy young men in their brand choices.

MARKETING PLANNING APPROACH

Key articles and reports were furnished by R&D on the subject of the psychological and physiological aspects of smoking.   Marketing Planning edited these documents and assembled excerpts from them to help answer questions about future incidence and consumption.

Excerpts from R&D report B26R by D. J. Wood, "Why Do People Smoke", by H. Williams in Health, March, 1973; Smoking Behavior: Motives and Incentives hy Dunn, 1973; notes on the St. Martin Jsland Conference by I. W, Hughes have been used and much subjectivity  . was involved in culling out what was thought to be the more usable data.

SUMMARY and IMPXJCAYION3 to the TOVCTY

As long as young people are curious, antloip&tory of adulthood and seek bravado, cigarettes will be tried*   If there is a lessening in the need to conform to the herd, as may be the case according to Yankelovich, there could be a break in generic cigarette trial among this group,

If incidence among older family peers, (parents, brothers and sisters) remains constant, there will be a constant tendency for younger people to try smoking with other factors remaining the same.

As long as people seek ways to minimise stress and anxiety and maximize alertness and relaxation, cigarettes will be considered an alternative to other means .,. and perhaps better than pills or other drugs.

If the nicotine level or cigarettes fails to completely achieve the desired mood change that cigarette will be drawn on deeper, the smoke held   longer and consumption will rise (but consumption won't rise at the same rate as nicotine declines).

Reductions in nicotine are therefore compensated for by consumers but the limit to which they can compensate for the diminished nicotine/diminished therapeutic efficacy is unknown. RW> Is studying this subject at tho present time..

Because nicotine is perceived to Increase metabolism, cigarettes

may still be accurately thought of as a weight control agent.     030505

SUMMARY and IMPLICATIONS to the INDpSTRy (cont'd)

The rush of nicotine into the blood stream and nervous system is short-lived; therefore, reducing consumption would cause withdrawal and all of its unpleasant side effects so long as the smoker ia restricted from smoking.  Nicotine vacates the system in 30 minutes or so and at that time withdrawal starts.

Smoking may stem from tho relaxing aspect of sucking at the outset but benefits are learned beyond that of sucking. It is learned by users that smoking can relieve (at least partially) negative emotion and maintain positive ones.

The sensorimotor manipulation aspect of smoking is important to people but perhaps not as important a6 nicotine ...   There* fore, a nicotine injection would still leave a smoker hungry and undersatisfied.  Cigarettes allow people to self-administer nicotine and at a self-determined rate.

People smoke for a variety of social and biological needs. However, there are seven basic type of smokers:.

Smokers above all else are extroverts.   This has been correlated to physiological phenomena,   In fact, the more a person consumes cigarettes the less likely he Is to be passive.   They have higher divorce rates, accident rates, drink more coffee and alcohol and are generally more Impulsive.

Smokers appear In part to be produced through genetics solely advertising or peer pressure.

n.     SUMMARY and IMPLICATIONS to the INDUSTRY (cont'd)

When all smokers in an entire town in Iowa were pressured to quit smoking as part of an experiment, few- really did.   Even under seemingly tremendous peer pressure, only 3.8% of females and 14.2% of males could remain quitters after ? months.

HI.     RESEARCH APPROACHES

Research on the psychological and physiological aspects of smoking has been conducted using one of three basic approaches?

a.     Smokers and non-smokers are compared via psychological testing.

b.     Direct interrogation of respondents has taken place,

c.     Psychiatry attempts to break down the underlying reasons for smoking.

IV.     RESEARCH SHORTCOMINGS

Unfortunately much of the work in this area has little value.   The reasons are as follows:

a.     There is a lack of common definitions Tor various behaviors.

b.     Respondents sometimes aren't completely honest or accurate.

c.     Heavy use is made of univariate analysis (often there is more than one factor at work).

d.     Studies set out to prove points, not gather facts.

e.     Samples aren't representative of the population.

f.      Conclusions are based on data lacking in statistical significance.

RESEARCH SHORTCOflONCS  (cont'd)

g.    Findings apply only to respondent groups and many of these are U.K. or Canadian residents using English cigarettes.

However, some research does have application to the U.S. smoker. When such research avoided the pitfalls described above, vas corroborated and appeared consistent with other findings, it was outlined here for review,

RESEARCH RESULTS

A.   Smoking by Children and Adults 1.    Children 

Those who start to smoke at a comparatively early age, at ten or twelve years, go through a long period of experimenting with cigarettes before taking up smoking seriously.

McKennell and Thomas in their social survey, "Adults and Adolescents Smoking Habits'\ 1967, showed that, at the age of sixteen, 57% of boys and 63% of girls were smoking as many as one cigarette a day.   It was during this period that the foundations of the smoking habit were laid. Four out of five young people who had smoked more than one cigarette subsequently became regular smokers.   Conversely, according to the survey, if a youngster were still a non-smoker at twenty, he would be unlikely to' take up the habit.

With adults a different situation exists.   Only an exceptional 2T smoke occasionally and intermittently.   Nearly all regular smokers are nicotine dependent*

Dr. J. M. Bynner in his Burvey, "The Young Smoker", showed that thft factors listed below influenced the smoking habits of schoolboys:

030508 170040990pgNbr=292
- 5-

Children (cont'd)

a.     Curiosity and experiment may be the initiating factors but, qb the first few cigarettes are almost invariably unpleasant, curiosity may Boon be satisfied.

b.     More lasting is the need for conformity or 'following the herd.'  Boys who said none of their friends smoked were themselves non-smokers.  Among the smokers. 62% admitted that all their It-lends smoked.

o.    Linked with this need for conformity is bravado or the desire to appear tough.

d.     Another factor Is anticipation of adulthood.

e.     The factora already listed are associated with lack of educational success.

The unsuccessful schoolboy has to compensate for his failure and find status in the out-of-school culture, so he seoks to share the activities of older boys, drinking, driving and staying out late. He will probably leave school early and this could increase his smoking enormously.   Fifteen-year olds who have left school are more than twice as likely to be smokers as those who are at school (Todd,  1969).

Smoking is most common among boys who come from large families in which older brothers and sisters smoke and parents condone the habit, Children of parents who smoke are more likely to succumb than those of norrsmoking parents,

From successive studies of young smokers, a fairly consistent picture of important factors is emerging.   These are social class, parental example, the smoking habits of older siblings and friends, type of school, academic achievement, church attendance and drinking habits.

Children (cont'd)

Not only is smoking associated with 'normal' drinking but it is statistically linked with alcoholism*   Among the alcohotics and neurotics attending the same hospital out-patient department< 93% of the alcoholics were smokers compared with 90$ of the neurotics.   Further studies have shown smoking to be allied with the use of other drugs.   In a sample of registered heroin addicts attending clinics in London, 99% were smokers compared with 58% in the general population.

Adults

a.    Nicotine

It has been said, 'If it were not for nicotine in tobacco smoke, people would be little more inclined to smoke cigarettes than they are to blow bubbles or light sparklers.' (Michael Russell. 1971).

As the novice acquires tolerance to the irritation of the smoke over a period of two or three years, he becomes conditioned to a high and regular intake of nicotine.   As the nicotine content of cigarettes varies from one to three milligrams per cigarette, the regular twenty a-day smoker will absorb from 20 5o 60 milligrams every twenty-four hours, enough to cause serious physical upset or even death if administered intravenously in one dose.

The effect of nicotine on the brain is to increase the level of arousal.   In animal experiments, Armitaga and others (1968) have shown that when thirsty rats are trained to press a lever to obtain water, they will do this twice as frequently in a given time if they are dosed with nicotine. This Is believed to be due to the release of acetyl choline at the synapses, or

030510 1700409953pgNbr=294
- 7-

a. , Nicotine (cont'd)

nerve-cell junctions, and this speeds up reactions in the animals.   When larger doses of nicotine were given less frequently there was sometimes a decrease in the cortical, or brain, acetyl choline output and this resulted in a lessening of cortical activity.   Nicotine can, therefore, have two effects.   This and the considerable Individual variations observed in man and animals provide some support for apparently contradictory claims of smokers who find the habit both stimulating and relaxing, and undoubtedly desirable on this account,

Eyaenck observes that smokers of cigarettes with different nicotine levels attempt to obtain a constant intake of nicotine by changing the puffing pattern and increasing the number of cigarettes where the particular cigarette is low in nicotine.

ftermstra put smokers, non-smokers and deprived smokers through simulated driving tests for periods of three to six hours In a confined space.   As time passed, smokers consumed increasing numbers of cigarettes. The test also established that in terms of coping with environmental stress, smokers are probably somewhat better than non-smokers.   The performance of deprived smokers dropped markedly with Increased feelings of aggression.

Scharter's testing Is also of Interest, Smokers and non-smokers were taken and subjected to personality analysis.   The smokers and non-smokers were subjected to a series or shocks and the number taken at the point the subject did not wish to bear more,   The findings were that smokers can withstand higher pain levels than non-smokers. Increased nicotine increased the ability to withstand pain levels.

a.    Ntco^ne (cont(d)

While the known pharmacological effects of nicotine help account for some of these phenomena many other pharmacological effects have not been fully isolated.   Under* standing these phenomena may throw further light on the subject of why people smoke.

b.   -Physical Dependence

   Physical dependence involves changes which are physiological.   Firstly, this is shown by the smoker's tolerance to the effects of nicotine,   This is doe to changes at the synapses.   The smoker also has an increased capacity to metabolise and excrete the drug, mainly in the liver.   Non-smokers excrete in their urine proportionately higher doses of unchanged nicotine than smokers.

Secondly, when the intake of nicotine is reduced or discontinued, the smoker may

experience withdrawal symptoms, resulting from the lessening of overactivity at the synapses.  According to Russell, to prove dependence on a drug it is crucial that its withdrawal leads to some negative effects. Thus withdrawal or cigarettes from heavy smokers may reduce them to a subjectively distressed 8lute, with symptoms of anxiety, depression, irritability, restlessness, Intense craving as well as difficulty in concentration.

The distinction Iwtwen psychological uml physical erfects is felt to be a fine ont. "Subjective symptoms labelled by the unsympathetic as 'merely psychological! may well be governed by physiological mechanisms in the hypothalamic reward system/'   says Howard Williams.

b.    physical fiependenca (cont'd)

Deneau and Inoki (188?) have shown that monkeys can be trained to inject themselves with nicotine for its own sake, just as they will inject other dependence*producing drugs, e.g., opiates, caffeine, amphetamine, cocaine.   Research has shown that stimulation of the medial fore* brain bundle of the hypothalamus can plensurably preoccupy an animal to the exclusion of all other basic activities, e.g., eating, drinking, sexual activities.   It seems likely that nicotine and other dependence-producing drugs owe part of their effectiveness to influencing this centre.

This effect in the case of cigarette smoking is rapid but passing.   The absorption of nicotine through the lungs is as quick as the junkie's' 'fix', (Russell).   The blood-brain barrier is no barrier to nicotine which reaches  the brain within a minute of a person lighting up. Its effect is short-lived.   In twenty to thirty minutes after the smoker has finished his cigarette, most of the nicotine has left his brain for other organs - stomach, liver and kidneys - and this is just about the time that the heavily dependent smoker needs his next' cigarette.

Social Theories of Multiple Motivation

In ronent years four theories have been put forward which claim that there are several different reasons for smoking which have varying degrees of importance.

I,    Tnmkins' Tfteory

tn this theory, smoking is seen as an aid to handling human emotions,   It stresses the importance of positive as well as or negative emotions.   Tomkins believes that smoking has an innate basis in the sucking response as well as a learned basis derived

CO COpgNbr=297

* Tomklns' Theory (cont'd)

from actual experiences of smoking.  Innately, sucking or smoking is considered capable of re* ducing distress and of evoking enjoyment.   But in addition to this smokers develop learned responses, since they learn by experience that smoking can relieve any negative emotion and can evoke any positive emotion.   On the basis of this theory, four general types of smoking behavior are distinguished:

a.    Habitual Smoking

Here the individual may. originally have smoked to reduce feelings of distress or to experience a positive feeling of uplift, but he has long since ceased to do so.   He smokes as if it made him fuel good, or better, but in fact it does neither; he may hardly be aware that he has a cigarette in his mouth.

b.     Positive Affect Smoking

As far as the smoker who smokes for pleasure is concerned, Tomkins distinguishes between smoking as a Stimulant in order to experience positive feelings of excitement, and smoking as a relaxant to experience positive feelings of enjoyment,

c.    Negative Affect Smoking

This might be termed sedattvo smoking, in which the- individual smokes primarily to reduce his feelings of distress, fear, shame, disgust or any combination or these.   So long . as all goes well he may not smoke; it is only when be is in trouble that he thinks of smoking.

030514 170040996pgNbr=298
II- 

d.    Addictive Smoking

The addictive smoker smokes both Tor enjoyment and to reduce unpleasant feelings.   He (a always aware that he is not smoking whenever this occurs, and such awareness invariably evokes distress: the addictive smoker suffers whenever he Is without a cigarette.   He thinks that only a cigarette will reduce his suffering, and that there is no substitutes.

The Theory of Ikard, Oreen and Horn

This theory is an extension of Tomkins1 theory. The authors set out deliberately to test Tomkins1 four type a of smoking behavior, and added a fifth described aa "sensorimotor manipulation1'* This is concerned with the reward derived from lighting and handling a cigarette, and watching the smoke curl upward.   A questionnaire consisting or 23 Heme was constructed ond was usedlnlnterviewo of 2094 American smokers drawn from a national probability sample of adults.

Ftictor analysis, performed on the answers to the questionnaire, revealed the following six types of smoking behaviour:

McKenneU's Theory

Rather than ask smokers direct questions about why they smoked, which they regarded as a very dubious approach, McKennell and Thomas decided to explore the kinds of occasion on which different people smoked and then to deduce from these smoking occasions their underlying motive*.   Their answers were then subjected to principal component analysis and factor analysis, which revealed the following seven types of smoking behaviour;

a.    Nervous irritation smoking (smokes when anxious, etc.)

b.    Relaxation smoking (smokes when happy)

c.    Smoking alone (smokes when by oneself)

d.    Activity accompaniment (smokes when working hard, etc.)

e.    Food substitution (smokes when feeling hungry, etc.

f.     Social smoking (smokes when talking, etc.}

g.    Social confidence (smoking bolsters self-confidence)

Principal component analysis showed a distinction hetwecn the first five factors and the Inst two. According to McKennell the Tirat five partly overlapping factors represent the "inner need" or drive, to smoke, whereas tho two social factors reflect the external situation within which smoking is .conducted.   The commonest smoking patterns were found In be smoking alone, social smoking, nervous irritation smoking and relaxation smoking, while.the least common were activity accompaniment smoking and food substitution smoking.

In a further study, sponsored this time by the Tobacco Research Council, McKennell set out to ro-tcst his own thoory, to compare it with what ho colls tho "Horn-Tomkins" theory and to Investigate tho extent to which smokers fall into distinctive types with different motivational patterns/                                                 030516

McKennell's Theory (cont'd)

The answers to the questionnaire were analyzed using a number of different statistical techniques. Factor analysis on Horn's items revealed the same six factors as previously.

In order to investigate the extent to which smokers fall into distinctive types, with different motivational patterns, McKennel 1 made use of cluster analysis. This showed that the subjects interviewed did not conform exclusively to one factor or another: elements of all eight McKennell factors could be found in most subjects, but to different relative degrees.  Seven clusters emerged, each cluster representing a group of smokers with a distinctive motivational pattern. These can be summarised as follows:

Cluster Mo. 1 -   these score low on all the factors, and thus appear only weakly motivated to smoke.

Cluster No. 2    *   these are generally similar to Cluster No. 1 except that they have somewhat higher scores for Relaxation and distinctly higher scoreB for Social Smoking.

Cluster No. ?       these have generally low scores for the "inner need" factors; they smoke mainly for social reasons, particularly Social Confidence.

Cluster No. 4    -   those have medium scores for the "inner need" factors (with the exception of Foo'd Substitution which is not important for them) but they tend not to smoke for social reasons.

Cluster No. 5    -   these have medium scores for most

of the "inner need" and social factors, but a particularly high score for Food Substitution.

Cluster No. 6    -   these have medium scores for the "inner need" factors, fairly high scores for the social factors, and ahove alt are reluctant smokers.

McKennejl's'fheory (cont'd)

Cluster No, 7 -   these have high scores for the "inner need" factors, par tic* ularly Activity Accompaniment and Food Substitution, but only medium scores for the social factors.

The clusters are numbered in ascending order of the scores for the "inner need" dimension, McKennell found that, as the scores For this dimension increased, so also did the consumption of cigarettes, the extent to which smokers inhaled, the extent to which they reported a craving for cigarettes when the latter were not available, and the difficulty they anticipated, or actually found, in giving up smoking.

Eysenck carried out two surveys in the U.K.   He found that smoking was not retated to neuroticism, but that it was significantly related to extroversion* Che amount of extroversion increased from non* smokers to light, to medium, and finally to heavy cigarette smokers who were the most extroverted of all. Eyaenek's explanation of the relationship between extroversion and cigarette smoking is that extroverts are characterized by Inhibitory activity in the brain cortex whereas introverts are characterised by excitatory activity in the cortex.  Inhibitory activity in this sense means interference with mental attention and the on-going work of the brain. Extroverts have a hunger for stimulation and for removal of cortical inhibition, thereby enabling them to perceive, think, pay attention and act more efficiently.

In support or Eysenck's hypothesis, Mataranzo and Saslow found that cigarette smokers as a group onvinccd typical extrovert behaviour patterns: compared with non-smokers they drank more coffee and alcohol, were more frequently involved in driving accidents, had a higher divorce rate, changed jobs more frequently and were impulsive.

Genetics and Smoking

S.S, Kety summarizes research done by Shields In a book Smoking Behavior: Motives End Incentives.   Thla research paired identical twins who were reared apart.   The findings were that cigarette usage nmong these twins could be predicted if the us age /non- us age of one were known at a level well above chance - 33% better.

A second report, also appearing in Smoking Behavior;, Motives and Incentives, described ft community wide effort for everyone in a small Iowa town to quit smoking at the same time.   It was entitled Cold Turkey in Greenfield, Iowa  a follow-up study.

A large number of smokers (62.6%) reported that they had not quit "cold turkey" with the town.   About 23% of these nonquitters had cut back their consumption, however, and almost all claimod they had not smoked in public out of respecWor those who were trying to quit. Part of the campaign's apparent success stemmed from this nonquitter switch from both public and private smoking to only private smoking*

or the would-be quitters, the men were more successful than the women.   Compared to men as a group, the women or Greenfield were less likely to have been Bmokers, less likely to have participated in the anti-smoking campaign, less likely to have Succeeded in staying off for 30 days, and once off their cigarettes they were less likely to have stayed off for 7 months.   Only 3.9? of the female active smokers and 14.2% of the male active smokers were able to say oH for 7 months.   These long-term quitters represented about 10. 6ft of the original smoking population.

    industry Besponse to Cigarette/Health Controversy

The tobacco industry has reacted to the challenge of the smoking^and health controversy in the following ways:

(1)  produce more filter brands and .brands with lower tar delivery.

(2)  Support scientific research to refute unfavorable findings, or at a minimum to keep the scientific question open.

(3)  Conduct information campaigns against claims by the, antlsmdking lobby.

*

(4)  Voluntarily meet some of the demands of the antismok,lng lobby, such as agreeing to publish the FTC ratings on tar and nicotine in cigarette advertising.

(5)  'Corporate diversification to minimize the potential adverse

financial consequences of the controversy on oigarette sales.

The purpose of this note is to examine the history of the interaction between the tobacco companies on one hand and the antismoklng groups on the other hand, including particularly government agencies, with regard to the cigarette/health controversy. Corporate diversification Into other product lines and industries is not appropriate for discussion here. It is of some interest, however, to consider briefly the informational and research response of industry before getting into the story of the direct confrontation between the contending forces.

The Tobacco Institute, founded in 1958, has been thetfocal point for criticism of research that indicates- a connection between smoking-and health. The Institute has attempted to keep the- opposition honest. It has carefully scrutiniz^R the sampling difficulties and statistical deficiencies in the studies which allegedly indicate correlations between smoking and disease. The Institute also has vigorously opposed governmental control of the marketing of cigarettes, This rearguard action has bought time in which the companies could adapt to the challenge, i.e. change themselves (through diversification) and change their products.

The Council for Tobacco Research (CTHJ has dispersed over $28 million through 1973. During the past 20 years the industry has committed more than $50 million to scientific research related to tobacco and health. In December 1972, five cigarette companies including Brown & Williamson gave a $2.8 million grant to the Harvard Medical School for a 5-year investigation of any specific effects oigarette smoke may have in the development of lung and heart diseases. In 1967, over $12 million was spent in the United States on smoking and health research.- In 1968,the figure increased to over $15 million.

have allowed the industry to take a respectable stand along the following lines -                                                                        ' ,

?'After millions of dollars and over twenty years of     -***.... research, the question about smoking and health is .still open/'

The tobacco companies have also beefed-up their proprietary research expenditures* The initial wave of negative scientific findings caused substantial increases,in R&D budgets. Also, the proliferation of new brands demanded considerable attention to the need for greater and faster technical responses in product development. *

The industry has moved strongly toward filter cigarettes, which have/*-' increased from .6% in 1050 to 87% in 1075. KENT cigarettes were introduced in 1952 with an unusually heavy promotion camp'aign discussing the micronite filter. Other companies moved strongly into the rapidly growing filter market, In 1051, nine out of twenty brands on the market accounted for as much as 1% bf market share. By  1964, 17 of 41 brands had more than 1% share of market,

This became known as the "tar derby11 of the late 'l0BOfs. It'was characterised by sharply intensified advertising competition. By 1063 well over half of the total unit output was composed of brands which were unknown before 1950.

The new filter brands vying for a pieoe of the growing filter market made extraordinary claims. There was an urgent effort to highlight and differentiate one brand from the others already on the market. It was important to have the most filter traps, Some claimed to possess the least tars. In most cases, however, the smoker of a filter cigarette was getting as much or more nicotine and tar as he would have gotten from a regular cigarette. He had j&bandone.d the regular cigarette, however, on the ground of reduced risk to health. '

This- sort of advertising led to the first attempts by the Federal Trade Commission to regulate the industry, A further consequence of the "tar derby" was the rapid increase in advertising expenditures during this period. Advertising expenditures in selected media jumped from over_$85 million in 1952 to approximately $150 million in 1059. The "tar derby" was ended by a voluntary agreement between the FTC and the cigarette companies in 1960, The competition in advertising continued to be fierce, however, with expenditures doubling again by 1970 to a figure of approximately $314 million.

In announcing the agreement, Earl W, Kintner, then FTC Chairman, stated that in "the absence of a satisfactory uniform test and proof-of advantage to the smoker, there will .be no more tar and nicotine claims in advertising," Kintner said the tar and nicotine blackout was "a landmark example of industry-government cooperation in solving a pressing problem," The Consumers Union, however, felt that the end of the "tar derby" was to the industry's advantage and to the public*s disadvantage. It said that the cigarette .industry had succeeded in extricating itself from the embarrassing position it

had occupied since the health disclosures of the early 1950*9  that of constantly reminding its consumers through its own advertising that cigarettes carried a real threat to their health. The Reader's Digest, a severe critic of the industry, also blamed the FTC for "discouraging the manufacture of high filtration oigarettes and for rescuing the smoker from chaps only to leave him in ignorance." Later the FTC reversed itself and began testing and publishing the results respecting tar and nicotine content

1964 Surgeon General's Report

The FTC had requested technical assistance and aid from^the Public Health Service regarding labeling and advertising of,tobacco products. . Flowing from this request was an announcement by the Surgeon General on June 7, 1962 that he was establishing an expert advisory committee to review all available data on smoking and health. A medical doctor from the FTC was an observer who participated in the first discussions of the advisory committee, The result was the 1964 Surgeon General's Report. On the same day that the advisory committee report was released by the Surgeon General, the FTC announced its intention to move promptly to determine what remedial action the FTC should take in.the public interest. A week later the FTC notified interested parties of its proposed rulemaking "for the prevention of unfair or deceptive advertising and labeling of cigarettes in relation to the health hazards of smoking,"

The FTC stated that it had "reason to believe that many current advertisements falsely state, or give the false impression, that     cigarette smoking promotes health or physical well-being or is not a health hazard, or that smoking the advertised brand is less of a health hazard than smoking other brands of cigarettes." The FTC thought then that such advertising should be stopped^and it continues to think it should be stopped*                                      *

Ths Commission also said, more than a decade ago, that "Much current advertising suggests or portrays cigarette smoking as being pleasurable or desirable, compatible with physical health, fitness or well- . being, or indispensable to full personal development and social success, without at the same time reminding the consumer of the serious health hazard of cigarette smoking. Such advertising may create a psychological and social barrier to the consuming public's understanding and appreciation of the gravity of the risks to life and health involved in cigarette smoking," The FTC continues to advooate strict repressive controls on cigarette advertising notwithstanding the advent of a warning both on packages and-in. advertising.

In its 1964 trade, rule request, the FTC asked for a health warning in . cigarette advertisements and on packages. It further sought to forbid advertising that stated or implied that cigarettes (1) promote good health or physical well-being, (2) is not a hazard to health or  (3) is less a hazard to health than smoking other*brands.

Counsel for the companies specifically contested the jurisdiction and authority of the Commission to promulgate the proposed trade regulation rules Court action was threatened which would certainly delay and would possibly overturn the FTC action,                                   ..v.,.,..

Also support was mobilized in other industries. The Grocery Manufacturers of America, tnc, stated that the proposed rules were an undesirable extension of power which was better left to Congressional legislation. The Advertising Federation of America and the Television Bureau of Advertising, Inc. claimed that it might establish a dangerous, precedent for rulemaking against other industries. The American Newspaper Publishers Association (ANPA) and the Radio Advertising Bureau, Inc. followed the tobacco industry's pattern in denying

that the Commission had the authority to act*    ' *

                                                

Cigarette Labeling: and Advertising Act of 196S

The proposed 1964 FTC Trade Regulation was preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 which froze the FTC's ability to wove in the area.until June 1969, In May 1969 the FTC renewed its pressure for increased government regulation of cigarette advertising. It announced that, it would consider a proposed rule requiring that all cigarette advertising disclose the following warning;

Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous To Health And May Cause Death From Cancer, Coronary Heart Disease, Chronic Bronchitis, Pulmonary Emphysema, And Other Diseases,

In the 1969 Report to Congress, the FTC pointed to a Harris Poll indicating that over 50% of the public favored banning all cigarette advertising from television and radio. In addition fo asking Congress to require the foregoing warning on packages and in advertising, the  FTC asked that tar and nicotine content of each cigarette be printed on the package and in all advertising.

'The companies sought to defuse the attaok by voluntarily agreeing in September 1970 to disolose tar and nidotine content in advertising and in 1972 by entering into a Consent Order under which the Burgeon General's warning would be printed in all cigarette advertising. These agreements were mad with the express understanding that the industry maintained its denial that the warning was necessary in order to avoid deceptiveness in its advertising or that the warning was an accurate statement of fact. When the first T&N figures were released by the FTC in November 1967, The Tobacco Institute released a statement saying that there was no scientifically established relationship between tar and nicotine levels and human health. Also, the companies maintained the position that the voluntary agreements did not constitute'an admission by the industry that the FTC has authority to promulgate trade regulation rules,    -Recently Congress has granted trade regulation rule power to the FTC.

Other Agency Actions

In June 1967 the Federal Communications Commission surprised the industry by announcing that the Fairness Doctrine required broad*

casters to publish antisraoking comment. Roughly one antismoking.....-

. commercial for three cigarette commercials was used as the measure of balance in presenting both sides of the issue. .This amounted to approximately $7 9 million worth of free promotion ea'oh year. The courts upheld the FCC's Fairness Doctrine ruling in November 1968. In February 1069 the FCC released a second proposed rule and announced t that it would ban the broadcast of cigarette commercials by radio and television stations. In the 1969 notice of proposed rulemaking, the FCC stated that presentation of cigarette commercials, is inconsistent . with the obligation imposed on broadcasters to operate in the public,. ^ interest. It said that cigarettes posed a "unique danger - a danger./* measured in terms of an epidemic of deaths and disabilities." The tobacco industry reacted by proposing in July 1969 to voluntarily remove its commercial advertising from the broadcast media by September 1970. Shortly thereafter the Congress enacted a ban on cigarette advertising in broadcast media and in this way vacated the FCC proposed regulation.

The threat and reality of court tests have challenged and contained the FCC and FTC. Those agencies consequently asked Congress to take action ih order" to avoid the lengthy court teste which would inevitably result from an attempt to carry out their rulemaking approaches. The tobacco industry has used the threat of prolonged court tests as a means of successfully delaying and preventing the proposed regulations.

In volunteering to remove its advertising from broadcast media, the industry cited .two premises:  Truthful advertising is a basic commercial right, and smoking is an adult custom. While the industry denies the right of government to eliminate advertising, it consented to a broadcast blackout on the ground that it did not intend to appeal to a young audience.

Federal agencies with jurisdiction over interstate air and land travel have imposed segregation requirements pursuant to their rulemaking powers. The Federal Consumer product Safety Commission (FCPSC) has flirted with the idea of regulating cigarettes as a claimed fire .or health haaard,

All of these federal agencies were able to act as boldly as they have because their relative independence has protected them from economic and political pressures. For example, .by striking out at broad categories of action in trade regulation rule proposals instead of attacking specific ads which would be tied up in court tests, the FTC brought enormous publicity and public attention .to the question of cigarette smoking and health. The statutory independence of the federal agencies has permitted them to strike out repeatedly at the tobacco industry and create a generally threatening and uncertain future for It. .

Congress, on the other hand, has attempted to balance the economic concerns with the health concern in the cigarette smoking controversy. In passing the Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act of 1965 which required the statement of the Surgeon'General'6 warning on packaging, the Congress specifioally stated that it was preempting state regula* . tion in order to avoid "diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations. . ,".

In other words, the Surgeon General*s warning would be printed on packaging but for a period of time neither the federal agencies nor

the states could enter the field.



The anti-cigarette lobby has called the cigarette labeling act a victory for the tobacco industry. One critic entitled her article "The Quiet Victory of The Cigarette Lobby - How It Found The Best Filter Yet - Congress". Luther Terry, former U.S. Surgeon General, said "I would never infer that Congress intentionally perpetrated a hoax, but to my interpretation it turned out to be that, despite the good intentions of the Congress/' The bill prohibited for three years any requirements by any federal, state or local authorities that cigarette advertisements include the statement related to smoking and health. Until the act expired in 1969, the FTC and the FCC were prohibited from requiring health warnings in advertising.

The tobacco industry wanted to prevent the chaos of nonuniform state /"\   and local regulation such as affects the alcohol- industry. To gain one cruoiai cost-saving objective, uniform regulation, the industry compromised by adding a health warning to the cigarette package* Another critic noted that "the label wight even be a boon of sorts, providing a new defense for the industry" when new health suits were brought by persons claiming to have been Injured by cigarette smoking.

The broadcast ban which was enacted by Congress in 1969 called for the elimination of all TV .and radio cigarette advertising after January 1, 1971 as well as strengthening the cautionary statement. The bill extended the preemption of state and/or local health regulation until June 1971. The tobacco industry did not oppose the 1969 or the 1965 enactments which were in some ways victories.

Some Conclusions and Observations

mwnwi

The foregoing discussion illustrates that the federated nature of the U.S. political system and the fragmentation" of governmental authority and administrative responsibility are important in    g determining the type of governmental response.                                            **

The Congress is not staffed adequately nor is it properly structured to deal on a comprehensive basis with the medical aspects of the smoking controversy.

The independent regulatory bodies in the United States have been established to accomplish government regulation in technical areas. The FTC, FCC and FCPSC have been on very doubtful statutory ground in treating the smoking/health issue. They have been slowed by the limits in the procedures found in their statutory charter. As a--* result broad consideration of the smoking/health problem has been made difficult. Compared with public agencies in other countries they have been relatively free, however, to respond to the problem.

The FTC and FCC actions in this area'have been unexpebted and precedent setting. They have mainly stemmed from the efforts of individual personalties. While the agencies have taken a high profile attitude, they have not had the power to act on issues of this'type which lie outside their expertise and outside their legislative mandates. Congress has not extended their mandates to deal with the smoking/ * health problem and in fact has expressly prevented proposed agency actions from taking effect, In addition to the FTC, FCC and FCPSC the Departments of Agriculture, Treasury and Health, Education and Welfare have all dealt with portions of the total picture. A disjointed nature of governmental response has been augmented by the multiplicity of possible places where the action could occur.

Each agency is affected by interest group( pressures that oppose compromise and cooperation with its opponents. For example, U.S. tobacco price supports and export subsidies are two programs (the latter begun after the Surgeon General's Report) that have been criticized b,s being in direot conflict with the government's smoking and health program. Also in Britain the Exchequer has been notably reluctant to give up tobacco taxes from cigarette smokers.

The oversight by Congress of its departments is not effective in resolving differences between departments. Each pressure group struggles to define the issue in its own terms so.that the goals and actions of government will be congruent with its';desires. The  * Treasury has sought to collect revenues, Agriculture has .sought to maintain and increase employment, income and productivity of farmers while the health interests have sought to reduce disease. The antismoking forces were able to gain a foothold in the FAA, FCC and FTC and in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The fact that one hand of the government does.one thing and another hand does something quite different reflects the division of authority and responsibility which has made each agency vulnerable to the narrow interests of particular pressure groups*

Smoking and health as a political issue has been unpopular with all but a few politicians regardless of political party persuasions or . country. Hot only have strong economic interest, groups opposed government action but a substantial portion of adult population indulge in the habit and derive significant pleasure from the use of the product, While it is reasonable to assume that the public desires good health, it is not reasonable to assume that the public  at large and especially the oigarette smoking public is favorable toward antismoking measures that entail giving up the pleasures of smoking.

So far government efforts to regulate cigarette advertising have constituted the main thrust of government concern and the aggressive antismoking lobby is highly dissatisfied with the impact such efforts have had on total consumption. (The following page shows in chart-form the general, upward trend in cigarette sales but suggests a " * significant loss of volume due to political factors.) The reduction in cigarette advertising seems to have made the industry stronger economically, Profits have increasedr The ban on television and other broadcast advertising does not seem to have reduced consumption. The concomitant reduction in the number of anti-cigarette commercials  is considered to be a severe loss in the effort to keep public concern and awareness of the controversy at a fever pitch.

Like the meat industry and recently the automobile industry, tobacco^ products are now coming under close sorutiny and governments are;.-'.  ~ attempting to establish control over the products( as opposed to merely the advertising, to protect the public.

The warnings, the tar and nicotine ratings and the anti-cigarette commercials were all part of the effort to educate children and cigarette consumers not to smoke. Implicit in the policy of education is the idea that the consumers should make the basic decision and will make the "right" decision, provided they are given "more knowledge." In short, inform the public, and rely on an informed public to change the pattern of consumption. The government has not yet intervened directly to change the content of the product or limit its use. The protection of nonsmokers also has become an important and growing focus of the antismoking lobby with the announced purpose of making cigarette smoking an unacceptable social custom which they compare to spitting. At least 26 bills have been added to some 70 antismoking proposals in state legislatures for action in 1976, involving 26 states. Characteristically these measures would restrict the places where smoking may lawfully occur.      L

It is clear, however, that many anti-cigarette zealots and some public officials believe that the responsibility of the government does not end with merely warning the public of the hazards. They advocate direct intervention. Senators Kennedy and Hart recently proposed a health research bill to be'financed by a tax related to the tar and nicotine content of cigarettes. At about the same time, the British Minister of Health announced on*national television that he intended to lay an order before Parliament bringing additives and substitutes under the Medicines Act, which order must be approved by resolution of each House,

The tobacco industry, of course, would prefer no regulation at all. If there must be regulation, the Industry is probably better off to  have it at the federal level than be forced to fight off a multitude , of nonuniform regulatory efforts at the state, county and town levels. Even expanded regulatory efforts may be shaped by the industry to enhance stability in the market or by individual manufacturers to ~  bolster market positionsfor example, by capitalising on official^ tar and nicotine ratings in cigarette advertising.                                   5 .

Market conditions are important in determining company response* In  a rapidly changing cigarette market, it is difficult to obtain industry   cooperation because cooperation tends to affect individual firms

The purpose of this inejso is to outline jay vtew* as to how consumer attitude* toward nicotine will change la the near future. In order to explain change** t need to explain present attitudes toward nicotine*

Very tow consumers are aware of the effects of nicotine, ie it* addictive nature and that nicotine is a poison.  Most smokers view nicotine an the nunaber that follow* the 'tar* figure on cigarette pack*. Hardly any consumers use nicotine numbers as a baste for their purohaBo* Testa haw been conducted to detorjnlne the effect of including nicotine numbers In the advertising message* and in every case there ware adverse reaction* to the ads 

Consumer attitudes toward nicotine wilt not change too greatly in the near future. Information received from the Future* Group suggests that smokers will become aware of the benefit* of nicotine* Specifically, high nicotine levels cause cigarettes to taste hsrah (or full teate) and lower level* of nicotine give cigarettes a milder teste. Hence, nicotine level* should drop assuming the current trend toward "light" cigarettes continue* Nicotine Uvftiawitl not be a w^or factor In thtpurchaeo decision to the future, it in very unlikely that the govsrnmest will require a nicotine level to bo printed on cigarette packaging*

RE;          Nordine Study

.*'')

Host of the responses we (R&D, RJRT iind/or the tobaooo industry) should make to the publlo attitudes reported by Nordine are so obvious'that there is no point in my repeating them; e.g.,

-  Improve  soolal  acceptability,                                .                  .

-  Develop positive and refute any erroneous negatives In the smoking/health area.

-   Improve Company/industry Images.

-  Eta*<  eto.

Some other things, perhaps not quive so obvious, need consideration:

- The total market for olgarebtes Is projected to be essentially flat over the long term.

- About one-third of the adult ^ulatton is in that , market at,any given time,

- Koat of those who have sraoked fcr any signlfioant tine would like to stop. '

- Many, but not most, of'those who would like to stop smoking e>Ve able to do so*



Thus, the total (transient) market for oigarettoo is the result of a dynamic equilibrium, with abcut es many new smokers entering it as oonflrmed smokers leaving It.

- Any change at either ond (entij/oxit) of this equilibrium will change the position of the equilibrium, hence the sige of the market.

- Therefore, we need to foous riore effort on adult '?pro-Smokers and on confirmed smoker* who would like to stop smoking.

- To do this we need to know mt <:ti moro obout

o Why (sone) adults begin ic awoke.

o Why (most) smokers eontimv to smoke.

o Why the majority of confirmed smokers would like to stop smoking.

o Why some onfirmed smokers are able to stop smoking and others are not able.

o Positive/negatives associated with stopping smoking.

o State of the art, present/projected, of techniques for stopping smoking*

With sufficient knowledge/information, we should be able to maintain/increase the size of the total nsrket by influencing entry/ exit rates; and we should be able to improve our share of the market by targeting our products to the oruotal entry/exit groups at both ends of that total market* That assumes that the entry/ exit gates will remain substantially as they are now.

However* we oannot ever be comfortable selling a product-whioh most of pur oustomers would stop using if they oould* That is to say, if the exit gate from our market should suddenly open, we oould bo out of business almost overnight.

- Some slow but steady ."progress1* is being made ,Xn developing techniques for stopping smoking; but nd

, universal, easy method Is ye', in sight,

7 The probability of such a method appearing in the near term is small.

- The probability of suoh a method appeering over the long term approaches 100$.

- If/when that ooours. our opt torn tnolude:

()\o  Go out of business,

C^o  Find a way to eliminate the desire of smokers to stop smoking.

C*b Provide other produote, away from conventional cigarettes, whioh meet the same needs cigarettes now meet, but without the associated negatives.

- If, of the above alternative!, <1) is unacceptable* and (2) is not likely to be eohi*vAble, then we need to seriously consider (3).

o We need* to define the gratifications (social, psychological* physiological, oral, manipulative, visual, etc.) derived/expected from smoking of oonvetttional olgsrettotf,pgNbr=324
o Simplist!cully, we thon imed to dowlop and market other product* which would deliver these sane gratifications, without the negatives presently associated with smoking of conventional oigarettes.

o This will take much time and resources to implement.

o This is where our long ten* opportunity/survival lies.

o Ve need to get started.

Clearly, we will remain in tne conventions! oigarettes business as long as we oan, but I believe, in view of the Hordine study and other information, we n&ed to begin to very seriously think about where we go when/if that market disappears. There, .are some long tern, high risk/cost things that we need to address because,to repeat, we oannot be comfortable marketing a product which most of our customers would do without if they could.
