3         A.  My current title is senior

4   director, research and development.

5         Q.  You work within the research and

6   development department?

18         A.  I've worked in research and

19   development my entire career.  Right about

20   the time I joined the company, the research

21   department and the development department

22   were merging into one department, so that was

23   happening right about 1980, as I recall.  But

x                          n   J- c o *

5        Q.  Okay.  How many scientists?

6        A.  Quite a number of scientists.

7   Currently within R and D, we have about 180

8   to 200 employees, and we also contract with

9   many different types of individuals.  But

10   currently within the department, there would

11   be, as I said, 180 to 200 individuals, many

12   of those would be scientists, some would be

13   engineers, some would be technical personnel.

14        Q.  What is the percentage, to the best

15   of your understanding, as to the number of

16   scientists who are in the R and D department

17   of that 180 to 200 employees if you could

18   break it down?

19        A.  I don't know that I usually think

20   of it in terms of percentages, but I would

21   say the majority.

22        Q.  Okay.  The vast majority?

23        A.  I wouldn't probably characterize it

24   that way, I would say the majority.

3    I haven't looked at it in that way, as I said

4    a moment ago.

5         Q.  All right.

6         A.  But a significant number of

7    scientists.

8         Q.  All right.  Most of the employees

9    wh0 work within the R and D department of

10    that 180 to 200 employees are scientists?

11         A.  Yes.

12         Q.  Okay.  And are there any medical

13    doctors employed within that research and

14    development department?

15         A.  Not currently, no.

16         Q.  Since you've  since you have been

17    employed with the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

1   And I believe Dr. Benwan Shariff, I believe

2   was his name.  Those are the two that come to

3   mind.  There may have been others that I'm

4   unaware of.

5        Q.  And do you know what their medical

6   training was, do they specialize in any

7   particular field, do you know?

8        A.  I don't know their specialities.

9        Q.  Okay,  When did Dr. Eman work

10   within the R and D department, do you know?

11        A.  Dr. Eman would have worked within

12   the department about the 1990 time frame.

13   Probably 1990 to 1994, in that general area.

14        Q.  And Dr. Shariff?

15        A,  I believe that may have been in the

16   late '80's through the '90's.

17        Q.  And as  and did Dr.  strike

18   that.

21        A.  No.  I may or may not have his name

22   correct.  But, no, he did not.

23        Q.  But Dr. Eman did?

24        A.  He did, yes.

4   Reynolds took with respect to whether or not

5   there was proof sufficient to conclude that d       smoKing cigarettes causes lung cancer,

7   correct?

8        A.  I believe that he would have been

9   aware of much of the scientific literature

10   and  and a lot of different information.

11   He would have been aware of the company views

12   at that time, yes.

13        Q.  Okay.  Doctor, I'm going to ask you

14   to respond specifically to my questions,

15   because I didn't ask you about literature or

16   what was in the public.  I asked you about

17   the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company's public

18   position.  And I'm going  so I'm going to

19   ask you again.  Move to strike your last

20   answer.

21            When Dr. Eman was head of the R and

22   D department for the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

1   or not there was sufficient scientific

2   evidence to prove that smoking cigarettes

3   causes lung cancer?

4        A.  That was a very long question.

5            I don't know everything, obviously,

6   that Dr. Eman may or may not have been aware

7   of, but I think that he would have been

8   generally aware of the company's positions,

9   yes.

10        Q.  And would he, as the head of the

11   research and development, been part of the

13   public positions on whether or not there was

17        A.  Again, I don't know all of the

18   different things he was involved in.  I think

19   that he was the head of R and D and he would

20   have represented R and D views, he would have

21   represented the science and contributed in

22   whatever manner was appropriate.  I don't

23   know the specifics of that.

7        A,  I don't know his personal history

12   aware of who had medical degrees who worked

13   within the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

14        A.  No, not as employees of Reynolds.

15   There have been MD's that have been

17   example, to lead clinical studies, but not as

16        for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for

17        more than 30 years, and so in terms of

18        my  the aspects of my expertise, it

19        would come from my academic training,

20        from my experience in the industry, from

21        my interaction in scientific meetings,

22        from the research that I have conducted,

13        A.  Yes, other than prior to joining

14   the company, of course, I had academic

10   Reynolds?

11        A.  I'm not sure what you mean by that.

12            Extensive research into the

13   conduct?  My  my area of focus over many

14   years has been in the evaluation and the 

15   the development and  of products that have

16   the potential the reduce risks associated

5            THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure what you

7        has that been a specific research

8        project, that's not a specific research,

9        but it's something has happened during

11        company over the years.

12   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

13        Q.  In the connection with the work

14   that you do as a witness for Reynolds, R.J.

15   Reynolds in litigation, you have researched

16   internal business records, correct?

17        A.  No, I don't believe that I would

18   agree with that characterization.  I think

19   that I'm familiar with many of them.  I

20   haven't gone on a specific research mission

21   around anything particularly.

22        Q.  Okay.  Have you been provided

23   internal business records by attorneys

2        A.  In terms of preparing, I've read

3   many different documents, many documents are

4   ones that have been part of my work over the

5   years.  Some documents were brought to my

6   attention by attorneys and I reviewed them.

7        Q.  Okay.  My question was, Dr.

8   Borgerding, were you provided internal

9   business records by attorneys working for

10   R.J. Reynolds in connection with your

11   preparation to be a witness in litigation?

12        A.  By "internal business records,"

13   I'm  Ifm taking that to mean documents,

14   and  and yes, there have been some

15   documents that I have been provided as

16   something that may be of interest by

17   attorneys and there have been many that are

18   part of what I've looked at over the years.

19        Q.  How many documents have the

20   attorneys provided you, internal business

21   records, documents that are not made, you

22   know, public by R.J. Reynolds, internal

23   business records like memorandums, e-mails,

8   it's not 50 or I don't know if it's 50.

9        A.  I don't know the exact number as I lu       saiQ several answers ago.

1        Q.  Okay.

2        A.  But I don't know the exact number.

6   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

7        Q.  So the  so then would you say

8   that you have  how many  strike that.

9            How many internal business record

10   documents do you think that you have reviewed

11   over the 30-plus years you've worked at R.J.

12   Reynolds?

13        A.  I have no way to estimate that.

14   Many, many documents.

15        Q.  Thousands?

16        A.  I would say easily thousands, yes.

17        Q.  Okay.  So in terms of the records

18   that the attorneys provided you would be a

19   very tiny fraction of the records that you

20   would have reviewed during this 30-plus

21   years?

22        A.  I would think yes, that's  that's

23   true.  I have reviewed many documents over

24   the years and I don't know the exact number

25   that they may have provided.  But I would say

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

Page 30 I

1   it s tne smallest percentage.

2        Q.  And when was it that you first

3   started receiving documents from attorneys

4   for R.J. Reynolds to review in preparation

5   for your work as a witness in litigation?

6        A.  I don't recall the exact date.  I

7   don't know.

8        Q.  Would it have been in the decade of

9   1980?

10        A.  No, I don't believe there would

11   have been anything in the decade of 1980.

12        Q.  What about the decade of 1990?

15   time, yes.

16        Q.  What was the matter that you're

17   referring to?

18        A.  There was a case by the name of

19   Turner, so it was a state case in Illinois.

20        Q.  And you were listed as a witness in

21   that case?

22        A.  Yes.

23        Q.  Did you testify?

24        A.  By "testify," do you mean

25   deposition or trial?

1        Q.  Either.

2        A.  I did provide deposition testimony

3   in that case, yes.  I think that it would

4   have been in the early 2000's.

5        Q.  You have here April 16, 2003 and

6   August 15, 2003 for the Turner v. R.J.

7   Reynolds Tobacco Company.

8        A.  That seems quite reasonable, yes.

23   you've worked for R.J. Reynolds?

2        Q.  Is it more than 20?

3        A.  I don't believe so, no.

5        A.  I think probably so.  But, again,

6   I  I have never counted that up in that

7   way.  I don't know the exact number.

8        Q,  It could be 20?

9        A.  It could be 20.

10        Q.  It could be more than 20?

11        A.  Sir, when I tell you I don't recall

12   the number, that would mean it could be any

13   number that you'd like to throw out there.

14   It could be more, it could be less, it could

15   be that number.  I don't recall.  I've not

16   spent time with lots and lots of different

17   attorneys, but I haven't tried to count up

18   over the years.

19        Q.  In the last five years, how many

21   connection with your work as a witness in

22   litigation for R.J. Reynolds?

23        A.  Probably between five and ten.

1   preceding five years or were there any

2   different lawyers that you might have met

3   with?

4        A,  I think there would have been some

5   the same.  I don't  I'm trying to remember

6   the individuals that may have been involved

7   in that matter.  But I think general the same

8   ones.

9        Q.  Okay.  So it's the same -- it's the

10   identical five to ten for the past five years

11   and the five years before that?

12        A.  Yes.

13        Q.  Okay.  And how about the five years

14   before that, are there any different lawyers

15   you've met with in connection with your work

16   as an expert witness on behalf of R.J. 7       Reynolds?

18        A.  Let's see, the five years before

20        Q.  We're going  we're going 15 years

1       A.  Oh, gosh, I've probably known him

z       at least going on id years.

3        Q.  Okay.  And how many times do you

4   think you've met with him in connection with

5   your work as a witness in litigation over

6   those 15 years?

7        A.  I don't know the answer to that.

8        Q.  Could it be more than 20?

9        A.  Yes, I think it could be more than

10   20 over those years.

11        Q.  Would it be more than 50?

12        A.  More than 50?  It's  it's

19        A,  He works at Womble Carlyle

20   Sandridge & Rice.

22   in connection with your work as a witness in

1                     Q.     Okay.     And  

2        A.  Not quite as long probably.

3        Q.  The number of times you've worked

4   with Mr. Carter -- Kreiner rather, what would

5   you estimate that number to be?

6        A.  The number of times?  Again, I

7   think the -- the number of the times that I

8   was referring to before probably was

9   altogether.  So at  at some times I may

10   have met with Mr. Latham, at some times I may

11   have met with Mr. Kreiner, depending upon

12   what the matter might be.  There may have

13   been some times where they were there

14   toqether.

15        Q,  So the number is?

16        A.  The number for meeting with Mr.

17   Kreiner?  I don't know the number right off.

18   Again, quite a number of times over the

19   years.

20        Q.  More than 50?

21        A.  It's possible more than 50, yes.

3   met with her in connection with your work as

4   a witness in liticration

5        A.  Again, I don't know the exact

6   number.

7        Q.  Would it be more than 50?

8        A.  I've known her more recently, so

9   not as many times probably.  But it could

10   probably be at least tens of times.  I doubt

11   that it would approach 50.

12        Q.  Okay.  So something greater than 25

13   but less than 50?

14        A.  I don't know the answer, but

15   it's  it's possible it would be in the

5   through.

12   person by person, but at times in these

14   more than one attorney present.  So these

15   aren't independent or individual meetings.

1        Q.  Let me stop you there for a second.

2   Was Reynolds a defendant in a  in a

3   litigation in Canada?

5   not, no.

6        Q.  Okay.  Who was the defendant?

7        A.  That would have been RJR McDonald.

8        Q.  What's RJR McDonald's relationship

9   to R.J. Reynolds?

10        A.  At that time, it was part of a 

11   of our international company, so it was a 

12   a subsidiary of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

13   International at one point in time.  That

14   company was sold to Japan Tobacco

xo       international aoout tne year or zuuu, and as

16   part of the transition period there, I was

17   involved in some matters, and one thing that

18   they asked me to do was to testify.

19        Q.  What was the allegation against 

20   R.J. Reynolds McDonald?

21        A.  RJR McDonald.

22        Q.  Okay.  RJR McDonald.

1   around basically looking at various emissions

2   from cigarettes, so it was a very technical

3   case.  I provided testimony before trial in

4   that matter.  And after that, the province

5   decided to settle the matter.

6        Q.  Were you privy to the settlement

7   discussions and negotiations in that case?

8        A.  I was aware of the settlement

9   document, yes.

10        Q.  Okay.  But were you involved in 

11   in negotiating the settlement?

12        A.  I was not involved in that.  My

13   understanding is that was attorneys for the

14   province and for the parties.

16   think you worked with in -- in your work in

6        A.  Let's see.  There was also a

8   to as the Star litigation, and I don't recall

5            THE WITNESS:  I don't believe that

15   positions that you would like to make, but my

2   that he ascended to during his employment at

4        A.  I believe that his position towards

2   that are put into the R and D files as a

4   necessarily be to an individual.

5        Q.  All right.  So let's break that

6   down.  Now, you've seen hundreds of internal

7   memorandums created by individuals within the

8   research and development department at R.J.

9   Reynolds who have been addressed to other

10   individuals within the company, correct?

11        A.  I've 

12        Q.  Yes or no?

13        A.  Yes, I would characterize those as

14   interoffice communications, interoffice

15   memoranda.

16        Q.  Okay.  You've seen them, yes?

17        A.  I've seen many interoffice

18   memoranda, yes.

19        Q.  And then you're  the other side

20   of that is you're saying that  that

21   individuals within research and development

22   will also draft memorandums and that will go

23   into the research and development library?

2        A.  I'm sorry, your question wasn't

3   clear to me.

4            We have document retention

b       retention policies are, m part, reiateo to

8   retention policies that would just be in the

9   normal course of business, I think whatever

10   those are, they've been suspended for a long

11   time as we have been invoived in litigation.

12        Q.  What does that mean, "suspended"?

13        A.  It means that the ones that matter

14   are the ones that require us to retain all

15   the documents.

16        Q.  Who decides what matters?

17        A.  In legal matters, I would think it

18   would be our -- our legal counsel within the

19   company and  and those that would advise

20   them.

21        Q.  So the attorneys for R.J. Reynolds

22   who work within the company decide which

23   documents to throw out and which documents to

24   keep?

4   Reynolds has responded publically to the

5   Surgeon General's conclusions that cigarette

6   smoking causes lung cancer and other

7   diseases, that knowledge is something you

8   would have gained during your work at R.J.

9   Reynolds?

10        A.  I'm not sure exactly what that

11   means.

12            If I understand your question, I

13   had knowledge of Surgeon General and issues

14   around smoking and so on prior to coming to

15   Reynolds, and so I had impressions about

16   smoking, about the risks of smoking, about

17   the Surgeon General prior to joining

9        A.  Yes.  I'm going to try and answer

10   your question as best I can.

11        Q.  Well, you need to answer with a yes

12   or no and then you can explain.

13        A.  I don't know as far as agreeing

14   with the Surgeon General.  There have been

15   presentations on television by

16   representatives from Reynolds --

17        Q.  Then you don't know the answer to

18   my question.  If you're telling me that you

19   don't know if they've done that, then the

20   answer to my question is I don't know.

4        Q.  Do you know if  and I'm not

5   asking you what the position was, I'm just

6   asking you do you know if the R.J. Reynolds

7   Tobacco Company has used media formats like

8   T.V. interviews, national newspapers,

9   magazines to state publically what their

10   position was on whether or not there was

11   proof sufficient to conclude that smoking

12   cigarettes was the cause of any disease

13   including lung cancer?  My question is do you

14   know if over time they had used any of the

15   media formats to do that?

16        A.  I believe that they have from time

17   to time used various media formats to

18   communicate their understanding about

19   subjects like that, yes.

20        Q.  And have you seen  I'm just

21   asking if you've seen it, have you seen any

22   of those reproduced in any of the documents

3            I'm asking you if you were

4   convinced as of 1985 if cigarette smoking

6            MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

7            THE WITNESS:  In 1985, and even

8        prior to that time, I knew that it was a

9        risk.  I think that how those words are

10        used has -- has very important meaning.

11        So as you're asking me the question, I

12        believe the answer is no, but I can

13        explain why.

24        you posed the question, I believe the

25        answer is no.

2        Q.  Okay.  The Surgeon General

3   concluded in 1964 that smoking caused lung

4   cancer, correct?

6        Q.  If  if you think I'm wrong, then

7   just tell me I'm wrong, that's not what they

9        A.  That's not what they concluded

10   exactly, no.

13        Q.  Okay.  And as of 1964, did the R.J.

1   individuals.

2            Over time I believe that my views

3   probably evolved from there.  As of the

4   year -- in the '90's to 2000, there has been

5   a tremendous amount of science that's been

6   put forward around mechanism, that was put

7   forward in summary in the Surgeon General's

8   2010 report.  So my view has changed as

9   science has gone on.  My personal view has

10   always been that there's been a risk and that

11   there are probably a number of factors that Iz\       can contrioute and tnat smoicing is a very

13   important factor in that regard for some

14   individuals.

15        Q.  But you didn't -- you didn't go to

17   there's no reasonable conclusion that we

18   could draw other than cigarette smoking

19   causes lung cancer?

20        A.  Not in those words.  That's trying

21   to take a very complex SUDject and -- and

22   make it far -- far incomplete.  I mean, the

23   kinds of statements that you're putting

1    bright line where I asked myself and said on

2    this day, the words changed in some way.  I

3    think from the time that I joined the

4    company, I viewed that there was a risk

5    associated with smoking, that that was well

6    known.  I was taught that all throughout my

7    childhood.  And so the -- the time I've been

8    with the company, we have tried to understand

9    that.

10              The -- the key in terms of the

11    science is the science has continued to

12    evolve.  We now know the mechanism.  I don't

13    know the exact date.  Today my scientific

14    view is that cigarette smoking does cause

15    cancer in some individuals.  I recognize

16    fully that not everyone that smokes develops

17    lung cancer.  That's something that can't be

18    ignored as a scientist.  But for some

19    individuals, it can be the most important

14        A.  That's not what I'm saying.  What

15   I'm responding to is your question about the

16   general word "cause," and as I indicated in

17   answering an earlier question, the whole area

18   of smoking-related disease is quite complex.

19   And what we do know is that not everyone that

20   smokes develops smoking-related disease.

21        Q.  Okay.  But my question, though, is

22   there is a  a vast difference between

23   saying something may or may not be a risk

24   versus saying something causes a reaction,

25        correct?

2            THE WITNESS:  Again, I believe I've

3        answered that now several times.  Yes,

4        in one case it's about a possibility, a

5        plausibility, in the other it's about

6        understanding the actual underlying

7   and beliefs today, they're clearly

8   articulated.  I think our annual reports

10   approach.  And so as far as the words

2   smoking caused lung cancer and other fatal

4        A.  I believe in the 1990's, our Right

5   Decisions Right Now program would have come

6   about.  It's one that is focused on those

7   sorts of issues and those sorts of questions

8   and basically tried to make sure that young

9   people in their formative years in -- in a 10       certain age group prior to where generally

xx       consider trying cigarettes or tnmx. careruixy

12   about that and don't do it.

13        Q.  Okay.  So it's your testimony that

14   in the Right Decisions Right Now program,

15   R.J. Reynolds stated the position that

16   cigarette smoking was the cause of lung

17   cancer?

18        A.  I don't have the program memorized.

19   I don't know that those exact words would

20   have been there.  But I think that it's been

21   a program that's been around since, I

22   believe, the 1990's and it's one that has

23   always tried to stress the risks associated

24   with smoking and that it's not something that

25   anyone of that age should do.

1        Q.  Okay.  Well, let me just ask you                               f

2   this directly:  Is it R.J. Reynolds' position

3   that the health of the public has always been                      j

4   paramount to every other consideration?                                   f

7   things that we've worked to understand and to

8   provide products that reduce risks around the

9   diseases associated with smoking.

10        everything that could possibly be done

11        to try to understand what drives the

12        risks of smoking and to try and develop

13   be as simple as my product didn't taste good

15   of things that people may contact the company

1        Q.  Oh.  Well, you  you disagree with

3        A.  For a very important technical

5        Q.  Okay.  But when that information

9            MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

10            THE WITNESS:  I don't know what all

11        may have been going on there in terms of

12        the various things that had gone on in

14        that were available.

15            As far as that particular

16        statement, what I think they were left

17        with, ^n answer to your question, is

18        if -- if they were able to understand

19        the statement, was that there's no

20        single constituent in cigarette smoke

21        that's been shown to cause disease.

22        That's been something that's been

23        studied now for 50 to 60 years, and even

24        to this day, there are compounds that

2        you look at the 2010 Surgeon General's

9   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

10        Q.  Benzpyrene is a carcinogen, right?

11        A.  Benzopyrene unto itself is

12   carcinogenic in certain tests, yes.

13        Q.  Okay.  And as of 1972, was it

14   carcinogenic to humans?

15        A.  In -- at that point in time, I

16   don't know that it would have been classified i /       as carcinogen to numans.  it mignt nave oeen

18   an IR2B, in that scheme.  But it would have

19   been considered a carcinogen or a potential

20   human carcinogen.

21            But the key thing that must be

22   understood is that if all the Benzo(a)pyrene

1   are  some of those compounds are classified

5   a  is a different scientific question.

19   an element of tobacco or tobacco smoke,

21        they've issued -- I don't think they've

3        Q.  Okay.  And what was their

4   connection to the Surgeon General?

7   part of the federal government.

8        Q.  And is the Tobacco Institute

9   critical of the HEW?

6        Q.  Okay.  Then maybe you did

20   critical of the HEW in this press release in

1       the  truth."

2                           You   agreed  with  that   at   the   time,

3       correct?

4        A.  In terms what I believe that's

1       direction, yes.

8        Q.  Okay.  And "studies which conclude

9   that smoking causes disease have regularly

10   ignored significant evidence to the

11   contrary."

12            You  you agreed with that as well

13   at the time, too, correct?

14        A.  Yes, as I said, there -- there was

15   a lot of science and not all of it was

16   consistent in one direction.

17        Q.  And it was the position of the R.J.

18   Reynolds Tobacco Company at this time that

19   studies which conclude that smoking causes

20   disease have regularly ignored significant

21   evidence to the contrary, correct?

22        A.  Yes, I think, again, there was

23   science that clearly was not in agreement

24   with some of the prevailing views, and at

25   times, that was not given much weight.

	Q.  Well, R.J. Reynolds is -- is
	>

2
	referring to specific studies.  The studies
	|

3
	they're referring to are studies that
	|

4
	conclude that smoking causes disease, and
	I

5
	those studies have regularly ignored
	I

6
	significant evidence to the contrary.
	\

7
	That's what it says, correct?
	I

8
	A.  Yes, that's what it says.
	|

y
	Q.  And that was the position of the
	\

10
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, correct?
	|

11
	A.  Yes.
	i

12
	Q.  And that was your position as well,
	

13
	correct?
	j

14
	A.  Well, again, Mr. McPharlin, I'm not
	\

15
	sure I took a position as such, but if you're
	:

16
	asking what I believed at that point in time,
	j

17
	I believed, as I learned more about all the
	j

18
	science that existed, that there were clearly
	\

19
	some things that didn't add up.
	

20
	Q.  So 
	

21
	A.  And this is tryinq to communicate
	

22
	that, in my opinion.
	>

23
	Q.  Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
	I

24
	So looking back now, you agree that
	

25
	the studies which concluded smoking caused

1   disease as of that time had regularly ignored

2   significant evidence to the contrary?

3        A.  It would seem true, yes.

4        Q.  Okay.

5            (Whereupon, Plaintiffs' Exhibit 8

6        was marked for identification.)

7   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

8        Q.  You can put that away.  Thanks.

9        A.  Okay.

10        Q.  Plaintiffs' Exhibit 8.  (Handing.)

11        A.  Okay.

12        Q.  Okay.  It's  it's a similar

13   approach to the Plaintiffs' Exhibit 7 that we

14   just looked at a minute ago, right?

15            MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

16            THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure what you

17        mean by that,  I would view them quite

18        differently.

19   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

20        Q.  Okay.  In any event, I just want to

21   focus on some -- some of the statements in

22   the -- in the document.  Let's talk about

23   that.

1   you see that?

2        A.  I do.

3        Q.  Okay.  It was the position of R.J.

4   Reynolds Tobacco Company that the studies

5   which concluded that cigarette smoking was

6   the cause of -- of disease were based on

8       A.  I believe -- if you're referring to

10        Q.  I'm  I'm referring to the

11   position of the company at the time, too.

12        A.  Yes, I don't  I don't know if

13   they articulated that as a position, but they

14   recognized that there had been epidemiology

15   studies and that those are based on

16   statistical associations.

17        Q.  Right.  And that was the sum total

18   of the evidence, at least as far as R.J.

19   Reynolds believed, that was making a case

21   correct?

22        A.  I believe that's what was being put

23   forward.  All they're trying to do is

24   communicate what had been put forward.  Yes.

OBJECTION:

This interrogatory is overbroad and incapable of accurate response. It is overbroad because, at a minimum, the identification of every publication Plaintiff ever "read* is not calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. It is incapable of accurate response because no one, including the plaintiff, can recall every publication that he or she ever purchased, received, or read. Plaintiff will identify responsive publications that she can recall. However, her recollections are not necessarily complete.

18. INTERROGATORY NO. 18; State the brand names of all tobacco products you have ever used and identify the dates and length of time that you used each brand and product

ANSWER:

Plaintiff may not be able to remember every brand of cigarettes that she has ever smoked over the years. Additionally, it is difficult to remember the exact dates or length of time that she smoked certain brands. To the best of my ability, I recall smoking the following cigarette brands: Chesterfield, L&M, Eve, Marlboro, Winston, Salem, Benson & Hedges, Virginia Slims, Kool, Doral, and Newport.

Objection:

j

co

TO 0) CO

ANSWER:

Plaintiff is not a physician and is not medically trained and therefore, she is not in the best position to answer this interrogatory. However, Mrs. Whitney has lung cancer which was diagnosed in approximately 2009 and COPD/emphysema which was diagnosed in approximately 2008.

20. INTERROGATORYNO. 20: State all time periods during which you contend that you are or were a Florida citizen or resident, and for each time period, state your residence address, and all other facts which you rely to prove that you are or were a Florida citizen or resident

OBJECTION:

Plaintiff objects to the request for "all other facta" upon which she relies to prove she is or was a Florida citizen or resident as vague and overly broad. If by "facts" defendant is seeking to know periods of time, see response below. Otherwise, the request is vague and overly broad.

ANSWER:

See responses to Interrogatories 1 above. Among other facts, I have resided continuously in Florida from 1960 until the present time.

21. INTERROGATORY NO. 21: List each and every item of expense and/or damage you seek to recover in this lawsuit, including by not limited to (1) medical expenses, (2) pain and suffering, (3) lost earnings and state the amount you are claiming for each expense and/or damage; the facts that support each expense and/or damage; and the method you used in computing the amount of each expense and/or damage.

The interrogatory is vague and overly broad; seeks information from counsel which is protected by attorney client privilege or would fall under work product privilege; and improperly seeks to compel Plaintiff to provide the amount of money she will be seeking in pain and suffering.

ANSWER:

*

Discovery is ongoing related to Plaintiffs' economic losses and non-economic losses. Plaintiffs have not completed discovery regarding these harms and have not completed discovery regarding the conduct of the defendants.

22. INTERROGATORY NO. 22: Do you contend that you are/were addicted to cigarettes that contain nicotine?

and/or counselors who diagnosed you with addiction and who will testify that you are/were addicted to cigarettes that contain nicotine.

OBJECTIONS:

Plaintiff objects to this interrogatory in that it is vague and ambiguous. Additionally, the interrogatory seeks to invade Plaintiffs attorney client privilege and work product privilege by requesting counsel and plaintiff to identify specific information.

Trie fraud also concealed the true addictive nature of cigarettes.

trial by the plaintiffs. The fraud also concealed the true addictive nature of cigarettes. It was this belief that the dangers were merely unproven accusations and a highly controversial subject that directly impacted Karen Whitney. In addition, Karen Whitney was lead by the defendants to believe through marketing and advertising that filtered and light cigarettes were safer. Also, see Plaintiffs' depositions and expert depositions In this case. Also, as referenced above, the statements are too numerous to list making such statements unduly burdensome. The interrogatory is vague and ambiguous and seeks to invade Plaintiffs' work produd.

INTERROGATORY 2D. For each statement described in response to 2B, describe how you relied on that statement

Answer; The statements, including marketing, promotional and advertising statements, from the defendants and the cigarette industry, which created a false societal impression that the subject of cigarettes causing cancer and other serious health problems was a highly controversial subjed when in truth these defendants and the cigarette industry knew it was not controversial are too numerous to list in an interrogatory and constitute a large percentage the evidence that will be produced at trial by the plaintiffs. The fraud also concealed the true addictive nature of cigarettes. It was this belief that the dangers were merely unproven accusations and a highly controversial subject that directly Impacted Karen Whitney. In addition, Karen Whitney was lead by the defendants to believe through marketing and advertising that filtered and light cigarettes were safer. Also, see Plaintiffs' depositions and expert depositions in this case. Also, as referenced above, the statements are too numerous to list making such statements unduly burdensome.

3. Aff T9 A ClPlm For Fra^l fry Cpnesatmgnj

INTERROGATORY 3A. Do you contend that any defendant's concealment, omission, or failure to disdose material information or facts concerning the health effects and/or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes was a legal cause of injury or damage to you?

Answer: Yes

INTERROGATORY 3B. If your response to 3A is affirmative, describe each item of information or fact concealed, omitted or not disdosed by any defendant on which concealment, omission or failure to disclose you contend that you relied to your detriment

Answer: The information and facts concealed, omitted or not disclosed by the defendants as contained predominantly in the internal documents of the defendants, cigarette industry, and those companies associated with the defendants, are listed on Plaintiff's exhibit list, Plaintiffs' experts' reliance and discussed by Plaintiffs' experts. The truth of what the defendants knew and what they concealed that caused the false dganette controversy, induding what they knew about the true addictive nature of smoking, which Karen Whitney relied on caused her damages and the false sense of security created by filters and lights are described above in answer to 2E. Also, see Plaintiffs' depositions and expert depositions in this case.

INTERROGATORY 3C. For each item of information or fad identified in response to 3B, identify the time period during which you contend that any defendant concealed, omitted or failed to disclose that item of information or fad.

Answer: Approximately 1940s to 2008.

INTERROGATORY 3D, Describe how, for each item of information or fad identified in response to 3B, your knowledge of that item of information or fad would have prevented or lessened injury or damage to you.

Answer: Objedion, Plaintiff is not a medical expert or qualified to address this interrogatory from a standpoint of medical expertise regarding medical causation. However, without waiving said objection, Plaintiff states as follows: For decades, the defendants publicly denied that smoking was dangerous or proven to be harmful to health, informing the American public that smoking was acceptable. Defendants marketed their cigarettes on t.v., the movies, billboards, magazines, children's shows, family shows, game shows, sporting events including sports events for children and teenagers for decades representing to the public through this marketing and promotion that smoking was pleasurable, glamorous, safe, cool, acceptable and many other positive impressions. Defendants publicly denied health hazards of smoking and attacked the surgeon general and other public health agendes. The defendants marketing and advertising targeted children and teenagers like Karen Whitney and created a false impression that smoking was acceptable, and lights cigarettes were an acceptable alternative to non-light cigarettes. So, in general, if the defendants publicly admitted that which they knew to be true, instead of fraudulently concealing the truth,

Karen Whitney would have never started smoking, she would not have switched to light cigarettes believing them to be safer, and she would have sought more intensive medical assistance to get off her addiction to cigarettes. Additionally, she would not have gotten emphysema or lung cancer. See Plaintiffs' deposition.

18. INTERROGATORY NO. 18: Stale the brand names of all tobacco products you have eveT used and identify the dates and length of time that you used each brand and product.

ANSWER:

Plaintiff may not be able to remember every brand of cigarettes that she has ever smoked over the years. Additionally, it is difficult to remember that exact dates of length of time that she smoked certain brands. To the best of my ability, I recall smoking the Mowing cigarette brands: Chesterfield, L&M, Eve, Marlboro, Winston, Salem, Benson Sc Hedges, Virginia Slims, Kool, Doral, and Newport 1 smoked form approximately 1963 to 2008.

1962-1963       Marlboro & Winston (primary)

L&M (if couldn't get Marlboro or Winston) Benson & Hedges Chesterfield (a few packs)

OBJECTION:

Defendant fails to define numerous medical terms and therefore the interrogatory is vague and ambiguous,

ANSWER:

Plaintiff is not a physician and is not medically trained and therefore, she is not in the best position to answer this interrogatory. However, Mrs. Whitney has lung cancer which was diagnosed in approximately 2009 and COPD/cmphysema which was diagnosed in approximately 2008.

Diagnosis of COPD/emphysema:

I was admitted through the Emergency Room at North Florida Regional Hospital on April 6,2008 for tests doe to coughing up blood. As a result I was diagnosed with COPD/cmphysema. I do not recall the name of the doctor that informed me but it should be in the medical records previously provided.

Diagnosis of Lung Cancer:

5/8/09     coughed up blood (weekend) 5/11/09   went to primary care, Dr. Elizabeth Sanders . 5/18/09   Doctor's Imaging for chest x-ray 5/19/09   Doctor's Imaging for CT chest scan (showing mass) 5/20/09   sent me to Timothy Jones, M.D, - pulmonoiogist 5/22/09   Dr. Jones performed bronchoscopy at NFRMC (outpatient)* From

21. INTERROGATORY NO, 21: List each and every item of expense and/or damage you seek to recover in this lawsuit, including but not limited to (l) medical expenses, (2) pain and* suffering, (3) lost earnings and state the amount you are daiming for each expense? and/or damage; the facts that support each expense, and/or damage^ and the method you used in computing the amount of each expense and/or damage.

OBJECTION:

Toe interrogatory is vague and overly broad; seeks information from counsel which is protected by attorney client privilege or would fall under work product privilege; and improperly seeks to compel Plaintiff to provide the amount of money she will be seeking in pain and suffering.

ANSWER;                                                                                                                g

ro

Discovery is ongoing related to Plaintiffs' economic losses and non-economic losses. Plaintiffs have not completed discovery regarding these harms and have not completed discovery regarding the conduct of the defendants.

I stand by ray earlier response and my counsel's objection. I do anticipate bringing claims for both economic and non-economic damages, but no amounts have been determined at this time*

22. INTERROGATORY NO. 22: Do you contend that you are/were addicted to cigarettes that contained nicotine? If so, state all laets upon which you rely to support your contention that you are/were addicted to cigarettes that contain nicotine; and state the time period you are/were addicted to cigarettes that contain nicotine; state the names and addresses of the persons, including any physicians, Health Care Providers, and/or counselors who diagnosed you with addiction and who will testify that you are/were addicted to cigarettes that contain nicotine.

OBJECTIONS!

Plaintiff objects to this interrogatory in that it is vague and ambiguous. Additionally, the interrogatory seeks to.invade Plaintiffs attorney client privilege and work product privilege by requesting counsel and plaintiff to indentify information, Finally, this interrogatory can more reasonably be responded to via deposition testimony.

ANSWER; Yes.

Yes; for example, I tried quitting many times. I attended a stop-smoking clinic at Hialeah Hospital in the early 1970s. I tried hypnosis in the late 1970s m North Miami I tried using the nicotine gum, the patches, and Chantii. Although I was finally able to quit smoking cigarettes in 2008 with the assistance of the lozenges, 1 still use them after 3 years because of my intense

craving for cigarettes.

* 

Dr. Elizabeth Sanders prescribed the Chantix to see if that could help me stop smoking. 1 do not know if she "diagnosed" me with addiction.

I reserve the right to amend/supplement this and all of my interrogatory and supplemental interrogatory answers as discovery progresses.

Plaintiff alleges that she was exposed to Defendants' products as a smoker and/or

bystander.   Each exposure to such cigarette products of Defendants, caused Plaintiff to

inhale smoke from said products which caused Plaintiff to develop lung cancer, emphysema,

diseases to her respiratory system, In addition to other related physical conditions which

resulted in and directly caused her to suffer severe bodly Injuries. Each exposure to such

products was  harmful and  caused or contributed  substantially to the Plaintiffs

aforementioned injuries. Plaintiffs aforementioned Injuries arose out of, were connected to

and incidental to the design, manufacture, advertisement, marketing, distribution and/or

sale by Defendants of its cigarette products.

PlalnbYf was exposed to and did inhale smoke from cigarette products which were designed,

manufactured,  advertised,  marketed,  distributed  and/or sold  by  Defendants,  its

predecessors-ln-interes^ Its agents and/or alter ego,

The aforementioned damages of the Plaintiff are the direct and proximate cause of the

negligence of the Defendants, Its predecessors-ln-interest, its agents and/or alter ego in

that It produced, sold and otherwise placed Into the stream of Intrastate and Interstate

commerce, Marlboro, Benson & Hedges Menthol, Virginia Slim Menthol, Virginia Sflm

Menthol Light, Winston, Salem Menthol, Kool, Doral Menthol Light, and Eve cigarette

products which the Defendants knew, or, In the exerdse of ordinary care should have

known, were deleterious and highly harmful to Plaintiffs health and well being.   The

Defendants, prior to selling and/or distributing its cigarette products, to which Plaintiff was

exposed, knew that exposure to cigarette smoke was harmful to human beings and that It

could cause injuries including, but not limited to, emphysema, throat cancer, including

laryngeal cancer, lung cancer and/or other forms of cancer and/or result in death. The

Defendants also knew that Plaintiff and others similarly situated would use and be exposed

to Its dga/ette products In such a way as to cause Plaintiff to Inhale the smoke from said

products.

Defendants' cigarette products contained latent characteristics and/or latent functional

defects at the time they were manufactured and at the time Plaintiff was exposed to them

in that said products contained tar, nicotine and other harmful substances which

injuries including, but not limited to, emphysema, throat cancer, laryngeal cancer, lung                    ^

cancer and/or other forms of cancer and/or result in death, to those, such as the Plaintiff who used and/or was exposed to them.

Defendants knew that Its cigarette products would be used by and around Plaintiff without inspection for defects and that any such Inspection would not have advised Plaintiff of the fact that the Defendants' dgarette products could cause the injuries which she suffered. Such facts made Defendants' dgarette products inherently and unreasonably dangerous In that Plaintiff was not apprised of, could not and would not contemplate the danger and/or the extent of the danger of contracting the aforementioned injuries as a result of her exposure to the Inhalation of the dgarette smoke of Defendants' dgarette products which she used or was exposed to.

Plaintiff aBeges that there were methods of design and manufacture available and/or known to Defendants and unknown to the Plaintiff which could have been used by Defendants In the design and manufacture of Its dgarette products to which Plaintiff was exposed to make such products less dangerous.

b.    their failure to conduct adequate testing to determine whether dgarette smoking did lead to cancer and other diseases;

c.    the importance of animal experiments In determining the ability of cigarettes to cause disease in humans;

d.   the importance of epidemiological evidence in determining the ability of dgarettes to cause disease in humans;

e.    the addictive and dependence produdng nature of nicotine as contained in dgarette smoke;

f.    the risks of contracting cancer, Induding but not limited to lung cancer and throat cancer, from smoking dgarettes;

g.    the dose-response relationship between various carcinogenic substances contained in dgarette smoke and the risk of contracting cancer, Including but not limited to lung cancer an throat cancer;

h. that redudng the number of dgarettes smoked per day would greatly reduce the risk of contracting a dgarette related disease;

i. that smoking In excess of 5 cigarettes per day would likely lead to an addiction to or dependence on nicotine;

j, the use of ammonia technology and/or certain tobacco blends to boost the ph of the cigarette smoke so as to increase the ratio of the "free base" form of nicotine (which Is more easily absorbed by the smoker) to the add salt form of nicotine (which is less readily absorbed) so as to allow for greater absorption of nicotine by the smoker at lower levels of total dose;

k. the use of tobacco high In nitrosamines, a potent cardnogen not found in green tobacco leaf but created during the tobacco curing process;

I. the lack of credible scientific studies linking other human endeavors such as air pollution, viruses and/or road tar to the Increasing rate of lung cancer in this country;

m. tnat cessation of smoking, while reducing the risk of contracting certain dgarette related diseases, does not eliminate all risk;

n, that cigarette smoking permanently alters certain receptor dtes in the brain for nicotine making it more likely such individual will become or continue to be addicted to and/or dependent upon nicotine;

o. that use of mild tobaccos, re-constituted tobacco, tobacco casings and flavorants In the manufacture of Defendants' dgarettes led to a dgarette less likely to trigger the smoker's own biological self defense mechanisms, the smoke of which was easier to Inhale, Inhale more deeply and hold In the lungs for a longer period of time which resulted in Increased doses of cardnogens, such as PAHs and nitrosamines, and nicotine for the smoker even at lower levels of machine                  J]

q. that the carcinogens In cigarette smoke lead to the development of genetic mutations within the lungs of smokers making such smokers more likely to develop lung cancer when exposed to carcinogens, tumor promoters and/or tumor initiators induding but not limited to those such as PAHs and nitrosamines found within dgarette smoke.

51.      The dgarette manufacturers, induding Defendants herein, have concealed vast amounts of knowledge regarding the health hazards of cigarettes and their addictive nature over the course of the last 65 years. Plaintiff Is unable to allege in foil all such knowledge that the dgarette manufacturers and their co-conspirators, THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE, INC. ("TI") formed In 1958, TOBACCO INDUSTRY RESEARCH COMMITTEE ("TIRC) formed in 1954, and COUNCIL for TOBACCO RESEARCH ("CTR") formed in 1964 and previously known as the TIRC, have withheld and/or felled to release over the last almost 65 years both because she does not have access to this Information, and because to allege each and every such concealment of material fact herein would entail hundreds or even thousands of pages of pleadings; Indeed, it is the dgarette manufacturers themselves, induding Defendants herein, which have this knowledge and information, and are In the best position to know the contents of each and every such concealed fact.

52.      The dgarette manufacturers, induding Defendants herein, carried out their campaign of concealment by concealing and suppressing feds, information and knowledge about the health dangers of smoking, induding addiction. They concealed their actual knowledge concerning their own negative health and addiction research results and their manipulation and control of the nicotine content of their products to create and perpetuate smokers' addiction to dgarettes. The success of the conspiracy depended upon the concerted action

of the dgarette manufacturers (In a so-called "gentleman's agreement"), for otherwise the               cn

"Nl

cn

revelation by one company of what ft knew about the health consequences of smoking and/or the availability of a "safe'" or "safer" dgarette and/or the addictive nature of the manufacturers1 dgarette would have thwarted the conspiracy.

53.       In 1953 Dr. Ernst Wydner had published an artide titled Experimental Production of

Cardnoma with Cigarette Tar in the journal Cancer Research. In his experiments he painted

dgarette tar on the backs of mice which then developed tumors on their backs. In 1954

UGGETT & MEYERS, assuming that whatever cigarettes were used In Dr. Wydner's study

were not CHESTERFIELD or L & M, decided to repeat Dr. Wydner's experiments with their

dgarettes with, hopefully, better results. In a 1954 memo written by F. R. Darkls, an

executive for UGGETT & MEYERS, Mr. Darkis writes:

If Chesterfield turn out to be negative, and X (used by Wydner) as positive, It would then be possible to say, that by using Dr. Wydner's techniques, Chesterfield did not produce cancer in mice.

Of course when the experiments were finished ii 1955 the mice had developed tumors and so had rabbits that were similarly tested. The results of these experiments would not become public until many years later.

54.      A confidential limited14 LIGGETT & MEYERS document dated March 15,1961 states, In part (L6tM - A Perspective Review)

a.   There are biologically active materials present in cigarette smoke. These are a) cancer causing b) cancer produdng, c) poisonous...

b.   What the causative precursors In tobacco are Is not well known...So there is the suggestion of two mechanisms for causative agent products...but what good Is this? We've known this for several years - so what?

This document was written by an Industry consultant for UGGETT & MEYERS. This Industry consultant conducted animal research from 1954-1984 for UGGETT & MEYERS. This memo contained material facts known to and concealed by the Defendants since at least 1961 and unknown to the Plaintiff.                                                                                           *

55.      In 1964, the TIRC changed Its name to CTR and was joined by Defendant UGGETT & MYERS. Defendants, RJ, REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY, and PHIUP MORRIS USA, INC were founding members of the TIRC/CTR. The TIRC had been formed in 1954 with the pledge to provide aid and assistance to the research into all phases of cigarette use and health, expressly undertaking an interest in health as their basic responsibility paramount to

every other consideration thereby affirmatively assuming a duty to disdose any adverse                    S

56.       Despite their "promise" which purposely created the illusion that scientific research into the dangers of smoking was being conducted, the results of which would be made public, they concealed Information regarding the lack of bona fide research being done by the TIRC and CTTl into the health hazards of smoking, and the lack of funds being provided for research by the TIRC and CTR into the health hazards of dgarettes, which was the purported purpose for which the TIRC and CTR were established.

57.      Joint industry efforts undertaken by the TIRC and the CTR were neither disinterested nor

objective. Industry documents, recently revealed, show that CTR functioned not for the

promotion of scientific goals, but for the purposes of public relations, politics, and

positioning for litigation. The TIRC and CTR were used to support an Industry strategy of

denying or creating doubt that smoking causes disease. This material Information was

withheld from the Plaintiff and the public For example, in 1967, &F. Todd of the CTR wrote

a letter to Mr. Addison Yeaman. Mr. Yeaman was the vice president and general counsel of

BROWN 8t WILLIAMSON TOBACCO COMPANY. In his letter, Todd observed;

The only real difficulties that we encountered arose out of the unavoidable paradox at the center of our operations - namely that, on the one hand the manutacturers control TTRCs operations and do not accept that smoking has been proved to cause lung cancer while, on the other hand, TIRCs research program is based on the working hypothesis that this has been suffidently proved for research purposes. In addition, the Coundl senior scientists accept the causation theory...We have not yet found the best way .   of handling this paradox.

58.       In a July 17,1963 memo Addison Yeaman, vice president and general counsel of BROWN &

WILLIAMSON TOBACCO COMPANY and later president and CEO of the CTR writes:

The TIRC cannot, in my opinion, provide the vehide for such research (discover the cardnogens in dgarette smoke). It was conceived as a public

relations gesture and... It has functioned as a public "relations operation".



Clearly, despite what the Industry had publicly represented as being the purpose for which the TIRC and later CTR were formed industry Insiders knew ft was nothing more than a "public relations" sham.

59.       In that same July 17,1963 memo Addison Yeaman, vice president and general counsel of

BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO COMPANY and later president and CEO of the CTR

writes:

The 1964 Surgeon's General Report was not Issued for another 6 months. The 1964 Report did not have sufficient evidence to condude that nicotine was addictive but the cigarette industry certainly did. The Industry also understood what the findings of the Surgeon General would be regarding causation and disease even before those findings were made public Despite what the Industry told the public the Industry dearly understood that nicotine was addictive and cigarettes were a cause of lung cancer and other diseases

as to the health hazards of smoking and the addictive nature of smoking, through fraudulent statements, false statements and/or misrepresentations of material facts.

75* The dgarette manufecturers, including Defendants herein, made fiteraliy hundreds of misrepresentations to the Plaintiff and others similarly situated over the course of the last 50 years. Plaintiff Is unable to allege in full the thousands of pre-1%9 advertisements, and the continuing press releases, testimony by cigarette manufacturers' officers and employees before Congress and other governmental entitles, etc., that the dgarette manufacturers and their co-conspirators, THE TOBACCO INSTITUTE, INC ("11") formed in 1958, TOBACCO INDUSTRY RESEARCH COMMITTEE (TIRC) formed In 1954, and COUNCIL for TOBACCO RESEARCH fCTR") formed in 1964 and previously known as the TIRC, have prepared, participated in, given, and released over the last almost 50 years both because she does not have access to this information, and because to allege each and every such misrepresentation and/or false statement here would entail hundreds or even thousands of pages of ptead'ngs; indeed, It Is the dgarette manufacturers themselves, induding Defendants herein, which have this knowledge and information, and are In the best position to know the contents of each and every such misrepresentation and/or false statement.

76, The cigarette manufacturers, Induding Defendants herein, carried out their campaign of fraud, false statements and/or misrepresentations In at least five ways:

a.    they agreed falsely to represent to Plaintiff and others similarly situated that questions about smoking and health would be answered by an unbiased, and trustworthy source;

b.   they misrepresented and confuted the facts about the health dangers of smoking, Induding addiction. The dgarette manufedurers claimed, falsely, that there Is Insufficient "objective" research to determine if dgarette smoking causes disease and that dgarettes are not addictive;

c.    the dgarette manufacturers, Induding Defendants herein, used lawyers to misdirect what purported to be objective scientific research, yet maintained to the Plaintiff and others similarly situated that such objective sdentific research was being cenduded and that the results of such research would be made public;

d.   to discourage meritorious litigation by plaintiffs injured due to cigarettes, they engaged in "scorched earth" litigation tactics in combination with suppressing and distorting evidence In order to protect the dgarette manufacturers, induding Defendants herein, existence and profits.

e.    by designing, selling and marketing so called *Ughf cigarettes as being substantially lower in tar and nicotine than regular, or non-light dgarettes and therefore healthier or safer for consumers. Defendants knew that the system to measure the tar and nicotine was neither a valid nor reliable way to measure the amount of tar and nicotine inhaled by an actual smoker, (^withstanding same,

the Defendants marketed their "Light* dgarettes to consumers as a safer                    3

-si

20                                                                                                     *

alternative. Defendant's manipulated the design of dgarettes to produce test results that were artificially low. Furthermore, Defendants knew that "Light" dgarette smokers may compensate to obtain the same level of tar or nicotine as non-light cigarettes either by taking more puffs on each cigarette, by taking larger, longer or deeper puffs, or by smoking more cigarettes.

The following allegations are a representative sample:

a. In a 1959 advertisement for LIGGETT & MEYERS Defendant made the following false and misleading statements and misrepresentations'.

...patented filtering process makes L & M truly tow In tar,

b. A confidential "limited" UGGETT & MEYERS document dated March 15, 1961 states, In part: (L&M - A Perspective Review)

There are biologically active materials present in cigarette smoke. These are a) cancer causing b) cancer producing, c) poisonous...

What the causative precursors In tobacco are Is not well known...So there is the suggestion of two mechanisms for causative agent products. ..but what good Is this? WeVe known this for several years - so what?

This document was written by an Industry consultant for LIGGETT & MEYERS. This industry consultant conducted animal research from 1954-1984. Despite this very dear and early acknowledgment of the health hazards of cigarette smoke Defendant continued to maintain that there was no proof that cigarettes caused cancer.

c In a 1962 advertisement for LIGGETT & MEYERS Defendant made the following false and misleading statements and misrepresentations:

There's more rich flavored leaf In L & M than even in some unfiltered dgarettes. And L & M*s filter Is the modern filter.

In 1961, the TIRC changed Its name to CTR and was joined by Defendant LIGGETT & MEYERS. * Defendant, RJ. REYNOLDS TOBACCO COMPANY and PHILIP MORRIS USA, INC were founding members of the TIRC In 1954. The TIRC, had been formed in 1954*with the pledge to provide aid and assistance to the research into all phases of cigarette use and health, expressly undertaking an Interest in health as their basic responsibility paramount to every other conskieration. At the same time, the cigarette manufacturers, Induding Defendants herein, continued to represent that there was no proof that dgarette smoking Is one of the causes or contributing factors to lung cancer, When they made these representations, the dgarette manufacturers, induding the Defendants herein, Intended                   2

that the public, Induding the Plaintiff, would both believe In and rely upon such pubBc announcements, and they knew or should have known that these pronouncements would permeate the public conscience and allow present and future smokers to believe that, despite what they may have heard elsewhere, the hazards of dgarette smoking had not been proven:

a.    In 1971, theTI,ln a press release stated:

Any organization in a position to apply resources in the search for those keys - and which falls to do so - will continue to be guilty of cruel neglect of those whom it pretends to serve.

b.    In 1982, TI published a pamphlet in which it wrote:

Since the first questions were raised about smoking as a possible health factor, the tobacco Industry has believed that the American people deserve objective, sdentific answers. The industry has committed itself to this task.

Cigarette manufacturers knew that cigarettes were dangerous and addictive It became the

practice, purpose and goal of the dgarette rranufecturers to question any sdentific research

which conduded that dgarettes were a health hazard. They did this through media

campaigns, mailings to doctors and other sdentific professionals and through testimony

before governmental bodies.

Joint industry efforts undertaken by the TIRC and the CTR were neither disinterested nor

objective. Industry documents, recently revealed, show that CTR functioned not for the

promotion of sdentific goals, but for the purposes of public relations, politics, and

positioning for litigation. The TIRC and CTR were used to support an Industry strategy of

denying or creating doubt that smoking causes disease. For example, in 1967, G.F. Todd of

the CTR wrote a letter to Mr. Addison Yeaman. Mr, Yeaman was the vice president and

general counsel of BROWN & WILLIAMSON TOBACCO COMPANY. In his letter, Todd

observed:

The only real difficulties that we encountered arose out of the unavoidable paradox at the center of our operations - namely that, on the one hand the manufacturers control TRCs operations and do not accept that smoking has been proved to cause lung cancer while, on the other hand, TRCs research program Is based on the working hypothesis that this has been sufficiently proved for research purposes. In addition, the Coundl senior sdentists accept the causation theory..,We have not yet found the best way of handling this paradox.

Cigarette manufacturers when sued denied that cigarettes were addictive and dalmed that smoking was a matter of free choice and that smokers could quit smoking if they so

22

wanted.

82.      Cigarette manufacturers dalmed attorney-client privilege to shield as many documents as possible from dlsdosure and destroyed and/or refused to produce documents related to health Issues and the plaintiffs' claims.

83.      Cigarette manufacturers when sued for smoking-related injuries, conducted the litigation in such a way as to cause the maximum expencSture of tine and resources by the claimant for the purposes of exhausting their adversaries1 resources and to discourage other meritorious litigation.

84.      The aforementioned acts, false statements and/or misrepresentations which were made and/or caused to be made by the dgarette manufacturers, induding Defendants herein, and their co-conspirators were made and/or caused to made with knowledge of their falsity and/or in reckless Disregard of the truth.

85.      The aforementioned acts, false statements and/or misrepresentations were made and/or caused to be made by the cigarette manufacturers, induding Defendants herein, and their co-conspirators for the purposes of Indudng the Plaintiff and others similarly situated to rely on such false statements and/or misrepresentations so as to Induce persons such as the Plaintiff to smoke, fail to quit or reduce consumption.

86.      The aforementioned acts, false statements and/or misrepresentations which were made and/or caused to be made by the cigarette manufacturers, including Defendants herein, and their co-conspirators were justifiably relied upon by the Plaintiff, resulted In Plaintiff bdng unaware of the extent of the danger of the Defendants' cigarette products, the addictive nature of Defendants' dgarette products, and that low tar, low nicotine and/or filtered dgarettes were just as dangerous as regular and/or unfiJtered dgarettes. Such acts, false statements and/or misrepresentations were made by the Defendants who had knowledge superior to the Plaintiff regarding the health aspects of dgarettes including their addictive nature,   

87.      As a direct and proximate result of the aforementioned acts, felse statements and/or fraudulent misrepresentations which were made and/or caused to be made or concealed by the dgarette manufacturers, induding Defendants herein, and their co-conspirators, Plaintiff, KAREN WHITNEY, smoked and/or continued to smoke Defendants' dgarette products which caused her to develop injuries, including but not limited to lung cancer and emphysema, In addition to other related physical conditions which resulted In and directly

co

has been an Adjunct Professor of Chemistry at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

Dr. Borgerding has authored or co-authored more than 100 papers and presentations relating to cigarettes and cigarette smoke chemistry, the developmem and application of analytical methods for the investigation of tobacco smoke, mouth-level cigarette smoke exposure studies using yield-in-use measurement techniques, development of tobacco and cigarette smoke testing for regulatory purposes, and other cigarette product evaluation studies.

He has made scientific presentations to the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Texas Department of Health, Health Canada, the FTC, ISO, and the Provincial Government of British Columbia.

Subject Matter of Expert Testimony

Dr, Borgerding will testify that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with high quality scientific staff, engineers and technical personnel. Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the research and development of cigarettes. Reynolds' scientists have been recognized for their expertise in identifying smoke constituents, quantifying yields of cigarette smoke constituents, reducing smoke constituent yields, and commercializing cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has earnestly responded to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products based upon the extensive researcn conducted in Reynolds' laboratories. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking, diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields, and substantially added to the scientific literature via its own scientific research. He will testify about Reynolds' R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. He will testify about Reynolds' efforts to identify, develop, and implement cigarette designs that substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine-smoking methods, mouth-level exposure measures, and studies of biomarkers. Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has developed successful cigarette designs and technologies that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of thousands of individual chemical constituents. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds identified by various governmental and public health entities as known, probable, or possible carcinogens by the U.S. EPA, IARC, or the U.S. National Toxicology Program.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that, despite considerable technical obstacles, Reynolds has worked to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents associated with the increased risk of           cn

chronic diseases. He will testify about criteria for new tobacco product development, including           ^

ensuring that products do not introduce unintended consequences, finished products are consumer acceptable, technologies are feasible from a regulatory standpoint, and technologies are feasible from a manufacturing standpoint He will testify that over the years many market introductions by Reynolds and other cigarette manufacturers have achieved technical success in reducing smoke constituents but have failed to achieve widespread consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such products, including carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotinized" cigarettes, ultra-low yielding cigarettes, and tobacco-heating cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about cigarette test methods, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. It is Dr. Borgerding's opinion that Reynolds has not designed its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC or any other cigarette test method. Dr, Borgeiding will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and that the scientific and public health communities widely recognize that a broad range of smoking behaviors influence smoke yield and intake. He will testify that despite these variations, smokers of lower machine yield cigarettes, on average, receive less smoke than smokers of higher machine yield cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds1 efforts to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields were a key guiding principle in the development and execution of its product designs and product technologies over the course of many decades.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways; (1) general reduction and (2) selective reduction. In discussing general reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about the cigarette design techniques Reynolds has used to achieve smoke yield reductions, including: filtration; filter ventilation; high/increased porosity cigarette paper(s); cigarette paper burn promoters; expanded tobaccos; reconstituted tobaccos; reduced tobacco weight; cigarette rod length reduction; reduced cigarette density; and reduced rod circumference. He will testify that, at all times, Reynolds' cigarettes conformed to the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacture and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at giv.en standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields. Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies that are in use in the marketplace today. He will testify about the incorporation of general reduction technologies over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has modified its products in response to consumer demand for lower "tar"* products and government and public health authority recommendations for reducing "tar" and nicotine yields as a means of reducing the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify that the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds have substantially lowered machine-measured "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five X decades.    He will address the trade-ofls associated with implementing general reduction        3

technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing low "tar" and/or ultra low "tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Borgerding will also testify that general reduction techniques effectively reduce the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related to smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns and reduce the risks of cigarette smoking.

In discussing selective reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' work in identifying and quantifying the toxicants of interest, developing technologies to accomplish specific toxicant reductions, and developing products that are commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will testify that Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' development of innovative cigarette designs, including tobacco heating products such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also testify about innovations in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique.

Dr, Borgerding may testify about Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments on the development and evaluation of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no U.S. governmental authority has ever recommended, mandated, acknowledged, or identified any alternative cigarette design to reduce the risks associated with cigarette smoking. In an effort to potentially reduce the risks of smoking, the European Union requires all cigarette designs to yield no more than 10 mg "tar," 1 mg nicotine, and 10 mg CO, according to standard test procedures. Reynolds was a leader in technologies to develop cigarettes to achieve these mandated levels.

His testimony will describe Reynolds' product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Borgerding will also testify about studies in smokers sponsored by Reynolds, including yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients used in its cigarettes (website, governmental reporting, and publications) and stewardship of ingredients.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about allegations of nicotine manipulation through altered cigarette design. *He will testify that Reynolds has not altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will testify that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase "free nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using machine methods.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' corporate positions on smoking and health issues and statements about smoking and health issues on its website.

He has made scientific presentations to the National Academy of Sciences Institute of Medicine, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, the Texas Derailment of Health, Health Canada, the FTC, ISO, and the Provincial Government of British Columbia.

Subject Matter of Expert Testimony

Dr. Borgerding will testily that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with high quality scientific staff, engineers and technical personnel. Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the research and development of cigarettes. Reynolds' scientists have been recognized for their expertise in identifying smoke constituents, quantifying yields of cigarette smoke constituents, reducing smoke constituent yields, and commercializing cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has earnestly responded to smoking and health

concerns through the design and modification of its products based upon the extensive research

conducted in Reynolds* laboratories. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated

scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking, diligently monitored

the scientific literature in this and related fields, and substantially added to the scientific

literature via its own scientific research.   He will testify about Reynolds* R&D library and

present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. He will testify about

Reynolds' efforts to identify, develop, and implement cigarette designs that substantially reduce

smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine-smoking methods, mouth-level

exposure measures, and studies of biomarkers.  Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has

developed successful cigarette designs and technologies that achieve significant reductions in

smoke constituents. *

Dr. Borgerding will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of thousands of individual chemical constituents. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds identified by various governmental and public health entities as known, probable, or possible carcinogens by the U.S. EPA, IARC, or the U.S. National Toxicology Program.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that, despite considerable technical obstacles, Reynolds has worked to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents associated with the increased risk of           cn

chronic diseases. He will testify about criteria for new tobacco product development, including

co

-s|

ro

ensuring that products do not introduce unintended consequences, finished products are consumer acceptable, technologies are feasible from a regulatory standpoint, and technologies are feasible from a manufacturing standpoint He will testify that over the years many market introductions by Reynolds and other cigarette manufacturers have achieved technical success in reducing smoke constituents but have failed to achieve widespread consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such products, including carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotinized" cigarettes, ultra-low yielding cigarettes, and tobacco-heating cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about cigarette test methods, including the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC'*) method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and utar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation*1 as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. It is Dr. Borgerding's opinion that Reynolds has not designed its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC or any other cigarette test method, Dr. Borgerding will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, duplicate conditions of actual human smoking and that the scientific and public health communities widely recognize that a broad range of smoking behaviors influence smoke yield and intake. He will testify that despite these variations, smokers of lower machine yield cigarettes, on average, receive less smoke than smokers of higher machine yield cigarettes.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds* efforts to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields were a key guiding principle in the development and execution of its product designs and product technologies over the course of many decades.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways; (1) general reduction and (2) selective reduction. In discussing general reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about the cigarette design techniques Reynolds has used to achieve smoke yield reductions, including: filtration; filter ventilation; high/increased porosity cigarette paper(s); cigarette paper burn promoters; expanded tobaccos; reconstituted tobaccos; reduced tobacco weight; cigarette rod length reduction; reduced cigarette density; and reduced rod circumference. He will testify that, at all times, Reynolds' cigarettes conformed to the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacture and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at given standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields. Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies that are in use in the marketplace today. He will testify about the incorporation of general reduction technologies over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Borgerding will testify that Reynolds has modified its products in response to consumer demand for lower "tarm products and government and public health authority recommendations for reducing "tar" and nicotine yields as a means of reducing the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify that the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds have substantially lowered machine-measured "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five           

decades.    He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction           ^J

5

technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing low 4ltar" and/or ultra low 'tar'1 brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Borgerding will also testify that general reduction techniques effectively reduce the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related to smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns and reduce the risks of cigarette smoking.

In discussing selective reduction, Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' work in identifying and quantifying the toxicants of interest, developing technologies to accomplish specific toxicant reductions, and developing products that are commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will testify that Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years. Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds* development of innovative cigarette designs, including tobacco heating products such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also testify about innovations in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and Reynolds* efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments on the development and evaluation of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no U.S. governmental authority has ever recommended, mandated, acknowledged, or identified any alternative cigarette design to reduce the risks associated with cigarette smoking. In an effort to potentially reduce the risks of smoking, the European Union requires all cigarette designs to yield no more than 10 mg '"tar," 1 mg nicotine, and 10 mg CO, according to standard test procedures. Reynolds was a leader in technologies to develop cigarettes to achieve these mandated levels.

His testimony will describe Reynolds* product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Borgerding will also testify about studies in smokers sponsored by Reynolds, including yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients used in its cigarettes (website, governmental reporting, and publications) and stewardship of ingredients.

Dr. Borgerding may testify about allegations of nicotine manipulation through altered cigarette design. 'He will testify that Reynolds has not altered pH or the amount of "tree" nicotine or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will testify that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase "free nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using machine methods.

Dr. Borgerding will testify about Reynolds' corporate positions on smoking and health issues and statements about smoking and health issues on its website.

Summary Of Opinions And Testimony

Dr. Cook's expert testimony will include the subjects of American and B&W s historical research and testing related to cigarettes and smoking and health, including internal research, funding of external research, and contributions to the published literature; American and B&W's efforts to develop cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks of smoking, including its efforts to respond to recommendations to reduce "tar" and nicotine; general and selective reduction of components of cigarette smoke; cigarette smoke chemistry; smoke pH; ammonia; nicotine and allegations of nicotine manipulation; alternative and novel cigarette designs by

American and B&W; the design of American and B&W cigarettes; the battery of tests used for American and B&W cigarettes; American and B&W's efforts to work with the public health community to reduce the inherent health risks of smoking, including work with the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group; use of ingredients and additives by American and B&W; the federal disclosure of the ingredients and additives used by American and B&W; American and B&W positions on smoking and health issues; company website content and information; American R&D*s library and document retention policies; B&W's R&D library and document retention policies; and any cigarette brands claimed to have been smoked in this case,

Dr. Cook will testify that for many decades, American and B&W were actively engaged in researching anti testing cigarettes and cigarette smoke, identifying and quantifying smoke constituents, atteiApting to reduce or eliminate certain smoke constituents, conducting and/or sponsoring biological testing of cigarettes and cigarette smoke, and developing and commercializing cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking. He will discuss American and B&W's responsiveness to smoking and health issues. He will testify that American and B&W monitored the scientific literature and diligently tested theories and claims for addressing the risks of smoking. Dr. Cook will discuss the approaches that American and B&W took to commercially implement cigarette designs that provided significant reductions in machine yields of many smoke constituents. He will discuss the work of American and B&W scientists who were pioneers in the field of cigarette design and each company's implementation of state of the art cigarette design technologies in their commercial cigarettes.

cn

Dr. Cook will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol composed of more than 5,000 individual chemical constituents. Cigarette smoke constituents are formed by the combustion and pyrolysis of the tobacco rod during smoking. Cigarette smoke contains many chemicals that have been classified by various governmental and public health authorities, including the International Agency for Research on Cancer, as carcinogens. Both American and B&W implemented cigarette design technologies that significantly reduced the standardized machine generated yields of these carcinogens in the smoke of their cigarettes.

Dr. Cook will opine that American and B&W's research efforts were focused on attempting to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents that were thought to be related to the risks of smoking. He will discuss how, in addition to the technical goal of reducing or eliminating cigarette smoke constituents including carcinogens in smoke, American and B&W cigarette designers had to simultaneously address manufacturing feasibility, regulatory feasibility, and consumer acceptability of the finished cigarette. He will address the problems encountered in various stages of product development and the trade-offs that American and B&W had to address among technical success, manufacturing feasibility, and consumer acceptance. He will testify that consumer acceptance is a significant factor in designing cigarettes with the potential to reduce the risks of smoking because regardless of the technical success of a new cigarette design, if consumers do not like the cigarette, it will not sell. Dr. Cook will address American and B&W's work over the decades to achieve both risk reduction and consumer acceptability. He will discuss various American and B&W products that were introduced in the marketplace that achieved technical success in reducing standardized machine generated smoke constituent yields but failed to achieve wide consumer acceptance. He may point to such examples as carbon-filtered cigarettes, tobacco heating cigarettes, and cigarettes with extremely low standardized machine generated yields of nicotine.

Dr. Cook will testify that American and B&W's historical cigarette design efforts to try to reduce the yields of constituents in smoke can be broken down into two broad categories: 1) general reduction; and 2) selective reduction. He will testify that general reduction technologies are designed to reduce "tar", nicotine, and all chemical constituents of smoke, including carcinogens. He will discuss that general reduction was an approach that was used extensively by American and B&W to dramatically reduce the standardized machine generated smoke yields of commercial cigarettes. He may testify regarding the following general reduction cigarette design techniques: filtration, reconstituted tobacco, expanded tobacco, reduced circumference, processed tobacco stems, filter ventilation, porous cigarette paper, and faster burning cigarette paper.



He may also testify regarding implementation of various general reduction techniques to

reduce utar" and nicotine yields in American and B&W cigarettes, including brand line extensions of many American and B&W brands, Dr, Cook will opine that at all times the cigarettes manufactured by American and B&W conformed with the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacture and used the best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at a given standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yield.

Dx. Cook will discuss the basis for developing lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes which included: (1) repeated calls for cigarette manufacturers to develop lower "tar" and nicotine             ^

cigarettes by the scientific community, as well as government and public health authorities; (2)             ^

Ol

encouragement for smokers to switch to lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes by government and public health authorities; (3) reported historical epidemiological studies finding that smokers of filtered cigarettes and/or lower "tar" and nicotine cigarettes had a lower risk of lung cancer than smokers of unfiltered and/or higher "tar" cigarettes; (4) the basic toxicological principles that the risk of any exposure to a chemical is related to dose and that efforts to reduce exposure to the constituents in smoke should result in lower risk of disease; (5) many studies in smokers reporting that, on average, smokers of lower standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine cigarettes get less smoke than smokers of higher standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine cigarettes; and (6) findings that general reduction techniques as implemented in commercial cigarettes resulted in a reduction of smoke constituents, including carcinogens, as measured by the standardized machine generated puffing conditions.

Dr. Cook will testify that as a result of the general reduction design changes, sales-weighted market average standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields have been reduced by nearly 60% from the early 1950s to today. He will testify that standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields in the early 1950s averaged about 38 mg and 2.8 mg per cigarette, respectively, while today the sales-weighted market average standardized machine generated yields are about 12 mg "tar" and 0.9 mg nicotine per cigarette. He will discuss how American and B&W provided consumers with products that span a wide range of standardized machine generated yields (including cigarettes with smoke yields so low they are difficult to measure) and how the lowest-yielding cigarettes are not consumer acceptable. With respect to these low yield products, he will be prepared to discuss smoker compensation. He will also testify that despite the consumer acceptance issue, American and B&W continued to research techniques for the general reduction of "tar" and nicotine.

Dr. Cook will testify that at the same time as they were exploring general reduction techniques, American and B&W were also researching approaches to selectively reduce certain constituents in cigarette smoke. He will discuss that selective reduction involves attempting to reduce the yields of specific chemicals in cigarette smoke. Dr. Cook will testify that to target the specific smoke constituents for reduction, American and B&W scientists studied iht scientific literature, Surgeon General's Reports, the International Agency of Research on Cancer lists of carcinogens, and recommendations by individual scientists such as Dietrich Hoffmann, among others. He may testify about research at both American and B&W regarding selective reduction techniques, including efforts to reduce the yields of various classes of chemical compounds in smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, and nitrosamines.

 Dr. Cook will testify that American and B&W designed cigarettes to meet consumer demand and to attempt to reduce the inherent health risks of smoking. He will discuss how, throughout the years, American and B&W explored a variety of novel and advanced cigarette and process development ideas that responded to recommendations in the scientific community. He may testify about American and B&W's research efforts on alternative or novel cigarette designs, including attempts to modify "tar/nicotine ratios in response to requests by members of the public health community, including the U.S. Surgeon General. As part of those efforts, Dr, Cook may discuss the National Cancer InstituteTobacco Working Group.

Dr. Cook will testify about American and B&W*s efforts to develop reduced risk            co

products and their efforts to achieve a consensus with government and public health           Zi

cn cn

communities regarding those products. He will discuss that a significant obstacle in the development of cigarettes with the potential to reduce risk is the absence of accepted standards for assessing potential risk reduction. He will testify that even today there is no consensus among the government, scientific, medical, and public health cornmunities about which test, or battery of tests, should be performed to determine whether one cigarette presents less risk, or is "safer," than another. He will discuss how in the absence of such a consensus, American and B&W conducted research on methods to assess its cigarettes and evaluated its products using those methods.

Dr. Cook will be prepared to address allegations regarding nicotine and nicotine manipulation. He may discuss such topics as smoke chemistry, smoke pH, the use and effect of ammonia in general and in American and B&W cigarettes, and the concept of free nicotine.

As a scientist at both American and B&W, Dr. Cook is prepared to testify regarding the R&D departments at American and B&W, including their libraries and document retention policies. He may testify regarding B&W's website. He may also offer testimony on the corporate positions of American and B&W regarding smoking and health issues. Dr. Cook may testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding American and B&W's cigarette research and design efforts.

Dr. Cook may also offer testimony on post-merger and current research activities of RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company. He may testify on related corporate entities including Targacept and Niconovum. Dr. Cook may also testify about certain factual financial information contained on the corporate website related to MSA payments, excise and sales taxes, manufacturer's cost, and profit per cigarette pack. He may offer testimony regarding regulatory issues and the Food and Drug Administration. He may also offer testimony in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits, and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Cook reserves the right to amend this disclosure.

Background and Qualifications

Dr. Figlar received a B.S. degree in Environmental Earth Science from Eastern Connecticut State University in 1989. He received both a M.S. and a Ph.D. in Inorganic Chemistry from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.   After completing his Ph.D. in            JJ

1997, he was awarded a National Science Foundation ("NSF") postdoctoral research fellowship            "^

Cn co

at Auburn University. As a NSF fellow at Auburn under the direction of Dr. David Stanbury, he studied the kinetics of various reactions related to the autocatalytic decay of chlorine dioxide. Dr. Figlar published several peer reviewed articles based on that research.

Dr. Figlar joined Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation ("B&W") in 1999 as an associate research chemist Upon the merger of B&W and Reynolds in 2004, he joined Reynolds as a Senior Director of Blend Development Technology. Dr, Figlar*s career in the cigarette manufacturing business has been spent in Applied Development with particular emphasis on the research and development of cigarette technologies to reduce the inherent risks associated with smoking. He has expertise in new cigarette technology, cigarette design; smoke chemistry; cigarette performance; filter additives; tobacco combustion; consumer testing; and commercial viability. Based upon his professional experience, education, training, knowledge of external and internal literature and personal interactions with other scientists, he is an expert in the areas of cigarette design, construction, evaluation, and performance. A copy of his curriculum vitae is attached.

Summary of Opinions

Dr. Figlar will testify that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with quality scientific staff, engineers, and technical personnel. Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the investigation of cigarettes, cigarette smoke, the identification and quantification of smoke constituents, the reduction of smoke constituents, and the commercialization of cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Figlar will discuss Reynolds' historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

It is Dr. Figlar's opinion that Reynolds has been earnest in responding to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking and has diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields while substantially adding to it via its own scientific research. He will testify regarding Reynolds' R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department. Dr. Figlar will discuss Reynolds* efforts to identify, develop and implement cigarette designs which substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine-smoking^ methods. Dr. Figlar will also discuss the many successful cigarette designs and technologies developed by Reynolds' scientists that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.                                                                                                       *

Dr. Figlar will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of more than 5,000 individual chemical constituents, the vast majority of which are formed naturally as a result of combustion and pyrolysis of the tobacco rod during smoking. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds that have been identified by various governmental and public health entities as carcinogenic. Dr. Figlar will address Reynolds* efforts throughout the decades to implement designs that significantly reduced the            ^

yields of carcinogens and toxicants in the smoke of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds            cj

does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking.  He will            --

cn

discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients and additives used in cigarettes on its website, and to the federal government, as well as the stewardship of those additives and ingredients. He will discuss the statements on smoking and health issues communicated on Reynolds' website.

It is Dr. Figlar's opinion that it has been Reynolds' long-time goal to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents that have been associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases. He will testify that based on the considerable technical obstacles of this goal, scientists and product developers must simultaneously ensure that technologies are feasible from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint and consumer acceptable when implemented in finished products. He will testify that in his experience, more often than not, problems occur in one or more of these areas and trade-offs between technical success and consumer acceptance must be weighed carefully. He will testify that over the years, numerous market introductions by Reynolds that achieved varying levels of technical success in smoke constituent reduction failed to achieve wide-reaching consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such commercial products, including, but not limited to, carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotinized" or ultra-low nicotine cigarette brands, as well as novel products such as Premier and Eclipse.

Dr. Figlar will testify regarding Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in its cigarettes, as well as its responses to public health concerns. He will testify that Reynolds' efforts to reduce 'tar" yields were a guiding principle in the development and execution of product and technologies over the course of many decades.

He may also testify regarding the FTC method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. Dr. Figlar will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, predict smoke intake for any individual smoker, He will discuss the wide recognition in the scientific and public health communities that there is a broad range of smoking behaviors that influence smoke yield and intake. He will note that despite these variations, on average, smokers of low yield cigarettes receive less smoke than those of higher yielding cigarettes. Dr, Figlar will testify that Reynolds does not design its cigarettes to circumvent the FTC method.

Dr. Figlar will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: 1) general reduction and 2) selective reduction. He will discuss the design techniques and technological advances used in general reduction by Reynolds and its domestic competitors that reduce the FTC "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarette smoke to reduce potential exposure to myriad chemical constituents. Hence, general reduction attempts to address risk as a whole, in reference to cigarette smoke, rather than targeting any single smoke component. In discussing general reduction, Dr. Figlar will testify that the cigarette design techniques utilized to reduce FTC smoke yield include: filtration, filter ventilation, high/increased porosity cigarette paper(s), cigarette paper bum promoters, expanded tobaccos, reconstituted tobaccos, reduced tobacco weight, cigarette rod length reduction, reduced cigarette density, and reduced rod circumference. Dr. Figlar will testify about the implementation of various general reduction techniques to reduce 'tar" and nicotine yields in Reynolds' cigarettes, including brand line extensions. He will testify that, at

15

all times, the cigarettes manufactured by Reynolds conformed with the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacturing and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at a standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yield.

He may testify regarding the development of specific technological advances used in general reduction, such as expanded tobacco, which was invented by Reynolds and first implemented in the marketplace in the 1960's as a design tool that enabled the development of cigarettes with lower tobacco weight because expanded tobacco reduces rod density. Dr. Figlar will discuss the reductions in FTC "tar" and nicotine yields that accompany expanded tobacco since the amount of tobacco burned is reduced.

Dr. Figlar will discuss the ways in which Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies and how these techniques are used in the marketplace today. In support of such testimony, he will cite to examples such as reconstituted tobacco, which was first used commercially by Reynolds and is now utilized by most tobacco companies globally. He will discuss how reconstituted tobacco inclusion reduces both FTC "tar" and nicotine yields, and the limits to the amount that can be utilized in cigarette manufacture due to consumer acceptability. In addition to discussing general reduction broadly, he will testify to the incorporation of these techniques over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case.

Dr. Figlar will discuss the modifications that Reynolds made to its products in response to greater consumer demand for lower "tar"' products, coupled with government and public health authorities advocating this approach as a means to reduce the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify how the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds and the domestic cigarette manufacturers have substantially lowered the FTC "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will testify that the sales-weighted FTC "tar" and nicotine yields per cigarette have fallen nearly 60% percent since the 1950's, from approximately 38 mg "tar" and 2.8 mg nicotine per cigarette to approximately 12 milligrams "tar*' and 0.9 mg nicotine today. He will address the trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing and launching low "tar" and/or ultra low "tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr. Figlar will also testify that general reduction decreases the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns. With respect to low tar products, he will also be prepared to address such topics as smoker compensation and Reynolds* research in this area.

Dr. Figlar will testify regarding Reynolds* efforts to address the public health concerns of smoking by means of selective reduction. He will explain Reynolds* work in identifying and quantifying the target compounds of interest and consequently developing technologies to expedite specific chemistry reduction and create products that were commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will also discuss the ways in which Reynolds has been a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years, including its historic and current efforts, technologies and products, such as carbon filtered cigarettes.

potential to address the risks associated with smoking with the development of "heat-not-bum" products, such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also discuss innovation in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique.

Dr. Figlar will testify that Reynolds cigarettes have been developed and manufactured with recognized state-of-the-art methodologies and practices at all times during the last six decades. He may testify about Reynolds' research efforts on alternative or novel cigarette designs, including attempts to modify "tar"/nicotine ratios in response to requests of members of the public health community, including the U.S. Surgeon General. As part of those efforts, he will discuss Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and others. He will also address Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments for the development of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no governmental authority, public health group, academic institution, scientific establishment or private entrepreneur has ever developed any superior alternative cigarette design, even though the subject has been extensively researched for decades.

Dr. Figlar will testify about Reynolds' efforts to develop novel products such as Premier and Eclipse, as well as its efforts to develop reduced risk products. He will discuss alternative cigarette designs and the lack of consensus among government, scientific, medical and public health communities as to which test, battery of tests or other evaluation approaches should be used to determine if one cigarette design may present less risk than another. He will testify and describe Reynolds' product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Figlar may also discuss studies in smokers by Reynolds, includmg yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

Dr. Figlar may testify regarding allegations of nicotine manipulation, He will be prepared to address the topics of smoke pH, "free" nicotine, and the use of ammonia. He will testify that Reynolds has not manipulated nicotine, altered pH or the amount of "free" nicotine, or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will opine that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase mainstream smoke pH or "free nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using the FTC method.

Dr. Figlar may testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding Reynolds' cigarette research and design efforts. He may also offer testimony in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Figlar reserves the right to amend this disclosure.

Dr. Garner is a Djplomate of the American Board of Toxicology and a Certified Industrial Hygienist. Attached is a copy of Dr. Garner's curriculum vitae. In addition to his responsibilities at Reynolds, Dr. Garner has authored or coauthored more than 50 scientific papers and presentations.

Subject Matter of Expert Testimony

Dr. Garner will testify that Brown & Williamson and The American Tobacco Company followed and contributed to the body of publicly available literature on smoking and health as it developed, worked to understand the relationship between smoke constituents and the health impact of smoking, evaluated and developed chemical and biological tools to measure the contents of smoke and the health effects of smoking, and changes to cigarette design that could reduce the health impact of smoking. Dr. Garner will testify that through research spanning many decades, American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson actively engaged in fundamental research to identify and quantify the constituents in cigarette smoke. He will testify that American Tobacco and Brown Sc Williamson followed the publicly available scientific literature on smoking and health. He will also discuss how American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson

20

attempted to reduce or eliminate certain constituents in smoke. In addition, Dr. Gamer will testify about the over 70% reduction in the tar and nicotine deliveries of commercially available cigarettes from the late 1950s to the present and that Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco provided their customers with a variety of products across a wide range of standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yields.

Dr. Garner will discuss the composition of cigarette smoke. More specifically, he will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol comprised of over 5,000 different chemical constituents. He will describe that most of these chemicals are formed during the pyrolysis of tobacco. He will also testify that approximately 60 of these compounds have been identified as being carcinogenic by one or more different government or public health groups. Dr. Gamer will further testify that American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson accomplished significant reductions in the yields of these carcinogens and toxicants in the smoke of their cigarettes through the implementation of various technologies. More specifically, Dr, Gamer will testify that for decades, American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson engaged in significant research to test and evaluate cigarette smoke, identify and quantify smoke constituents, work to reduce or eliminate certain smoke constituents, conduct or fund internal and external biological and chemical testing of cigarettes and their smoke, and work toward developing commercially viable reduced risk cigarettes.

Dr. Gamer will testify that the research efforts of American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson were directed toward attempting to reduce or eliminate certain smoke constituents thought to be related to the risks of smoking. He will generally discuss the different types of products developed, tested or introduced into the marketplace by American Tobacco and Brown Sc Williamson that achieved technical success in reducing standardized machine generated smoke constituent yields but were not consumer acceptable, including carbon-filtered cigarettes, low nicotine yield cigarettes, and tobacco heating cigarettes.

Dr. Garner will describe Reynolds* product stewardship program and its history and the current processes in place to ensure that new tobacco products or changes to existing tobacco products do not increase the inherent risks associated with tobacco use. He will also describe similar efforts employed by American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson to accomplish the same result He will also talk about the work done by Reynolds to develop new animal models and other predictive tests to assess the comparative toxicity of tobacco products for use in product stewardship.

* Dr. Garner will explain the reasons behind the development of lower *1arn and nicotine

cigarettes. First, ne will explain that guidance from the scientific and public health Community

and government authorities suggested that cigarette manufacturers develop lower "tar" and

nicotine yield cigarettes. Second, Dr. Garner will explain that the efforts of American Tobacco

and Brown & Williamson to achieve lower machine yield *1ar" and nicotine levels in their

cigarettes by utilizing different technologies accomplished significant reductions in these

measures. Dr, Garner will then explain that the body of epidemiological evidence suggested that

smokers of lower "tar" and nicotine yield cigarettes had a lower incidence of lung cancer than

smokers of higher yielding products. He will explain that the general reduction techniques used

by American Tobacco and Brown Sc Williamson in their cigarettes to reduce smoke constituents,          g

including carcinogens, resulted in lower machine yields in commercial cigarettes and that          ^J

21

smokers of these cigarettes have lower exposures to smoke constituents than do smokers of higher yielding products.

Dr, Gamer will describe the difference between general reduction and selective reduction of smoke constituents. He will testify that selective reduction is the effort to reduce or eliminate specific smoke constituents and about the efforts of Brown & Williamson and American Tobacco to selectively reduce certain of these constituents, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, aldehydes, and nitrosamines. Dr. Gamer will testify that American Tobacco's and Brown & Williamson's efforts to reduce certain classes of smoke constituents were largely guided by suggestions from leading scientists and public health authorities, including the Surgeon General and the International Agency of Research on Cancer.

Dr, Garner will discuss generally the standardized Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") method to measure the "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes and its historical function as a relative ranking of commercial cigarettes. Dr, Garner will testify that the FTC Method does not, and was never intended to, predict any individual's smoking behavior. He may also discuss the issue of smoker "compensation" generally.

Dr. Garner is prepared to discuss allegations regarding nicotine manipulation and the subjects of smoke pH and the use of ammonia in cigarettes.

Dr. Gamer will testify that there has never been a consensus as to what constitutes a safer cigarette. He will discuss how, despite this lack of consensus, American Tobacco and Brown & Williamson worked to develop cigarettes or novel products with reduced risk potential. Dr. Garner will also testify about Reynolds' work on products such as Premier and Eclipse, as well as Reynolds* own efforts to develop reduced risk products.

In addition to being prepared to testify about Reynolds' product stewardship program, Dr.

Garner may offer testimony concerning Reynolds' current positions on smoking and health,

statements on Reynolds' website, and Reynolds' efforts to develop smokeless tobacco products

and to migrate smokers to those products. He may also testify about corporate entities such as

Targacept and Niconovum, and certain publicly available financial information such as MSA

payments, excise and sales taxes, manufacturer's cost, and profit per cigarette pack.  He may

offer testimony regarding regulatory issues and the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Garner

may also testify in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits and other evidence offered by

Plaintiff at trial to the extent that it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Gamer reserves the right

to amend this disclosure. t

Summary of Opinions

Dr. Gentry will testify that Reynolds maintains a state-of-the-art Research and Development Department which employs and contracts with quality scientific staff, engineers, and technical personnel. Over many decades, Reynolds has been a scientific leader in the investigation of cigarettes, cigarette smoke, the identification and quantification of smoke constituents, the reduction of smoke constituents, and the commercialization of cigarettes with the potential to reduce the inherent risks associated with cigarette smoking. Dr. Gentry will discuss Reynolds' historic and current work in harm reduction and efforts to develop reduced risk products.

It is Dr. Gentry's opinion that Reynolds has been earnest in responding to smoking and health concerns through the design and modification of its products. He will testify that Reynolds has consistently investigated scientifically credible hypotheses intended to address the risks of smoking and has diligently monitored the scientific literature in this and related fields while substantially adding to it via its own scientific research. He will testify regarding Reynolds' R&D library and present and historical document retention policies in the R&D department, Dr. Gentry will discuss Reynolds' efforts to identify, develop and implement cigarette designs which substantially reduce smoke constituents as measured by standardized machine-smoking methods. Dr. Gentry will also discuss the many successful cigarette designs and technologies developed by Reynolds' scientists that achieve significant reductions in smoke constituents.

Dr. Gentry will testify that cigarette smoke is a complex aerosol mixture comprised of more than 5,000 individual chemical constituents, the vast majority of which are formed naturally as a result of combustion and pyrolysis of the tobacco rod during smoking. He will testify that cigarette smoke contains more than 80 chemical compounds that have been identified by various governmental and public health entities as carcinogenic. Dr. Gentry will address Reynolds' efforts throughout the decades to implement designs that significantly reduced the yields of carcinogens and toxicants in the smoke of its cigarettes. He will testify that Reynolds does not add ingredients to its products that increase the inherent risks of smoking. He will discuss Reynolds' disclosure of the ingredients and additives used in cigarettes on its website, and to the federal government, as well as the stewardship of those additives and ingredients. He will discuss the statements on smoking and health issues communicated on Reynolds' website.

It is Dr. Gentry's opinion that it has been Reynolds' long-time goal to reduce or eliminate          cn

specific smoke constituents that have been associated with the increased risk of chronic diseases.          g

24

He will testify that based on the considerable technical obstacles of this goal, scientists and product developers must simultaneously ensure that technologies are feasible from a manufacturing and regulatory standpoint and consumer acceptable when implemented in finished products. He will testify that in his experience, more often than not, problems occur in one or more of these areas and trade-offs between technical success and consumer acceptance must be weighed carefully. He will testify that over the years, numerous market introductions by Reynolds that achieved varying levels of technical success in smoke constituent reduction failed to achieve wide-reaching consumer acceptance. He will point to examples of such commercial products, including, but not limited to, carbon-filtered cigarettes, "denicotinized" or ultra-low nicotine cigarette brands, as well as novel products such as Premier and Eclipse.

Dr. Gentry will testify regarding Reynolds' efforts throughout the years to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in its cigarettes, as well as its responses to public health concerns. He will testify that Reynolds' efforts to reduce "tar" yields were a guiding principle in the development and execution of product and technologies over the course of many decades.

He may also testify regarding the FTC method, also known as the Cambridge Filter Pad method, which was the conventional means used to measure smoke yields and "tar" and nicotine from the 1960s through the 2000s. He will testify about various aspects of smoking behavior, including smoker "compensation" as it generally relates to machine-measured yields and their usefulness for relative rankings of commercial cigarettes. Dr. Gentry will testify that the FTC method does not, nor was it intended to, predict smoke intake for any individual smoker. He will discuss the wide recognition in the scientific and public health communities that there is a broad range of smoking behaviors that influence smoke yield and intake. He will note that despite these variations, on average, smokers of low yield cigarettes receive less smoke than those of higher yielding cigarettes. Dr. Gentry will testify that Reynolds does not design its cigarettes to circumvent the FfC method,

Dr. Gentry will testify that from a technology and product development perspective, Reynolds has sought to reduce toxicant exposure in two major ways: 1) general reduction and 2) selective reduction. He will discuss the design techniques and technological advances used in general reduction by Reynolds and its domestic competitors that reduce the FTC "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarette smoke to reduce potential exposure to myriad chemical constituents. Hence, general reduction attempts to address risk as a whole, in reference to cigarette smoke, rather than targeting any single smoke component. In discussing general reduction, Eh-. Gentry will testify that the cigarette design techniques utilized to reduce FTC smoke yield include: filtration, filter ventilation, high/increased porosity cigarette paper(s), cigarette paper burn promoters, expanded tobaccos, reconstituted tobaccos, reduced tobacco weight, cigarette rod length reduction, reduced cigarette density, and reduced rod ciicumference. Dr. Gentry will testify about the implementation of various general reduction techniques to reduce "tar" and nicotine yields in Reynolds' cigarettes, including brand line extensions, He will testify that, at all times, the cigarettes manufactured by Reynolds conformed with the generally recognized state-of-the-art in cigarette design and manufacturing and used best available technologies to achieve consumer acceptance at a standardized machine generated "tar" and nicotine yield.

He may testify regarding the development of specific technological advances used in general reduction, such as expanded tobacco, which was invented by Reynolds and first

cn

-a

ro

-si

o

implemented in the marketplace in the 1960's as a design tool that enabled the development of cigarettes with lower tobacco weight because expanded tobacco reduces rod density. Dr. Gentry will discuss the reductions in FTC "tar" and nicotine yields that accompany expanded tobacco since the amount of tobacco burned is reduced.

Dr. Gentry will discuss the ways in which Reynolds has pioneered many of the general reduction technologies and how these techniques are used in the marketplace today. In support of such testimony, he will cite to examples such as reconstituted tobacco, which was first used commercially by Reynolds and is now utilized by most tobacco companies globally. He will discuss how reconstituted tobacco inclusion reduces both FTC "tar" and nicotine yields, and the limits to the amount that can be utilized in cigarette manufacture due to consumer acceptability. In addition to discussing general reduction broadly, he will testify to the incorporation of these techniques over time in specific Reynolds cigarette brands, including those claimed to have been smoked in this case,

Dr. Gentry will discuss the modifications that Reynolds made to its products in response to greater consumer demand for lower "tar"* products, coupled with government and public health authorities advocating this approach as a means to reduce the risks of cigarette smoking. He will testify how the general reduction techniques used by Reynolds and the domestic cigarette manufacturers have substantially lowered the FTC "tar" and nicotine yields of cigarettes over the last five decades. He will testify that the sales-weighted FTC "tar" and nicotine yields per cigarette have fallen nearly 60% percent since the 1950's, from approximately 38 mg "tar" and 2,8 mg nicotine per cigarette to approximately 12 milligrams *tar" and 0.9 mg nicotine today. He will address tiie trade-offs associated with implementing general reduction technologies into commercial products and the efforts to continue to drive "tar" yields down by designing and launching low "tar" and/or ultra low "tar" brand style extensions to the parent brand. Dr, Gentry will also testify that general reduction decreases the yields of the majority of cigarette smoke constituents identified by public health authorities as related smoking and health issues. He will testify that the progressive reduction in smoke yields of commercial cigarettes represents a diligent effort on the part of Reynolds to respond to public health concerns. With respect to low tar products, he will also be prepared to address such topics as smoker compensation and Reynolds' research in this area.

Dr. Gentry will testify regarding Reynolds' efforts to address the public health concerns of smoking by means of selective reduction. He will explain Reynolds' work in identifying and quantifying the target compounds of interest and consequently developing technologies to expedite specific ^chemistry reduction and create products that were commercially feasible as well as consumer acceptable. He will also discuss the ways in which Reynolds has bden a leader in the commercial application of selective reduction techniques over the years, including its historic and current efforts, technologies and products, such as carbon filtered cigarettes. Dr. Gentry will testify about Reynolds' commitment to developing technologies and products with the potential to address the risks associated with smoking with the development of "heat-not-burn" products, such as Premier and Eclipse. He may also discuss innovation in smokeless tobacco as a harm reduction technique.

cn Dr. Gentry will testify that Reynolds cigarettes have been developed and manufactured            go

decades. He may testify about Reynolds' research efforts on alternative or novel cigarette designs, including attempts to modify "tar"micotine ratios in response to requests of members of the public health community, including the U.S. Surgeon General. As part of those efforts, he will discuss Reynolds' interactions with the public health community and government, including the National Cancer Institute-Tobacco Working Group and others. He will also address Reynolds' efforts to achieve consensus with the public health community and governments for the development of reduced risk products. He will discuss the fact that no governmental authority, public health group, academic institution, scientific establishment or private entrepreneur has ever developed any superior alternative cigarette design, even though the subject has been extensively researched for decades.

Dr. Gentry will testify about Reynolds' efforts to develop novel products such as Premier and Eclipse, as well as its efforts to develop reduced risk products. He will discuss alternative cigarette designs and the lack of consensus among government, scientific, medical and public health communities as to which test, battery of tests or other evaluation approaches should be used to determine if one cigarette design may present less risk than another. He will testify and describe Reynolds' product stewardship program and four-step scientific methodology. Dr. Gentry may also discuss studies in smokers by Reynolds, including yield-in-use and biomarker studies.

Dr. Gentry may testify regarding allegations of nicotine manipulation. He will be prepared to address the topics of smoke pH, 4tfree" nicotine, and the use of ammonia. He will testify that Reynolds has not manipulated nicotine, altered pH or the amount of ^ree" nicotine, or used ammonia for the purpose of addicting smokers. He will opine that research has shown that the use of ammonia compounds in commercial cigarettes does not increase mainstream smoke pH or "free nicotine," does not increase nicotine transfer rates, and does not influence the measurement of smoke nicotine using the FTC method.

Dr. Gentry may testify in response to Plaintiffs allegations regarding Reynolds' cigarette research and design efforts. He may also offer testimony in response to any testimony, opinions, exhibits and other evidence offered by Plaintiff at trial to the extent it relates to his areas of expertise. Dr. Gentry reserves the right to amend this disclosure.

The industry also supports research grants directed by the AniericBn t&dlcsl Association.

Ct-spHe all the research going on, lascttcal science has not found my conclusive evidence that an el&nont in tobacco or tobacco smoke causes any huuan disease,   The answers to the iiany unanswered smoking and health questionsand the true causes of human diseasescan, wa believe, be doteralned by scientific research*   Our Company intends, thereforet to continue to support such research until the truth is known,

Dear Mr. Bersinger;

The letters you and other members of your class wrote to various officials of our Company regarding a WINSTON ad,you saw in the Los Angeles Times have come to this department for reply. We appreciate the opportunity your letters give us to furnish you our viewpoint.

The primary objective of the entire R 0. Reynolds Tobacco Company advertising effort is to reach adult smokers. Hone of our cigarette advertising, either in its content or in the media used, is directed to youth. Provisions of the Cigarette Advertising Code, to which our company adheres, prohibit advertising that would have a high appeal to the youth of the nation.

The tobacco industry is most concerned about the charges being made that smoking is responsible for so many serious diseases. Long before the present criticism began, the tobacco industry, in a sincere attempt to determine what harmful effects, if any, snaking might have on human health, established The Council for Tobacco Research. The Industry also supports research grants directed by the American Medical Association.

Despite ill the research going on, medical science has not found any conclusive evidence that an element in tobacco or tobacco smoke causes any human disease. The answers to the many unanswered smoking and health ouestions-andthe true causes of human diseases-can, we believe, be determined by scientific research. Our Company intends, therefore, to continue to support such research until the truth is known.

I trust that these coiraaents and the enclosed materials will help you to understand our position on this matter.

Sincerely.

The issues that surround smoking am so complex, and so emotional, it's hard todehate themobjectively

In fact, many of you probably believe there is nothing to debate*

Over the years, you Ve heard so many negative leportsabcwt smoking and healthand so little to challenge these mportsttiat ywi may assume the case against smoking is closed*

But this is far from the truth.

Studies which conclude that smoking causes disease have regularly ignored significant evidence to the contrary Thesescientific findings come from research completely independent of the tobacco industry,

Wte at R J. Reynolds think you will findsuch evidence very interesting. Because we think reasonable people whoanalyze it may come tosee this issue not as a closed case, but as an open controversy.

Weknowsomeofyoumay be suspicious of what well say, simply because we're a cigarette company

We know some of you may question our motives.

But we also know that by keepings^ doubt and distrust. We may also have created the mistaken impression that we h^ nothing to say on these issues.

That is why weVe decided to speak out now, and why we intend to continue speaking out in the future.

During the coming months we will discuss a niimber of key questions relating to smoking and health. We will alsoexploie other important issues    . including relations between smokers and noivsmdcers, smd<ingamongour youth, and "passive smoking."

Some of the things we say rmy surprise you. Even the feet that we say them may prove contiwersial

But we won't shy away from the controversy because, quite frankly, that's our whole point

Wedon'tsay theieate no questions about smoking. Just the opposite. Wfesay there are lots of questionsbut, &

Like any controversy, this one has more than one side, Ws hope the debate will be an open one.

Do Statistics

f^tTflOpt A11\/ j |"| |*t*\Cfr

The Cffie^gainstsnwkin^is based alnwstexdtaiwly on statistics. That cs. on studies which show a sta> tistkat correlation between srnofc-tng and lurg career.

But a conefcjtioa does not prove that smoking b a <uy of tiiis disease. Because statistics simply cannot prove cause and effect.

This is not anoptiuon. Itsasci-entfclc principle that is universally accepted today. It was applied to siwkinK and health as br back as the Sta^eon General^ Report in

What!, more, many studies raise serious doubts about the supposed link between smoking and cancer.

For example: although the

UhitedStates and Canada rank first and second h the world tit cigarette consumption per capita, they rank only H)th and 16th, respecttvetjt in comparable death rates'&otniung cancer.

Another exanop!e:thejournal

oftheU-S. National CatKer Institute rccentlypubfehedastudy Deporting a^hcanttna3Eeiriiungcaricer anognH*soafcOT.^th^wt claim that smoking is the m^or cause of lung cancer, these findings arc difficult toexplam.

Equally perplexing is astuoV

AIso,!cseaid^ti!cogntze there aredin%entldffl&af!ti% cancer. Aik! although studies report that brta cancer ts now increasing in womea the particular type rojjottedlsnot usually associated with smoking. &j feet, the type that sgeneaUy lejxjrtetf tobe linked with smoking is net increasing,

^coddgooji-Bwtbepomt is, there is so much confltctingsta-tMca! evidence thatftcan he used to support almost any conclusion.

What About laboratory

Because statistics can ottiy point the way toward ftmherstudji many researchers have tamed to experiments tEsnig laboratory ananak

costiy twearch, not one of these smoke-inhalatiori experiments has ever pfodtioedthe kmgeancer it wasfookingibr.

In &a during 1980 the US. National Cancer Institute decided to terminate an experiment in which beagle dogs were made to whale item, whole cigarette smoke daily for several yeara. The study was cancelled earlier than planned becaiffie,aoconJJcg to a government spokesman, it wasobykfttsto the scientists that the dogs were not developingcancen (Three years tatetitnese findings have yet to he published.)

Other laboratory experiments have attempted to isolate the components of cigarette smoke.

But mower a quarter of a century noone hasever beenahle to identify an ingredient orgraupcf ingredients as found in cigarette smoke which causes cancer (or any other disease) in human*.

IsThera Another Exdanation?

If smoking dftiiV cause lung cancer, howetee could the statistical correlation be explained?

One theory that is gakung scientific support the so-called "constitutional hypothesis."

Briefly, this theory says that some people maybe bont with inherited tendencies that make them more i&dybothtoget king cancerand to engage in certain types of beiawincluding snwJdng,

The sitfotdng doesnt cause the disease; both the disease and the smoking are genKicaliyiniluertced.

In simple terms; kh not the

Finding the Answers.

As the respected scientist and pathologist; Dr Edwin Fisher* has pointed out, the problems involving stroking and health an? not "going to be solved by simple answers. They are compfocor they would already havebeensoivedr

The solutions arc golngto requite mote research. And nx>re patience,

The evidence ptesented here does not prove that smoking i$ harmless. But neither have our critics proven the opposite.

17            THE WITNESS:  I'm not sure which

18        research you're referring to.  This is

19        talking about a tremendous amount of

20        research that was being done by quite a

17   rephrase that and say, 30 years of research

18   about smoking and health has produced

19   scientific proof that tobacco causes disease,

20   you would disagree with that statement as of

2    and health has produced scientific proof that

4          A.  No, at that point in time, I don't

5    think that the 30 years -- 30 years in we had

6    the ultimate proof.

7          Q.  So you would have -- you would

8    disagree with that statement, correct?

10    work to be done, yes.

11          Q.  Okay.  And as of February 1984, the

12    research and development department of the

13    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company did not

14    disagree with the president and chief

15    executive officer of R.J. Reynolds, that as

16    of that date there was no scientific proof

21    research and development department of the

22    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company also agreed

1        Q.  Okay.  My question was did he

2   accurately and honestly portray the views of

3   the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company on the --

4   on that news program, Nightline?

5        A.  If -- if he was asked to do that, I

6   expect that he did, yes.  But I don't recall

7   if the questions that he received were about

8   his views or about the company's views or

9   both.  I would need to review it again and I

10   would expect that he would have put those

11   forward if they were asked for, yes.

12        Q.  You don't think he gave the

13   company's views about smoking and health?

14        A.  I -- I think it's entirely

15   possible.  I'd have to see it again.  There

16   were times where he was being asked his

17   opinion, in my recollection, and there were

18   probably times when he was being asked about

19   the company's views.

20        Q.  Okay.

21        A.  I think there was probably some of

22   both, but I would need to see.

23        Q.  Regardless of if he was being asked

1   be attributable to the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

2   Company?

3        A.  Again, I think the -- the

4   statements attributable to R.J. Reynolds

5   Tobacco Company are statements that R.J.

6   Reynolds Tobacco Company made.  As far as

7   statements that are made by a different

8   organization, they're made by that

9   organization.  If they're being made on

10   behalf of someone else, I think that that

11   would be communicated.

12            But clearly over the years,

13   Reynolds Tobacco Company has made many

14   statements, has put their views forward.  And

15   if there are times where someone else has put

16   forward views on their behalf, I would expect

17   that they would say.

18        Q.  But if it were, in fact, true that

19   the Tobacco Institute spoke on behalf of the

20   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company about issues

21   related to smoking and health, then that

22   would be a statement attributable to the

23   company, correct?

14        A.  It's not that I disagree with the

15   Surgeon General, but the most recent reports

16   from the FDA Center For Tobacco Products

17   would have a lower number than that.

18        Q.  Okay.  What's the number that

19   you're referring to?

20        A.  The number that I'm referring to

21   most recently, and, of course, that's not a

22   consistent number over the many years, but

23   most recently is about 380,000.

24        Q.  Okay.  So that's still  it's

25   fairly close to 12 million nevertheless,

12        A.  I don't know that I have a way to

3            THE WITNESS:  Again, I think I've

5        in those terms.  I don't know that

6        that's something that can be measured in

7        that way.

2        Q.  So when did filtered and/or light

3   cigarettes start saving lives?

4        A.  Again, as I've said a number of

5   times, that's -- that's not the way that I

6   would look at it and that that's not

7   something that can be quantified.  That's

8   sort of like in analytical chemistry

9   measuring nothing.  You can only measure

10   something.

11            In terms of risk, risk is something

12   that can be addressed and it's the metric

13   that's normally used, it's in widespread use

14   to understand the differences between

18            MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

19            THE WITNESS:  That's not a term

20        that I would normally use in that I view

21        the word "safe" to be something that is

22        an absolute, it means devoid of all

23        risk.  So there aren't degrees of that

24        absoluteness.

1        cigarettes would be looked at in terms

2        of greater or lesser amounts of risk.

3        If they're devoid of all risk, they

4        would be safe. 3       BY MR. McPHARLIN:

6        Q.  So it would be inappropriate to

7   look at a filtered or a light cigarette in

8   terms of whether or not that cigarette was

9   safer?

10        A.  Again, you would look at it in

11   terms of risk.  All would have some risk.

12   None would be safe, which means devoid of all 1 j   nsK 

14        Q.  Right.  So you wouldn't want to

15   use  you wouldn't want there to be a -- an

16   understanding that a light cigarette is

17   safer, as you just said, because that's not

18   true?

19        A.  No, I was trying to be precise in

20   terms.  Oftentimes some individuals will look

21   at the term "safer" to mean lower risk, but

22   I'm telling you my opinion.  My opinion is I

23   personally view the word "safe" as an

24   absolute condition.  "Safe" means devoid of                        I S

25        all  risk.

1            And that being said, if you try and

6        Q.  So the filter on a Winston

7   cigarette today, is it safer than the filter

8   that was on the Winston cigarette in 1954?

9        A.  Again, these are not  that's not

10   a metric, safer is not the appropriate metric

11   in my opinion.  If you're asking me are the

12   yields of the products of today lower than

13   the yields at that time and in part because

14   of the filter, the answer would be yes.

15        Q.  That's not what I asked you.

16            I asked you if a filtered cigarette

19        A.  A filtered cigarette today may

20   present less risk than a filtered cigarette

21   of that time, and if you're using the word

22   "safer" to mean of less risk, then the answer

23   would be yes.

24        Q.  So when did it become safer?

16   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

17        Q.  Okay.  You know that R.J. Reynolds

18   understands and has discussed in their

19   internal business records that people who

20   smoke light cigarettes can actually smoke

21   more than people who smoke regular cigarettes

22   because of the design of the cigarette,

23   correct?

2        Q.  Okay.  Well, let me ask you this

3   way*  R.J. Reynolds understands that people

4   who smoke filtered cigarette, because of

5   the -- the design of the cigarette, can smoke

6   more than a non-filtered cigarette?

8   smoke in a wide range of ways.  As  as far

9   as of the kinds of the cigarettes in the

10   past, the non-filtered cigarettes, for

11   example, the 1950's, they were very high

12   yielding cigarettes.  The non-filtered

13   cigarettes of today come down in yield

14   substantially, but I think the main

15   determinant of what someone yields from the

16   cigarette is their smoking behavior.  And for

17   any given cigarette, smoking the same

18   cigarette one day to the next, they can yield

19   more or less.

6   in the blood from low tar cigarettes by

7   longer puffs, bigger puffs, by more frequent

8   puffs and also by smoking more cigarettes

9   each day.  It has been observed that as one

10   switches from non-filter to a filer, one

11   smokes more cigarettes per day."

12            Did I read that correctly?

13        A.  I believe you did except for one

14        word.

15   puffs, bigger puffs, more frequent puffs and

17        A.  Yes, but he may just be referring

19   than something that was ultimately referred

20   to as a  a light cigarette.

21        Q.  Okay.

22        A.  So I'm just --

2   don't think he's talking about filtered

3   cigarettes then in the section that we just

4   discussed?

5        A.  Yes.  You  I was trying to

6   clarify, I believe that he is talking about

7   non-filtered versus filtered.

8        Q.  But you think in reference to

9   filtered cigarettes, he's referring to low

16        Q.  Correct, yeah.

17        A.  And I notice further in that

18   paragraph he's suggesting that surveys have

19   shown that when they do switch, they don't

20   necessarily increase the number of cigarettes

21   per day.

22        Q.  Right.  They may not increase the

23   actual number per day, but they actually

24   increase the amount of tobacco smoke they

25   take in per day?

2   until making that admission post 2000?

3        A.  I don't believe that it was post

4   2000 that those views were put forward.  It

5   would have been in that time frame.  But,

6   yes, as far as, for example, the mechanism of

7   cancer, if you look at chapter 5 of the 2010

8   Surgeon General's report, there are many of

9   hundreds of references there, the bulk of

10   those from the 1990's and early 2000's that

11   define that mechanism of -- of cancer

12   associated with tobacco use.

13            And so to answer your question, I

6   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

7        Q.  Does R.J, Reynolds have the ability

8   to put in the amount -- the level of nicotine

9   that they desire into a cigarette?

10       A.  They don't put nicotine into

A. A.            C-LyctJieL-L-co,      Lllfciy    JUU.L.     LUJJdLLU     111 Lu     Lv-LLJci-Lt^L-L-co.

12        Q.  Okay.  Does R.J. Reynolds have the

13   ability to maintain the level of nicotine in

14   the cigarette that they desire?

15        A.  Again, the -- a cigarette is

16   constructed based upon how much tobacco would

17   be in there.  In terms of the blend, it will

18   have a certain amount of nicotine.  The

19   nicotine in tobacco varies with time.

20   Generally tobaccos are blended and would be

21   relatively consistent, but it does change

22   over time.

23        Q.  Okay.  My question is, though,

24   can  does the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

25   have the technical ability to control the

United Reporting, Inc.

954-525-2221

Page 264

1   level of nicotine in a given cigarette brand?

2        A.  And, again, I'm taking your

3   question literally about nicotine, and that's

4   not that's something added or controlled.

5   What's controlled is the amount of tobacco,

6   the nature of the blend, the tar yield of the

7   cigarette.

8        Q.  So it's  it's your testimony that

9   in a Doral cigarette, for example, R.J.

10   Reynolds has no idea how much nicotine is

11   going to end up being in that cigarette once

12   that cigarette is manufactured?

13        A.  No, I think that they have, again,

14   a general idea in terms of how much nicotine

15   may be in the blend, how much tobacco could

17   yield spec, there is a tar yield spec.

18   Oftentimes, generally nicotine would track

19   tar.  But nicotine will be more variable

20   because it's a natural product.

21        Q.  Okay.  So it's your testimony that

22   R.J. Reynolds does not have the ability to

23   control how much nicotine remains in a

24   cigarette that they manufacture and sell?

25        A.  I'm sorry, that remains in the

2        Q.  Correct.

3        A.  I'm not sure what that means.

4   Again --

5        Q.  I'll break it down, then, for you,

6   Doctor,

7             When a cigarette is manufactured

8   and placed in line to be sold, it's ready to

9   be consumed by the public, correct?

10        A.  Yes.

11        Q.  Okay.  And when it's in that

12   position, ready to be consumed by the public,

13   it's going to have a certain amount of

14   nicotine in the cigarette, right?

15        A.  Generally, yes.

16        Q.  Okay.  So what I'm asking  what

17   I'm saying is what your testimony is, then,

18   is that R.J. Reynolds does  does not have

19   the ability to control the amount of nicotine

20   that is left in a cigarette as  when it 

21   when it is ready to be put on the market and

1   cigarettes are manufactured.  Cigarettes, as

2   I've indicated, are manufactured based upon a

3   tobacco blend, an amount of tobacco in the

4   cigarette, a -- so there are various weights.

5   And a -- generally we would have a tar yield

6   specification.

7            That being said, R.J. Reynolds

8   Tobacco Company recognizes a couple of

9   things.  One is that tobacco is a variable --

10   a natural product, it varies with time, so

11   those amounts can change somewhat.  And

12   secondly, we would know generally based upon

13   the blend and the amount of tobacco how much

14   nicotine would be in the cigarette, but

15   nicotine yield is not a specification for the

If                                  *                                  i......     Xm

17        Q.  So you don't  you don't indicate

18   how much nicotine is in the cigarette?

19        A.  Pardon?

20        Q.  You don't -- you don't specify the

21   amount of nicotine in the cigarette?

22        A.  No, that's not something that's

23   specified as far as  you mean on the

24   package or -- I'm not sure what your question

25       means.

3        A.  We would specify the composition of

4   the blend and then how much tobacco is in the

5   blend.  In terms of specifying the blend,

6   there may be measurements of the nicotine

7   that's present in the blend.

8        Q.  Okay.  So that's present in the

9   cigarette, right, that's what 

10        A.  Ultimately, all those things

11   together, we would have an understanding of

13   between 8 and 16 milligrams of nicotine,

14   depending upon how much tobacco is in a

15   cigarette.

16        Q.  And you can control the level of

17   nicotine that ultimately ends up in the

18   cigarette to the level that you want?

19        A.  Again, we would 

20        Q,  Based on whatever mechanism you

21   use, you can control the ultimate measurement

22   of how much nicotine remains in that

23   cigarette, correct?

2   it.  "Remain" means left behind to me.

3        Q.  "Remain" means what is in the

4   cigarette at the time that it's ready to be

6        A.  Again, given that, yes, we have a

8   cigarette.  We don't have a specification of

9   that as such, as I've said.

13        there that things that are drugs will

14        not be regulated by that center.  And so

1   a disease?

2        A.  The word "addiction" or the word

3   "addicted" -- "addictive" is used in many

4   ways in our society today.  But it would

5   depend upon how it's being used and who's

6   using it.  And there are many people that say

7   that you're addicted to all kinds of things

8   today, and they're not talking in a medical

9   way.  But medical professionals in that

10   particular area, some look at dependence,

11   some look at addiction.  I'm not sure of all

12   the details of that in terms of who does or

13   who doesn't.

14        Q.  Okay.  So you don't know if

15   addiction  nicotine addiction is a disease?

16        A.  As I've said, I believe that there

17   are some that consider it to be a disease, 1o       yes.

1        would agree with that statement.  Again,

2        I think that nicotine in cigarettes and

3        in cigarette smoke is addictive.  And

4        some people that smoke are addicted, but

5        not everyone that smokes is necessarily

6        addicted.

7            There are also, of course, many

8        individuals that use nicotine and they

9        don't smoke cigarettes.

1        Q.  And that sounds like nicotine is an

2   extremely important part of the reason why

3   people smoke, correct, according to Dr.

4   Teague?

5        A.  In tne mind or that individual at

6   that time, yes.

7        Q.  Plaintiffs' Exhibit 12.  (Handing.)

9   is, right?

1        Q.  Okay.  And this is -- this would be

2   a research and development related document,

3   correct?

4        A.  This would be an interoffice

5   memorandum, it would appear, it's not a --

6   what we would call an RDM, a research and

7   development memorandum.

8        Q.  Okay.  Is it between two

9   individuals within the research and

10   development department?

11        A.  I know that Dr. Di Marco was a

12   member of the department at that time.  And I

13   believe Dr. Teague was at that time, yes 

14        Q.  Yeah, look --

15        A.  -- but I'm not certain.

16        Q.  I'm sorry.  I was just going to

17   direct you to the first paragraph.  "Most of

18   our responses, we"  "most of the responses,

19   we" 

20        A.  Uh-huh.

21        Q.   "R & D, RJRT and/or the tobacco

22   industry," right?

23        A.  Uh^huh.

24        Q.  Okay.  "Should make to the public

25   attitudes reported by Nordine are so obvious

2            So he's reporting on the Nordine

4            Do you know who Nordine is?

5        A.  I don't right off, no.

8   perhaps not so obvious, need consideration,

9   and then he lists four -- four things in

10   bullets."

11            Do you see those?

12        A.  I do.

13        Q.  "The total market for cigarettes is

14   projected to be essentially flat over the

1   of it.

2        Q.  Okay.  And he's also talking within

3   this time frame, the time frame that you

6   correct, that's what he says?

7        A.  That's what he says here, yes.

8        Q.  Right.  Now, you know that the

9   scientists within the research and

10   development department at R.J. Reynolds at

11   this time were aware that the driving force

12   for cigarettes being addictive was nicotine,

13   right?

14            MR. LATHAM:  Objection to form.

15            THE WITNESS:  No.  Again, in terms

16        of my understanding at that time, I

17        mean, there are publications from the

18        scientists in the department and they

19        make clear their scientific views about

20        nicotine, about habituation, about

21        addiction.  I think that it's been known

22        for a long time that smoking can be

23        difficult to quit.  It's also been known

24        that many people quit smoking.  Some

25        have more difficulty than others.

14        Q.  Okay.  He states -- so you think

20        A.  Well, it could mean, for example,

22   the nail go into the wood.  The impact of the

3
	A.  The influence or effect could be
	

4
	the impact, yes, although I think within the
	

5
	context of tobacco and tobacco smoke, it
	

6
	would tend to refer to a physical sensation.

12
	right?
	

13
	A.  It could, yes.

	Q.  Referring to the -- what somebody
	

15
	feels from a cigarette as the kick, right,
	

16
	increasing the kick?
	

17
	A.  I don't know exactly what "kick"
	

18
	would mean.  I know that in terms of
	

19
	different studies, there will be an
	

20
	indication of how it feels in the mouth, how
	

21
	it mav feel in the throat, so it's actually a
	

22
	physical sensation, much like for -- I drink

2   from a cigarette, right?

3        A.  No, I don't believe that they have.

4   I think that they've reduced the yields of

5   nicotine over time.

6        Q.  And if  if they  the design of

7   the cigarette increases the nicotine effect

8   or kick, then that could make it a more

9   addictive product, correct?

10        A.  No, my current understanding is

11   there have been various theories about

12   nicotine, but currently, literature, even in

13   the last week, by tobacco control officials

14   have been focused upon this.  I think the

15   current question that's in the scientific

16   community is is there a level at which

17   cigarettes would not be addictive and what is

18   that, and it's about in that research about

19   amount, not about the form, which I think is

20   what your question is at least eluding to.

	Dr. Morse was the head of the              [

25  research
		\ and development department.  He            \

United Reporting, Inc.

Page 325

1   joined in 1980, I believe, and he would have

2   been there when the two departments were

3   merged.

4        Q.  And this is called, "Nicotine

5   Satisfaction"?

6        A.  The  the subject of the memo

7   is  is "weekly highlight," but it's got a

8   paragraph that has a heading, "Nicotine

9   Satisfaction."

11   to, the heading.

12            "Further analysis of data from

13   fuller-flavor low tar consumer satisfaction

14   study has revealed both an optimum and

15   minimum nicotine level required to maximize

16   smoking satisfaction.  As mentioned

17   previously, Camel Lights is in the optimum

18   range.  Merit 85 is just above the minimum."

20   knowledge of the -- the levels of nicotine

21   contained in those two cigarettes, correct?

22        A.  My impression would be that this

23   is  there -- there actually are very few

24   things to measure with the cigarette under

25   standardized conditions.  Tar and nicotine

CD United Reporting, Inc.

Page 326

1   yields are what were generally measured then.

2   I think that what it's doing is most likely,

3   and I'm speculating because there's not a lot

4   of information here, it's measuring tar and

5   nicotine yields versus as how well people

6   like the products and is looking based on

7   those machine yields at which products are of

8   a design that they like.

9        Q.  They're talking about the nicotine 10       level being within the optimum range.  That's ii       wnat ne says, rignt.

12        A.  Those are the words here.  I'm

13   giving you my understanding of how things

14   would have been done at this time in terms of

15   what kinds of tests would have run.

16        Q.  Right.

17        A.  So this isn't a level so much as a

18   standardized yield which is part of what

19   defines a -- a composition of a product, and

20   then there would have been testing to say, do

21   you like the product or not basically in

22   terms of panels.

23        Q.  Mr. -- do you know who D. H. Piehl

24        is?

25                    A.      I   do.

4        Q,  Scientist in R and D?

5        A.  He was at that time, yes.

6        Q.  Dr. Piehl is making a specific

7   reference to Camel Lights, correct?

8        A.  He is, yes.

9        Q.  And he's making a specific

11   Lights, correct?

12        A.  Again, I don't take this to mean

13   the level in the product, I take this to mean

14   the yield of the product under standardized

15   condition.  That's my understanding of the

16   document.

17        Q.  He says  well, let's just talk

18   about what he says.  He -- he uses the words

19   "optimum and minimum nicotine level required

20   to maximize smoking satisfaction," correct?

21        A.  Yes, he does.

22        Q.  Okay.  And then also talks about

23   the nicotine level being in the optimum

24   range, correct?

25        A.  He does, yes.

1        Q.  Okay.  The nicotine level being in

2   the optimum range, is it your testimony that

3   that was just pure happenstance?

4        A.  No, it's -- it's my testimony that D       it s well uriusrslooq tnat nicotine anct tnat

6   other secondary alkaloids, for example, that

7   are present in tobacco affect how it tastes.

9       is out of whack, smokers didn't like the way

10   they taste.  And the way that that was

12   knowledge, was to look at tar and nicotine

13   yields under standardized conditions based

15       with information from paneling that just

17   simple terms.

18        Q.  Okay.

19        A.  And so it was about the qualities

20   of the smoke, the smoke balance, how they

21   liked it or didn't like it.

22        Q.  So it's your testimony that in 

24   is referring to taste, correct?                                                  I g

1   think it's irresponsible for him to be

2   discussing activities that they have planned

3   that will hopefully reduce the trend of

4   losing 14 to 17 year old smokers?

5        A.  In -- in terms of this, I don't

6   know what activities they're referring to,

7   but what I do know is the  the ages for

8   smoking have changed over time, that the ages

9   where it's legal to smoke in various states

10   would have included the age of 17, for

11   example, for many, many years.  I know, for

12   example, where I grew up in Virginia, the age

13   was less than that.

14            So while it's not clear to me that

15   anything came of this, I don't know that it's

16   inappropriate to be discussing something

17   where it may be legal.  I know that we don't

18   market to anyone under age and that it's not

19   something that we do.

11   reduce the trend of losing 14 to 17 year old

12   smokers?

13        A.  Again, in light of today, this is

14   not something that would be done.  In terms

15   of the discussions that seem to have been had

16   at that point in time, it's several decades

17   ago.  The  the views of our society, the

18   laws in our country, state by state, were

19   quite different, and I don't know if it was

20   appropriate or not to discuss it.

21            I've never seen any indication that

22   it was acted upon.  This doesn't say that

23   things were actually done.  Today we would

24   not do that.

1    months away from the fall.  They have

5         A.  We've read through and I don't 

6    they've indicated here that they have planned

7    activities.  It doesn't say what those they

8    are.  It doesn't say that they've ever

9    happened.

15         Q.  Well, does it matter what

16    activities they have planned if the goal of

17    those activities is reduce the trend of

18    losing 14 to 17 year old smokers?

19         A.  Again, I would need to see what

20    they are.  I would think  this isn't

21    something we do today.  I've never seen any

22    indication that we've marketed to people

23    underage over all the years that I've been

24    there  been here at the company.  In light                           I co

1        Q.  But 

2        A.  What I'm here to do is tell you

3   that today we would not do such a thing.  I

6   particular report.

8   that this was incredibly irresponsible for

11   didn't -- that we stopped losing 14 year old

14   forward a legal definition, what I know is

15   there are inherent risks in terms of smoking,

16   and it's because when you burn tobacco, it's

17   a complex mixture that would include

18   toxicants.  I think that over time we've

1        question, it's around them making a

2        conscience decision around addiction as

3        such.  I think that what's been known

4        for many, many decades is that smoking

5        can be difficult to quit.  The

6        definition of addiction changed over /       time.  jKeports, tor example, in zuub

8        show that in the U.S., 50 percent of

9        smokers are dependent upon smoking

10        and -- and the nicotine therein and 50

11        percent are not.  And so it's a -- it's

12        much more complex than your question

13        would suggest.

3   for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to be

4   thinking of ways to make a filter look more

6   who smoke filtered cigarettes think that the

7   way it looks makes it more effective?

8        A.  I don't take this to be what you're

9   suggesting, which is that it's saying to not

10   have it actually show what it does, but it's

11   trying to find a way to communicate in very

20            That's what he said, right?

22        Q.  And you don't think that's wrong?

14   started manufacturing light  quote,

15   unquote, light cigarettes, it was not their

17   holes when smoking the cigarette, correct?

18        A.  I don't believe it was their

19   intention, I think that they recognized

20   people would smoke the cigarettes.  They were

21   trying to find different designs that would

22   reduce the yields of the cigarette and that,

23   along with other technologies, reduced

24        yields.

1        A.  That was one technology that did,

2   in combination with others.

3        Q.  But my question is, when they

4   designed this -- the filter, the light

5   cigarette and incorporated that design to

6   reduce the tar that the smoker gets, it

7   wasn't their intention that the smoker would

8   cover the vent holes with their mouth when

9   smoking or cover them with the fingers when

14   happens, correct?

22        Q.  Okay.  You don't think that even

3       A.  I would not agree with that, first

5   effect of ventilation.

6        Q.  So if they cover them and they're

7   not actually, in fact, ventilating the

8   cigarette, how do they not affect the

9   ventilation?

10        A.  They -- it may well affect the

11   ventilation, but, first of all, what happens

12   when you block some of the vent holes and you

13   draw air through the cigarette and you puff

14   on it, is you draw more air into the other

15   vent holes.  One thing that is often not well

16   understood is that it's very difficult to

17   block all of the vent holes.  And your

18   question seemed to suppose that all of vent

19   holes were blocked.  The science is

20   extensive, it's clear.  People smoke in a

21   range of ways.  When they smoke, some block

22   some of the vents some of the time with their

23   fingers or their lips.  When they do that, it

24   does no eliminate the effect of filter

25   ventilation in its entirety as well as that's

3        Q.  R.J. Reynolds was aware that

4   smokers covered the vent holes when they

5   would smoke light cigarettes, correct?

6        A.  Over a period of time, science in

7   that regard developed.  I'm not sure when

8   you're referring to or -- there was science

9   conducted over --

10        Q.  You knew it?

15   size of puff, what they do in terms of

16   ventilation and how much of the cigarette

17   they consume, that is, what the butt length

18   is, all of these are smoking behaviors that

19   are unique to an individual from one

20   cigarette to the next.

21        Q.  And did you change the vent holes?

22        A.  I don't understand what you mean by

23   that.

1        A.  There have been many different

2   cigarette designs and there have been various

3   degrees of ventilation, there's been

4   different kinds of filter designs.  So, yes,

5   I mean, those have changed over the years

6   quite a bit.

7        Q.  Filters also can produce fibers,

8   glass fibers; is that true?

9        A.  No, I don't believe that cigarette

10   filters produce glass fibers.

11        Q.  Okay.  No -- no cigarette filters

12   produce glass fibers?

13        A.  I don't believe so, no.

22   forward their views and their science in a

11        Q.  And for the past 60-plus years --

12        A.  If I may, what I would say is that

13   that doesn't mean that there can't be a range

14   of views within the scientists within the

15   organization at any point in time.  It's not

16   as though everyone has exactly the same view

17   at exactly at the same time.

18        Q,  So you agree that there were

19   scientists within R.J. Reynolds who had

20   concluded that smoking was addictive

21   internally, but the public position of the

22   company was that it was not proven to be

3   products with and without certain flavors in

4   terms of our product stewardship process, for

5   example.  But, no, I've not been a product

6   developer that's developed those types of

7   products.

8        Q.  Has R.J. Reynolds looked at

10   pina colada flavor?

11        A.  I believe there were a number of

12   products over time, that one may have had

13   such a name.  I don't know that the actual

14   taste of the product was like that.

25   products that had a range of flavors and that

4   thev were intended for that ouroose or that

5   that was something that was generally done.

6   I don't think they had a large market share

8        Q.  How about -- how about Camel No. 9,

9   was that a -- a product that was attractive

10   to teenagers?

11        A.  Again, that was a product that was

12   developed for adult smokers, it was one that

13   adult smokers said they wanted and it was one

14   that was smoked by adult smokers.  As far as

15   "attractive," I don't know what you mean

16   exactly.  If there were individuals that were

9        these may have been available were in

10        probably three venues that you had to be

15   BY MR. McPHARLIN:

16        Q.  What is Camel Crush?

17        A.  Camel Crush is Camel product.  It's

18   a product that has a certain type of filter

19   that when you push on the filter, you can

20   release menthol flavor.  So it's a -- a

21   cigarette that when you smoke it can be a

22   non-menthol cigarette or it could be a

23   menthol cigarette for some of the puffs or

24   all the puffs if  if the smoker prefers.

25        Q.  And you, what, you bite on it?

1        Q.  Okay.  Did you ever ask anybody if

2   Camel No. 9 was popular with teenage age

3   groups?

4        A.  It's my understanding from

5   documents that I've read that it would not

6   have been the -- the product that most may

7   have smoked.

8        Q.  That's not what I asked you.

9            I asked you if you ever went and

10   asked anybody in the company?

11        A.  I don't know with that specific

13   I'm aware of in terms of that type of

14   information.

15            MR. LATHAM:  Todd, we're at 5:17.

16        We're definitely not finishing today

17        because I'm going to have hours of

18        questions too, so do you want to

19        continue --

20            MR. McPHARLIN:  How much?

21            MR. LATHAM:  Hours.

22            MR. McPHARLIN:  Hours?

23            MR. LATHAM:  Uh-huh.  So do you

24        want to finish up tomorrow morning?  I

25        don't know how much you've got left, but

1        I don't -- I don't want Dr. Borgerding

2        to have to go well into the evening.

3            MR. McPHARLIN:  Okay.  Are we

4        stopping, is that what you're saying?

5            MR. LATHAM:  I'm asking you.  How

6        much you got -- how much do you have

7        left?

8            MR. McPHARLIN:  Well, I mean,

9        you're not going to finish today, right?

10            MR. LATHAM:  No way.

11            MR. McPHARLIN:  Then we'll finish

12        tomorrow.

13            We can go off the record.

14            THE VIDEOGRAPHER:  We re off the

15        record at 5:17.

16            (Whereupon, a discussion was held

17        off the record.)

18            MR. LATHAM:  We're going to go off

19        the record until tomorrow.  I think

20        we'll be able to start at 9.  Dr.

21        Borgerding is going to have to call his

22        office and just make sure his calendar

23        clear, people aren't waiting for him.

24        So I was going to suggest 9:30 to give

25        him time to do that.

Ad campaiqn calls for open debate

M#*|fcMMPMMMlMakliM



Throughout its 109-year history, RJ. Reynolds Tobacco Company has been a leader of Uie U.S. tobacco industry. That leadership has taken many forms  scientific developments, innovative products, advances in technology and many others.

In this leadership role, we have never hesitated when faced with a controversial problem, or when everyone else said something could not l>e done. If wc had, Mr, Reynolds would never liave produced Camel back in 1913 when a nationally advertised, blended cigarette was considered impossible by his competitors.

On Jan. 30, our company took on another tough Job, one I a m sure some people may consider difficult Through a national advertising program (pages 4-5), we began telling the American pubic that there are other points of view on the issues surrounding the use of tobacco products. We dared to challenge our critics who lve tried to make the public believe that the socalled case against tobacco is closed on issues such as youth smoking and smoking and health.

The fact ts that die questions trial have been raised about the use of tobacco products remain unanswered. For example, 30 years of research about smoking and health has pro duced no sdentific proof that jobacco causes disease. H has produced no scientific proof tl*al tobacco smoke ts harmful to nonsmokers.

What it lias produced are questions that must be answered through unbiased scientific research, the kind of research RJ. Reynolds and the tobacco industry have been funding for decades.

Unfortunately, many of tobacco's critics have not been wilting to let such research proceed in an orderly, unemotional environment Instead they preach an anti-tobacco gospel that portrays our company and industry as caring only about profit and callous about the welfare of the public. At the same time, they tave undertaken campaigns to make those who use tobacco products

'We believe the vast majority of the citizens of this country are willing to allow us to present our side of tobacco issues/

second-class citizens and social outcasts.

At R J. Reynolds Tobacco, wc believe that this type of anti-tobacco activism represents the views of only a small, but highty vocal, minority. We believe that the vast majority of the citizens of this country are willing to allow us to present our side of tobacco issues. We believe that they not only feel we have a right to present our story, but they want to hear it.

Through our new advertising program, wc will present a factual, unemo tional statement of our positions on many tobacco Issues and respond to

the charges that have been leveled against our company and industry. We believe that with such a program, we can help demonstrate that there can be an open debate about these Issues.

We believe that by not speaking out more strongly and more often In the past, we have talped foster pubfic misunderstanding about the facts regarding tobacco questions. We also believe that by allowing the public to hear our views, we will be allowing them to make truly informed decisions for themselves about the tobacco controversy.

We are aware Dial some of our views will be controversial, but a company that makes any valid claim to leadership of any industry must be willing to step forward when the need is dear.

Can we have anopendebate about smoking?

The issues that surround smoking are so complex, and so emotional, it's hard todcbatethcmobjectively.

In fact, many of you probably believe there is nothing to debate.

Over the years, you've heanj so many negative reports about smoking and healthand so little to challenge these reportsthat you may assume the case against smoking is closed.

But this is far from the truth

Studies which conclude that smoking causes disease have regularly ignored significant evidence to the contrary. These scientific findings come from research completely independent of the tobacco industry.

Vk at R J. Reynolds think you will find such evidence very interesting.                              ,

Because we think reasonable people who analyze it may come to see this issue not as a closed case, but as an open controversy.

We know some of you may be suspicious of what we'll say, simply because weVe a cigarette company.

We know some of you may question our motives.

But we also know that by keeping silent, we've contributed to this climate of doubt and distrust. We may also have created the mistaken impression that we have nothing to say on these issues.

Tiiat is why we Ve decided to speak out now, and why we intend to continue speakingoutinthe future.

During the coming months we will discuss a number of key questions relating to smol^ng and health. We will also explore other important issues      ? including relations between smokers and non-smokers, smoking among our youth, and "passive smoking."

Someof the things we say maysurprise you. Even the fact that we say them may prove controversial

But we won't shy away from the controversy because, quite frankly, that's our whole point.

We dont say there are no questionsabout smoking. Just the opposite. We say there are lots of questions-- but, as yet, no simple answers.

Uke any controversy this one has more than one side. We hope the debate                       2

will be an open one.

Ad campaign draws mixed reaction

"Thank goodness you arc finally going to fight back," wrote a woman f rorn Morganton, N.C

"I admire the motivation that brought it about," said a top executive at Reynolds Tobacco's fiercest rival,

"I think thl$ campaign Is sort of humorous,*' said an anti-smoking advocate.

Those were among the many reac-

tions to the company's Jan. 30 launch of a national advertising campaign presenting Reynolds Tobacco's position on various smoking Issues.

The woman in Morganton was among dozens of people from across the country who called or wrote the company during tiie first few days of the campaign. During the two weeks following the announcement, responses were running better than two to one In favor of the company's position.

One man tried to call Chairman EA Horrigan Jr. "to congratulate him and to pat him on the back" after his Feb. 3 appearance on the NI JC TodaQ show,

On Today, Horrigan told a national audience, "while there are studies that continue to statistically link us to the diseases tiiat we are accused of causing, there is also a significant body of science that says that the case against smoking Is still an open controversy. And these scientific submissions are, In fad, on file In Congress,"

The night t>eforc, Honigan appeared live on ABC's fiighUtne. a highly regarded national news program that devoted about twothfrds of Its one hour show to the issues addressed by the company's campaign.

During that broadcast, Horrigan debated John F. Barabaf III, the head of Action on Smoking and Health (ASH), an extremely vocal anti-smoking group. Joining Horrigan and Banzhaf was Dr.V1ncent Qulnee,a cancer specialist, who admitted that although he believes smoking causes cancer, neither he nor anyone else knows why many smokers do not get cancer.

Through both Interviews, Horrigan reiterated the campaign's premise  "that reasonable people who examine all the evidence concerning smoking and disease would agree this is an open scientific controversy, not a closed case."

Since its anrw>uncemeot, the company's action has attracted a great deal

While most of the reaction was supportive, as expected, spokesmen for various organizations that have traditionally taken anti-smoking stands condemned the campaign.

You thought the club was for engineers?

TlKJugh it has been in existence for more than half a century, the Reynolds Engineering Club remains unknown to most employees and a mystery to those who have heard of H.

""We've thought about changing our name, but we don't know wliat to call ourselves," says i itobby Brown, former president of the company's oldest club.

What many employees think of as a professional engineering organization Is realty a social club made up of more than 500 employees representing many positions and departments.

"We have members from all levels of the company, from management to air conditioning specialists to secretaries," says Peggy Boyles, the club's secretary. "And about 150 letirees are active as well."

The club was formed in 1930 by R.P. Recce, a chief engineer, "to benefit its members socially, morally, intellectually, physically and otherwise."

ItockfcwifawflmfagillM; says Vodie Gough, a retiree who joined in the mtd-30s and is still active at 85. "We didn't have many staff officers. "I hen we became more organized and began to have more activities."

Gough. who worked in the pipe and plumbing shop before he retired in 1966, doesn't take as many trips with the club as he used to. "But I attend most of the social fur>dion$r he says. "It gives me the opportunity to stay in touch with old friends, meet younger employees and learn about tiie company and what's going on."

Taking trips would be enough to keep members busy. Each year the

club sponsors about eight chartered trips. Last year, members enjoyed excursions to Pennsylvania Dutch Amish country, New York City, Washington, D.C, Atlantic Qty (for the Miss America pageant) and Charleston, S.C.

Plans this year call for trips to Disney World's Epcot Center. Nashville's Opry-land and the Workf s Fair in New Orleans.

"Most of these are two- or three-day trips, but we take others that are one-day excursions,** says Brown. "They include visits to places tike the Hot Air BaHoon Works at Love Valley near Statcsville, the Bihmore House and tours of such things as the Celanese Plant in Virginia, Reynolds Tobacco's Central Distribution Center and the Christmas Light Display in McAden-vUlc(N.C)r

Most of the chartered bus trips are open to members, their families and their guests.

Other activities include an annual barbecue, an Installation dinner, two golf tournaments each year and various seminars on topics such as finances.

r    BAY'S WORK

Back In the eany *40s, when the men went off to war, some 6 million American women moved from the home to the factory.

They became machinists, mechanics, plumbers, carpenters, welders, lumberjacks, blacksmiths. They did any job that needed to be done.

When the war ended, the men returned home. The women, for the most part, also went home, giving their jobs back to the men.

As one of six yard lift of>erators al the plant, Brown transports hogsheads of tobacco from the plant's receiving area to its 32 storage sheds. Her average load Is eight hogsheads  about four tons.

Becoming a yard lift operator was more a matter of circumstance than planning. Brown says. Eight years ago, she took a job as a paBet repairer at Brook Cove. She was promoted to fork-lift operator, and then worked as a hogshead repairer at Shed Ho. 116.

She didn't much like that work, she says, so when she was offered the opportunity to operate a yard lift she jumped at H That was few years ago.

Also by 1980, women accounted for about 42 percent of the American workforce, compared to about 18 percent at the turn of the century and 25 percent In 1950.

Rebecca Middleton Chief repairer

Oght years ago, when Rebecca Ml d-dleton was "asked to go out for mechanic," she had no hesitations.

"1 said yes," she recalls. "1 thought, 'Why not give It a try? It was a chance to move up."

And move up she has. Last November, when she was offered the opportunity for the fourth time, Middleton became the company's first female chief repairer.

"I turned chief down three times because I didn't feel I was ready," she notes. "I felt very comfortable with my mechanical abilities* but I fell I needed more experience dealing with people because the chief job is a leadership job. You've got to gel along well with people to gel quality and productivity from them."

As much as se enjoys her work, Middleton admits that the road to the top has not been easy. When she started as a repairer, she wasn't well accepted by her male co-workers and she took a lot of ribbing from them, she recalls,

"At first, tiiey hesitated on catling  : me," she says. '* "therewere a jot of men that thought a lady coutdrftdothajob,;.' But after they found out that I could do Uttjo^ttall worked o>^             ;

Linda Bokien used to be deathly afraid of electricity.

"tf a breaker tripped in the basement, I wouldn't touch K," she recalls. "But now that I understand It, T m not afraid of it I respect R."

Bokien s understanding of electricity can fin a book, In the last sU years, sheV worked her way up to electrician A. She's assigned to R&D Maintenance, but there Isn't an electricaljob inthe company that she Isn't qualified to handle.

"Bright Belt Beverages " she pro claims, producing a deer-glass bottle with a green and yellow label deleting tobacco plants.

"And then there's this one,*' she says, holding up a Mountain Dew bottle commemorat'ng the Southern Flue-CuredTobacco Festival at Green-villc, N.C. in 1979.

The two tobacco bottles are pari of Kctner's huge collection of soda bottles with applied color labels  labels that are silk-screened, enameled or painted on the bottles.

She started her collection in 1972. "I was visiting relatives In Houston and we went to a flea market where there was a lady collecting bottles," she recalls. "I started looking at thern and it kind of got me interested, looking al the pretty labels."

She was hooked

Since then, Ketner has acquired some 3,000 bottles, representing more than 2,000 different brands and styles.

Among her favorites Is a Carolina Moon Dry Ginger Ale bottle from the 1940s. The bottle is adorned with a bright orange moon and the boast: "Mellow as Southern Moonlight"

Another unusual bottle once held Caravan Dry, ar^propriatery enough, "The Oasis of Ginger Ales."

Computers boost sales efficiency

A lot of electronic games are being played in drug stores, supermarkets and convenience stores these days, but the sound of one computer Isn't for amusement.

In a pilot test of a new reporting system, sales representatives in the Winston-Salem sates region have been using hand-held computers to report their retail activity in each call for the past three months.

'TB admit that I was a bit apprehensive at first,'* says JK McLauren, area sales representative In tire Charlotte, N.C., division. "Now, I wouldn't be able to get along without my computer."

The computers are programmed to

step of their calls, recording and displaying data such as inventory, advertising activity, and package and carton fixture placements.

"After an Initial training session, it took about three days to get comfortable with It," says McLauren, "The computer Is a big help In being able to pinpoint trouble spots in same calls right away."                 ,

Area Sates RepresentMiloe Jackie McLauren records Inventory, advertising and other call data In her hand-held computer In a Charlotte grocery atore.

At the end of each day, sales representatives plug their computers Into a modem (a teleplione coupling device) which transmits data by telephone to a host computer in Winston-Salem. Their activity reports are available to Field Sales managers tlte next day, througli a video display terminal In the manager's office.

"We're very excited about the advarv

mm  mm   n -m    - -wm jf    -rv    -m       -m

tages of the new system," says Sam Hendrix, Winston-Salem regional sales manager. "Before, reporting involved a lot of paper work, sending that paper work by mail and having the data avail-

able two weeks after the activity. Now it haptens overnight"

The system benefits everyone," says Yancey Ford, vice president  Sales Operations. "It improves the sales representative's efficiency in each can. k allows division managers overnight access to sales activity in their division. And it puts our company years ahead of competition with immediate access to marketplace information."

The company is expected to begin a national rollout of the system in April.

THE CIGARETTE CONTROVERSY

The cigarette controversy has raged since the early 1950s, when a number of studies seamed to focus oh cigarettes as a possible cause of long cancer*

At that time, most scientists considered the findings of these studies insufficient to prove a case against smoking. Since (hen, many other studies have been done.   But there is still no proof that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer--or any other disease*

9                                   In aplte of this, however, the campaign against smoking has

been picking up momentum on a broadening front.   In 1962, Britain's Royal College of Physicians issued its widely publicized

|                             report. "Smoking and IMS, fa 1*4 and 1,67. twoAmerlcan

reports on smoking were published under the aegis of the United States Surgeon General*

|                                   SmoMng and h..lth ha. fccome . matter f inten.. pubHc

concern. The controversy has generated thousands of articles and speeches. But thoughtful smokers and non-smokers alike, are still deeply puzzled by this question;                                    \;

What ts the truth about the cigarette controversy?

THE FALLACY OF OUILT

BY STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION

The tase against smoking rests in very large part on guilt by statistical association.   For example:

- An increase in cigarette smoking and an apparent increase in casea of lung cancer. -- The reports that more smokers than nonsmokers suffer from lung cancer and some other illnesses. For some observers, this statistical evidence suffices to prove that smoking is a cause of such ailments.

But in medical science, statistical associations alone cannot H                               prove the existence of a cause-and-effect relationship.   On a

number of occasions in the past, scientists have come to mistaken conclusions by erroneously assuming that statistical associations can establish the cause of a disease.

For example, in certain regions of Brazil, an ailment known as Chagas' disease was statistically associated with a large number of goiter cases.   Researchers therefore assumed that

I1                                 Chagas' disease caused goiter.  Subsequent research proved that

i                                 an altogether different factor -- a body deficiency of iodine --

V      - ......     :

Another example:  it was once believed that corn caused

a

t

i

*  . pellagra, because there was a high Incidence of the disease among

*,..;                           .ul;'.        .-w  .                          .

people who ate a lot of corn.   Later, however, it was found that a vitamin deficiency in their diet -- not corn -- caused pellagra.

It is interesting to examine statistics used in the case against Cigarettes to see what they do --or do not -- show and how they are being used  or misused.

SBC FALLACIES IN THE STATISTICS oMUKilNu AIw tlKAJj *W

Doctors and scientists who have studied the cigarette controversy with great care have exposed at least six fallacies in the statistical case against smoking.

1.     Nonsmokers suffer from the same heart and long diseases ajsmofrors.

As a, matter of fact, the diseases existed long before anyone ever smoked a cigarette.

2.     The statistics are spread too thin.

Statistics have been used to link cigarette smoking with more

than two doaen diseases, including lung cancer, heart disease,

bronchitis, emphysema, cirrhosis of the liver  nearly e^tty

ailment that afflicts the human body.   When statistics link i

cigarettes with so many diseases, they detract from the soundness of the claim that smoking causes any of them.   Even the Surgeon Qeneral1* lv64 report recognised this......

3.     The actual Incidence of lung cancer (the disease most frequently mentioned In charges against smoking) may not have increased very much --if at all.

Authorities suggest that the reported increase in lung cancer incidence is due In great part to improved medical diagnosis.

Many earlier cases were simply missed.   Cases mistakenly identified as "consumption, " "influenza, " "pneumonia" or "respiratory disease" are now more accurately diagnosed as lung cancer--thanks to X-rays, fluoroseopes, bronchoscopes and other new,' improved diagnostic techniques.

4,     The findings appear contrary to experimental "dose-response" concepts; i.e.. if cigarettes cause cancer, the earlier you start

to smoke and the more vou smoke, the earlier you should get lung cancer.

    Yet, while people have been starting to smoke earlier and more heavily with each succeeding generation, the peak age for lung cancer remains the same.

Heavy smokers, the figures show, get lung cancer at the same average age as light smokers or even nonsmokers*   The largelt number of lung cancer cases occurs at about age 0 and this peak may now be occurring at an even older age.   In short, there seems to be no relation between the peak age at which lung cancer occurs and the amount or duration of smoking^

5.     Equally puggling in the statistical findings ia the gap between the number of men and women who get lung cancer*

Forty years ago, relatively few women smoked cigarettes; today, many of them do.   If smoking causes cancer, one would expect that as more women took up smoking, their lung cancer rate would approach that of men.   But this is not so.   The gap between male and female lung cancer death rates has actually widened*-and its cause is still unexplained.

6.     There j^re, many geographic disparities between lyfag cancer rates and amounts of smoking.

If smoking were the cause of lung cancer, it would be reasonable to expect that (he incidence would be higher In countries where more cigarettes are smoked per capita.   But this just isn't the case,   Consider:

-- Although people in Great Britain smoke much less per person than Americans, the incidence of lung cancer in Britain is twice as high.

-* Cigarette smoking in the Netherlands is also considerably lower than it is in the U.S., yet lung cancer death * rates are about one-third higher than here*  - Australians smoke almost as many cigarettes as do the British, yet have less than one-half the Incidence of lung cancer.



FURTHER FALLACIES

Reports used to indict smoking are filled with many other contradictions.   Here is a sampling;

- A 1967 U.S. government report showed that the people who smoked eleven cigarettes or less a day had a better health record than nonsmokers.

-- The same U.S. government study also reported that the incidence of heart conditions and cases of hypertension in women smokers was only about half that in women who never smoked.

-. Heart disease, in another report was less frequent among ex-smokers than among nonsmokers* Another contradiction:

Although surveys indicate that cigarette smokers die slightly earlier than nonsmokers, even tiie Surgeon General's Advisory Committee conceded that In the seven major studies considered by it, "the smokers-of one pack of cigarettes or more daily have death rates tiiat average slightly below the U<$* white male figure."

4

How can smokers die earlier than nonsmokers, yet live        *

longer than the average U, S. white male?   This can only mean that the samples used in the studies were non-representative of

the total U.S. white male p.filiation.

Consider the "inhalation puzzle."  In a British study that helped launch the cigarette controversy, the smokers who inhaled were found to have a lesser incidence of lung cancer than those who did not inhale,   This led Sir Ronald Fisher* known as the father of modern statistics, to comment:

"Should not these workers have let the world know, not only that they had discovered the c.u,e ol lung c.ncer (cigarettes, but also that they had discovered the means of its prevention {inhaling cigarette smoke)? " However, this is not the only contradiction in the "inhalation puaale*11  The U.S. Surgeon General's report showed that pipe smokers who inhaled had about the same death rates as men who didn't smoke at all.   Some experts have therefore come to the conclusion that pipes are "safer" than cigarettes*

This apparent contradiction seems to fly in the face of facts cited in the 1964 Surgeon General's report.   There are many compounds which can induce cancer in animals, but only a small number of these can be found in tobacco smoke, and these only in minute quantities.   The most potent of these is said to be benzpyrene; and the Committee reports that there is ten times as much benspyrene in pipe smoke as in cigarette smoke.   Yet according to the Surgeon General's report, pipe smokers *~ even those who inhale, those who smoke more than ten pipefuls per

day and those who have smoked for more than 30 yearn  have death rates no different from those of nonemokers*   The same statistics show a higher mortality rate for former pipe smokers than for either smokers or nonsmokera.

Contradictions multiply, and absurdities abound.

For example, a California study showed that while smoking mothers had more low-weight babies than nonsmoking mothers, the nursery death rates for these babies were 40% to 60% lower than for such babies born to nonsmoking mothers.

It is patently ridiculous to draw conclusions forcigarettcs from such data, yet many of the conclusions drawn against cigarettes are equally tenuous.

STATISTICS THAT ARE IGNORED

Some people might think that the anti-smoking reports have had the field to themselvei, because the publicity has been loud and Incessant.   But the truth is that much research-generally played down, overlooked or flatly ignored by the anti-smoking

forces -- suggests some vastly different conclusions.

1.    Unscientific Methods.   The widely publicised report called "Cigarette Smoking and Health Characteristics, " released in 1967, was based on a survey conducted for the U.S. Public Health Service.   Information about the smoking habits and medical histories of three out of every five of the men smokers and ex smokers in the survey did not come from the men themselves,

Much of the information in this poll (which by publicity has been given the dignity of medical authority) did not come from the person being profiled.   None of it came from his doctor.   It came from someone who happened to answer the door when the interviewer called*   A 19- year -old could be asked to analyze her parents' smoking records and report the entire family^ medical histories by checking off a long list of ailments ranging from asthma and bronchitis to kidney trouble and varicose veins.

The smoker himself might have had a hard time making such complicated diagnoses.   Even his own doctor could have found it difficult.

Despite this, the results from these interviews wore given the weight of laboratory findings to two decimal places.   Publicity releases were then written, press conferences were then held and a rash of anti-cigarette headlines appeared in newspapers across the country*

....   :/m-

"SMOKING IS LINKED TO LOSS OF TIME FROM WORK AND RECREATION,1' headlined The New York Times on May 2, 1967.   The startling claim that 77 million excess work days are lost by smokers each year wee reported as fact even though this widely publicised conclusion was neither stated nor justified by the report.

2,    Irresponsible Use of Statistics.   The frightening claim that "300,000 excess deaths a year" are caused by cigarettes has echoed from thousands of editorials,  stories and speeches.   But the use of this 300,000 figure is as irresponsible as it is speculative.   Where does it come from?

The Surgeon General's 1964 report, prepared by an Advisory Committee, specifically said that the number of deaths that might be attributed to cigarettes could not be "accurately estimated. " As the Assistant Surgeon General* who was also Committee Vice Chairman, told the press at the time:   "The Committee considered the possibility of trying to make such calculations, but it involves making so many assumptions that the Committee felt it should not attempt this, that it might be as misleading as it was informing*"

Yet, on the first anniversary of the report, on January U,

mm.-.:-*-      -                ~                           "                F               .                                                                                       '                                                               .".,.*

1965, Emerson Footc attacked cigarettes for causing 125,000 to 300,000 deaths a year.   (Foote was at the time chairman of the Nation* \ Interagency Council on Smoking and Health, a quasi-

official anti .dgarette group that operates out of Public Health Service offices m Arlington, Virginia,)

Soon, Daniel Horn, psychologist-director of the National Clearinghouse for Smoking and Health, was saying that smoking was responsible for at least 125,000 premature deaths a year.

His source* he said, was Emerson Foote.

In hearings before the Congress, Foote was asked where he got his figures.   His reply;  the Public Health Service, Horn's employer.   In the public press, this game of ping-pong--which was utterly without scientific support--was never exposed.

At the same Congressional hearing, the ball was tossed back-Into the hands of Daniel Horn.   Asked for an explanation, Horn counted up 138,000 deaths -- 33, 500 from lung cancer, 80,000 from coronary disease, 16, 500 from bronchitis and emphysema, and B, 000 from cancer of the oral cavity, esophagus, larynx and bladder.   Horn had arbitrarily included diseases that were not claimed In the 1964 Suigeon General's report to be causally related to smoking.

Before long, former Surgeon General Luther Terry undertook to explain the 300,000 figure.   He did this by;

a.   Using Horn's unsupported explanation of 138, 000 deaths*

b.   Adding to Horn's figure another 102,000 deaths *

"from diseases where the relationship to cigarette

smoking, while not so obvious, is nevertheless

clearly Indicated."

c*   Tacking on "a reasonable estimate" of 60* 000

excess deaths for women. Although this improvised 300, 000 figure is no more than an arbitrary estimate based on speculation, it has become an enormously publicized catchphrase in the case against cigarettes. It has been printed, reprinted,  stretched, inflated,.. and, in many quarters, accepted as gospel.

3.    Misuse of the Term "Research." In 1966, Surgeon Oenerai William Stewart spoke of an "additional I, 300 studies11 that "further confirm" the conclusions of the Surgeon General's 1964 report on smoking.   Thereupon, the Public Health Service furnished a bibliography of some 2, 000 "studies" which, It said, supported tha view that cigarettes were hazardous to health*

What were these studies?

i After duplicate references were weeded out, 78 percent of

them turned out to be irrelevant or unscientific.   Included were: - Letters to magazine dr newspaper editors or articles of opinion--including items in Good Housekeeping* The Saturday Evening Poet and Playboy--:                      <

all written by laymen, one of whom was poet-humorist Ogden Nash explaining why he was

continuing to smoke*

-- Studies already included in tho 1964 report,

-- Reports printed long before the Surgeon

General's report and presumably considered

previously--two of the listed publications t in

fact, dating back to the 1800s.

-- References to anti-cigarette campaigns* As for the remaining 22 percent of the papers, none demonstrated that smoking causes human disease.   Most repeated earlier findings and contributed no new knowledge.   And many actually conflicted with the anti-smoking premise*   Of papers dealing with lung cancer, fourteen failed to show an association between smoking and the disease.   Similarly,  six others on heart disease failed lo show a link between that ailment and cigarettes*

THE LABORATORY

AND CLINICAL EVIDENCE

Statistics aside, how reliable is the other evidence in the case against cigarettes?   Is it equally controversial?   Equally

cn co

CO

o

CO



First.of all, no one knows what causes cancer*

Cancer is a disease affecting the body cells which causes them to reproduce at an abnormally rapid rate.   In their wild proliferation, the diseased cells "invade" and destroy normal cells.   But no one knows yot why and how this abnormal cell growth begins or how it develops.   No one knows why it develops in some parts of the body and not in others*   No one knows why it afflicts some people and not others*

And, what is more, no one has ever been able to prove that any ingredient as found In cigarette smoke is a cause of this disease.

Much has been made of the fact that the painting of smoke condensate (so-called "tar") on the skins of mice has caused skin cancers.   But these laboratory experiments cannot be directly related to cigarette smoking by humans.

Furthermore, the per-mouse dose of smoke condensate used has been estimated to be equal to the exposure of a human lung to 100,000 cigarettes a day.

One critic of the skin-painting experiments has called them

* the application of the "wrong material, in the wrong form, in the

wrong concentration, to the wrong tissue of the wrong animal."

The truth remains that no one has been able to induce epidermoid cancer in the lungs of any animal with tobacco smoke, even though scientists have been trying to da so for years*

In addition, clinical investigation has turned up the "exposure to smoke" puaale*   It may be described in this way:

If smoking causes cancer, and there has been a great increase In smoking, you would expect cancer to increase correspondingly in those areas of the body with which smoke comes in contact. Yet this li not true.   There has been no such increase reported for cancer of the nose, mouth or larynx, and cancer of the tongue and lip is actually decreasing.   Even in the lung, most cases of cancer occur In areas which are exposed to less smoke*

Much weight has been given, too, to the autopsy work purporting to show so-called "pre-cancerous" changes in the respiratory systems of smokers.   Researchers, however, have warned against jumping to the conclusion that these "changes" convict smoking.   Similar cell alterations, after all, are found in non-smokers, even in children.   They are as frequently found in the trachea, where cancer is a medical rarity, as they are in other parts pf the bronchial tree.   And it has not been demonstrated that they actually lead to cancer.

No scientific proof, then, has been found to convict smoking as a hazard to health*   The statistical, clinical and experimental

And, frequently, these And lags have been a rehash of earlier findings, producing more of the same inconclusive evidence.

The fact is that smoking today stands accused on virtually the same evidence that the scientific community admitted to be insufficient only a few years ago,

ARE SMOKERS "A DIFFERENT BREED OF GAT"?

Not since pre-Prohibition days after World War I has there been such a public hue and cry*   Surely, it seems, there must be some rock-solid core of fact in this national hullabaloo.

But is there?

When challenged, the anti-smoking forces come back to a statistical claim;  the surveys Indicate that smokers die somewhat earlier than nonsmokers do*

The question at issue here (if this statistical claim is correct) is;

What does this really have to do with smoking?

According to many doctors and scientists, the answer if --

t probably nothing,                                                                         '

Smokers as a group, they suggest, are "a different breed of

Studies show that the cigarette smoker marries' more often than the non smoker, drinks more black coffee and liquor, changes jobs more frequently.   He is taller, heavier and more extroverted. He was more rebellious as a child and is more likely to have parents with heart disease or hypertension.

People who smoke, then, may be a kind of people who. in

any place, at any time* would have higher death or illness rates

* than those who don't smoke, because of their constitutional makeup, genetic background or general patterns of living.

Researchers have found a greater number of coronary heart disease cases among individuals with the following characteristics; they have a family history of such ailments; they tend to be over* weight and have high serum cholesterol levels.   Shey are people with greater drive and ambition, engaged in competitive activities, often under time pressure of schedules and deadlines.   Such people, perhaps as a result rather than a cause, are often heavy smokers*

Heart disease and cancer researchers are finding new evidence that both emotional and physiological factors may he involved4 in determining a person's predisposition to disease. Furthermore, these factors may develop, combine and interact differently in each individual, leading to illness in some cases but not in others.

Viewed in this broader perspective, smoking, like diet, exercise end other habits, may well be a symptom  not a cause. Researchers are finding tiiat smoking may be only one of many Indications that deep-rooted mental and physical factors are at work within the individual.   According to a growing number of researchers, it's a combination of such underlying factors that may--quite apart from smoking--produce illness*

MORE CHALLENGES TO MEDICAL RESEARCH

As health research progresses* it becomes increasingly clear that factors other than smoking (as well as smoking) need much deeper and wider study.

The very cause of cancer is still unknown.

The causes of heart disease, emphysema, many respiratory and circulatory diseases are also unknown*

Some day, these human scourges will be conquered, as new research finds new answers to some of mankind's oldest questions.

Somo of the promising avenues for further investigation are

these;

*

1,    Constitutional Factors*   Further investigation of the points discussed above:

"Are smokers a different breed of cat"? 2.    Air Pollution.   More thorough investigation of the possible role of air pollution in cancer, heart and respiratory diseases.

A study of air pollution in Liverpool, England, for example, shows that smog concentration -- and, coincidental^, lung cancer rates -- get progressively higher between rural areas and the center of the city.

*    Yirtua,ea*   Investigation of the role viruses may play in causing various forms of cancer.

Current government and widespread private research indicate that viruses may be one of the most likely among the suspected causes of cancer.

4.    Occupational Hazards and Stress.   More thorough investigation of the possible disease-causing role of physical haaards and psychological stresses on the job.

People In many occupations have been shown to have higher death rates from lung cancer and other diseases which are often mentioned as being.linked statistically with cigarette smoking.

THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY'S CONTltlBUTION TO HEALTH RESEARCH

In order to help advance scientific understanding of the causes, as well as the means of preventing and controlling

a

b                             disease, the American tobacco industry has contributed millions

of dollars for independent research on smoking and health.

During the past thirteen years, the industry has supported over 300 independent health studies through the industry's Council for Tobacco Research   - U.S.A*

The nature and extent of the Council's research has been determined by a distinguished, independent board of scientists, affiliated with many of the country's leading academic, research, and governmental institutions.

In support of further Independent health research, American Medical Association's Education and Research Foundation is now administering a five-year, $10 million grant from the industry. More than 100 studies have been undertaken, under grants awarded by the Foundation, to Investigators at academic and research Jt                             institutions and hospitals.

Do cigarettes cause disease?   In spite of all the debate  in apite of all the research -- that questions is still unanswered, a                             The industry will continue to seek the truth in the continuing

So this is what happens when a normal smoker smokes - inhales 10 puffs -

1 puff/minute. Nicotine level in about a minute reaches a maximum.

1 Total in his system of six quarts is 180 micrograms - or about WS

part of a drop of nicotine. Then about 2-5 minutes after he finishes

smoking nicotine level drops to 35 ug or about 1500 of a drop and stays

there for a while and eventually disappears. Thus nicotine goes up to

1 WO ^r in the body <3oTfth part of drop) at the start of the cigarette,

stays there for the duration of smoking, then drops to about 35 ug

But there are ways to increase or decrease this nicotine delivery: One can take a deeper puff or shallower puff. Average puff is 35cc 1/7 of a cup. But it can be as high as 60cc or 1/4 of a cup. One can puff more frequently or less frequently. Instead of a puff a minute it could be 2 a minute. One can take a deeper puff and hold the smoke in the

JLet's look nsjifeat a smoker who truly enjoys smoking and how he might

differentiate^ Between cigarettes. How would he rate one cigarette

fjet'e first look at the various discrete steps in the smoking process. First one takes a puff on a lit cigarette and draws into the oral cavity over a 2-second period 35co or l/7th of a cupful of smoke. . Second - one holds the smoke in the mouth for a fraction of a second. Third, if cne is an inhaler one inhales the smoke into the lungs and

Ol

holds it there for a second or two and finally one exhales the smoke. ^   Jj

Something important happens during the time the smoke is held in the mouth. Also, something very important happens during the time the smoke is held in the lungs.

While the smoke is held in the mouth the smoker perceives a very

slight physiological reaction, the extent of this reaction depending

on the character of the smoke. Xf it is a high tar cigarette, say

a non-filter 25 - 30 mg. tar and a pH around 6.0, he will in the

short time he holds the smoke in the mouth perceive a mild nicotine     !

effect. Be ftjvtftd associate this mild nicotine effect with good

cigarette fXavor, good taste, good smoking satisfaction. There

is relativeljRjJAttle nicotine transferred to his taste buds and

Into his booS^fluida. But it is enough for him to perceive it as a

i**H It is a lott^ar cigarette, say around 10 mg. and ph 6,0, as before there tffeuld be less nicotine transferred in the mouth than

'sir                             *.,__.i

from a 25 - 30~mg. cigarette. Obviously - he would discern less taste. To enhance this taste, one must raise the pR of smoke. So

imply by raising pH, say from 6.0 to 6,5 you raise the level of nicotine that is* transferred to the taste buds and body fluid in the mouth to the same level as with the higher tar cigarette. And hence, even though the tar level has been dropped from 25 to 10, by raising the pH from 6.0 to 6.5, you increase the nicotine transfer in the mouth/ and you restore mouth satisfaction which we can call flavor, taste, smoking quality, smoking satisfaction -

OI

call it whatever you wish.                                                                                               o   -nj

And this is the key to taste - the transfer of nicotine to taste buds and body fluids in the mouth during the short time you hold the smoke in your mouth before inhalation. For any tar level - there is the right pH for maximum taste.

t

For any tar level -  if the pH is too high - the smoke is Intolerable -if pB is too low - the smoke will have very little satisfaction.

Back In the forties for example, CAMELS, Chesterfields, and Lucky Strikes lead high tar, around 30 mg. At that tar level - mil cigarettes provided I appreciable nicotine taste in the mouth. I am assuming that pB of CAMELS \

vvis higher titan the other two - Chesterfields and Luckies *- and the majority of smokers went for CAMELS with the higher mouth satisfaction.

 CAMELS were fcfily more satisfying.'

But it is im||Ftant to recognize that with ail the old non-filters and even with soamkpf the early filters there would be adequate mouth satlsfawrtiorvajfc the usual pH. In' those cases, pH was not critical,     J

Nov let's lobtPat the next step in smoking - the inhalation step.

get in the lungs from low tar cigarettes is much less. So the smoker then resorts to other means to get the nicotine he needs In the blood from low tar cigarettes by longer puffs, by bigger puffs, by more frequent puffs, and also by smoking more cigarettes      4 each day. It has been observed that as one switches from a non-filter to a filter, one smokes more cigarettes per day* But                                     j eventually one can change his style of smoking so one could get enough nicotine into the blood during the Inhaling step by           I changing the smoking style; i.e., longer puffs, bigger puffs, atid more frequent puffs.

Certain gas phase constituents are important* These are formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein; and maybe methyl vinyl ketone. These must fall in a prescribed range. Acrolein for example should be in the range of 50 ug to 100 ug. Acetaldehyde 500 to 1200 micrograms per cigarette.

However, the sensible scientists do not look upon nicotine and CO       \

as a health hasard. They maintain now that It is very easy to pre*     J

determine those people who are at risk - and these people,

whose cardiovascular system is already in such very serious condition -

should watch whatever they do. Any little disturbance in these

Most of the responses we (R&D, RJRT and/or the tobacco industry) should ake to the public attitudes reported by Sordine are so obvious that there i&  no point in ny repeating them; e>gt#

- Improve social acceptability,

<*.  Develop positive and refute any erroneous negatives in the smoking/health area*

- Improve Company/industry iraa&t.-s.

- Etc., etc.

Some other things* perhaps not qui ...& no  obvious* need oonsidera* tion:

- the total market for cigarette* is projected to be essentially flat over the long term.

- About one-third of the adult ^v^ulotion la in that siarket at,any given titae,

- Host of those who have srcoked f*;r any significant tij* would like to stop*

- Many, but not most, of those who would like to stop aaoking are able to do so.

Thus* the total (transient) market fur cigarettes is the result of a dynaraic equilibrium, wi l,h about ;.<s eany new smokers entering it as confirmed smokers leavir.g it.

*       .

- Any change at either end (enti)/exit) of this equilibrium will change the position cf the equilibrium, hence the size  of tbanarket*

- Therefore, we vee4  to focus r or t effort on adult wpr o-sjnoker& and on confirmed snokoj-5 who would like to stop smoking,

- To do this we need to know rc> ::>j -jotc about

o Why florae confirmed smokers are able to stop smoking and other* art r.ot able.

o Positive/negatives associated with stopping smoking.

o State of the art, present/projected, of techniques for stopping smoking.

With sufficient knowledge/information, we should be able to maintain/increase the size of the total market by influencing entry/ exit rates; and we should be able to improve our share of the market by targeting our products to the crucial entry/exit groups at both ends of that total market.  That assumes that the entry/ exit gates will remain substantially as they are now.

However* we cannot ever be comfortable selling a product which most of our customers would stop using if they could.  That is to say, if the exit gate from our market should suddenly open, we could be out of business almost overnight,

- Some slow but steady "progress" is being made in developing techniques for stopping smoking; but no universal, easy method is ye'. ;.n sight.

- The probability of such a othr:<? appearing in the near term i3 srcall.

-  The probability of such a net-hed appearing over the long term approaches lOOJt.

- If/when that occurs, our optiorr. include:

(^o Go out of busine-s,

(iJ)o Find a way to eliminate the desire of smokers

(3y> Provide other products, away from conventional cigarettes, which meet the same needs cigarettes now neet, but without t.*>v associated negatives.

-  If, of the above al ternati ver. (1) is unacceptable, and (2) is not likely to be achievable, then we need to seriously consider (3).

o We need to define the gr;r. if ications (social, psychological, physiolc^i ia\,   oral, manipulative, visual, etc.) dcrlvi-d/expected from smoking of conventional cigarettes.

Clearly, we will remain in the conventional cigarettes business as long as we can, but I believe, in view of the Nordine study and other information, we need to begin to very seriously think about where we go when/if that market disappears. There are some long tern, high risk/cost things that we need to address because,to repeat, we cannot be comfortable marketing a product which most of our customers would do without if they could*

HEM0RAHM1H:

In a sense, the tobacco industry may be thought'of as being a specialized, highly ritualized and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry.   Tobacco products, uniquely, contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects.   Related alkaloids, and probably other compounds, with desired physiological effects are also present in tobacco and/or its smoke.. Nicotine is known to be a habit-forming alkaloid, hence the confirmed user of tobacco products is primarily seeking the physiological "satisfaction" derived from nicotine ~ and perhaps other active compounds.   His choice of product  . and pattern of usage are primarily determined by his individual nicotine dosage requirements and secondarily by a variety of other considerations including flavor and irritancy of the product, social patterns and needs, physical and manipulative gratifications, convenience, cost, health considerations, and the like.   Thus a tobacco product is, in essence/a vehicle for delivery of nicotine, designed to deliver the nicotine in a generally acceptable and attractive form.   Our Industry is then based upon design, manufacture and "sale of attractive dosage forms of nicotine* and our Company's position in our Industry is determined by our ability to produce dosage forms of nicotine which have more overall value, tangible or intangible,'to the consumer than those of our competitors.

The habituated user of tobacco products is said to derive "satisfaction" from nicotine.   Although much studied, the physiological actions of nicotine are still poorly understood and appear to be many and varied.   For example, in

______different situations and at different dose levels, nicotine appears to act as

y)               a   stimulant, depressant, tranquilizer, psychic energizer, appetite reducer,        ^

anti-fatigue agent, or energizer, to name but a few of the varied and often

contradictory effects attributed to it.   Many of these same effects may be : achieved with other physiologically active materials such as caffeine,                     (

alcohol, tranquilizers,* sedatives, euphorics, and the like.   Therefore, in addition to competing with products of the tobacco industry, our products may,In a.sense, compete with a variety of other products with certain types of drug action.   All- of these products, tobacco and other, appear to have certain common attributes in that they are used largely to relieve, in one way or another, the fatigues and stresses which arise in the course of existence .    in a complex society.

Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine is both habituating and unique in its variety of physiological actions, hence'no other active material "j1              or combination of materials provides equivalent "satisfaction".   Whether

nicotine will, over the long term, maintain, its unique position is subject '    to some reasonable doubt.   With increased sophistication of knowledge in   '        . the biological and pharmaceutical areas, a superior or at least equivalent product or product mixture may emerge.   For this reason,'it would be a mistake, to assume that the tobacco industry.'as we now know ft, is immortal or that no -   direct competition from organizations' outside of the tobacco industry will ever pccur.   It is safe to assume, however, that nicotine will retain its unique position throughout the present ten year planning period, and probably for a much longer span of time.                                                                               

...                                                                                 Q,

.                          o>

If nicotine is the sine ojja non_ of tobacco products and tobacco products

.                                                                              CO

nicotine delivery rather than "tar" delivery or flavor. To do this we need to    o

*               develop new data on such things as the physiological effects of nicotine,

the rate of absorption and elimination of nicotine "delivered in different                f

doses at different frequencies and by different routes, and ways of enhancing or diminishing nicotine effects and "satisfactions".   In the absence of such fcta, we may survey the market and conclude that current cigarette products delivering about 1.3 mg. of nicotine appear to "satisfy" the typical     , smoker.  This, somewhat crudely, establishes a target dosage level'for design of new products.   An accompanying Research Planning Proposal describes that .    approach in some detaiK   However, if we knew more about nicotine absorption, action, elimination, enhancement and the like, it should, in theory, be

'.               possible to more precisely specify, and deliver, the optimum amounts of nicotine

activity in sophisticated products which would be more satisfying and desirable

~\              to the user.   This area merits consideration and activity.

, Before proceeding too far in the direction of design of dosage forms for nicotine, it may be well to consider another aspect of our business; that is, the factors which induce a pre-smoker dr non-smoker to become a habituated smoker.   Paradoxically, the things which keep a confirmed smoker habituated and "satisfied", i.e., nicotine and secondary physical and manipulative gratifications, are unknown and/or largely unexplained to the non-smoker.   He does not start smoking to obtain undefined physiological gratifications or reliefs, and certainly he does not start to smoke to satisfy a non-existent cravinq for nicotine.   Rather, he appears to start to smoke for purely

*...!.                     .-".                                                     ,0>

psychological reasons - to emulated valued image, to conform, to experiment, g -------to defy to be daring, to have something to do with his hands, and the like.   ^ ^

'   )                 Only after experiencing smoking for some period of time do the physiological *  2

"satisfactions" and habituation become apparent and needed. Indeed, the first    M

? .V

J

smoking experiences are often unpleasant until a tolerance for nicotine.has been developed. This leaves us, then, in the position of attempting to design and promote the same product to two different types of market with two different sets of motivations, needs and expectations. The same tuation is encountered in some industries, but the problem is usually not

si

as severe.

If what we have said about the habituated smoker is true, then products     designed for him should emphasize nicotine, nicotine delivery efficiency, nicotine satisfaction, and the like.   What we should "really make and sell would be the proper dosage form of nicotine with as many other built-in [             '                    attractions and gratifications as possible -- that is, an efficient nicotine

))               delivery system with satisfactory flavor, mildness, convenience, cost, etc.

On the other hand, if we are to attract the non-smoker or pre-smoker, there is nothing In'this 'type of product that'he would currently understand or desire.   We have deliberately "played'"'down the role of nicotine, hence the non-smoker has little or no knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer him, and no desire to try it.   Instead, we somehow must convince him with wholly  irrational reasons that he should try smoking, in the hope that he will for himself then discover the real Satisfactions" obtainable"   And, of course, in ' the present advertising climate, our opportunities to talk to the pre-smoker are increasingly limited,' and therefore, increasingly ineffective.  Would it hot be better, in the long run, to identify in our own minds and in the minds of our customers what we are really selling, i.e., nicotine satisfaction?        *

f^  --------   This would enable us to speak directly of the virtues of our product to the     8    ^

V-                      confirmed smoker, and would educate the pre-smoker, perhaps indirectly but           2

effectively, in what we have to offer and what it would be expected to do                   co

for him.

But again, the picture is not quite all that clear.   Critics of tobacco products increasingly allege that smoking is dangerous to the health of                   '

the smoker.   Part of this alleged danger is claimed to arise from ingestion of nicotine and part is claimed to arise from smoke components orsmoke "tar*'.   If, as proposed above, nicotine is the sine o^non of smoking, and if we meekly accept the allegations of our critics and move toward reduction or elimination of nicotine from our products, then we shall eventually liquidate our business.   If we intend to remain in business and our business is the manufacture and sale of dosage forms of nicotine, then at some point we must make a stand.   We should know more, rather than less, than our critics about the physiological effects of nicotine, and we should in all ways scientifically validate and speak to the beneficial effects and -satisfactions1* derived from use of nicotine.   Essentially all commercial drugs give rise to some undesirable side effects, but we continue to use them with great benefit    . to humanity because of their overriding beneficial effects.   Might we not take a leaf from that book in our approach to nicotine?   Unless we do, our long-term prospects become unattractive.

Our critics have lumped "tar* and nicotine together in their allegations

*

about fiealth hazards, perhaps because "tar" and nicotine are generated together in varying proportions when tobacco is smoked.   An accompanying Research Planning Memorandum suggests an approach to reducing the amount of "tar" in cigarette smoke per unit of nicotine.  That is probably the most realistic approach in today's market for conventional cigarette products.   However,              ^

another  futuristic approach is ^sibie which 9oeslore directly to.he      1    S fundamentals of the alleged problem.                                                                       jj

If our business is fundamentally that of supplying nicotine in useful dosage form, why is it really necessary that allegedly harmful "tar" accompany that nicotine?  there should be some simpler, "cleaner", more efficient and direct way to provide the desired nicotine dosage than the present system involving combustion of tobacco or even chewing of tobacco. A conventional 1000 nig. tobacco rod containing about 20 mg. of nicotine is smoked to produce only about 1.3 mg.of smoke nicotine, accompanied by about 20 mg. of "tar" and 20 mg. of gas phase matter; and a -sttfeffeential part of the 1,3 mg of smoke nicotine is lost to the smoker via exhaled smoke  surely an inefficient nicotine delivery system.   It should be possible to obtain pure nicotine by synthesis or from high-nicotine tobacco.   It should then be possible, using modifications of techniques developed by the pharmaceutical and other industries, to deliver that nicotine to the user in efficient, effective, attractive dosage form, accompanied by no "tar", gas phase, or other allegedly harmful substances.   The dosage form could incorporate various flavorants, enhancers, and like desirable additives, and would be designed to deliver the minimum effective amount of nicotine at the desired release-rate to supply the "satisfaction" desired by tbeuser.   Such a product would maximize the benefits d&rind from nicotine, minimize allegedly undesirable over-dosage side effects from nicotine, and eliminate exposure to other materials alleged to be harmful to the user.   For the long terra, we should be working toward development of such products  if we do not inevitably someone else will, and there are strong indications that others are already moving in this direction.

In the present real situation, where nothing has been done to counteract the adverse allegations about nicotine and where conventional products delivering adequate amounts of nicotine dominate the marketplace, no abrupt change in our posture or strategy would be appropriate or reasonable. The approaches advocated above are aimed at stopping and eventually reversing a trend that may in the long term put us out of business, and are intended to lay a framework of philosophy around which research efforts may now begin. Hopefully, some day we will rejoice rather than despair when a new crop of tobacco shows an unusually high content of nicotine, our primary product. Hopefully, with time we will be able to develop sophisticated and improved

I                        '                                            '                                             "                     i.         '                                      I                           .        .                    *

minimum dosage forms for nicotine which will be more satisfying to the user and free of alleged health hazards.   And hopefully, by that time, we will have been able to establish and use information showing that use of nicotine fills real, demonstrable human.needs, the beneficial effects overriding the allegedly harmful side effects.

My suggestion covers all these conditions* It is basically to go back                                  

as such as possible - probably at least halfway ** towards the old filter cigarettes, 1. e., the cigarettes of the 1950*6 prior *e the Surgeon                                              *

istics as distinguished froa today's cigarettes:

1,  They delivered wore flavor (tar).

2.  They delivered taore "enjoyment" or "kicks" (nicotine)*                                                  3* They delivered more puffs - at least 20X wore. (A fringe             I

The reasons for these differences are not so much between the tobacco bf today and that of the 50*s, but the paper (rauch more porous today) and the filter material (much more absorbent today).

In my judgnent, for public relations reasons It would be impossible to go back all the way to the 1955 type cigarettes* As far as tar and nicotine In the stsoke are concerned, 1 believe it should be possible to achieve the desired effect by going to a tar level of today's Pall Mall (non-filter type) of about 29 mg tar and 1*8 mg nicotine* Still, with an old style filter, any desired additional nicotine "kick** could be easily obtained through pH regulation.

To summarize, it should be easy to develop, within a relatively few weeks, these new youth-appeal cigarettes for market testing for which the following advertising claims could be unequivocally proven: They will deliver more flavor, more enjoyment, and more puffs for the noney than any large selling cigarette on the market, or for that natter, than any other cigarette now on the market.

It is my understanding that a very Halted number of cigarettes of the 50's are available from a scarce supply for test comparison purposes from the Tobacco Development Department (Tom Bskew or Del Johnson).

In our conversation yesterday, you mentioned that you were just then trying to develop a concept for a new brand appealing to the old CAMEL and other old type cigarette smoker except having a filter. I believe that the concept outlined above can also be used for an old timers* brand with possibly a somewhat different top dressing formula.

In discussions with Ed Taylor, he has indicated that the trend for flue cured crops is for a reduction in nicotine for 1977 and 1978* In accordance with this trend, values for WINSTON and WINSTON B have moved from 2.OX and 1.8% respectively, to 1.741 *M  l.etft in the tateit teats.

Harketing Research has characterised the WINSTON B product ss smooth, mild, and light. They have tso indicated that these characteristics expose the brand to soma risk among heavy WINSTON smokers* *

The implications of the above data is that a continual drop;in nicotine for W1HSTON S aggravates the risk to heavy smokers since it will make the product lighter, and possibly less satisfying.

To avoid this 1 am proposing establishing maximum and minimum blend nicotine levala for WINSTON B- 1*8% max and 1.6% min. If crop trends push blend nicotine values below 1.6%, I  feel an adjustment in grades la desirable. As WINSTON B is rolled Out national, we can 111 afford to have the brand be perceived as not satisfying. It must remain acceptable until smokers have acclimated themselves to the new product*

A nicotine control eyitem with upper and lower limits la one way to address this question.  I would alto appreciate your thoughts on this matter.

SC3JEC?: MPD Report on Teenage Sirokers (14-17)

Attached is a MDD report covering the aforementioned subject. Last January, a report was issued on this subject that indicated that Philip Morris had a total share of 59 among 14-17 year old smokers, and specifically, Mariboro had a 52 share. This latest report indicates that Philip Morris1 corporate share has increased s   by about 4 points; however, Harlboro remains the same at 52*

**- Importantly* the report further indicates that RJR continues to gradually decline, and between the spring and fall 1979 periods, RJR'a toal share declined from 21.3 to 19.9.

Hopefully, our various planned activities that will be implemented this fall will aid in some way in reducing or correcting these trends.

RE: DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GALLUP POLL ESTIMATES ANDREW ESTIMATES OF TEENAGE SMOKING INCIDENCE

Per your request, the following are my comments on the difference between the Gallup estimates and my HEW-based estimates of smoking incidence.

  Historically, all Gallup Poll estimates of smokiiig incidence have been higher than HEW's. For example, in 1974 and 1978 Gallup's estimate of adult smoking incidence was approximately 3* hia,her than HEW's estimate*                           .,   :v

* The primary reason for this discrepancy appe&r-s ;,tb be in the definition of a current smoker.                         ..:-< t

-  Gallup defines current smokers as those who respond affirmatively to the question: "Have you smoked any cigarettes in the past week?"

-  HEW defines current smokers as those who answer yes to:  "Do you now smoke?" This definition is further qualified by asking if the respondent smokes one or more cigarettes per day.

Gallup*s definition appears more likely to include an occasional smoker, i.e., the guy who smokes a couple of cigarettes when out on a Friday night. This definition also tends to count experimental smokers as part of the smoking population. Since the majority of experimental smokers are young, the inflationary effect f this definition (relative to HEW) would be highest among teenagers.

  The Gallup estimates quoted in the attached article may not                  be directly comparable to my estimates. It appears that 18 year olds are included in the Gallup incidence figures, while           u, my estimates cut-off at 17 year olds.         '"                                  g

*t~

  Differences in sampling methodology are not a major contributor  w

to the discrepancy. Both Gallup and HEW used telephone surveys,  g and any differences in sample size and sampling error would ^ -3 appear to be relatively minor*                                             ^                              w ^

Mr. J. B. Stuart Page Two February 21, 1980

Finally, while it is difficult to say which is the better measure of true smoking incidence, my estimates agree more closely with a 1979 study by the National Institute.of Education (received by our library less than two weeks ago) This report estimates smoking incidence among 12-18 boys at 10.7$ and among 12-18 girls at 12*7%. The report is quoted in the March 3, 1980 issue of Forbes Magazine (see " attached).

Most importantly* I do not believe the differences (however large they may actually be) result in substantively differentiator > conclusions or future implications. Both studies conclude that incidence s higher among girls than boys, teenage boys are heavier smokers, etc.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

Res   Disclosure of Invention

Subject:   Filter Tip Materials Undergoing Color Change on Contact with Tobacco Stroke

X have observed* and believe it to be generally true, that the cigarette sacking public attaches great significancs to visual exanint-tion of the filter material in filter tip cigarettes after smoking the oigarsttes*   A before and after smoking visual comparison it usually made and if the filter tip material, after amoking, 1* darkened, the tip is automatically judged to be effective, the degree of darkening being considered tat criterion of filter efficiency.   There is, incidentally. soe merit in this type of qualitative test, though it la far fro. JSkU.   taw* tha iSng pSli. rtUokw .ignifio^c to thl. visual Inspection* the possibility or incorporating chemicals into filter tip materials that would darken or otherwise change oolor on contact with smoke appears attractive*

It ie proposed that filter tip materials,, auch as cotton, tobacco ate* pulp, and the like, be treated with appropriate amounts of suitable pH indicator dyes, or other materials capable of color change on contact with smoke.   Preferably the indicator dye, or material, should be colorless on contact with the filter tin material, which should also be light in color, and should undergo oolor change to a dark color, preferably brown, on contact with tobacco awoke   Other color changes, or combinations of oolor changes, could also be used*   Filter tip material night be treated with mixed indicators, so as to be one color initially,              o

changing to another on contact with smoke j a change from blue to red                    ^

for example.   Many modifications of the basic idea are possible.                           "

o

While use of such color change materials would probably have                 ^

little or no effect on the actual efficiency of the filter tip material,              

the advertising Hhd sales advantages are obvious.
