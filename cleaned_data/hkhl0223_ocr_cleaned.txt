	not understand the question, please do not hesitate

12
	
	to ask me to rephrase it.  Okay?

13
	A.
	I will.

14
	Q.
	If you do understand the question, I want you to

15
	
	answer it truthfully and honestly.  Okay?

Yep.

And it lists, you know, for you to bring, you know,

everything that you've relied on in this case and any

documents that you have reviewed regarding Demos

Jones?

Correct.

Have you brought those today?

I have brought my CV, I have brought a reliance list

and a CD of all those documents that I relied on for

formation of my opinions,

Okay.

I believe I've brought a section of some

interrogatories that I used to look at brand history

for Demos Jones and the complaint, I think, is what I

brought, if I'm not mistaken.

Okay.

Those are all the documents I would have in

connection with this case.

Okay. Do you know when you were listed as an expert

	Or somewhere in that neighborhood,

	Q.
	When was the last time you testified at trial?

	I testified a few weeks ago in Barbossi, I believe

	was the name of the case, in -- north of Tampa.

7
	Q.
	Okay.  How much of your time is spent either in

10
	A.
	It's very sporadic at this point, so I really

11
	
	don't -- unless I'm called to a deposition or a

12
	
	trial, that's really the only time I spend -- This

13
	
	year, I've spent -- I've gone to --'I've testified

14
	
	four times live at trial.  I have probably gone down I

15
	
	to Florida in anticipation of potential testimony

16
	
	probably twice that, so probably eight times. And

17
	
	this is the second deposition I've taken this year,

18

7
	Q.
	Okay. And then, as Exhibit .4, you've provided a disk

	of reliance materials. Does what is on this disk

9
	
	correspond with Exhibit 3 in your reliance materials

11
	A.
	It does.  It gives you the actual materials in full

12
	
	on the disk, for everything that is on the list.  It

13
	
	should be well over 1,000 documents at this point.

14
	Q.
	And for the sake of not going through the list, is

15
	
	there anything in your reliance materials or on this

	Case specific? No.

19
	Q.
	When was the first time that you testified on behalf

20
	
	of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

21
	A.
	I believe it was in 2008 in the Sherman case, if I'm

22
	
	not mistaken.

23
	Q.
	Okay. Had you ever testified before the Sherman

25
	A.
	I had not, no.

	A.
	I'm sorry? I don't know what you mean.

4
	Q.
	Well, I'm trying to -- When you started testifying in

5
	
	2008, how many times did you testify in 2008

6
	
	approximately?

7
	A.
	I think I was in maybe four trials in 2008,  I know I

8
	
	testified in Sherman, live testimony twice I think in

9
	
	Sherman.  I think I was in the Martin case, which was

10
	
	also a Florida Engle case that year,  I spent ~~ I

11
	
	then did a non Engle.case in Missouri, Lincoln Smith,

12
	
	at the same kind of timeframe. And then there may

13
	
	have been another trial, but I can't remember,  I've

14
	
	done over 30 trials over the course of, you know, the

16
	Q.
	Has your testifying been relatively consistent over

17
	
	the years?

18
	A *
	I would say I'm pretty consistent.  Now, there's

19
	
	obviously new things that have happened --

20
	Q.
	Sure.

21
	A *
	� with the company, so my testimony has included

22
	
	that as it has occurred.  For instance, things like

23
	
	dissolvables, dissolvable tobacco being launched, or

24
	
	the e-cigarettes, VUSE, and obviously Kentucky

1        But,,with regard to the history and what has happened

2        to Reynolds and its R&D, that remains consistent.

3   Q.  Now, before you testified in the Sherman case, what

4        kind of preparation did you undertake?

5   A.  I did a lot of reading.  I spent a good deal of time

6        learning the history of Reynolds, learning the

7        history of Reynolds' R&D, understanding what the

8        company positions had been over that many decade

9        timeframe.  I would meet with the lawyers about once

10        a week for an hour or two to talk about the issues

11        that come up in litigation, discuss that.  I had

12        questions about what is it like in the courtroom,

13        what is it like to be deposed, because I wanted to be

14        prepared.  So that's the kind of preparation I had.

15   Q.  Okay. And then how long did this

16        preparation -- obviously, it would take a while to

17        review 50 years of research and history. How long

18        did it take you to review and prepare for the first

19        time?

20   A,  Approximately, about a year, I would say.  I think I

21        began -- I know when I became vice president of

22        product development in 2008 is when my boss had asked

23        if I would consider being a company representative.

24        I think I spent nine months to a year getting ready.

11
	
	your duties would include testifying at trial and in

12

13
	A.
	No, that was not part of my duties.

14

	Okay.

15
	A.
	I was asked if I would consider doing that, and I had

16
	
	certainly thought about that as a -- doing that as a

17
	
	representative of Brown & Williamson before the

18

	Not long after.  I would say a few weeks or -- I
	

2
	
	don't remember the exact circumstance.  I remembei
	* my

3
	
	boss asking me if I would consider it and I said
	

4
	
	sure.
	

5
	Q.
	Was that within a, would you say a month of being
	

6
	
	promoted?
	

7
	A.
	It may have been, yeah.  It was early on.
	

8
	Q.
	Do you enjoy being a witness for R.J. Reynolds
	

9
	
	Tobacco Company?
	

10
	
	MR. KREINER: Objection to form.
	

11
	
	THE WITNESS: That's kind of a hard
	

12
	
	question,  I believe in supporting the
	

13
	
	company.  I believe in the company,  I
	

14
	
	believe what our strategy is, so I
	

15
	
	think it's important to have people
	

16
	
	that can talk about the history.  It's
	

17
	
	not necessarily easy; it's, obviously,
	

18
	
	a little bit stressful.  So in that
	

19
	
	aspect, I feel capable.  It's hard to
	

20
	
	say I enjoy it, but I feel I'm capable
	

21
	
	of doing it, I think I can represent
	

22
	
	the company well, and I don't mind
	

23
	
	doing it.  The volume could be less in
	

24
	
	my opinion, that would be nice, but
	

25
	
	otherwise I don't mind doing it.

	I went -- I grew up in Fairfield, went to high school

7
	
	in Fairfield, Connecticut, and I got an undergraduate |

8
	
	degree, went to school a few years after I graduated

9
	
	high school, stayed local, went to a university

10
	
	called Eastern Connecticut State University.  I

11
	
	studied basically geology, environmental earth       |

12
	
	science, chemistry minor, graduated there and worked  |

13
	
	in the private sector as.an environmental consultant

14
	
	for a little less than two years, and then applied to j

15
	
	graduate school at University of Massachusetts       \

17
	
	masters and PhD from U Mass Amherst.               j

18

21
	
	was a national science foundation fellow at Auburn

	In 1999.

2
	Q.
	Okay. What was your daily duties when you worked for

3
	
	Auburn?

4
	A.
	I was a researcher so I was doing post-doctoral

5
	
	research so I was studying reaction mechanisms of

6
	
	chlorine dioxide at that time, the oscillating

7
	
	reactions, so that was an interesting type of

8
	
	reaction system to study. So I was kind of a geeky

9
	
	scientist is what I was.  I went in every day and I

10
	
	ran experiments, I wrote papers, I analyzed results.

11
	
	So it was really quite nice because as a post-doc �

12
	
	You know, previous, when I was at U Mass, I did

13
	
	research, obviously, to do a PhD, but I also had to

14
	
	teach. And I loved teaching, but it was difficult to

15
	
	juggle and manage teaching classes, trying to earn a

16
	
	bit of a living there and do your research at the

17
	
	same time. At Auburn, it was pure research and I got

18
	
	to go in everyday and that's all I did.

19
	Q.
	Who did you do the research on behalf of? Were you

20
	
	given grants to do research?

21
	A.
	The grant -- It was a grant to Dr. David Stanbury at

22
	
	Auburn chemistry department.  He got a national

23
	
	science foundation grant to study these type of

24
	
	reactions and part of that grant was to hire post

25
	
	doctorals and I was one of his post docs under that

1                 grant.

2   Q.  You were with Auburn for about how many years?

3   A.  Well, I finished my daily defense at U Mass in '97,

4        so I went to Auburn in the summer of '97, finished

5        writing, obviously, my dissertation.  I missed the

6        date so my degree didn't come until '98, but I was

7        done.  So I started at Auburn in the summer of '97,

8        or late spring of '97, and stayed there until April

9        of '99.

10   Q.  Then what was -- When you were hired at Brown &

11        Williamson Tobacco Company, what was your initial job

12        responsibilities with them?

�3       a.  i was a oencn cnemist, i was associate cnemist.  x 14      studied � I basically got hired at Brown &

16        formation of toxicans in smoke, understand the

17        degradation of tobacco under combustion and pyrolysis

18        conditions.  So I got hired in as a chemist, a low

19        level bench chemist, and that's how I started.

20   Q.  Did you do any research on Brown & Williamson before

21        you went to work for them?

22   A.   I didn't, actually.  I mean, the -- When my professor Z3                  at Auburn said ne wasn t sure it tne grant was ~"~

24        whether he was going to get another grant or not and

1        around for other employment just in case, and I did

2        and I answered an ad for a chemist, so there was

3        really no description,  I talked to the recruiter, we

4        had a good conversations and he asked me do I have

5        any issues working for a tobacco company.  I was a

6        smoker at the time, didn't really know anything about

7        tobacco, other than the products, and when I

8        discovered and got interviewed - a couple of phone

9        interviews and a few face to face interviews, I kind

10        of understood what the position was about, it

11        interested me. Like I said, I was a smoker at that

12        time, I had a couple of grandparents that died of

13        smoking related diseases, and my understanding of

14        what Brown & Williamson was trying to do and the

15        position that they were hiring for was to try to

16        reduce the risks associated with smoking, so I

17        thought that was an admirable thing to study.  I

18        didn't realize at the time just how complicated it

19        really was. But, the position interested me and the

20        work interested me,

21   Q.  Did you have any reservations at all regarding the

22        nature of Brown & Williamson's business?

23                 MR. KREINER:  Object to the form.

	significant or not, so that's what we had talked

13
	
	about. But, I mean, other than that one occasion, I

14
	
	never really -- we really never talked about -- or I

15
	
	don't remember talking about tobacco related issues.

16
	Q.
	Now, have you been promoted since beginning at Brown

17
	
	& Williamson Tobacco Company?

18
	A.
	Well, sure.  I mean, I'm the vice president of

19
	
	cigarette product development today.  I got hired in

20
	
	at the lowest science level that you would have for a

21
	
	PhD at that time, which I think was an associate

22
	
	chemist, so I've had a number of promotions over the

23
	
	years.

24
	Q.
	Do you know how many times you've been promoted at

25
	
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

1      A
	I mean, it's on my CV.  I haven't counted it in terms

2
	of the number of times, but I've gotten at least one

3
	promotion as a scientist.  Then I was asked -- I

4
	remember filling out in my career preferences at

5
	Brown & Williamson what I think 1 would do in five

6
	years and, as you probably would understand based on

7
	what I've already told you, I was kind of in an

8
	academic world for a number of years and I presumed I

9
	would probably be a professor at some point. And

10
	knowing what professors do, they typically manage the

11
	work of graduate students and post doc's and things

12
	like that, so I put in my career preferences that I

13
	think I could probably manage professional scientists

14
	at Brown & Williamson and, be careful what you ask

15
	for, because it wasn't too long after that I began to

16
	manage people.  I eventually became the director of

17
	applied research at Brown & Williamson before the

1 o
	merger with R.J. Reynolds in 2004,

19   Q
	Would it be fair to say that you've been promoted ten I

20
	times with either Brown & Williamson or R.J. Reynolds

21
	Tobacco Company?

22   A
	I don't know if I've had -- I don't know if I've been

23
	promoted, but I've certainly held a number of

Zi h
	different positions, so sometimes I would change

25
	roles without getting a promotion.  But, I would say

	R.J. Reynolds now owns all of Brown & Williamson?

	Certainly.                                      j

1        understand what R.J. Reynolds is responsible for and

2        the brand histories and that type of thing.

3   Q.  And you understand that R.J. Reynolds is responsible

4        for the Lorillard brands, the Brown & Williamson

5        brands and the American Tobacco brands, correct?

6                 MR. KREINER: Objection to form.

7                  THE WITNESS: Certainly, American, and

8                   Brown & Williamson.  The Lorillard

9                   brands, we did not buy all of the

10                   Lorillard brands. I know we bought

11                   some Lorillard brands, Newport in

12                   particular, Old Gold, Camp, and True,

13                   so I would assume we're responsible for

14                   those.

15   Q.  Do you know if R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company is

16        responsible for Salem brand cigarettes?

17   A.  That was a former Reynolds brand and my understanding

18        according to the deal is that we will maintain that

19        responsibility in litigation for a period of time

20        moving forward for both Salem, Kool and Winston.

21        That is my current understanding of the terms of the

22        acquisition.

23   Q.  Thank you.  Have you -- Well, in how many areas have

24        you been designated as R.J. Reynolds' individual with

	documents that would be presented to me

	conducted that deposition, so I believe

4
	my testimony in the Duval County

18
	with the anticipation that that

19
	testimony would be used for all of

20
	Duval County.  I'm pretty sure that

21
	testimony has been used in other cases

22
	outside of Duval County as well, so I

23
	knew and I think the lawyers knew at

	that time that would potentially be

	Institute Council for Research so it functioned as a

2
	
	scientific body and industry trade group to direct

3
	
	research and was part and parcel to being a trade     f

4
	
	organization.  That got broken up, obviously, into TI j

5
	
	and the CTR in the late 1950's so-you had a research

	Okay.  Just --                                  J

9
	A.
	And I haven't spent a lot of time thinking about that

10
	
	for this deposition, but as I recall that's basically

11
	
	what it was.

12
	Q.
	So let me be a little more clear with my question.

13
	
	What does TIRC stand for?

14
	A.
	I believe it's the Tobacco Institute Council for     \
 i

15
	
	Research, if my memory serves. And, like I said,

16
	
	that was the initial group that was formed in the

17
	
	late 50s to deal with tobacco issues and try to

1 0
	
	conduct research into tobacco and health related     j

19
	
	research and serve as a grant and aid foundation for  j

20
	
	outside researchers to study problems. Then, like I

21
	
	said, it got broken up into two entities.  I think it

22
	
	was in 1958 or '57.  I can't remember the years now.  j

23
	Q.
	And those two entities are? What was the name of    \

24
	
	those two entities?

25
	A.
	Then you had the Council for Tobacco Research, the

	CTR, and then the Tobacco Institute and those moved

	forward until they were dissolved in 1998.

3
	Q.
	Were all three entities, the TIRC, TI, and CTR, all

4
	
	dissolved at the same time?

5
	A.
	No.  Like I said, the TIRC was ended in the 50s and

6
	
	it was broken into two entities is what I recall.

7
	
	And the two remaining entities, the TI and CTR, were

	The migration strategy is a corporate strategy by

20
	
	which we are attempting to provide products �

21
	
	tobacco related products -- on the market that would

22
	
	potentially allow people who use the most risky

23
	
	products, like cigarettes, and provide options for

24
	
	them to migrate to tobacco products that would


	
	provide less risk.  So our migration strategy is, A,

5
	Q.
	Since you have been working at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

6
	
	Company, have -- Ifm going to call them traditional

7
	
	cigarettes; is that okay?

8
	A �
	Uh-huh.

9
	Q,
	Have traditional cigarettes become any safer?

10
	A .
	I would say no, they have not.  They -- Since I have

11
	
	been working for Reynolds, we have not made

12
	
	significant changes to the cigarette portfolio.  The

13
	
	range of products that we offer has been largely

14
	
	similar for a number of decades at this point.

15
	Q.
	Has -- Since the 1950s, have traditional cigarettes

16
	
	become any safer?

17
	A.
	In my opinion, I would say that they certainly carry

18
	
	that potential.  What we do know, I think, factually,

19
	
	is that people who smoked non filtered cigarettes,

20
	
	from an epidemiological standpoint -- for those who

21
	
	largely smoked non filtered cigarettes to those who

22
	
	largely smoked cigarettes with filters, that a number

23
	
	of disease end point risks have dropped, haven't

24
	
	eliminated them, but the relative risk is lower.  So

25
	
	one could make an argument that, yes, there has been

	some progress in that area.  Certainly, with regard

2
	
	to the hopes of I think both the industry and public

3
	
	health with regard to continued reductions in tar

�4
	
	delivery, that the amount of risk reduction has not

5
	
	been as large as people would have hoped it would

6
	
	have been, but I believe there is some.

7
	Q.
	So is it your belief that filters made traditional

8
	
	cigarettes safer?

9
	A.
	Comparing filters to non filters, I would say

10
	
	absolutely, yes.

11
	Q.
	What about the filters made the cigarette safer?

12
	i\ �
	When you smoke a cigarette with a filter, it does

13
	
	reduce the exposure of the consumer to tar -- tar and

1 "
	
	nicotine and by reducing your exposure to tar, you

15
	
	will, therefore, reduce your exposure to toxicans and

16
	
	carcinogens in the tar. And I believe the

17
	
	toxicological premise in terms of disease propagation

18
	
	involves dose, in other words the amount that you

19
	
	get, and the duration in which you are exposed to

20
	
	that dose, so by reducing the dose, you can, in fact,

	Q.
	Do filters increase the inhalability of cigarettes?

	�\ .
	No, and I'm not quite sure I know what that means.

24
	
	Inhalability, or the way in which people inhale or

25
	
	choose to inhale, is a learned behavior by the

	individual.

2  Q,  Has the reduction in tar made cigarettes safer?
	
3  A.  Again, it's a relative comparison. Compared to non
	
4
	filtered cigarettes, I would say yes. Has it -- It

5
	has not eliminated the risk of smoking.  It has not

6
	dropped the relative risk to the extent that people

7
	had anticipated it would say in the 1950s, 60s or

8
	70s.  So, again, in comparison to the way cigarettes

9
	were designed, non filtered cigarettes from the 50s,

10
	let's say, I would say filters have helped reduce

11
	that risk to some degree.

12  Q.  Okay.  Besides the filter, what other changes to
	
13
	cigarette design since the 50s have made cigarettes

14
	safer?

15  A.  Again, from -- and it's -- I certainly testified to
	
16
	this before, but a whole host of changes had occurred

17
	to cigarettes and cigarette design technology in an

18
	effort to reduce tar.  That was the directive both

19
	from a public health perspective and public health

20
	authorities, making those assertions that the

21
	reduction of tar would help reduce risk.  So things

22
	like more reconstituted tobacco; the use of stems in

23
	cigarettes to reduce tar was accomplished; the

24
	development, implementation of expanded tobacco to

25
	act as dilly way was accomplished and utilized in

4        I've -- obviously, I've testified to many of these in

7   A.  -- all helped to try to reduce tar and nicotine

8        delivery to the smoker.

9   Q.  I know that the idea was that these design changes

10        would help.  I guess what I want to know is if they

11        did help?

12   A.  Again, to a certain degree, they did. Certainly, if

13        you read surgeon generals reports, public health

14        reports from the 60's, 70's, 80's, 90's, the

15        suggestions from public health were if people

16        continued to smoke, they should smoke lower tar

17        cigarettes, all based on the belief that dose and

18        toxicity would make a difference.  That somehow

19        changed in 2000 with Monograph 13. But, yet, even

20        with Monograph 13, if you read Monograph 13, they do

21        suggest that there is a reduction in lung cancer

22        rates as a -- largely attributed to cigarette design.

23        Although, as they pointed out, that was a small

24        reduction in lung cancer rates.  So, again, --

25   Q.   From RJR's point of view --

	A.
	From our --

2
	Q.
	-- did any of the design changes that you just

3
	
	mentioned decrease the risk of cigarettes?

4
	A.
	I believe they decreased it to some degree, yeah.

5
	Q.
	Okay.

6
	A.
	I do believe that.  I believe what the epidemiology

7
	
	says and has said for decades.  I also believe that

8
	
	that reduction is not large enough, that that

9
	
	reduction was not as large as both the cigarette

10
	
	companies as well as public health thought it would

11
	
	have, and so, therefore, you see some of the things

12
	
	that were done at Reynolds to take a different path:

13
	
	Things like the development of Premier and Eclipse

14
	
	and moving in different directions in terms of

15
	
	looking at the public health issues related to

16
	
	tobacco products.

17
	Q.
	Did -- How much did it reduce the risk? All these

18
	
	design changes from the 50s, how much did it reduce

19
	
	the risk of traditional cigarettes?

20
	A.
	I don't know,  I'm not an epidemiologist.  But, from

21
	
	what I understand, there was a reduction between

22
	
	certainly non filtered cigarettes and filtered

23
	
	cigarettes.  I don't know what that number is.  And,

24
	
	again, I would go by what I read in Monograph 13 that

25
	
	there was some reduction.  I don't know if I can put

3
	Q.
	Was it statistically significant?

4
	A.
	I would say it was, yeah. And, certainly, the

5
	
	epidemiological reports between non filters and

6
	
	filters, at the time they came out in the 50's, 60's

7
	
	and 70's, certainly indicated that.

8
	Q.
	Do you know what percentage of the population was

9
	
	smoking a filtered cigarette in 1960?

10
	A.
	In 1960, it would have been less.  There were --

11
	
	Filters had became popular after Winston came out in

12
	
	1954.  So by 1960, I wouldn't -- I don't think it was
 s

13
	
	half at that point, but certainly as you move through

14
	
	the 60's, it certainly rapidly increased. And, you

15
	
	know, where we are today, obviously, there's very few

16
	
	people that smoke non filtered cigarettes and almost

17
	
	everybody is smoking not only filtered cigarettes,

18
	
	but lower yielding cigarettes.

1
	should try to reduce the amount of tar

2
	that they were being exposed to. At

3
	that time, it was unclear, certainly to

4
	the tobacco industry and to public

5
	health, and certainly in the 50fs,

6
	whether there was an actual

7
	relationship between cigarette smoking

8
	and disease.  There was a statistical

9
	relationship, but it was unclear

10
	whether or not that meant there was a

11
	causable relationship.

12
	Certainly, Reynolds' operating

13
	premise, if you look at some of the

14
	documents we have, certainly in the

1 c
	late 1950's, the thinking was if you
 �

16
	find toxicants, carcinogens, and other

17
	things in cigarette smoke, whether or

18
	not one can link those directly to a

19
	cause of disease, it would be best not

20 ,
	to have them in there.  So, certainly,

21
	one of the ways you can try to

22
	eliminate or reduce tnose constituents

23

	was to reduce the amount of smoke. Now, filters, not

15
	
	long time. So there was always -- I mean, FDR used a

weeks ago on that issue.  So* yeah/ I'm generally

aware of that.

Do you know what the rise in adenocarcinoma is

attributed to?

Well, I don't know exactly.  I think the surgeon

general and others may have suggested that cigarette

design plays a role. But, like I said, the latest

paper I've read, that the adenocarcinoma rates have

not only increased for cigarette smokers but it's

also increased for non smokers.  So, if the adeno

rates in non smokers is increasing in a similar way

to cigarette smokers, then one can't attribute that

to cigarette design, or at least they can't fully

attribute that to cigarette design.

Do you know who wrote the study you're referring to?

I think it was Lee, L-e-e.

Would you smoke a pack a day?

No, not at that time.

When did you become a regular smoker?

I would say after high school when I started working.

I would say that was probably the time.

Did -- Was there a reason you became a regular

smoker?

I enjoyed it.

It didn't have anything to do with stress?

I mean, I was like �I put in burglar alarms and cut

grass so, I mean, there's really not a lot of stress

for those kind of jobs. No, I enjoyed smoking. A

lot of my friends smoke.  I still enjoy it, but I

haven't smoked cigarettes in a long time.

Do you still have the craving for cigarettes?

No, I wouldn't say so.  I mean, I still use tobacco

products.  I think you miss the -- you can miss the

smoking part of it, the inhalation, the -- a lot of

the rituals around smoking.

What tobacco products are you using today?

Currently, Snus, and I will use the VUSE product as

well, which is our electronic cigarette.

Okay.  And do you use Snus on a daily basis?

I do.

Do you use the VUSE on a daily basis?

	A.
	I do now, yes.

2
	Q.
	The VUSE, is that an electronic cigarette?

3
	A.
	It is.

4
	Q.
	Do you have any idea how many puffs of the electronic

5
	
	cigarette you take a day?

6
	A.
	No, I don't.  But, I mean, I will open up a cartridge

7
	
	probably once a day.

8
	Q.
	1 o  1 L        v3* **. vUO v  ILLv i

9
	A.
	It's hard to equate --

10
	Q.
	Sure.

11
	A.
	-- a cartridge to cigarettes. And it's really

12
	
	not -- I mean, I think an electronic cigarette is a

13
	
	useful product and I think it likely will be less

14
	
	risky, certainly, than smoking cigarettes.  But, it's

15
	
	hard to equate the two because the ritual is a little

16
	
	bit different, even though you're puffing and

17
	
	inhaling.

18
	Q.
	j.s mere any rooacco xn an exectronxc cxgarerre.

19
	A.
	Well, nicotine is derived from tobacco, obviously.
 m-. �

20
	
	And nicotine for all products that contain nicotine

21
	
	the nicotine comes from tobacco, so that would

22
	
	include nicotine replacement therapies,

23
	
	pharmaceuticals, etcetera.  But, aside from the

24
	
	nicotine being derived from tobacco, there's not any

25
	
	tobacco in it.

	Q.
	Is a cartridge designed to be the daily dose of

2
	
	nicotine for a person?

3
	
	MR. KREINER:  Objection; form.

4
	
	THE WITNESS I  No, it is not.

5
	Q.
	Okay,

6
	A.
	It is -- The way the cartridge is designed is

7
	
	actually based on a timer so there is a certain

8
	
	amount of liquid in the cartridge and we want to make

9
	
	sure that the device will turn off before the liquid

10
	
	is depleted. So we have, basically, a timed

11
	
	mechanism that -- we say it counts the puffs, but it

12
	
	really does count the time that the device is puffed

13
	
	on, and it will turn off after a certain amount of

14
	
	time, which equates to about 180 puffs I think before

15
	
	it will stop.

16
	Q.
	Does --

17
	A.
	So, again, like I said, it's hard to equate how many

18
	
	cigarettes that would,be because people puff

19
	
	differently on cigarettes and whatnot.

20
	Q.
	There's probably -~

21
	A.
	But, you could say roughly about a pack of

22
	
	cigarettes, equivalent puffs, but it's very loose.

23
	Q.
	Loose because it varies on the individual smoker?

24
	�\ �
	It really does. And I think average full-time

25
	
	smokers today are averaging I think around 12 to 13

1
	
	cigarettes per day, but no one I don't think really

2
	
	knows how many puffs they're taking.

3
	Q.
	When did you start using the VUSE?

4
	A.
	Fairly recently. We came out with VUSE about two

5
	
	years ago.  I never really used the early products

6
	
	but the latest one I've been using, I would say

7
	
	probably the last six, eight months on a fairly

8
	
	regular basis.

9
	Q.
	When did you start using Snus?

10
	A.
	Well, I helped develop Snus, so I started using Snus

11
	
	as soon as we were making it.  I quit smoking in '04,

12
	
	we started to produce Snus in 2006.

13
	Q.
	How much Snus do you use on a daily basis?

14
	A.
	Currently, I -- probably about eight or 10 pouchs

15
	
	now.  Since I'm using the VUSE, I don't use as much

16
	
	Snus anymore.

17
	Q.
	How is the Snus packaged? How many pouchs are in a

18
	
	package?

19
	J\ �
	I think there's 15, if I'm not mistaken, in the one I

20
	
	get because I use the larger size pouch.

21
	Q.
	How long does a package of Snus last?

22
	A.
	For me, I will go through probably a pack of Snus

23
	
	every two days or so, so between -- I usually have

24
	
	extra so if I finish one, I will open the next one.

25
	
	So I probably go through about half a tin of Snus a

1
	
	day I would say roughly. .

2
	Q.
	Okay.

3
	A >
	Half, maybe a little more maybe.

4
	Q.
	How long does each pouch of Snus last?

5
	A.
	That's really variable. Whenever I get tired is when

6
	
	I take it out.  Sometimes I may have one -- I may put

1
	
	one in and then realize, ah, I think I'm going to go

8
	
	have some lunch and take it out after two minutes.

9
	
	But, you can --There's no real time limit on how

10
	
	long you want to keep it in there.  It's how ever

11
	
	long you want to use it for.

12

	Both of these -- Well, is there any other -- Besides

13
	
	nicotine, is there any other -- -- well, strike that.

	All the products � Is it a fair statement to say

15
	
	all the products that R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

16
	
	sells today contain nicotine?

17
	A.
	That R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company makes, yes.

18

1        An orb is made in a pellet press so it's mixed with

2        excipient ingredients and it's finely ground tobacco

3        and it's pressed into a pellet.

4   Q.  What about the strips; how are the strips made?

5   A.  The strips were made, I believe the final version was

6        an extruded strip, as well as the sticks were also, I

7        believe, extruded.  So they went through an extruder.

8   Q.  What is an extruder?

9   A.  Well, it's like a spaghetti maker.  So, that's what

10        you're doing when you do make spaghetti.  Or think

11        like of a meat grinder, for instance.  You grind up

12        -- stick a New York strip in there, you grind it up,

13        and out comes a bunch of thin, small strips of meat,

14        ground meat.  So an extruder works similarly.  You

15        take a bunch of powdered materials, maybe add some

16        water, you make basically a paste and then you apply

17        pressure and you put it through a formed dicast head

18        that then will leave you with the shape that you

19        want.  In the case of the stick, it came out in the

20        form basically like spaghetti and then you would lay

21        it out, you would dry it, you would cut it, etcetera,

22        And the strip was similar, except it was like a flat

23        -� imagine like a flat noodle.  In fact, our early

24        prototypes, we went to Wal-Mart and bought spaghetti

25        makers.  That's how we did it in the early design and

	How long has the dissolvable products been on the

	I smoked Camel, Camel Lights pretty much the whole

13
	
	time until I worked for Brown & Williamson, Then I

14
	
	didn't smoke a Reynolds product when I worked for

15
	
	Brown & Williamson.  I used Lucky Strike Lights,

16
	
	Then I participated and helped develop a product

17
	
	called Advance, which was a potentially lower

18
	
	yielding product that had a special filter on it that

19
	
	I helped design, and I used -- I smoked Advance,

20
	
	which came out in 2001 and smoked that product until

21
	
	I quit in '04.

22

1        light cigarettes and regular cigarettes?

2   A.  Yeah.  I smoked � I know my uncle at one time smoked

3        Lucky Strike non filter back in the early 80's and

4        you definitely can tell a difference.  I mean,

5        anybody whose ever smoked can certainly tell the

6        difference between a non filtered, filtered, light

7        and ultralight product; there's absolutely no

8                 question.

10   A.  Yield. The amount of the smoke that comes through,

11        there is a significant flavor difference, there is a iz      significant Qirrerence in impact.

13   Q.  When you say --

14   A.  The mouth full of smoke is different.

15   Q.  When you say impact, what do you mean?

16   A.  I mean the amount of irritation that one gets in the

17        mouth and in the throat and, of course, that

18        modulates what kind of behavior you want.  So I think

19        when you're a smoker, you puff on a product, if it's

20        your own product, you already � you would know what

21        size puff you want to take because you have your

22        preferences.  If you smoke a different brand, then

23        your first instinct is to puff on it like it was your

24        own cigarette.  Well, you're going to figure out

25        right away whether or not that cigarette is yielding

	more or less and change the behavior to get the

2
	
	desired amount of sensation that you want.

3
	Q.
	What causes that sensation?

4
	A.
	The amount of smoke that comes out the back of the

6
	Q.
	Is there less smoke in a light cigarette than a full

7
	
	flavor cigarette?

8
	A.
	Less smoke? Ultimately, under -- I mean, under

9
	
	standard smoking conditions, absolutely, there is.

10
	
	And it's very difficult to overcome that.  So filters

11
	
	do work.  So when you have a higher efficiency filter

12
	
	and more dilution, whether it's on a machine or you

13
	
	put it in your mouth, you're going to, in all

14
	
	likelihood, get less.  Obviously, smokers can

15
	
	compensate to a certain degree and generate more

16
	
	smoke out of a product. But, when you look at the

17
	
	design variables between a full flavor or lights or

18
	
	ultralights product, the full flavor products are

19
	
	designed to yield more smoke.  They have � a lot of

20
	
	them have more tobacco in them, they have a lower

21
	
	efficiency filter, they may not have any ventilation,

22
	
	so, yeah.

23
	Q.
	So there's more smoke in a regular flavor cigarette

	we're playing around with terms. You don't� It's

2
	
	hard to say there's -- 1 mean, there's no smoke in a

3

4
	Q.
	Right.

5
	A.
	So the terminology is what is the yield of the

6
	
	product from the smoke and what do we actually

7
	
	measure. It's not the smoke. What we're measuring

8
	
	is we're measuring the particulate matter of the

9
	
	smoke. Okay? That's what.we can physically measure.

10
	
	The smoke is both particulate phase material as well

	as gases and those things you have to look at

12
	
	differently.

	Is there more particulate matter in a full flavored

	Do smokers of the light brand cigarettes smoke more

21
	
	puffs of cigarettes to compensate?

22
	A.
	To some degree, they may. Now, what we have seen and

23
	
	what we know is that on average, people who have

24
	
	adopted a full flavored or a lights or an ultralights


	
	cigarette -- and we've certainly published on

1         this -- on average, people are exposed to less tar if

2         you smoke a lighter cigarette. That does not mean,

3         however, that somebody who smokes a light cigarette

4         can't generate as much smoke or be exposed to as much

5         smoke as somebody smoking a full flavored cigarette.

6         That can happen and does happen. But, on average,

7         when we look at hundreds of smokers and we collect

9         end of that filter and we look at those design.

10         changes, what we see on average is a decrease in the

15   A.  I don't know that you can make that distinction from

16         an epidemiological standpoint. What I know for sure

17         is that the epidemiology will suggest that filtered

18         versus non filtered provided a benefit.  It's very

19         difficult to split, at least from my understanding of | 20                   the state of science currently, it is very difficult

21         to make a determination of whether or not you can see

22         differences between the light cigarettes and full

23         flavored cigarettes.  Now, maybe the government has

24         data that we have yet to see through CPS-3 or more

1        that data being shared yet.  Is that fair?

2   Q.  So is it -- Well, I don't know that I understood your

3        answer.

4   A.  The government runs very large epidemiological

5        studies and has since the 50's.  The big problem in

6        trying to understand the health consequences of

7        smoking is there is a large lag time between when

8        somebody and how somebody has a behavior and when

9        that behavior may manifest itself in a disease.

10        Hence, when you're looking at smokers, because the --

11        Because what they may be exposed to has changed over

12        that time -- over a very long timeframe, if you

13        really want to segregate out -- and you want to

14        answer your question, do light cigarettes provide a

15        benefit versus filtered cigarettes --then, the way

16        to do that is to take a perspective group of people

17        who only have smoked full flavored cigarettes and

18        find out what their disease rates are and then look

19        at another group of people that have only used light

20        cigarettes and find out what their disease rates are.

22   Q.  So with all of the research that's been done over the

23        years, can you say that light cigarettes are safer

24        than full flavored cigarettes?

25   A.  I believe I said that.  I don't think you can -- with

the current data, I don't know that you can do that.

Now, I know there are continued government

epidemiological studies being done, but I haven't

seen reports from those yet and that data is not

available.  So I don't know that. Maybe you can,

maybe the data exists, but I have not seen it.

As of today, as we sit here right now, is it fair to

say mar iignr cigarerres are no sarer man regular

cigarettes?

I don't know that you could -- I don't know that you

can scientifically say that they're safer than

another filtered cigarette.

You just can't say either way?

I don't think you can at this point in time.

Okay.  Does the same go for ultra-light cigarettes?

I would say that goes in the same category. Now,

again, I think what we could say about ultra-light

cigarettes is -- and we have certainly published on

this -- is that people are certainly exposed to less

when they smoke an ultra-light cigarette. Now,

whether that manifests itself in significant

reductions in disease risk, I don't know that you can

say.

Are -- Is any one filter safer than another filter?

Again, you're asking me safety questions and I'm

11   Q.  What would be an example of a low exposure filter?           1

12   A.  Well, products like filters that can go on                           f

13        ultra-light cigarettes for instance, they are high           |

17        less constituents coming out the back through a                 |

and combustion and there is no combustion in an

electronic cigarette.  So, I mean, when I think of

tar, it is tne particulate matter tnat comes out or

the cigarette minus the water and nicotine. That's

what.tar is. And it's a conglomeration of a couple

of thousand different chemical components.

Well, tar contains the nicotine, correct?

No.

Tar does not contain nicotine?

No, TPM contains nicotine. ' But, when you measure tar

in a product, in a cigarette, you are taking the

particulate matter and then you are measuring the

particulate matter minus nicotine and water, so

nicotine is out.  You measure nicotine separately and

tar is what is left and that is a conglomeration of

several thousand different chemicals.

Okay,

aerosol, okay, but that's not what tar is.

Well, that confuses me just a little bit because Dr,

Garner last week told me that tar was 95 percent �

or nicotine -- 95 of the nicotine was in tar.

Well, you misunderstood -- you either misunderstood

	him or he didn't get it right.  The reason there's a

2
	
	distinction is there is something called total

3
	
	particulate matter, okay, and that's everything --    j

	That's TPM, right?                                j
 i;

	A.
	TPM.  That's everything that comes out of the

6
	
	cigarette smoke and the aerosol, minus the gases,

7
	
	okay, so TPM is not CO, it's not those components     j

	in the aerosol portion. But, when you say tar, the

12 .
	
	conventional terminology is the particulate minus

13
	
	nicotine and water.  So the nicotine is in the smoke.

14
	
	Okay? It's in the smoke aerosol, but it's measured

15
	
	separately from tar.                            . {

16
	Q.

	dangerous as tar?                       �      ' j

18

1        what it is. We've defined what's come -- we can

2        measure what comes out of an electronic cigarette.

3        What comes out of the electronic cigarette is what we

4        put in that cartridge, what is in that liquid.  So,

5        basically, you taking a liquid and you're using power

6        to turn that liquid into an aerosol.  And what comes

7        out is virtually what we put it, very little changes.

8           What you have in a cigarette is you have tobacco

9        and you set it on fire and you do chemical

10        transformation every puff you take.  That doesn't

11        happen in an E-cigarette in any conventional sense.

12        There is no combustion whatsoever.  So we can measure

13        what comes out of an E-cigarette. Do we call it TPM?

14        I'm not even sure what we call it, to be honest with

15        you. We call it a smoke aerosol or an aerosol, vapor

16        aerosol. And we can measure what comes out of the

17        back end and there is very few changes to what comes

18        out of the back end that we can detect at this point.

19   Q.  How many chemicals are in a traditional cigarette?

20                  MR. KREINER: Objection to form.

21                  THE WITNESS:  In tobacco alone, the

22                   number of chemical constituents that

23                   comprise an organic leaf is in the

24                   thousands so it's like three or 4,000

	chemical constituents in tobacco smoke.

6

 talking about is cigarettes today. Well, you said in j

8
	
	tobacco smoke so let me rephrase it. Okay?

9
	A.
	Uh-huh.

10
	Q.
	How many chemicals are in cigarette smoke?

11
	A.
	It's the same answer.

12
	Q.
	Okay.

13
	A.
	If I make a cigarette out of lettuce, I'm going to

14
	
	get thousands of chemical constituents. In fact,

15
	
	:�
 there was a cigarette made out of lettuce, called

16
	
	Bravo, which we studied intently.  It's got

17
	
	carcinogens and thousands of chemical constituents in

18
	
	it as well.

19
	Q.
	So there are over 5,000 chemicals in each puff of

20
	
	cigarette smoke?

21
	A.
	In terms of number of compounds, yes.

22
	Q.
	How many compounds or chemicals are in an electronic

1
	A.
	I do.

2
	Q.
	Okay.  How much?

3
	A.
	It all depends on what we put in it.  So for certain

4
	
	flavors, the vast majority of what is comprised in

5
	
	the liquid of an e-cigarette is vegetable glycerin,

6
	
	propylene glycol, a little bit of water and whatever

7
	
	flavor we put on.  So, now, the flavor is where you

8
	
	would have the largest number of individual chemicals

9
	
	because those flavors can be complicated and some are

10
	
	not.  For menthol, for instance, we really don't have

11
	
	much of anything other than a little bit of natural

12
	
	menthol, PG glycerin and water, so when you look at

13
	
	the -- if you do a GC analysis of an e-cigarette

14
	
	aerosol and a cigarette aerosol, it's like looking at

15
	
	night and day.  So you look at cigarette smoke

16
	
	aerosol from combustion and you look at all those

17
	
	peaks, it's like looking through a forest of grass.

18
	
	You look at an E-cigarette GC and there's just a

19
	
	couple of peaks.

20
	Q.
	So, are you -- Is it your testimony that there are

21
	
	under ten chemicals in an electronic cigarette?

22
	A,
	I'm not testifying to that. What I'm saying is the

23
	
	number of chemicals that can be identified in the

24
	
	aerosol of an e-cigarette is significantly and

25
	
	greatly less than regular cigarettes and it will be

	proportional to what comprises that E liquid. All E

2
	
	liquids are different, so people may put different

3
	
	flavors in, different combinations of flavors, but

4

	That's at the R&D facilities.  I know the types of

5
	
	I'm comfortable with how we designed and put the

6
	
	products together and the liquids together. But, I

7
	
	also know, you know, if you crank the juice up on

8
	
	some of these batteries that you see out there,

9
	
	you're going to cause some combustion, you're going

10
	
	to cause some degradation of flavor components.  I

11
	
	don't know what people are doing, in terms of what

12
	
	kind of favor components they're using.

	Well, I'm just talking about RJR Reynolds

14
	
	e-cigarettes.

15

	I know generally what is in Reynolds.

16
	Q.
	That's all I'm asking for today?

17
	A.
	It's been stewarded materials.

18
	Q.
	How long did RJR test VUSE before it introduced it to

19
	
	une marKer.

20
	A.
	Well, we had to settle in on the design on how we

21
	
	were going to do it.  It took about � I would say it

22
	
	took about a year before we released design to the

23
	
	marketplace.

24
	Q.
	Did R.J. Reynolds test VUSE on humans?

25
	A �

	haven't done � We haven't completed -- We didn't

2.
	have to complete any kind of clinical studies with

3
	people prior to having to release the product to

4
	market. We studied the aerosol, we studied the

5
	ingredients, we studied the battery, we studied how

6
	it was generating an aerosol.  It was stewarded

7
	through our stewardship program that did not require

8
	any kind of animal testing or those types of tests.

9  Q
	Did you do any evaluation of the potential harmful

10
	effects that VUSE might have?

11  A
	That's what product stewardship is, so we stewarded

12
	the product. We made a determination of what was

13
	chemically in the aerosol, what was in the liquid,

14
	what the component parts were, of how we were going

15
	to construct the cartridge, the wick, the computer

16
	chips that are in both the cartridge and the battery.

17
	So the whole device was stewarded from both the

18
	materials perspective as well as what would be

19
	delivered to the consumer.

20  Q
	So do you know what the harmful effects of VUSE would

21
	be?

22  A
	We don't know what the harmful --We don't know that

23
	there's going to be any harmful effects from VUSE.

24
	They're -- what we know is that the aerosol comprises

25
	of glycerin, PG, and a little bit of nicotine and

1        some flavor compounds. Now, the flavor compounds we

2        use are food grade materials and the stewardship --

3        the toxicologists in the stewardship group don't

4        believe that there are harmful amounts generated,  I

5       can't -�- VUSE hasn't been on the market long enough

6        to know if E-cigarettes are going to be harmless. A

7        number of public health groups have suggested that

9                 cigarettes.  In fact,: the UK says they're going to be

10        95 percent safer.  So we look at the aerosol and we

11        don't see what potential issues there would be in it.

12   Q.  If it turns out that there is an unknown harmful

14        off the market?

15                 MR. .KREINER: Objection to form,

16                  THE WITNESS:  I think it really depends

17                   on what that effect might be and the

18                   magnitude of that effect, because what

19                   we're thinking about when we make

20                   products like VUSE is there's a number

21                   of people that get smoking related

22                   diseases today and so if that � if

23                   there is a harmful effect, if let's say

24                   there is some risk of COPD from VUSE,

25                   what is that risk versus the risk of

2
	
	that risk is a lot lower for using

3
	
	VUSE, then I think that would -*- it

4
	
	would be the right thing to do to keep

5
	
	VUSE on the market. Now, if that risk

6
	
	j.Q cxcvetlevx vexou& oiuojvx ja y cxyctxeuu-eo,

7
	
	if that risk was greater, then I think

8
	
	we probably would take it off the

9.
	
	market.

10
	Q.
	So you think the only way that VUSE would come off

11
	
	the market is if it was more dangerous than

12
	
	cigarettes is?

13
	i\ >
	No, I can guarantee you it would likely come off the

14
	
	market if it were more dangerous than cigarettes. I

15
	
	mean, that is not.-- Our philosophy in putting out

16
	
	VUSE is under the presumption that there was going to

17
	
	be some harm reduction associated with it.  So if it

18
	
	turned out that it was actually more dangerous than

19
	
	smoking cigarettes, then I think we probably would

20
	
	take it off the market.

21
	Q.
	How many years do you think it will take before we

22
	
	know what the harmful effects of VUSE are?

23

Are the carcinogens in Salem cigarette smoke listed

cigarette smoke are found in all cigarette smoke.

So there's no difference between the smoke in any of

RJR brand cigarettes? They all contain roughly 50 to

60 carcinogens?

In terms of number of compounds, yeah. Obviously,

the concentration of those compounds may vary, but

the number is roughly the same.

Is that listed anywhere on your website?

	You refine it.  You take - The way I understand that

2
	
	the process works is people take tobacco waste and

3
	
	they extract it, they use steam distillation.  They

4
	
	steam distill, they take the nicotine that comes out

5
	
	of the distillate, they make a sulfate salt with it

6
	
	and then you can take that sulfate salt and refine it

7
	
	further and purify it further until you get, in the

8
	
	case of pharmaceutical grade, however many, 99.99 is

	perspective, and an issue with regard to

	e-cigarettes, you don't want -- you'd rather not have

19
	
	people having bottles of concentrated nicotine

20
	
	around.  Now, obviously, the Pharma grade stuff that

21
	
	we use to make our mixtures to put in our cartridges

22
	
	is obviously highly concentrated, so we have a lot of

23
	
	safety measures in terms or handing that,  what is in

24
	
	the cartridge, once it's being sold to the consumer

25

1        4.8 percent.  So, if you rubbed 4.8 percent e-juice

2        on your arm, probably not much of anything is going

3        to happen because there's really not that much in the

4        cartridge itself.  In a bottle of it this big, and

5        took a shower in it, you would probably get sick,

6        Just about anything is a poison at some level and

7        nicotine is --can be toxic at high concentrations.

8   Q.  So the nicotine that is put into the mixture that is

9        used in e-cigarettes is poisonous?

10   A.  Nicotine is poisonous, again, at certain

11        concentration � water is poisonous at certain

12        concentrations.  But, I mean, nicotine is poisonous

13        at high concentrations.  You can get what farmers

14        used to call tobacco sickness working in the fields.

15        So, if you worked in the fields without gloves too

16        long, you would be pulling nicotine off the plant and

17        you could get sick.

18   Q.  If you put a couple of drops of pharmaceutical grade

19        nicotine under your tongue and swallowed it, would it

20        kill you?

23   Q.  Would it make you very sick?

1        problem is -- and, certainly, we have looked into    j

2        that -- when you do things like say supercritical    |

3        fluid extractions to try to extract nicotine out of �. I

1

4        tobacco, you're left with a product that.-- you never |

5        just get nicotine out, so you end up removing a bunch j

' s is

6        of other stuff from the tobacco.  It's never as good  f

I

7        as when you started.  So, yeah, you can take tobacco  j

8        and you can throw a lot of gaseous ammonia at it and  j

9        you can blow the nicotine off the tobacco with       |-

10        ammonia, but you can't really get rid of it                         f

21        it was originally. And it's not just from a nicotine |

	A.
	So, from our perspective, when we've looked into it,

2
	
	that's made it very difficult for us.

3
	Q.
	Does RJR want to take nicotine out of tobacco?

4
	A.
	We have certainly, from a regulatory perspective,

5
	
	attempted to do that, preparing for potential product

6
	
	standards. And so what we have found� and this is

7
	
	why I'm saying it's hard -- is you can end up with a

8
	
	bunch of unusable tobacco because you've kind of beat

9
	
	the hell out of it and it's, turned into kind of mush

10
	
	and not useable.  Or when we use certain other

11
	
	techniques, like microwave techniques or

12
	
	supercritical fluid extractions, you endup, like I

13
	
	said, pulling out not just nicotine but a lot of

14
	
	other flavorful components end up coming along for

15
	
	the ride when you do those extractions, so you're

16
	
	left with a very bland, unflavorful (sic) tobacco at

17
	
	the end of the day, which is not terribly consumer

18
	
	friendly, at least from the stuff we've made with it.

2        separate it.  Then you make your paper sheet and you

3        concentrate your water extract and you put your

4        extract back on.  If you don't put your extract back

5        on, what you end up with is a paper bag which is

6        recon'd. And if you've ever burned or tried to smoke

7        a paper bag, it's not very pleasant. But, when I

8        take the extract and apply it back on where I got it

9        from, it ends up tasting like tobacco, which is. much

10        more pleasant than smoking a paper bag.

11                 VIDEOGRAPHER:  Four minutes on the tape.

24                   all of that -- you're not getting just

	The reason why you do a water extract

	is you've got loads of sugars and

3
	starches that are in tobacco naturally

4
	mar. l can r ^usr maxe a paper iroirii

5
	So I've got to take that out and

6
	separate it. When I do that, nicotine

7
	comes out with it. Then I am able to

8
	make a paper sheet with the fibers from

9
	tobacco and reapply the extract that I

10
	took off earlier.

11
	It's not reconstituted tobacco until

12
	I put the extract on. If I don't put

13
	the extract on, all I've done is make

14
	paper.

15   Q.
	So, what you're telling me is you take out"-- You use

16
	the water to take a number of the chemicals,

17
	including nicotine, out of tobacco and then at that

18
	point, do you -- is that how you add your additives

19
	into it -- into that vat?

20  A.
	No. You � The reason you do the water extract is so

21
	that you can make the paper sheet.  I can't make the

22
	paper sheet with just ground tobacco.  It's too

23
	sticky, it doesn't come off the roller, it won't

tobacco, put them in a vat, and then I take the fiber

and I make my sheet and then I reapply my extract.

Yes, can I add additives to the extract at that

point? Yep, I sure can. Sometimes you add ammonium

hydroxide, ammoniated compounds, to maintain Ph so

stuff doesn't grow in it, and then put it back on.

Then I have reconstituted tobacco.  If I don't add it

back on, all I made is paper.

Okay. And why do you want a sheet of tobacco?

So I can cut it back up and use it in the cigarette.

Is that how you maintain consistency in your

No, you maintain consistency in your blending philosophy. Recon is part of that, but the recon is only no more than 15 percent, usually, of a blend. So it's a smaller component of the blend structure. Is reconstituted tobacco the only point in the cigarette making process that additives are added to

NO.

When are the additives usually added to a cigarette?

It depends. You case burley tobaccos, so those are

used with -- when you make your blend construct,

there's different parts of tobaccos used.  Burley

tobaccos are cased with sugar and licorice so there   B

I suppose you could distill it, like we talked about,

so potentially, yeah.

Does RJR have the ability to take just about any

chemical it wants to out of cigarettes?

No.

Okay. And why not?

Because it's exceedingly difficult to try to pull a

single chemical out of a mixture of 5,000 with any

degree of accuracy or precision. It's been attempted

a lot.  I spent a good deal of time, myself, trying

to do that. But, no, you can't do that.

When the extract is taken out of tobacco, how is it

applied back on the tobacco sheet?

It's sprayed on the sheet.

Okay,  is it sprayed -- How is it sprayed?

It's sprayed using nozzles over conveyers before you

make the bobbins of reconstituted tobacco.

Is it sprayed evenly on the tobacco?

Yes,

Is all of the extract that is taken out of the

tobacco sprayed back on the tobacco?

Well, it's concentrated back down to the appropriate

I mean, it really depends.  I don't have a formulation of recon in my head. But, you can add � you will add stabilizers because the extract is made and held for several days so it's a water extract, so you don't want things� microbes and things like that growing in it, so you put stabilizers in, you put Ph adjusters, like ammonium hydroxide in, to make sure the Ph is stabilized.

into the extract of recons so I don't have that

answer for you.  It's a knowable answer.  It's in our

disclosures to the FDA, but I just don't know it as

I'm sitting here.

Is ammonia added in the extract phase?

If it's going to be added at all, that's where it

will be added, yeah.

What other chemicals are added in the extract phase?

I think there's other stabilizers that are added at

that point, there may be other salts that are put in.

So, again, I don't know off the top of my head.

Glycerin may be added at that point.  It really

depends.  I don't know all the formulas.

What are stabilizers?

Things like Ph stabilizers.  Right? So, you don't

want the Ph to change, crash out a solution, so you

try to stabilize your formula so the extract remains

-- the solubles remain soluble. And then when

you - you have to- concentrate down - you have to

use a lot of water to get the solubles out and you

need to reduce the amount of water before you reply

it back on so that there may be things added at that

point.

Do you know what the names of the stabilizer

chemicals are?

12
	A.
	We don't control the Ph in tobacco smoke.

13
	Q.
	I thought you just said you added stabilizers to

14
	
	control the Ph?                                  |

	Of the extract?                                 . |

17
	A.
	Yeah.  Because if the Ph of your aqueous solution

1 0
	
	changes, it changes the solubility of the materials

19
	
	mar. are in tnst solution ano rney come crasnmg out.

	Also, Ph may or may not -- well, can inhibit the

22
	
	you would need to maintain the Ph.  It's not for

1        side of the TIRC?

2   A.  The CTR, as it turned in, was the grant and aid

3        foundation that granted moneys for research.

4   Q.  And were both the TI and the CTR funded .by, or at

5        least partially funded by, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

6        Company?

/       i\,       inar s my unciersL.eno.ing, yes.

8   Q.  How was the funding of the TI and the CTR split up

9        between the tobacco industry?

10   A.  I don't know if they split it up directly related to

11        market share, but it certainly had something to do

13        any given time.

14   Q.  So the bigger the market share, the more the company

15        would have contributed to both the TI and the CTR?

16   A.  I think that's my understanding, yeah. At least

17        that's what I remember. Like I said, it's been a

18        while since I've thought about TIRC or CTR and all

19        that stuff, but it's my understanding that the larger

20        companies, like American, I think, for instance,

21        would have had a larger contribution at that time

22        than, say, Philip Morris or Reynolds.

23   Q.  And your understanding comes from your -- at least in

24        part, your year of reviewing internal tobacco company

25        documents and the years you have spent testifying and

14   Q.  Was the tobacco industry involved with Hill+Knowlton

15        prior to 1953?

16   A.  I'm sure somebody was, yeah.  Hill+Knowlton was a

17        public relations firm, so I'm sure a number of large

18        companies utilized Hill+Knowlton.

19   Q.  Was Hill+Knowlton utilized by the tobacco companies

20        after 1953?

21   A.  I believe so, if my memory serves, in terms of that

6
	
	Hill+Knowlton after or prior to that.

7

8
	
	They were the PR firm that at least

9
	
	some of the companies must have

1        and that the information that was collected was

2        enough to say it would cause, so you could act from a

3        public health perspective.  It doesn't mean the old

4      . - ways in which you determine cause, and effect were

5        null and void and certainly TI and the tobacco

6        companies believed you had to have things like you

7        had to know what the causative agents were in order

8        to establish cause and effect, and you had to know

9        what the mechanism of disease causation was before

10        you could affirmatively establish cause and effect,

11        and it would certainly be really handy to have an

12        animal model that actually worked so you could test

13        different designs and test different scientific

14        hypotheses, so they hung with that definition for

15        quite some time.

16   Q.  And if they stayed with that definition today, would

17        they still say that there is no cause and effect?

18                 MR. KREINER: Objection to the form.

19                  THE WITNESS: They never said there was

20                   no cause and effect. They said that

21                   cause and effect had not been

22                   established.  That's a very different

23                   statement.

1        today would be. Certainly, we have more information

2        than they did, certainly, in the 60fs or even when it

3        was dissolved in the 9Q's, but I don't know what

4        their position would be today.  There's certainly a

5        lot more -- and I don't know if you know this or not,

6        but there is certainly more mechanistic understanding

7        of cancer formation today than there was even in 1998

8        when TI was dissolved.

9   Q.  Did TI use epidemiology at all?                                                 |

10   A.  Sure. They -- Certainly, all the tobacco companies

11        in TI recognized that there was a statistical

12        association between cigarette smoking and

13        specifically lung cancer. But, it's, again, a very

14        different proposition to suggest that statistical    |

15        association alone was enough to prove cause and

16        effect. And that's, in essence, what the TI was

17        saying.

18   Q.  Can we prove cause and effect today under the old

19        standard of the TI?        '

20                 MR. KREINER: Objection to form.

21                  THE WITNESS: You would be a lot closer

22                   because you know more mechanistically

23                   what is happening.  Is it -- Would it

24                   completely satisfy the older standards?

 don't necessarily know what the

5

13

1        smoke in 1964, correct?

2   A,  No.  No, you knew there were a couple.  You knew

3        there were three or four. I can't remember what the

4        count was.  But in '64, I think Rodgman said there

5        were 15 identified PAH's, some of them were

6        carcinogens.  You knew that there were a couple of

7        carcinogens in smoke.  The big issue was, at that

8        time, is nobody knew what was going on because you

9        could measure ~- everybody said it was BaP in the

10        50's, benzo[a]pyrene.  That's a carcinogen, a known

11        carcinogen that's in smoke. Well, Wynder and

12        Hoffmann did experiments on the amount of BaP you

13        could find in cigarette smoke and they realized, huh,

14        there's not enough there to cause the skin painting

15        results.  So now where does that lead you? The one

16        thing you find isn't responsible for the response in

17        the mouse skin paining so you've got to think of

18        something else.  So you start thinking about

19        co-carcinogens and other things that might help

20        benzo[a]pyrene form, like phenols, for instance, were

21        considered to be co-carcinogens, things that might

22        help other carcinogens form the disease. And that

23        wasn't completely verified either.  So, no, your

24        statement of all the carcinogens that we know today

25        were known in '64, absolutely not, no, that's

2
	Q.
	Who first identified carcinogens in tobacco smoke?

3
	A.
	Well, there was certainly BaP and benzo[a]pyrene type

4
	
	compounds found by � what was the guy's name? I

5
	
	want to say like Rufo (Phonetic) or something like

	that.  Some Brazilian scientist or an Italian

7
	
	scientist, I can't remember right now.

8
	
	But, certainly, Reader's Digest talked about

9
	
	benzo(a)pyrene in 1950, in an article in 1950, so

10
	
	probably in the 40's those compounds were identified,

	of studies that were coming out in the early 50's,

4                  MR. KREINER: Objection to the form.       |

5                  THE WITNESS:  For me, my whole life.

6                   There's not been a time that I didn't

7                   think cigarette smoking caused disease.

8                   That's what I was taught in school,

9                   what I was taught growing up.  I had

10                   two grandparents die of emphysema from

11                   cigarette related diseases.  I never

12                   questioned it once.

13   Q.  When you were growing up, did you know more about

14        cigarette smoking than R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

15   A.  I couldn't imagine that I would. But I'm not a

16        scientist either -- I didn't grow up as a scientist.

17        So that's a very different question.  So, who are you

18        talking to? Are we talking about me as a person,

19        growing up, or are we talking about scientific or

20        scientists; that's very different.

21   Q.  Well, when you were growing up, what was R.J,

22        Reynolds Tobacco Company's position on whether or not

23        smoking causes lung cancer?

24   A.  Well, their position would have been that there's an

25        association between cigarette smoking and disease,

1        but you couldn't necessarily establish that it was a

2        cause and effect relationship because there wasn't

3        enough information. Now, as time moved on and as I

4        grew up, that position would have changed slightly.

5        Certainly, by the late 80's and early 90's, R.J.

6        Reynolds would have suggested that it was a

7        significant risk factor in the development of

8        disease, which, in fact, it is.

9           And, in fact, if you want to break it down

10        scientifically, what you can really say about smoking

11        and health is that it is a significant risk factor in

12        the development of certain diseases. Now, it's not

13        like getting the flu.

14   Q.  So, you're saying that today we can't say whether or

15        not smoking causes lung cancer?

19   Q.  What are you saying?

20   A.  I'm saying, scientifically, when you look at the

21        information, that it is a significant risk factor in

22        the development of those diseases.  That doesn't mean

23        you're going to get that disease.  There's a lot of

24        smokers out there that never get those diseases so

25        that's why I say it's not like getting the flu.  If

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I think it's like ten percent, something like that. Ten percent of lung cancer is not caused by smoking? I think that's the number. I could be wrong. It could be higher than that. Could it be lower than that?

Possibly, but for some reason I'm thinking it's like 10 or 15 percent.

So 90 percent of lung cancer is caused by smoking? I believe that is correct. Well, certain types of lung cancer. Right? I mean, not �� It depends on what you're talking about. Certainly, the smoking related cancers. How many lung cancers do you know of are not caused

Well, I don't believe that like mesothelioma is a cigarette smoking related disease. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't -- I think that's an asbestos related type of lung disease, so that may be what I'm thinking of in my head. .

As a corporate representative for R.J. Reynolds, would you agree that it is important to put public interest, public health interest, first and foremost? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form;

Yeah, personally as a scientist?

That's one, certainly, definition of it.  I mean, I

Okay. And do you know when Demos died?

1995, if I remember correctly.

Was every RJR manufactured cigarette during that

timeframe, did it contain nicotine?

It would have, yes. .

Migration -- Will you explain to me what migration

is?

Sure, we talked about this earlier. Migration

strategy is around providing products, tobacco

products, for consumers to consider, with the hope

that people who are using the most risky tobacco

products, which would be cigarettes, would hopefully

migrate to products that may have lower risk, like

smokeless tobacco, for instance.

Does migration work the other way around, too, where somebody would go from a less risky product to a more risky product?

Our experience, and what I've seen in the scientific literature, is that has not occurred to this point. What is the most efficient nicotine delivery device on the market today?

MR. KREINER:  Objection to form.

THE WITNESS:  I don't know that there is one. Do you know, as a scientist, how long it takes for nicotine to go from the lungs to the brain? From the lung to the brain, it's a matter of seconds, it's my understanding, or parts of a second. Is there any other delivery of nicotine that is more efficient than that? Intravenous injection is.

So if you injected it, the only way to get a faster way to the brain would be to inject it in your arm? I believe that is the most efficient way,.from my understanding of the science.

Do you know anybody who injects nicotine into their system? As a course of habit, I don't know, but I know it's

How long does it take for nicotine in a Snus to get

to the brain?

A matter of moments. It goes through the veinous

blood system and has to go through the liver, so it's

processed differently than if you inhale cigarette

smoke, for instance.

Is the delivery of nicotine through Snus as efficient

as a traditional cigarette?

MR. KREINER: Object to.the form. THE WITNESS: It depends on what you

mean by efficient.  It is efficient.

It certainly goes through the blood, . In fact, it stays in your blood stream

much longer than say a cigarette would,

the nicotine from a cigarette. Does the Snus ~- the way that nicotine gets into the body through Snus the same way that nicotine gets into the body through like Nicorette gum? Yes.

Do -- Does R.J. Reynolds market their nontraditional tobacco products? Yes.

Do they advertise for their nontraditional tobacco products?

12

	Look, I'm not a marketing expert, but my

13
	
	understanding is we market to adult tobacco consumers

16

	A tobacco user is a tobacco user, whether they've

2
	
	been using it for three months or three years.  I'm

3
	
	not sure how you differentiate that either, other

4
	
	than taking surveys, to make a determination whether

5
	
	they're, you know, a -- how long they've been using

6
	
	tobacco products.

7
	Q.
	But, do you know of any advertisement-of traditional

o
	
	tobacco products that says, you know, this is only

9
	
	for current users of,tobacco or users of tobacco?

10
	A
	Sure.  I mean, all of our adult only facilities that

11
	
	we do marketing face-to-face with consumers, those

12
	
	are the questions that are asked before they're

13
	
	allowed into the booth or before we talk to them. As

14
	
	a matter of fact, the other direct means of marketing

15
	
	that I'm aware of are trade reps on the street who

16
	
	actually observe consumers buying tobacco products.

17
	
	When that observation is made, they will then

18
	
	approach them and talk about our products.  So, yeah,

19
	
	that's an example.

	There are some magazine ads from time to time, yes,

1                   I'm aware of that.

2   Q.  Do those ads differentiate between a tobacco user and

3        a non tobacco user?

4   A.  Obviously, in a magazine ad, you couldn't make that

5        differentiation. What you do and what rules that

6        R.J. Reynolds follows are those that are in the

7        master settlement agreement, where surveys are

8        conducted on I think at least an annual basis on what J

9        the adult readership is of a particular magazine that �

10        we would advertise. And those criteria are that the

11        adult readership has to be, I believe/ 85 percent

14   Q.  Part of the master settlement agreement is not that

15        you just market to users of tobacco, correct?

16                 MR. KREINER:  Objection; form.

17                  THE WITNESS: Our basic policy is to

19                   Obviously, there is no guarantee that

20                   you can -- if you put a magazine ad in

21                   a magazine that you "-- that Only

22                   tobacco consumers would see it.

23                   Obviously, that can't be assured.

24   Q.  Well, wouldn't you run out of new consumers if you

25                   didn't  advertise?

1   A.  I don't know if you would run out of new� I mean,

2        there's over 45 million smokers in this country.

3        It's a pretty large market. We have a small percent

4        -- well, we have a percentage of that in our

5        portfolio. We would prefer to have more of that

6        percentage � of people who continue to use tobacco

7        products. And that's what our marketing and our

8        advertising is aimed at.

9   Q.  Does R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company market and

10        advertise e-cigarettes?.

15                 MR. KREINER: Objection to the form.

16                 THE WITNESS:  I believe that that's a

17                  possibility, just as there's people

18                  under age that use all tobacco products

19                  or just the same way as people who are.

20                  not of age drink, That happens. I'm

3   Q.  Are you aware that over the last two or three years

6                 MR. KREINER: Objection to form,

7                 THE WITNESS: Well, it depends on what

8                  you mean by dramatic. I mean, a

9                  doubling of use, starting from a base

10                  of zero is not necessarily that much,

11                  My understanding of the actual data is 1z                                      tnat rnere are still more aoioi.es cents

13                  that would be using or trying

14                  traditional tobacco products than

15                  e-cigarettes. But I am aware that the .

16                  number of reported adolescents trying

17                  or using e-cigarettes has increased.

18                  But, I don't know that that wouldn't be

19                  an � that that's an unexpected result,

20                  considering the fact that e-cigarette

21                  market has grown in the intervening

22                  years,

23   Q.  What has RJR, or what has R,J. Reynolds done to

1        age verification and age restrictions for the

2        purchase of e-cigarettes, which is not necessarily

3        the case in every state. We supported those efforts,

4        We also support possession laws being passed by

5        states, so if youth are found to be :in possession of .

6        tobacco products that there is a penalty for that.

7        We obviously put our cigarettes in gas and

8        convenience outlets that support the We Card Program.

9        We specifically state that these products are adult

10        consumer products and they should be sold the same

11        way that cigarettes should be sold, which is through

12        age verification. So those are the types of measures

13        that we have looked at and implemented,

14   Q.  Are you aware that the usage of e-cigarettes for

15        under age youth has tripled in the last three years?

16   A.  I believe we just talked about that. Again, if your

17        base is one, then to triple you need four, and that's

18        what we're talking about here. The bigger concern

19        for me is -- or -- is if the e-cigarette use amongst

20        adolescents has tripled, has the.traditional

21        cigarette dropped in the same manner, because if it

22        were up to me, I would much prefer the thought of an

23        adolescent, if they're going to try a risk-taking

24        behavior, that they would try e-cigarettes as opposed

25        to regular cigarettes.

1   Q.  But, we don't know what the long term health effects

2        of e-cigarettes are, do we?

3   A,  We don't definitively know, but we certainly know an

4        awful lot about what the e-cigarette aerosol looks

5        like and from a scientific perspective it seems that

6        it would most assuredly present less risk than

7        cigarette smoking.  �_

8   Q.  So, I'm going to go back to my question. Are you

9        aware that the e-cigarette market -- or the youth use

10        in the e-cigarette market has tripled over the last

11        three years?

12                  MR. KREINER: Object to form/ asked and

13                   answered.

14                  THE WITNESS:  I don't know about

15                   tripling,  I do know it has increased.

16                   I don't remember hearing tripling.  I

17                   believe the last CDC report said it had

18                   doubled.  But, you're saying tripled.

19                   I don't know if that's true or not.  I

20                   know it has increased.

21   Q.  In the last CDC report, do you remember what

22        percentage of youth was using e-cigarettes?

23   A.  I don't, but I do remember it was less than

24        traditional cigarettes.

I believe the last numbers I saw from an incidence perspective was somewhere around 11 or 12 percent nave crxeQ.  it. s acr.uai.xy quire a Die lower man adult incidence rates at this point, Is the youth e-cigarette usage above ten percent? I don't know if it is or not.  I believe the last

8        thing I read about that/ and certainly some questions

9        I had about incidence rates of e-cigarette use, was :

10        the number of adolescents or youth that actually had

11        used traditional tobacco products and were now using

12        e-cigaretteS/ so there was a switching.

13   Q.  A switching from using traditional cigarettes to

14        e-cigarettes is the report that you saw?

15   A.  That's what I remember and that's what I'm recalling/

16        and I believe it was a 60 Minutes news program that

17        actually covered that and talked to kids that -- high

18        school kids -- a high school kid was talked about who

19        smoked cigarettes but now he wasn't smoking

20        cigarettes anymore/ but using e-cigarettes.

21   Q.  Do you know what the initiation rate for strictly

1  A.  I don't. I know the incidence rate, I don't know

4   q.  what is the incidence rate for traditional

5        cicarettes^

6   A.  Currently, adult incidence of tobacco use, I believe,

7        is 18 percent roughly, around 18 percent. For -- The

8        reported adolescent use is south of that.  I can't

9        remember the exact number.  I want to say it was 12

10        and a half, maybe 13.

11   Q.  Do you know what the incidence rate for the

1                   what that testimony was.  The CEO for

2                   Reynolds specifically tried^to say that

3                   nicotine did not meet the classical

4                   definition of an addictive behavior and

5                   he was cut off by the congressman and

6                   the congressman said I'll take that as �7                                        a no.

8   Q.  Okay. And was that R.J. Reynolds' definition of

9        addiction at the time?

10   A.  It was a classical definition. We had no reason and

11        never had disputed that definition when the surgeon

12        general used it in '64. It was only in '88 when the

13        surgeon general decided to have a new definition that

14        there were any questions about it.

15   Q.  Was that R.J. Reynolds' definition of addiction in

16        1964?

17   A.  Yes, they would have agreed with the '64 definition.

18   Q.  In 1988 when the surgeon general came out and said

19        that smoking was addictive, R.J. Reynolds disagreed

20        with that premise; is that correct?

21   A.  They did, but for very specific reasons. One was it

22        equated nicotine with drugs of abuse like heroin and

23        cocaine, another interesting aspect of the definition

24        in 1988 is it removed intoxication completely from

25        the definition of an addictive drug, which had always

. 1                                        and believed that smoking could be very

2                   difficult to quit, that it was a drug

3                   of habituation, just as the surgeon

4                   general classified it as in '64, a drug

5                   of habituation, it would^be difficult

6                   to quit, but certainly people do quit

7                   using cigarettes and nicotine.

8   Q.  Is habituation synonymous with addition?

9   A.  No,  If you've read the '64 surgeon general, he

10        spends almost two chapters on breaking apart the

11        difference between drugs of habituation and drugs of

12        addiction. And that's when the original definition

13        was laid out where I was talking about how there has

14        to be an intoxication associated with drugs of

15        addiction.  That is not how nicotine was classified

16        then, even though there were scientists, and had been

17        scientists for decades prior to '64, that said

18        nicotine was addictive, And the surgeon general even

19        quotes in '64 a couple of papers by individuals that

20        classified nicotine as addiction, but decided that it

21        didn't fit that definition.

22           Johnson, I believe, was the name of the -- one of

23        the names of individuals that the surgeon general in

24        '64 quoted who believed that nicotine was addictive,

1   Q.  Okay. And these receptors in the brain, I believe

2        you testified earlier, they release dopamine,

�~J                      \> \J 1 1 "b L �

4   A.  I believe that is correct, yes, and perhaps other

5        enzymes and chemicals.

6   Q.  What does the release of dopamine have on the effect .

7        of somebody's brain? Strike that.

8           What does the effect of dopamine.have on a person?

9   A.  Again, I'm not a pharmacologist, but I believe it's a

10        -- there's a pleasure reaction.

11   Q.  So if someone was to smoke a cigarette and enjoy it,

12  '     it would be because of this release of dopamine in

13        their brain, correct?

14   A.  Well, possibly. I don't know that that's necessarily

15        all there is to it because I certainly know that

16        there have been studies where people derive pleasure

17        from smoking cigarettes that don't contain any

18        nicotine, so I don't know that that's the sole

19        reason. There may be something with smoking that is

20        pleasurable in and of itself.

21   Q,  Can you identify anything specifically, other than

22        the release of dopamine in the brain, as a reason

23        somebody would enjoy smoking?

24   A.  I mean, the whole activity is pleasurable. I don't

25        know -- All I'm saying is I don't know that if all

1        that is known is nicotine attaching to nicotinic               |

2        receptors and the release of dopamine, that it                   j

3        happens, doesn't mean that that's the only chemical         f

4        reaction that's happening in the brain.  It's the one    |

5        that's been identified. What I am aware of are                 I

6        studies that have been conducted where people are            j

7        given cigarettes, cigarettes without nicotine, and          j

8        nicotine containing lozenges or gums, and asked what       f

9        types of products they get the best craving release         j

10        from, and in a couple of different studies, it's been    j

11        shown that people who use or smoke cigarettes that          'j

12        don't contain any nicotine get better craving relieve    f

.     $

14        contains nicotine, which will release dopamine, which    j

15        will get to the brain and all that.  So, there's a           j

16        suggestion that the act of smoking itself is                       j

17        pleasurable.  So there's more to it than just the             j

18        nicotine.                                                                                                (

19   Q.  Were any of these studies done of nonsmokers?                     |

20   A.  No, I believe they were all smokers and looking to           I

21        see what kind of craving relief they would have, so        f

22        that's a way of measuring, or attempting to measure         |

23        somebody who has already been using tobacco products,     f

weix, you saio. me lozenges go mrougn me xiyer, dux. if you inhale, it goes through your lung? Correct, it goes -- So, when you inhale, it goes through your lung, it goes through the arterial blood, which goes to the brain faster.  If you get it through your buccal membranes in.your mouth or skin, which would be your dermal membranes for a patch, it goes through veinous blood, which does travel through the liver, and what that means is it doesn't get into your blood stream as quickly as arterial blood. But, that doesn't mean it's not there, it still reaches your brain.  So there is a big difference when somebody uses � well, I think it's quite interesting and telling when somebody says they have better craving relief from a cigarette that doesn't contain any nicotine, versus chewing on nicotine containing gum.

1        nicotine receptors in the brain in the same way that

2        smoking traditional cigarettes affects the nicotine

3        receptors in a person's brain?

4   A.  I presume it would.  I mean, it's still nicotine at

5        the end of the day, isn't it? It's got a different

6        salt, but as soon as you put it in your;mouth and it

7        dissolves and goes in your blood stream just like

8        nicotine delivered from a cigarette. The difference

9        is the speed in which it gets to the brain is my

10        understanding,  I don't think speed is going to

11        change the chemical reaction or thelaffinity for

12        those receptors for nicotine so I presume that once

13        nicotine is attached to a nicotinic receptor, then

14        whatever chemical reaction is going to proceed from

15        there is going to continue to proceed.

	it has been done historically on a number of

1       Q.      Why don't the denicotinized cigarettes sell on the         j

3   A.  Well, because when you take the nicotine out, I think j

4        as I mentioned before, during the extraction process  f

5        you're removing not just the nicotine, no matter how  J

6        careful or precise you try to be. And what that does J

� � � ��                                                � �                                               f.

7        is that certainly takes away the flavor attributes of I

8        the tobacco in and of itself and, therefore, those    j

�  ,   � � .  'i

9        cigarettes don't taste very good. Now, that's not to f

10        say that somebody, and maybe Reynolds, one day might  |

11        be able to make a cigarette that is denicotinized    j

12        that is consumer acceptable, but in our minds it             'I

�                  I

13        hasn't been done yet, '�..                                                                 1

15        denicotinized cigarette is because it can't --'it     f

16        won't sell in the marketplace?                                                   J

17   A.  Well, I mean, we are a for profit company and we do   j

18        make products that we intend to sell and our        f

19        consumers have an expectation they are going to like  f

20        those products. So one of your objectives as a      \

I

22        buy and like. As it applies to denicotinized        j

23        cigarettes, I don't believe Reynolds has accomplished j

	Well, again, I think I already talked about the

4
	
	craving relief studies,  I think that's .obviously not

5
	
	the case.  I think, certainly, nicotine is expected

6
	
	by smokers, so in some cases, there may be smokers

7
	
	that certainly want nicotine.  If your premise was

8
	
	absolutely correct, that all smokers ever wanted was

9
	
	nicotine, then Nicorette gum should be flying off the

10
	
	shelf, because you could get all the nicotine you'd

11
	
	want from that, and more now that it's

12
	
	over-the-counter, but that's not the case.

13
	Q.

	But, it does go into the body and it does go to the

17
	
	brain and you can measure nicotine in the blood

18
	
	stream. And, as a matter of fact, when nicotine is

19
	
	in the blood stream, it stays in the blood stream

20
	
	much longer than the nicotine you get from a

21
	
	cigarette, so it does work and it does happen. And,

22
	
	certainly, no one is going to say here that Nicorette

23
	
	gum doesn't work.

24
	Q.
	Do people get addicted to Nicorette gum?

10   A.  It takes longer than a cigarette, for sure.

11   Q,  Does a person who is addicted to smoking smoke more

12        cigarettes than someone who is not addicted to

13        smoking?

14                  MR. KREINER: Objection to the form.

15                  THE WITNESS:  I don't know the answer to

16                  that.

17   Q.  Okay. You don't have an opinion either way, whether

18        an addition to cigarettes increases one's exposure to

19        cigarette smoke?

20   A.  I don't.  I mean, that's another part of the

21        definition that was changed in '88.  If you look at

22        the '64 definition, part of that definition is an

23        ever increasing need for more and more of the drug.

24        You don't find that in cigarette smoking behavior.

25        You see a pretty average use of a pack, pack and a

1        half a day use, whether you're addicted or not

2        addicted. So we don't see that continuing need to

3        have more and more and more of those products.

4   Q.  Well, certainly, you would agree with me that the

5        person who starts smoking does not start smoking one

6        pack a day, correct?

7   A.  Typically, probably not, but, I mean, I can't

8        guarantee that that's not the case for some

9        individuals, but I would say probably not.

10        Certainly, I didn't start smoking a pack a day.

11   Q.  Certainly. You increased to pack a day from a few

12        cigarettes a day, correct?

13   A.  I think that's pretty much how it happened, yeah,

14   Q.  Isn't that relatively typical of how most cigarette

15        smokers start smoking?

16   A,  I would think so, but, again, in terms of an       u

17        addictive behavior, look, I never smoked really more

18        than a pack a day.  I suppose I could have smoked

19        three or four packs a day, but I never did.

20   Q.  And if you started smoking again today, you probably

21        would � aren't going to go back to three cigarettes

22        a day, correct?

23   A,  I don't have any idea what I would do, as I don't

24        plan on smoking cigarettes.

25   Q.  Let me kind of circle back to my question. Do

	that your premise is fundamentally flawed because if  j

5
	
	way down. The cigarette use in the 80's was over a

6
	
	pack, over 20 a day; today it's about 13. And if

1   A.  Right, same.

2   Q.  We agree that nicotine, is addictive?

3   A.  Absolutely, I agree that nicotine is considered

4        addictive. And I think it's considered addictive

�5      whether it's -- personally, whether it's in Nicorette

6        gum or in Snus or in cigarettes.

7   Q.  And addiction makes it harder for a person to quit o      usiny Lnar proQuCL, correcr.

9      A,  I would say that's part of the definition, yes.

10   Q.  And that would result in a person using the product

11        more than a person who was not addicted, correct?

12                  MR. KREINER: Objection; form,

13                  THE WITNESS: No, that is not true.

14   Q.  All right. Explain to me where I'm --what I'm

15        missing,

16   A.  It would make it a much more difficult .proposition,

17        which doesn't mean that you're going to smoke longer

18        or smoke more.  It means that you are definitely

19        going to have to be committed to quitting, and that

20        is different. There are people who are not addicted

21        who may smoke cigarettes and just one day, if they

22        not addictive, they just put them down as if nothing

23        happened. My suggestion is somebody who is addicted

24        is going to have a harder time to do that, they're

25        going to have to spend more time and remind

	themselves not to do it in order to quit.  It's a

2
	
	more difficult proposition.  But, it doesn't take

3
	
	away your will or your desire or whether or not

4
	
	you're going to be successful at doing it.

5
	Q.
	No, addiction just makes it harder to quit, right?

6
	A.
	I think it makes it harder to quit, but that doesn't

7
	
	mean once you've decided that you're going to quit

8
	
	and you have that successful attempt, that you put

9
	
	your mind to it. The same kind of premise has to

10
	
	happen in order for you to quit, whether you're

11
	
	addicted or not addicted.

12
	Q.
	And it also doesn't mean that you aren't going to

13
	
	relapse, correct?

14
	A.
	I mean, I think there's always a chance that people

15
	
	are going to relapse.

21
	
	easier to relapse when you're not

Well, I don't know that we would use the term relapse

outside of the context of addiction, correct?

I thought we just were.

Well, do you --never mind, I'm going to move on.

Can R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company make its traditional cigarettes less addictive? That, I don't know,  I don't know how to do that,  I don't know where the line would be, in terms of how much nicotine would have to be removed or whether or not there's even a line that would suggest this product would not be addictive.  I don't think that's been scientifically established.

Can R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company make a traditional cigarette that's more addictive?

Again, same problem.  I don't know where that would be and I would add there is way more nicotine in a cigarette than is absorbed by the smoker. So, at the end of the day, when you look at the pharmacokinetic data, there is only a small fraction of nicotine that is actually absorbed and gets into the blood stream of a smoker who smokes and inhales cigarette smoke. What happens when the nicotine receptors in a smokers brain are not receiving an adequate dose of nicotine? I don't know. Do they become more active?

And the person or the group that was putting out the

other side of the argument was the tobacco industry,

correct?

Again, not solely. Certainly, the Tobacco Institute

would talk about and publicize those other scientists

that would have a different take on what the statics

would suggest.

You wouldn't call that a controversy?,

I don't know if you would call it a controversy.  I

suppose it could be considered a controversy, but to

me it's typical of what happens in the world of

science. When you change basic thinking in science,

there is always debate about whether it was better to

be -- to use the old rules or the new rules. When

germ theory came about and disease causation, that

was not readily accepted, and for decades there was

debate.  So I mean, this is the progress of how

science worjes,

When � I mean, are there studies in the 70/s, 80's,

and 90's, that support the position that smoking does

not cause health consequences?

No, and you have to remember the tobacco industry

always recognized that the statics were there and

that they were concerned.  There's a difference

1        between -- but, there is a difference between

2        recognizing that there is a statistical association

3        and whether or not you can definitively link cause

4        and effect. That's what the debate was and, frankly,

5        it was quite important for the tobacco industry to

6        understand what those causative agents were, how the

7        mechanism of lung cancer occurred and have an actual

8        animal modern that one could actually rely on and

9        use. The absence of those three things, it was very

10        difficult to � certainly, in the tobacco's

11        industry's mind -- to establish cause and effect.

12        Typically, it's difficult.

13   Q.  Why was it so difficult for the tobacco industry to

14        accept that smoking causes ill health effects?

15   A.  Because ~~ I'll say again. Classically, the way

16        disease was classified as a cause and effect

17        relationship for those diseases that are chronic in

18        nature such as lung cancer and has multiple causes,

19        one has to previously establish that one is a

20        statistical association, which that was part of it,

21        but then you have to have the plausibility, and

22        plausibility through an understanding of the

23        mechanism and an understanding of what those agents

24        were in the smoke that would cause the damage and the

25        disease, and an ability to test alternative changes.

3        fine, but mouse skin painting was not lung. Okay?

4        Painting tar on the backs of mice is not the same

There was ambiguity because from a scientific

perspective there was ambiguity. So, Reynolds said what they believed that their scientists believed you could support, there may be a risk factor/there is association between smoking and disease; that is true, but to say that there is a direct cause and effect, they were unclear.

Did Reynolds throughout the 60's, 70's, 80's, and 90's, ever put out any public statements other than the cause and effect relationship hasn't been proven? MR. KREINER:  Objection to the form. THE WITNESS;  I'm sure they put out a bunch of different public statements. I don't know what they were. With regard to the health attributes of cigarette smoking, I don't know what their position would have been.  It's not established.

T? T f"T Vn 4�

They wouldn't have strayed from that, from a public

health perspective.

What changed their perspective in 2000?

I don't know so much that the perspective was changed

as much as continuing data had been collected all

through the 80's and 90's. And certainly by 2000 and

I believe it's been characterized that way, although

I believe obesity may have overtaken smoking at this point, or at least I remember reading that a couple of years ago*

You think obesity is a bigger problem than 480,000 Americans dieing each year from smoking? I'm not saying whether I believe it's a problem or not. I believe that the public health has claimed that there are more deaths from obesity now and obesity related diseases than smoking* In fact, the last I heard a couple of years ago, they said that the numbers were underestimated by over five times, which would put the numbers higher than smoking* Do you know how many people die from obesity each year?

Well, over 400,000.  I believe it was quoted at 120,000 people died from obesity related health troubles and that the CDC came out and said that that was underestimated by four and a half times or something like that, so then multiply 108 by four and that puts you over the smoking rate, But, the CDC didn't put a number on it, did they? No, I believe they did, or somebody had a -- public health, part of the government.  It wasn't my study. Would you agree with me that -- well, when was the

3   A.  The very founding of the company. We didn't make any

4        cigarettes until the early nineteen hundreds.  The

5        company founded in 1875 and made smokeless tobacco

6        and pipe tobacco for decades before they ever made

7              r,icfflT,ettf-,<?

8   Q,  Right. And when did the lung cancer epidemic start � in the United States?

I mean, it's hard to say, but probably lung cancer

rates were noticed to be increasing in the 1940s,    j

just after World War II.

When did the modern cigarette mass production start?

1913.

So.there was a lag there of, what, 30 years before

the lung cancer rates started increasing?

Approximately.

Did the lung cancer rates continue to rise� rise

with the volume of cigarettes that were sold?

That was the start of why people started looking into

the epidemiology of cigarettes and trying to

understand whether or not that association was real.

When was the first time R.J. Reynolds tried to

produce a smokeless tobacco product?

It started out as a smokeless tobacco company.

Okay.

And read the first paragraph of the conclusion and

recommendation.

The concept strategies and plans presented above have

been considered in depth over a period of one year.

After searching analysis, the proposed new strategy

continues to appear useful and it is devised to

provide the consumer what he wants without hazard and

at great potential profit to the supplier.. The

proposed new strategy is also attractive because it

provides a positive opportunity to this corporation

while successfully circumventing problems arising

from the smoking health controversy.

Do you know if any of his proposed products ever made

it into development?

I don't know that they had or not.  I don't believe

so.

	Q.
	Are they hard?

2
	A,
	They are.  The strip is not hard.  It's a small,

3
	
	quickly dissolving film strip,  So that one is not

4
	
	hard, but the stick is hard and the orb is hard.

	It really depends on how you work it. We've done

	Would you agree with me that Mr. Teague is proposing

14
	
	safer alternatives to cigarettes in this document?

15
	A.
	I mean, I would say in general that those

16
	
	propositions, if they were executed, could possibly

17
	
	� could possibly be, yeah.

18
	Q.
	Well, they're not -- I understand they're not exactly

19
	
	the same as the products that R.J. Reynolds is

20
	
	producing today and promoting as safer than the

21
	
	alternative cigarettes, but there is certainly a vary

22
	
	strong correlation. Wouldn't you agree with me, that

23
	
	what he is proposing are safer alternatives to

24
	
	cigarettes that could have been implemented in the

25

5                   that they could have been implemented.

there are certain�certainly, Murray Sankus.  I

know that name, and Colby and I've seen Blevins and

Moraine.

Who was Murray Sankus?

He was the head of R&D.

He is.

Are you comfortable characterizing this as a

proposal?

That's all it is.  It's a book report.  It's a

So Claude Teague is making a proposal to the higher ups in R.J, Reynolds Tobacco Company about safer alternative tobacco products; is that fair?

MR. KREINER: Objection; form.

THE WITNESS: Again, I don't know that. We don't know that. It's certainly what it looks like?

Well -- But, you would expect to have something other than draft if it's going to go to Murray, right? That's a good point.  Did r,j, Reynolds shred a bunch of internal documents during litigation?

MR. KREINER: Objection; form.

THE WITNESS: No, not that I'm aware of. You're not aware of any document destruction that went on R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company; is that your testimony?

No, I'm sure there was plenty of documents that would be disposed of, just like any normal business would. Are you aware of -- well, what was the document retention policy at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company? Well, I can tell you what it is now.  For R&D, the

1        document retention policy is all documents are

2        retained, all correspondence are retained and has

3        been since I've worked for the company, from an R&D

4        perspective.  For other parts of the business, there

5        are document retention schedules, so financial

6        records and things like that can, obviously, be

7        destroyed after a certain number of years elapse. So

8        each department has different criteria, but since

9        I've been working with the company, marketing, law,

10        and R&D have � there is no � the retention policy

11        is to retain it all.

12   Q.  And you don't believe that was the retention policy

13        in the 60's and 70fs?

14   A.  It may very well have been.  I think, certainly, from

15        an R&D library perspective, we've looked into this

16        before, it looks like the documents are well

17        maintained.

18   Q.  Did you also see documents communicating a document

19        destruction in your review of the documents?

20                 MR, KREINER: Objection to form.

21                  THE WITNESS: If you have a document you

22                   want to show me, I can certainly

23                   comment on it.  I've seen a number of

24                   things in the course of litigation.

	I have, yes.                                �     \

3
	Q.
	So is it possible that R.J. Reynolds destroyed

4

5
	
	MR. KREINER: Objection to the form.

6
	
	THE WITNESS: Well, if they did, then

7
	
	\ why wouldn't they destroy the document

8
	
	that discusses the proposal first?       j

9
	
	That's always been my concern and

10
	
	wonder about this premise that always

11
	
	seems to be presented in litigation.
 5

12
	
	So my answer to your question is I'm

13
	
	� \ sure R.J, Reynolds has disposed of

14
	
	thousands of documents. But, as it

 applies to R&D documents, library        |

16
	
	documents, health related documents, I    \

17
	
	don't see evidence of that.  I have not    1

	Are you aware of R.J. Reynolds shutting down any labs

	-- their public message?

	What does that mean, contrary to public message?   j

1                  agreement?

2   A.  Well, I kind of am because I haven't seen any

3        evidence of it. What I know is R.J, Reynolds

4        conducted a lor. or jdiological researcn m r.ne du s,

5        70's, and 80's, and up to today, and what was

6        proposed was that a gentleman's agreement was

7        supposed to not allow that. Although, again, I

8        haven't -- I don't recall seeing any document that

9        talks about what a gentleman's agreement is, or this

10        so called gentleman's agreement.

11   Q.  So you know what the gentleman's agreement was, you

12        just haven't seen a document of the gentleman's

13        agreement?

14   A.  No.  I know what it is based on what plaintiff's

15        attorneys have attempted to explain to me what the

16        gentleman's agreement is. What I haven't seen is any i /                evidence � � any naro evidence -�*" cnar. mar. is rne

18        case. And, in fact, I've only seen the opposite,

19        based on what I know Reynolds did. They had animal

20        labs, they run invitro studies, they -- I've seen

21        records of outside contract research all through the

22         60's, 70's, 80's and 90's of doing biological

23        research conducted by Reynolds, So if such a thing

24        existed, Reynolds didn't abide by it,

25   Q.  I'm going to switch gears a little bit on you.

10                   you quit smoking versus your life is

17        you what the similarities are.  I mean, the surgeon

1        addiction is the same as heroin and cocaine and you

2        just agreed with me that they are differences. And

3        that was, I think, the big point of the tobacco

4        industry at the time saying they are not the same,

5        they are different. There is a difference between

Let me finish, du r e �

So, in a sense of if I ingest something in my body, is it going to have an affect on my body? Yes. So in that sense, they are similar. When I eat food, I get -- pleasure centers get fired in my brain too. But that doesn't mean that I'm going to equate eating chocolate with taking heroin, but that's, what the surgeon general did with cigarettes, so I just don't agree with that.

I agree it's very difficult to quit and that the common definition of what people consider to be adcucxive oenaviors, cigarexxes rail mxo max, ano, i don't dispute that, but that doesn't mean.I think it's the same thing as heroin and cocaine. Well, I'm not sitting here telling you it's the same. The surgeon general did, though.

I'm asking you what the similarities are. All three drugs have withdrawal effects, correct? MR. KREINER: Objection; form. THE WITNESS: Very different withdrawal effects. But, they do have withdrawal effects? They do, sure.

1          BY MR.   GALE:

2   Q.  Dr. Figlar, have you read the 2010 surgeon general's

3        report?

4   A.  I have.  I've reviewed most of the recent surgeon

5        general's reports.

6   Q.  Would you agree with me that the surgeon general's

7        reports are a reliable source of information?

8                 MR. KREINER: Objection to the form.

9                  THE WITNESS:  I mean, I think certainly

10                   there is reliable portions of the

11                   surgeon general's report.  I don't

12                   necessarily agree with everything, but

13                   I think it's a reliable source, I would

14                   say.

15   Q.  On R.J. Reynolds website, they say�or you direct

16        individuals to the surgeon general's reports for

17        information, correct?

18   A.  We do,

19   Q.  Okay.  I'm going to ask you if you agree or disagree

20        with this statement from the 2010 surgeon general's

21        report. Okay? It is, "nicotine addiction is the

22        fundamental reason that individuals persist in using

23        tobacco products." Do you agree or disagree with

24        that statement?

25   A.  I partially agree with that.  I don't know that it is

1        the fundamental.  It's certainly one of the reasons

2        why people would continue to use cigarettes, tobacco

3        products in general.

4   Q.  So you disagree with that statement?

5                 MR. KREINER: Objection to form.

6                  THE WITNESS: I neither disagree or

7                   fully agree.  I don't believe the level

8                   of assertion is necessarily that high,

9                  but it's certainly one of the reasons,

10   Q.  Would you agree that "persistent tobacco use

11        contributes to many diseases"?

12   A.  I would agree that the risk of diseases is increased

13        with persistent use.  I would agree,

14   Q.  Okay.  So you � okay, you agree with the second, but

15        you don't agree or disagree -- you don't disagree and

16        you don't agree with the statement that nicotine

17        addiction is the fundamental reason individuals

18        persist in using tobacco products?

19                       MR. KREINER:  Objection to form; asked 2 0                                                    and answered.

21                  THE WITNESS:  I don't necessarily agree

22                   with that.  I don't think nicotine

23                   addiction is the fundamental reason why

24                   people continue to use cigarettes.

as a person with knowledge about the FDA process; is

that correct?

Sure.  I believe I am.

Okay. And when did R.J. Reynolds become under the

FDA purview?

Well, R.J. Reynolds and the rest of the tobacco

industry was under the purview of the FDA in June of

2009, I believe is when president Obama signed the

statute.

Okay.

I believe it was June.  June or July.

Did R.J. Reynolds lobby against coming under the FDA

MR. KREINER: Objection to the form. THE WITNESS: Not necessarily. We did not like the current statute. We, R.J. Reynolds believed in reason � what we would say was reasonable regulations and supported a different statute that was being proposed; not the one that was signed, however. So the current statute that brings R,J. Reynolds under the FDA was challenged by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, correct?

I don't know. I don't know the total number,.but the smoke chemistry of the aerosol chemistry of Eclipse is simpler than tobacco smoke, so there's not as many chemical constituents. The carcinogens or toxicans that are found in Eclipse aerosol are very much lower than they are in regular cigarette smoke. Are there carcinogens in Eclipse cigarettes smoke? In the smoke, there are.

	Q.
	Does menthol increase one's ability to inhale a

2
	
	ciqarette?

3
	A.
	I would not say that, no. As a non menthol smoker,

4
	
	when I would bum a cigarette from somebody who was a

5
	
	menthol smoker, I had a hard time inhaling menthol

6
	
	because it's very strong in my opinion. So I

7
	
	wouldn't say it increases the ability to inhale.  I

8
	
	think that's, again, a learned behavior.in which you

9
	
	get used to. But, it definitely provides a cooling

10
	
	sensation to your mouth and throat; there's no

	Have you seen any studies that youth are more likely

18
	
	to smoke menthol brand cigarettes than other brands

19
	
	of cigarettes?

20
	A.
	I mean, I think menthol brands are more popular

21
	
	today.  But, realize, of course, that even while

22
	
	menthol brands are more popular than ever today,

23
	
	still two-thirds of the smoking population smokes non

24

	Correct, same level of risk.

	I don't believe so.

	numbing effect.  It's certainly a cooling effect and

8
	start?                                       � i

9  A.
	They started roughly in the 1950's so filters became  j

10
	popular and became more and more implemented from    [

11
	about 1950 onwards, Winston, in 1954, was the first \

12
	largely very popular filtered cigarette.  So really,  j

13
	post '54, filters became more and more prevalent.    j

14
	And I would say the use or increased use of

15
	reconstituted tobacco became more prevalent as well   \

16
	during that period. The use of stems started in the  j

17
	50's, expanded tobacco in the 1960's, filter         \

18
	ventilation in the late 60's, early 70's, so a number |

19
	of techniques were developed, implemented, tested    \

20
	utilized and then put out in the market.

21   Q.
	Let me follow up on the testing component.  I'll     j

22
	first ask you was the fact that Reynolds and other    1

23
	manufacturers were using things like filters and then

24

25

3
	A
	No. Many of them were patented.

4
	Q.
	Did outside either government agencies or members of

�5
	
	the public health community evaluate those various

6
	
	technologies that the companies implemented?

7
	A.
	Many did.  Certainly, reconstituted tobacco was known

8
	
	quite widely to the public.  I mean, it was in the

9
	
	Reader's Digest articles all throughout the 50's.

10
	
	Certainly, all of those techniques that we talked

11
	
	about that were implemented in the 50!s, 60's, and

12
	
	7 0�s, were evaluated by the federal government and

13
	
	the NCI, TWG program, so the National Cancer

14
	
	Institute studied each of those techniques to try to

15
	
	make a determination did it produce lower biological

16
	
	activity. So all of the stuff has been evaluated,

18   A.  That effort was basically a ten-year program kicked

19        off by the federal government through the National

20        Cancer Institute to basically study ways -- the

21        objective of the NCI, TWG explicitly was ways to make

22        a safer cigarette.

	Did members of the public health community

	participate in that effort?

o   .ft. �
	They did, yes.

4  Q.
	Can you just briefly summarize for us what the

5
	conclusions that the NCI, TWG reached after

6
	conclusion of its research program with respect to

7
	the effect of the design techniques we talked about,

8
	filtration, reconstituted tobacco, expanded, and

9
	others, what was their effect on smoke chemistry as

10
	well as potential biological activity effect?

11    A �
	Well, in most cases, or many cases, those

12
	technologies were evaluated favorably through the

13
	NCI, TWG, specifically through the massive animal

14
	testing that was done.  They did an awful lot of

15
	mouse skin painting testing, which was really the

16
	best technique they had available at the time. All

17
	were very positive, especially for reconstituted

18
	tobacco, expanded, filter dilution as well.  They did

19
	massive chemistry studies, tried to understand the

20
	effects of tar in nicotine yields, through the

21
	implementation of those technologies, again favorable

22
	in terms of yield reduction in most cases.

23

	there's five large reports on the subject, hundreds

4
	Q.
	I want to fast forward a little bit to the 2000s

5
	
	timeframe and come back to the issue of what has been

6
	
	done to try to make safer cigarettes in the current

7
	
	decade so to speak. You talked about techniques that

8
	
	were implemented. Did Reynolds research on. trying to

9
	
	make safer products stop in the 60's, 70's, and 80's,

10
	
	or did it continue after that time?

11
	A.
	Oh, no, it continued.

12
	Q.
	It's still going on today inside of Reynolds' R&D

13
	
	laboratories?

14
	A.
	It is still today.

15
	0.
	If Reynolds wanted today to make a change to one of

16
	
	its cigarettes because it thought it had a potential

17
	
	to make smoking less risky or it wanted to make a

18
	
	change for any reason whatsoever, could it do that on

19
	
	its own?

20
	i\,
	No.

21
	Q.
	Why not?

22
	A.
	Because we're regulated by the FDA.

23
	Q.
	And does the FDA allow Reynolds or any other

24
	
	cigarette manufacturers to make any change to its

25
	
	products without receiving FDA approval?

6
	
	additive the company indicated they are using?

�7.
	A.
	If they had a concern about an additive that the

8
	
	companies were using, they were to notify congress

9
	
	and get that additive removed. That was the

10
	
	authority they had with obtaining the list.

	In the I guess almost 30 years that Reynolds and the

12
	
	other manufacturers have been providing their

	What is the purpose or what is the consequence of

13
	A.
	Well, yeah. Well, in some types of reconstituted

14
	
	tobacco sheet, you end up getting more what you would

15
	
	call smoky or nutty roasted flavors developing.

16
	
	Ammonia sugar chemistry is quite a well known

17
	
	phenomenon in food and other industries and these

18
	
	reactions, called mallard reactions, happen when

19

20
	
	pleasant from an aroma standpoint and a taste

	increasing certain flavorful compounds, why don't you

	use it in all forms of reconstituted tobacco sheet

	and all cigarettes?

4
	i\.
	Well, it doesn't always -- it's not one shoe fits

5
	
	everything.  Specifically, for menthol products,

6
	
	those nutty dark aromas don't really go that well

7
	
	with menthol products, so that's one where the shoe

8
	
	doesn't fit.

9
	Q.
	With respect to ammonia, are you aware of any public

10
	
	health authority, whether it's the FDA or anyone

11
	
	else, that has concluded that a cigarette with added

12
	
	ammonia is more dangerous or addictive than a

13
	
	cigarette without added ammonia?

14
	A.
	Never have I seen any documentation which would

15
	
	suggest that.

16
	Q.
	Okay. And I apologize, looping back to reconstituted

17
	
	tobacco sheet.  Have you seen that the FDA or any

18
	
	other government or public health authority, to your

19
	
	knowledge, concluded that the use of reconstituted

20
	
	tobacco sheets make cigarettes more dangerous or more

21
	
	addictive than they already are?

22
	A.
	Certainly nothing on addictive. Quite the opposite.

23
	
	I mean, the government agency and CTI-TWG concluded

24
	
	that the use of reconstituted tobacco was ~- gave

1        would be the opposite.

2   Q.  Now, I want to switch topics a little bit, but I want

3        to stay on the same sort of topic.  You were asked

4        some questions about carcinogens in tobacco and

5        tobacco smoke.  Let me first start out with does

6        Reynolds add carcinogens to its cigarettes?

7   A.  No, we do not.

8   Q.  To your knowledge, has it ever done so?

9   A.  Not that I'm aware of, no.

10   Q.  Why are there carcinogens present in tobacco smoke?

11   A.  Carcinogens are in tobacco smoke because when you

12        burn organic material, you generate carcinogens

13        through the combustion.-- through incomplete

14        combustion. That's,what I was trying to explain

15        before. You burn anything, any organic material,

16        really, you're going to form things like benzine and

17        PAH's and other things that are known to be

18        carcinogenic. So it's the consequence of the burning

19        is why you have such a high amount of carcinogens.

20        Now, there are some carcinogens that are in tobacco

21        from the degradation of nicotine and those things are

22        called nitrosamines, the ones in tobacco are specific

23        to tobacco, tobacco specific nitrosamines, and z~i       mere s a coupie or rnose mar. are carcinogenic. /\nct 25      they are there before you set it on fire. And

1        there's heavy metals in tobacco. Why? Because

2        they're in the soil and it's a growing plant and it

3        picks them up, so things like cadmium, which may be a

4        carcinogen, can be found in tobacco and in tobacco

5        smoke, but that is, again, inherent in the tobacco.

6   Q.  In your opinion, doctor, and as someone who is in

7        charge of cigarette product development at Reynolds,

8        does anything Reynolds does to the cigarettes

9        increase the amount of carcinogens in cigarettes?

10   A.  No, and we specifically, through our product

11        stewardship program, when we do new designs or issue

12        out new products or try to make- changes to the

13        product, we specifically look to make sure that we

14        don't increase that risk. That's what the whole

15        point of the stewardship program is about.

16   Q.  As it relates to general reduction in the techniques x /                  tfiat we discussed and me overall eiions to reduce

18        tar and nicotine over time, did those general

19        reduction techniques have an effect on the

20        carcinogens and the yield of carcinogens in cigarette

21        smoke?

22   A.  Yeah.  I mean, general reduction techniques generally

23        reduce everything to do with tar, and specifically

24        the toxicants and carcinogens in that tar, so it

25        serves to reduce them.

1  Q.
	With respect to carcinogens that are naturally

2
	present in the tobacco plant itself, I think you

3
	mentioned nitrosamines. Did Reynolds discover any

4
	means to actually reduce the amount of naturally

5
	forming carcinogens, TSNA's, in flu-cured tobacco?

6  A.
	On the flu-cured side, we sure did, yeah.

7   Q.
	Can you just briefly tell the jury about Reynolds1

8
	efforts to dramatically reduce the inherent

9
	carcinogens that are in the TSNA's?.

10  A.
	Sure.  The flu-cured tobacco is tobacco that is grown

11
	and cured in a barn by using heat. That heat is

12
	usually supplied through some type of flame.  Back in

13
	the old days, it was wood burning indirect fire that

14
	would dry the tobacco and it would be cured that way

16
	it was found that TSNA levels were increasing in

17
	flu-cured tobacco and Reynolds investigated where the

18
	cause of that increase would be. And as it turns

19
	out, what was happening was the farmers were

20
	recycling the exhaust on their generators for the

21
	propane heaters and that exhaust, which was, again,

22
	an economic savings perspective on fuel costs ended

23
	up containing nitrogen oxides which helped to

24
	propagate that nicotine degradation and form

25
	nitrosamines.  So Reynolds, once they figured out

	what the source and the cause of the increase was,    |

2
	
	devised the mechanisms in ways in which the farmers   |

3
	
	could use an indirect heating method with the propane f

7
	
	tobacco itself and increase that yield of TSNA. So   I

8
	
	Reynolds came up with that methodology and helped    j

9
	
	farmers convert their barns.                      \

10
	Q.
	So just to step back a minute, Reynolds discovered    f

11
	
	that something tobacco farmers were doing was leading \

12
	
	I;
 to an increased amount of tobacco specific          1

	nitrosamines?                                  f

	It wasn't something that Reynolds was doing?         |

16
	A�
	Nothing to do with Reynolds, no.                  j

17
	Q.
	And after making its discovery, Reynolds made the   . j

18
	
	results of that research known and helped farmers"    |

19
	
	convert their barns to a technology that wouldn't     f

20
	
	lead to that increase in TSNA is that right?        |

21
	A.
	That's correct.  In fact, we made the technology     |

22
	
	available to the industry and shared that technology

23
	
	with everybody else in the tobacco industry and all   \

	continue talking about smoke constituents and its    I

	whether Reynolds lists constituents to cigarette

2
	A.
	Sure.

3
	Q.
	You mentioned this -- or you discussed with Mr. Gale

4
	
	several times the 1964 surgeon general's report. Did

5
	
	the surgeon general's report at that time discuss the

6
	
	fact that there are carcinogens in cigarettes?

7
	A.
	Sure.

8
	Q.
	You made reference to Reader's Digests from the 50's

9
	
	and benzo(a)pyrene. Did Reader's Digest in the

9
	
	Williamson, American, and Lorillard, since January 1,

10
	
	1966, would have contained either a caution label or

11
	
	a warning; is that correct?

12
	A.
	Every single one of them, yes.

13
	Q.
	And did that warning label also appear in cigarette

	grandfathered products.  Let me ask you this, doctor.

18
	
	The fact that the FDA regulations have a provision

19
	
	for grandfathered products and what the date of that

20
	
	product is -- what those product are -- and the fact

21
	
	that changes can't be made to commercial products

22
	
	without FDA approval, was that up to congress or was

23
	
	that up to Reynolds to decide?

24
	A.
	That was up to congress.

25
	Q.
	You mentioned that Reynolds -- I'll cover this

1        briefly. You mentioned that Reynolds supported a

2        different bill that provided for regulation of

3        tobacco products. What were some of the issues that

4        Reynolds had with the legislation that was passed and

5        why it thought a different alternative bill would

6        have been better?

7   A.  Well, a couple of key points in the current bill, the

8        way it was constructed, it made it very difficult to

9        implement innovations on tobacco products.  That is

10        the situation we're facing right now is it's almost

11        virtually impossible at this point in time to

12        innovate against the products. R.J. Reynolds was not

13        in favor of that type of legislation because what

14        that does is effectively lock the market down, and it

15        was favorable for Philip Morris, which has over

16        50 percent of the cigarette market, and, in fact, the

17        current legislation is what Philip Morris supported,

18        not the version that we supported.  So that was

19        essential to that. And the other thing is because it

20        made it difficult to innovate, it conflicted

21        significantly with Reynolds' harm reduction and

22        overall company strategy to transform the tobacco

23        industry.  So, remember what was happening at that

24        time.  Reynolds was putting out things like Snus and

25        dissolvables and trying to implement a migration

1
	
	strategy and this type of statute makes those        f

2
	
	activities very difficult to accomplish.  So that's   |

3
	
	why we supported a more liberal means by which       1

4
	
	innovation could get to the market, but still what we \

5
	
	would consider to be reasonable regulation and didn't \

	lock the market down and give Philip Morris a       j

8
	Q.
	To be clear, although Reynolds was not in favor of

9
	
	the bill that ultimately passed, did it nonetheless

10
	
	support a bill that does provide for regulations in   j

	the industry?                             '        I

	It did, yes.  It didn't win, though..           '   |

	And under the current FDA bill, are there certain    j

	disclosure requirements, document requirements, data  j

	requirements, as well as other authority that FDA has j

	over Reynolds and other cigarette manufacturers?     j

	Sure, yes, absolutely.                         . ' j

	And has Reynolds complied with the disclosure

19
	
	requirements and document requirements, even though   j

20
	
	it came up under a bill that it may not have agreed

21
	
	with?

22
	A.
	Sure.  It's a law. We have to abide by that and we

	do.  There's disclosure, regulations, health document |

	e-cigarettes. We touched on this earlier, about

	Reynolds' position that kids shouldn't use electronic

3
	
	cigarer-res .  i m going no exreno. our discussion a

4

	do you recall that?

7
	A.
	i do,

	Q.
	Have you heard of any reported cases of e-cigarette

	No, they are not.

15
	Q.
	Okay.  I want to talk about the VUSE product, R.J.

	Reynolds' product in a moment, but can you just

17
	
	describe for us how -- what the different types of

	e-cigarettes are that are on the market today and

19
	
	then we're going to contrast that with Reynolds'

	product?

21
	A t
	Sure.  The e-cigarette market has gone through a

22
	
	variety of changes really in the past few years.

23
	
	When it started, they were basically -- the most

24
	
	popular types of e-cigarettes were disposable

25
	
	e-cigarettes.  They were a small battery with a

1        cartridge that had nicotine containing solution of

2        flavors in it and they looked like little versions of

3        a cigarette.  They were called the cigalikes or

4        cig-a-likes type products, And then there was the

5        rechargeable cigalikes, which came after, which is

6        very much similar to what VUSE is. VUSE is a

7        cigalike product. And now there are these open tank

8        -- what they call open tank systems where you send -~

9        many people have probably seen them at this point --

10        they have these big batteries and people are filling

11        -- using nicotine containing e-liquids that they have

12        got to fill up and they've got to clean their tank,

13        and a much higher powered battery is used in those

14        devices.  So, it's really changed quite a bit.  But

15        that is the current state of play in the market.

2015 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397                                          ,   CD

1        to be.  How does VUSE compare?

2   A.  Well, VUSE is quite different in that -- and, look,

3        there's not anything necessarily wrong with this, but

4        most of those devices are made in China and the

5        quality control can, at times, be suspect.  Then, of

6        course, there's some very fine products that come out

7        of China at the same time. But, for Reynolds, what

8        we felt was important was we felt it was very

9        important for us to have control over the cartridge

10        manufacture for VUSE and the e-liquid manufacturing,

11        and control over that production. So we automated a

12        means by which we could make those cartridges.

13           Now what -- the cartridges in China -- and we've

14        been over there a bunch -- are made by hand,

15        literally by groups of individuals, men and women,

16        sitting at long tables -assembling these cartridges by

17        hand, so we felt that that' was a quality control

18        issue.  Certainly, it's fine to have a hand crafted

19        chair, it's quite another thing to have a hand

20        crafted assembled part, and it's never � the quality

21        control is never as good as you can get when you can

22        automate and have machines do it.  So we automated

23        and invented automated equipment to make our

24        cartridges. We have a proprietary and unique system

25        by which the cartridge connects to a battery, so you

can only use a VUSE cartridge with a VUSE battery.

We implemented battery safety controls, over-charge protection, so that the battery, lithium-ion battery, so that it doesn't explode on charging, which I'm sure people have seen that happen with lithium-ion batteries.  In fact, I was watching the TV the other night. Those hoverboards that everybody wants for Christmas, they seem to be blowing up all the time. That's a lithium-ion battery malfunction. So if you don't have the proper battery control systems in place from the charging mechanism perspective, they can catch fire.  So, we've instituted those types of control.  So a whole variety of those type of quality controls we've put in place in the manufacture of VUSE as well as parts testing and stewardship of the product.  So -- I'm sorry.  I don't mean to ramble on and on about it. Where is VUSE assembled and manufactured?

	Q.
	And the current VUSE cartridge, can consumers go down

2
	
	to the Vape shop and try to refill that on their own

3
	
	or is that a system that is, if not tamper proof,

4
	
	very difficult to tamper with?

5
	A.
	It's difficult to -- It would be very difficult to

6
	
	tamper with and, as I said, the cartridge itself,

7
	
	once the time runs out on that cartridge, it shuts

8
	
	off, it can't be shut back on. So even if somebody

9
	
	wanted to, say, use a syringe and jam some liquid

10
	
	msiQc a vubJii carrriQge, ii it was an expiree

11
	
	cartridge, you could put the liquid in there but you

12
	
	couldn't use it, because the VUSE battery recognizes

13
	
	that cartridge is dead.  You've got two --you've got

14
	
	a battery chip and you've got a cartridge chip and

15
	
	they talk to one another and it helps control that

16
	
	system, so it's pretty clever in that sense.

17
	Q.
	Are you aware of any other e-cigarettes manufactured

18
	
	that has that kind of technology that VUSE has?

19
	A.
	Not that I'm aware of, no.

20
	Q.
	One other issue on how VUSE may be different from

21
	
	another -- you mentioned in response to Mr. Gale's

22
	
	question about people cranking the voltage up on some

23
	
	of these e-cigarettes. What safeguards did Reynolds

24

1        have a number of resisters and capacitors in our

2        power unit, which is our battery, which regulates

3        that voltage.  So there is the communication between

4        the chip in the battery and the chip in the cartridge

5        is important in regulating the amount of power that

6        goes across the wick and that is monitored� I can't

7        remember the number of hertz, it's every like

8        .5 milliseconds or something like that, so it's a

9        pretty high frequency or pulse to modulate that

10        power.  So there's a power modulation, a feature in

11        there.

12   Q.  What are one of the �-- some of the potential concerns

13        if people were to be able to increase the voltage on

14        the e-cigarettes? I realize they can't do it with

15        VUSE, but other e-cigarettes that they crank the

16        voltage up, what are some of the potential issues

17        with doing that?

18   A.  Well, you can � You know, look, when you start

19        getting � if you start applying more energy to the

20        system, you're likely.to create more heat and if you

21        start to break that heat threshold, you can start to

22        char and you can start to burn and you can start to

23        potentially combust the e-liquid itself.  So, you

24        know, there's not a lot of magic in the e-liquid.

25        There's glycerin and propylene glycol and flavors and

	nicotine. And when you burn glycerin, you're going

2
	to make potential toxicants,  I mean, there's

3
	glycerin is cigarettes, it's an organic compound.

4
	What happens when you start to burn things is you

5
	start to make toxicants and carcinogens potentially.

6
	So the idea in the power regulation is to make sure

7
	that you're regulating the power sufficient to make

8
	an aerosol, our you oon *c want tuEt wick to get very

9
	hot and that was you avoid degradation of the

10
	e-liquid to form potential toxicants. That doesn't

11
	say -- it doesn't mean it won't happen, but you want

12
	to minimize that potential as much as possible.

13  Q
	That safeguard and the other safeguard you talked

14
	about, including product stewardship and making sure

15
	you're using quality ingredients and stuff, are there

16
	any existing today current regulations that require

17
	Reynolds to adopt or pursue all of those safeguards?

18  A
	None at all.  In fact, the FDA has considered

19
	e-cigarettes to be a deemed product, but have yet to

20
	issue their guidance or their regulations yet.  So

21
	right now, it's in essence an unregulated product.

22   Q
	And despite the fact it was unregulated, Reynolds

23
	took all those additional steps voluntarily?

24  A
	We did. We believe that this was a potential

25
	significant benefit for potentially public health,

	Q.
	You were asked some questions by Mr. Gale about

�4
	
	whether you consider it safe or not,  You made

5
	
	reference to without long term epidemiological, you

6
	
	couldn't quantify the long-term risk.  Let me ask you

7
	
	this question: Based on the data that we do have,

8
	
	the chemistry data that you referred to earlier and

9
	
	Reynolds' safeguards that it has used and any other

10
	
	data of which you're aware, is there anything in your |

11
	
	opinion that would indicate that VUSE has the

12
	
	potential to be more harmful than the traditional    |

13
	
	tobacco products?

14
	A.
	Not that I've seen, no.  I've seen just the opposite.

15
	Q.
	Let's talk about what does the data -- What does the

16
	
	date suggest to you as the potential for VUSE to be

17
	
	less risky than traditional tobacco products?

18
	�x <
	I mean, I think it has a very high potential of doing

19
	
	that.  I mean, looking at the aerosol chemistry, very

20
	
	difficult to find anything in there, and it's hard

21
	
	to -- you know, when the levels get so low that you

22
	
	have to change all your methodology to try to get

23
	
	down even further to try to find stuff, you know

24
	
	you're -- I think you know you're heading in the

25
	
	right direction.  That's where we are with VUSE.  We

1.                 studied it using conventional cigarette methodologies

2        and we cannot find toxicants and carcinogens at

3        sufficient enough quantity to be above detection

4        limits.  That doesn't mean they're not necessarily

5        there, but they're at much lower levels. So we have

6        gone through, and continue to go through, significant

7        efforts to go and see smaller and smaller quantities

9                 with VUSE products, we have a difficult time seeing

10        anything.  If we get better and better methods, maybe

11        we will find the presence of toxicants and

12        carcinogens. That doesn't rule out that it still

13        wouldn't be lower risk than cigarettes, again, if it

14        does question to me. And it looks like a pretty

15        straightforward, pretty clean aerosol.

16   Q.  And you mentioned earlier Reynolds' migration

17        strategy.  Is VUSE electronic cigarette part of

18        Reynolds' migration strategy? y       /\.   ouxe, yes.

21  .�*..v^,.r:jand where #y.�utth.ink,,y.USE and the other products that

22        R'eynolds has fit into that strategy compared to

23        conventional tobacco burning cigarettes?

24   A.  Well, I mean, I think that conventional tobacco

25        burning cigarettes are the most risky.  I think the

2015 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397                                                    a>

Page 262

1          next with a little bit lower risk are probably

2          products like Eclipse. Although it's not

3          definitively proven, we do know that it produces

4          lower exposures of carcinogens and toxicants to

5          smokers who use them, so it's probably lower in risk.

6          Certainly, it's well known, at least well known to

7          the public health community, that all smokeless

8          tobacco products are significantly lower in risk than

9          smoking cigarettes, even though tobacco consumers

10          don't necessarily know that, but they are

11          significantly lower in risk.

12              So all of our smokeless products, including Snus

13          and moist snuff, would be lower on the risk

14          continuum.  Then, it's hard to say.' I think I would

15          argue to put -- until we know better -- VUSE is

16          either somewhere around the smokeless products -- it

17          could be a lot lower, unlikely to be higher -- but,

18          you are inhaling an aerosol, so I don't know if that

19          may not have longer term effects, but certainly I

20          would say it's going to be -- likely to be much lower

21          than burning cigarettes.  Then finally you would have

22          nicotine replacement therapies, I think as low on the

23          risk continuum next to quitting, and of course NRT's

24          would include things like Zonnic gum that we make and 2 5                      Nivonovum.

	Q.
	That's what I was going to ask you. Reynolds has

2
	
	products across the whole portfolio you mentioned,

3
	
	including nicotine replacement therapy and nicotine

4
	
	gum; is that true?

5
	A.
	Correct.  In the U.S., we have nicotine gum.  In

6
	
	Sweden, there is a number of nicotine replacement

7
	
	therapies that Nivonovum makes and sells. And we

8
	
	recently got approval for, I believe, a lozenge in

12
	Q.
	And you've talked about your views with respect to

13
	
	the potential differential risk and you've made

14
	
	reference to epidemiology and smokeless tobacco

15
	
	products. Under existing FDA regulations, current

	environment in Reynolds today, is Reynolds allowed to

17
	
	tell the public that, hey, you should switch to Snus,

18
	
	Eclipse, or an e-cigarette, or even switch to an NRT

19
	
	because it's safer than a tobacco product?

20
	A i
	Cannot do. Cannot do. Explicitly cannot do that.

21
	Q.
	So, despite the fact that Reynolds internally has

22
	
	beliefs in what the data shows, are they allowed to

23
	
	communicate those beliefs to smokers?

21
	
	a drug of habituation?

2
	A.
	The FDA gets their money solely from the tobacco

3
	
	industry for this purpose.

4
	Q.
	And would that include Reynolds and before the merger

10
	
	magnitude of the user fees that Reynolds has paid to

11
	
	the FDA over time?

12
	A.
	Well, give the indication this year, I think it's

13
	
	going to be about $180 million that Reynolds -- just

14
	
	Reynolds will pay to the FDA, and that goes on every
 1

15
	
	year, and I think the -- I think the overall number

16
	
	gets capped in another five years or so. But it's

17
	
	hundreds of millions of dollars will be required to

18
	
	run the regulatory agency for tobacco out to

19
	
	infinity.

20
	Q.
	And one of the things that FDA is doing with that

21
	
	money is funding research, looking to see if a non

22
	
	addictive level could be -- or is knowable?

	I believe that is correct, yes.

could it do that without FDA approval?

Can't do it.

Let's talk about Mr. Gale's hypothetical denicotinized cigarette that doesn't have any nicotine in it whatsoever.  If a smoker continued to

Not at all.

Why?

Well .-- and we know this because there have been

denicotinized cigarettes made � they still make

carcinogens. When you set them on fire, they are

going to maKe carcinogens and toxicants�  do, 11 you

smoked a cigarette that didn't contain nicotine and

continued to smoke that cigarette, you're still going

to expose yourself to the things that cause -- that

are likely to cause disease, so it's not safe in any

way.

Let's talk a little bit about the role of nicotine.

	There's a catch with nicotine in your throat, so it's

2
	known.  You have a sensory reaction to nicotine.

3
	It's a bit of a bitter taste that is expected when
 i

4
	you siuoKe cigaremes .                            \

5   Q
	And you had mentioned that at various points in time,

. 6
	efforts have been made to test market cigarettes with

7
	variable yields of nicotine, whether they were called

8
	denicotinized, but very, very low yields of nicotine.

9
	How did, if you know, doctor, how did consumers

10
	perceive or evaluate those cigarettes in terms of the

11
	taste and acceptability?

12  A
	They were not received well, There was.a Benson and

13
	Hedges de-nic and I think a Merit de-nic. There was,

14
	of course, the Quest cigarettes that came out with

15
	the genetically modified tobacco that had very, very  j

16
	low nicotine and, in theory, no nicotine, and well

17
	there was still a little bit of nicotine in there,

18
	but, no, not received well.

19   Q
	Was that due in part to the fact that nicotine was

20
	not present or was not in there significant enough to 1

21
	contribute to the sensory properties and taste       |

22
	properties?

23  A
	Well, part of it. Again, on the Philip Morris side

24
	and the stuff that they did, they used an extraction

25
	technique and when they do that, they're removing a

1        bunch of flavor compounds as well as the nicotine.

2        On the Quest side, the GMO tobaccos, if you change

3        the genetic make up of the tobacco, you're likely

4        going to shift all those ratios of amino acids and

5        alkaloids so you probably have a bit of a different

6        taste in those products as well.  So it's a hard nut

7        to crack, really.  It's a difficult proposition to

8        get right, and to my mind, it hasn't been gotten

9        right yet.

10   Q.  When these cigarettes, denicotinized or very, very

11        low nicotine yielding cigarettes, were poured on the

12        market, did the public health community jump onboard

13        and encourage smokers to switch to one that was going

14        to be better' for them?

15   A.  No, it was quite the opposite.  In fact, I think when

16        Philip Morris came out with their de-nic products in

17        the early, early 90's, Campaign For Tobacco-Free

18        Kids, Matt Myers -- or he may not have been with them

19        at that point -- but, Matt Myers came out and

20        basically proclaimed that would be one of the most

21        dangerous cigarettes on the whole market that's ever

22        been made.  So the public health community has a very

23        unusual way of changing its mind over time and how it

24        views thing.  And certainly, denicotinized cigarettes

25        are no different than a variety of the other things

2   Q.  And getting back to the FDA for a moment, does the

3        FDA have the authority to adopt a product standard

4        and set a level for nicotine in the cigarettes?

	Dr. Figler, let's turn to some of the documents that  |

4
	
	Mr. Gale showed you.  First is, I think, Exhibit 6, a \

5
	
	document authored by Claude Teague. Let me ask you a f

6
	
	few questions.  This stamp along the bottom, these TL \

	You indicated that this � on page one of this, it   \

	Not that I'm aware of, no.                       j

14
	Q.
	On the acknowledgement page, page 20, of Exhibit 6,   \

15
	
	it made reference to University of North Carolina

16
	
	executive program and Dr. Reader. By virtue of the   \

17
	
	work you've done in this litigation, do you have an   j

18
	
	understanding or information with respect to that     j

19
	
	program and Dr. Teague's involvement?              \

20

	Yes, he was involved in that and it was an executive \

21
	
	program, kind of like an executive MBA type program,  |

22
	
	business program, and it's my understanding he       j

23
	
	constructed a number of strategic memos in

	an RDR or an RDM?

2
	A.
	No, it is not indicated anywhere that that's what

3
	
	that would be.

4
	Q.
	I may be stretching your memory a bit, but do you

5
	
	remember what the format of RDR's and RDM's in terms

6
	
	of what it looked like on the first page and any

7
	
	designations that would indicate what they were?

8
	A.
	Yeah, you had a specific, almost like a formula on

9
	
	how you would lay it out. You would have,your RDR or

10
	
	RDM number, you had a project number, you had an

11
	
	author, you had a title of what the project was, so

12
	
	yeah, it was formulaic in terms of how these reports

13
	
	were issued to the library.

14
	Q.
	For RDM's and RDR's, was there an approval system and

15
	
	an area of the document that had an approval by the

16
	
	person's manager before it would be submitted to the

17
	
	library?

18
	A.
	There was, yes.

19
	Q.
	Do you see whether there is any approval line or any

20
	
	signature by Dr. league's supervisor or manager

21

22
	A.

1        about this clean chewing tobacco and asked if that's

2        Snus. Remind us how long has Snus as a tobacco

3        product been in existence?

4   A.  A couple of hundred years.

5   Q.  Who was the first U.S. tobacco company to bring Snus

6        to the U.S. market?

7   A.  Modern Snus, it would be either R.J. Reynolds or you

8        might say it was Swedish Match, but that's hard to

9        know,  I think Swedish Match was -- that was Swedish

10        Snus in the U.S. market.

11   Q.  Among the major cigarette manufacturers, Philip

12        Morris, Lorillard when they were separate at the

13        time, and others, who was the first cigarette

14        manufacturer to bring Snus to the U.S. market?

15   A.  Reynolds.

16   Q.  Why did Reynolds bring Snus to the U.S. market; what

17        was the reasoning?

18   A.  Because of the lower risk potential for Snus and it

19        was known that Swedish style Snus had accomplished

20        quite a bit in Sweden in terms of lung cancer rates

21        among men, lowest lung cancer rates in all of Europe,

22        largely attributable to the fact that most men in

23        Sweden had switched from using cigarettes to using

24        Snus.

25   Q.  Was Snus introduced -- developed and introduced by

18
	
	destroyed documents.  To be candid with you, doctor,

19
	
	that sounds sinister.  Did Reynolds have some

No,   he did not.

The gentleman's agreement, you were asked some questions about the gentleman's agreement and I believe you said, testified, that your awareness of that comes from being asked questions by plaintiff's lawyers in situations like this? Correct, yes.

Did Mr, Gale show you any documents that talked about something called a gentleman's agreement? I did not see any.

Remind us of what your understanding of what this alleged gentleman's agreement would be, or what it prohibited or what the companies agreed to? In theory, from my understanding, as its' been explained to me, is no biological research would occur on cigarettes or health related research around cigarettes. And, as I explained, if there was such an agreement, R.J. Reynolds broke it probably from day one, because they were doing biological research from the 60's to today.

And you provided Mr. Gale a reliance list. Do you know if that reliance list contains Reynolds' research on biological research going back to the 60?s and forward up to more recent times, including biological research with animals, biological research

12
	
	more widely available?

13
	A.
	It would.

14
	Q.
	The fact that it's in limited distribution, is that

15
	
	because Reynolds is trying to keep it or hide it from

16
	
	people?

17
	A.
	No, just it's in limited distribution because there's

18
	
	not that many customers that buy it and we do keep it

19
	
	available for those customers who want it. We're not

	It is.

	If sales were to pick up in Florida, would it be more

Doctor, the last topic I think I want to talk about

is questions related to the Tobacco Institute, Council for Tobacco Research, Frank Statement. Let's first set the ground rules. Were you identified today as a corporate representative for R.J. Reynolds, authorized to speak on behalf of the company regarding Tobacco Institute, Council for Tobacco Research or the Tobacco Institute Research Council?

Not for this deposition. You have done that in the past, correct? i nave, yes�

And I believe you told us --� you made reference to the Duval depositions, perhaps in 2010? Yes.

So that was about five years ago? Correct.

Has it been about"five- years sirree you laStr looked- at documents regarding Tobacco Institute and Council for Tobacco Research? That is correct.

So the testimony you were providing was not based on a recent review of those materials, but what you recall from several years ago; is that fair? MR. GALE:  Objection to form.

If it turns out to be not thousands, would that

surprise you?

It wouldn't.  It wouldn't surprise me.

To your recollection, did the Frank Statement ever

run more than one occasion in January of 1954?

That much, I do know.  It ran one time.

I know you reviewed the complaint and the

interrogatories. You are not intending� don't

intend to give case specific testimony in this case,

do you, with respect to Mr. Jones Demos?

No.

So you don't have any information as to whether Mr.

Jones or his wife saw the Frank Statement?

No idea, no,

Let me ask you � I think Mr. Gale asked you some

questions about the Frank Statement, including the

statement that there's no proof that cigarette

smoking is one of the causes of disease.  I'm going

to test your memory. Do you know if the lead in to

that was that distinguished authorities point out

that there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one

of the causes?

1   A.  It does.  It says distinguished authorities point out

2        and then they use a colon and then there's a number

3        of numbered bullet points underneath, of which number

4        three is that there is no proof that cigarette

5        smoking is one of the causes.

6   Q.  Again, doctor, if I'm stretching your memory, tell

7        me, but if you recall this information, please do so.

8        Do you know in this time, January of '54, if there

9        were distinguished authorities outside of the tobacco

10        companies who were pointing out that it hadn't been

11        proven that cigarette smoking was one of the causes?

12   A.  Oh, yeah.  I mean, the NCI did not agree. The NCI

13        didn't believe that it was one of the causes at that

14        time. There was a number of distinguished

15        authorities that questioned whether or not the

16        statics were enough to establish that and many

17        outright said it wasn't possible.

18   Q.  Number one under this distinguished authorities point

19        out -- we were reading number three, but number one

20        says that medical research of recent years indicates

21        many possible causes of lung cancer. Was that an

22        accurate statement at the time, in January of '54?

23   A.  Oh, it was at the time and it is today as well.

24   Q.  Number two, there is no agreement among the

25        authorities regarding what the cause is; was that an

 1

	had kept public health as a concern and I just want

8
	
	to follow you on some of that stuff.  We talked a lot 1

9
	
	about modifications that had been done to cigarettes,

10
	
	general reduction, filters, reconstituted tobacco,    j

12
	
	of those kinds of things? How does that relate to    j

13
	
	the maintaining the interest of public health?

14
	A.
	I think it's a direct correlation.

15
	Q.
	I think you told us that the epidemiology again      �

17
	
	cigarettes carry less risk than non filtered.  So if  j

 Reynolds didn't have concern about public health and

19
	
	cigarettes were just like they were, non filtered, in

20
	
	the 50's, would we have seen this reduction in risk

21
	
	for consumers if they never existed?

22
	A.
	Obviously not.                                 j

1        interest in public health?

2   A.  I think, to me, it fits in consistently with what

3        their -- Reynolds' operating premise was. And the

4        operating premise, simply put, was if there

5        are -- the operating premise was even if you can't

6        fully establish that smoking is a direct cause, that

7        you can't make a causal connection, if there are

8        things in smoke that are of concern, it would be best

9        to minimize them. Certainly, that operating premise

10        was executed by Reynolds scientists and by their

11        product development efforts over the next 60 years.

12   Q.  We'll come back to that in a second, but with respect

13        to Reynolds' participation in the NCI Tobacco Working

14        Group, was that voluntary? Did Reynolds have to

15        participate in that program?

16   A.  No, they were asked if they would like to participate

17        and they agreed � Reynolds agreed.

18   Q.  Then with respect to implementing the operating

19        premise, let me ask you this question:  Did Reynolds'

20        position on whether smoking was proven to be a

21        causative disease get in the way whatsoever with the

22        research that it conducted trying to address the

23        criticisms that were being levered against the

24        product?

25   A.  No, that research continued.

12
	Q.
	When did the research conducted that led to the

13
	
	development of Premier?                          j

14
	A,
	It began in the 1980's, so I think around !83, '84    \

15
	
	timeframe perhaps, so several years of research --   j

16
	
	many years of research occurred before the product    1

	was ready.                                   ' � f

	Q.
	And the research on Premier and commercial

	implementation, that was at a time where Reynolds

20
	
	still had the position that it hadn't been

21
	
	scientifically established that smoking causes

22

	work was going on while the company didn't believe it

2
	
	had been established?

3
	A.
	Well, again, I would say at that time in the 80's, it

4
	
	certainly looked like it was -- that cigarette

5
	
	smoking would be a risk factor in the development of :

6
	
	disease. Again, still not a cause and effect --

7
	
	enough for a cause and effect in Reynolds' mind, but

8
	
	that, again, didn't interrupt the idea that if you

9
	
	can find a way to make a pleasurable tobacco smoke

10
	
	aerosol that's got lower constituents, then that's

11
	
	what they were trying to do. And at that time, it

12
	
	was realized that if you brought tobacco up to a

13
	
	temperature that didn't exceed say five or 600

14
	
	degrees Celsius, that you could minimize the number

15
	
	of toxicants that were formed. That's what

16
	
	heat-not-burn is about.  Heat the tobacco rather than

17
	
	burn it.

18
	Q.
	How much did Reynolds invest in the 1980s in research

19
	
	and development and test market of Premier?

20
	A �
	Oh, just Premier, it was hundreds of millions of

21
	
	dollars was spent just on Premier.  Premier and

22
	
	Eclipse together, over the last 20-odd years, over a

23
	
	billion dollars has been spend on heat-not-burn

24
	
	technologies.

25

	Did Reynolds have to hire scientists for Premier?

Hundreds. The Bowman Gray Technical Facility was

Did it have to build new laboratory space to work on

Premier^

Absolutely.

And what � And I'll be brief here/doctor. What

were the design objectives of Premier?

The design objectives of Premier was to simplify the

smoke industry, provide a less biologically active

cigarette smoke, and minimize environmental tobacco

smoke in a design.

Did Reynolds achieve that with Premier?

They did, yeah. Technically, they did achieve that.

Did Reynolds publish the results of research that it

conducted on Premier into prototypes?

Yes, they did, put out a large monograph.

Did Reynolds' scientists make presentations at

conferences regarding Premier's technology?

They most certainly did.

Did Reynolds scientists meet with the FDA, the FTC

and other government agencies with respect to

Premier?

We did, yes.

In those meetings and presentations, did Reynolds

the federal government as well as other scientists at

scientific conferences?

They did.

The Premier technology, did Reynolds receive any

patents arising out of Premier?

Over 40.

As the vice president of cigarette product

development, do you have an opinion as to whether it

would have been possible to manufacture Premier prior

to the time Reynolds did?

No, it would not have been. In fact, part of the

technology was fairly new that was implemented.

As part of Premier research and development, were new

manufacturing capabilities -- did they have to be

invented?

They did.

Were new materials developed and incorporated in

cigarettes that hadn't been there before?

Yes,

I know we talked about Eclipse and Premier.  Remind

us, how did premier do in the test market?

Terrible.

After Premier did not fair very well with consumers,

did Reynolds give up on the heat-not-burn technology?

4
	dose question, if they yielded more, itrs likely that |

5
	a smoker would be exposed to more.  So, potentially,

6
	they would have been a higher yielding product.      1

10
	MR. KREINER: Objection to form.

11
	THE WITNESS: Well, I don't think I can

12
	definitively say that, but I think the    j

13
	indication would be that those yields     j

14
	of today's filtered cigarettes would be    j

15
	lower than the yields of the filtered     j

16

4
	Q.  Have there been times that R.J. Reynolds has not

5
	cooperated with the public health community?

6
	A.  I don't know about cooperated.  I think we had

.7
	differences of opinions. Certainly, we have funded   l

8
	an awful lot of public health community research,

9
	certainly we participated in.NCI-TWG, so I -- Having

10
	a scientific disagreement is not a demonstration of

11
	being uncooperative in my opinion.

12
	Q.  But, if the public health community asked R.J,

	Reynolds for its research and reports on smoking

	MR. KREINER; Objection to form.          \

17
	THE WITNESS:  I don't 'know.  We

19
	to the surgeon general in '64, who then

20
	conclude that cigarette smoking was a

21
	cause of lung cancer in men, so I don't    j

22
	see how that would be considered

	Since the FDA regulations, R.J. Reynolds has had to

	The unbound nicotine is a function of Ph, so any base

2
	
	could raise the Ph.. But, the fact of the matter is

3
	
	it's smoke Ph and the smoke Ph of our products is

4
	
	somewhere between five and a half and 6.8, which is

5
	
	acidic, so there is not appreciable amounts of free

6
	
	nicotine in smoke -- cigarette smoke, as the surgeon

7
	
	general in '81 pointed out.

8
	Q.
	But, there is unbound or free nicotine in cigarette

9
	
	smoke, correct?

10
	A.
	Less than two percent.

11
	Q.
	And only -- I think you testified earlier today that

12
	
	only a small amount of nicotine even makes it into an

13
	
	individual's system, correct?

14
	A.
	In comparison to the overall available in a

15
	
	cigarette, yeah.  I mean, if you want free, unbound

16
	
	nicotine in a tobacco product, then you would look at

17
	
	cigars where the Ph of the smoke is well up over

18
	
	seven, and that's where most of the nicotine is

19
	
	actually in free base form.

20
	Q.
	One thing that counsel here brought up that I did not

21
	
	bring up today was the warning label on cigarettes,

22
	
	so every pack of cigarettes you smoked had a warning

21
	A.
	Uh-huh,

22
	Q.
	Does eating a good meal affect the nicotine receptors

23
	
	in your brain?

	what they were first identified as.  It doesn't mean

2
	
	that that's -- that the only thing that they pick up

3
	
	or have affinity for is nicotine.

4
	Q.
	So, have you ever seen a study that says eating a

5
	
	good meal affects the receptors in a person's brain?

6
	A.
	I have heard that reported.  It certainly releases

7
	
	the pleasure centers-in your brain, which is where

8
	
	those receptors are located,

9
	Q.
	Right. And there are different types of receptors

10
	
	that release dopamine in your brain, correct?

11
	A.
	inereare, yes.

12
	Q.
	Do you know how many different types of receptors in

13
	
	your brain release dopamine?

14
	A.
	I'm sure there's more than one. My only point was

15
	
	that they're called nicotinic receptors because

16
	
	that's what was first identified, in terms of an

17
	
	affinity.  But, I can't imagine that the human animal

18
	
	has evolved simply to have nicotine receptors in

19
	
	their brain, specific for only nicotine.

20
	Q.
	You talked a lot about how much money R.J. Reynolds

21
	
	spent on research and development of Premier and

22

23

	You talked a^little bit about the denicotinized

	cigarettes so a couple of follow ups on that. Okay?

4
	
	Do you know of any person who has smoked a

	denicotinized cigarette, a pack a day for 40 years?

6
	A.
	No,

7
	Q.
	Okay.  Do you know any person that has died from

8
	
	smoking a denicotinized cigarette?

9
	A.
	That,. I don't know.  I mean.  The first question you

10
	
	asked me was not knowable because no denicotinized

11
	
	� cigarette has been on the market for that long, so I

12
	
	don't know how that's --

13
	Q.
	So maybe that's an unfair question.

14
	A.
	Well, I don't know that it's unfair.  It's just not

15
	
	possible.

16
	Q.
	Okay. But, to your knowledge, no American has ever

17
	
	died from smoking a denicotinized cigarette, correct?

18
	A
	Again, I don't know if they've been on the market

19
	
	long enough to propagate a disease.  I mean, they've

20
	
	only been.on the -- I mean, the Quest cigarettes were

21
	
	only on the market for a couple of years, so it takes

22
	
	much longer to produce a health effect. What I can

23
	
	tell you definitively is I've looked at the chemistry

24
	
	of that smoke and it is not dissimilar, with the

25
	
	exception of nicotine, not dissimilar to cigarettes

6   RECROSS-EXAMINATION BY MR. KREINER

7   Q.  Dr. Figler, just a couple of follow ups on what you

8        were just asked about, then we'll get you out of

9        here. You were asked about advertising for lights,

10        low tar type cigarettes. Have you ever been shown an

11        ad or seen an ad that you recall in which one of the

12        cigarette manufacturers advertised that, in fact,

13        lights or low tar cigarettes were safer?

14   A.  Not that I know of, no.

15   Q.  At the time that those cigarettes were being put in

16        the market in the 70's and 80's,.going -forward, what

17        was the public health community saying about whether

18        those cigarettes carried less risk?

19   A.  The public health community was saying that they did zu      carry less rxsK a no. mat tnose people wno continued

21        to smoke should smoke lower tar cigarettes, including

22        the surgeon general.

23   Q.  Switching topics, you were asked about the FDA

24        ordering Reynolds to take four cigarette brands off

25        the market.  When did that occur?

2015 3RD AVENUE NORTH - BIRMINGHAM, AL 35203 - 205-397-2397                                                    oo

1   A.  Just this summer.

2   Q.  What -- As concisely as you can, doctor, what was the

3        basis of the FDA ordering that Reynolds remove those

4        four brands from the market, specifically in relation

5        to whether they made, any assessments about the

6        dangers or addictiveness of those products and the

7        reason to take them off?

8   A.  They didn't make any assessment about the dangers or

9        addictiveness of the product.  They made an

10        assessment about whether the product that we were

11        comparing it to was substantially equivalent. And

12        the products we chose to compare those products to,

13        to grandfathered products, were -- the FDA deemed

14        that they were not substantially equivalent. So,

15        let's really go back to the drawing board and figure

16        out what your predicates ought to be and make better

17        arguments and better -- present better information to

18        the FDA so they can see it the same or similar way as

19        we do. We thought the products were substantial

20        equivalent.

21   Q.  Switching topics, you were asked about the warning

22        label and the fact that you continued to smoke

23        despite the existence of the warning label.  Did the

24        information on the warning level, as it changed over

25        time, did that tell you something you didn't already

know about the dangers of cigarette smoking?

No.

Did the fact that you continued to smoke despite the

warning label, did that mean that you weren't aware

that smoking carried significant risk?

No, I knew, and I certainly had family members that

had that affect on them.

The fact that you continued to smoke despite there

being a warning label, did that mean that the warning

label didn't contain useful information?

No.

Who decides what language goes on those warning

labels that are on the cigarette packs we see

advertised?

The FTC or government decides that.

Switching, you were asked some questions about

graphic warnings and Reynolds' efforts with respect

to graphic warnings.  I'm going to try to be brief

here.  To orient us in the same -- so we're all in

the same place, do you recall that the FTA proposed

additional graphic warnings be placed on,cigarettes;

do you recall that?

I do.

As part of the FDA's research into those graphic

warnings, did they look at whether those warnings, in

2
	A.
	They did. They did look at that.

3
	Q.
	What did the FDA conclude with respect, based on its

4
	
	research, as to whether those warnings would be

5
	
	effective?

6
	A.
	Well, the effectiveness that the FDA measured for

7
	
	those warnings was exactly zero difference in

8
	
	effectiveness for a non graphic warning. And, in

9
	
	fact, for some of the modules that they tested,.

10
	
	amongst teenagers especially, certain graphic

11
	
	warnings had the opposite effect, in that they would

12
	
	be actually attractive and do the opposite effect.

13
	
	So the final warnings that were proposed, they were

14
	
	not any different statistically from baseline to

15
	
	zero, so there was no significance in terms of the

16
	
	effectiveness so they had to go back to the drawing

17
	
	board.

18
	Q.
	You mentioned that Reynolds had instigated a legal

19

	Has Reynolds looked at the smoke chemistry to see if  j

11
	
	it could find measurable levels of formaldehyde?     j

12
	A.
	We have.                                      j

13
	Q.
	You mentioned something about below the detention

14
	
	limit.  If formaldehyde was present in VUSE above the

15
	
	limit of detection of the method, would Reynolds be

16
	
	able to see it?                               1

17
	A.
	Yes, we would.

18
	Q.
	So the fact that Reynolds has looked and can't find

19
	
	it, does that mean -- as a scientist, does that mean  [

	it is not there?                               j

	That does not mean it's not there.

	Has the FDA conclude that?

	I don't know that they've definitively concluded

18

	All right.  But, you just testified that the graphic

19
	
	warnings on cigarettes, which are much, much stronger

20
	
	than the warnings that are on cigarettes now, would

	Q.
	And even may show an increase in youth initiation?

2
	A.
	For one of the warnings, yeah, they did show that.

3
	Q.
	So does the FDA disbelieve that the warnings on packs

� 4
	
	of cigarettes don't warn anybody of any of that?

5
	A,
	No,  What it means is that the graphic warnings

6.
	
	didn't provide any additional benefit than the

7
	
	warnings that are currently on there now. And then,

8
	
	like I said in the one case, for a couple of the

9
	
	picture graphics that they had, there was a -- it was

10
	
	the opposite effect. But, they weren't able to

11
	
	definitively show that it provided a benefit. So

12
	
	does it make sense to have a government imposed

13
	
	regulation that's purported to do a public health

14
	
	good and their own data show that it doesn't do

15
	
	anything -- have that imposed on a company?  I mean,

16
	
	I think Reynolds was in the right in that case, to

17
	
	get a judge to look at it, and the judge concluded

18
	
	that we were correct,  That doesn't mean graphic

19
	
	warnings can't be effective or that the FDA won't

20
	
	come oacK witn Qiirerent warnings mat mignt oe

21
	
	effective.  But, the ones, that they brought up were

22
	
	not.

23
	Q.

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE NINETEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT

IN AND FOR INDIAN RIVER COUNTY, FLORIDA

CIVIL DIVISION

IN RE: ENGLE PROGENY CASES' TOBACCO LITIGATION

Case No: 2008 010057 CA 04 Pertains to: Phyllis Jones, as the Personal Representative of the Estate of Demos Jones

__________________________________I

SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR TRIAL BY TURV

Plaintiff sues Defendants and allege the following:

INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

1. This is a complaint against Defendants seeking compensatory and punitive damages in accordance with the Florida Supreme Court's class action decision and mandate in Engle v, Liggett Group, Inc., 945 So.2d 1246 (Fla, 2006). In approving the Engle Phase I class certification and trial, but ordering prospective class decertification, the Florida Supreme Court provided those who qualify for class member status this opportunity to complete unresolved individual damages claims. The Court held: "it was proper to allow the jury to make findings in Phase I on Questions 1 (general causation), 2 (addiction of cigarettes), 3 (strict liability), 4(a) (fraud by concealment), 5(a) (civil^onsphacy-concealment), 6 (breach of implied warranty), 7 (breach of express warranty), and 8 (negligence). Therefore, these findings in favor of the Engle class can stand." The Court further held that specified liability and general causation findings by the Engle jury did not need to be proved again as they shall be given res judicata effect. Consequently, Plaintiff brings this action upon the limited remaining issues in dispute: specific causation, compensatory and punitive damages, comparative fault and apportionment of damages.

2.          In Engle, the Florida Supreme Court approved certification for liability purposes of a class including all Florida citizens and residents and their survivors, who have suffered, presently suffer, or who have died from diseases and medical conditions caused by their addiction to cigarettes that contain nicotine. At all material times, Plaintiffs Decedent was a Florida citizen or resident who suffered and died from diseases and/or medical conditions caused by Decedent's addiction to cigarettes that contained nicotine. Plaintiffs Decedent developed and suffered from one or more of the diseases (which were found by the Engle Phase I jury to be caused by cigarette smoking and which are enumerated below and are contained in the Horida Supreme Court's Engle decision). Plaintiffs Decedent purchased and used cigarettes manufactured by each of the Defendants, including their predecessors and successors. Therefore, Plaintiffs Decedent has Engle class member status.

3.          The Florida Supreme Court expressly reserved to class members, including Plaintiffs and their Decedents, the right to bring individual actions against Defendants for smoking-related injuries and damages, including punitive damages. This action is timely because it is brought within one (1) year of the Florida Supreme Court's mandate in Engle,

4.          Plaintiff is seeking damages in excess of this Court's jurisdictional minimum or in excess of $15,000.

5.          Venue is proper in Indian River County because the cause of action accrued in Indian River County and/or one or more Defendants is a foreign corporation that has an agent or other representative in Indian River County.

6.          Demos Jones' died on September 21, 1995. Phyllis Jones is the Personal

Representative of the Estate of Demos Jones. Letters of Administration have been previously

filed with this court. This action is brought on behalf of the Decedent's Estate. The potential

7.          Defendant Philip Morris - USA, Inc. ("Philip Morris") is a Virginia corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Indian River County, and did so during all times relevant to this action.

8.          Defendant R.J. Reynolds, individually and as successor by merger to Lorillard Tobacco Company and Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, individually and as successor by merger to, The American Tobacco Company, is a North Carolina corporation that conducts business in the State of Florida, including Indian River County, and did so during all times relevant to this action.

9.          The Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A., Inc. ("Council") and the Tobacco Institute, Inc. ("Institute"), at all times relevant to this action, were involved in promotion, lobbying, medical research, legislative, and political activities or related ventures throughout Florida and the United States both in connection with and on behalf of Defendants.

10.        At all material times, Plaintiffs Decedent purchased, smoked, and was addicted to cigarette products containing nicotine which were the subject of Engle. The cigarette products containing nicotine were designed, manufactured, distributed, advertised, and marketed by Defendants.

11.        Plaintiff asserts the jury findings from the Phase I Engle trial which were given res judicata effect by the Florida Supreme Court, including but not limited to the following:

3
pgNbr=447
a.          Smoking cigarettes causes aortic aneurysm, bladder cancer, cerebral vascular disease, cervical cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary heart disease (including cardiovascular disease, hardening of the arteries, atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease and arteriosclerosis, angina, abnormal blood clotting, blood vessel damage, myocardial infarction (heart attack)), esophageal cancer, kidney cancer, laryngeal cancer, lung cancer (specifically, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma), complications of pregnancy, oral cavity/tongue cancer, pancreatic cancer, peripheral vascular disease, pharyngeal cancer, and stomach cancer.

b.          Nicotine in cigarettes is addictive.

c.          All Defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous.

d.          All Defendants concealed or omitted material information not otherwise known or available, knowing that the material was false or misleading, or failed to disclose a material fact concerning the health effects or addictive nature of smoking cigarettes or both.

e.          All Defendants agreed to conceal or omit information regarding the health effects of cigarettes or their addictive nature with the intention that smokers and the public would rely on this information to their detriment.

f.          All Defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective.

g.          All Defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that, at the time of sale or supply, did not conform to representations of fact made by Defendants.

h.       All Defendants were negligent.

12.     As a direct and proximate result of Decedent's addiction to smoking Defendants'

cigarettes, Decedent suffered bodily injury and died. Defendants' cigarettes caused Decedent to

develop one or more of the above-referenced cigarette-related diseases or medical conditions that

resulted in or substantially contributed to Decedent's death. Plaintiff claims all damages allowed

by the Florida Wrongful Death Act including the following: as a direct and proximate result of

Plaintiffs Decedent's death, Decedent's survivor(s) has/have and will suffer mental and

emotional pain and suffering, has/have incurred medical and financial expenses, loss of

Decedent's love, affection, support, services, protection, companionship, instruction, guidance,

4
pgNbr=448
and funeral expenses. Decedent's Estate has also suffered a loss of net accumulations, earnings, and medical and funeral expenses.

13.        Plaintiffs Decedent may bear some measure of fault, but less than 100% of the applicable fault, for causing his smoking-related injuries and death. Plaintiffs Decedent's acts or omissions relating to the frequency and duration of his efforts to quit smoking were a partial proximate cause, in combination with the acts and omissions of Defendants, of his injuries. Plaintiff therefore seeks apportionment of fault and damages between Decedent's Estate, and each Defendant who is responsible for damages on all Counts other than those alleging intentional torts.

14.        The Introduction and General Allegations above are re-alleged and incorporated herein by reference.

15.        With respect to smoking and health and the manufacture, marketing and sale of Defendants' cigarettes, the Engle Phase I findings conclusively establish that the cigarettes sold and placed on the market by Defendants were defective and unreasonably dangerous.

16.        As a direct and proximate result of Defendants* defective and unreasonably dangerous cigarettes, Plaintiff s Decedent suffered injuries and died.

17.        As a direct and proximate result of the Defendants' defective and unreasonably dangerous cigarettes, Decedent's Survivors has/have in the past sustained and will in the future sustain damages resulting from the injuries to the Decedent, including mental and emotional pain and suffering, medical and financial expenses, loss of Decedent's love, affection, support, services, protection, companionship, instruction, guidance, loss of net accumulations, earnings and funeral expenses.

A, OBJECT

The object of this discussion Is to analyze the effects of the smoking-health controversy on consumer behavior, to evaluate the short* and long-term implications of the tobacco Industry's "safer"*c1garette strategy, and to propose a new, consumer-oriented strategy for resolution of the smoking-health problem,                                                                                                                                          �

8. SUMMARY

A basic, simplistic equation relating the propensity of an Individual to smoke (P), to a nicotine habituation factor (H), a gratification factor (G), a cost factor (C), and a government regulatory factor (R), 1s:

P  *   (H 4  G)   -   (C ?  R)

Using this equation, the effects of the smoking-health controversy on consumer behavior are analyzed.

Using the same approach, the effects of the present "safer" cigarette strategy on consumer behavior are analyzed. Based on this analysis, the "safer8 cigarette strategy 1s prudent and valid for the short term, but may possibly lead to unsatisfying long-term results for both the consumer and the tobacco Industry. The "safer8 cigarette strategy 1$ based on the assumption that a product will eventually be found which satisfies the consumer on the one band, and on the other 1s permanently acceptable to the consumer and anti-tobacco forces in terms of health hazard. This desired equilibrium 1s not likely to be reached 1f the above equation is true and 1f history Is to be believed. Thus an alternate strategy becomes desirable,

A new business strategy Is proposed, In simplistic terms, the proposedi

new strategy should be to define the satisfactions' expected, or flerw .......frbm"]

cigarette smoking and to devise and market profitable new prbb'ucts - away~ j from conventional cigarettes - which will provide those same satisfactions : 'with no significant hazard to the health or the user, For the purposes of-?*

this discussion, nicotine Is considered to be a sine qua non 1n smoking .' satisfaction, and Ingestion of minimal amounts 1$ not considered to be hazardous to health.

C.   THE PRODIEH:   THE SHOKINS-HEALTH CONTROVERSY AND ITS IMPACT

(m ttumk mm m the mm vmim----------

Before proposing new solutions to the problem besetting the tobacco Industry as a result of the smoking-health controversy, H will be useful to define the bask problem as precisely as possible.   It will also be useful to consider the present strategy of the tobacco Industry for coping with the problem, end the short- and long-term Implications of that strategy.

In the smoklng-health controversy the visible, bruising conflict occurs between the tobacco Industry and the anti-tobacco forces.   In the heat of doing battle with our adversaries, we sometimes may forget that the present or potential smoker - sitting rather passively on the sidelines, judging the contest, and altering his smoking behavior accordingly - 1s the object of the game.

If consumer behavior 1s really the name of the game, any analysis of the smoklng-health problem end any strategy for Its solution by the tobacco Industry must be primarily consumer-oriented, rather then oriented toward our antagonists.  Accordingly, the present discussion 1s largely from that point of view and begins with a simplistic analysis of factors Influencing the propensity of Individuals to smoke.

'    I.   A Generalked. Simplistic Equation for Describing Consumer Behavior end the Market for Cigarettes

The simplistic equations presented below have been developed, primarily as tools for use 1n the remainder of this discussion,, to describe and relate various positive and negative factors In smoking to consumer behavior and markets for cigarettes.

The following general equation relates propensity to smoke cigarettes to the positive and negative factors Involved 1n smoking: -

?

P  �   (H  ?  6)   -   (C  +  R)

where:

P 1s the propensity (Inclination, freedom, desire) of a given Individual to smoke cigarettes,

H Is the physiological habituation factor, assumed to be nicotine,   3

0 1$ all other gratifications � physical, emotional, social, ego,   J etc., - positive or negative, expected or derived from smoking

cigarettes                                                                                                                              3

C Is the cost of cigarettes, and

R Is (government regulation of the marketing of cigarettes.

This equation Indicates that each Individual 1n a given population will have his own propensity to smoke, P.  He will smoke that type of cigarette which most closely matches Ms P value, I.e., at high values conventional cigarettes, at low values "hi-fi" cigarettes, and at zero or lower values he will not smoke.

An Individual's propensity (P) to smoke Is seen to be determined by a variety of factors, positive and negative.  The positive factors which have traditionally led to high values of P have been the physiological habituation (nicotine) factor, Hj and G, all other gratifications � physical, emotional, social, etc. - expected or derived from smoking relatively high nicotine, high flavor cigarettes.   The habituation factor, H, is believed to be relatively constant end large for confirmed smokers.  The gratification factor, G, in the past was strongly positive but now may vary widely in value depending upon the needs of the smoker, his habit patterns, his like or dislike for a given flavor or level of flavor, health anxiety associated with smoking, social attitudes toward smoking, and the like.  The smoking-health controversy results in a net decrease In the value of the gratification factor, G, for many smokers, and in the extreme case this factor may assume aero or even negative values.

The normally negative factors In the equation are cost of cigarettes, C, and government regulations on marketing of cigarettes, R.  All other things being equal, as they seldom are, any Increase 1n the cost of cigarettes would decrease the Individual's propensity, P, to'smoke, and might eliminate any propensity to smoke any cigarette*   Government regulations on marketing of a given type of cigarette, or all types of cigarettes, might be severe enough to eliminate the possibility of a smoker obtaining any or all types of cigarettes.  The smoking-health controversy has led, directly or Indirectly, to Increase 1n cost of cigarettes and Increasing government regulation of sale of cigarettes, thus reducing all P values to some degree.

'For the potential smoker, here defined as a person, usually young, who has never been a confirmed smoker, no habituation factor exists, � H�0� and the basic equation becomes:

p � G - (C + R)

That Is to say, the propensity of a pre-smoker to begin to smoke   -

cigarettes 1$ largely determined, on the positive side, by the                       o

gratifications he expects to receive.  These are largely social and              %

emotional gratifications which may be completely offset by health                 +

,. anxieties and changes in the social acceptability of smoking,                         j

With the habituation factor, H, eliminated from the equation we see that the propensity for a pre-smoker to smoke cigarettes may be quite different from that of a habituated smoker and that, with currently reduced gratification factors, the propensity of pre-smokers to begin to smoke et all Is substantially reduced from past years.

��� �#ifi of JmokersJ>referr1n� Each Given Jyj>ej>7 Curette � Share of^Market

If the basic equation

P �" (H 4C) - (C ? R)

1s valid, then for each smoker or pre-smoker there should be a given cigarette type which most closely matches his P value. That Is, that individual would choose to smoke, or to startto smoke, a given type of cigarette, Then, In a given population, the number of smokers or pre-smokers choosing to smoke a given type of cigarette would be the sum of the Individuals 1n the population with P values matching that type of cigarette. The high P group would choose conventional cigarettes, the low P group would choose high filtration cigarettes, and of course those with zero values of P would not smoke at all.

It follows then, that the number of smokers 1n a given population -relating to size of total market - 1s a function of the sum of the positive P values found in that population.

.

One could go on and on with more precise and more specific equations describing the propensity of individuals to smoke, the size of markets, and the like. Indeed, at another time It may be Interesting and profitable, 1n terms of market research, to do so.

For the purposes of this discussion, however, the point to be emphasized 1s that en Individual's propensity to smoke or start to smoke (P) cigarettes 1s determined by a habituation factor (H) and personal end environmental factors (6, C, and R), as expressed by the basic equation:

P � (H 4 C) * (C 4 R)

As these factors, real or perceived, change as a result of the smoklng-

health controversy, the Individual's propensity to smoke will change,

as will his preference for a given type of cigarettes, his rate of

consumption, and the size of the aggregate market.                                        v

This basic* simplistic-equation describing consumer behavior will form the basis fpr much of which 1s lo follow dealing with resolution of the smoklng-bealth controversy.

H.  The Anti-Tobacco Allegations:  Effects on Consumer Behavior

The allegations and activities of the anti-tobacco forces In the smoking-health controversy are well known.   The controversy Intensifies and escalates, and will doubtless continue for many years.  Whether or not the anti-tobacco allegations are true* orowinq numbers of oeonleTolleve them to be at least partially true and are altering their attitudes and actions accordingly;

Pre-smokers are made Increasingly apprehensive about the health consequences of smoking, and confirmed smokers are being Influenced to switch to "safer cigarettes* cut down on smoking, or cease altogether.  The social desirability of smoking Is decreased as the antl- or non-smoking groups grow in numbers, and many of the positive social, emotional and*ego,gratifications once derived from smoking.are sharply attenuated by changes brought about in the attltudlnal environment or by health-anxiety on the part of the smoker.  These and many related forces tend to reduce the gratifications (6) expected or derived from smoking.

At the same time, cigarette taxes, largely punitive, are driving the cost (C) of cigarettes upward.   The government 1s moving Increasingly toward restrictions on composition, advertising and sale on cigarettes (R).

Returning to our bask equation described earlier, Indicating by arrows the direction of changes occurring In smoking factors,

P  *   (H + G)  -   (C ?  R) ?                      +

and generalizing, we see that the allegations and activities of the anti-tobacco forces are reducing the propensity of the individual to smoke by reducing the over-all gratifications derived, by Increasing the cost of cigarettes, and by increasing the amount of government regulation on the marketing of cigarettes. Changing values of P cause switches In cigarette types favored by consumers and cause some smokers and pre-smokers to become or remain non-smokers.   Reduced aggregate values of P appear to indicate reduction 1n the total amount of cigarettes consumed.  Thus, the anti-tobacco allegations are having an effect on consumer behavior which is clearly adverse to the Interests of the tobacco industry.

In response to the health allegations of the anti-tobacco forces,               S

the tobacco Industry has been largely forced to search for and market                 M

a never-ending stream of "safer" cigarettes.   The theory here* one ;                  �

supposes. 1s that at some point In time the tobacco industry will reach an equilibrium position where its cigarettes barely^satlsfy the smoker

on the one hand and barely appease the anti-tobacco forces on the other. That this is a prudent and valid business strategy for the short teS" Is without question - no other strategy 1s possible.   However, as will be seen below, this strategy has serious long term Implications which are somewhat disturbing.

In its search for "safer" cigarettes, the tobacco Industry has, In essentially every case, simply reduced the amount of nicotine (H) and amount and/or quality of smoke delivered to the smoker, thereby perhaps weaning the smoker away from nicotine habituation and depriving him of parts of the gratification desired or expected.

The expense of discovering, manufacturing and marketing of multiple, "safer" brands Is reflected in higher cigarette prices (C).

*,                                                                                                      t�        ,

Returning again to our basic equation, Indicating by arrows the direction of changes occurring In smoking factors,

I � (y + j) - (c + r)

and generalizing, we see that the quest for a "safer" cigarette is reducing the propensity of individuals to smoke by reducing much of the gratification obtained and by increasing the cost of cigarettes. Hopefully, by now the reader 1s sufficiently familiar with the equation used to see the further Implications of these changes' in terms of brand switching, share of market shifts among cigarette types, and changes in the size of the aggregate market.

c._ Long-Term JmpJ katlonsjof J^Siifer^ Ci^ajrjeJtte Strategy^

Combining the effects of the anti-tobacco allegations t with the effects of the "safer" cigarette strategy), as outlined above, produces an equation which looks like this:

Ih*Lf$ iS $!y* WlW $ |!ft.Wfetiltfffl.....allegations are re-enforced

by the effects of the "safer" cigarette strategy, leading to a marked decrease inthe average propensity, P, of the present or potential smoker to smoke.                                                                               '

The theory that a "safer" cigarette may be found which will, on a permanent basis, satisfy the smoker on the one hand and appease the ent1-       w tobacco forces on the other is open to question.  Based on sales figures        5 of high filtration cigarettes and on Increasingly critical positions                    �

taken by the anti-tobacco forces, no compromise,'reasonab 1y "safe" product     w will sell or be free from attack for any extended period.   No matter what      fj

strides toward "safer" cigarettes are made, it appears unlikely that the anti-tobacco forces will rest for long. This may well mean that' the increasing quest for "safer" cigarettes is in the end self-defeating, since it leads ultimately to cigarettes wholly unsatisfying to the smoker (f> *  0), and the market vanishes*

Thus, unless some miraculous solution to the smoking-health problem is found, the present "safer" cigarette strategy, while prudent and    ) fruitful for the short term, may be equivalent to long term liquidation of the cigarette industry. This is largely due to the fact that the "safer" cigarette strategy 1s defensive in nature, and probably can never offer a positive, complete solution to the problem at hand which 1s acceptable to the consumer and to the tobacco critics.

If there is even a chance that the "safer" cigarette strategy may   \ fail to solve the smoking-health problem and may lead to the long range  \ self-defeating consequences indicated above, then it becomes imperative -that we consider alternate strategies and pursue them while we have the time and means"to do so.

1, The Proposed Mew Strategy

The use of cigarettes provides unique, valued gratifications to smokers which cannot now be obtained from use of any present non-tobacco product This must be true because in the face of the smoking-health controversy, large numbers of people begin to smoke end/or continue to smoke. Clearly a large market for our unique package of gratifications exists, and if the alleged health hazards could be eliminated a new, much larger market should emerge.

For the purposes of this discussion, it must be assumed that:   (1) nicotine, the physiological habituation factor in all tobacco products is a sine oua won., and (2) ingestion of small amounts of nicotine at controlled ratesdoes not constitute a significant hazard to health.

P � (H + G) - (C + R)

was used to relate the propensity of an Individual to smoke, P, to the positive (K ? G) and negative (C + R) factors Involved in smoking. If we now extend the definition of P to include propensity to smoke and propensity to obtain the satisfactions expected or derived from smoking via other products, the same bask equation becomes applicable to validation and execution of the new strategy proposed above.

��- Hat1Jtua_tlon FactorJH)_

It must be assumed that nicotine is the sine pua non of smoking. Accordingly, any substitute product probably EfsT deliver certain minimal quantities of nicotine, giving H a positive value.

b. Gratification Factor (G)

mm mm*   *�� mm   mm  mm<   mm   mm, mm   mm-   mm   mm  mm *�� * mm

If, by definition, all factors carrying significant health haiards are eliminated from new products, and the new products embody all of the gratifications - physical, social, ego, emotional, etc. � expected or derived from smoking, then the value of the gratification factor (G) becomes strongly positive.

the cost of the new products should be, in order of magnitude, similar to the cost of present tobacco products in terms of cost of use per day. Thus, the value of C would not materially change.

The new products should be designed to avoid regulations or taxes presently Imposed on cigarettes. Thus, the value of R should decrease.

From the above, the propensity for Individuals to use the new products (P) would be high as compared to propensity to smoke cigarettes because, with respect to cigarettes, the value of G would be sharply Increased, and the value of R would be decreased. Or, using arrows (+) to indicate change in our basic equation

f      t

P � (H + C) - {C + R)

If the above Is true, then the new products might be more than a                M

one-to-one substitute for cigarettes and should appeal to.a market                  . w

cigarettes.  Also, without the overhanging cloud of health hazard, the new market should grow with population growth.  This is. in euence, to be accomplished by giving'tho consumer what he wants% el^iina^ing those things that he does not want, and is thusTiflflv consumer^Wientod

E.   VALIDATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW STRATEGY

Chart I shows, in idealized form, the steps involved in validation and implementation of the proposed net; strategy.  These steps arc described on the following page.

I,     Formation of a Project Group

As implied above and aswill become Increasingly apparent in this discussion, validation and implementation of the new strategy will require the pooling of a variety of skills and activities.   Accordingly, an Initial project group representing the required disciplines and capabilities should be formed at the outset.

The initial function of the project group should be to critically consider the new strategy and, if appropriate, to determine its viability. If the strategy 1$ shown to be valid, then the project group would be responsible for planning and implementation.

The initial project group, with its own budget and with responsibility to a Corporate officer, should be composed of members with knowledge in the following areas:   physical and biological sciences, marketing research and behavioral science, regulatory situations and patent law, planning, literature resources, and cost estimation.  Although many of these skills are present in the Corporation, it is expected that services of outside consultants, laboratories, and the like would also be required.

II,    Evaluation of the Role and Use of Nicotine (H)

If, as stated repeatedly above, nicotine 1s believed to be the sine   ' qua non of smoking or use of substitute products then:   (1) this shouidoe verified, and  (2) the possible health hazards associated with Ingestion of nicotine in the minimum quantities required should be thoroughly evaluated.   This will require careful review of published data and, very probably, further laboratory research.

If it appears likely from all standpoints, including possible FDA interference, that products containing minimal amounts of nicotine may be marketed, then it will be appropriate to move to the next step.

HI.   Identification of Gratifications Desired or Expected (6)

fiiiTiiV.......... in     �  ii i   i'       �!��  '�����M��^^J.*wM.MM^hMi.wi..Ji>wiiiw<wwwwiw**i.

If the gratifications expected or derived from smoking are to be designed into the new products, It becomes highly important to identify these factors and to rank them 1n terms of economic importance.  This will be a task to be performed by Marketing Research and behavioral scientists.

As a start, the gratifications to be studied might be classified as:

Physical Gratifications

1.    Physiological response -nicotine, other,

2.    Manipulative � opening package, handling product.

3.    Sensory - flavor, visual perceptions, etc.

4.    Oral - sucking, chewing, mouth feel.

5.    Other - tension releasing activity, etc,

Social Gratifications

1,    Croup identification - sharing an activity, etc.

2,    Release from social tensions - a pause to re-group, something

to do with hands, etc.

3,    Other

Ego Gratifications

1.    Emulation of valued person - parent, adult, etc.

2.    Aesthetics - doing a valued thing

3.     Other                                                         �

Ideally, gratifications would be identified and ranked in Importance for various population classes, such as smokers and non-smokers, age classes economic classes, religious and ethnic classes, and the like.   Results of this study would indicate what gratifications the new products should provide, and would show the relative economic value to be attached to each gratification,

Accompanying this study should be an investigation of the acceptability ' to potential users of the theoretical substitute products.

With these studies completed, it should be possible to establish theoretical, idealized product specifications and to predict, grossly; the size of the potential market.

various types of new products.

vi    r*wn n�w Product Speculations to New Products

As Indicated in Chart l\ above, after practical new'p^^^^ have been defined, the remaining steps in translating the WWWg"�int� newproducts for ale are essentially the same as those fo lowed in th_ Elation of any new product.   No realistic plan or schedule for accomplishing those steps can be made at the time of this writing.

F.   PRELIMINARY ACTIVITY AND PROGRESS

Although various elements of the concepts and strategy presented herein had been discussed at random on an intuitive basis over some years prior to this study, no concerted effort had been made to formulate a conceptual model or unified plan.   In the fall of 1968, the writer became convinced that a new business strategy was needed, and began to formulate the concepts, strategies and plans which are the subject of this discussion.  In the course of that effort, the basic concept was discussed with many people, all of whom made valuable contributions, as did the existing literature bearing on the general area under consideration.

t                            i

Concurrent with the largely Intellectual activity associated with developing concepts and plans, some preliminary laboratory work was begun. in the Chemical Division on development of prototype materials and devices which might be incorporated into the intended new products.  It was felt that some tangible evidence showing that the proposed new products are technically feasible would generate interest in the proposed effort and help bring It into view for consideration.

The sections below describe, in bare detail, the various prototype products under consideration and/or study*

I.   A Transitional Cigarette-like Device

III.    Atavistic

A chewable product (gum?) containing tobacco flavors and nicotine.

The nicotine should be partly free (immediate response) and partly bound (slow-release capsule?).

Isn't this really an aesthetically clean chewing tobacco - safe* sanitary* with a well-established history of customer gratification.

Ideally, the total product should dissolve slowly, release nicotine slowly, producing soluble materials suitable for Ingestion. The vehicles should perhaps be chewable to some degree, like "Jerky1** but not gunny,

IV. Other

Many other delivery systems for nicotine, flavor, etc., have been considered but not reduced to practice. Among these are beverages, Inhaler devices, and edible products.

G. CONCLUSIONS WD RECORDATIONS

The concepts, strategies and plans presented above have been considered In depth over a period of one year. After searching analysis, the proposed new strategy continues to appear useful 1n that 1t Is devised to provide the consumer what he wants, without hazard, and at great potential profit to the , supplier. The proposed new strategy H also attractive because 1t provides a positive opportunity to this Corporation while successfully circumventing problems arising from the srooking-health controversy.

Having already recommended study and. validation of the proposed new strategy, it would be Illogical, despite strong personal convictions, to here urge its immediate adoption. Gather,, it is again recommended that a project group be assembled to consider and, if appropriate, work toward validation of the proposed strategy.

If indeed the proposed new strategy is practical and useful, it behooves us to consider 1t promptly before some other organization does. During the course of this work, an account (Exhibit 1) of a competitor's activity 1n this same general area came to light, re-enforcing the above statement.

Clearly, the present discussion cannot be considered to be the final word. Rather, it is hoped that it may represent a point of departure for �evolution of profitable new products. That evolution "will result from the criticisms, suggestions, Information and ideas provided by others who may become involved.

Dear Mr. CVFallon:

This is a response to your letter of November 17.

(inclosed are copies of documents from our John W. Hill Papers. They have been certified in the same manner used when we have provided copies to others involved in tobacco industry litigation. Also enclosed is a copy of the Jolin W. Hill Register and the inventory of documents which you provided.

I ne Hill Register, which you have numbered JH 000001 through JH 000029, was prepared by State Historical Society of Wisconsin staff to describe the organization and content of the Hill papers. It is intended as a guide to facilitate the research use of the Hill papers by our patrons.

The John W. 1 fill Papers were acquired by the Society as part of a program, begun in the mid 1950s, to collect manuscripts and other research materials on the history of public relations and advertising in United States. The Hill papers are one of a large number of collections covering this subject area primarih used by historians and other scholars. The vast majority of ihe John W. Hill papers, including the Tobacco Industry Research Council files, were donated to the Society by Mr. Hill in April 19(>4. Seven additional small installments of Hill papers were received from Hill, his widow, and two other individuals between May 1964 and May 1990. John W. Hill signed an agreement (copy attached) formally transferring ownership of the papers ro the Society on September 11,1964,

Most of the papers which now comprise boxes 142 of the collection were made available for i esearch shortly after receipt by the Society. In accordance with the September 11,1964 agreement, The Tobacco Industry Research Council files and other "Client Files" (boxes 43-112) were not made available to researchers until January, 1989.

In comparing the copies with the original Hill papers I noted the following minor errors in your

In 1927 the Union Trust Company of Cleveland offend his (J5C0 a month to act as its public relations counselor.   Since he did not believe this was sufficient inducement to establish a public relations office, he countered with an off3r to represent the bank provided its chairman halped secure additional clients.   The bank's chairman immediately recommended hia to influential men in industry and business, and John ;*. Hill was launched on a career that was to see him become head of one of the nation's largest public relations firms, an organization referred to by Irwin Ross

The name of Hill and Khcwlion came into being in 1933 when Donald Xncwlton, advertising manager for the Union Trust Company, joined Mr. Hill in establishing a partnership.   In that year also the American Iron and Steal Institute retained the firm as its public relations counsel, and Mr. Hill moved to Hew York to establish an office.  While serving his growing number of clients with astute success and a reputation for integrity, he also expanded his firm's activities.   In 19t7 Don Knowlton took over direction of Hill and Khowlton of Cleveland, and Mr. Hill turned his entire attention to Hill and Knowlton, Inc. in New York City.   In the ensuing year3 the Hew York firm branched out to Washington, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Cleveland, and Los Angelas.   Contacts were begun with foreign public relations counselors in 195?. and by 1958 Kill and Knovaton International was veil established, maintaining offices' in"Dusseldcrf, The rfague, and Sydney, and associates in as many as eirht other foreign cities.

Hill took great pride in the fact that Hill 6 Knowlton, lac, never solicited clients*    Nevertheless, it represented sons of the nation's largest industrial associations and companies in the fields of aircraft, agricultural equipnent, automobiles, petroleum, food, electrical appliances, chemicals, licensed beverages, and tobacco*   Among its clients were the American Iron and Steel Institute, the American Butter Institute, the Retail Drygoods Association, the Tobacco Industry Research Council, Aircraft Industries Association, the Licensed Beverage Industries, Manufacturing Chemists Association, AYCO Manufaccurlng Corp., Texaco, Procter and Gamble, Standard Oil of Ohio, and the Brussels Worlds Pair of 1958*

John Hill brought into his organization experienced staff with talents sufficiently diverse to meet the needs of the clients*   From the small partnership of 1933 the number of employees in the Hill organization grew to seventy by 19*5 and to approximately 250 by the early 1960's.    The firm's technical services and facilities included personnel trained in community relations, educational research, publicity and promotion, public speaking, publications, financial relations, and art.   Over the years its strength was augmented by the acquisition of other firms such as Edward W. Barrett and Associates, Robinson-hannagan Associates, and Group Attitudes, Inc.   By 1960 Printers Ink reported that the firm was rated by its colleagues as the best such agency in the nation*   At the time its annual gross billing was said to exceed three end one half million dollars*

For many years Bill served eg member and chairman of the Board of Visitors of the School of Public Relations and Communications at Boston university, and In 1950 the John W. Hill Chair of Economic Communications was established there. Throughout his career Hill wrote and spoke widely on the subject of public relations and he was the author of two books, Corporate Public Relations (1958) and The Making of t Public Relations Man (1963).

After bis retirement as president of the company Hill maintained bis position as chairman of the board.   In addition, he spent a great deal of time in Europe working in behalf of Bill & Knowltou, Internaclonal.   Hill died in 1977.

Arrangement

The papers are arranged *� GZNEIIAL C$PJABPONDENCE, CHRONOLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCE, INTERFAX FILES, WRITINGS, and CLIENT FILES*

Scope and Content

The bulk of the John W. Hill papers were donated to the State Historical Society of Wisconsin in 1964.   Because the client files (originally six four-drawer file cebicets) were closed until 1989 only the general correspondence and Hill's writings were arranged and described la 1964; the remaining papers were organized in1992 after they became available for

1

JH 000004
pgNbr=498
Hill-Rag.-4

research. Understanding of the overall nature of the collection was consequently limited by the Inability of the Axchlvea staff to examine all of the collection at one time In Its original condition.

It is likely that the files at the Historical Society do not represent the Hill (t Kd owl ton company records, but rather those papers that were housed In Hill's own office. As a result, while tha material about high level relations with staff and clients is excellent and extensive, many of the day-to-day aspects of the firm's public relations work (Including the company's financial status) are unrepresented. The files also do not represent all H&R clients, and the absence of this material from the collection is unexplained.

Overall, however, the papers reveal a great deal concerning the mind and method of a major public relations counselor and the way In which a large firm such as Bill & Kaowlton operated. Because John Hill case to know his clients so well one can find In the collection not only Information pertaining to the public relations programs designed by H&K but also a good deal of general Information concerning the Internal operations and administration of the client company or association* Vlth regard to the American Iron and Steel Institute this documentation is also present for a number of individual companies that comprised the trade association such as Inland Steel, Republic Steel, and Bethlehem Steel. Hill shared a conservative political philosophy with many of his clients, and discussions of stste and national politics forms a good part of the correspondence. (This it particularly evident in the AVCO and the American Iron and Steel Institute files.)

Hill's early career and the early years of Hill A Kaowlton are incompletely covered here, as the documentation in the collection essentially begins in 1947 (the year in which Hill A Kaowlton was incorporated and Bill moved from Cleveland to New York City), thirteen years after Hill & Knowlton was established and began to represent the American Iron and Steel Institute. The disposition of the papers covering Rill's early career and the early years la the company's history is unknown.

The Hill papers include correspondencej memoranda; minutesj reports*, and draft and final copies of a variety of public relations products such as programs, prass releases, pamphlets, and advertising.

broken Into three series, GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE, INTERNAL FIXES, and CHRONOLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCE. The GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE and tha INTERNAL FILES (originally listed as Rill A Kaowlton, Inc. In the 1964 register) are both arranged alphabetically by name and/or subject, the CHRONOLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCE Is arranged by year.

The GENERAL CORRESPONDENCE consists largely of letters about relations with individuals and organisations that ware neither RAX employee* nor clienta, while the INTERNAL FILES chiefly consist of material about internal administrative matters. The distinction is not precise, however, end some correspondence with RAX staff (especially for tha period before 1952) may be

found In the General Correspondence. In addition, there Is soot . correspondence here with individuals also documented in the CLIENT FILES. The Internal files also document relations with R&K's International affiliates.

The CHRONOLOGICAL CORRESPONDENCE consists primarily of copies of Hill's outgoing letters, with the period 1947 to 1964 being the best documented* Although this series appears to duplicate at least part of the Sill correspondence elsewhere in the collection, the file has been retained primarily because of the chronological overview it provides of Rill's activities.

The WRITINGS series consists of material by Hill and a few other employees of the firm such as Bert Goss and Don Rnowlton, as well as an internal staff newsletter and a few other publications of the company* Hill's writing is documented by a chronological file of speeches, articles, and Interviews, and drafts of two published books and his unfinished history of Hill & Knowl ton.

The CLIENT FILES are arranged alphabetically by company or trade association name or keyword. The files vary greatly In sire, some consisting only of a few items, others consisting of many boxes. The most extensive client files (Aircraft Industries Association, AVCO Manufacturing Corp., Licensed Beverage Industries, Manufacturing Chemists Association, National Gas and Oil Resource Committee, National Retail Dry Goods Associations, and the Tobacco Industry Research Council) are subdivided alphabetically by topic, name, or document type, with most client files beginning, as they did in Hill*a office, with a general category, Because of their variety the research questions to which the client files may be applied also vary. Some files document limited public relations services such as revision of an executive's speech or introduction of a particular product. Clients for which H6K provided tore comprehensive services (such as AVCO and AXSX) are represented by important documentation not only about the development of the public relations program but also about the client's internal operations* Information about collective bargaining in the steel Industry, the health effects Of cigarette smoking, and the taxation of oleomargarine are only a few of the interesting and significant topics that
