DIRECT EXAMINATION BY MR. BASS:

Q.  Good morning, Dr. Cummings.

A.  Good morning.

Q.  You just introduced yourself to the jury.  Could you please tell the members of the jury where you work and what it is you do there?

A.  Sure.  I'm a professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the

	MR. BASS:

	THE COURT:
	That's not us.
	I don't know

where
	i   that feedback is coming from.
		Everybody can

hear
	it, right, because it's already

and I
	've only been here 30 seconds.
		


	I don't know where that's

It' s

that
	might be.  There
	's a lot of equ
	ipment in here

that
	could be causing
	that.
	


	All right.
	Go ahead, sir.

interrupting.

MR. BASS:  May it please the Court. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Dr. Cummings, before October 2011, when you went to the Medical University of South Carolina, where did you work and for how long did you work there?

A.  I was at Roswell Park Cancer Institute which is a Comprehensive Cancer Center located in Buffalo, New York.  I spent a little over 30 years working there, since 1981.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Hang on.

Number Juror 22 is here.  I don't know if that means you can't hear or it's just annoying or what?

JUROR BROWN:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Which?  Both?

JUROR BROWN:  Both.

THE COURT:  Okay.  That speaker is connected to the microphone for the doctor and it is on and as you see when I do this, it comes up, right, and when I turn it completely off, can you hear anything out of that?

JUROR BROWN:  No.

THE COURT:  So whatever the feedback is isn't coming from that speaker I don't think. It's coming from someone else in the room.

I apologize again, Mr. Bass.  All right. If you want me to just keep it off and let the doctor speak up, I can do that too if that's better for all of you.

Which do you prefer?  You guys have to

THE WITNESS:  I'm happy to speak loudly if you'd like.

THE COURT: I'll turn it up like this and you let me know if it starts to bother you, raise your hand.  Okay.

I'm sorry, Mr. Bass.  Go ahead, sir.

MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May it please the Court.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Dr. Cummings, you were telling the members of the jury where you worked prior to the Medical University of South Carolina and how long you were there?

A.  Right.  I spent a little over 30 years at Roswell Park Cancer Institute which is located

in Buffalo, New York.

Q.  Now we're going to take the jury through your extensive qualifications, but before we do that, if you could just generally tell the members of the jury, what were some of your responsibilities during your 30 years at Roswell Park?

A.  I was in the � it's a Comprehensive Cancer Center, and I was a research scientist there, started out as a junior scientist and rose up the ranks, basically doing tobacco-related work.

I set up the stop smoking clinics at Roswell Park, eventually set up services for all of New York State.  I created and operated the New York State Smokers Quitline, which is a free telephone service for smokers to call.

I created a Department of Health Behavior and Health Education for Roswell Park.  I headed up their prevention program for a number of years.

So I was a department chair and rose up the ranks to senior scientist, and so I did research.  I also taught graduate students.  We had master's and Ph.D. students.

1219

I probably have trained over 100 master students and probably about 30 or 40 Ph.D. students at my time at Roswell.

Q.  And you may have been inherent in your answer, but if you could tell us what topic has

on?

A.  It's been mainly focused, I'd say 90, 95 percent, on tobacco-related issues, the effects of tobacco on cancer, the � obviously, smoking behavior, both uptake and cessation of tobacco, but in my other responsibilities, I served on the Infection Control Committee at the hospital.

I did work on cancer screening kinds of work.  So anything related to cancer control and prevention activities I was involved with, but 90, 95 percent of my research grants and publications are on tobacco.

Q.  And when did your interest in cigarette smoking and those that smoke develop?

A.  Really when I came to Roswell Park. People started calling our hospital.  We used to have the Seventh-day Adventists come in once a year to run a stop smoking program for us.

And so I set up a program that ran more

frequently and really my interest in tobacco and

trying to understand why people were struggling to stop smoking, why they felt miserable right after they quit, were gaining weight.

And that really forms � in fact, my early papers that I did when I was at Roswell were really just describing the circumstances that I observed people having when they came to a Cancer Center.

You'd think coming to a Cancer Center that would be enough just to get somebody to stop smoking, but it certainly wasn't.

And then got involved in developing treatments and testings treatments to help people quit.  So we tested the gum and the patches and combinations of those up to the point where we were testing vaccines to help people quit, vaccine therapy that created antibodies for nicotine before it could hit the brain to block the affect of nicotine in the brain so to lower reward.  So that was a trial that I was involved in in Roswell.

Q.  Why, Dr. Cummings, would a dedicated Cancer Center like Roswell Park be interested in

developing a smoking cessation clinic program?

A.  Well, there's several reasons, but the number one reason is a third of all cancer deaths are due to smoking.

So that's the biggest reason, but even with the cancer patients, we find that the therapies that we give to patients, chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, those do not work as well, if people are smoking.

So the treatment outcomes are poorer. So to give our patients the best opportunity for success in their therapy, smoking cessation is an important part of that.

That's true with a lot of other medical conditions other than cancer, but I worked at a Cancer Center, and that's one of the reasons that � the Hollings Cancer Center currently at

18 MUSC has a dedicated program for our cancer

patients that I helped set up as well as we have a service for all of the 27,000 patients that come into our � as in-patients to our hospital at the

22 medical center, for stroke and COPD and just a

variety of different conditions that people have that bring them to the hospital.

Roswell Park and you got involved in trying to help people get off and stay off cigarettes, have you reminded involved in tobacco and cigarette-related issues?

A.  Sure.  I mean working at a Cancer Center, being a research scientist, one of the things you have to do is write grants and get funding.

And so as I got involved in running the cessation services, and, you know, really there were a lot of questions in my mind that arose based on what I was observing.

And if you follow my research career, it really follows the research grants that I then was getting really fall around the issue of trying to help patients stay off of cigarettes, later doing things on populations of smokers, tracking them over decades, genetics of addiction, to prevention kinds of issues as well.

So it's covered sort of the gamut, but it really started from the early clinical work that I got involved in doing when I first arrived at Roswell.

Q.  Before we kind of go through your CV, there are two unique aspects of your experience

that I'd like to highlight up front for the jury, and the first aspect of that experience is if you could please tell us about your management of a cigarette testing laboratory at Roswell Park?

A.  Sure.  In the early 2000s, I created a cigarette testing lab as part of one of the research activities that we were doing at Roswell.

It's essentially back engineering the cigarettes to do two things we were interested in. One is, are there differences between the cigarettes in terms of how they're engineered, and how does that affect how people smoke?

So one was to compare the cigarettes that were out there as well as to then evaluate again how different aspects of cigarettes, the blends that are used in the product, the different additives that are put in it, the way the filter is constructed, the paper that's used, the additives on the paper and so on, how that would affect somebody's smoking behavior and ultimately did that relate to their ability to quit smoking.

Did it influence the exposures that they got, which is related to the diseases?  So we set up that lab, collected cigarettes from all over the world.

We actually followed the cigarettes over time so we'd look at like Marlboro or, you know, Salem or whatever the brand might be and look at those products over time to see if they were the same or whether they changed over time, used different blends, different additives, slightly different design features, again, to try to understand how that influences smoking behavior and the exposures that cause the diseases.

Q.  How did this cigarette testing laboratory at Roswell Park come about?

A.  Well, I created the idea of doing this because I was involved in understanding human smoking behavior, and we were doing small, little studies and so on, but I created the lab and pitched the idea as part of a large grant that I wrote to the National Cancer Institute.

These were center grants, so they had

19 multiple research projects as part of this.  I was

sort of the lead of the center of excellence in tobacco-related research that the National Cancer Institute funded.

And the lab was one of the projects that we created.  That was in � early 2000, we set up the lab.  I think we got funding for it beginning

in 2004, and it's continued to be funded ever since.

It's probably one of the larger labs outside of sort of commercial entities.  So this is more of an academic research lab, and then of course the industry has huge amounts of � they've been doing this laboratory work for a number of years.

So the industry documents have become available around that time.  So we were learning from those internal business records of the company how they were studying their cigarettes, how they were studying their competitors' cigarettes and what the affects were on their consumers.

And we were, you know, replicating some of those studies and extending those studies to try to understand aspects of how the cigarette is constructed and how that influences human smoking behavior.

So we still have grants that are funding that. It's been funded continuously now for about ten years.

Q.  That was the next question I was going to ask you was even though you're no longer at

Roswell Park, do you still have involvement in cigarette testing laboratory there?

A.  I do.  I still oversee the research program.  We had a center grant for five years and now we have a � what they call a program project which is a similar kind of, you know, multigrant program that I lead, funded by the National Cancer Institute.

And the tobacco lab is part of that.

queue to look at other types of tobacco products that are coming out, like E-cigarettes and those kinds of things.

Q.  Two terms, although the jury is probably familiar with them, one, National Cancer Institute or NCI, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  What is that?

A.  Well, that's part of the National Institute of Health, and it's the unit of that larger entity, the National Institutes of Health, that focuses on cancer.

So it's the largest of the National Institutes of Health, and they fund most of the

25 medical research in the areas of treatment, early

detection, and prevention of disease.

Obviously, the Cancer Center focuses on cancer.  The National Institutes on drug abuse, they funded some of my work as well, they focus on drug addictions.

So nicotine is one of the areas that they focus their research on.

Q. The other term, a grant. You used that a few times. If you could please tell us what a grant is?

A. Yeah. A grant is � essentially, it's a work plan. It's a proposal you put together with a research question or a hypothesis that you want to test.

You try to pitch the idea that the question you posed is significant, that the findings from the research will add to scientific knowledge and advance our understanding of the particular topic you're focused on.

You outline a methodology for carrying out the research, a budget to do the project.  You send it into the National Institutes of Health, the National Cancer Institute or NIDA or whatever group it might be or even private foundations.

And they get lots of these from people

like myself who are doing research, and it's a competitive process.  I think the NIH now is funding about six of every hundred applications it gets .

So, you know, 94 out of 100 of those applications, all the work to put the business plan together doesn't get funded.  You know, about six out of 100 get funded.

And there's a peer-review process to figure out which of the grants � you know, there's a scoring system with people who have expertise supposedly in your area that are reviewing the grants for their significance and scientific merit and how they will advance the science and so on.

And, you know, based on that scoring system, that's how the government figures out which, you know, projects get funded and how to

19 move the science forward.

Q.  How much grant in contract money have you been awarded over the course of your career to conduct research?

A.  Well, I've been at it for 34 years now. So it's probably close to 80 million, I'd say, at this point.  These are grants.  They don't come to

Roswell Park when I was there, and they come to the Medical University of South Carolina.

And then those are grants that I lead. So I'm, you know, designated as the principal investigator and then you execute the plan and you hire the staff or buy the equipment that you need to do the research, and that's what the budget goes for.

And you write up your reports, publish them in scientific journals, and presumably that's how science moves forward.

Q.  Now prior to the development of the cigarette lab, had you been studying design features, design aspects of cigarettes?

A.  Yes.  My first, you know, research grant that I got on cigarette design in the mid '90s, was on the cigarette filter, and aspects of how cigarette filters were constructed, different types of filters, and the defects in filters with the material on the filter actually dislodging during smoking and being ingested into the body because we were observing, we had made observations that the filter material would come off fairly easily.

And we would find it in the lungs of smokers when we did autopsies on people who had been smoking filtered cigarettes.  We'd find filter material which had some of the chemicals from cigarette tar.

So it was like getting concentrating dosing of the tar into the lungs and other parts of the body that cause cancer.

Q.  Since that time, have you published in the area of cigarette design features?

A.  Yeah, I've published, you know, dozens of articles on cigarette design, have written chapters in Surgeon General's report on cigarette design.

I've done monographs on cigarette design and product � as it relates to product regulation.  I'm doing one now for the World Health Organization on product regulation which describes how all kinds of different products all over the world are constructed, how that relates to the types of exposures that people get from the product, and how that influences the diseases that we see associated with different kinds of products, cigarettes, cigars, pipes, oral tobacco, dissolvables.

You can go down the list.  There's a wide array of different kinds of tobacco products.

Q.  And so why is that important in your field of study, Dr. Cummings, to have an understanding of the different design elements or features of a cigarette?

A.  Well, cigarettes are probably the most lethal of all the tobacco products.  About one out of two users of cigarettes, long-term users will get sick as a result of using the product.

And so I've been involved obviously as I described some of the research being at a Cancer Center.  Why do people get cancer?  What are the products that � what are the exposures that lead to that cancer?

And so when you look at diseases like, you know, lung cancer and throat cancer and so on, you're talking about 90 percent or so of those cases caused by cigarettes.

So that's why I got involved with it, because if you can eliminate that � I mean I work at a Cancer Center in prevention.  So I'm trying to prevent people from having to come to our hospital.  That's been my job.

Q.  The other � as far as � strike that.

The other issue I wanted to highlight up front before we take a step back was � and you alluded to it.  You were talking about the cigarette design, laboratory, was, explain to the jury how you came to be involved in the possession and custody of the previously confidential or secret internal company documents of tobacco companies?

A.  Well, there's a story there.  I started in the '90s looking at patents.  Those are public documents, so patents on cigarette design and cigarette filters.  That was part of the research that we were doing.

But as the agreements between the different state Attorney Generals and the cigarette companies required the companies to put on their public websites �

MR. BELASIC:  Objection.  Litigation, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  That's overruled.

For you folks, just so you don't think I'm not paying attention, I have a running transcript of everything everybody is saying so I keep close attention over here.

Go ahead, Mr. Bass.

1           THE WITNESS:  So anyway, the business

2 records became available on public websites.  Some

3 of the records actually got turned over to me.

4 There are two organizations, the Tobacco Institute

5 and the Council for Tobacco Research, which were

6 organizations funded by the cigarette

7 manufacturers got turned over to New York State, their Attorney General there.

9                        And the Attorney General of New York

10 State contacted me, knew of my work, which was

11 pretty well known in New York at that time in the

12 late '90s, and asked me if I wanted the materials.

13           I said:  Yes.  And, voila, about 16

14 tnillion pages of internal business records,

literally all the office documents from those two organizations got turned over to me.

I got grant funding to digitize it because it came in paper form.  There were also video and audiotapes.

I hired very smart people, librarians who really knew how to digitize and organize documents.  I hired people who were expert in scanning material.

A lot of that scanning technology at that time was really just coming online.  People

who were developing software for optical scan recognition which we sort of take for granted today, but at the time that was a new technology.

We developed an indexing system, the librarians, and that indexing system turned out to be very useful for all of the public documents because each company put up the documents, but they had different search strategies making it very hard to go in and find anything.

We developed a way to search across all the company websites on different topics using keyword searches, using OCR and so on, and so it was really our group that helped set up the ability to go now look at what amounts to about 60

15 million pages of internal business records that

got put up online.

We created the virtual library.  So you could put in keyword searches and look for aspects of cigarette design or issues around particular brands or particular topics like nicotine and what was known or the health effects of cigarettes and what was known internally by the companies versus what they were saying publicly.

And so I was writing grants to study some of these research questions.  I was getting

funding from the National Cancer Institute to do this .

And now those materials are all available online at the University of California, San Francisco website.  We collected a lot of them and then turned them over to that website which is the basis for a lot of people, not just myself, who were doing research on the internal business records.

And it has been very useful to informing the research that I was doing, trying to understand why people smoke, why they find it hard to stop, and what exposures they get.

That's all very relevant when you start looking at the internal business records of the company.

Q.  You said you received 16 million pages initially.  How many pages of the previously secret internal tobacco company documents are now publicly available?

A.  There's 60 million total.  So we scanned 16.  The companies put up digital records, but the records that came to New York State from the Tobacco Institute and the Council for Tobacco Research were in hard copy form.

So we actually had to learn the process of scanning them and digitizing them and organizing them in ways that were useful.

Q.  You said that the release of these previously internal � previously secret internal company documents assisted you in your research on particular issues.

Did it also help others, researchers like yourself in your field?

A.  Yes.  I mean it was extraordinarily helpful to informing the kinds of studies that I was doing on human smoking behavior and other people who had interest in marketing or other topics.

Certainly there was information that was useful to them.  And it's now been incorporated.

17 Most of the public, you know, scientific

literature that I read now usually is making reference to the internal business records.

It's certainly been incorporated in the Surgeon General's reports on smoking and health to inform us about why people get sick as a result of smoking, what was known about nicotine addiction, how the products are engineered to be addictive.

And it's important to public education.

I do work with smokers still.  So in educating smokers, I mean as that information became available, it was highly relevant to my ability to be able to communicate to smokers, not that it's hard to quit.  Most smokers figure that out when they try.

But why, and, you know, that, I think, helps.  It doesn't make it easy to stop smoking even when you know why, but it helps to know why. And that has been � I've incorporated it in our programs that we do with smokers.

Q.  Has the availability of these documents � you said that the Surgeon General has relied on these documents, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Has the availability of these documents led to changes in scientific opinion about certain aspects of cigarettes in smoking behavior?

A.  Yes.

Q.  How so?

A.  Well, it's helped us to try to understand why the relative risks of cigarette smoking continue to go up.  In other words, smokers today seem to be at higher risk for certain types of cancer, COPD, heart disease, with

cigarettes today after the introduction of filters, after the introduction of trying to lower the machine level tar and nicotine, contrary to what a lot of people believed was going to be the case.

And so understanding how the product was engineered has helped us try to explain why we've seen this increase, and certainly those documents are highly important to the government's effort today to try to regulate the companies.

They have to understand that these products are not static.  They've been constantly

13 modified over years, and consumers didn't know.

The public health community didn't know.

The companies consider their brand formulas trade secrets.  We still don't know.

Q.  Has � in addition to informing members of the public health community like the Surgeon General, has these internal � have these internal company documents also been the basis of books?

A.  Sure.  There are a variety of books that have been written on different topics, you know, the basic topics, when was it known that smoking caused disease.

When did the companies know that their

products caused cancer?  What were they telling people about that?

Again, what about nicotine addiction? You know, you have these Surgeon General's report that talked about smoking at different points in time as a lifestyle choice, when clearly internally the business records of the cigarette companies were talking about it as a drug addiction.

And engineered their product so they didn't go too low in the amount of nicotine.  We now know that the companies could make cigarettes without nicotine.

You can go back and find patents for removal of nicotine into the '20s.  You can grow tobacco without nicotine in it.

Tobacco leaves are blended for different amounts of nicotine.  So this is all known.

MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I believe that question was � that answer was nonresponsive.  I know this is background, but the question was: Have there books been written, and I'm just having trouble following where that testimony is going for purposes of understanding what objections

So you may proceed, Mr. Bass.

May it please the Court. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Dr. Cummings, does one such book � are you familiar with the cigarette papers by Stanton Glantz, for example? A.  Yes.

Q.  Are you familiar with how the documents that form the basis of this book were received by

16 Mr. Glantz?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  If you could please explain that to the jury?

A.  Well, there were documents that � I

21 mean the story is that documents came out of the

internal vaults of Brown & Williamson, the paralegal, Merrill Williams, and somehow those documents became available to a select few folks. Dan Glantz who was a well known tobacco

control researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, their library received the documents.

I think a reporter from The New York Times received them.  And these were just an early glimpse of some of the documents, but what they showed is � and these came out of Brown & Williamson, which is just one of the companies, but what the documents revealed is all the companies were talking to each other and that there was stuff that was done as a conspiracy among the companies, and that all became available and was written up as the book.

Also there is a whole issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association that was devoted to these, you know � there were four banker boxes of documents.

I got a chance, because I know Dr. Glantz pretty well, to look at the documents when they first became available.

And this was in the '90s, and it was an eye opener to those of us who had been trying to help people quit smoking, you know, working to try to educate the public what we were reading for the first time with the internal business records.

What I normally like to do a little bit earlier on in the process is simply preview for the jury, although they probably got a sense from

of the topics you're going to cover with the jury.

Are you prepared to discuss nicotine addiction in general and whether Mary Cooper was addicted to nicotine in cigarettes?

A.  I am.

Q.  Are you prepared to discuss with the jury whether young people like Mary Cooper, when she started smoking, were specifically targeted by cigarette companies?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Are you prepared to discuss how the engineering and design of cigarettes influences smoking behavior?

A.  I am.

engineering and design of cigarettes influences addiction to nicotine?

A.  Yes.

Q.  How the design features make it, cigarette smoking, hard to quit?

A.  Correct.

Q. And are you prepared to discuss certain aspects of the 50-year conspiracy and its impact on addicted smokers?

A.  I am happy to discuss what I call the 50-year cover-up.

Q.  Please tell the jury, Dr. Cummings, about your educational background.

A.  Went to Miami, Ohio, another Miami, up in Oxford, Ohio, did undergraduate degree in health education and physical education.  I was going to be a teacher.

Senior year, I got an internship working in the New Jersey Department of Health.  I lived in New Jersey.  So that was the summer job I got.

And I was doing public health education, and I was encouraged to apply to � to do a public health education program and I enjoyed doing that work during the summer.

And so I wrote to one institution, the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=36
1244

1 University of Michigan, School of Public Health.

2 That's where the person who was mentoring me

3 during the summer had done their master's of

4 public health.

5           I got in.  They gave me a scholarship to

6 go there.  So I went to the University of

7 Michigan, did a master's of public health and then

8 got interested in doing research and got another

9 scholarship to do a Ph.D. in public health, health

10 behavior and health education.

11           And so I continued to do that until I

12 got a real job and didn't depend on my wife at

13 that point to keep supporting me.

14           I went to Wayne State University.  I

15 taught there for about 18 months.  It was sort of

16 an interim as I was finishing up my Ph.D., as a

17 junior professor and then I was offered a job at

18 Roswell Park in 1981, and worked there for, you

19 know, a little over 30 years until I came to the

20 Medical University of South Carolina because all

21 my kids have now grown up and the grandchildren

22 all live in Charleston.

23           They moved south out of Buffalo and all

24 work there, which is what stimulated me to � they

25 offered me a job in the same place.  I said:  This

is not going to happen very often.

So that's why I moved down to South Carolina.  A big culture shock for somebody from New York to move to Charleston, but it's been very nice.

Q.  One of the things we'll do as we go along is when you use a term that I'd like � well, the jury might know about it, I'll ask you to define it.

Could you tell us what public health is, please?

A.  Sure.  Public health is the study of populations, human populations.  So we look at really three things, you know, time, geographic variation and disease patterns, so temporal changes.

Are diseases going up or down?  Like an epidemic is when you see a rapid increase in the number of diseases that might happen in a population.

Looking at geographic variations, so differences in different areas, and then characteristics of individuals as they relate to disease patterns, age, gender, race, smoking characteristics, and then you can cross all of

those time patterns by, you know, characteristics of individuals.

And that's really to try to help us understand what's affecting the disease rates in a population for the purposes of then trying to develop intervention strategies to mitigate those, you know, trends, to try to lower the disease rates, and that's what public health is.

Medicine focuses on one person at a time.  Public health focuses on populations of people, which is really the difference.

Q.  Dr. Cummings, do you consider yourself by virtue of your education, training, and experience to be a member of the public health community?

A.  Sure, yeah.

Q.  And how so?

A.  Well, I have a degree � two degrees in public health, a master's of public health and a Ph.D., and I focus on the population issues related to cancer.

I mean that's really � I taught epidemiology which is, you know, the methods for studying these patterns and populations and evaluating prevention interventions to graduate

students for 25 years.

Obviously, I focused on human behavior and behavioral patterns because of my training and background, which is probably why I'm interested in � got interested in tobacco, because when it comes to the cancer problem, it's the number one thing that's driving cancer rates.

Q.  You've already spoken to us about Roswell Park and some of your experiences there. One aspect about it though that I wanted to ask you about was, you told us early on that you developed the New York State Quitline?

A.  Correct.

Q.  If you could please tell us a little bit

15 more about that, please?

A.  Sure.  It's a telephone � toll-free telephone service.  I've been running groups.  I still run the groups even at MUSC now, but these were classes where you have 20, 30 people would come in.

I'd run them once or twice a month, and had reached, probably in my 30 years, about 10,000 smokers, which sounded like a lot.

In 1998, I pitched the idea to the New York State Health Department that they ought to

create a toll-free telephone number that people could call to get help to quit smoking, and we could service many more people.

So I got a grant for $60,000, and we created telephone � we created an 800 number people could call, a website, and nobody calls if they don't know about it.  We got the governor to put out a press release in 2000, January of 2000.

A lot of people like to make their New Year's resolution.  That put us on the map.  We started getting calls and developed, you know, quick guides and self-help materials.

And then that program grew over time and then we started doing detailed assessments on people's nicotine dependence, providing therapies to people.

We've done all kinds of studies with people, and so during the period from 2000 really until I left in 2011, as I left, we had served 1

20 million, over a million smokers had called that

quitline, one of the largest in the world.

I know you've got one here in Florida

23 We helped develop the protocols for almost all the

state quitlines that exist around the country today, including the one here in Florida where if

you call up you can get the free starter kits of nicotine patches and so on.

Q.  You assisted smokers in Buffalo at Roswell Park, and then as you've just described in New York State helped other states set up their quitlines.

Are you doing some of the same things down in Charleston that you were doing, say, up in Buffalo and in New York?

A.  Sure.  You know, South Carolina actually has a quitline, as all states do.  So that already existed when I got to Charleston.

So I focused really on our hospital, and so I've established a system within our hospital so every patient that comes in the door gets assessed for nicotine dependence.

If you're a smoker or a tobacco user, you're automatically going to be seen by a bedside counselor because it's the standard of care.

So we try to reach everybody while they're in the hospital, get them a treatment plan.  We do an assessment, try to tailor their treatment because they get enforced cessation when they're in the hospital.

You're not allowed to smoke, and we want

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=42
10 many go back to smoking.  It's about 80, 85

11 12

14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1250

to keep them off of the cigarettes, and so we follow everybody out to six months.

So, 3, 14, 30 days, you're getting a call from our service to ask about your smoking status.  If you relapse, we'll refer you right back in to the South Carolina Quitline or back to our hospital for assistance.

And we've cut the relapse rate, which is the rate at which people, once they've quit, how

percent of the people.

We never knew this until we started

13 measuring how many people actually return back to

smoking.  Here they've been in the hospital for a couple of days or maybe a week or more.

Eighty-five percent of them are back smoking again.  We've cut that to 40 percent with the bedside counselor treating them, and that has affected our re-admission rates back into the hospital from 16 percent among the group that don't get counseled to the group that does to 9 percent.

That's a big difference.  That just shows you what keeping people off of cigarettes will do.  So there's a real benefit to doing that.

So we set that up at the Medical University, and I've now taken that program and put it into four other hospitals in the Charleston area, and my goal is to get every hospital in South Carolina into the system, and now we're going to do exactly what the cigarette companies do.

We'll have a registry of smokers and we'll be able to remind them about services that are available for them to stop smoking, and these are high-risk folks because they're already in the hospital.  Many of them are in the hospital for diseases caused by smoking.

Q.  Let's talk about some of the professional organizations that you belong to.  Do you belong to the American Public Health

17 Association?

A.  I do.

Q.  And what is that?

A.  That's the professionals who get degrees in public health, so master's of public health, which is really a practitioner degree.  The Ph.D.s are really people that go on and do that for research purposes, and that's that organization. It's a huge organization.  Like the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

1 American Medical Association for doctors, the

2 American Public Health Association is for public

3 health practicers.

4      Q.  How about the Society for Research on

5 Nicotine and Tobacco, are you a member of that,

6 and what is that?

7      A.  Sure.  That's a specialized subgroup,

8 obviously, people doing research on nicotine and

9 tobacco.  It was started in 1990, and it's about

10 2,000 members currently, and they meet once a

11 year, have an annual meeting here in the United

12 States.

13           They also have chapters in a variety of

14 other countries around the world.

15      Q.  Are you a member of an organization

16 called Stop Teenagers Addiction to Tobacco or

17 STAT, S-T-A-T?

18      A.  Yes, that was an organization that

19 started up in the basically late '80s, early '90s,

20 focused on trying to highlight the problem of some

21 of the marketing that was targeting children.

22      Q.  Is it important, Dr. Cummings, to become

23 involved in the prevention of young people taking

24 up smoking?

25      A.  It is.

1253

Q.  And why is that?

A.  Because almost all people who become smokers do so during their teenage years.  Twelve to 24, is sort of the sweet spot where you see almost all uptake of smoking, and the earlier somebody smokes, the more likely it is they're going to become heavily addicted because you're affecting the brain with the drug nicotine at an early age, and it's in the developmental phase.

So we know this is true of other drugs of abuse, but it's also true for addiction.  So if you can keep people off of cigarettes early on, you can lower, you know � it's very rare to see anybody take up smoking after the age of 25.

It does happen, but it's less than five percent of smokers who report beginning their smoking careers after the age of 25, and those people find it a lot easier to quit than those who started at age 11 or 12.

Q.  What impact does nicotine have on an 11, 12, 13-year-old person's brain?

A.  Well, nicotine alters the brain.  So it actually alters the structure and function of the brain, and the earlier the brain is exposed to an addictive substance like nicotine, the greater the

structural changes during that developmental period.

So it's � we began to observe this with smokers.  You know, we do the epidemiologic studies of humans and you ask them � maybe you're 50 years old here, but you go back in time:  When did you first start to smoke and so on?

And you can reconstruct.  The fact that people who were struggling to quit as adults had started a lot earlier.

That was the early observations, but there's a lot of things that happen with teenagers, social factors, so the animal studies were the most convincing.

So you take the social aspects out and you just look at animals at different ages and then expose their brains to nicotine.

And you see the same effects.  They exhibit much stronger dependence earlier in their life cycle that they're exposed to nicotine, and, you know, you can do very sophisticated studies looking at the brain changes, either through autopsy studies or, you know, imaging kinds of studies and so on.

Q.  Are you familiar with what some of the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=47
5 What smokers tend to develop is, as you get

6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1255

changes that occur in a smoker's brain are?

A.  There's two changes basically.  You get an increase in the number of receptors.  We all naturally have receptors in our body for nicotine.

exposed to nicotine, you develop more of these receptor sites in the brain, which is why people develop a tolerance to nicotine.

In other words, they need more and more of it to get the effect.  Nobody starts out smoking a pack a day or two packs a day.  They start experimenting with cigarettes, and some go on to become regular smokers, others do not.

So there's probably genetic variation that you're getting.  In fact, we know there is, and who goes on to become a heavily addicted smoker.

But in those who are susceptible, we see these brain changes occurring, and they have more of these receptors that they grow in their brain.

Those seem to be � stay with people based on the autopsy studies and so on that have been done.

And then when nicotine hits these receptors, you stimulate a variety of

neurotransmitters.  These are hormones in the body that affect how we feel.

So dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine and so on.  You can � these may affect our mood. So dopamine is sort of a reward chemical.  So that gives us pleasure and reward, and the absence of that is not having pleasure and reward, which is what people experience when they try to quit smoking.

They get withdrawal.  They get irritable, antsy, nervous.  They feel a little depressed because they're not getting their neurotransmitters that they've become used to.

And as you need more of those neurotransmitters to feed those receptors over time, you basically � you know, people get into this smoking to avoid withdrawal as an adult addicted smoker and we call that the cycle of addiction because it's hard to get out of the cycle once you get hooked and have these changes in your brain.

Q.  You said in the answer that there are changes in the brain seen at autopsy.  So does that mean that some brain changes with respect to nicotine are permanent?

A.  Yes.  I mean we've � again, the animal studies � you can take all the social aspects out and just look at the animals and the duration of their exposures, how long they've been exposed to nicotine, and you'll see differences in their brains.

Autopsy studies obviously with people who have different histories of smoking, and now imaging, brain imaging studies is a big area to look at what aspects of the brain are affected by different addictive substances, and you can see the differences in the brains of smokers and nonsmokers.

They're clearly different because of the drug.  So this is not a psychological addiction. This is a physiological addiction.  So it's not a

17 matter of choice.

It is a matter of being addicted.  It's truly a constrained choice.  That is what addiction is.

Q.  What do you mean "constrained choice"?

A.  I mean the persons � once you become addicted to a substance, it's hard to stop using it because you physiologically need the drug, and your mood and behavior is affected by the drug,

and you're not thinking � it's not a rational choice that you can make because now you have this physiological drive or need to have the drug to feel normal.

And that's because of the brain changes as a result of exposure, repeated exposure to an addictive substance, nicotine.  As well as other drugs of abuse, cocaine, heroin, alcohol have similar effects in the brain.

Q.  You've talked to the jury about what a grant is and how much grant and contract money you've been awarded.  You mentioned the NCI.

What are some of the other organizations from which you've received grants from that have helped and formed your opinions in these matters?

A.  The American Cancer Society has funded some of my work.  Robert Wood Johnson, which is a foundation, has funded a number of grants that I've had.

I've gotten grants from various states. New York State obviously funded some of my work. I got funding from other states.  The State of

23 Massachusetts funded some of our work on the

tobacco documents, for example.

So those are some of the examples of the

places that I've gotten funding.

Q.  One of the grants I'd like to ask you about is entitled "Marketing to Youth, Evidence from Corporate Documents."

What was that grant?  What did that grant involve?

A.  Well, it's pretty obvious.  It was when the internal business records became available from the companies.  So this was in the late '90s, early 2000s, I wrote this grant to the National Cancer Institute.  It was one of the first grants I did on the documents.

It was asking a very simple question. The companies say they don't market to teenagers.

15 What do their internal business records say?  We

did a very comprehensive analysis of thousands of their internal business records from all of the companies basically to see whether their claim that they don't study the smoking habits of young people.  Is that true?

Do they engineer their products to appeal to young people?  So we looked at a variety of different elements around the marketing.  I call it the four P's, product, price, promotion, placement.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=52
21 22 23 24 25

1260

1           And whether, in fact, you could find

2 evidence that they were marketing their products

3 to young people, and so we wrote up a paper on

4 that subject and a whole issue of the journal,

5 Tobacco Control, that I was co-editor on devoted

6 to research on the internal business records that

7 looked at a whole variety of topics. Many of them focused on the topic of

9  [marketing to youth.

10      Q.  Let's talk about some publications to

11 give the jury a flavor of some of the things that

12 you've written

13           First if you could tell us what is a

14 peer-reviewed publication, please?

15      A.  Peers are people in your profession who

16 would know the topic of your � know the topic of

17 the research that you're writing on.

18           Usually, blindly, they will get your

19 paper and will be asked to make comments, if the

20 method is appropriate, are the conclusions drawn

from the findings reasonable and not overreaching the data.

Are there errors flaws in the logic and thinking in this study?  They'll write up a critique.  Usually for every paper, you'll get

three or four peer reviewers who will send back comments to an editor.

The editor is sort of the referee.  They get the comments back, and if the comments are sort of on the negative end, they usually reject your paper.

If the comments are sort of in the middle of the road and you can fix certain things, they'll come back and say:  Address these issues and we'll reconsider your paper.  And if they just love the paper outright, they get it � it gets accepted.

So this is pretty much the way almost all the scientific publications work.  They have peer reviewers.  They have editors.  Some of the larger journals have a team of editors that handle the papers.

And so it's a competitive process to get your work into the journals, and it's a way of trying to make sure that the scientific quality of the publications have merits because it's going through these sort of checks and balances.

So that's what the process is. Q.  What is Tobacco Control? A.  That's a journal that was created in the

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=54
1

2 Association, and it's a journal devoted to tobacco

early '90s.  It was put out by the British Medical

control, an international journal.

So it has a focus on tobacco control in an international context.  And so it will cover all aspects from uptake of smoking, cause � you know, relationship of cigarettes to disease, to, you know, tobacco control policies, what works, what doesn't work.

And so they publish usually I think six times a year.  I was one of the founders of the journal.  I served as the deputy editor for that journal for about eight years.

I now have gray hair and emeritus, but they usually send me papers to review too often. I usually get about, you know, a request once a

17 month or so.

I try to honor as many as I can, but there are a lot of journals that publish on tobacco issues, so that's just one of them.

Q.  You mentioned British Medical Journal is that like The New England Journal of Medicine in the United States?

A.  Yeah.  The BMJ, British Medical Journal, is like JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=55
1 Association.  So the British doctors have their

4 Association, they � their flagship is the BMJ

5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1263

publication.

When I said the British Medical

journal.  Then may have specialty journals that they do.  So they have journals on injury prevention, tobacco control.

I think they have about, if I'm guessing, the last time I checked, it was maybe 12 or 13 different specialty journals that they put out.

Q.  Now your most recent CV that I've seen, you had about 366 publications or thereabouts, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  First of all, are all of those publications peer-reviewed?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What do most of those 366 peer-reviewed publications focus on?

A.  Tobacco, you know, and various aspects from cigarette design, to marketing, to the epidemiology of how smoking relates to disease, down to, you know, micro aspects of how people smoke cigarettes.

So it covers the gamut of a lot of different topics, but most of my CV includes tobacco-related work.

Q.  Have you published on topics such as how patients and consumers perceive messages?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you published on such topics as diagnosing and treating nicotine addiction?

A.  Sure.  I've written the chapter that's used by family doctors.  I co-wrote a chapter with a family doctor at Roswell Park for a textbook that's widely used in training primary care doctors.

And the chapter we wrote was on assessing nicotine dependence and treating nicotine dependence.

Q.  When you say "primary care doctor," what do you mean?

A.  A family physician, internal medicine, primarily not a specialist like a pulmonary doctor or a medical oncologist.  Those are usually the referral types.

Even a psychiatrist is usually specialized.  They're not primary care.  So primary care is generally who we go to first and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=57
17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1265

1 if they think there's a problem there that needs

2 some special assessment, they'll refer you to the

3 specialist.

4      Q.  Why do primary care doctors need to know

5 about how to deal with nicotine addiction?

6      A.  Because that's � it's the front lines

7 of where we treat nicotine dependence.  About 70 percent of the American public sees a doctor,

9   mostly primary care doctors, every year.

10           And so it's now a required, meaningful

11 use indicator, so with electronic health records

12 and the Affordable Care Act, the doctors are all

13 being required to do some standardized

14 assessments, and tobacco is right on top

15           And the reason it's one of the

16 meaningful use indicators is because it's so

important to the health problems that primary care doctors will take care of.

So it's related to so many diseases, not just cancer, but cardiac conditions, respiratory problems, wound healing from surgeries, you know, osteoporosis, brittle bones related to smoking. There's a whole host of things.

And primary care doctors not only can assess, but they can try to treat patients who

flu, but if they're a smoker, it's a good opportunity to try to get them off of the cigarettes right then and there, and they'll work with the patients to try to treat them so they don't come back with the cancer or the heart attack down the line.

So we spend a lot of time working with primary care doctors to get them to intervene with patients to assist them to quit.

Q.  When you say you spend a lot of time, do you actually teach primary care physicians and other physicians different ways in assessing and dealing with nicotine addiction?

A.  Sure.  I mean I did that at the State University of New York at Buffalo and I currently do the same thing at the Medical University of South Carolina, and not only the primary care docs but also the specialists.

I'm in the Department of Psychiatry.  So I teach our residents how to do assessments, nicotine dependence, try to educate them about some of the treatments we have, how to make those treatments more effective and tailor them to patients individually.

have contact with smokers.

Q.  Have you also published on the topic of nicotine addiction as a cause of disease?

A.  Many articles on that topic.

Q.  And how does nicotine addiction cause disease?

A.  Well, nicotine addiction is the fundamental link between the repeated exposures to the toxins you get in every puff of a cigarette and the diseases that those toxins cause.

So there's a dose-response relationship. So the more exposure you have, the longer that exposure happens, the greater the chances of getting a disease from it like cancer.

And nicotine addiction is what explains why people keep smoking and exposing themselves to the 7,000 chemicals, 60-plus carcinogens in every puff of a cigarette over not just a day or weeks or months but years and decades.

Q.  If you took nicotine out of the cigarette, what would happen?

A.  Well, people would have a choice because people smoke for the nicotine, and if you remove

the nicotine or even lowered it to very low levels of nicotine, it wouldn't be reinforcing to the smoker, and most smokers want to quit and would quit if they could do so easily.

And so cigarettes, you know � people would stop smoking, and we'd probably still have young people experimenting because young people aren't really thinking about any of the risks when they start.

But they wouldn't go on to become addicted smokers.  So it would end the pipeline in and it would open up the drain so people could get out, and that would have a big public health benefit in this country and worldwide.

Q.  So is it fair to say that nicotine addiction is really the link between smoking and diseases like cancer?

MR. BELASIC:  Objection, leading.

THE COURT:  It is leading.  Don't lead on that question.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  One thing you mentioned early on that I didn't ask you about then because I was going to ask you about it right around now, and that is the Surgeon General or the Office of the Surgeon General, and then we're going to talk

about your contributions to the Surgeon General's report.

So if you could just tell the members of the jury, what is the Office of the Surgeon General, please?

A.  Well, the Surgeon General is appointed by the President of the United States, and he oversees the Public Health Service.

And that covers doing Public Health Service activity across all parts of our federal government.

So actually there are Surgeon Generals who are assigned for each branch of our military, as well as the, you know, current Surgeon General who oversees the entire Public Health Service.

Q.  Are there reports issued by the Surgeon General regarding topics on cigarette smoking and health?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And when was the first such report issued?

A.  Well, the first statement from the Surgeon General of the United States linking cigarette smoking to cancer was 1957.  That was Leroy Burney.

And not just linking it, saying smoking causes cancer, and the evidence was sufficient in 1957, to allow that statement.

In 1964, there was a report, an advisory report to the Surgeon General's office that usually most people think of as the first official Surgeon General's report on smoking and health.

And Luther Terry was the Surgeon General of the United States in 1964, and they put out that report, and then congress mandated that actually reports get put out on a routine basis.

After that, up until � it was almost on an annual basis until the 1990s, and then they didn't require them to do it on an annual basis.

I think there have been 34 official reports on Smoking and Health since the original '64 report.

Q.  And can you describe for us the process whereby a report gets put together and then ultimately published?

A.  Sure.  I mean the advisory report was an independent group of scientists selected because of their expertise in science, but actually there was quite a process to how they were selected to be on the advisory committee, but they were

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=63
6 members of the advisory committee.  Today I think

7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1271

esteemed scientists who didn't have � hadn't come out publicly actually as of 1964, one way or the other on the smoking and health issue.

Then the � so now the reports have extensive � there were ten, the original ten

in the last report, there were over a hundred scientists who contributed to the report that was put out, again, experts in chemistry, in epidemiology, pathology, animal studies, human smoking behavior studies, you know, aspects of health communications.

And it's peer review on steroids because you have people who contribute and write sections of the report, and then it goes through probably nowadays I would say six months to a year worth of review and editing and rewriting and review and editing.

So the conclusions that come out of these reports are, you know, rock solid in terms of, you know, the best of what we know of the science, which is what the reports are supposed to do, update us on the science, what are the findings, what do they mean, what are the implications, where are there gaps, and that's

1 what the reports do today.

2      Q.  And just so the jury gets an idea for

3 demonstrative purposes, is this the most recent

4 Surgeon General's report, the Health Consequences

5 of Smoking, 50 Years of Progress, a report of the

6 Surgeon General?

7      A.  Correct, that's the 2014 report.  So 50 years later, that's a summary of the evidence.

9   Actually, there's a whole other section which is

10 an appendix that goes with all the tables

A.  Yes, I have.

Q.  Okay.  How many and when was your first involvement?

A.  Probably about ten of the reports I've been involved in, either as a reviewer or a contributor.  So the first time was 1988.  That was a report on nicotine addiction.

I was asked to be a reviewer of a section of the report, which I did.  So, like a peer reviewer, they send you out a section, you review it, send back comments.

In '89, I was asked for the first time to write up a section of the report, which I did, and I got the peer review comments back and had to do the rewriting.

And I've done that for about ten or so reports that have come out since 1988.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, this would be a natural breaking point.

broke, we were talking about your involvement in Surgeon General's reports, and you said you'd been involved in about ten, I think you said, right?

A.  Yeah, roughly.  My guess is around ten.

Q.  Since 1988, the report on nicotine addiction, which was your first involvement when you were a reviewer, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Could you tell the jury what other roles besides reviewer you have had in those ten reports?

A.  Sure.  Well, I served as a writer of certain sections of the reports.  So I've written chapters in various reports.  The first one was 1989.  I did a chapter in 1994, another chapter in the 2014 report.

In addition, I've served as an overall reviewer.  So I've done sections of reports, but I've also � usually when they finally put the full report together.

So I did this for 2010 and 2014.  They send you the full report to review sort of in toto.  They send that usually to fairly senior folks to review and go over the major conclusions

of the report and send back comments, so sort of an overarching part.

And I've also participated with the Office on Smoking and Health in identifying topics for Surgeon General's reports.

2014 was pretty easy because it was a 50-year lookback because it was the 50th anniversary.

The 2010 report was on the mechanisms by which tobacco causes disease, and that was unique because most of the reports up to that point hadn't really looked at mechanisms of disease causation.

They had talked about it, but there hadn't been a full report really focused on the basic mechanisms, biologic mechanisms by which smoking causes disease.

So I was involved in doing that, and I helped them recruit the poor editors that they have for these reports because it's � a big chunk of your life goes into writing them.

So I've helped them identify, you know, some of the editors for their reports over the years.

Q.  And ultimately when these reports are

put together, whether it's 2014, 2012, 2010, and so on, are there major conclusions that are stated in these reports?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And, generally, what are major conclusions, and what are the import of the major conclusions of Surgeon General's reports?

A.  Well, the major conclusions are sort of the overarching what the science tells us, what we know as of today based on all of the available published scientific literature.

And they're fairly conservative conclusions; in other words, they're not overreaching the data.  They're summaries of the available scientific literature.

And usually they � there are different topics.  We'll pick out major conclusions from the different chapters and have an overarching set of

19 major conclusions usually for every report.

In '64, smoking causes lung cancer, and it warrants sufficient evidence that remedial action is necessary.  That was one of the major conclusions in the '64 report.

And they didn't specify what those actions would be, but they concluded that the

science warranted that something needed to be done about the smoking problem in the United States because it was causing people to die prematurely as a result of their exposure to the chemicals and such in tobacco.

Q.  What was the topic of the � the main topic of the 2012 Surgeon General's report?

A.  That was on smoking and youth.  So it was really an update of the '94 report, which also dealt with smoking and youth.

So a few years later, basically they do an update because it's so important.  The uptake rates sort of dictate what the disease patterns are going to be 20, 30, 40 years down the line.

Q.  So even as recently as 2012, is youth smoking still a big issue?

A. It's a huge issue because almost all people who take up smoking do so during their adolescent years, as I said, 12 to 24.

And even though we've had great success, I think we've lowered smoking rates to the lowest levels they've been since they've started really tracking rates nationally in this country.

So that's a good success story, and they started to fall dramatically after 2000 as

information came out about � from the internal business records really, is what happened.

And that's now been communicated to young people, and thankfully fewer and fewer young people are taking up smoking.

But we still see a fair number of young people today smoke because adolescents will do things that aren't always the brightest in the world and think they � nobody is thinking they're getting addicted or will get sick.  Nobody ever thinks it will happen to them.

Q.  How many smokers are there currently in the United States of America?

A.  Current estimate is about 42 million.

Q.  Have you been � you talked about just generally some publications, your work on Surgeon General's reports.  Do you also act as a reviewer for other journals?  We showed Tobacco Control, for example.

A.  Sure.  I review for many other journals. I've served on the editorial board for a number of journals, so JAMA, British Medical Journal.

I do reviews for Lancet, the journal

Biomarkers.

These are sort of some of the journals that I've been involved with in terms of either as a reviewer or on their editorial board.

Q.  What is the Centers for Disease Control? A.  That's part of our federal government that sort of tracks disease patterns, outbreaks, like Ebola, for example.

They're involved with that.  They also have � the Office on Smoking and Health is currently under the auspices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention today.

Q.  Have you provided any services for the CDC?

A.  Sure.  I'm a consultant to the Office on Smoking and Health, have been so for a number of years.

They put out the Surgeon General's reports, but they also fund state quitlines, for example.

They do the tracking studies that � these are the big surveys that are done of adolescents to see what the smoking rates are.

They do similar surveys of adults.  So I advise them about those studies, how to interpret

findings, what new products are coming out, how to assess those new products to see if those are going to be issues that you need to be paying attention to in terms of public health problems down the line.

Q.  How about state governments around the United States, have you provided or do you provide services to state governments?

A.  Well, New York State obviously.  Roswell Park was a division of the New York State Health Department.  So I was actually a Health Department employee.

They privatized at the end of the '90s, but basically I was in public health practice almost all my career, and then I've done consultation work for the State Department of Health in not only New York but California.

I co-chair, and still do and have since the 1990s, their external advisory committee that they have that oversees the California Tobacco Control Program.

I do the same thing in Louisiana, and now I serve on the board of the Tobacco-Free Collaborative in South Carolina.

publications, you mentioned the term "monograph."

A.  It's like a Surgeon General's report. So there are compilations of chapters.  You recruit authors.  You go through a peer-review process and put them out.

And the National Cancer Institute has had a series of monographs they've done on tobacco, I think 21 at this point, and I've served both as a contributor, a reviewer, and an editor of some of the reports.

I was the editor of their report on cigars, which I think was Monograph 9; and, you know, as I mentioned, I think I mentioned the word "monograph."

I've done a couple for the World Health Organization, a group called the International Research Agency on Cancer.

They put out basically monographs on the things that cause cancer and various ways to

21 mitigate cancer.

And we did one on tobacco-related issues for them in 2007.  I was an editor of that report, and I'm doing one now that's in the works for WHO on product regulation.  It should come out next

year.

Q.  In addition to United States state governments, have you provided consulting services to other nations and their public health officials?

A.  Yes.  My current research is international.  We have studies in the U.S. and have been tracking smokers.

The current wave of cohort studies in the United States have � I think we started in 2002, and we're in the field now surveying the same smokers that we started with in 2002 here, but we have studies in 23 other countries.

So that tobacco lab, we gather cigarettes in other countries as well and compare them and have published a number of papers on the cigarettes as well as the smoking habits of smokers.

And we do reports on the effects of what governments are doing to try to inform their populations about the health risks of smoking and what policies are working and not working and produce reports.

And members of our team, as well as

25 myself, have provided not only reports but

testimony to health ministries all over the world.

Q.  What's the World Health Organization?

A.  That's, you know, a division of the United Nations and its member countries that focuses on issues related to health, so global health issues.

Q.  Now, Dr. Cummings, because of your experience and qualifications that we've just spent a fairly good amount of time going over, do you find yourself in court testifying about smoking and health issues often?

A.  Yes.

Q.  For how long or for what period of time have you been lending your expertise in court?

A.  The first time I ever did this, I had done an Institute of Medicine report � I think that's how my name sort of came out � which was on youth and smoking.

And I was asked to be involved in court cases from the state Attorney Generals, and I agreed to do that.  That was 1996.

Then I got involved here in Florida with the original Engle case.  I testified twice in that case pro bono, thought it would be done, and

MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor. Beyond the scope.  Prejudicial.

THE COURT:  All right.  I think he answered the question.  I'll let the answer stand.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  How many times have you testified in post-Engle or Engle progeny cases?

A.  I've probably done 80 trials.  I've probably been deposed over 120 times, I suspect, if not more.  I don't count them.  I mean it's too

13 much to count, but a lot.  I think � it's been a

lot of cases.  About 80 trials.

Q. Do you also testify outside of the State of Florida, or have you also testified outside of the State of Florida, I should ask?

A.  Sure.  I've testified in Illinois, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, California, Louisiana, Missouri, West Virginia.  So � I'm involved in a case in Uruguay.

Q.  You referenced your experience testifying in Engle progeny cases.  Is that across the State of Florida?

A.  Yes.

mentione

And that went on for 11 hours, over two days, and then I traveled here.  So that pretty

A.  Yes.

Q.  And what is that organization, and what was the nature of that award?

A.  Well, that's another, you know, professional group.  They focus on areas of cancer prevention, so, you know, diet, early detection, tobacco.

Joe Cullen was the director of the Tobacco Research Program at the National Cancer Institute in the 1980s and died from a brain tumor, and they named an award after him, and I received that award in his name in 2003.

Q.  Have you been the recipient of the 2009 John Slade Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Public Health and Tobacco Control for Science and Basic Public Policy and Public Advocacy from the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco?

A.  Yep, that's another one.  John Slade was probably one of the early pioneers of understanding cigarette design and nicotine

addiction, and, you know, he passed away, and they named an award for him I think around 2005.

So I received the award in 2007 in his name, which they give out every year at their annual meeting, which is quite an honor.  I knew Dr. Slade pretty well.

Q.  And, finally, have you been the recipient of the 2009 Luther L. Terry Award for Outstanding Research and Contribution in Tobacco Control from the American Cancer Society?

A.  I have.

Q.  And if you could tell us, who is Luther Terry, and what was that award?

A.  Sure.  This is � they do this at the

15 World Conference on Smoking and Health, which is a

conference held every three years.

And Luther Terry was the Surgeon General of the United States in 1964, and the American Cancer Society gives out an award � it's probably the top award in my field � every three years, and I received their award in 2009.

So if you're around long enough, write enough papers I guess, they start handing out awards, but that was quite an honor to get that.

And I am on the selection committee for

3      Q.  Okay.  Thank you, Dr. Cummings, for

4 spending some time introducing yourself and your

5 qualifications to the jury.

6           Let's transition, as I alluded to a

7 moment ago, into the first topics that we

8 previewed for the jury, and that is nicotine

9 addiction in general and then specifically

10 nicotine addiction as it pertains to Mary Cooper,

11 okay?

12      A.  Okay.

13      Q.  So just kind of as a road map, we'll

14 first talk about nicotine addiction in general,

15 and then we'll talk about Mary Cooper

16 specifically, okay?

17      A.  That's fine.

18      Q.  Before we started talking about some of

19 your awards, I asked you how many hours that you

20 spent in the case, and you talked to us about

21 reviewing some depositions and going � undergoing

22 a deposition and everything.

23           But let's talk about specifically what

24 you've reviewed to help you form your opinion

25 regarding Mary Cooper's addiction, okay?

3 case-specific materials you have reviewed that

4 will enable you to talk about and give opinions

5 about Ms. Cooper?

6      A.  Sure.  I mean I reviewed � I was sent

7 by plaintiffs deposition transcripts from Mary Cooper and her daughter and grandchildren,

9   Mr. Robert Aaron, former husband, actually two

10 former husbands, Larry Hollingsworth, and Charles

11 Bray, stepsister, stepbrother, and then five of

12 her treating physicians

13           So I think in total it was about 23

14 depositions, volumes that I reviewed.  And then I

15 was also sent medical records.  I was sent �

16 actually the defendants had an expert who

17 interviewed Ms. Cooper, and I was sent the

18 transcripts from that interview

19           I also had an opportunity to speak with

20 Ms. Cooper for about an hour, you know, phone

interview, and so that's � there were interrogatories.  There was a lot of written

23 material in advance.

I reviewed the depositions from family

25 members and medical records, and then I did my

interview with Ms. Cooper, and I summarized those in some notes that I prepared, and that was the basis for the questioning in the deposition that I did in this case.

Q. How long � you referenced you made some notes, you wrote � you made notes or you wrote a report.  How many pages was that?

A.  It's about 40 pages long, and, you know, they just summarize some of the key facts.  There were a lot of people in the case and a number of volumes.

I think Ms. Cooper, I reviewed three volumes of her deposition that she gave, and so the notes are not required, but I write them just so when I'm doing question and answer, I have them for my reference.

I bring them here to court as well, but it's the same notes that I had when I was deposed.

Q. Now you said that you had an opportunity to speak with Ms. Cooper, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Now let's � I want to talk about that in two ways.  First of all, let's talk � before we talk about Ms. Cooper, let's talk about: Generally when you assess � well, let me ask you

this:  How many smokers have you assessed in your career for nicotine addiction?

A.  Personally, you know, actually face to face, probably about 10,000.  You know, everybody used to come to my smoking clinics.  We would do an assessment.  I ran those clinics.

And then when I set up the Smokers Quitline � of course I've done some counseling on the quitline myself, but mostly I had staff who were doing that that I trained.

And then with the medical university program with our hospital bedside counselor program, again, I set up the protocols.

I've done some of the counseling myself, but mostly we have the person I hired doing that bedside counseling.

So I'd say 10,000 face to face personally I've done, and then I've been involved in reaching many more smokers through the programs that I've set up.

Q.  On average, how long in assessing those face-to-face patients might you spend talking to a patient?

A.  In the hospital?  You're lucky if you get ten minutes when you walk in.  You know,

you've got to get right down to it.

Even on the phone, you're not going to hold somebody on the phone for an hour, although some people like to talk on the phone, but you've got lots of phones.  You know, it's a busy quitline.

So you've got to get it done in about 10 to 15 minutes to do an assessment, develop a treatment plan, and provide recommendations for what that patient ought to be doing.

Q.  In your experience, is that a sufficient amount of time to get an understanding of whether that smoker is dependent or addicted, has a problem with smoking?

A.  More than sufficient.  You know, primary care doctors, they're lucky if they can get three

17 minutes to do it.

And, in fact, the way the reimbursement is done these days, if you get ten minutes, that's considered intense intervention, so ten minutes or

21 more.

Three to ten is sort of the standard of care in primary care, and so the tools that we've developed for doing assessments and triaging patients to tailor their therapy have to be, you

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

1 know, brief because these are busy � you know, in

2 a clinical setting, you've got other issues you're

3 dealing with, and you've got to do it quickly.

4           But there are good tools to do

5 assessments, and I utilized some of those tools

6 when I interviewed Ms. Cooper.

7      Q.  With respect to � well, let me ask you this:  How long were you able to speak with

9  |Ms. Cooper?

10      A.  I had an hour with her on the phone.  So

11 that is a lot longer, plus I had all the

12 background material available, including, you

13 know, interviews or depositions that had been done

14 of her treating doctors and her own questioning

15           As I said, she was questioned over a

16 number of days, and so I had all of that

17 background material, plus the documents, the

18 medical records that were sent to me.

So, as I said, this was extensive the amount � I mean I had 30 hours of stuff before I even got on the phone with Mary Cooper to interview her.

So it was really just clarifying a few questions on the phone to go through and do the interviews with her.

Q.  And did you even consider the written report of the defense psychiatrist?

A.  I did.

Q.  Based upon all of the information that you reviewed � well, let me ask you this:  Do you think you have sufficient information to formulate an opinion as to whether Ms. Cooper was addicted or � addicted to nicotine in cigarettes?

A.  Absolutely no doubt.

Q.  Of course, as I said, as soon as I say it, I kind of asked a few other questions.  I said we were going to start talking generally about nicotine and then specifically about Ms. Cooper and your opinions.

But let me just ask you this generally: Based upon your education, training, experience, and review of the case-specific materials, do you have an opinion as to whether or not Mary Cooper was addicted to nicotine in cigarettes?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  And as we go along, are you going to share with the jury the reasons why?

A.  Yes, I will.

Q.  Okay.  Let's start with nicotine, Dr. Cummings.  Is nicotine a drug?

Q.  Were you involved in the 1988 Surgeon General's report?

A.  Yes, I was, a reviewer.

Q.  I'm sorry?

A.  I was a reviewer of that report.

Q.  That's right.

And if you could remind us what the topic of that report was, please.

A.  Well, the topic was really why people smoke, and the title of the report is "Nicotine

17 Addiction"

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we would offer PT3828, which is the 1988 Surgeon General's report, into evidence.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm assuming these are already all marked, right, unless there's something separate that you will tell me there's an objection.

in, but I'll put it in subject to later redactions and revisits with the lawyers.  Okay?

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT3828 was received in evidence.)

MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  What were the major conclusions � actually if we could publish one of the � which is PDR140, which is an excerpt from the 1988 Surgeon General's report, please.

Oh, there it is up there.  I was looking there.  Sorry.

Dr. Cummings, who is that on the left?

A.  That's Dr. C Everett Koop.  He was the Surgeon General in 1988.  Actually he was Surgeon General from 1982 until 1990.

Q.  And we have there to the right of Dr. Koop the title and cover page of the 1988 Surgeon General's report, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And what were the major conclusions of the 1988 Surgeon General's report?

A.  They're right there on the screen. Those were the three main conclusions:  Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting.

Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=92
1300

1 causes addiction.

2           And the pharmacologic and behavioral

3 processes that determine tobacco addiction are

4 similar to those that determine addiction to drugs

5 such as heroin and cocaine.

6      Q.  The term "pharmacologic," what does that

7 mean?

8      A.  They're talking about the physiological

9 effects of the drug, a drug on the human body.

10 Really they're talking about the effects not only

11 on the human body but, you know, specifically on

12 the brain.

13      Q.  In what way, Dr. Cummings, are the

14 pharmacologic effects of nicotine similar to

15 heroin and cocaine?

16      A.  Well, heroin and cocaine are drugs of

17 abuse also.  They're addictive drugs, and they

18 have pharmacologic effects on the brain, and they

19 alter the structure and function of the brain,

20 affecting receptor sites in the brain, as well as

21 the release of neurotransmitters.

22           And some of the same locations in the

23 brain where we see the effects of drugs like

24 heroin and cocaine are the same sites that are

25 related to the effects of nicotine, and so that's

what they're talking about.

Q.  Is there a uniform definition of addiction?

A.  Sure.  Well, there are a lot of different definitions that people have used, but the National Institutes on Drug Abuse has a definition that people use of addiction, addiction to various drugs.

And they talk about it as a chronic relapsing brain disease that's characterized by compulsive use and drug seeking in spite of knowledge of harmful consequences.

So the hallmarks are continued use of a drug despite the fact that you might know that that drug is causing problems for you health-wise and that it's a brain disease.

They're talking about the effects of the drug, not just psychologically, but this is actually physiologically changing the brain, as I've described to you before.

And it's a compulsive use.  So it's not just occasional use here or there, but we're talking about persistent use of the drug and needing the drug for compulsive use.

So for cigarette smoking, compulsive use

is persistent daily use of a drug.  That's the first thing I always ask people:  Do you use cigarettes every day?  And:  How long have you been doing it?

Q.  And, Dr. Cummings, I should have asked, I should have referenced, do we have a demonstrative that shows the NIDA definition of addiction that you just referenced?

A.  We do.

Q.  Okay.  Is that PDR155?

A.  Correct.

Q.  If we could publish that, please. There it is.

And that's what you just told us, right, Dr. Cummings?  From NIDA, addiction is defined as a chronic relapsing brain disease that is characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use, despite harmful consequences?

A.  That's right.

Q.  "Chronic relapsing," what does that

21 mean?

A.  Well, chronic is it's not one time. It's done repeatedly over time, and relapsing brain disease is, you know, with the drugs of abuse, people, you know, try to get off of the

drug, and then they relapse back to using it.

And you see this on a repeated basis. So it's like you have bouts of remission and then the disease reappears.

So with somebody who has a drug problem, it's common to see them try to refrain from using the drug and then relapse back to using it on a persistent basis.

And usually with drugs � somebody who is severely addicted, the quit attempts are of relatively short duration, particularly with smoking.

Heavy smokers often don't make it a day with staying off cigarettes, and it's an indication to somebody who is treating addiction, who has been doing it for years, like myself, that that person is heavily addicted, and, it's a brain disease because we can show the effects in the brain.

Some of those effects are permanent changes.  So this is not a habit.  This is a drug reinforced behavior.

And so, you know, habits, we all have habits.  We brush our teeth.  We pick out our clothes every day.  We pick out which cereal we're

going to eat in the morning or whatever.

You know, we have a choice about those things, and some of them are repetitive.

MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, I object to the narrative.

THE COURT:  What was the pending question, Mr. Bass?  Do you know?

MR. BASS:  I was asking Dr. Cummings about the definition of � that we were reading on the board, and I asked him about chronic relapsing.  He was explaining the next portion.

THE COURT:  I'll let you finish your answers.  Try to keep your answers direct to the question.

So you may proceed.

THE WITNESS: So habits are different than drug addictions. Drug addictions are drug reinforced behaviors, and they cause changes in the brain which is what I was referring to.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  "Characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use," what does that mean?

A.  If people have to use it � obviously some drugs are illegal � people will do things compulsively to get the drug.

12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1305

I think that's what a lot of people think of with illegal drugs, but with legal drugs where they're usually available and accessible, compulsive use is the fact that you have to use it every day, as I said, persistent daily use, when you ask people how much they're using and the pattern of their use, which relates directly to the pharmacologic effect of the drug in their body.

Nicotine has a very short half-life.

finished a cigarette, the nicotine levels, which have peaked, are plummeting in the person's system.

And really addicted smokers smoke almost like on a clock, every 30, 40 minutes throughout the waking hours of the day.  And if they can't smoke, they begin to get that hankering feeling in the pit of their stomach.

And if they extend that a little longer, they begin to experience withdrawal even within a couple of hours after they stop using the drug.

And then when they light up and have that cigarette, a couple of puffs, all those bad feelings go away because they get the reinforcing

dopamine in their brain.

And that's the cycle that people get in. They smoke to avoid withdrawal.  And that's true of other drugs of abuse, by the way.

Q.  Why is it?  Why is it that, like you said, an addicted smoker, it's almost like they're smoking on a clock every 30 to 40 minutes or however long you said?

A.  Well, we're talking about the pharmacokinetics of the drug, and nicotine, you can get nicotine in a lot of ways.

Nicotine can come in a patch or in smoke, aerosolized.  If it's aerosolized, it gets into the lungs, a large surface area, hits the brain right away within about eight to ten seconds.  The patch, two hours.

Speed of delivery is a key hallmark of drugs of abuse, and cocaine is addictive, but crack cocaine is more addictive because you're aerosolizing the drug.

And so the drug delivery system makes a difference, but the nicotine in cigarette smoke is highly addictive because it's an aerosolized delivery of nicotine that gives you rapid reinforcement of the effect of that drug in your

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=99
1307

brain, and it lasts about � as I said, about 20 to 30 minutes.

There is individual variation in drug

4 metabolism that relates to people's genetics,

5 which probably accounts for why some people find

6 it harder to stop smoking than others.

7           And so you look at � we are actually

8 doing studies now on the differences in individual

9 metabolism of nicotine to see how it relates to

10 strength of nicotine dependence in somebody.

11      Q.  I'm going to butcher this word, I think.

12 Is aerosolization � is that a word?

13      A.  Aerosolizing.

14      Q.  Aerosolizing.  Okay.

15           What was aerosolizing a drug � how does

16 aerosolizing a drug impact addiction?

17      A.  It's very simple.  I mean you can �

18 your lungs are a large surface area.  Let me

19 describe it this way:  Your mouth, if you just

20 hold the smoke in your mouth and you don't inhale

21 it into your lungs, your mouth has the surface

22 area roughly of a tennis ball.

23           Okay.  So that's the surface by which

24 the drug will interact with tissues and nicotine

25 would be absorbed.

Most cigar smokers, if they've never smoked a cigarette, they hold the smoke in their

of the smoke is hard to inhale.  It's a high pH. So it's makes it hard to actually inhale the smoke.

Cigarette smoke, cigarettes are engineered to make it easy to inhale into the lungs, and your lungs are the size � if we take your lungs out and roll them out on the floor, basically the surface area is about the size of a tennis court.

So it's a lot bigger area and a lot � you know, if you can get the smoke deep into the airways, you're getting the nicotine interacting with the blood vessels, and it gets absorbed rapidly and then will be in the blood and hit the brain, as I said, in about eight to ten seconds.

Mouth absorption, you know, about 20

20 minutes.  That's why the nicotine gum and lozenge,

they don't work so well.  They're not as highly addictive either because the absorption of the nicotine is pretty much through the lining of the

2 4 mouth.

nicotine patch, you're talking two hours to get the nicotine absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream.

Of course you're supposed to wear the patch 24 hours.  So now you get a steady level of nicotine rather than the rapid bolus effect you get from a cigarette.

The reward comes from the peak.  It comes from the rapid delivery of the nicotine, which is why cigarettes are a lot more reinforcing, why a lot of people say they enjoy smoking, because they get that rapid hit, that satisfaction.

That's the nicotine hitting the brain, releasing those neurotransmitters in the brain. Q.  Why is the speed of delivery important regarding nicotine addiction?

A.  Well, I mean it relates to reinforcement.  So it's the � the speed of delivery relates directly to the satisfaction somebody gets from using the drug.

And it makes the drug a lot more addictive if you can get it into your brain rapidly, which is, you know � you just don't put heroin on your skin.  You inject it.

Cigarettes, you aerosolize it, rapidly deliver it.  And, you know, a lot of drugs, just to get it in your system rapidly, somebody has asthma, can't open up their airways, give it to them in an inhaler.

You do that because you need to get that drug effect right away, otherwise, the person is going to die because they're not going to get the oxygen.  Same idea with aerosolizing other drugs, drugs that are medicines.

The problem with cigarettes, the nicotine comes with 7,000 other chemicals.  Many of them are toxins that cause cancer.

Q.  So when a drug is aerosolized, it gets to the brain even quicker than being injected?

A.  Yes, it does, which is one of the hard problems you have actually with animal studies because it's hard to give them the drug in the same way that a smoker gets it, because it's hard to get animals to inhale smoke.

You put a little mask over it and force the smoke in.  Actually it's quite aversive.  So they have pellets of food with nicotine.  They have intravenous delivery of nicotine directly into the brain, are some of the studies that they

do.

Those are sort of the neuroscience studies that go on in this field, and that's not only true of nicotine but other drugs as well. Cocaine and heroin are examined in this similar way.

Q.  How do cigarettes aerosolize smoke? A.  Well, you're burning, you know, the tobacco, and nicotine gets transferred from the tobacco when it's burned into an aerosol and is inhaled into the airway.

And if you can make the smoke so it's not so harsh and irritating by adding flavorings or other additives to make it easy to inhale, then you've got a product that's going to be highly addictive, and that's what cigarettes are.

And over time, they perfected that

18 methodology through the process of blending, the

use of additives, and other engineering features of the product, like filtration.

Q.  Why does inhalability of a cigarette impact addiction?

A.  Because it affects directly the speed by which nicotine gets to the brain.

Q.  As a nicotine delivery device, how do

cigarettes compare � you mentioned cigars a few times.  How does a cigarette compare to a cigar?

A.  Well, a cigar is loaded with nicotine. You compare a cigarette to a cigar, you'll have seven times more nicotine in a cigar; but because a cigar tends to have a higher pH, it's very harsh and hard to inhale.

And so somebody that just smokes cigars and doesn't smoke cigarettes, a lot of times they'll just smoke cigars on special occasions, they won't have that persistent daily use because they're not inhaling it directly into their lungs. They hold the smoke pretty much in their mouth.

Cigarette smokers who may also smoke cigars, they tend to inhale the cigar smoke because they learned that the nicotine effect is better.

Now they're not thinking about: Well, I'm going to inhale it because I've learned that it's getting � the effect is going to be better.

But subconsciously they will actually inhale the smoke into their airways even though it's a little aversive with cigar smoke because they get the nicotine hit at the other end because they're smoking for nicotine.

Q.  What is pH?

A.  pH is a measure of something that's acidic to basic.  So, you know, fruit juice and so on or battery acid is on the acidic end.

And then you have, on the basic end, baking soda and so on, and it's a scale that we use that goes from 0 to 14.

Our saliva or water is in the midpoint. It's 7. So neutral. Cigarette smoke is slightly acidic, around 5 and a half to 6 and a half.

And altering the pH through blending, through a filter, through various additives, if you can just bump it up, it changes the form of nicotine that people that get from a bound form to what they call an unprotonated or unbound or free nicotine, so like free-basing a drug.

And if you can bump it up slightly to around the 6.5 level, that affects how people inhale the smoke.

So you can actually make cigarette smoke very high pH.  We wouldn't see a lot of disease because people wouldn't inhale the stuff into their lungs.  They might get oral cancer, but they wouldn't actually pull it down deeply into their body.

If you had it highly acidic, people
	

would find that aversive as well.  And early
	

cigarettes around the turn of the century, the
	

turn of the 20th century, single blend, a lot of
	

them didn't have a lot of nicotine in it, or if
	

they had too much nicotine, they were pretty high
	

pH, pretty aversive.
	

It wasn't until they blended the
	

products together, the different types of tobacco
	

that were cured in special ways that altered pH
	

that made it inhalable.
	

And when they did that, cigarette sales
	

took off.  About 15 to 20 years later, we saw a
	

rapid rise in lung cancer.

things you said about this discussion about cigarettes aerosolizing, addicted smokers smoke almost as if on a clock, but if they've gone too long, then withdrawals start to occur.

A.  Correct.

Q.  What did you mean by that?

A.  Well, they begin to notice the opposite of what you get with those neurotransmitters, which is dopamine and sort of the pleasure chemical.

Serotonin sort of helps modulate our

stressed, it sort of relaxes you.

Nicotine is a stimulant, so it sort of stimulates you.  It helps you with concentration.

So when people refrain, addicted smokers refrain from getting nicotine, they get � they're not getting rewards.

So it's sort of the opposite of rewards. There's a little bit of mild depression.  They're not modulating their mood very well.  So they get nervous and antsy and sort of often lash out at others, can't control their emotions as well. They're not as alert, the lack of concentration.

So those are some of the withdrawal

effects.  Gaining weight is also another effect that you see because the effect of nicotine on those neurotransmitters also affects our hunger sensations and so on.

And often people will eat more right after they quit smoking, and they gain weight as a result of that, which is often a complaint that people have around quitting smoking, and that's another withdrawal.

It affects our sleeping patterns, so lack of sleep, which sort of just sort of folds into making it miserable.

When a lot of people quit smoking, they don't find it like:  Oh, I'm breathing better, and I'm feeling so much better.

It usually takes a few weeks to notice the benefits, and you have to get through that withdrawal period.

Q.  But withdrawals can occur notwithstanding trying to quit?  There is withdrawals when someone is trying to affirmatively abstain from smoking, right? A.  That's right.

Q.  But there's even withdrawals if a smoker who is still smoking has gone a little bit too

long without a cigarette, right?

A. Sure. We put people in our hospital, and they're not allowed to smoke. Some people find it very difficult there.

And, again, we do an assessment automatically and put a lot of people on a nicotine patch just as a standard if they're really heavy smokers when they come in.

A lot of times you do that because a lot of the symptoms of withdrawal sort of overlap with people not feeling well, and you want to be able to treat their disease.  So you really have to get an accurate view of what's going on with their symptoms.

So � but that's directly related to the fact that even somebody who has come in in a car accident or whatever and gets put in the hospital, if they're a heavy smoker, just to notice their experience, we might automatically just put them on a nicotine patch.

Q.  Are nicotine patches also known as nicotine replacement therapy?

A.  Yes.

Q. And are those designed for people who are addicted to nicotine?

A.  Yes.

Q.  When did nicotine patches come on to the

A.  The first prescription patch, the Band-Aid type thing, was '92, and there was a gum that came out in '84, also prescription.  So the nicotine gum was in 1984.  The patch was '92.

Both the patch and the gum became over the counter in 1996, and then a little later they developed lozenges, an inhaler, a little puffer device, which is giving mostly mouth delivery, not lung delivery of nicotine.

And they even have a nasal spray.  The nasal spray actually delivers the nicotine more rapidly into the airways. Q.  And why is that?

A.  Because you're spraying it like a nose spray directly into your upper air passages.

The problem with that is a lot of people don't want to use the nasal spray.  Every time you want to have a cigarette, you sort of hit the nasal spray, and it's irritating.

Nicotine is actually an irritant, and so, you know, people who have sensitive nasal passages will notice that irritation from the

nicotine.

And then it has a higher abuse liability.  So it's only available on prescription, not over the counter, because with the nicotine delivery in the upper respiratory passage, the FDA determined that it has a higher likelihood of people becoming addicted to that medicine.  So they only allow its use under a doctor's order.

Q.  And we've talked a little bit about � you've explained how a cigarette gets nicotine into the lungs and into the brain quickly, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  We've touched on nicotine receptors or nicotinic receptors, and I want to ask you if you've brought along a demonstrative called Nicotine Receptors in the Brain that might assist you in explaining what happens once the nicotine gets into the smoker's brain?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Okay.  And that is PDR156, if we can publish that.

Okay.  Dr. Cummings, if you could tell us what you're looking at?

A.  Well, these are looking � this is

obviously a cross section of the brain, and it's just highlighting the fact that nicotine affects certain parts of the brain.

And we � now science has identified these nicotinic receptors.  They call them nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.

And neurons, the cells in the brain, communicate with each other, and they do that communication through the release of various neurotransmitters which are these chemicals like dopamine, serotonin, and so on.

And a lot of things can stimulate these chemicals, and it's normal to have that.  What happens, however, is these receptor sites which exist in our brains, smokers, particularly if they start smoking at an early age and do it on a persistent basis, develop more of these receptor sites for nicotine.

And they develop a tolerance to the drug.  So they need more of the drug to get the effect of the drug.

So that's, you know � this is just showing you the nicotine binding sites or receptor sites in the brain, and they happen right in the reward center of the brain.

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=113

11 more of the nicotine.

12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1321

So we're now learning in the brain you sort of have sections that are more executive function part of the brain where we make decisions and rationally process information, and then we have the impulse centers of the brain that are related to reward.

And it's really within this reward center of the brain where drugs of abuse like nicotine alter the brain.  You get more of these receptors.  Then you need to feed the receptors

And people get to have to smoke not just a cigarette here or there but every day, a pack a day, two packs a day in order to feel like they're normal.

And then the absence of feeding those receptors results in withdrawal and then this chronic cycle of smoking to avoid withdrawal, which is true of a lot of drugs of abuse.

And one of the main withdrawal symptoms is the need to smoke, craving, urge to smoke which for many people even after they quit smoking, they notice they still have an urge to smoke because it's a learned, over learned behavior.

And these receptor sites and part of the

essentially.  You get the learning imprinting in the brain.

So it's hard to unlearn the smoking cues and a lot of things in our environment that sort of stimulate the urge to smoke, seeing somebody else light up, the phone ringing, all the patterns that were related to getting the reward from the drug when you were smoking.

Q.  You used the term � well, first of all, of course this is a demonstrative.  So it's not necessarily to scale of the brain and the nicotinic receptors, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Are there a lot of � in a smoker, are there generally a lot of nicotinic receptors?

A.  Yes, there are many more in the smoker, in the brains of smokers than there are in the brains of nonsmokers, and it relates to age of initiation as well as duration smoked.

So the earlier you start � in an animal, you can take all the � as I said, you can do the animal studies, which you can feed them the nicotine.

You can do it at different ages and then

compare the brains, and literally they'll take a slice of the brain and look at them under a

sites, and you can see them.

And, as I've said, they've done autopsy studies of humans.  You know, there, you don't get to control the dose.  You just know the history of the smoker.

And then the brain scanning studies where they put you through a brain scanner and they can light up parts of your brain, and the brains of smokers are different than the brains of nonsmokers.

Q.  You said � you used terms like "learned behavior," "reward center," "imprinting in the brain."  What did you mean by that?

A.  Well, you know, this communication of these neurons in the brain.  They're talking to each other, and they � you know, basically you learn every time you puff on a cigarette, it's giving you a reward, just like, you know, growing up.

You know, if you did something good, your parents would sort of reward you.  If you did something bad, you get the sort of punishment.

And you sort of learn that doing more of the good things, you get better reward.  The same is happening with the smoker and their exposure to nicotine.  They learn that they feel better, they avoid withdrawal, and that becomes associated with things in their daily routine.

So, you know, it's � the phone rings. A lot of people would smoke when they were on the phone.  So the whole association of the phone ringing stimulates the urge to smoke because it's been learned as an association that's related to the reward.

That's really the model, sort of an operant conditioning model for smoking behavior or other drugs of abuse, and understanding and exploiting that model is what the cigarette companies did.

Q.  What happens � you told us nicotine hits the receptors, binds � hits the brain, binds to the receptors, and then neurotransmitters are released?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Okay.  What's a neurotransmitter?

A.  Well, these are these hormones, you know, chemicals in the brain that affect how we

feel.

So I mentioned dopamine.  That's the pleasure chemical.  It affects � makes you feel good and affects also appetite.  So it has an appetite suppressant effect.

The serotonin is another type of neurotransmitter.  I brought along a demonstrative that included a variety of these

neurotransmitters.  There are � you know, eight or nine are the key neurotransmitters that are related to nicotine in the brain.

Q.  And I think that's PDR143?

A.  Correct.

Q.  If you could publish that.

Is this what you're referring to, Dr. Cummings?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And if you could tell us what we're looking at, please?

A.  Well, those are just a list of some of the neurotransmitters related to nicotine and the effects of nicotine stimulating these chemicals in the brain.

Epinephrine and norepinephrine affect our arousal and appetite suppression.

Acetylcholine, arousal and cognitive enhancement.

Vasopressin, a memory improvement.

So this is why when people, when they stop smoking they can't concentrate.

You have B-endorphins, a mood modulation that actually has some analgesic effects on pain. Actually smokers, when they're smoking and getting access to nicotine, can tolerate pain a little bit better, and they notice that they can't tolerate it as well when they quit.

And so that's � these are these chemicals that are released, and they help communicate between neurons and the cell, and the cells in the brain, and this happens every time you take a puff on a cigarette essentially and get the nicotine.

And if you get a smoke without nicotine, you don't get the release of all these chemicals, and you begin to feel the opposite of these effects, which I've described as withdrawal. Q.  So nicotine is the key ingredient?

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Is nicotine, based upon your education, training, and experience, the fundamental reason why people smoke?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Do you have an opinion as to whether smokers would continue to smoke cigarettes without nicotine?

A.  They would not.

Q.  What do you base that opinion on?

A.  I base it on my own research.  I've done studies with nicotine-free cigarettes or very low-nicotine cigarettes in smokers as a way to help them quit.

So that's my research, and there's extensive business records internally from the tobacco companies dating back decades where they did the same studies, where they removed the nicotine from their product and then looked at the effects on consumer behavior.

And their conclusions are the same, that people would not sustain continued repeated use of cigarettes if they took the nicotine out.

Q.  You said that � you're talking about � well, we've been talking about this process and what occurs when somebody takes a puff on a

cigarette, and that's what we've been talking about, right, the process of one puff on a cigarette when nicotine gets into the body, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  How many � are you familiar with how

cigarette?

A.  On average, it's about ten puffs on a cigarette.  Obviously there's individual variation, and some cigarettes are longer than others.

So if you're smoking 100s rather than, you know, an 85 millimeter cigarette, you're getting a few extra puffs.

Q. And when we talk about 85 millimeter and 100 millimeter, it sounds like a length, but what are we talking about?

A.  Well, cigarettes come in different sizes.  Unfiltered cigarettes are generally 70

20 millimeters, the short, little, stubby cigarettes.

And then the standard cigarette, a regular cigarette that most people think of, is typically about 85 millimeters long.

And then you have 100 millimeter cigarettes and even super long ones that are 120,

and obviously the length of the product will influence how many puffs that people can get on the product.

Q.  And so when you said the average is ten puffs, is that on an 85 millimeter?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And is that because the 85 millimeter is kind of considered the regular length?

A.  That's the most common length that people use.

Q.  And so the process that we've been describing, nicotine quickly enters the lungs and the brain, binds to the receptors, neurotransmitters, all this happens within seconds, right?

A.  About eight to ten seconds, the nicotine, you know, is � as soon as you take a puff on a cigarette and you inhale the smoke into your airways, it's hitting the brain about eight to ten seconds.

Q.  And so does this � if a smoker takes ten puffs on a cigarette, does this process happen ten times on that cigarette?

A.  It does.  The first couple of puffs are usually most important for the smoker because if

they've been nicotine deprived for any period of time, you know, they're getting release of the dopamine in the brain and those other neurotransmitters rapidly, and that's reinforcing.

And towards the end of the cigarette, they may not have to be puffing as deeply and as hard because they're really smoking that cigarette for the delivery of nicotine.

Q.  How many � excuse me.  How many cigarettes are in one pack?

A.  Twenty.  Typically twenty.  They used to have twenty-five.  I've seen them in ten packs. Little sample packs they used to give out free, anywhere from three to five cigarettes.

Q.  And so doing the math, although I'm hesitant to do that, twenty cigarettes, ten puffs per cigarette, someone smoking one pack a day would get approximately 200 hits or doses of nicotine in the brain per day?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Obviously someone smoking more, a pack and a half, two packs, is getting 300 or 400 hits of nicotine a day?

A.  That's right.

video demonstrating nicotine's impact on the brain?

A.  I have.

Q.  Okay.  And what is the Mayo Clinic, Dr. Cummings?

A.  Well, the Mayo Clinic is, you know, one of the premier medical institutions in the country located up in Rochester, Minnesota.

They also have satellites all over and I think down here in Florida and Arizona and other parts of the country as well.

Q.  And are you familiar with the Mayo Clinic's Nicotine Dependence Center?

A.  Sure.  I know it very well.  Richard Hurt sort of set that program up a number of years ago.  They're very well known for the research that they've done on treatments for nicotine dependence.

And more recently, they've established sort of one of the few places to send people who want to learn how to treat nicotine dependence to get trained and certified.

So, for example, our bedside counselor at MUSC is a trained, certified counselor for nicotine addiction who has been trained through

the Mayo Clinic program.  We sent him up to Rochester to go through the three-day training program.

Q.  Does Mayo Clinic also have an inpatient hospitalization for nicotine dependence?

A.  Yeah, they're unique.  There may be one or two other places that have tried to do this, but Mayo Clinic has actually established an inpatient service to treat nicotine dependence for smokers.

And usually these are reserved for smokers who have � you know, have such serious health consequences yet persist and continue to smoke that � and have the resources to go to the

15 Mayo Clinic to get help to quit.

And so they treat a lot of cancer patients.  They treat people with peripheral vascular disease, a disease like Buerger's disease which exclusively occurs in smokers only.

And it's where you've done such damage that you're not getting blood flow to the peripheral limbs, toes, hands, and feet, and you get gangrene. It blocks off. You don't get the blood circulation, and basically you start doing the amputations, and you've got to get people off

of cigarettes .

That's the most important way to treat that disease because if you don't stop the smoking, you're not going to stop the disease progression.

Q.  And I asked �

MR. BELASIC:  I'm sorry, Your Honor, but, again, this was a long speech, had nothing to do with the question.

MR. PEDROSA:  Move to strike.

MR. BASS:  Judge, we just ask for nonspeaking objections.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, I've cautioned both sides to engage in nonspeaking objections.

Once again, Dr. Cummings, if you can, try to stay as focused as you can on the question. It will help us move through this quicker.

Go ahead, Mr. Bass.

MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May it please the Court.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Dr. Cummings, I started by asking you if you brought along an animation or a video demonstrating some of the things that you've just shared with the jury.

the Mayo Clinic?

A.  Yes.  This is an animation that they use in their training program to educate the people going there to get certified for nicotine dependence treatment.  They also use it with their patients.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd move in PT6129 � or rather we would offer PT6129 into evidence.

THE COURT:  All right.  It's in evidence unless I've heard otherwise.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT6129 was received in evidence.)

MR. BASS:  And, Your Honor, at this time, we'd ask to publish PT6129.

THE COURT:  You can.  You can.

(Video clip played as follows:)

VOICE:  When tobacco is burned, over 4,000 chemicals are released, including harmful tar particles, carbon monoxide, and nicotine.

As tobacco smoke is inhaled, nicotine

22 moves from the lungs directly into the

bloodstream, flowing to the heart and then the brain, all in less than ten seconds.

Rapid delivery is an important factor in

addiction.  Within the brain nicotine fits perfectly into existing receptors on the surface of specific brain cells activating those cells to release certain "feel good" chemicals.

Tobacco provides the brain with very high amounts of nicotine, leading the brain to physically change by creating more nicotine receptors.

When the current dose of nicotine wears off, the millions of empty receptors throughout the brain demand to be fed more.  Now the body will start to experience symptoms of withdrawal. (Video clip concluded.)

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Do people smoke to avoid withdrawal symptoms, Dr. Cummings?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Please explain.

A.  Well, I mean when those receptors empty out, usually within � you know, rapidly declining within about an hour or two after someone has finished smoking, because the half-life of nicotine is about 20 minutes to 30 minutes on average, you know, people will begin to experience withdrawal and will feel the need or urge to have a cigarette and begin to experience some of those

symptoms that I talked about, a little antsy, hunger pang in the pit of their stomach, maybe a little irritable, nervous, can't concentrate, and they'll want a cigarette.

And so that's � and those feelings go away as soon as they light up and take a cigarette.  So that's what happens.

THE COURT:  Mr. Bass, can you find a topic there in the next minute or two to wrap up for the lunch hour, please?

1                  PROCEEDINGS

2               (Continued from Volume 11.)

3           MR. DAVIS:  We have a couple issues that had

4       been deferred.  We had two, we've agreed on one.

5       The issue I wanted to raise with the Court is

6       the possible testimony by Dr. Cummings that

7       Ms. Cooper saw, the Joseph Cullman

8       Face-the-Nation piece in which that offensive

9       comment about smaller babies was made.  If you

10       recall yesterday, of course you had excluded the

11       video, but there was a representation that she

12       saw it and that you had stated that she could

13       testify as to what she saw, and we're actually

14       seeking to exclude reference to that with

15       Dr. Cummings and by her for three reasons.

16           One is that it's impossible for her to have

17       relied upon it because that show was in January

18       of '71 and her one and only pregnancy ended with

19       the birth of her daughter the year before in

20       1970.

21           Second is that it is prior to the May 5,

22       1982 repose period.

23           And third, if there's any relevance to her

24       seeing at a time that she was not pregnant, had

25       never become pregnant and et cetera, it would be

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=138
1346

1       vastly outweighed by the prejudice of just

2       having it come in that way as opposed to through

3       the video.

4           THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm not ruling on her.

5       We'll wait till she gets to the witness stand.

6           What about Cummings?  Who's going to raise

7       this issue?  Scott, you can't take the witness

8       and the argument.

9           MR. SCHLESINGER:  Okay.

10           THE COURT:  Which do you want to do?  I'll

11       be happy to take either one.

12           MR. SCHLESINGER:  I will be happy to �

13           THE COURT:  Scott, I have to be fair to both

14       sides.

15           MR. SCHLESINGER:  That's fine, Judge.

16           THE COURT:  If I let you and not them, it's

17       not fair to both sides.

18           MR. SCHLESINGER:  It's just a reflex, Judge,

19       that I try �

20           THE COURT:  All right.  Try to control your

21       reflexes.

22           MR. BASS:  First of all, I think

23       Dr. Cummings could refer to it because I think

24       he � Ms. Cooper did make that statement in her

25       deposition, I believe, so therefore if

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=139
1347

1       Dr. Cummings were to refer to it, I read case

2       specific evidence and Ms. Cooper said this, I

3       think it goes to her first observing it, it goes

4       directly to her reliance.  And so I think it is

5       relevant whether she saw it or not

6           THE COURT:  I sustain the objection.  Not

7       permissible through Dr. Cummings under any

8       circumstances.

9           We also need to bring Dr. Cummings in,

10       Hardee, and make sure that he doesn't � he's

11       been very good so far about the terminology.

12       Maybe you guys have told him.  "Youth,"

13       "teenage," no "children," no "kids," no

14       marketing like that.  And so he doesn't slip up,

15       make sure he knows that.  That's been my ruling

16       consistently, but he's done very good so far.

17       Maybe you all have told him, I don't know.

18           MR. BELASIC:  And, Your Honor �

19           THE COURT:  Hang on, Mark, till they finish.

20           Okay, Hardee?

21           MR. BASS:  Yes, sir.

22           MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, and Mr. Bass, I

23       apologize, I should have just told Mr. Bass.

24       There is a demonstrative that we were given that

25       I would otherwise not object to that says the

ur Honor, I also think in st things just like that we

1       issues.  If you do, they're just going to make

2       objections, number one.

3           Dr. Cummings consistently through these

4       cases in my division I've ruled the same way

5       with regard to these marketing advertisements,

6       the marketing data, the marketing information

7       that's in the internal documents.  You can say

8       youthful smokers, which you have, which is fine;

9       you can say teenage smokers, which you have,

10       which is fine, but I've prohibited questions and

11       answers regarding the words "kids" or "children"

12       or topics that I think are inflammatory and

13       borderline admissible in these cases.  So if you

14       can, stick to the terminology you've been using,

15       "youthful smokers," "teenagers."  Those words

16       are permissible.  Don't say middle school

17       teenage kids; it's just going to cause potential

18       problems.  Okay?

19           THE WITNESS:  Okay.

20           THE COURT:  Great.  Thank you.

21           MS. LUTHER:  Judge, regarding 1989, I just

22       talked to Mr. Bass, he's not sure if he's going

23       to do it before our first break, and if he does

24       he'll bring it to the Court's attention so we

25       can get it in front of the jury.

Are you ready, Hardee? MR. BASS:  Yes, sir. THE COURT:  Bring the jury in. (Jury entered the courtroom at 1:26 p.m.) THE COURT:  You all can be seated.  Thanks. Welcome back.  We are all set.  We are ready to go.  And we're still on the direct. And, Mr. Bass, you may continue. MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May it please the Court?

Good afternoon.

And good afternoon, Dr. Cummings. THE WITNESS:  Good afternoon. DIRECT EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    When we left off, we were getting ready to transition from a general discussion on nicotine into a discussion on the basis for your opinion that

21 Ms. Cooper was addicted to nicotine in cigarettes.

As a transition into that you were telling us about your experience and training in studying the topics that you were discussing, nicotine, nicotine receptor, basically studying smokers.

A.    Yes, I did.

Q.    Okay.  Are you familiar with a document PT 1809 entitled Smoker Psychology Program Review from Philip Morris 1977 document? A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we would over PT 1809 into evidence. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 1809 was received in evidence.)

MR. BASS:  We'd ask to publish PT 1809. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, you're familiar with this document, correct? A.    I am.

Q.    I think this is � I know, I think some documents or excerpts were shown to the jury in opening statement, but this is kind of the first one that they have seen that's been admitted into evidence so just take a little time, if we could tell the jury what we're looking at here, please.

A.    Sure.  This is a document describing the sort of conceptual model that was used by Philip Morris for their human psychology research program, which was run by Bill Dunn.  And Bill Dunn is writing to Tom Osdene, who was his boss at the time, at Philip Morris about the program and the model that they used to try to understand the effects of nicotine on smoking behavior.

Q.    And so this is in a � what company � Drs. Dunn and Osdene, who did they work for?

A.    Philip Morris.

Q.    So is this an internal Philip Morris company document?

A.    Yes.

Q.    At the time what position or department is � is it Mr. or Dr. Dunn?

A.    Doctor.

Q.    Which department and which position did Dr. Dunn hold at the time?

A.    Well, he basically oversaw their human smoking behavior program that did the research on the effects of nicotine on smoking behavior.

Q.    And is it Mr. or Dr. Osdene?

A.    Dr.

1353 Dr. Osdene?  What position did he hold at the time?

A.    He was vice president for research and development at Philip Morris.

Q.    And so let's look at a couple.  And what we've done, and the jury will get a sense of this, is we've culled out certain portions of the document in the pages as we go through and we're going to read those and discuss them, okay?

A.    Okay.

Q.    And what's the first thing that we have culled out here?

A.    Basically underlying the mission for this particular research and development program looking at human smoking behavior, Dr. Dunn says, "First, every undertaking has to have some mission.  And I would state our charter from Philip Morris in this fashion: Study the psychology of the smoker in search of information that can increase corporate profits."

Q.    And is that what Philip Morris did through their smoker psychology program?

A.    Sure.

Q.    Let's go to the next page we have culled out, which is actually page 3 of the document.

THE COURT:  Doctor, hang on a second.  For some reason we have the machine right behind

1354 your head.  If you want us to pull it over there on top of the thing so can you see it...

THE WITNESS:  That's all right.  I can read it right from the screen.  That's fine.

THE COURT:  If you need it, let us know.  I don't know why we have it back there.

THE WITNESS:  I appreciate you letting me know that it's back there.  That's helpful. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And what does Dr. Dunn write here, Dr. Cummings?

A.    They're describing the conceptual model that sort of underlies their research program.  Says, "There are some distinctive features about the cigarette

15 market.  We sell a product that is often in use from 10

to 60 times a day, day in and day out. We provide a product that is the essential commodity, an habitual act. "

And then it goes on to describe the models in psychology.  First talks about Pavlov's dog and then operant condition, which I think I mentioned earlier is sort of the basic model that they used.

Q.    And when you say model in psychology, what do you mean by that?

A.    Well, it's a theory that helps them explain

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=147
4 And that's what he's talking about, the theory

5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1355

why people behave the way they do with regards to, in this case, you know, buying and smoking cigarettes and using them day in and day out 20 to 60 times a day.

underlying their understanding of why people smoke.

Q.    Let's see what else is written here.

It says, "You are all familiar with Pavlov's dog.  Present the dog food, he salivates.  Ring a bell each time you present the food, and in due time you can ring the bell without the food and he salivate." Right?

A.    That's right.

Q. Goes on, I think you referenced operant conditioning in one of your answers when you were talking about smoking, right?

A.    Right.

Q.    It goes on to say, "Operant conditioning is quite different.  Consider the classical operant experiment.  Put a hungry rat in a cage.  Put a lever in the cage.  Make it so that a push on the lever delivers a pellet of food.  In its random movements the rat will push the lever.  He'll get the pellet.  The rat will soon associate lever pushing with the food pellet.  In time he will be rapidly pushing the lever for food."

24 25

1356 Did I read that right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And so as you've said, this document talks about the two different models, the Pavlov dog and then the operant conditioning, right?

A.    Yeah.  Operant conditioning involves learning.  And you learn you get the reward.  And then you can do the experiments to demonstrate that you can create that learning association, the pressing the lever to get the reward, the food pellet.  And that was the essential model that they're talking about.  You know, what's the reward that the smoker gets? Nicotine.  And it goes on to explain that's the model essentially that they're applying and how important it is to their corporate profits.

Q.    And going down to the next, as you've indicated, a little further down it's written, "Now, consider the smoker.  Smoking the cigarette is the lever press.  The effect of that smoking act upon his person is the reward.  That effect reinforces the smoking act.  He comes to push the lever 10 to 60 times per day.  Our task is to understand the reinforcing

23 mechanism, or process, whereby the habit is established

and maintained.  Such is our model.  Conceptually simple on the surface, but the complexities lurk in

Did I read that right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Was this information, Philip Morris' understanding, shared with the public?

A.    No.

Q.    Did the public know that Philip Morris was comparing cigarette smoking to lab rats in a cage?

A.    No, not until the internal documents became available in the early 2000s.

Q.    Is it documents like this that helps you, as a member of the public health community trying to help people stop smoking, better understand nicotine and addiction?

A.    Sure.  This is a � the operant conditioning

16 model is widely utilized to understand drug addiction

today.  And so understanding what the reward is, how you deliver that reward in an efficient way, how people respond to that reward is really sort of key to understanding drug addiction and how that is a learned process that is imprinted on the brain that is hard to unlearn, essentially.

Q.    And finally on the last page of this that we're going to show the jury.  "Without the chemical compound, the cigarette market would collapse, P.M.

Did I read that right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Are you familiar with what chemical compound is referenced here?

A.    Nicotine.  Right below, it's talking there's nicotine chemical compound.  Is it nicotine and other things?  I mean, that was the complexities of the research that they were doing trying to figure out what precisely it was that was the reward and how that reward is delivered, you know, the administration, route of administration.  And you'll see subsequent internal documents from all the companies that talk about doing this kind of research.  But this is the

16 model, again, that they were using

Q.    Also internal recognition of the importance of nicotine in cigarettes.

A.    Yeah, without nicotine it's clear that, you know, addicted smokers would choose to stop and wouldn't continue to go back to smoke.  New people trying cigarettes wouldn't continue, wouldn't get addicted and wouldn't go on to be regular daily smokers.  So, yeah, it was key to the profitability of the company, so they engineered their products for

Q.    Let's talk about Mary Cooper and her addiction to nicotine, okay, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Okay.

Q.    Have you brought along a demonstrative entitled Key Features of Cigarette Addiction that would assist you in explaining the basis of your opinion that Ms. Cooper was addicted to nicotine to the jury?

A.    Sure.  The demonstrative is just a list of the criteria that I use when I assess anybody for nicotine dependence, seven criteria that I have, some of which I label primary and secondary.

MR. BASS:  And that's PDR 150.  And we ask the Court's permission to publish that? THE COURT:  You can. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    You said this is your criteria, Dr. Cummings.  Could you explain � first of all, could you tell us � well, tell us how you came up with these criteria in assessing nicotine addiction.

A.    Thirty-four years of dealing with smokers has helped to inform my knowledge of what factors really relate to nicotine dependence and strength of nicotine dependence, but, you know, there's a whole host of research that goes around that.  Now, we showed

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

10 mentioned this earlier, whether they're using the drug

11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1360 you a general definition of addiction to drugs, chronic relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive use and use despite knowledge of harm.  This is essentially a way to operationalize, in other words, take that definition, which is of all drug addiction, and apply it to try to understand when you look at somebody's behavioral pattern whether they're addicted and how strongly they're addicted to nicotine.

So the first criteria was, I think I

on a persistent daily basis, the amount of cigarettes that they consume every day.

The time of the first cigarette of the day, which relates to the pharmacology of nicotine, you know, going six to eight hours sleeping without having a cigarette.  Those who have to light up first thing in the morning, they have a stronger need for the drug reinforcement, shows a higher dependence.

Early age of initiation.

Difficulty people have in refraining from smoking.  So trying to stay off of cigarettes and whether you're seeing people with this chronic relapsing disorder; in other words, they're frequently trying to quit and then relapsing back.  Typically a short duration.

1361 Withdrawal symptoms upon refraining from smoking.

And then use despite knowledge of harm.

Q.    Why is persistent daily use under the primary criteria?

A.    Because it reflects when you look at a smoking � first of all, it's a compulsive use of a drug, they have to use it every day, day in and day out.  And it's not just for one day.  You're talking about persistent use of weeks, months, years and decades for many smokers.  And so I think that's a key criteria for understanding behavioral pattern related to drugs of abuse, is the persistent use of that drug on a regular basis.  With cigarettes I use daily basis to separate out those who are sort of the weekend-warrior smokers, chippers we call them, who don't seem to have the same need to smoke every day, day in and day out, versus those who do.  And those who do tend to have a harder time staying away from it permanently than those who display an occasional nondaily smoking pattern.

Q.    Can you tell us, Dr. Cummings, the evidence that you saw in the record and in your review of this case, including talking to Ms. Cooper, about why you believe she was addicted to nicotine in cigarettes?

13

15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24

1362 A.    Sure.  The records that I reviewed as well as the interview that I did with her, the other testimony reported her to be a persistent daily smoker for decades, over three decades by some accounts, up to 33 years by the medical records.

Q.    What about the amount smoked per day, why is that important?

A.    Well, relates to primarily the strength of nicotine dependence, so it's very rare, by the way, to see somebody who smokes every day but they only smoke one cigarette a day.  But the amount those who smoke

those who smoke five cigarettes a day, for example.

14 And so looking at the amount smoked sort of gives you

an indication of the strength of their nicotine dependence.

Generally those who get a pack and a half to two packs a day are what we would refer to as heavy smokers and they are more addicted to nicotine than those who would be classified as lighter daily smokers

Q.    Was Mary Cooper addicted to cigarettes?

A.    She � there's no doubt in my mind she was addicted.  She certainly � by the review of testimony as well as my interview with her and my review of the

25 medical records, several of her treating doctors

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=155
24

1363

defined her as addicted, as a heavy tobacco user smoking anywhere from a pack up to I think a pack and a half by the medical records.  And testimony from family

4 members and from Mary Cooper of herself was that she at

5 times smoked up to two packs a day.  I think she

6 increased her smoking when she switched to a lower

7 machine yield brand, a Marlboro Light from a Marlboro

8 menthol regular cigarette, which is not uncommon.  We

9 call that compensation.  You smoke more cigarettes per

10 day to get the nicotine.

11     Q.    Is dependence in your field interchangeable

12 terminology for addiction?

13     A.    Yes.

14     Q.    One thing you mentioned there at the end

15 about how much she smoked.  Is it your testimony that

16 it increased when she switched to a light cigarette?

17     A.    That's what I gleaned from the testimony

18 that I reviewed, that she increased her smoking at two

19 points actually.  She reported starting out at a very

20 young age and, you know, not smoking on a regular basis

21 but built up to smoking a pack and then went to about a

22 pack and a half, which was a good portion of her life.

23 And then based on the testimony I reviewed, in the mid

'90s she switched to a light cigarette, Marlboro

25 menthol lights, and smoked more, up to two packs per

20 21 22 23 24 25

1364 day.

Q.    You said the lower machine yield.  What do you mean by that?

A.    Well, the numbers you get for tar and nicotine are based on smoking machine.  And the smoking

So it will take a certain draw of the smoke that's the same in every puff.  It will puff down the cigarettes basically in the same manner so you can sort of compare from one brand to the next the level of tar and nicotine and other constituents you can get out of the smoke.  It's captured on a little pad.  They call it � it's a glass pad called a Cambridge pad.  And they weigh that, and the weight of that is the particulate

15 matter.  They call that tar.

And then you can fractionate that to look at what's in the tar and you can measure how much of that is nicotine, how much is other chemicals that you get.

19 And then of course the gas phase, that's what passes

through that Cambridge filter.  That's what makes up the 7,000 chemicals that we've now identified in cigarette smoke, and 60 of those are carcinogens. Nicotine is not a carcinogen, but is what keeps people smoking is one of the things that you find. Q.    And what is compensation?

1365 A.    Compensation is measuring in the smoker how

they change their smoking pattern essentially in relationship to getting their daily dose of nicotine. So they may, if they switch down to a lower machine level � in other words, you change how you smoke in order to extract enough nicotine to supply your daily need of nicotine.  So you may do that by smoking more cigarettes.  That's one way to compensate.  You could do it by taking bigger, deeper puffs on the cigarette. You can take longer puffs.  So you just hold the smoke a little longer in your airway.  A lot of the compensation is unconscious.  People will be able to compensate just by doing some of the things, a bigger puff or holding it a little longer, slightly more puffs on that cigarette so they don't wait as long between the puffs to make sure they get, you know, essentially the nicotine that they need to satisfy their dosing need of nicotine.  When people switch down from cigarettes that have more tobacco in them and therefore they allow more nicotine to be extracted to lighter cigarettes, they often change how they smoke.  That's what compensation is, to get the nicotine, which is why their exposures really don't change.  And, in fact, in some ways they may actually change in a bad way.  By puffing harder you draw the smoke deeper into the

10 morning?  Is it within, you know, right away, within

11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1366 airway, you cover more surface area of the airway and become more efficient in terms of delivering the nicotine to the brain and other chemicals to the lungs and the body.

Q.    The next criteria, time to first cigarette, explain that, explain the importance of that.

A.    It's a weird way.  It's a weird question, I admit.  But we have to ask people, you know, when do you first smoke your cigarette when you wake up in the

the first five minutes or within 30 minutes?  Can you go 30 minutes to an hour?  Or can you wait more than an hour?  And what we have found is people who smoke within five minutes or even within 30 minutes of waking up, those people have a much harder time quitting smoking than those people who seem to be able to delay lighting up.  Maybe they wake up at 6 in the morning but they're not having their first cigarette of the day until noontime.  Those people tend to be able to quit a lot more easily and maybe are not smoking out of the pharmacologic need for nicotine.

And of these items time to first cigarette turns out to be the single best predictor of whether � how strongly somebody is addicted and whether they're able to quit.  In studies that I've done where we

1367 followed 20,000 smokers over almost two decades, we asked them all kinds of questions about their smoking patterns and so on.  The single best item that predicted who was able to quit and stay off, not make a quit attempt, but who was able to sustain staying off of cigarettes, that item was the number one item, not only in the study that I did, but we pooled data from seven other large studies and it came out in every study.

And, in fact, if you look at this particular item, even if you look at amount smoked per day, years smoked, time to first cigarette, it's still an independent predictor of the risk of developing laryngeal cancer and lung cancer.

Q.    And why is that, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Because it's a reflection of nicotine addiction.  And nicotine addiction is the fundamental link to the diseases like laryngeal cancer associated with smoking.

Q.    And what was the evidence with respect to how soon after Mary Cooper woke up she would have her first cigarette?

A.    The evidence from both Mary Cooper and her family members who would be around to sort of observe, whether her daughter and grandkids, as to whether she

136 smoked first thing in the morning all were consistent in that she had a cigarette essentially in her mouth and was lighting up first thing in the morning, within five minutes.

There's a little scoring scheme that you can use, and I scored her at a high level based on the responses that she gave to that question.

Q.    Talking about a scoring scheme.  What are you referring to?

A.    Well, there are a couple of little tests that are used, the Fagerstrom Test For Nicotine Dependence.  Carl Fagerstrom is a psychologist.  He helped bring nicotine gum to the market and they created a little test that doctors could use.  It had 10 questions in it, and you'd ask these questions � or six questions, I think, and then you'd ask these questions and score them and then it would allow you, based on the score you had, are you in the heavily addicted category, are you moderate, are you light, and then you could tailor, you know, with gum, it came out in 2 milligram and 4 milligram.  If you've got a heavy smoker you probably want to start them on the 4

23 milligram gum.

So he developed these questions, or they're named after him.  I've actually seen the questions used

1369 elsewhere before Dr. Fagerstrom created them, but he gets credit for it.  In the '70s he created this scale. It's known as the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence.  And then a version of that scale is called the Heaviness of Smoking Index, which is just two items, time to first cigarette in the morning, how much you smoke.  You can score that in the same way.

And that's what I use.  That's what I tell the primary care docs to do:  Ask them if they smoke every day, find out how much they smoke and time to first cigarette and you've got enough information to tailor a treatment plan based on whether the person is addicted and how strongly addicted they are.

Q.    You mentioned that � the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, and you scored her on that, correct?

A.    I did both the Heaviness of Smoking Index and the Fagerstrom test during the interview so I went through the scoring system with her.

Q.    Why don't we score her now based upon what you scored her.

MR. BASS:  If we may turn on the Elmo, please. BY MR. BASS:

1370 Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence.

A.    That's correct.

Q.    What's the first question?

A.    How soon after you wake up do you smoke your first cigarette?  If it's after 60 minutes, you get a zero.  And you can see how it's scored.  If it's within five minutes you get a grade and if it's sort of in between it's a 1 or a 2.  I scored Mary Cooper a 3.

Q.    Was that based on the evidence?

A.    It's based on my evidence and also the interview that I read in the testimony that was given by both Mary and her family members.

Q.    Number 2, "Do you find it difficult to smoke in places where it's forbidden?"

A.    Correct.

Q.    Why is that part of the assessment?

A.    It's part of controlling your smoking so people have a tough time going without having a cigarette are more heavily addicted.

So that's the basis for the question.  And so the way you score this is just ask that question and the person will respond either yes or no and then you give the response.  That's what I did.

Q.    And what was the evidence in regard to that?

A.    Mary Cooper told me when she was smoking she

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=163
16

18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1371

1 did find it hard to refrain from smoking in places

2 where it was forbidden.  And, again, there was also

3 testimony to that effect.  When I did my interview with

4 her, I just went through the scale and asked her the

5 questions.

6     Q.    Number 3, "Which cigarette would you hate

7 [most to give up, first in the morning or any other?" And why is that part of the assessment?

9     A.    Well, again, it relates to the pharmacology

10 of nicotine.  And first cigarette of the day for a lot

11 of people they rate the most enjoyable one, the one

12 they find hardest to refrain having.  And that's why

13 the question is there.

14     Q.    And what was the evidence with respect to

15 |Ms. Cooper?

A.    She scored a 1.  She said the first in the

17 morning

Q.    Why is something like this, or time to first cigarette in the morning, why is that, I think you said a predictor, maybe the single-most predictor of difficulty quitting, why is that the case?

A.    Because they're in need of the nicotine and it's related to exactly that, the need for nicotine and the pharmacology of nicotine in the body, because nicotine begins to leave your system within about 20 to

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

1372 30 minutes after you finish the cigarette, your � the half life is kicking in.  So over a period of time the need to smoke goes up as the nicotine leaves your body.

nonmeasurable, for most smokers within about two days, there are metabolites of nicotine that last longer.  So cotinine is a metabolite of nicotine which stays around in the body for about two weeks.

But it relates to the pharmacology of nicotine.

Q.    Question 4, "How many cigarettes per day do you smoke?"

And what was the evidence with respect to

14 Ms. Cooper in that regard?

A.    Usually you say, how many did you smoke?

16 And her smoking pattern changed over a lifetime,

typically you say to somebody who is smoking, what's the most you were smoking on a regular basis?  And she reported up to two packs a day.  That was later in her smoking.  From the mid '90s I think it was two packs, that would be 40 cigarettes a day.  For most of her life it was about a pack and a half.  And early on about a pack a day.  So it did change over time.  But I scored her a 3 because she got over the 30 cigarette � 31-cigarette criteria.

that you are in bed most of the day?
		


	And what was her response to

A.
	Yes.
	

Q.
	And how did that type of ques

your assessment of nicotine dependence?
		

A.
	Reflects a strong need to kee

drug even though you're sick.  Do you h

the flu

That's

Q.    And, Dr. Cummings, if we add it all up it looks like she scored, Ms. Cooper that is, scored on the high end of each question.  So you scored her a 10 out of 10.

A.    I scored her 10 out of 10.  She's clearly highly dependent.  Of course at the time I did the assessment � she's no longer smoking, so she was recalling back at the time that she was smoking when she answered those questions.

Q.    And the Heaviness of Smoking Index, what is that, Dr. Cummings?

A.    That's just really two items out of the Fagerstrom scale, and those are time to first cigarette and amount smoked, those two items.  And you just look at those, they score it zero to 3, both of those items. If you were 5 or 6 on those items if you added them together you were in the heavy dependence category.  If you were a 3 or a 4 you were moderate.  If you were zero to 2 you would be in the low dependence.  That would be � you use this with people who were persistent daily smokers to sort of rate their strength of nicotine dependence.

I did that.  You saw the scores.  Obviously

24 Mary Cooper, based on my assessment, was a 6 out of 6

on the Heaviness of Smoking Index.  I use that index

because that actually has been tested head-to-head against the Fagerstrom scale and other measures and it comes out to have stronger predictive validity.  It's easier for doctors to use.  It's what we use in the Quitline.  It's what I use for assessment in our hospital-based program.  And it's what I teach the doctors and nurses to use when they do assessment.

Q.    If we go back to PDR 150, which is the Key Features of Cigarette Addiction.

A.    Okay.

Q.    And secondary criteria are early age of initiation.  And I think throughout the course of your testimony you've talked about the impact of starting smoking when you're young, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    What was the evidence with respect to when

17 Mary Cooper smoked her first cigarette, how old was

she?

A.    Eleven or twelve.  That was from a number of different sources.  I interviewed her and she told me 11 or 12.  Described her first cigarette experience I think with her brother John.  And she had testified to that in her deposition and also I think she gave the same response when she was interviewed by the defense psychiatrist.

1376 Q.    With respect to starting � let me ask you

this, are you familiar with the statistics of how many

smokers start smoking or smoke their first cigarette

before age 18?

A.    Well, first cigarette, about 90 percent of adult smokers will report their first smoking experience before the age of 18.  And then if you look at regular daily use, about a third of smokers who experiment go on to become regular daily smokers.  And and the average age of becoming a regular persistent daily smoker is about 16.  So, you know � and there's a range.  You know, some people are at the low end, 11 or 12 years old, up to age 24 is when most of the smoking experience occurs.

Q.    With respect to when Ms. Cooper became a regular daily smoke � when you say regular daily smoker, what do you mean?

A.    Smoking every day.  You know, you're smoking on a persistent daily basis.

And when I interviewed Mary Cooper and asked her about when she became a persistent, you know, regular daily smoker � and also I read her deposition and looked at the medical records that reported the amount she was smoking and how far back that went, you know, she was smoking on a regular basis around 14 and

A.    1951.

Q. So sometime either at age 20 or in her early 20s she's up to a pack and a half of cigarettes a day, right?

A.    I believe that's the case, yes. I believe that's the case.

Q.    What is tolerance with respect to cigarette smoking, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Tolerance to any drug is you're looking at � addictive drugs, you look at this as when you need more of the drug to get the effect of the drug.

13 And, you know, so somebody might start off smoking

occasionally here or there experimenting, and then you begin to smoke on a regular basis up to some point, like a pack a day is typically a day's supply of nicotine for the average smoker, that's why they put 20 cigarettes in a pack.  Some people are higher.  Some people are lower, but � so tolerance is observing this sort of uptake to that set point of the amount of nicotine you need for your daily supply.  And if you don't have tolerance, if people start off smoking, say, two packs a day just because they're there and they wanted to experiment that would be no evidence of tolerance.  But clearly in this instance there was

1379 evidence of tolerance because she talked about building up in the amount that she smoked over time.

Q.    Difficulty refraining from smoking.  What was the evidence that you saw in the records, the case specific record pertaining to that criteria?

A.    Let me go back because there was quite a bit of it.

Started to quit smoking sometime in the 1980s and tried to quit many times.  Cut back, used gum, patches.  So there were many quit attempts.  They were generally of short duration.  So she had a tough time through these multiple efforts of cutting back on her smoking and trying to refrain from smoking with succeeding at doing that.  And so that was evidence of difficulty refraining from smoking.

MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, may I ask just a housekeeping matter?  Dr. Cummings is being clear that he's testifying from notes.  Would it be possible for him to reference what page of the notes he's using when he's referring to them so that we could follow along?

MR. BASS:  That's a legal objection. MR. DAVIS:  Well, we have a right � if he's using notes while testifying we have a legal right to see him and cross-examine him.  I don't

MR. DAVIS:  I'll be happy to approach and discuss.

THE COURT:  Well, the objection is overruled the way it's phrased. You may proceed. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    The record contains several references to attempts by Mary Cooper to quit smoking, correct? A.    Correct.

Q.    Now, you referenced some of them were generally of a short duration.  What did you mean by that?

A.    Couldn't go more than a day.  In some instances they only went a couple of hours.

Q.    When someone makes a quit attempt or determines they're going to try and quit smoking, does how long they are able to actually refrain from smoking dictate whether or not that person was making a serious quit attempt or not?

A.    No.  In my experience dealing with lots of

people who are highly motivated to quit smoking, many find it very hard to sustain staying off.  So they get up in the morning, they try to go without their cigarettes, they'll use all these aids that we give them to stop smoking and they do it in good faith and yet they find themselves begging the clerk at the gas station to give them a pack of cigarettes a few hours later or at the end of the day.  And I've seen that repeatedly.  I mean, so, no, it's actually an indicator of how strongly addicted somebody is, which is why it's on my list as a marker of addiction.

Q.    Do you believe that Mary Cooper wanted to quit smoking?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And what do you base that opinion on?

A.    Well, she said she wanted to quit smoking. Her family members describe her as wanting to quit smoking, and she was struggling to stay off of cigarettes.  In fact, most smokers would quit if they could, but the reality is it's not easy to stop because of the way the cigarettes are engineered.

Q.    Was there evidence that Ms. Cooper also attempted to cut back on the amount that she smoked?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And what was the evidence with respect to

25

1382 that?

A.    She did.  I mean, trying to wean � I mean, it's a common method for quitting, which is to try to cut back on your smoking as a way of quitting.  Even switching brands to a light cigarette as a way, thinking that maybe you're going to get less nicotine and you'll be able to wean yourself off of the cigarettes.  Unfortunately it doesn't work because people smoke for the daily amount of nicotine they need to get because of their addiction.  And so they will compensate.  They may smoke more.  They may change how they smoke.  So even cutting back, going from pack and a half to a pack or even less than a pack, what we'll find is people will change how they smoke.  Because they need to get enough nicotine to avoid the withdrawal kicking in.  And if they go too low they begin to feel miserable, they get irritable, antsy; and they smoke and they feel better again.  And that's that cycle of addiction that I talked about, which is why it's so hard to overcome addiction to drugs and nicotine addiction in particular.

Q.    Based upon your education, training and experience, have you found that people who have never smoked find it may be more difficult to understand nicotine addiction?

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=175
22 23

24 25

1383

1     A.    Sure.  I think generally because cigarettes

2 are, you know, I think today widely known to be harmful

3 and sort of wonder why people are smoking at all.  And

4 because it's a legal product it's easily accessible.

5 People continue to smoke.  And it's hard to understand.

6 And we belittle nicotine addiction.  But it turns out

7 most smokers would quit if they could.  I mean, that's

8 our surveys when we measure � and I've done studies of

9 thousands of smokers.  If you track them over a decade

10 you'll find virtually every one of those smokers will

11 have made a quit attempt, most will be smoking still.

12 So it's not motivation that predicts ability to quit

13 smoking.  It's how addicted you are to the nicotine

14 that really predicts continued use of smoking in this

15 country.  And that's what our studies have found.  We

16 asked all kinds of questions about motivation.  It

17 predicts whether you make a quit attempt.  It doesn't

18 predict whether you can sustain it.  The physiological

19 addiction to nicotine is what keeps people smoking.

20     Q.    And have you seen statements like that, like

21 most people would quit smoking if they could, in

internal tobacco company documents?

A.    Yes.

Q.    You mentioned as a method to try and stop smoking Ms. Cooper used nicotine gum, right?

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=176
3 Ms. Cooper used nicotine gum?

6 mid 1980s she used prescription nicotine gum for about

7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1384 A.    Yes. Q.    What was the evidence with respect to when

A.    I believe � well, certainly in the 1980s. I think she testified that she had tried the � in the

one to two weeks.  She said it didn't do much for her and she smoked in between using the gum.

Q.    The nicotine gum, I know we talked about the patch as a nicotine delivery device, how does the gum as a nicotine delivery device compare to the patch in cigarettes?

A.    They're both lousy delivery systems if you really just want to deliver nicotine efficiently and get it to the brain so you feel normal.  They're slow absorption.  The gum is � the absorption is through the oral mucosa, in other words, through the lining of the mouth.  Takes about 20 minutes to get the nicotine levels up.  If you're used to getting your nicotine hit in 8 to 10 seconds, waiting 20 minutes is a long time. And the patch is even slower.  The patch has the advantage of you put it on in the morning, you build up your nicotine levels, and then you stay at a steady staid level so you're not sort of crawling the wall for your nicotine hit; where with the gum you

1385 actually have to self-administer the gum whenever you

have a strong urge to smoke.  And normally they

recommend people use anywhere from 12 to 20 pieces per

day of the gum.  Heavily addicted smokers, we tell them

to use the patch and the gum.  And we get better

results when they combine those things together.

Q.    If Ms. Cooper used the nicotine gum in the 1980s did she have to get a prescription from a physician for it?

A.    Yes.  Well, I mean, you'd have to have a prescription for the nicotine gum.  And that's what she said she did.  I mean, I'm sure people have prescriptions for drugs and get drugs from somebody who has a prescription, but that's not what she told me. She said she had gotten a prescription for it.

Q.    What was the evidence with respect to

17 Ms. Cooper's use of the nicotine patch?

A.    Again, similar.  She had used that in the 1990s for about one to two weeks.  And she tried to go without smoking but ended up smoking while using the patch, which is fairly common.  About 40 to 50 percent of people who use the nicotine patch do exactly that. They may smoke less because they're getting nicotine from the patch and therefore they don't need to smoke as many cigarettes, but, again, the nicotine patch,

which comes in different dose strengths, 21 milligram, for the most part doesn't even come close to delivering the amount of nicotine that a heavily addicted smoker would have.  So you almost have to double up the dosing of the patch for most heavily addicted smokers, which we do now for our patients at the hospital.  So we do combo therapy for our cancer patients because there's such an urgency to get them off cigarettes.  And we'll combine those two patches rather than just one.

Q.    And like the nicotine gum, did Ms. Cooper need a prescription for the nicotine patch?

A.    Urn, well, she would have needed a prescription up to 1996.  As I mentioned, after 1996 the nicotine gum and patch both went over-the-counter.

15 And I believe she had used it in the early part of the

'90s.  The patch first came out in '92.

Q.    Did you see evidence that, for example,

18 Ms. Cooper went to church, would she be able to make it

through a church service without having to leave and go smoke a cigarette?

A.    She went to church but she said she would sneak out and have a cigarette.

Q.    And what does that indicate to you?

A.    Well, that indicated she was having difficulty refraining from smoking in places where it

was forbidden.  She said essentially the same thing about going to a restaurant that didn't allow smoking; she would have a cigarette before she went in and if she needed a cigarette she would get up from the restaurant and go outside and have a cigarette.

Q.    Do you know whether or not there were times where Ms. Cooper had to wake up in the middle of the night to smoke a cigarette?

A.    Yes, she did say that.

Q.    And what was the evidence with respect to that, and what does that indicate to you regarding her addiction?

A.    Well, again, the question asks, you know, when do you have your first cigarette of the day in the

15 morning?  But for some people you wake up in the middle

of the night, for whatever reason, and for addicted smokers if they wake up in the middle of the night and the first thing that they're doing is getting a cigarette and then maybe going to the bathroom or whatever that's, again, an indication of addiction.

21 And she reported that if she woke up in the middle of

the night she'd have a cigarette.

Q.    Have you written pamphlets to assist people in stopping smoking?

A.    Sure.

5 wrote it and then they published it in '88 and then

6 republished it again in 1997.  So if you called the

7 American Cancer Society and said, I need help to quit smoking, they would send you out a pamphlet called

9 Smart Move, which I wrote, which is intended to 10 motivate smokers how to quit, help them structure their

138 Q.    What is something called Smart Move, Dr. Cummings?

A.    That's a pamphlet that I wrote for the

quit effort so they develop a plan, help them understand a little bit about why they find it hard to quit.  And so that was the intent of the pamphlet.

Q.    Now, when did you initially write this pamphlet the first time?

A.    I wrote it in '87, came out in '88, 1988.

Q.    That was before the release of the internal company documents, correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    How did the release of the internal company documents educate practitioners like you about the reasons why smoking was difficult to quit?

A.    It was like the lights were turned on to a sort of murky going around trying to figure out why it was so hard for people to quit and what it was about

1389 it, and so all of a sudden a spotlight was shone to really educate us about, us meaning the public health community and those who were working with smokers, to have a deeper appreciation of why people smoked, how the product was engineered to make sure that you would get a sufficient dose of nicotine out of the cigarette so you'd keep smoking it, which makes it hard to get off the cigarettes, and how that was done.

So it was � and the depth of knowledge and kinds of studies were extraordinary.  I looked at it just as another source of data.  I mean, I'd go out and do my research.  You'd have research plans.  You write your grants to do these studies.  This was like having a whole library opened on the topic that you had been studying for 25 years at that point.  And it provided a lot of new ideas and helped explain and validate some of the things that we were still testing.  So it greatly advanced my understanding certainly of how addictive cigarettes are and why they're so addictive and why we have so many people that still get sick from smoking every day in this country.

Q.    Why do smokers need pamphlets, for example, to help them try and quit smoking?

A.    Well, I mean, most people try to quit on their own cold turkey thinking that all they need is

1390 willpower.  You don't overcome a strong addiction with

willpower.  It helps to have a plan.  The self-help guide is a plan.  It's pretty weak.  I mean, a pamphlet is not going to make you quit smoking, but it does help sort of give you an understanding of why, and a better understanding I think helps.

Going to a group and sharing your experience can be helpful, probably a little bit more helpful than just getting a pamphlet.  Adding on to that, some of the medications can help.  Those medications really are designed to help alleviate withdrawal when people quit.

But none of that is a guarantee.  The best of the therapies that we have are probably successful if applied all at once to helping 15 to 20 percent of smokers stay off.

Most people who quit cold turkey the success rates are less than 5 percent.  So out of 100 people you'll get 5 who will quit successfully.

So this is � and I said people sort of underestimate how hard it is to quit, that's what a lot of doctors say because they don't understand.  They've never smoked.  So they have to have an understanding of the addictive process, and we try to educate them how to do that assessment, what tools to use.

bullet that would help people quit, but there isn't one, except take the nicotine out of the product.  That would allow people to leave smoking.

Q.    My understanding is that the jury has heard a stat during opening statements �

MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor, to the reference to opening.  It's not evidence. THE COURT:  Overruled. Restart your question, Mr. Bass. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    It's my understanding that the jury has heard in opening statements reference to a statistic that 60 million Americans have quit smoking.  Are you familiar with that statistic? A.    Sure.

Q.    Are you familiar with how that statistic has been compiled?

A.    Sure.  It's based on survey that the federal government does where they assess who smokes and who doesn't.  Two questions they ask:  Have you ever smoked 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?  If you answer no you're classified as a never-smoker.  If you answer yes you're classified as a never-smoker.

Then they ask the next question:  Do you smoke every day, some days, or not at all?  If you

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=184
1

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

1392 answer, I smoke not at all, then you're classified as an ex-smoker or former smoker.  100 cigarettes in your lifetime but you don't smoke now.  That's how they get that statistic.  And of course they extrapolate that to the population.

So over time we've seen this big increase in the number of former smokers, which largely reflects more people trying to quit and succeeding, but it also reflects a huge increase in our population size that was the Baby Boom generation that came through.  So there are just more people out there who are smokers.

12 And many of those former smokers are people who have

13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

stopped because they're sick from smoking.  I mean, it includes all kinds of people.

But I'm familiar with it, and that's how they get the number.  100 cigarettes in your lifetime, you answer yes to that and then you answer no, you don't currently smoke every day or some days, then you're a former smoker.

Q.    How far back in time, if you know, has that � does that stat reflect the number of smokers � the number of people who have quit smoking?

A.    Well, you can go back into the '60s and get the numbers, like from '64 to up to 1969 I think there were like 17 million.  And if you keep adding the

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

4 Mostly the change in prevalence of smoking in this

5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1393 numbers it goes up over time.  Part of that is population increase and part of that is we finally saw larger percentage of people quitting and staying off.

country, which is certainly plummeted, has come, particularly in recent years, as a result of fewer young people taking up smoking.

So as the information accumulated, particularly after 2000 as the internal business records became available.  That information makes a difference.  It mainly makes a difference to nonsmokers not taking up smoking.  And that's why our smoking prevalence rates in this country are going down and we're beginning to see them decline and things like laryngeal cancer and lung cancer as a result.

Q.    Dr. Cummings, of those 60 million who have quit, do you know how many have died of smoking-related illnesses since 1964?

A.    Of the former smokers?  Well, you know, it's lower than the active smokers, but it's still a large share.  About 1 out of 2 smokers, if you smoked for any period of time, if you accumulate what we refer to as 10 pack years of exposure.  In other words, a pack a day for 10 years that gets you 10 pack years, your risk dramatically goes up for various forms of cancer like

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=186
1

21 22 23 24 25

1394 laryngeal cancer, lung cancer, heart disease, COPD.

2 |And even if you quit you still have a residual risk,

3 particularly for cancer because the dose makes the

4 difference

5           So every cigarette you smoke is doing

6 cellular damage, and your body repairs the cell damage,

7 the DNA damage with every puff of a cigarette, but for those who get cancer they've overwhelmed their repair

9 [mechanism.  And that's why some people get cancer and

10 other people don't, because our repair mechanisms are

11 probably genetically � some people are lucky, they've

12 got good genes, and other people are more susceptible

13 to develop the cancers because their repair mechanisms

14 because of the exposures that they get get overwhelmed,

15 and that's when you see the cancer happening.

16     Q.    What are the current estimates,

17 Dr. Cummings, on how many smoking-related deaths there

18 are per year in this country?

19     A.    Current estimate is 484,000 per year.  20

20 million since 1964.  As I said, half of all smokers

If you look at people who get that 10-pack year history, about 1 out of 2 are going to die prematurely as a result of their smoking.  So it's a huge public health problem.  A third of all cancer deaths � MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  Narrative.

that keeps people from trying to quit, because nobody wants to feel like a failure.

Q.    Have you found that this concept of beating yourself up has changed as the knowledge with respect to why cigarette smoking is hard to quit has evolved? MR. BELASIC:  Same objection.

THE COURT:  I'll let him answer.  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  Sure.  The understanding of nicotine addiction certainly has helped, and it's propelled actually having different therapies available as to help smokers quit and incorporating those therapies into recommendations like in the pamphlets and things that we give people now. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, have we discussed � well, one other thing I did want to talk to you about and that is ultimately do you have an opinion as to when Mary Cooper finally quit smoking? A.    Yes.

Q.    And when was that? A.    After she had her laryngectomy. Q.    What is a laryngectomy?

A.    Where they surgically remove your voice box because the tissue has got cancer.

A.    "Craving" is the term that we use to describe what people say is an urge or a need to use a drug, in this case smoke cigarettes that have nicotine in it.

Q.    Did you see any evidence � let me ask you this.  After � you've seen the evidence of either verbal cravings or maybe nonverbal manifestations of cravings after Ms. Cooper stopped smoking and had her laryngectomy.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And what's the evidence in that regard?

A.    Well, there's evidence that after she had had the laryngectomy she had asked, I think her daughter, to put a cigarette in her mouth because she

15 missed it so much.

Q.    And what, if anything, does this indicate to you about the level of Ms. Cooper's addiction?

A.    Highly addicted.  I mean, there's no doubt in my mind she was an addicted smoker and heavily addicted.  And she said she still wanted a cigarette even after having gone through all the medical procedures that she had been through.  And obviously she can't smoke in her current medical condition and � but still right after that, I mean, her family, her daughter described that she did as well, that need for

Q.    Dr. Cummings, do you have an opinion whether � let me ask you this.  Would you consider

A.    Well, I'm not sure what classic means. She's an addicted smoker, and I would describe her as a heavily addicted smoker.  So, you know, not everybody gets to the heavily addicted category, so she's at the higher end of that continuum.  And she struggled for, you know, over a decade and a half of making quit attempts without success.  And that made a difference for her life.

Q.    Is it your � do you have an opinion whether her addiction was a substantial contributing cause of her laryngeal cancer?

Q.    How does nicotine addiction cause disease, Dr. Cummings?

A.    By causing repeated exposures to the toxins in cigarettes, that's how, you know, nicotine addiction leads to things like laryngeal cancer.

Ladies and gentlemen, we all know he's not a medical witness.  He can answer the question from his expertise and you can determine what weight to give the answer.

You can answer the question.

THE WITNESS:  Sure.

Mary Cooper was addicted to nicotine, and I believe that nicotine addiction is what led to her laryngeal cancer. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And was it a substantial contributing cause of her laryngeal cancer?

MR. DAVIS:  Same objection for the record, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Same ruling.

THE WITNESS:  The answer is yes.

THE COURT:  Mr. Bass, maybe this is a good point to pause so we could take our afternoon break.  If you could, please find your exhibit.

We'll start with a new topic when we come back.  We'll be in recess till 3:00.  Don't discuss the case at all during the recess. Don't access the Internet to gain information. We'll see everybody back at 3 p.m., please.

1           MR. BELASIC:  On the Surgeon General's

2       Report, I haven't seen the excerpts so I don't

3       know �

4           THE COURT:  What have you got, Hardee?

5           MR. BASS:  Judge, we're going to move on

6       from that and I'm not going to go back to it

7       today.

8           MR. BELASIC:  And then Hardee gave me this.

9       We do want to object.

10           Your Honor, that's a Reynolds piece from

11       1984.  It was in the New York Times.  The

12       plaintiff didn't see it.  In 1984 Ms. Cooper was

13       33 years old so only she knows whether she

14       smoked because of advertising.  No one claims

15       that she relied on that statement as a

16       33-year-old.  And there isn't going to be any

17       other claim on the verdict form in Phase I that

18       that's relevant to.  Maybe they want to defer

19       and try to argue it in Phase II.

20           THE COURT:  What's the purpose of this,

21       Mr. Bass?

22           MR. BASS:  Your Honor, it goes to

23       reprehensibility with respect to youth

24       marketing, which is our belief is �

25           THE COURT:  What � how are you eliciting

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=198
1406

1       this, and how are you using it as a predicate

2       for testimony from Dr. Cummings?

3           MR. BASS:  Right.  It's a false public

4       statement, Your Honor.  This is a public

5       statement, as Mr. Belasic said, we don't

6       advertise to children.  The internal company

7       documents are going to � that we need to

8       attempt to put into evidence are going to

9       suggest otherwise, that they do advertise to

10       young people.

11           THE COURT:  I mean, honestly, Mr. Belasic,

12       I've drawn a line in the sand on as much of this

13       as I can to keep a fair balance between both

14       sides, but the client you represent puts an ad

15       like this in the middle of a newspaper and

16       possibly the internal discussions completely

17       conflict with what they say in public.  It's

18       exactly why we're in the middle of an Engle

19       piece of litigation.  And I just don't know how

20       I'm going to certainly draw the line on how far

21       we go, but no matter how good an advocate you

22       are, what your client did or the people you

23       represent back in 1984 to put this in the middle

24       of a New York Times ad, I just don't know how a

25       thing like this I can sanitize it to the extent

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=199
1407

1       that you wish me to do it.

2           MR. BELASIC:  I think the reason is, Your

3       Honor, we're here in an individual case.  That

4       was decided in Engle, and they decided that

5       there were some false misrepresentations.  We're

6       not deciding in this case if there were false

7       misrepresentations, only whether she saw

8       something and whether she actually relied on it.

9           THE COURT:  That's one issue, but the second

10       issue that I have � only reason I've let some

11       of this stuff in, because I agree with you in

12       principle is, they have to prove that the

13       punitive damages are warranted based on either

14       the internal documents or your conduct or the

15       fraud that you perpetrated or the health effects

16       of cigarette smoking that you hid from the

17       public.  And to do that they have to have some

18       ammunition that they can use on this.  And this

19       is not one that's hidden.  It's in the New York

20       Times, as you were describing, or it's on the

21       front page of a newspaper, and I just don't

22       think this is something that I'd be willing to

23       sustain the objection.

24           MR. BELASIC:  Mr. Pedrosa reminds me to make

25       the record that this is improper under 404(b).

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=200
140

1           THE COURT:  Meaning?

2           MR. PEDROSA:  It's just a bad act that is

3       not relevant to the claim.  They lied about one

4       thing so they must be lying about something

5       else.

6           THE COURT:  Well, Mr. Pedrosa, I have the

7       benefit as the judge of now four years of

8       looking at the internal documents from all of

9       the companies, and I respect the lawyers'

10       talents in these cases, you've stood up, you and

11       other of the people representing tobacco

12       companies have stood up, as you did in this

13       trial, and said, which I'm sure you'll say in

14       closing, that you can't sanction everything that

15       was done over a 50-year history, neither can

16       these talented lawyers.  This is the behavior of

17       the companies at a given time, and I think some

18       of the things they put in the newspapers, based

19       on the internal documents, conflict.  And that's

20       why I'm letting some of this in.  I'm not

21       letting it be a sideshow.  If the plaintiffs had

22       their way I'm sure all we would be trying in

23       these cases is marketing to kids.  I'm sure

24       that's what we would be doing.  But I've drawn

25       the line and I'm trying to keep a clear balance

And, Mr. Bass, you may continue. MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor. May it please the Court? BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, we are going to transition into another of the topics that we previewed for the jury this morning, and that is your testimony regarding whether young people like Mary Cooper were specifically targeted by cigarette manufacturers.

Are you prepared to have that discussion with the members of the jury? A.    Yes.

Q.    We've discussed that in your view the age at which someone starts smoking is influential in assessing whether the smoker was addicted, and you've told us why.  But with respect to cigarette company public statements, has it been the cigarette companies' public position that they don't market and advertise to young people? A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 617, which was the � excuse me, 6017. Thank you very much.

MR. BELASIC:  Same objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Is it the same document? MR. BELASIC:  Yes, it is.

THE COURT:  Subject to what I said, it's overruled, admitted, coming into evidence.

MR. BASS:  And if we could publish PT 6017. BY MR. BASS:

Q. Before we do, Dr. Cummings, are you familiar with this particular public statement advertisement by RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company?

A.    Yes.  It was put out in the mid 1980s and appeared in major newspapers as well as magazines, news

21 magazines, for example.

Q.    Was it part of any particular campaign at the time?

A.    Yeah.  Referred to as the open � can we have an open debate or the open debate campaign that

RJ Reynolds ran on various issues around smoking and health at that time, in the mid '80s.  '84, '85 was when that campaign was launched.

Q.    And what was the can we have an open debate campaign, what was the premise of that?

A.    Well, they were talking about the fact that smoking had not been proven to be a cause of disease, that it was still a controversy as to whether smoking caused disease and the position of the company.  And they prepared that and then they had talked about other issues at the time, one of which was marketing to youth and their position on that as well as other topics.

Q.    And I think the jury can see, but if we can just blow up the headline there.  And it says "We don't advertise to children," correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    Okay.  Besides in the newspaper did RJ � strike that.

Let me ask you this.  Who is Anne Browder, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Anne Browder was a public relations specialist.  She worked for the Tobacco Institute, which was an organization funded by major cigarette

24 manufacturers, including Reynolds, Philip Morris and

Lorillard, Liggett.  And they would make appearances on

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=205
1413

1 behalf of their members talking on issues related to

2 smoking and health such as whether smoking caused

3 disease or, you know, issues about marketing to youth.

4     Q.    What is the Tobacco Institute?

5     A.    The Tobacco Institute is this organization

6 that was created in 1958.  It grew out of another

7 organization called the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  It had been their communications committee

9 And they split it off as a separate organization

10 primarily to speak on behalf of the cigarette

11 manufacturers on issues related to smoking and health,

12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21

23

24 25

which they did from 1958 to the time that they went out of business in 1998.

Q.    And we're going to talk a little more in depth about the 50-year conspiracy coverup later on, but if you could just tell us for these purposes so we have an idea of the next exhibit we're going to offer into evidence, when you say the member cigarette companies, who are you referring to, and what are you talking about?

A.    Talking about the major cigarette

22 manufacturers in the United States.  They basically

financially supported and served on the executive committee, oversaw the operations and approved the statements made by members of the Tobacco Institute,

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=206
1414

1 which spoke on behalf of the tobacco industry on issues

2 related to smoking and health.  And they included

3 Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds, you know, Lorillard,

4 Liggett and Myers and Brown and Williamson.

5     Q.    Now, we saw just a moment ago PT 6017, which

6 was in the newspaper.  Let me ask you that.  By the

7 way, the statement we saw "We don't advertise to

8 children," was that a true statement?

9     A.    Not based on their internal business record.

10 It is not a true statement, based on my research and

11 findings of what their business records show.  But that

12 was a consistent public statement that was not only

13 made by RJ Reynolds but all of the cigarette

14 manufacturers.

15     Q.    Besides print do we have a video clip

16 demonstrating Anne Browder speaking as a TI

17 spokesperson speaking on behalf of the defendants in

18 this courtroom and others making a similar statement to

19 the one that we saw just a moment ago in print?

20     A.    Yes.  In October of 1983 the show 20/20,

21 John Stossel invited the cigarette companies to appear

22 on their show to talk about various issues about

23 smoking and health, including marketing to youth.  They

24 sent Anne Browder as their spokesperson and she

25 appeared on the show and then answered questions.  And

we have a clip of Anne Browder's appearance on that show answering some questions about marketing to youth. MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we would offer into evidence PT 1683 J.

MR. BELASIC:  Judge, the same time may we have a continuing objection to these industry organization statements on the grounds of relevance, no foundation to connect it to Ms. Cooper and rule 403?

THE COURT:  You may.  It's overruled.  It will be admitted.

MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor. (Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 1683J was received in evidence.)

MR. BASS:  At this time we would publish 1683 J, please.

Q.    Based upon your review of internal company documents, Dr. Cummings, do you have an opinion as to whether those statements made by Anne Browder on behalf of TI and these defendants in the courtroom was true?

A.    I do have an opinion, and my opinion is that that public statement from Anne Browder was not true.

Q.    Let's turn our attention then to some internal company documents.

Are you familiar with a document entitled "Strategic Research Report" dated February 29, 1984 from Diane Burrows entitled "Young Adult Smokers, Strategies and Opportunities" from 1984? A.    Yes. Q.    And that's PT 3400.

And was Diane � is this an internal

1417 RJ Reynolds secret company document?

A.    It's stamped "secret," and it's an internal Reynolds document from 1984.  Diane Burrows was

4 marketing analyst at RJ Reynolds.  And it's sent to the

5 president of the company, Gerald Long, Martin Orlowsky,

6 who at the time was the vice president in charge of

7 marketing for RJ Reynolds, and Mr. Lees, who was in

8 charge of new product development, and a whole host of

9 other people were copied on it.  Very detailed about

10 84-page report.  And it's a look back over 50 years of

11 the brands that had been successful in recruiting

12 younger smokers.

13           MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we

14       would offer PT 3400 into evidence.

15           MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, this is one of the

16       Banks documents that was admitted subject to

17       redaction, and we don't know what they're going

18       to show.

19           THE COURT:  Well, you got a way to show me

20       on this machine and take it down from up there?

21       Wait a minute.  Is this audio or just �

22           MR. BASS:  It's a document.

23           THE COURT:  Let me see it, or show them

24       then.

25           Okay.  I did redact this in the prior trial.

MR. BASS:  I'm sure that we're not going to show anything that's been previously redacted, but I'll be glad to let Mr. Belasic and the others see it to make sure.

THE COURT:  That one passage you have up, if that's the only passage you're showing you can show that.

MR. BASS:  There's just a few other passages from other pages, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Show it to Mr. Belasic.  Let me see the others.

Next one.

MR. BELASIC:  Subject to Banks objections, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Anything separate from that?

MR. BELASIC:  No other objection.

THE COURT:  It's in evidence.  You can show those passages you showed me.

MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor.

document we discussed and there you see there at the

top � what's the stamp there at the top that's kind of

legible, kind of not?

A.    "Secret."

Q.    Is this an RJ Reynolds internal company document?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And we have the date highlighted, February 29th, 1984.  There's the author, Diane Burrows, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And then you've referenced the recipients, which are over on the left-hand side as we're looking at it on the screen.

A.    Right.  Gerald Long, he's the president of RJ Reynolds.  Martin Orlowsky, vice president of

17 marketing, and Mr. Lees, new product development.  So

the top people in the company.

Q.    And the title is "Younger Adult Smokers, Strategies and Opportunities," right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    If we could move on to the next page we're going to show, please.

And what is written here in the, I guess, first paragraph?

1420 A.    It says, "The importance of younger adult smokers.  The younger adult smokers have been the critical factor in the growth and decline of every

will continue to be just as important to brands/companies in the future for two simple reasons: The renewal of the market stems almost entirely from the 18-year-old smokers.  No more than 5 percent of smokers start after the age of 24.  And the brand loyalty of 18-year-old smokers far outweighs any tendency to switch with age.  Thus the annual influx of 18-year-old smokers provides an effortless momentum to successful first brands.  Marlboro grows by about .8 share points per year due to the 18-year-old smokers alone."

Q.    Based upon your education, training, experience, including your extensive review of the internal company documents, do you have an opinion as to why younger adult smokers are an important means of renewal of the market?

A.    They are essentially the replacement smokers for those who stop smoking or die.

So the cigarette market is an equilibrium of entry and exit. And the entry is primarily the 12- to 24-year-old group and the exit is older folks who have

been smoking who either quit or die.  And you've got to balance that out, otherwise your brands and your company profits begin to dwindle, unless you replenish them with new smokers.

Q.    And you reference the term "replacement smoker."  In your research have you come across that term in internal company documents, including this one?

A.    Yeah, that's not my term.  That's actually a term that Diane Burrows uses to describe, you know, the young adult market, calls them replacement smokers. There's an appendix that's referenced where they're citing some government data on the age at which people start smoking and the average age of becoming a regular daily smoker, which I think at the time this was written it's about 16 and a half.

Q.    If we could go to the next page, which is page 10 of the document.  We're going to see the term "replacement smoker," right, Dr. Cummings?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And it says "Younger adult smokers are the only source of replacement smokers."  Right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    "Less than one-third of smokers, 31 percent, start after age 18.  Only 5 percent of smokers start after age 24."  Right?

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=214
1422

1     A.    Correct.

2     Q.    Then Ms. Burrows says, "If younger adults

3 turn away from smoking, the industry must decline, just

4 as a population which does not give birth will

5 eventually dwindle."  Right?

6     A.    That's what she said.

7     Q.    Again, consistent with the previous

8 statement about important means of renewal of the

9 market, right?

10     A.    Correct.

11     Q.    It references � I say it, the statement

12 about replacement smokers, the next sentence references

13 an appendix B, right?

14     A.    That's right.

15     Q.    And have we also included appendix B to this

16 document?

17     A.    We have.

18     Q.    I think that's page 65 of the document.

19           If you could tell the members of the jury

20 what we're looking at here, Dr. Cummings?

21     A.    Well, this is the reference in the first

22 chapter where they're talking about the importance of

23 the young adult smoker market being replacement

24 smokers, and then they show the age, which I think goes

25 from age 13 in this chart up to 24.  And then they

1423 have � these are government studies actually from the U.S. federal government where they had asked adult smokers, what age did you start smoking regularly?  And these are what the data reflect, which is � and I think this is for males, the data here.  The age at which they started smoking regularly, you can see at age 12 it was about 9.9 percent, and then the median period is 16.7 years.  And very few people start smoking on a regular basis after the age of 25.

Q.    Dr. Cummings, in your review of internal company documents do you have an opinion whether cigarette companies used code words in their documents?

A.    Sure.  Particularly at this time in the '80s they started to use the term "young adult smoker" to refer to the 18 and under market for the most part.  So YAS, young adult smoker; FUBYAS is another term that they used, first usual brand young adult smoker, because, again, it's the first brand you buy that really is important to the cigarette companies, not the first cigarette you might try, which is often obtained from friends or family members.  So FUBYAS are first usual brand young adult smoker.  And they had some other terms like "replacement smoker," "beginning smoker," "learner."

Q.    Pre-smoker, is that another code word that

25

1424 you've seen?

A.    Well, they talk about pre-smokers, learners and confirmed smokers.  Pre-smokers are people who have never smoked so they don't have the experience of smoking, and so convincing them to take it up and try it, you know, requires different things than if you've got somebody who is already a confirmed smoker.

Confirmed smoker is smoking for nicotine whereas pre-smokers have no experience.

Learners, if you're just learning how to smoke, experimenting, first exposure is pretty aversive, so you have to overcome the aversion.  That usually depends mainly on psychosocial reasons, which is a big word to say peer pressure, your friends, wanting to look grown up, a little rebellion.  Those are the things that sort of motivate young people to sort of get over the aversion to inhaling cigarette smoke.

Q.    So following up on the discussion of the use of code words, when young adult smoker is used, we're talking about as far back as what age?

A.    At what age?

Q.    How �

A.    Well, generally the � I mean, the government statistics went back to essentially age 12.

1425 But you can find people who actually report, you know, their first smoking experience, it's rare, but even younger than that.  I think a colleague of mine, who is a radiation oncologist, he said the youngest he's seen was a 4-year-old.

MR. BELASIC:  Objection.  Move to strike, Your Honor.  Irrelevant to Ms. Cooper.

THE COURT:  We're off topic.  I agree. Sustained. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, are you familiar with an advertising company called the William Esty Company? A.    Yeah.

Q.    And what or who is that company? A.    Well, William Esty was the advertising firm,

16 major advertising firm in the United States, and they

handled the accounts for RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company in the '50s and '60s.

Q.    Are you familiar with how some of these advertising companies might gather information that was used for the benefit of and asked for by companies like RJ Reynolds?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Are you familiar with a 1959 study of cigarette smoking among high school and college

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=218
1426

1 students?

2     A.    I am familiar with that.

3     Q.    Who is Mr. W.A. Sugg, S-U-G-G?

4     A.    In the 1950s he was a director, and '60s,

5 director of marketing at RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company.

6 And he had commissioned and assisted actually the

7 William Esty Company in doing a survey of high school

8 and college students on their smoking habits.

9 Actually, not just in 1959, I think they did the survey

10 in 1958 and '59.

11     Q.    And are you familiar with a cover letter

12 from the Esty Company to Mr. Sugg regarding the 1959

13 study?

14     A.    Yes, I am.

15           MR. BASS:  That's PT 1533 for the record.

1427 BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And this is 1533, right, Dr. Cummings, the cover letter accompanying the study?

A.    That's right.  I mean, there was a report that came along with this and it's coming from

getting delivered the report that they had constructed, which is this survey that looked at the brand use of high school and college students and talked about the shift from nonfiltered to filtered cigarettes as well as the increasing sale of menthol cigarettes that was occurring in this target group in the 19 � late 1950s. Q.    What is � before we go on.  What is a

14 menthol cigarette, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Well, it's a cigarette in which you add

16 menthol.  Menthol is not natural to tobacco.  So it's

an additive that's put in the tobacco, often added sometimes to the filter, sometimes to the box, and it sort of impregnates into the tobacco so when the tobacco is smoked you get the taste of menthol and the cooling effect of menthol.  It reduces the harshness and irritation of the smoke.  And because it reduces harshness, makes the cigarette smoke a little milder and easier to inhale it tends to attract younger people who are just learning how to smoke.

pgNbr=220

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

142;

Q.    What is the impact on the ability of an additive such as menthol to reduce harshness and make it easier to inhale on addiction?

A.    Well, it's critical because some people have to learn how to smoke and overcome the aversion to the initial exposure.  And if you can reduce harshness, and there are a variety of ways of doing it with many different additives, menthol is just one, to mask the irritation of the hot, irritating particles of smoke going into your airways, you can get it down into your lungs easier.  If you can get it into your lungs you're

12 pnore likely to take up smoking and become addicted

13     Q.    Does � strike that.

14           You had indicated � well, when were

15 [menthols � menthol cigarettes introduced into the

16 [marketplace and when did they start to gain in

17 popularity?

18     A.    Well, the earliest menthol cigarettes I

19 think it was in � it might have been the late '20s or

20 early '30s.  It was called Spud cigarette.  It was

21 actually invented by a pharmacist who had had some

22 tobacco and menthol crystals to use for treating colds

23 and so on in a tin together, and he made the

24 observation that it actually affected the taste, made

25 it easier to inhale the smoke.  That was probably the

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=221
1429 first of the menthol cigarettes.

And then later companies started to add

3 menthol and spray it on their product.  And that was �

4 probably Kool is probably the best known early ones.

5 And then in the early '50s Salem was a menthol brand.

6 And a variety of different menthol brands started to

7 appear in the '50s and 1960s.  I think Belair came out

8 in 1960s.

9     Q.    Was Mary Cooper a menthol cigarette smoker?

10     A.    Yeah, based on the evidence that I reviewed,

11 yes.

12     Q.    And based on the evidence you reviewed she

13 smoked menthol � a menthol type as a primary brand

14 virtually from the time she began until the time she

15 was able to stop smoking, right?

16     A.    Yeah, Belair was a menthol brand.  Salem.

17 Winston came out with a variant of its regular

18 nonmenthol called Winston menthol.  I think they were

19 100s.  She smoked those.  You know, Kools and Newports.

20 Marlboro menthol 100s, regulars, and then the Marlboro

21 menthol lights.  That was the brand history that I

22 gleaned as her primary brands that she smoked.

23     Q.    You said in reference to this 1533, this

24 cover letter, that at this time, it was 1959, menthol

25 cigarettes were starting to gain in popularity; is that

1430 right?

A.    Yeah.  Summarizing the studies, I think it's in the second paragraph of the letter that you are just showing the top of.

It says, "These studies indicate little change in the incidence and volume of smoking and a further shift in preference from nonfilters to filters, especially to menthol filters."  And that's referring to the 1958 survey they had done now to 1959, the next year.  So it's when they're talking about the shift. It's just over that one-year period.

Q.    And so from 1958 and 1959 menthols are, for this study at least, increasing in popularity and ultimately two years later Mary Cooper started smoking

15 menthol cigarettes, right?

A.    Yes.  Among teenagers and young adults, which is the target group for the survey.  They did a survey in high school students and college students.

Q.    Why would a milder cigarette such as a

20 menthol cigarette be easier for new smokers or

never-smokers smoking for the first time to smoke? A.    Mask �

THE WITNESS:  Mask the irritation of the smoke so it makes it easier to learn the smoking behavior and get the nicotine into your lungs. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    The next paragraph that's highlighted says, "Preference-wise Camel and Winston are shown as holding their share substantially constant while Salem increased its share, especially among high school students."

Did I read that right? A.    Yes.

Q.    Salem a menthol cigarette?

A.    Right.  Introduced in 1955 and had grown. This is now � they're looking at 1958 to '59 and it was increasing in its share in high school students in particular.

Q.    And we've referenced the study that accompanied this letter, and that study is PT 3570. MR. BASS:  And at this time, Your Honor, we'd offer 3570 into evidence.

A.    Okay.

Q.    And there's the title "The Youth Research Institute Study Regarding Cigarette Smoking Among 7,521 High School and College Students in 80 Cities Throughout the United States, October to November 1959," right?

A.    That's right.

Q. And if we could go to the next page. Which is page 2. And if you could tell members of the jury what we are looking at here, please.

A.    This is the � looking at the incidence of cigarette smoking in, you know, 1958 versus 1959. You'll see that they're pretty similar.  They break it down by high school men and women, including by grade level, freshman, sophomore versus junior/senior and then they also do the same for college.

And then you can look at the incidence of smoking, for example, among, you know, young men I think we've highlighted, or overall total for high school students was 56 percent 1959 and 58 percent in 1958 who were smokers.  So a lot of smokers, you know, the majority of people were smoking, which was

1433 consistent with patterns of smoking at that time. These are high school students.  If you go down and look at the college level it's a little higher.

Q.    And we're talking about high school students that includes freshman, sophomore as well as junior and seniors in high school, right?

A.    That's correct.

Q.    Based upon your education, training, experience and review of the internal company documents, did RJ Reynolds take information like this and use it as a business model to attempt to attract young smokers?

A.    Yes, they did.  Their brands Winston and Salem became popular brands among, you know, youthful smokers.  And they utilized data from their tracking studies like this one which was done in high school and college.  You begin to see correspondence going back through the 1960s talking about the same thing.

Some of that information is summarized in the earlier document from Diane Burrows on the 50-year look back about brands that have been successful with young people.

Q.    Who is Dr. R.N. DuPuis, D-U-P-U-I-S?

A.    He was director of research and development at Philip Morris in the 1950s.

Q.    And W.H. Danker, I believe, D-A-N-K-E-R?

A.    Yes.  Mr. Danker was in the marketing department at Philip Morris at the time.

Q.    Now, we've talked about RJ Reynolds and its relationship with the William Esty advertising company and we saw a study.

What's the Roper organization?

A.    It's a survey polling organization, just like Gallup is a polling organization.  Roper, the Elmo Roper polls were done on all kinds of topics for corporations, and Philip Morris used them to study the smoking habits of the U.S. population over time.

Q. From time to time did Philip Morris have the Roper organization conduct polls and studies for their use?

A.    Yes.  The first of those studies I believe that I've seen was 1953, a survey, household survey, in other words, knock on your door and somebody interviews you.  They did 10,000 households in the U.S., representative U.S. population study.  And then they repeated that in 1959.  And then they utilized the information they gleaned from those surveys to help design their marketing campaigns.

Q.    Are you familiar with a May 28th, 1959 Philip Morris internal document from Danker to DuPuis

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 1137 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And here's the heading of PT 1137, Dr. Cummings.  May 28th, 1959, as we said, Danker to DuPuis.

Can you tell the members of the jury, Dr. Cummings, what we're looking at here, please?

A.    Summarizing the results of this large survey that they had done and basically said their survey found people want mildness, mildness is important in choosing a cigarette as any other factor.  54 percent want a menthol cigarette to ease the throat.  Only 28 to cool it.  Mildness is an important reason for switching.  And it goes on.

Q.    It goes on.  And before we go on I want to ask you, Dr. Cummings, what is � I think we talked about the impact of a menthol cigarette on inhaleability.  But what about on, as it says here, to ease the throat.  What's the impact of menthol on that?

1437 A.    Well, the main effect is it anesthetizes,

effect of creating sort of an anesthetic effect in the airway so it reduces harshness in the airway, much like novocaine if you're going to the dentist will reduce the experience that you have in your mouth if they're drilling your teeth.  And so menthol acts as a cooling agent in the airway to reduce the harshness and hotness of the smoke.

Q.    If we go on to the second page, please.

If you could read that, Dr. Cummings, and tell the members of the jury what we're looking at please?

A.    Sure.  This is the following on from the comments about wanting mildness and being important for switching.  It says, "We should also win more young nonsmokers with mildness.  The 27 to 40 percent who smoke right after rising may also prefer this."  And suggested actions, they're actually talking about some design features, "add irritation reducers like propylene glycol to our products.  Plan filters to add [sic] irritation-mildness balance."

Q.    What is propylene glycol?

A.    It's a chemical additive that's used in cigarettes to basically reduce harshness and irritation

143; of the smoker, and people inhale it.  And if you

increase the dose of that that you get in a product you

can make the product easier to inhale.  It masks the

throat scratch that you get from the tar particles in

nicotine.

Q.    "Plan filters to aid irritation-mildness." Let me ask you this before.  What else is propylene glycol used for?

A.    Well, it's the main ingredient in e-cigarettes.  It's one of the things you get, you know, with an e-cigarette, electronic cigarette, is primarily propylene glycol, glycerin, and nicotine and

13 maybe flavors.  It's used in inhaling devices like

asthma inhalers and so on.  That's another use of it.

Q.    The next thing says, "Plan filters to aid irritation-mildness balance."  What is that?

A.    Well, you know, you can engineer a filter in a way that also affects the irritation, the tar particles, the nicotine that you get.  You could create a filter that actually filters out the larger tar particles or allows large particles to come through and take out the small ones.  The small particles are the ones that get deep into the lungs.

So the filter is a pretty complex device, the different materials you can use.  Cellulose acetate

1439 is the primary material used.  Cellulose acetate was being used with photographic film.  That's why Kodak was the inventor of the cigarette filter, cellulose acetate filter, I should say.  It was used in cigarettes.  And so it has effects on how people perceive the smoke and the irritation that they get from the smoke particles.

Q.    You said Kodak was the inventor of the cellulose acetate filter.  Can you explain that?

A.    Sure.  Kodak, the film company, invented the cellulose acetate filter.  They hold the patent for it. Those filters started to be utilized widely on cigarettes beginning in, I think Viceroy was the first cigarette to use the cellulose acetate filter in 1952 and then other companies adopted them so that it became the predominant filter used on cigarettes like Belair and Salem and Winston and, you know, Marlboro.

And it's photographic film.  It's essentially plastic.  And you spray it with chemicals to capture an image for film.  With cellulose acetate used in cigarettes it's colored with a white substance, titanium dioxide, to give it its white appearance.  So the filter is not naturally white.  It's painted that way.

Q.    Have you studied the impact of the white

1440 filter on cigarette smokers?

A.    Sure.  Most smokers perceive the filter as a safety device in the product.  It reduces their risk, takes out some of the harmful things that are in the cigarette.  So that's true even today.  People believe that.

We've studied the filters.  I described earlier an issue of some of the filter material, we call it filter fiber fallout.  There are about 12 to 14,000 fibers bundled together in a filter.  They sort of glue them together with a little plasticizer to bind the filter material.  Made of a long strip.  They cut it and then they attach it to the rod which has the tobacco wrapped in the paper.  And how tightly bound that filter is will dictate how much can get through the filter.  And filter fiber fallout is the fiber

17 material loosens because in order to let the nicotine

through you can't have too much glue in it, in other words, because it doesn't work as a filter.  You have to let the smoke come through for the smoker to get the nicotine.  And when they do that, they get the other stuff, the tar that comes through.

So the cigarettes are � the filter itself is designed not to be a true filter to begin with because it doesn't filter out everything by design.

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=233
1441

1 And the fibers can dislodge.  And you can touch it to

2 your tongue and I come by with some Scotch Tape and put

3 that on a microscope slide you can see the fibers.  And

4 as I said, we have found filter fibers in the lungs of

5 smokers.  And that's a new risk that didn't exist.

6 Because a filter truly is an additive.  It's not

7 natural.  It doesn't grow.  It's not a natural product.

8 It's a truly manufactured additive that's put on the

9 product.  And when you have a filter, you have to suck

10 a little harder and it forces you to take a bigger

11 deeper puff and pull the smoke deeper into your airway

12 and that has some adverse effects as well.

13           MR. BELASIC:  Once again, Your Honor, we

14       object to the narrative.  The question was:

15       What do smokers think about filters?  Object to

16       the remainder on the grounds it has no relevance

17       to Ms. Cooper.

18           MR. DAVIS:  Move to strike, Your Honor.

19           THE COURT:  Strike the nonresponsive portion

20       of the answer.

21           Again, Dr. Cummings, please try to stay

22       framed to the question.

23           Next question, please, Mr. Bass.

Q.    Are you familiar with something called the Philip Morris benchmark study, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And what is that?

A.    Well, that was a study that Philip Morris did looking at the exposures that smokers get from cigarettes, measuring in their body fluids nicotine levels, various exposures to carcinogens in the product and how that relates to different engineering features of cigarettes in the different brands of cigarettes that people would smoke, light cigarettes versus the full flavor, the long ones versus the shorter ones and so on.

Q.    Are you familiar with a document from Shirley Wilkins and Bud Roper to Steve Fountaine dated 6-12-1970; subject, "Suggestions for research to answer questions raised on Philip Morris benchmark study," PT 1546?

A.    Okay.  This is a different benchmark study that they're referring to.  This was in the early '70s, 1970, where Philip Morris was trying to figure out why their current tracking studies which had been restricted to 18 and older weren't capturing all their sales.  And so this is a proposal to try to supplement that tracking survey with an alternate way of assessing

4 young people at summer recreation centers, at beaches,

Philip Morris at the time, when they had presented to him in 1970 the results of their benchmark study which had been restricted to 18 and older, they noticed that the share of some of their brands like Marlboro were lower in their benchmark study than their sales figures were showing.  And they suggested they were missing a group of those individuals.  And so Mr. Roper is suggesting that they carry out a supplemental study, which they subsequently did, to capture the 14- to 17-year-old age group as well as those in the military,

1445 who were not included in their benchmark study.

Q.    And when was that study commissioned and undertaken?

A.    Well, the report is in 1974.  You actually see � so a few years later you actually see the report, a very detailed report that's presented talking about the new competition for the Marlboro franchise and the results of their special supplemental survey that had no lower age group.  So they didn't stop it at 18.  They went below it.  And then they report the results in that study on who was smoking and brand share.

Q.    And is that PT 2827? A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 2827 into evidence.

MR. DAVIS:  This was admitted.  It has redactions.  Have those been taken care of?

8     Q.    And what does that mean, new competition for

9 Marlboro's franchise?

10     A.    Well, they're worried about other companies

11 grabbing the share of the young adult market, which

12 would be � who were smoking Marlboro.  So they were

13 worried about their competitors grabbing off these new

15 the first usual brand, typically, which is why it's so

the usual sample of 18 to 24.  In this study no lower age limit was set."

Q.    And so what did they do?  What did the Roper organization do?

A.    Well, they sought out young people in 35 locations around the country.  They described these as popular hangouts, drive-ins, bowling alleys near the

interviews and added that to their tracking data to update their tracking of who was smoking which brands of cigarettes.  And I think that began in 1972, '73 and '74, and they're looking at these data over those years.

Q.    Who is Claude Teague?  I'm not sure if you've introduced Claude Teague yet, Dr. Cummings.

A.    Sure.  Claude Teague was a senior executive at RJ Reynolds, rose up the ranks.  He was an analytic � or not an analytic, he was just a chemist at RJ Reynolds.  Started there in 1951.  And in the early '70s he took over the directing new product development work at RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company and wrote a number of internal records having to do with how to capture a share of the market, how to engineer

Q.    Are you familiar with one of the documents authored by Dr. Teague marked RJR confidential PT 1040 entitled "Research planning memorandum on some thoughts about new brands of cigarettes for the youth market"? A.    Yes, that's one of his internal documents. MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor � BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And that's dated, I believe, 1973. A.    Correct.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 1040 into evidence.

MR. BELASIC:  We don't object, Your Honor, if they've complied with the order for the redactions.

THE COURT:  Subject to the redactions, which we will do, you can show the document.  Just make sure it doesn't have anything that was redacted on the screen, please, Mr. Bass.

MR. BASS:  I'd be more comfortable, Your Honor, if Mr. Belasic would look at it.

THE COURT:  If you could show it to him make sure he even knows.

6 BY MR. BASS:

7     Q.    Okay.  And this was the cover page that we

8 read marked RJR confidential.  "Research planning

9 memorandum on some thoughts about new brands of

10 cigarettes for the youth market," right?

11     A.    Correct.

12     Q.    Let's take a look at what Dr. Teague said in

13 this regard.

14           He says, "Realistically, if our company is

15 to survive and prosper over the long term we must get

16 our share of the youth market."

17           Did I read that right?

18     A.    Yes.

19     Q.    And as we've seen or as you testified

20 before, young or youth market refers to what age group?

21     A.    Basically you're talking about teenagers

22 predominantly, but the under 24 age group.  I think he

23 refers here to the � you can't have a brand for those

24 who are the established group 30 and under, you need a

25 different brand for them to be successful.  So he says,

1450 "In my opinion, we will require brands tailored to the youth market.  I believe it's unrealistic to expect that existing brands identified with an over 30 establishment market can ever become the in-product with the youth group; thus we need new brands designed to be particularly attractive to the young smokers, while ideally at the same time being appealing to all smokers."  And then he goes on to describe how to do that, what the features are.

Q.    It goes on to describe what, how to design a cigarette to attract the young smoker?

MR. BELASIC:  Objection, leading. THE COURT:  Sustained.  Rephrase. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    What did you mean when you said it goes on to describe that?

A.    How to engineer, construct, create a cigarette that would be appealing to the beginning smoker.

Q.    Are some of those concepts discussed later on in this particular document?

A.    In great specificity in terms of outlining the brand � you know, the nicotine levels, the use of flavors and additives that would be critical to appeal to the pre-smoker, learner as well as the confirmed

1451 smoker.  And he defines those three groups and actually outlines the characteristics of cigarettes that appeal to each group and then outlines a research program in the areas that they need to research in order to engineer products to capture the youth market.

Q.    Does he also, Dr. Teague that is, kind of define what a pre-smoker is, what a learner and what a confirmed smoker is?

A.    Yes.  And we talked about those before.  He says, "The pre-smoker and learner, the physical effects of smoking are largely unknown, unneeded, or actually quite unpleasant or awkward.  The expected or derived psychological effects are largely responsible for influencing the pre-smoker to try smoking and provide sufficient motivation during the learning period to keep the learner going despite the physical unpleasantness and awkwardness of that period.  In contrast, once the learning period is over, the physical effects become of overriding importance and the desirability to the confirmed smoker and the psychological effects, except for the tension-relieving effect, largely wane in importance or disappear."

Q.    So does the new smoker smoke for nicotine?

A.    No, I mean, really the pre-smoker who has no experience with nicotine doesn't know what it will do,

1452 has no notion of the benefits or the harm associated with it.  It is zero effect for pre-smokers.

For the learner, nicotine is initially aversive.  You have to learn to overcome the initial effect of nicotine, which gets you light-headed, might cause you a little nausea.  It's a little irritating on your throat so it's actually a negative.

For the confirmed smoker it's the reason they keep smoking; be it not for nicotine they would not smoke.

Q.    And what is a confirmed smoker, Dr. Cummings?

A.    That's a persistent, regular daily smoker. So there's a table that outlines the different features of cigarettes for each of these groups and ranks them as either having no effect, a positive effect or a negative effect.  And those that are strongly negative get multiple minus signs.  If it's strongly positive you get multiple plus signs.

Q.    Is that what the next page, page 4, this table shows?

A.    Yes.

This is actually talking about the expected effects derived from cigarette smoking, and it describes the three groups.  And this is � it breaks

1453 it down into physical effects, which are primarily, you know, what you get when you smoke a cigarette, versus the psychological effects, which is the second part of the table.

But on the physical effects you can see nicotine response is a zero.  A zero � they have a little scale at the bottom of the chart.  It says if it's a plus it's a positive.  If it's a zero it's a neutral or no effect.  And negative is obviously a negative effect.  And for the pre-smoker it's a zero. So not known.  Double negative for the learner.  And triple positive for the confirmed smoker.  So the confirmed smoker is smoking primarily for the nicotine effect.

Irritancy and harshness you can see is a triple negative for the learner.  Obviously unknown to the pre-smoker.  And even somewhat negative for the confirmed smoker because inhaling hot smoke with particles in it, you know, even if you mask it with things is still going to be somewhat irritating, but people overcome that because they're addicted.

Obviously the manipulation, the handling, the lighting, all those things that goes along with smoking.

1454 these examples of code words of language used by the tobacco industry?

A.    Sure.  Yes.

Q.    The next page, page 9.

A.    Actually, if you go to the bottom chart you can see the difference with the psychological effects.

Q.    Let's look at the bottom chart then. Thank you.

And please tell us what we're looking at here and the significance of this, Dr. Cummings.

A.    So, again, pre-smokers are the first column, the learner is the second and then the confirmed smoker is the third column.

So for group identification conforming, those kinds of things, you know, very important for both the pre-smoker and the learner, that's what sort of gets them to try smoking.  It's not important, it's neutral for the confirmed smoker.  Self-image enhancement, identification with valued persons, daring, sophistication, ability to choose, free to choose.  Those are positive for the pre-smoker and learner, actually negative for the confirmed smoker. Reflecting the fact that once you get addicted it's not a free choice.

1455 the jury now Dr. Teague is sharing the same thoughts, correct?

MR. BELASIC:  Leading.

THE COURT:  It is leading.  Don't lead the witness.  I'll let that question stand. THE WITNESS:  Yes. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Then on to the next page.  Talking about from the previous table, physical effects, psychological effects.  It says here, "A final psychological factor which also did not fall readily into Table 1 involves smoking-health attitudes.  The smoking health controversy does not appear important to the group because, psychologically, at 18, one is immortal.  Further, if the desire to be daring is part of the motivation to start smoking, the alleged risk of smoking may actually make smoking attractive." Did I read that right? A.    Yes.

Q.    First let's say that it uses a term here that we haven't really got into yet.  Smoking-health controversy, what does that refer to?

A.    Well, the manufactured controversy from the companies where they denied the health risks of smoking while the public health community was trying to educate

1456 the public about the dangers of smoking.

So in the early '70s, this is a number of years after the first Surgeon General's Report, companies were still denying the health risks while the public health community had already documented the health � the serious health dangers related to smoking.  And they created the controversy.

Q.    It goes on to say, "In this sense the warning label on the package may be a plus."

Have you studied impact of the warning label on young smokers?

A.    Sure.  I have.

Q.    And what is Dr. Teague talking about here?

A.    Well, he's talking about young people are, you know, are not concerned about the health risks of smoking.  It's either neutral, it's not part of their equation because it's not even in their thinking, or it

18 may actually be a little bit of a risk taking and

rebellion.  And in that sense a warning label on the product might actually be an inducement to smoke rather than the other way around.  So it's either not making any difference to young people and I think that's absolutely true.  The warning labels tend to be more important for older people when they begin to notice some of the adverse effects of smoking.

1457

1     Q.    Does this document also discuss the level of

2 nicotine that Dr. Teague suggested should be contained

3 in the cigarette for the youth market?

4     A.    Yes.  I mean, he talks about the actual

5 product quality factors when you engineer a product how

6 do you make it so it would appeal, have the greatest

7 appeal both to the pre-smoker, the learner and the confirmed smoker so you can capture this young group.

9   And so he talks about a moderate level of nicotine.

10 And he actually specifies the amount of nicotine per

11 milligram delivered at a slightly more acidic level, a

12 lower pH so you don't have more of the freebased

13 nicotine, which is more rapidly observed.  So you lower

14 the impact of nicotine in the young person who is just

15 learning how to smoke, otherwise they get overwhelmed

16 by it and it's more aversive.  So he's talking about

17 moderate level of nicotine delivered a pH to ensure

slow absorption; moderate level of blend, tobacco flavors.  So you don't want to overwhelm them with too strong of a product, more bland.  Perhaps the use of flavoring additives that would mask the regular flavor of the tar when it's burned and ingested in the body.

So he actually goes about outlining these things, so make it mild not, too overwhelming for the young smoker.  Those are the physical qualities.  Then

145; he also talks about psychological qualities of the

product, how it's labeled, the packaging and so on.

Because a cigarette pack is like a badge for a young

person.

Q.    Do different types of cigarettes have different levels of nicotine in them?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And do you have an opinion as to why that is?

A.    Because they target different groups.  They have, you know, cigarettes that are manufactured � here they're talking about engineering them for the beginning part of the market.  They have cigarettes that are engineered for people who are health concerned, you know, they're really concerned about their health.  So to allay those concerns so they keep smoking the cigarette.  And then they have products for people in between.  So they engineer their products for different target segments including the teenage market.

Q.    This talks about the pH of 5.8 to 6.0 to ensure slow absorption.  And earlier we talked about kind of the scale of pH.  How can pH be modified or

23 manipulated to slide along that scale?

A.    Many ways.  Blending so the type of tobacco you put in the product can affect the pH of the

product, so that's one method.  The use of filter and filter ventilation can affect pH.  The use of adding nicotine to the product can affect pH.  And use of various pH modifying additives, ammonia, diammonium phosphate, ammonia hydrochloride, urea, these are all things � levulenic acid is another additive that's commonly been used in cigarettes, all affect pH.

Q.    Which in turn affects nicotine delivery?

A.    Yeah, because if you're more acidic in your range that he's describing here around 5.8 to 6, that's a little bit more acidic.  Remember neutral is 7 on the scale of zero to 14.  And if you stay below 6 most of the nicotine is in an unbound � or is in a bound form.

14 And so it's not as readily absorbed into the

bloodstream.  If you slightly bump up the pH to like 6.5 where you get a very high, like cigar smoke is above 8, high pH, it is rapidly absorbed and can overwhelm a young person who is just learning how to smoke, because you get more free nicotine.  And it's on a log scale, which is a fancy way of saying it's not just, you know, a difference of 1 if you go from 5 to 6 or 6 to 7.  It's actually � it dramatically increases the absorption rate when you just go up a few slight points on the pH scale in terms of the availability of nicotine being readily absorbed.

1460 So you've got to get the right spot for nicotine.  Too high is overwhelming, too low you don't get the absorption so you've got to hit the right spot in between.  And different products have different pH levels.  It's one of the key design features that we

1461 THE COURT:  They've got it blown up for me. I understand your objection.  It's admitted for other purposes.  The objection is overruled. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    If you could tell us what we're looking at here, Dr. Cummings, please.

A.    Sure.  This is a report from an advertising firm that, you know, worked with Reynolds and reported a meeting that was held at RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, included some of the principal folks such as Claude Teague and Mr. Blevins, who was in charge of new product marketing at RJ Reynolds at the time.  And they're talking about different types of cigarettes, different design features for different target audiences.

So one of the groups that they talk about is designing cigarettes for the beginning smoker.  So this is � follows on from the Dr. Teague document in 1973 where he sort of outlines some of those features.  This is about a year later in 1974 they're talking about designing cigarettes for the beginning smoker and describes exactly what Dr. Teague had indicated, the cigarette would be low in irritation; possibly contain added flavor to make it easier for those who had never smoked before to acquire the taste for it more quickly;

1462 it would not necessarily be low in tar and nicotine content; the taste would be somewhat bland; there would be minimal aftertaste buildup, which would tend to cut down on the "motor man's" or "gloves" morning-after

And so they're outlining some design characteristics for new products.  They have low tar cigarettes and then they have some other target groups that they're describing in this particular two-page

Q.    What's the most � are you familiar with when a person smokes a cigarette for the very first time, have you studied and researched what the most common and typical reaction of smoking that first cigarette is?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And what is that?

A.    Light-headedness.  You get a little dizzy.

Q.    And why is that, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Two reasons.  You get vasoconstriction because of nicotine.  So if you're not used to getting nicotine usually in the frontal lobe you'll get a little vasoconstriction from the effects of nicotine, which makes you a little light-headed and also the lack of oxygen because of the carbon monoxide that you

Q.    Define vasoconstruction [sic]. A.    Vasoconstriction.  Basically your blood vessels constrict and so they narrow.  And so the blood and the oxygen that the blood is carrying can't get to the brain and that's why your brain is actually deprived, you get a little light-headed or dizzy.  That can be aversive, some people call it getting a buzz the first time they smoke.  So there's different responses that � reactions to that physical effect that people get.

MR. BASS:  The next document we would like to address is PT 1265.  And I have a note here I'm not sure if that's one that, Mr. Belasic, if that's one that you need to be heard on or there were prior rulings.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor ruled it out in Banks, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  If that was my previous ruling, it would stand in this trial unless you can convince me otherwise or you can bypass it and take it up in the morning and we can look at it together, whichever you'd like to do. MR. BASS:  Yes, we'll do that. BY MR. BASS:

1464 Q.    Who is Mr. Tucker, Dr. Cummings? A.    In the mid '70s he was the vice-president in charge of marketing for RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company.

Q.    And there's a document from Mr. Tucker about a presentation to the board of directors in 1974 that discusses the topic of youth smoking.

A.    Yes.  This is actually outlining the marketing plans to the board of directors to RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company for 1975.  This particular presentation to the board of directors was done in September 1974 in Hilton Head, South Carolina.  And there are slides of the presentation.  He talks about the importance of the, you know, young adult market defined as 14- to 24-year-olds.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 1641 into evidence.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor admitted it with redactions.

THE COURT:  Yes, I did in Banks, I remember that.  So subject to that make sure what they have up there.

Okay, you can admit it.  It's admitted. (Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 1641 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    This is what we're talking about, right, Dr. Cummings, the outline of the marketing plan presentation at Hilton Head Island, South Carolina?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And what does Dr. Tucker � what's written here?

A.    He says, "Let's look at the growing importance of the young adult in the cigarette market. In the 1960s this young adult market the 14 to 24 age group represented 21 percent of the population.  As seen by this chart, they will represent 27 percent of the population in 1975.  They represent tomorrow's cigarette business.  As this 14 to 24 age group matures they will account for a key share of the total cigarette volume for at least the next 25 years."

Q.    Another internal recognition of the importance of the young smoker age 14 up to 24, correct?

MR. BELASIC:  That's leading, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Have we seen similar sentiments in other industry documents?

A.    Yes.  That's exactly what Diane Burrows was talking about in her 1984 review over 50 years which

1467 MR. PEDROSA:  Your Honor, that's the one you looked at.  Provided your ruling has been complied with, no additional objections.

THE COURT:  Subject to any redactions per my prior ruling it's in evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 2003 was received in evidence.)

MR. BASS:  Thank you, Judge. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Okay, this is what we discussed, Dr. Cummings, August 30th, 1978 we see the "to" and "from" subject: Product information.  Correct? A.    That's right.

Q.    And we'll read the portion that's going to be highlighted there.

"The success of Newport has been fantastic during the past few years.  Our profile taken locally shows this brand being purchased by young adults usually college age, but the base of our business is the high school student."

Did I read that right? A.    You did.

Q.    Similar sentiments to Philip Morris' and RJ Reynolds' internal company statements?

A.    Yes.  They all were tracking the success of

146 their brands among young people.  They were all designing their marketing campaigns with products, promotions, placement and pricing, targeting young people, because it was critical to their profitability. Their business model depends on capturing replacement smokers and then keeping them hooked as adults.

Q.    Have you seen documents where companies wrote internal documents to other employees suggesting how they should describe or what terms to use to refer to the young adult market?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And who is a Mr. RA Pittman?

A.    He was in charge of public affairs at Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.

Q.    Now, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company, historically � well, as it pertains to this case as

17 Ms. Cooper was smoking, what brands did

Brown & Williamson manufacture?

A.    Belair and Kool.

Q.    Historically what has the relationship been between Brown & Williamson and RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company?

A.    Well, they've all been members of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and the Tobacco Institute.  So they � both those companies work

1469 together.  Their CEOs essentially served on the executive committees.  Their staff under them were designated, served as the oversight committee for those groups of all the public statements that were made from when they formed this organizations from the early '50s, you know, through 1998 they worked together. And more recently Brown & Williamson was acquired by RJ Reynolds.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 1950 into evidence.

MR. BELASIC:  You ruled it out in Banks. THE COURT:  Show us the exhibit.  He says I did not permit it in the previous trial.

Are you moving in just this one page, sir? MR. BASS:  Yes, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Mr. Belasic, I honestly can't remember the context, but I think this has already been kind of testified to in this trial. So I'll permit the document over your objection. (Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 1950 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Are you familiar with some of the names who are the recipients, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Yeah, most of the recipients are folks in

Q.    I've been letting you read a lot of these documents and I'm going to share some of the load here.

A.    Sure.

Q.    "From time to time when describing market categories and target audiences we use references such as 'young smokers' 'young market' 'youth market,' et cetera.  These terms do not accurately describe what we are talking about.  In the future when describing the low-age end of the cigarette business please use the term 'young adult smoker' or 'young adult smoking

that these terms should be used in all written

Did I read that right? A.    You did.

Q.    Let's go back, if we could, to the "from" and the "to."

Remind us who Mr. RA Pittman is or was? A.    Again, he's in marketing.  I believe he at the time was in charge of public affairs at Brown & Williamson.

Q.    Thank you, Dr. Cummings.

Q.    Is this something that cigarette companies spokespersons have publicly denied? A.    Yes.

MR. BELASIC:  Objection, no relevance to Ms. Cooper and 403, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Those objections are overruled. MR. BELASIC:  May it be continuing so I don't waste any time?

THE COURT:  You may, yes, of course. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And do we have a clip of Anne Browder referencing � let me ask you this.  Superman II, we're probably all familiar with that movie, right? A.    Yeah.

Q.    Were Marlboro � was there a product placement with respect to Marlboro cigarettes in Superman II?

A.    There was.

Q.    And do we have a clip of Anne Browder at PT 1683GC publicly denying that Philip Morris had anything to do with that product placement?

A.    Yes.  This is back in October of 1983.  I think we saw a clip before of Anne Browder, it's the

And, you know, she gave her response that, you know, there wasn't anything � that cigarette companies don't advertise in movies.  And then there's subsequent documentation to show that three years earlier that Philip Morris had paid for that product placement. MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 1683GC into evidence.

MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I will object Williams/State Farm, totally unrelated to this case.

MR. BASS:  Excuse me, there are no speaking objections.

THE COURT:  "Relevance" is a nonspeaking objection.

Marlboro made by Philip Morris is shown at least 13 times.  I asked the Tobacco Institute why Marlboros were shown so often in Superman II.

VOICE:  Do you think cigarette manufacturers had something to do with that?

VOICE:  Yeah.  I think that � VOICE:  Cigarette manufacturers don't make movies.

VOICE:  What do you think, that the moviemaker just showed Marlboro on his own?

VOICE:  Perhaps the moviemaker was a Marlboro smoker.

(Video clip concluded.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, as you said before, do you know what year this clip was � A.    1983. Q.    Yes, sorry.

You said earlier that you had seen documents from as early as three or four years prior saying that that was not true, correct?

A.    That's right.  1979 is the agreement between Philip Morris and the company that did the product placements and how much money they spent for it.

Q.    Have you also seen document � what are some other movies that there were agreements for products, for cigarettes to be placed in?

A.    There are documents that talk about dozens and dozens of movies where there were product placements provided where different companies, Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds in particular, paid for product placements in the movie.  Brown & Williamson also did the same.  Movies like The Muppet Movie, Grease, Baby, which was sort of a dinosaur-type movie, Jaws 2.

So there's a Philip Morris document from I think it's the 1980s that sort of gives a 10-year history going back of the movies where they had had product placements.

MR. DAVIS:  Objection, move to strike, contents of documents not in evidence.

THE COURT:  Overruled.  Answer stands. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, are you familiar with a document to a Mr. Gerald Long, executive vice-president of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company, May 4th, 1981 from Rogers and Cowan, public relations firm, regarding product placement with respect to celebrities?

A.    Yes.

MR. BELASIC:  You haven't ruled on it before, Your Honor, but 403 and relevance, no foundation for Ms. Cooper.

Q.    This is the top of the letter that we're looking at, Dr. Cummings, to Mr. Gerald Long, executive vice-president 1981, correct? A.    Correct.

Q.    If we go down a little bit, ask you to read what that says.

A.    "Our primary objective for the year will remain the same:  To have smoking featured in a prominent way especially when it is tied favorably with celebrities."

1476 the impact of tieing a product like cigarettes to celebrities?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And the impact that has on the smoking environment, smoking culture?

A.    Sure.  Absolutely.  Products that get associated with celebrities tend to sell better.  They are particularly effective particularly in the movies because young people tend to go to the movies.  And it's directly related, the number of exposures people get to smoking-related scenes in movies, it is actually correlated with the likely uptake of smoking, increased likelihood of experimentation and eventual uptake of smoking because experimentation is the gateway into then becoming a smoker.

So that actually has been studied extensively and there are conclusions in the Surgeon General's Report that talk about the very important role of product placements on television, in movies, before that it was in the radio and celebrities like athletes and so on and how that relates to normalizing smoking behavior in a population and makes it attractive to young people.

MR. BASS:  Yes, Your Honor. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And this is actually the last document I was going to ask you about, Dr. Cummings, for this particular section.  And it's PT 1505.  And let me ask you, are you familiar with whether Sylvester Stallone was paid to have cigarettes placed in his movies?

A.    Yes.  I mean, Sylvester Stallone had an agreement with a company that was hired by Brown & Williamson to have Brown & Williamson products, you know, featured in five of his films.  And he was paid about a half a million dollars in two segments because he was the producer of his films and describes the particular films like Rambo and Rocky IV where product placements were paid for in the form of cash and gifts.

Q.    And is that the agreement represented in documents PT 1505 and also PT 5020?

A.    Yes.  The first document is the � sort of outlines which films.  And the second document is the letter from Sylvester Stallone acknowledging the amount of money that Brown & Williamson would pay.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we would move both PT 1505 and PT 5020 into evidence.

147 MR. BELASIC:  Just a second, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. BELASIC:  The first one was admitted in Banks, Your Honor.  Objection to relevance in this case, no relevance to Ms. Cooper.

THE COURT:  They'll be in evidence. Overruled.

(Plaintiff's Exhibits PT 1505 and PT 5020 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And is this � this is one of the document also you were talking about, right, Dr. Cummings?  This is a letter to Sylvester Stallone.

"Dear Mr. Stallone:  In furtherance of the agreement reached between yourself and Associated Film Promotions, Inc. representing their client Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, B&W, I wish to put in summary form the various understandings and details regarding B&W's appearances and usage in your next five scheduled motion pictures." Right? A.    Correct.

Q.    And then it goes on, as you said, to state those five pictures, Rhinestone Cowboy, Godfather III, Rambo, 50/50, Rocky IV, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    Then the payment as you described.

"In consideration for these extensive film appearances of B&W products, Brown & Williamson agrees to forward to Robert Kovoloff and Associated Film Promotions, Inc. their initial deposit to you of $250,000.  This represents a 50 percent deposit of the total financial commitment by B&W.  The subsequent $250,000 is agreed to be forwarded in five equal payments of $50,000 each payable at the inception of production of each participating film." Did I read that right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And 5020 is the letter from Sylvester Stallone to the aforementioned Robert Kovoloff where

16 Mr. Stallone is saying it's his understanding that

Brown & Williamson will pay a fee of $500,000, right? A.    That's right.  This letter comes before and then you actually get the contract that lists the five films.  So this letter was first.  This letter was

21 April and the contract was agreed to in June.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, this would be an appropriate �

THE COURT:  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to let you get to the parking lot,

1       make sure you beat the traffic.

2           We're going to recess for the evening.

3       Don't discuss the case this evening with your

4       loved ones.  Don't access the internet for any

5       information.

6           We'll be back in session �

7           Ah, we have motion calendar tomorrow, Wes,

8       right?

9           I'll tell you what, just to be safe so you

10       don't sit out in the hallway, 9:15 in the

11       morning.  I start at 8:45, but I think we'll be

12       done by 9:00.  So 9:15 tomorrow morning.

13           Have a good evening, everyone.  See you at

14       9:15.

15            (Jury exited the courtroom at 4:47 p.m.)

16           MR. BASS:  Judge, could we address one thing

17       with Your Honor's permission?  That is the

18       speaking objections by the defense.  "Relevance"

19       is sufficient, but the theme of their case is

20       going to be and they're able to inject it in

21       these speaking objections none of the things

22       that we showed impacted or pertained to

23       Ms. Cooper, so they're getting extra shots every

24       single objection.

25           THE COURT:  I don't think they've gone too

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=273
1481

1       far, but I think "relevance" is enough.  You've

2       already said that during your opening.

3           What else?

4           MR. BELASIC:  Here's the issue on that,

5       Judge Tuter.  Certainly not to denigrate Hardee,

6       who's been cooperative and apparently has been

7       brought in as a last-minute substitute, but the

8       agreement in the three days we spent last week

9       was that the Banks' rulings were going to apply.

10       And Mr. Johnstone agreed that he would abide by

11       them.  Mr. Gdanski agreed.  Now, Mr. Johnstone

12       is not in the courtroom.  Mr. Gdanski is not in.

13       Hardee has to come in at the last moment.  And

14       so they're not redacting these documents.

15       Either they're not redacting the documents or

16       they make me look at them during the trial.  The

17       whole point is it ought to be their burden.  If

18       they follow Banks, I don't have to say anything,

19       we don't waste all this time.

20           THE COURT:  Well, I agree.  I agree and I

21       think some of the documents you all pulled out

22       maybe had not been admitted in Banks.  I agree

23       with you, you guys need to go through those and

24       give them to him.  The reason we did this was to

25       avoid disruption.  Whatever was accepted in

1       Banks they're going to accept in this trial.

2       And reluctant as they may be to the system to

3       avoid the necessity of what I did in Banks was

4       to go through three days of pretrial hearings on

5       every exhibit and every document and every word.

6       So you guys just keep working together on it.

7       So far I don't see anything extraordinary, Mark,

8       but I'll make him wait so you guys can look at

9       every one of them.  It's all fair to everybody.

10           MR. BELASIC:  I don't want the Court to

11       wait.  I don't want to have to do anything.

12       It's their burden.  They follow Banks and I

13       don't object at all and the trial moves along

14       smoothly.  Apparently, though, they want to put

15       me in the position where I have to look like I'm

16       trying to keep documents out.

17           THE COURT:  There's some �

18           MR. BELASIC:  I agreed that you were right

19       and if you ruled them in and we preserve our

20       objection �

21           THE COURT:  There's some degree of truth in

22       that.  It looks like they're objecting to

23       everything or trying to hide something and

24       that's what we're trying to avoid.  What

25       documents you want in, we're putting in; what

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=275
1483

1       documents they want in, they're going to put

2       consistent with Banks.

3           So, Hardee, if you could take a look at that

4       list tonight, make sure you stick to that

5       exhibit list.  If there's anything different

6       than that, then you all discuss it at the

7       breaks, or if he says, I haven't seen that one,

8       put it aside, when we get to the break then you

9       guys can discuss it and I'll make a ruling

10       outside the presence of the jury.

11           Everybody is doing fine.

12           MR. BELASIC:  I want to make sure we're

13       going to be able to finish cross of

14       Dr. Cummings.

15           THE COURT:  How much longer do you think

16       you've got?

17           MR. BASS:  Judge, I was planning on

18       tendering Dr. Cummings at some point tomorrow.

19       And the best I can say right now without going

20       back and reviewing is in between lunch and close

21       of day.

22           THE COURT:  They'll start sometime in the

23       next day.  Well, he's going to be here all day

24       the next day.

25           MR. BELASIC:  And Dr. Cummings is available

documents that the � Mr. Hardee wants to use with Dr. Cummings relating to the 30-year-old � I guess about the '84 dispute between Philip Morris and Merrill Dow regarding the comments that I guess they had made about � it was a business dispute about supply materials �

THE COURT:  Right.  I'm familiar with it.

MR. DAVIS:  You had excluded this even in Naugle 2.  The dispute between the companies about who they would purchase products from is irrelevant, is what you said.

It's a 10-, 15-minute cross probably. If it comes in, I'm happy to do it.  It ends up nowhere in my judgment.  I don't think it's relevant.

THE COURT:  I don't think it's relevant either.

What do you want to say?

MR. BASS:  Judge, I'm not sure what the ruling was in Banks.

THE COURT:  I have considered it in Phase II, but I don't think it's relevant at all.

I read that stuff, Hardee.  I read what happened between the two, and I remember y'all

MR. GDANSKI:  I think in �

THE COURT:  Who is going to argue this? Not both, but one can.

MR. GDANSKI:  I can tell him what happened in the past, or I can tell you.

THE COURT:  Sure.

MR. GDANSKI:  Well, in Banks, my recollection is, as you ruled in the other cases, I think, quite frankly, you permitted a general discussion in this phase of the trial about the Dow Nicorette dispute.

THE COURT:  Here's what I did do:  I think I let in a newsletter.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.

THE COURT:  And I think I didn't let in any of those internal documents �

MR. GDANSKI:  Exactly.

THE COURT:  � because it looked like what was happening, if I'm right, that somehow a newsletter was created, and what Dow � excuse me, Philip or somebody wanted was to kill the newsletter because they didn't want � excuse me,

not Dow, but one of the tobacco companies because it had something to do with the patch or some something to do with somebody preventing smoking.

MR. GDANSKI:  Dow was going to come out with Nicorette gum.  They said:  If you come out with this product, we're not going to purchase any more � if you come out with Dow Nicorette gum, we're not going to purchase any more of your product to put into our cigarettes.

And I think Your Honor let that general discussion into evidence, and then let in a discussion about the newsletter, and, from recollection, you didn't let in the underlying two Philip Morris documents on the issue.

THE COURT:  I think he's exactly right.

MR. GDANSKI:  Right.  So we should be able to talk about it, and that's what we'd like to do.

MR. DAVIS:  You know, Your Honor, I can't remember specifically.  I don't think it was ever about:  If you put out Nicorette gum, then we're not going to deal with you anymore.

I think it was the way it was being

excluded in Naugle 2 even in the punitive phase.

THE COURT:  I let in somewhere, Stan, after reconsideration and re-review of the documents, not the documents, but the discussion because I thought it was relevant about them trying to kill the newsletter that was going out. Only one went out.  It was going to doctors, if I'm right.

Mark, am I right about this?

MR. BELASIC:  I was not in Naugle.

THE COURT:  There was a newsletter that was going to medical providers about the use of something to stop smoking.

One of the tobacco companies didn't like it and didn't want it, allegedly retaliated by not buying whatever the chemical was from Dow, and there arose a dispute.

The dispute between the companies and who they do business with, in my opinion, doesn't

21 matter.  It's of no issue to this case, but the

fact that they tried to kill the newsletter that would have stopped smoking, I think I did let that in.

I think Mr. Gdanski's assessment is

MR. BELASIC: I want to make sure that the plaintiffs have redacted Banks. That's what we agreed to a week ago.  All I had to do was nod.

It was proposed by Mr. Johnstone and Gdanski, and if they're not going to live it up to it, we're not going to agree to it if I have to object anyway.

We agreed so it would be more efficient; it wouldn't burden Your Honor.  They proposed it. Banks has admitted �

THE COURT:  Do you have in sequence when you're calling this, Mr. Bass, because then he doesn't have to rifle through these things, if you can give him a heads-up.

Who is there that's doing all the technology?  Give him a list or write down the next ten so he can read ahead and then keep ten ahead so he can keep looking.

That's why we're able to move through this quicker.  Make sure they are, and whoever it is, Jon or him or someone, write down the next ten exhibits, give them to the defense.

How is the targeting of youths by the companies relevant to Mary Cooper?

MR. DAVIS:  Objection to the legal conclusion, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Sustained. Rephrase. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  How old was Mary Cooper when she started smoking cigarettes?

A.  Eleven or twelve years old, I think she said she first started smoking, and then by the

time she was 14 or 15 years old, she was smoking on a daily basis, buying her own cigarettes.

Q.  And is that of the age when � strike that.

Is that of the age that these cigarette companies were targeting?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Let's transition now, Dr. Cummings, if we can, to talk about the environment that Mary Cooper was born into, the smoking environment, the smoking culture that Mary Cooper was born into and grew up in.

A.  Okay.

Q.  And, first, I think we established this, but just to set the context and remind us, what year was Mary Cooper born?

A.  1951.

Q.  How different was smoking perceived in 1951, in the 1950s, 1940s than it is today?

A.  Very different.  You could smoke anywhere.  You could light up anywhere.  You know, you saw celebrities and movie stars, athletes promoting different cigarette brands.

Half of all doctors were smoking in the early 1950s.  Fifty-eight percent of men, I think

it was about thirty-six percent of women were cigarette smokers based on a Roper poll by Philip

Q.  What are some of the places that you could smoke at that time, 1940s, 1950s, that you certainly can't smoke today, especially in Florida?

A.  Well, if you'd been in a courtroom, you probably all would have had ashtrays in front of you back in the 1950s, and probably half of you would have been smoking on an airplane, on a train, buses, hospitals, cafeterias, everywhere. I mean you could light up anywhere,

14 pnovie theatres.  There were no restrictions at all

15 on where people could smoke.  It was part of

16 Americana, part of the culture, and it was

17 marketed anywhere.

18           And here are some examples, and that was

19 true of the '50s, as well as into the '60s.  Half

20 of the advisory committee to the Surgeon General

21 were smokers.  Three of them were cigarette

22 smokers, one a pipe smoker, one a cigar smoker.

23      Q.  And you say half of the advisory

24 committee to the Surgeon General.

25           Would you remind us what we're talking

about there?

A.  Well, in 1964, the advisory report to the Surgeon General considered � the first 1964 Surgeon General's report, they appointed a group of doctors and scientists who reviewed the evidence on smoking and health.

And, as I said, half of them, if you look at the pictures of the committee sitting around and deliberating going over the published articles, you can see the ashtrays on the table at the National Institute of Health Library where they met and were sequestered for about 18 months as they prepared their report.

Q.  You referenced that advertising and

15 [marketing of cigarettes play a role, a major role

16 in creating the smoking environment and culture of

17 that time period?

18      A.  Sure.  Advertising cigarettes were among

19 the most heavily advertised consumer products in

20 [America, and, you know, before television, it was

21 magazines and radio and newspapers and of course

22 point-of-sale and billboards.

23           But when television came around,

24 cigarette companies were probably the largest

25 advertisers on television.  They were sponsoring,

1509

you know, anywhere from about 60 to 80 shows, and there were only three stations.

So you saw advertising virtually nonstop during the '50s and '60s.  Many shows were sponsored by cigarette companies.  So it was, again, growing up in there.

You know, I'm 61 years old.  So I grew up in that era.  I was born in '53.  So I remember it well, and at school, you made ashtrays for

You painted them up, and that was just part of what you did. It's very different today obviously, which is a good thing.

Q.  Have you studied messages portrayed by cigarette advertising in the 20th century?

A.  I have.  I have � obviously my background in health behavior and health communications is an area, and I've accumulated an archive of over 10,000, you know, print and point-of-sale advertisements.

I have a collection of over 700 television ads for cigarettes that I've prepared and put on an archive, digital now.  Everything is in the digital world.

And I've created exhibits that try to

4 marketing, as well as the public health message,

explain and help people understand the rise and fall of, you know, the diseases caused by smoking in this country and how that was related to

because as the public health message began to come out and more and more people began to get exposed to that, fewer people took up smoking.

And now we see a decline in prevalence and a decline in the diseases related to smoking.

Q.  And, Dr. Cummings, just to give the jury an idea �

THE COURT: Mr. Bass, make sure we show the demonstratives to the defense first before we show it to the witness.

MR. BASS:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Thank you, sir.

MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Dr. Cummings, we're going to show some advertisements and everything, but just to give the jury an idea of how different smoking was perceived at that time, were cigarettes given as holiday gifts in that era?

A.  Sure.  They would come at Christmastime. You would get the holiday gift wrapping for the

cartons.  They were given away as gifts.  I remember it well.

My family, they would have the cartons of cigarettes under the tree.  It was a common practice back in the '50s and '60s, and they would come very nicely decorated, and they would have promotions that would come out around November, December period.

And that was Christmas.  And then they'd have them for the holidays, like Father's Day and

Q.  And this is just for demonstrative purposes an example of a Salem box that might have been given around the holidays in that particular era?

A.  Yes. Q.  Okay.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, if we may just show the jury for demonstrative purposes? THE COURT:  Yes.

They're not to be considered as evidence.  They're to help explain the witness's testimony.  You can't consider them as evidence unless and until they're admitted into evidence. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Have you also collected

an archive of ads of different brands from different time periods during the history of cigarette marketing?

A.  I have.

Q.  Actually, you know what � and, interestingly, this �

MR. BASS:  May I approach the witness, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Of course.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  This also has a � what is that down there in the bottom corner?

A.  Oh, that's a warning.  It says: Caution:  Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health.

And that was the warning that began to appear on cigarette packs and cartons beginning in 1966 and remained on the packs and cartons until 1970.  So this is obviously between '66 and 1970.

Q.  Are there other decorations on the box and other writings on the box as well?

A.  Well, Merry Christmas.  Menthol, fresh, filtered cigarettes.

So it's kind of a selling message that Salem used.

A.  Correct.

Q.  Through what year?

A.  1970.

Q.  And so this would have been given or advertised as a holiday gift in between 1966 and 1970?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  Right in the era when Mary Cooper was smoking?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Did Mary Cooper smoke Salem cigarettes?

A.  Yes, she did.

Q.  Do you have an opinion, Dr. Cummings, as to whether cigarette marketing and advertising contributed to the smoking environment of the 20th century?

A.  Sure, I do.

Q.  And what is your opinion?

A.  It did.  I mean you don't sell brands. Every brand that's sold is presold in terms of

somebody going in.  They just don't say:  Give me any cigarette you've got.

You buy a particular brand, and that's the direct result of consumer marketing and advertising.  Those aren't my words.  They come right out of the business records of the companies.

So cigarette advertising between 1940 and 2005, they spent $250 billion in marketing, the most heavily advertised consumer product on the planet.

And so it has had an effect, and that's not only my opinion, but it's the opinion of the Surgeon General's report.

MR. BELASIC:  Objection.  Bolstering.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  Strike the last part.  That's not responsive to the question, and it is bolstering.  Disregard the last remark by the witness.

Go ahead, Mr. Bass. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Do you have an opinion as to whether cigarette advertising contributed to

12 us a little bit of background of how much in your

13 career you have studied and researched � well,

14 let me ask you this:  Have you studied and

15 researched the impact of cigarette advertising on

16 smokers that started smoking in the past?

17      A.  Yes.

18      Q.  And �

19      A.  I've studied �

20      Q.  I'm sorry.

21      A.  I've written many articles on cigarette

22 marketing and the effects of cigarettes on

23 marketing, on brand use, on brand switching.

24           So it's an area of focus of the research

25 that I've done.  I've taught classes to graduate

students on the topic of marketing and advertising where obviously cigarette marketing has been a component of that because it's a big factor in the effect on human health.

And so when I teach public health programs, obviously that's the focus of � you know, the teaching is on the health implications of some of the marketing that's been done.

Q.  Besides your own independent research, have you reviewed documents, whether they be government documents or internal business records of the defendants, that talk about the importance of advertising on consumers?

A.  Sure.  I've written papers based on the business records of the company once they became available to look at the effects of marketing different kinds of products to different target groups.

One of my papers was on marketing to

20 America's youth, evidence from corporate

documents.  You saw some of that yesterday.

I've done studies on the effects of people going to filtered and lower yield products, the effects of various aspects of marketing both in terms of promotion and price and how that

influences consumer behavior.

Several studies, you know, recently published in the last year looking at some of the price marketing that's going on and how that's influencing brand selection.

Q.  Was there evidence in the record � when I say "evidence in the record," I mean the case-specific record that you reviewed pertaining to Mary Cooper, that indicated that she saw cigarette advertising?

A.  Sure.  She talked about it in her deposition, and she talked about it when I interviewed her in terms of her exposure to cigarette advertising.

And she spoke very specifically about seeing, you know, advertisements on television, shows that were sponsored by cigarette

18 [manufacturers like RJ Reynolds

19           I think she mentioned The Flintstones

20 which was a show sponsored by Winston cigarettes

21 in the early 1960s.

22           And then The Beverly Hillbillies.

23 IWinston withdrew � Reynolds withdrew its

24 marketing of the Flintstones when it went to

25 Saturday syndication.

But when it first came out as a prime-time show, I think, you know, 7:30 in the evening, I remember watching it.

Q.  And so, based upon that, do you have an opinion � I think we're going to see some of the ads of the era, but do you have an opinion based upon that, based upon your education, research, training, experience, review of records and the case-specific record as to whether or not cigarette advertising had an impact on Mary Cooper's smoking?

MR. DAVIS:  Objection.  Invades the province of the jury.  Beyond the scope of expertise.

THE COURT:  Let's come sidebar, please.

(The following discussion was held sidebar:)

THE COURT:  Can you hear?

THE REPORTER:  Yes, thank you.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Jon, step right up here, please.  So just block the jury.

Okay.  So the first thing we should do is everybody should look at their watch.  This is 15 hours without a sidebar.  That's a miracle.

What is the witness going to say?

MR. BASS:  He's going to say that he believes, in his opinion, that cigarette advertising had an impact �

THE COURT:  Beyond that, what are you going to ask him?

MR. BASS:  I'm going to ask him to show some representative examples �

THE COURT:  That's okay.

MR. BASS:  � of cigarette advertising.

THE COURT:  State the legal basis of the objection.

MR. DAVIS:  The objection is that it invades the province of the jury.  He is not a psychiatrist.  He is not an expert in the mental state of mind or impact on any particular human being.  I did not object and �

THE COURT:  Okay.  Hang on.  The reason I'm over here, Mr. Bass, the way you phrased the question is it's just so open-ended:  Did it have an impact.  Did it influence her smoking?  Did it play a role in what brand she chose?

Maybe that's within his expertise, but when you say "did it have an impact," now you are

25 maybe stretching it into some psychological state

of mind type question.

I think you can ask this question.  I think you can lay a predicate.  I think you need to rephrase it exactly how you do it, but up here first.

MR. PEDROSA:  If I may be heard, Your Honor, what he's asking is, what did Mrs. Cooper say.  It's an expert opinion, as if Dr. Cummings has an ability to come to an independent psychological assessment of what happened in her

THE COURT:  I know that.  That's what I just said.

MR. PEDROSA:  All he can do is say, well, it �

MR. DAVIS:  And there's nothing in his notes that indicates any individual evaluation of what impact or effect or anything on her as a human.

He can do the broad picture of the amount of advertising, what specifically she said she saw.  Those are factual, and that's apparently within the scope that's been recognized of his expertise on the advertisement at the time.

But to start drawing down specific

opinions, whatever the verdict is, impact �

THE COURT:  Okay.  That's the same objection you made.

MR. DAVIS:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  I sustain the objection as to the word "impact."

How are you going to rephrase it so that we don't have to come back over here again?

MR. BASS:  I'm going to ask him, Your Honor, if he has an opinion as to how � I'm going to ask him whether he has an opinion as to whether cigarette advertising influenced Mary Cooper's smoking behaviors, and I'm going to ask him in what way did it influence her smoking behavior.

THE COURT:  And what do you anticipate the answer to be?

MR. BASS:  I anticipate the answer to be that it influenced her selection brand based upon the messages of the brands that she smoked, and that's what we're going to go through.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. BASS:  And I would say, Judge, you know, we're talking about mental status here, but Dr. Cummings is an expert in smoking behavior.

what you said over their objection, but you can't get into her state of mind.

You can say:  Based on the way � whatever she told him that she can rely upon as far as advertising, who knows whatever it was that she told him as far as being influenced by ads.

He can testify about that, but he can't testify as to her state of mind, and you're going to have to make sure that's clear as you ask him these two questions.

MR. DAVIS:  Well, just for the record, I understand your ruling.  If he is allowed to testify that the advertising affected her decision about brands, that is a comment on her state of

15 mind.

THE COURT:  Okay.  What do you want to say?  What else do you want to say?

MR. BASS:  Nothing.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I've made a ruling. That's my ruling.

MR. PEDROSA:  We will have to object when he asks the question.

THE COURT:  I don't know what he's going to ask, but I hope you do it the way we said it.

MR. DAVIS:  Can I make my objection now?

MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor.  May it please the Court?

MR. PEDROSA:  Same objection.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

You can answer.

and what is it based on?

A.  It's based on the fact that she commented that she saw lots of advertising.  She specifically commented on, in her deposition and also in her interview with me, that she selected the filters on cigarettes because she thought they were safer.

She named examples of advertising that she saw, but the most important factor related to reliance in advertising is the fact that you select certain brands of cigarettes, and she selected � you know, she had certain brands that she selected and used routinely.

And, you know, you just don't do that randomly.  You don't go in and buy � you could, just say:  Whatever is there, or you choose the cheapest one, but she smoked Belair and Salem and then Winston Menthol 100s when they came out and then Marlboro Menthol 100s.

These are popular brands.  If you actually track the brand histories, these were the popular brands of the menthol variety, and she was a menthol smoker during the time period that she smoked.

Improper comment on state of mind.  Move to strike.  Invades the province of the jury. THE COURT:  Objection overruled.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Dr. Cummings, were cigarette ads portrayed � did cigarette ads, rather, portray smoking as a young, fun, and healthy thing to do?

A.  Absolutely.  During the time that, you know, Mary Cooper was smoking, that was the way cigarette advertising portrayed smoking, in a very positive way, a lifestyle choice that was fun and healthy and acceptable to do.

Q.  Do we have a composite of ads that portray this?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And is that composite PT504?

A.  Right.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT504 as a composite and ask to publish just a few representative examples.

MR. PHILIPSON:  The other one is also on the top.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibits PT502 and PTASALM were received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Dr. Cummings, could you show us what we're looking at here, please, as a representative example?

A.  Sure.  I mean you can see the Lucky Strike ads.  Lucky Strike actually was a very popular cigarette right at the turn � 1950s, early '50s.

It was among the most popular cigarettes, obviously an unfiltered cigarette at that time.

And this is an ad talking about, you know:  Smoke Lucky to feel your level best.

And, you know, that was an example they always � you're showing somebody in a fun scene, in this case showing somebody swimming.

Q.  Did cigarette advertising ever show in this era someone with their larynx removed? A.  No, I've never seen an add �

MR. PEDROSA:  Objection. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I've never seen an ad for cigarettes showing somebody with their larynx removed.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Are there ads that ever showed the dangers or hazards of smoking at that particular time?

A.  Back in the '50s, '40s, '50s, no.

Q.  Now Ms. Cooper's first brand of cigarettes was Belair Menthol, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  And do you recall what time period she smoked those?

A.  Yeah, it was the early '60s, around 1962, I think she was getting them.  I think her brother got them from her father, and they were sneaking cigarettes at the time she was 11 or 12, was what I gleaned from the testimony and my interview.

Q.  Have we brought along an example of a Belair ad from that particular era?

A.  Yes.  This is the early '60s.  Belair didn't come out until 1960.  It promoted itself as a filter.

It actually had a recessed filter, so there was a little distance between the end of the filter tip, and the filter sort of overwrapped it a little bit by about a quarter inch.

And, you know, it was the idea of breathe easy, breathe clean, and that was the theme for Belair when it first came out, mild or light menthol.

Q.  Mild menthol, some of the themes we talked about yesterday as well, correct?

A.  Correct.  And this is a television ad, because advertising was very common.  So you'd see TV ads just like you do for products like Coke or Pepsi on television today.

You know, back in the '50s and '60s,

16 most of the advertising was for cigarettes, or

cars, I think, were the other common thing that was advertised on television.

Q.  Was mildness equated to inhalability?

A.  Yes, it was.  I mean making it less harsh and easy to inhale, that was one of the benefits of menthol, which is why it was more attractive to young people and also to women who were taking up smoking in larger numbers in this time period.

with new Belair.

(Video clip concluded.)

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Now, Dr. Cummings, certainly � well, first of all, this ad was in black and white, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Which takes us back in time quite a ways, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And seeing it now 50, 60 years later, is it hard to imagine the type of impact that advertising had on folks like Mary Cooper?

A.  It's not hard to imagine.  That ad is promoting that product as something that's, you know, clean and fresh.

You can see the water.  You often see that, water around scenes with menthol because it reinforces the idea that it's cooling and refreshing.

And menthol cigarettes were growing at this time.  So this was very successful, this campaign, you know, for Belair.  It became not the

23 most popular brand from Brown & Williamson, but it

did grow in this time period.

And so these kinds of ads were

effective.

Q.  And messages like cleaner smoke, smoke clean, what's the impact of that message or theme on smokers like Mary Cooper?

MR. BELASIC:  Object.  Beyond the scope, Your Honor, of the expertise.

MR. DAVIS:  And, again, state of mind. Improper state of mind, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Rephrase, Mr. Bass.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Have you studied the impact of that type of message on the smoking public at that particular time?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And do you have an opinion as to the type of impact of that message, clean smoke, smoke cleaner, on the smoking public and environment at that particular time?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  And what is that opinion?

A.  You have no words, and there was really no � you know, there wasn't that much information coming out.  When you see these kinds of ads, they sort of allay any concerns you might have about smoking.

And, in fact, Mary Cooper said in her

interview when she started smoking she hadn't heard about the health effects of smoking; it wasn't a concern to her.

And, you know, you see an ad like that, no worries.

Q.  Why is inhalability of a cigarette so important, Dr. Cummings?

A.  It relates directly to making the product highly addictive.

Q.  Were healthcare professionals also used in advertisements of that era?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  And do we have � like before, we have composite exhibits that we're going to move into evidence, and do we have a couple of representative ads to show the jury?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And that is PT500.

MR. BASS:  At this time, we'd offer PT500 into evidence.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT500 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  And if you could tell us what we're looking at here, please, Dr. Cummings.

A.  Well, this is just a composite of different print ads appearing in magazines, you know, like Life and Look and Saturday Evening Post.

Those were a lot of popular places for these types of ads.  From the '30s to '40s and into the '50s, you saw many advertisements, the fact that doctors are health professionals, would select that brand.

"More Doctors Smoke Camels" was a common theme of an advertising campaign that went from the late '40s into the '50s.  Half of doctors were smokers, and they often would provide at the doctor's conventions, their medical conventions, the booths where you could get the free cigarettes, and they'd sponsor a lounge for the doctors and so on, advertised in medical journals.

So I'm giving you an idea of the culture of what it was like to grow up in that era.  So that's just examples of the advertising.

And health-themed advertising, particularly in the '50s, was important because it sort of countered the beginning information that was beginning to leak out on the harmful effects of smoking in the popular media.

Q.  Have you studied and researched the impact of using doctors in advertisements on the smoking culture and environment of that era?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And what is the impact?

A.  Well, the impact is that these � the ads that touted the health benefits of smoking, milder smoke, smoked by doctors, was very successful according to RJ Reynolds' own internal business records, the campaign for "More Doctors Smoke Camels" was highly successful.

Q.  You might have mentioned this.  Besides print ads, did cigarette companies advertise on television particularly using healthcare professionals?

A.  They did.

Q.  Okay.  And have we brought along a representative television ad regarding the use of healthcare professionals in cigarette advertising?

A. Yes. This is the "More Doctors Smoke Camels" clip. I think this particular clip is 1949, so early television, but it went through 1951.

The campaign was created by William Esty Corporation, the advertising firm for Reynolds,

and they left free cartons of cigarettes in the rooms of the doctors going to the medical convention up in New York.

And then they waited a day as the doctors used up their regular brand and sat down and said:  Doctor, what brand did you have today?

More doctors smoke Camel than any other brand, and they turned it into an advertising campaign.

Q.  And is that PT543A? A.  Yes.

MR. BASS:  At this time, we'd offer PT543A into evidence, Your Honor.

in every state of the union, doctors in every branch of medicine were asked:  What cigarette do you smoke, Doctor?

In this nationwide survey of general practitioners, surgeons, throat specialists, diagnosticians, and so on, the brand named most was Camel.

Yes, according to this survey, more doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette.

Try Camels yourself.  Make the one sensible cigarette test.  Take your own 30-day Camel mildness test in your "T" zone.  Smoke only Camels for 30 days.

Enjoy Camel's rich, full flavor and see how well Camels agree with your throat, pack after pack, week after week, see for yourself why Camels are so popular with the doctors of America.

(Video clip concluded.) Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Dr. Cummings, remind us what impact this had on the smoking environment and the smoking culture of that era.

A.  Well, the impact is that it was endorsed by your doctor.  So that was a good thing, and there was no worries about cigarette smoking.

out � and there was some that was beginning to come out in popular press about the health risks of smoking in the early '50s � it just sort of turned that off.

If your doctors are smoking, why would you have to worry about it, and it was a successful campaign.

In fact, it was mimicked by all the other cigarette companies.  They all had campaigns targeting doctors and promoting health aspects of smoking.

You know, Lorillard used scientists and educators to market their cigarettes in the '50s.

You know, Brown & Williamson used doctors for Viceroy, you know, more filter traps in the Viceroy filter promoted by doctors, dentists, nurses.  It was very common.

Q.  Are you familiar with an ad campaign by Philip Morris called "Do You Inhale?"

A.  Yes.

Q.  And tell us about that campaign, please, Dr. Cummings.

A.  Well, this is in the 1940s where they talked about the fact that Philip Morris, with its finest tobaccos, you know, were milder and easier

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=330
1538

1 to inhale.

2           And they actually teach as part of the

3 advertisement, you know, how to inhale the

4 cigarettes, and this is a clip that you might see

5 if you went to the movies.

6           They used to have little Johnny

7 Roventini, the "Call for Philip Morris" guy.  He

8 would travel around to movie theatres, became the

9 most popular known spokesperson for any product.

10           He was pitching Philip Morris cigarettes

11 at the time, and this was the ad, "Do You Inhale?"

12 that you would see during that time period in the

13 late 1940s.

14      Q.  And is that PT588A?

15      A.  Yes.

Philip Morris.  Take a puff.  Get a good mouthful of smoke and slowly let the smoke come directly through your nose.

Now light up your present brand and do exactly the same thing.  Take a puff.  Get a good

directly through your nose.  Notice any difference?

VOICE:  Yes, but Philip Morris is so

burning.

VOICE:  That's irritation, and, remember, the irritation you felt in your nose is the same irritation that occurs in your throat every time you inhale your own brand.

So enjoy Philip Morris, the one cigarette proved definitely less irritating, definitely milder than any other leading brand.

Do you inhale?  Then you certainly should.

VOICE:  Call for Philip Morris.

(Video clip concluded.) Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Again, we see the notion of inhalability, Doctor, and why would cigarette advertisements stress the importance of

6 more likely to become a regular smoker.

inhalability of a cigarette?

A.  Well, inhalability is critical in terms of addiction.  They weren't touting this as addictive, but if you can get it into your lungs, the companies knew that they were more � you were

And of course they were touting their brand as milder than their competitor's brand.  So this is a type of marketing that you would see to try to get people to buy that product.

And people who did buy a particular brand were buying into the message, the advertising message for that brand.  That's the purpose of advertising.

And of course smokers who picked different brands relied on those brands, would rely on the messaging that they're getting.

Q.  What's a filtered cigarette, Dr. Cummings?

A.  Well, a filtered cigarette is one where you take a 70 millimeter and you just sit on a little plug of cellulose acetate filters.

But this is � the cellulose acetate filter is the one that became popular, and there is a little wrapping or tipping paper that goes

around to hold the fibers together, and they became popular.

The first cellulose acetate filter was 1952.  That was Viceroy, and then a number of other companies started to market filtered cigarettes.

I think Kent came out with a filtered cigarette in 1952.  That was Kent, the Micronite filter.

And then you had Marlboro, Winston, Salem.  These were all filtered cigarettes, and this corresponds to when more information was coming out about the health risks of smoking.

So if you had any concerns whatsoever, you know, switch to a filtered cigarette.

Q.  What was the advertising messages conveyed by filtered cigarette advertising?

A.  You can get the good taste of a cigarette in a filtered cigarette.  So, you know, it takes out some things, but you still get the good taste, and so that was the main theme.

So it was sort of a health theme. People who smoked the filtered cigarettes thought they were getting a safer product, they were getting less of the irritation or tar, nicotine,

cancer.  That's still a belief that many people hold today.

Q.  When were � I think you said it was introduced � became popular in the early 1950s

in, say, 1952, I think you said with the introduction of Viceroy and Kent?

A.  Less than two percent of the cigarettes sold in the early '50s, 1952 period were filtered.

By the end of the '50s, that had shifted dramatically where you had about 60 percent of the

13 market in the filtered category.

And women and young people are the ones that went to the new filtered cigarettes.

Q.  What's the market share today of filtered cigarettes?

A.  About 99 percent.  So almost everybody who smokes today is smoking filtered cigarettes. Even with roll-your-own cigarettes today, they usually sell them with little kits that you can stick a filter on it.

Q.  Did Mary Cooper smoke filtered cigarettes?

A.  We do, yes.

Q.  And is that PT498B?

A.  Yes.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer 498B into evidence.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT498B was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Can you tell us what we're looking auto here, please, Dr. Cummings?

A.  Again, these are ads primarily from the '50s talking about the new filtered cigarettes. You know, you can see Winston and Marlboro.

You saw an old Marlboro ad previously. That was the early '50s because it was really primarily marketed as a women's cigarette, but in 1954, they recreated Marlboro and put it in the flip-top box and stuck a filter on it.

And so these ads are for Marlboro and

in the 1950s.  I mentioned Kent and the Micronite filter.  And the Viceroy filter traps.

Q.  I'm sorry to interrupt.  Let's blow up the Viceroy filter traps, if we could, Dr. Cummings, while you're talking about it �

A.  Sure.

Q.  � so that maybe the jury can see that.

MR. PHILIPSON:  They're not going to see it from there.

MR. BASS:  Okay.  No, that's okay. That's all right.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  If you could just read us the headline there, Dr. Cummings, on the Viceroy ad.

A.  Sure.

Only Viceroy gives you 20,000 filter traps for that smoother taste.

Q.  Used to imply what?

A.  Well, it's milder, smoother, less harsh, and it's trapping stuff that would be the irritation in the cigarettes, in other words, the tar particles and so on in the product.

So that was � there were all kinds of little gimmicks like Micronite. There's no such thing as Micronite.  That was just an advertising

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=337

1545

term used by Kent cigarettes or Lorillard in their

2 marketing, the Micronite filter.

3           Essentially when they went to filters

4 they changed the blend of the product.  So you had

5 the filter blend, and the filter blend actually

6 had more tar and nicotine in it.

7           So actually many of the filtered

8 cigarettes, when they first came out, actually had

9 more tar and nicotine than the unfiltered

10 cigarettes.

11           And over time, the introduction of the

12 filter in the early '50s, when you come out and

13 you look at products like Winston or Salem and so

14 on, the early tar numbers � there was no

15 government requirement, but they would tout the

16 tar and nicotine numbers of their product.

17           They started to loosen the fibers.  So

18 you would get more stuff coming through.  They

19 didn't tell people they were loosening them.

20           So the numbers started to creep up

21 because tar is taste in a cigarette, and so if you

22 actually had a filter that reduced a lot of tar

23 coming through, you'd get a lot of the gas but no

24 taste.

25           And so they added stronger tobacco, more

pgNbr=338
10 more carcinogenic by RJ Reynolds' own assessment.

11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23

25

1546

burley tobacco to the product, and the burley tobacco had more nicotine and also a stronger taste and also introduced smokers to more of the carcinogens.

Nitrosamines were higher in burley tobacco, and so the filter blend that was used was actually more carcinogenic.

If you look at the Winston cigarette versus Camel, it was two and a half more times

They never told anybody that.  They talked about the filter blend and the pure white filter.

MR. PEDROSA:  Objection to the narrative, Judge.  Move to strike.

THE COURT:  I think he exceeded the question a little bit.

Try to stay focused again, Dr. Cummings, on the next question, please.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Have there been changes to filtered cigarettes over the years? A.  Yes, many. Q.  And do you have an opinion � well, let

24 me ask you this:  Do filtered cigarettes work?

A.  No.  They work to sell cigarettes

obviously because they went from hardly anybody smoking a filtered cigarette to just about everybody smoking a filtered cigarette.

But in terms of working to lower disease risk, no.

Q.  And what do you mean by that, working in terms of � not working to lower disease risk?

A.  As the evidence began to come out, particularly in the '50s and '60s, about how dangerous smoking was, I mean people switched to the filtered cigarettes, or if they were taking up smoking, they pretty much went to the filtered cigarettes to start with under the illusion that it was safer and, in other words, less likely to cause disease that was being discussed.

And now when we look 50 years back at the people who smoked the unfiltered cigarettes versus the filtered cigarettes and the low-tar cigarettes, which sort of came later � they were just filtered cigarettes with vent holes stuck in the filter to give lower tar and nicotine numbers � the relative risk for diseases like cancer and COPD and heart disease went up.

So the risk of cigarette smoking today is higher.  Cigarettes are more dangerous on the

shelf today, and it relates to changes in the design, the filter being one.

There are a lot of other things, because when they changed the filter, they changed the blend.  They started using more additives, but the product today is more dangerous.

Q.  We know that Mary Cooper smoked menthols, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  And have we brought along some representative menthol ads of the brands of cigarettes that she smoked throughout her life?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And is that PT503N?

A.  Yes.

MR. PHILIPSON:  Actually it's a composite.

MR. BASS:  Do they have different numbers?

And, Your Honor, just for the record, and I apologize, Your Honor, for the silence there, but I miscalled the PT number.  It's actually a PT composite of PTAVSalem, PTAVKool, PTAVMarlboro, and PTANewport.

MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor.

MR. PHILIPSON:  You guys can see it,

right?

MR. BASS:  If we could publish that. Thank you. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  We've spoken a lot about

10 pmenthol advertising.  If you could just tell us

11 what brands we have here, the ads that we're

12 looking at

13      A.  Sure.  Again, you've got a couple of

14 Salem ads.  Again, the springtime freshness was

15 one of their main advertising themes with the

16 green and white coloring, prominent in their

17 marketing, again, reinforcing the fact of the

18 pmenthol and cleaner, fresh taste of Salem.  I

19 believe these are in the 1960s.

20      Q.  And what other brands are up there,

21 Doctor?

22      A.  You've got Winston Menthol, a specific

23 campaign.  I think they created a brand variant or

24 line extension of Winston which had just been a

25 regular cigarette in the late 1960s.  Around 1967

13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1550

they introduced Winston Menthol which went for about a decade or so until they discontinued it.

You have Newport.  This is an earlier version of the Newport.  So from the '60s, I believe.  "Smoke Fresher."

And then in the '70s, actually '69, they switched over their campaign to "Alive With Pleasure."  That was the Newport campaign.

And then you have some ads for Kool and Salem and Marlboro, Marlboro Menthol Lights. Q.  And Marlboro Menthol Lights, did

A.  Yes.  That was, from my assessment of the material that I reviewed, including my interview, it was the mid 1990s, around 1995 she started smoking Marlboro Menthol Lights.

And, again, you can see the colors, the bright colors, usually green and white, or, in this case, the water, the smaller chevron and the big Marlboro chevron that you have on regular cigarettes.

So on the light cigarettes, the chevron was, in this case, green and made smaller, more white space on the pack.  That's to connote, reinforce the notion you were getting something

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=343
10 main difference is the addition of filter vents or

11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1551

less, light.

And that was studied by Philip Morris, because they knew how consumers were perceiving the packaging and their marketing.

Q.  What's the difference between a filtered cigarette and a light cigarette?

A.  There's not a difference really.  I mean there are filtered cigarettes.  The way they created light cigarettes, for the most part, the

little air holes that are lasered into the filter.

With many of the menthol brands, the filter is a white color versus cork.  You know, a regular cigarette often uses a cork colored tip to the filter.

But a lot of menthol cigarettes, particularly the light ones, use white, again, to reinforce the notion that it's somehow cleaner.

And you can't really see the vent holes unless you take the tipping paper off and put it under a microscope or get a flashlight.

And then the vent holes appear, and when you have vent holes in the filter, it reduce resistance to draw.  So it just makes it easier to take a bigger, deeper puff.

So it's an engineering feature that actually is built into the cigarette to make it easier to draw the smoke deeper into the airway. Q.  And do we have a demonstrative that you can show the jury what you're talking about, the filter ventilation? A.  Yes.

Q.  And, Dr. Cummings, can you tell us what we're looking at here, please?

A.  Well, those are � we stripped out the tobacco and the filter, and it's just looking at the Salem cigarette, and you can see the ring of vent holes in the Salem Menthol today.

Now, over time, the size of these vent holes or whether there was venting in the filter at all changed.

They didn't advertise it to consumers, but they would change over time.  Their products were always being tweaked and modified in ways that people did not know except for the companies.

But you can see the filter vents there. There's a single row.  You know, with Marlboro Lights, for example, you get a double row of vent holes.  With Marlboro regular, it's a single row.

So it's just extra ventilation.  Again,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=345
5 measure on computers.  We have them smoke into a

6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1553

that allows the person to adjust, because of lower resistance to draw, more precisely their smoking. Now they don't consciously know they do this, but we know that they do it because we

little machine and measure very precisely how they're smoking.

And they essentially are just going to get the same amount of stuff out of the cigarettes, the same exposure to the toxins, and the same amount of nicotine because it makes it easier to smoke it.

Q.  Thank you, Dr. Cummings.

THE COURT:  Five more minutes, Mr. Bass, we'll take our morning break, please. MR. BASS:  Yes, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Thank you.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Was there evidence in the record that you saw whether � answering the question of whether or not Mary Cooper saw light cigarette advertising?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And what was the evidence in that regard?

A.  Yeah, she said she saw advertising for

16 17 18 19

21 22 23 24 25

1554

filtered and light cigarettes, and obviously she smoked filtered and light cigarettes.

So when you say you buy a pack of cigarettes, you get that message right on the pack.  The pack is part of the advertising

So every time you buy a pack, you're getting an ad.  It doesn't come in an uncolored box.  The package is part of the ad.

Q.  Are light cigarettes any safer, Dr. Cummings?

A.  No.  It turns out the dilution holes � so the answer is no.  The dilution holes, those little air holes, actually, because you get oxygen

15 mixing with some of the 7,000 chemicals and known

carcinogens that are coming through, increases the likelihood of mutagenicity.

In other words, if you do an assay, a little test on bacteria, for example, you can show

20 more cell damage with the tar from an air-vented

cigarette.

So the more ventilation, the more carcinogenic, potentially more mutagenetic, the tar.

And that's something the companies were

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Do light cigarettes prevent any diseases, cigarette-related diseases, rather?

A.  No.

Q.  Do they increase disease risk?

A.  That's what the evidence is showing us based on the laboratory studies, or mutagenic tar, as well as the human epidemiologic studies with over two million smokers who have been tracked over 50 years.

smoking of unfiltered cigarettes with those who were recruited in the 1950s � or 1980s who smoked almost exclusively filtered and low-tar cigarettes, their relative risk went up.

For women, it doubled for diseases like, you know, cancer � actually for men, it doubled. For women, it tripled.

Actually women went up a lot higher because they were the first to go to filtered and then the light cigarettes.

Q.  What is the Federal Trade Commission, Dr. Cummings?

A.  The federal agency that regulates trade and advertising in this country.

Q.  And are you familiar with Federal Trade Commission reports regarding cigarette advertising?

A.  Yes.  Congress passed a law.  I believe the law was passed in 1965 mandating that the Federal Trade Commission put out an annual report on cigarette advertising, and that began in 1967.

Q.  And are you familiar with the first Federal Trade Commission report to Congress pursuant to that Act June 30, 1967?

A.  Yes.  It talks about overall exposure to

for filtered cigarettes that was occurring at this time and what the effect of that was on consumers. It talks about sponsorship of TV shows and so on.

This is, again, in 1967.  So it's really covering the period of the mid 1960s.

Q.  And the first � Page 8, the first thing that we're going to talk about, the effectiveness, did this report address the effectiveness of cigarette labeling?

A.  Yeah.  Yes, it did.  In fact, this report looked at the effect of the new warning label that had appeared on cigarettes in 1966, the caution label, you know:  Caution:  Cigarette smoking may be harmful to your health.

And that had appeared in 1966, and it evaluated whether that warning had been effective or not.

Q.  And let's see what the � if you could read to us what the FTC wrote here, please, Dr. Cummings.

A.  There is virtually no evidence that the warning statement on cigarette packages has had

any significant effect.
	

If cigarette sales are viewed as an
	

index of the effectiveness of the warning
	

statement, one finds that in 1966, more cigarettes
	

were sold than ever before.
	

Even during January and February 1966,
	

the first two months that the warning appeared on
	

cigarette packages, cigarette sales were higher
	

than they had been during the same months of the
	

preceding year.
	

MR. BELASIC:  For the rule of the
	

completeness, Your Honor, may we read the next
	

sentence?
	

THE COURT:  You may.
	

MR. BASS:  Just the next sentence after
	

that?
	

MR. BELASIC:  Yes.
	

MR. BASS:  Okay.
	

Of course there is no way of knowing how
	

many cigarettes might have been sold in the
	

absence of the warning, yet the inadequacy of the
	

warning statement becomes clear by comparing the
	

sharp drop in cigarette sales following
	

publication of the Surgeon General's report with
	

the continuing rise in sales after the warning

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Did I read that full paragraph, Dr. Cummings?

A.  You did.

Q.  The beginning of the last sentence, "the inadequacy of the warning," what is that referring to?

A.  It's referring to the caution label that had appeared on cigarette packs, and basically it's not having any impact on cigarette sales.

Q.  Did this � did this also address something that we have talked about earlier, this report, the different lengths of cigarettes, 85

14 millimeters, 100 millimeters?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And is that on the next page we're going to look at?

A.  Yes.

Q.  The most recent trend has been the extension of several existing brands into the extra long 100 millimeter length type of cigarette.

This has resulted from the success in 1966 of the extra long Benson & Hedges and Pall

25 Malls.

This trend is of a serious and disturbing nature since these extra long cigarettes also expose the smoker to greater amounts of tar and nicotine, making them potentially more hazardous than the shorter length cigarettes.

Did I read that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  What's the evidence with respect to the length of cigarette that Mary Cooper smoked in her life?

A.  Well, during part of her life, she was smoking 100s.

Q.  Now not only does the longer cigarette provide more exposures to hazard, but does it also provide more exposures to nicotine?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And what is the impact of more exposures to nicotine?

A.  Well, there's just more nicotine that can be extracted in the product to keep a person hooked.

So if there's more there, it's easier to extract.  You know, people smoke for their daily dose of nicotine.

So even going from 100 to a regular, people are going to just smoke the cigarette to get their daily � you know, their dose of nicotine, and what comes along is the tar, and the tar is what causes the disease.

Q.  Did this report also discuss the reach of cigarette advertisements?

A.  Yes, it does.

Q.  Okay.  And that's on the next page?

A.  Correct.

Q.  If you could read � read the first three highlighted sections, please, Dr. Cummings?

A.  Sure.

It says:  Cigarette advertising reaches virtually all Americans who can either read or understand the spoken word.

So pervasive is cigarette advertising that it is virtually impossible for Americans of almost any age to avoid cigarette advertising.

Many of the daytime and evening television programs are sponsored by cigarette

22 manufacturers, and numerous magazines and

newspapers read by the whole family contain cigarette advertising.

As stated above, youth is also exposed

to cigarette advertising.  During the week of January 11th, 1967, the aforementioned 60 network programs (sponsored in whole or in part by cigarette products) played before 322.7 million viewers who were under 21 years of age.  These included 151.1 million viewers aged 2 to 12 and 141 million viewers aged 13 to 17.

Q.  Were The Flintstones an example of a show that was either sponsored or showed cigarettes in them?

A.  Yes.  In the early 1960s, as I said, when it came out, you know, at 7:30 � I think their initial launch was at 8:30, but then they became a prime-time at 7:30 in the evening, it was sponsored by Winston cigarettes, and then when they went to syndication for Saturday morning, that was pulled.

Q.  Was there evidence in the record that

19 Mary Cooper watched The Flintstones?

A.  Yes.

MR. BASS: Your Honor, at this time we'd offer PT570A into evidence.

(Video clip concluded.) Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Dr. Cummings, did the FTC report also discuss the impact of advertising on youth?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Is that the next page of the FTC report we're going to look at? A.  Yes.

Q.  It says:  Now due in part to the cumulative effect of cigarette advertising over the years, advertising that shows cigarette

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=362
10 meaningful way, many teenagers take up the smoking

17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24

smoking to be an enjoyable and pleasurable activity and ignores the suffering and early death that it causes, many youngsters consider cigarette smoking to be an acceptable and socially desirable activity.

They tend to view cigarette smoking as a visible mark of maturity, a passport to adulthood. Because the health dangers of cigarette smoking are not brought home to them in an effective and

habit.

Did I read that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Let me ask you about the cumulative effect of cigarette advertising over the years.

16 What does that mean?

A.  Well, just as you grow up, it was normal in this time period that you would see advertising just about every place you would go.

You'd go into a store and you would see advertising.  It was on television, on the radio, on the newspaper, in the funny pages.  It was everywhere.  You could not escape it.

And so it normalized it, and of course

25 many adults, the smoking prevalence in the mid

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=363
6 many young people to grow up and sort of become a

1571

1960s was about 44 percent of 18 and older who were smoking.

So it was just sort of common to see, and it was a normal thing.  It was a lifestyle thing, and, as they say, a right of passage for

smoker and signify that they moved from being a youngster into adulthood.

Q.  Did this report also, in part, discuss filter cigarettes?

A.  Yes, because filtered cigarettes had become the predominant type of cigarette being sold, and most of the advertising, about three-fourths of the advertising at this time in the '60s had been for the filtered cigarettes.

So that's what was really being pushed, as unfiltereds were sort of falling out of favor.

Q.  And do we see that, references on the next page that we're going to look at?

A.  Yes.

Q.  It's a long one, so I'll volunteer to read it.

Assuaging anxiety � let me ask you about that before we launch into reading it.

1572

A.  Assuaging anxiety, reducing or addressing, mitigating the anxiety that people

is the health risks of smoking.

So if you had any worries about it, these were reduced because of the marketing of filtered cigarettes that promised a safer cigarette, and that's exactly why smokers went to them.

Q.  During 1957 to 1959, the theme that filter cigarettes substantially reduce the tar and nicotine content of cigarette smoke was promoted extensively.

It has been stated that this promotional campaign, termed the "tar derby," coupled with concern over the hazards of smoking suggested that the mere addition of a filter to a cigarette is, in and of itself, some kind of claim or assurance relating to the health aspects of smoking.

The belief appears to be widely held that filter cigarettes are less hazardous to health than regular cigarettes.

A recent study by the Roswell Park

25 Memorial Institute indicates, however, that many

of the most popular brands of filter cigarettes contain as much or more tar and nicotine as many brands of nonfilter cigarettes.

Let me stop there and ask you:  So even before you went to Roswell Park, Roswell Park had been involved in studying cigarettes and smoking behavior?

A.  Yes.  Roswell Park, the scientists there were among the first to publish some of the data on the health risks of smoking back in the early 1950s and then continued to look at what was in the cigarettes.

They developed their own machinery for testing cigarettes and comparing the tar and nicotine content of the products, Fred Bock and Dr. Vincent and others at Roswell, George Moore who was the head of the Cancer Center at the time. It was a major area of our research, and when I went to Roswell Park Cancer Institute in the 1980s, I basically picked up where Fred Bock � he had retired.  He was the scientist who was doing research on the tar and nicotine.

Q.  It references "tar derby."  What is that a reference to?

A.  Well, in the 1950s and particularly with

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=366
10 marketing going on making claims that their

11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1574

the introduction of filtered cigarettes, the companies were touting their brands as being lower in tar and nicotine and, you know, making claims.

And of course their testing wasn't any standardized way of testing, which is why standardized testing of products actually came in through the federal government, through the Federal Trade Commission in the late 1960s.

But the tar derby was really this wild

product, the filter was better than their competitors', and it got labeled the "tar derby." Q.  It goes on to say:  The public's concern over the health hazard and its belief that filter cigarettes minimize that hazard is evidenced by the increasing sales of filter cigarettes as compared to nonfilter cigarettes.

Between 1963 and 1966, the market share held by filter cigarettes jumped from 58 percent to 68 percent.

And in 1964, when cigarette sales declined by about 10.7 billion, the sales of regular cigarettes dropped 20 billion while filter cigarette sales increased almost 10 billion.

A.  Yes.

Q.  The first sentence regarding the public's concern over the health hazard and its belief that filter cigarettes minimized that hazard, was that a mistaken belief regarding the effectiveness of filters?

A.  Yes.  It was a mistaken belief because we now know that the filters really offered no benefit.

And, in fact, the smokers didn't realize that many � even at this time, many of the filtered cigarettes would deliver as much tar or

13 more tar and nicotine than the unfiltered ones.

Q.  And the last portion, I think we touched on this, we've talked about some of the themes of advertising pertaining to Mary Cooper, and then we talked about some of the themes that cigarette advertisements never show, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Does the FTC report � does this FTC report discuss that concept?

A.  Yes.

A.  Yes.

Q.  What does that mean?

A.  Well, that it's not a choice, that it's a need, although if you read the next thing in parentheses, even here, the FTC is unclear as to whether this is a physiological addiction or whether it's merely a psychological, more of a habit.

And that is due, we now know, to the fact that companies didn't reveal the information they had about the product being addictive.

Q.  So in 1967, the federal government wasn't aware of that?

A.  Well, they were confused about it.  They didn't have solid evidence themselves because some of that evidence that existed within the company business records was never turned over to them.

Q.  Were the cigarette companies confused in 1967 about the addictiveness of nicotine?

A.  No.

Q.  And what do you base that opinion on?

A.  Their own internal business records. They clearly recognized that they were in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug. They had done very detailed studies on the addictiveness of their product as a physiological addiction, not a psychological addiction.

And their knowledge, by their own admission, was much greater in their internal understanding than what was in the published literature.

So while you could find articles in the published literature talking about this, their knowledge was much deeper, and they used that knowledge to engineer their products.

Q.  It goes on to say:  After the Surgeon General's report was published, cigarette clinics (some similar to Alcoholics Anonymous) were formed throughout the country to help people stop smoking, yet most of them have now been dissolved because of the poor results.

Advertisements for cigarettes never show this side of smoking.  They never show an habituated cigarette smoker with a hacking cough, groping for a cigarette upon awakening in the

They never suggest the tension felt by a chain-smoker when he runs out of cigarette.  In terms of public understanding of the health hazards, knowledge of this aspect of smoking is essential.

Only when one realizes that cigarette smoking cannot automatically be stopped and started at will can he fully understand how dangerous it is even to start.

In making a decision on whether to start smoking, youngsters especially have a right to know that once they start, they may never be able to stop.  A viewer of cigarette commercials and advertisements would never hear of this aspect of smoking.

Did I read that right? A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you found, in your experience discussing and treating smokers, that understanding these types of things is important

to them?

A.  Sure.  We've done surveys primarily of teenagers.  There's a whole Institute of Medicine report on nicotine addiction and youth that I participated in 1994 that addressed this very issue, that most young people, when they started experimenting with smoking, never thought they would be smoking five years later down the line.

But when you followed those young people, many of them were not only smoking but they were smoking more because they had more money in their pocket to spend on cigarettes.

And once you get hooked, it's hard to get off, and most young people don't perceive themselves as � you know, they're smoking this weekend.  They're not thinking about what's going to happen five years later or ten years or thirty years.

Q.  Are you familiar with the 1981 FTC report regarding cigarette advertisements?

A.  I am.

Q.  And is that, like the 1967 report,

23 mandated by Congress that FTC produce a report on

cigarette advertisements?

A.  It is.  The '81 report was unique,

however, because it was a much more extensive review about what the public knew and believed about smoking, their exposure to cigarette

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  And is this the front page, Dr. Cummings?

A.  Yes, it is.

Q.  All right.  Again, as you say, like the '67 report, it's a comprehensive report that addresses different topics under the theme of cigarette advertisements, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Did this report address the amount of cigarette advertisements � excuse me, did this report address the amount of cigarette advertising in the United States?

A.  Yes.

MR. BASS:  If we could look at that page, please, Robert.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  If you could read that to us, please, Dr. Cummings. A.  Sure.

The amount of cigarette advertising in the United States.  Cigarettes are the most heavily advertised product in America.  It has been estimated that the six major cigarette companies spent $1 billion in 1980 to sell their products.

This figure is several hundred times greater than the amount the government spends on public service announcements on smoking hazards.

The National Commission on Smoking and Public Policy reported in 1978, that the tobacco industry spent more on advertising cigarettes in one day then the then National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health, the government's primary agency working in this area, spent in one year.

Cigarette advertising expenditures have grown substantially over the last decade and continue to grow.

Q.  What is the National Clearing � then, what was the National Clearinghouse on Smoking and

Health?

A.  That was the office that was designated to educate the public about the risks of smoking, and they were responsible at this time for putting out the annual Surgeon General's reports on smoking and health.

Q.  And so � well, it might be obvious, what was � that office's goal, the office of the Surgeon General's goal in disseminating information on smoking and health?

A.  To make sure people were fully informed about the health risks of smoking.  So that was their primary goal.

Q.  When did cigarette advertising stop?

A.  Well, it hasn't stopped.  Cigarette companies are still spending I think the last report was $8 billion a year.

So it's never stopped, but it has changed the venues where you can market.  So, for example, television and radio, broadcast advertising of cigarettes ended in 1971.

So what happened is the companies merely shifted their advertising dollars to magazines, billboards.  In fact, this report says 75 � or 50 percent of all billboards in America were run by

THE COURT:  Okay.  What purpose is it being offered?

MR. BASS: Judge, she was smoking cigarettes in 2000 still, and so it's being offered to show �

THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry, Mr. Bass.

MR. BASS:  � the breath and the depth of advertising Dr. Cummings talked about, 250 billion was spent in 1940 to 2005.  That's in this time period, and Ms. Cooper is still smoking at this time.

MR. DAVIS:  I actually don't think he's testified to that yet, and we've got an issue with it, but that's very different � this ad � she never smoked this brand and it's 2000.

MR. GDANSKI:  She did smoke this brand.

but I'm not going to let you go any further on this topic.

MR. DAVIS:  I've got an issue on a document coming up that they were good enough to flag that is exactly on the advertising point. Maybe we should just cover it.

THE COURT:  Yes, let's cover it.  Where is it?

MR. DAVIS:  They are proposing to offer an excerpt from the 2010 Surgeon General's report. The only thing that was offered and allowed in Banks was from the preface, otherwise, it was redacted.

They're offering a page from 654 that contains the overall advertising expenditure up through I think 2010 or 20 � now, Your Honor, all of this, this whole advertising stuff is � there is nothing actionable about advertising since 1969.

It is preempted, and what's being done here is that they're putting these huge numbers in front of the jury that is saying:  Look what they're doing.  They're advertising.  They're

advertising.

It was legal.  It is not actionable.  It is preempted.  I know you have dealt with that in instructions, but it's a long way down the road, and, particularly, with the 2010 report, this is getting out of hand.

THE COURT:  I want to see what they want to show on the 2010.  So hand it up.  I doubt I'll let it in.  I'll let him have this one ad on this one topic and that's it.  Okay.

Q.  And is that discussed on the next page?

A.  Yes.

Q.  It says:  In the ensuing 16 years, there has been little change in the character of cigarette advertising.  Cigarette ads have continued to attempt to allay anxiety about the hazards of smoking and to associate smoking with good health, youthful vigor, social, and professional success, and other attractive ideas, individuals and activities that are both worthy of emulation and distant from concerns relative to health.

Most cigarettes advertisements express at least one of these themes.  Often more than one such theme can be found in a single advertisement. Thus, the cigarette is portrayed as an integral part of youth, happiness, attractiveness, personal

Did I read that right? A.  Yes.

Q.  Same theme in advertising that we saw continuing up until 1980, 1981? A.  Right.

MR. PHILIPSON:  What's the ending number, 85?

claim that cigarette smoking has affirmative health benefits, they continue to argue that it has not been proven that smoking has any detrimental health effects.

completeness, Your Honor.  Can we read the next two sentences?

THE COURT:  You may.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  We'll go ahead and read the whole paragraph.

A.  Would you like me to read it?

Q.  Oh, okay.  Thank you.

A.  Sure.  The tobacco industry makes four general arguments in support of its position. They are epidemiological evidence which establishes a correlation between smoking and the incidence of a disease, cannot be used to establish a causal link between smoking and that disease no matter how strong the epidemiologic evidence.

2, that smoking cannot be identified as a cause of a particular disease without a full understanding of how that disease developed and the specific agent in cigarette smoke that leads to its development, disease etiology.

And, 3, unidentified individuals constitutional differences between smokers and nonsmokers, and not smoking itself, explains why smokers suffer from certain diseases more often than nonsmokers.

And, 4, all of the studies which have been used to establish a link between smoking and health are flawed in design or methodology.

Q.  Now what we just read there, the tobacco industry's four general arguments in support of their position, we're going to talk about the conspiracy campaign of doubt later on in the afternoon, but this is a good time to preview for the jury, what that paragraph that we just read, in essence, what is that?

A.  That's just summarizing the arguments that the companies kept making primarily through the Tobacco Institute, their paid financed group, that they jointly financed to basically speak on issues related to smoking and these were the arguments that they kept using to say it wasn't proven even though it was well established and well known.

Even internally in the companies that the evidence was overwhelming indicting smoking, and the evidence against smoking is a cause of disease was scant by their own words.

Q.  So are we going to see some of the public statements that the industry made regarding their positions on cigarettes as hazard?

A.  We'll see both public statements.  We'll also look at their internal business records so you can know exactly when they had figured it out. I mean � and what they continued to say publicly.

And this is what the Federal Trade Commission here, they're just parroting what the companies are saying.  This public relations campaign which was funded with over a billion dollars between 1958, and when they went out of business in 1998.

The Tobacco Institute was a very professional relations effort to create doubt in the public's mind about the health controversy so smokers would have an excuse to keep smoking and young people wouldn't have a worry about taking it up because �

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

1 something different?

2      A.  Money.  They sold two to three cents to

3 make a cigarette.  They were making a lot of

4 money, and if people knew that their products were

5 dangerous, as we now know and now the evidence is

6 out and smoking sales are plummeting every year.

7           Fewer young people are taking up

8 smoking.  So the information does make a

9 difference, and had that gotten out when they knew

10 back in the '50s, then they'd be out of business

have only a vague general awareness of the hazards of smoking, without knowing the specific hazards and risk, the following 1964 conclusion of the commission is worth reconsidering.

The argument that everyone is aware of the health hazards of smoking fails to take adequate account of the existence of different levels of awareness.

To be remotely or dimly aware of a subject is not the equivalent of having the kind of knowledge upon which people normally act.

Much of the publicity concerning the health implications of cigarette smoking is mere hearsay.  Many people are aware that it has been said that smoking is harmful, but this is not the same as knowing that smoking is harmful.

1964 Cigarette Rule, and it cites where it came from, correct? A.  Correct.

Q.  What does that mean, many people are aware that it has been said that smoking is harmful, but this is not the same as knowing that smoking is harmful?

16 difference between awareness of health hazards of

17 smoking for someone and believing that smoking is

18 hazardous?

19      A.  It's a primary area of my research.  I

20 mean I do research on human behavior and human

behavior related to their health, particularly related to smoking to study carefully the difference between having heard something, awareness, versus a belief versus personalizing that belief, accepting the fact that something

could actually affect you, and what affects behave is when you personalize that belief or risk and you believe it will affect you.  That's when it affects your behavior.

We've all heard that there may be aliens wandering around on the planet.  Most of us probably don't believe that, but if you believed it and then you thought they were in your backyard and they were coming in your house, you probably would do something.

So, you know, awareness is very general as they're talking about.  It really has no impact on behavior.  General belief, a little bit more impact, and personalizing that risk is what really influences people's behavior, and that's true with regards to smoking.

In the 1980s, most people had this sort of vague awareness that smoking was harmful, but they really didn't have a clear belief about what the risks were and how dangerous it was.

And most people had not really personalized that risk unless they, in fact, had been adversely affected themselves by smoking.

1           MR. BASS:  Robert, please.

2      Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  It says:  This conclusion

3 is further supported by data indicating that less

4 than three percent of adults exposed to cigarette

5 ads ever even read the warning.

6           While cigarette ads present their

7 [message in a variety of frequently changing, attention getting formats using numerous image

9 provoking, personalizable themes, the current

10 abstract warning in the same rectangular shape has

11 appeared unchanged in every cigarette ad for so

12 long that few people ever notice or pay attention

13 to it.

14           Did I read that right?

15      A.  Yes.

16      Q.  Dr. Cummings, who is Robert Heimann?

17      A.  He was the � he was an employee of

18 [American Tobacco.  He started off as one of their

sales executives and rose to the president of

20 American Tobacco.

Q.  Was American Tobacco Company part of the 50-year conspiracy?

A.  A big part of it.  So, yes.

Q.  Co-conspirators with the defendants in this courtroom?

A.  Yes.  American Tobacco, Mr. Heimann was the president of that company in the 1970s, and then I think he retired in the mid '80s, but he was � and before that, he was sort of director of sales.  So he was the senior executive of that company.

And American Tobacco in the 1950s, was the biggest of the cigarette companies.  They had Lucky Strike and Pall Mall which were top selling brands.

Q.  Are you familiar with a deposition that

of the American Tobacco Company?

A.  Yes.  He was � gave a deposition.  I think he was asked to give � the most informed of the people who would appear, and so he appeared on behalf of American Tobacco in the mid-1980s, in a deposition where he was asked about his views on smoking and health and other topics.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd offer clips of that deposition into evidence, PT1691.

THE COURT:  Okay.  If those are the ones I've approved, then they'll be in.

VOICE:  Does advertising play a role in the personal selection of a cigarette?

VOICE:  We hope so.  When we advertise, it's difficult to confirm this, but we do make the effort, and I think it's fair to assume that the expenditure of large quantities for advertising does give status to a brand and, therefore, influences some people to select that brand.

VOICE:  But one of the objectives of advertising for cigarettes simply to put your advertising best foot forward and hope that it serves all purposes �

industry messages, is there evidence that Mary Cooper continued to rely on cigarette company

A.  Yes.  She said she did, and she said she saw these messages where they denied the health risks.  She commented on it in her deposition and also in the interview.

Q.  Okay.  Dr. Cummings, we're going to thank you for that.  We're going to transition now into another of the topics that we previewed for the jury, and that is the 50-year cover-up.

A.  Okay.

Q.  And the place to start I think because we have kind of discussed things as we've been going throughout is with demonstrative PDR096, which is the per capita consumption and lung cancer death rate chart.  It's a demonstrative.

And, Dr. Cummings, you're familiar with this chart, aren't you?

A.  Sure, very familiar with it.

Q.  And would it be helpful in assisting your testimony in explaining to the jury how we started and ultimately got to the point in 1953, where the conspiracy begins?

A.  Yes.  To give context to understand how

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=397
1605

1 the companies got together and why they did what

2 they did, you have to understand the rapid growth

3 of cigarettes in this century and how it was

4 correlated with increase in disease risk.

5           We call that an epidemic when you see

6 incidence of disease, and this is lung cancer in

7 men and women.  You can see it's shooting up.

8           And it correlates directly with the

9 increase in cigarettes.  So there were virtually

10 no lung cancers, about 100, 200 lung cancers at

11 the turn of the 20th century, yet there was

12 tobacco.  People chewed it.  People smoked it in

13 cigars and pipes.

14           There were cigarettes at that time.

15 They were largely of a single blend, often Turkish

16 tobacco, which is very low nicotine.  So not

17 particularly addictive because of the very low

18 nicotine content, or burley, which was too harsh

19 to inhale.

20           It wasn't really until they invented the

21 blended cigarette which brought together burley,

22 Turkish tobacco, and bright tobacco which was

23 flue-cured, heated.

24           So they flue-cured the tobacco rather

25 than air-cured it, and that changed the character

of the smoke, making it milder and easier to inhale.

Camel was the first to induce the blended cigarette in 1913, and if you look at the chart, cigarette sales begin to go up dramatically with the introduction of the Camel cigarettes right around � I'm not sure.

MR. PHILIPSON:  The red button.

THE WITNESS:  It's the red button.  I'm not sure.  There we go.  Right around there (indicating).

So right around 1913.  And there's another little fact.  Pretty much American Tobacco ran the cigarette business.  They captured the

15 market by buying up the rights to the automated

cigarette making machinery which was invented in the 1880s.

So they held on to that, and they were actually � they were broken up, let's put it that way, in 1911, and that sort of spawned independent cigarette companies like RJ Reynolds and Lorillard and others and American.

But Reynolds came up and invented the Camel cigarettes.  You have Lucky Strike that went to a blended version.  Lucky Strike was introduced

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

in 1916.

And Chesterfield, which was a Liggett

3 payers product, that was a product that existed

4 before 1913, but it reblended itself in the

5 after 1913, as a blended product.

6           Those three brands really dominated the

7 [market up until the mid 1940s.  I mean there were other brands, but they were minor brands at that

9 point.

10           And you can see cigarette � you know,

11 the lung cancer rates lag by about 15 to 20 years

12 because you need that level of exposure basically

13 to begin to see the rise.

14           And men took up smoking in greater

15 numbers before women because � largely because

16 World War I was in there, and they started handing

out free cigarettes.

It was actually easier to give the cigarettes to the soldiers.  We didn't have airplanes flying across the Atlantic.  You had boats that took the supplies over to the soldiers in Europe, and a lot of the chewing tobacco, which was the predominant form of tobacco used at that time would get moldy in the long trip over the ocean.

13 14 15 16 17 18

20 21 22 23 24 25

1608

So cigarettes were packaged, easy to use, supplied soldiers with nicotine.  They came back as addicted smokers, unlike the cigar every now and then or chewing which � you get addicted to chew tobacco, but it doesn't cause all the diseases that you tend to see with cigarettes.

Anyway, lung cancer rates took off.  The cigarette companies started to market heavily because they had a product that was addictive and was making them loads of money and you had companies that were competing and that fueled the

And they went after women about ten years later.  So beginning in the late '20s and '30s, a market that really wasn't smoking at that time, and so that's why you see the lag in women taking up smoking by about 10 to 15 years.

And their lung cancer rates lagged from

19 men.  They've now caught up to the men.  So, you

know, you can see these little dips.  This is the depression here.

So there was a little dip in the sale of cigarettes, but, you know, just accelerating really up until this point, and this is where the cover-up really begins.

Because the evidence on smoking, as you

up, the medical community, which had hardly seen any lung cancer, like I said, 200 cases, less than 200 in the entire United States.

Today we have 160,000 lung cancers diagnosed every year.  And there were hardly any and all of a sudden they start to appear, and so the medical literature starts to talk about smoking and health in the 1920 and '30s.

You start seeing some interesting animal studies that are being done with tar.  And a lot of that accumulated in the early '50s, and in 1953, cigarette sales dropped because of a lot of this evidence coming out, and the introduction of filtered cigarettes.

Companies were tracking this literature as well.  And the introduction of filtered cigarettes like Kent and Viceroy, the filter traps, what are you filtering out.

And that actually educated people that

22 maybe there was something, a problem, and there

was a little dip.

And so Paul Hahn, the president of

25 American Tobacco, called all the senior executives

of the major cigarette companies together at a

address the crisis.

The crisis they were addressing was the drop in cigarette sales that had occurred in 1953.

Knowlton, to create a campaign to be pro cigarette for them, to allay the public's fears and address the emerging evidence coming out related to smoking and health.

Their cigarettes sales rebounded.  All the companies pretty much switched and started to offer, for the most part, filtered cigarettes. Some of the companies that were late to the filter

15 movement like American, they began to lose market

share rapidly.

1900, with the chart, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And just so the jury can understand, I know you talked about it, just so they know, blue line is cigarette per capita consumption, correct?

A.  Yeah, it's the number of sticks of cigarettes sold per capita, and that's 18 and older.  So if you take the population 18 and older and divide it by the number of cigarettes, which is a way of standardizing the sales to the size of the population, because the population is growing over time.

So this is standardized.  So you take that out of the equation.

Q.  And as you said, 1930, this, it looks like a maroon or red line is lung cancer in men, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And then this lighter yellow/brown line is lung cancer in women, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And you explained that lung cancer death rate is very low in 1900, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And so as you explained, cigarette

consumption rises to 19 � early 1950s for so, correct?

A.  Correct.

MR. PEDROSA:  Your Honor.  I object. This is repetitive.  Dr. Cummings just went over all this.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'll let it stand.

Mr. Bass, about two more minutes we'll break for lunch, sir.

MR. BASS:  Yes, Your Honor. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  As you explained the dip, and the dip, you mentioned in your answer, but was there some information coming out � I mean were scientists, medical people paying attention to the rise in cigarette consumption and the rise in lung cancer in men?

A.  Yes.  I mean there were five articles that came out in 1950, linking cigarette smoking to lung cancer, major medical journals both here in the United States and also in Great Britain.

And in 1953, Dr. Wynder, who had published one of the studies on humans in 1950, published a study in the Journal of Cancer Research on mouse painting.

Now there had been many mouse painting experiments before that where you could paint the tar on the back of the skin of the mouse, and if you did that with peanut butter, you get no tumors, but it you did it with tobacco tar, you get tumors, and more tar, more tumors.

The size of the tumors are larger.  You get more of them.  He did that research and published this.  This is now showing as if there was something in the tar.  We didn't know exactly what it was, that would cause the cancer.

That got picked up, as did some of these other articles, in Popular Press, and that along with the marketing of filtered cigarettes in 1953, you see this dramatic dip in cigarette sales which the cigarette company executives viewed as a crisis.

And their scientists didn't come together.  It was just the presidents of the company.

THE COURT:  All right.

We'll break for lunch at this stage, folks.  We'll pick up in the afternoon at 1:20. Don't discuss the case during the recess.  Don't access the Internet to gain any information about

MR. DAVIS: Your Honor, before we break, I just wanted to thank Mr. Bass for saving us over here.

I know Dr. Cummings wasn't intending it, but when he would look away, the laser was still on, and you were tagging us a little bit, and so that's why he took it away.

THE COURT:  I'm sure he didn't �

MR. DAVIS:  I just wanted to let you know about that, if you can maybe watch that and cut it off because we were a little concerned about our eyes.

THE WITNESS:  Sorry.

MR. DAVIS:  Thank you, Hardee.

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.

Hardee, make sure you give them the upcoming exhibits again, please.

MR. BASS:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  We will be in recess until 1:20  Have a good lunch, everyone.

2               (Continued from Volume 13.)

3           THE COURT:  Okay.  Everybody back, Wes?

4           THE BAILIFF:  Yes, Judge.

5           MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, do you want to hear

6       that issue on the 2010 report now?

7           THE COURT:  Yep.  What is it?

8           MR. DAVIS:  This is Exhibit 3895 that I

9       think they skipped and wanted us to argue.  In

10       Banks, Your Honor, this is the 2010 Surgeon

11       General Report.  It was admitted � only the

12       preface was admitted, and they proposed to

13       offer � maybe, I don't know, Robert, if you

14       could punch it up so the judge could see it or I

15       could hand it up.

16           It is more to the advertising, and the text

17       that they want to show is that cigarettes remain

18       one of the most heavily marketed products in the

19         United States with more than 250 billion dollars 2 0                   expended between 1940 and '05.  I had made my

21       argument on that issue.  I mean, I think � I

22       don't know if it was argued in Banks, but the

23       only thing that was in was the two preface pages

24       there in Banks, and they're expanding it beyond

25       the redactions.

1           THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr.

2           Bass.

3           MR. BASS:  Yes, Your Honor.  This is

4       obviously not the preface page that was admitted

5       in Banks.  I don't know if this page was offered

6       in Banks to know whether it was excluded or not,

7       but we are offering it here under an adoptive

8       admission by the defendants as they link to

9       Surgeon General's Reports on their website.

10           THE COURT:  Well, look, I mean, it's one

11       thing to put in articles that have both sides or

12       at least � but, I mean, this just draws a

13       conclusion, Hardee.  The influence of these

14       tobacco efforts and behaviors and it was

15       concluded by whom?

16           MR. BASS:  The Surgeon General's Report.

17           THE COURT:  There's not much on here that he

18       hasn't already said, for sure, about seven

19       times.

20           MR. DAVIS:  Well, it's a new date and it's a

21       new figure.  And I agree with you, I think I

22       expressed our concern about this advertising.

23       It's one thing in the Surgeon General's Report,

24       they've got public health issues, but in this

25       courtroom the advertising is not actionable.  It

1       is preempted and it's legal.

2           THE COURT:  But it's being offered for

3       different purposes in this case and entered into

4       trials, Mr. Davis.  2006 would have been when

5       the Engle, I don't know, whenever that � when

6       was Engle decided?  It was decided by the

7       Supreme Court in, what, 2006?

8           MR. BASS:  Yes, sir.

9           MR. DAVIS:  This is the 2010 report.

10           THE COURT:  I know that, sir.  It's

11       referencing the period of 2006 dollars, the 250

13           MR. DAVIS:  That's true.

14           THE COURT:  That would have been in the

15       Engle period.  And it's talking about between 40

16       and 2005, within the Supreme Court decision

17       period.  2008 is the � what's NCI?  National �

21           MR. DAVIS:  Yes, sir.

22           THE COURT:  I'll allow that one excerpt and

23       that's it.  Nothing else on the 2010 report.  It

24       seems to be cumulative of other evidence.  Over

1       anything else in on 2010.

2           MR. PEDROSA:  Your Honor, I understand that

3       you've ruled.  Let me just say for the record

4       that the Engle Supreme Court decision came down

5       in 2006, but they're talking about jury verdict

6       that came down in 19 98.

7           THE COURT:  I'm fully aware of that.

8           MR. PEDROSA:  This is well after �

9           THE COURT:  I've been very cautious about

10       what I let in.  One excerpt, which all it does

11       is say what he's already said seven times.  It's

12       cumulative if anything.  I'll let it in, only

13       that one excerpt.

14           What's all this stuff about smoking and

15       motor vehicle accidents?

16           MS. LUTHER:  That's one of the ones that I

17       wanted to talk to you about, Judge.

18           THE COURT:  Are you offering this, Mr. Bass?

19           MR. BASS:  Yes, Judge, we are.

20           THE COURT:  For what purpose?  Where did

21       this come from?

22           MR. BASS:  It's from Arthur D. Little, which

23       was, as Dr. Cummings will explain, was a

24       research group for Liggett, just like some of

25       these other entities have been and we believe

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=417
1625

1       this demonstrates Liggett's knowledge of the

2       health hazards of smoking.  It's internal

3       knowledge.  Because what it talks about is the

4       number � I think it talks about the number of

5       years shaved off of someone's �

6           THE COURT:  This is a comparison between

7       people dying from smoking and people dying from

8       motor vehicle accidents, right?

9           MR. BASS:  Yes, sir.

10           THE COURT:  Anything else?

11           MR. BASS:  No, sir.

12           THE COURT:  Then the objection is sustained.

13       It's collateral and I don't think it's probative

14       of anything.  We're going to get off on all

15       kinds of tangents about nonsmoking related

16       issues.

17           MS. LUTHER:  That's Exhibit 1989, Tracey.

18           THE COURT:  Anything else?

19           Ready, Hardee?

20           MR. BASS:  Yes, sir.

21           THE COURT:  Bring the jury in.

22            (Jury entered the courtroom at 1:29 p.m.)

DIRECT EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, where we had left off is right at the point in time there are some epidemiological studies coming out and cigarette sales are starting to decline around 1953.

Before we get back into that discussion let's go back to one thing that I overlooked in our wrap-up of the advertising section; and that is, has the 2010 Surgeon General's Report � we had a discussion about advertising and how much money is spent and the influence.  Has the Surgeon General's 2010 Report addressed that topic? A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  And at this time, Your Honor, we would offer PT 3895 and publish the excerpt that was discussed earlier.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

Q.    This is the 2010 report.

A.    Correct.

Q.    "Cigarettes remain one of the most heavily

250 billion (in 2006 dollars) expended between 1940 and 2005 on cigarette advertising and promotion.  The influence of these tobacco industry efforts in shaping tobacco-related knowledge, opinions, attitudes and behavior was reviewed in detail and it was concluded that the total weight of evidence demonstrated a causal relationship between tobacco advertising and promotion and increased tobacco use."

Did I read that right?

A.    You did.

Q.    Thank you, Dr. Cummings.

Okay.  1953.  Robert, do we have the cigarette chart demonstrative just to reorient? Please.

1953, right around this time period shows that cigarette sales are in a decline.  Are the � besides scientists, medical folks paying attention, are cigarette companies also paying attention to the decrease in cigarette sales and the rise in lung cancer?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Who is Claude Teague?

A.    As I explained yesterday, he is an employee of RJ Reynolds.  He was a chemist.  Started at Reynolds in 1951 and was � actually set up their chemistry unit there.  And then in the '70s he sort of rose up the ranks to do new product development and then in the '80s, you know, was a senior R&D person overseeing a number of areas of activity at Reynolds.  And I think he retired finally in mid 1980s from Reynolds.

Q.    In February 1953 does he undertake a survey of cancer research to date with an emphasis upon the possible carcinogens in tobacco?

A.    Yes.  He did a review of the scientific evidence, a review of the literature, published literature at the time.  I think he cited some 78 articles looking at the evidence linking tobacco and cancer using animal studies, human clinical studies and

1629 chemistry studies.

Of course this is in the early '50s so the chemistry methods are really just evolving to figure out, you know, what's in the smoke at that time.  But he summarized those three areas and then drew some conclusions from the findings.

Q.    And is that PT 3608 his survey of cancer research?

A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer 3608 into evidence.

MR. BELASIC:  No objection. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 3608 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And as we introduced, "Survey of cancer research with emphasis upon possible carcinogens from tobacco, by Claude E. Teague, Junior, 2 February 1953, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And what did Dr. Teague conclude on February 2, 1953?

A.    Well, he concluded that as cigarette consumption had gone up there was this parallel

1630 increase in lung cancer, like you saw in those charts, and that the evidence based on the human clinical studies, as he says, "closely parallel increase in cigarette smoking has led to the suspicion that tobacco smoking is an important etiologic factor in the induction of primary cancer of the lung.  Studies of clinical data tend to confirm the relationship between heavy and prolonged tobacco smoking and incidence of cancer of the lung."

Those are the human studies, when he refers to human clinical studies.

MR. BELASIC:  Can he read the next whole sentence, Your Honor? THE COURT:  Yes.

THE WITNESS:  "Extensive, though inconclusive, testing of tobacco substances on animals indicates the probable presence of carcinogenic agents in those substances.  One worker has identified known carcinogens in tobacco pyrolysate, and compounds are present in tobacco which on pyrolysis could theoretically give rise to compounds similar to known carcinogens.  The possible role of tobacco additives in cigarette paper and the production of carcinogens could not be determined because

1631 of the lack of access to information on the substances use." BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Now, at the time and throughout his career, Dr. Teague worked for RJ Reynolds, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    In your review of internal company documents have you seen other companies also tracking the rise of cigarette consumption and the rise in the incidence of lung cancer?

A.    Sure.  All the companies tracked the evidence.  Lorillard in the mid 1940s is talking about tracking some of the animal studies that were published by Dr. Rolfo, whose work is cited in the Teague review.

15 And then Philip Morris as well was tracking studies

back from the '20s, the '30s, the '40s, the '50s and so on.  And this gets summarized � a lot of it gets summarized in the '50s and '60s.

Q.    And that's 1953.  And ultimately is there one of these epidemiological studies that ultimately

21 makes it into the news, into Life Magazine?

A.    Sure.  Actually, not an epidemiologic study They highlighted in 1953, I think it was the December issue of Life Magazine in 1953 that covered Dr. Wynder's mouse-painting experiments that I had

1632 talked about this morning.  Those experiments, which I think came out in the Journal of Cancer Research in June of that year, were summarized as sort of the inside spread of the magazine, and they had a picture of the smoking machine with Dr. Graham and the tar that they would extract, Dr. Cloninger, who was one of the authors.  And then they described the research.  And then they had a comment I think from American Tobacco at the time.  And that was in December of 1953.

MR. BASS:  And for the record, we have that as PT 971 and PT 3013.  We would offer those into evidence, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibits PT 971 and PT 3013 were received in evidence.)

THE WITNESS:  Yeah, so that's the study just showing how they would paint the mice with the tar and then the tumors there. BY MR. BASS:

Q. This was the Life Magazine, I guess article, for lack of a better word, that you referenced before, right?

A.    Yep, Canasta pajamas, that was on the cover of Life Magazine and this was the article inside the

25 magazine that highlighted the study.  That's Dr. Graham

the lower left.  She was the lab technician who did the

work.  And then they just give a little synopsis of the

study and then a comment from American Tobacco.

Q.    That's what we have highlighted over here, right?

A.    Right.

Q.    "The American Tobacco Company hastened to point out that tests on mice do not prove that tobacco can cause lung cancer in man."

Did I read that right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And that was within the article contained within Life Magazine, right?

A.    Yes.  So in December 1953 that's what

16 American Tobacco was saying, even though Claude Teague

had concluded the human studies did show that smoking caused cancer, and that was in February of 1953, so a number of months earlier.

Q.    So now, early December 1953 cigarette sales have been declining.  Are tobacco stock prices also declining in value?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And are you familiar with a New York Times article from December 10th, 1953, PT 1044 A, a headline

MR. BASS:  Your Honor at this time we'd offer 1044 A into evidence.

MR. BELASIC:  No objection. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 1044 A was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And that's the headline, what's cut off there, "Tobacco stocks hit by cancer" �

"Tobacco stocks hit by cancer reports. Some drop to lows for year after medical warnings, but industry spokesman scoffs.

"Tobacco stocks dropped nearly four points yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange in the wake of unqualified medical reports linking cigarette smoking with lung cancer.  The sharp dip, which carried the stocks of the 'Big Five' brands to new lows for the year, was the climax to a general decline that has continued for several weeks despite the repeated advice of brokerage houses that the shares were good buys." Did I read that right? A.    Yes. Q.    December 10th, 1953 that article comes out.

1635 Does the tobacco industry take action that very same day to address this issue?

A.    Yes.  Paul Hahn sends a telegram out � he's the president of American Tobacco � to all the heads of the major cigarette companies to come together at a

sending an invitation out to do so and to address the crisis that was confronting the industry, the drop in cigarette sales as a result of emerging evidence on the hazards of their product.

Q.    And do you have an opinion � you mentioned addressing the crisis.  Do you have an opinion as to what the presidents of the tobacco companies viewed as the actual crisis? A.    Yes.

Q.    And what is that opinion? A.    Drop in their stock price and a drop in their profits as a result.

Q.    And you said the telegram, two questions about that.  One, is that PT 1044? A.    Right.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd offer 1044 into evidence.

3 BY MR. BASS:

4     Q.    And also, talking telegram, so that also

5 kind of highlights how long ago we're talking about

6 here.

7     A.    Yeah, no e-mail back then.  So they were

8 sending telegrams.  And this is one of the ways they

9 communicated.  This was from � this particular

10 telegram was from the president of American Tobacco,

11 Paul Hahn, to Mr. Darr, who was the president of

12 RJ Reynolds.

13           But in the telegram they indicate all of the

14 companies had been invited to the meeting.

15     Q.    Right.  The telegram to the presidents of

16 the following companies:  RJ Reynolds, Liggett and

17 Myers, P. Lorillard, Philip Morris, Brown and

18 Williamson, Benson & Hedges and then two others � or

19 another gentleman representing the tobacco growing

20 interest, right?

21     A.    Correct.

22     Q.    And so that was an invitation to meet when

23 and where, Dr. Cummings?

24     A.    Plaza Hotel in New York City.  And they did

25 meet December 14th.  All but Liggett and Myers came to

1637 the meeting, so Liggett and Myers declined attending the meeting.

Q.    How soon after the telegram and the stock drop � strike that.

How soon after the stock drop, the telegram went out on December 10th, 1953, did the heads of those tobacco companies meet at the Plaza Hotel?

A.    They met on December 14th, so four days later.  And then they met again on the 15th with the president and executives of Hill and Knowlton public relations firm.  They agreed on the 14th to hire a public relations firm, help them address the crisis that was confronting the industry at that time.

Q.    Hill and Knowlton public relations firm, was that a large public relations firm of the day?

A.    At the time it was one of the most prestigious public relations firms in the country, largest, and they had many corporate clients.  And they were hired not just by one company, but all of the companies jointly agreed to fund them, except for Liggett and Myers, which came in a little later and joined the Tobacco Institute.  That was in 1958.  So Liggett and Myers didn't really get involved in the group agreement until 1958.

163: task that was handed to Hill and Knowlton?  What were they hired to do?

A.    They were basically hired to help the cigarette manufacturers address the evidence that was coming out around the health risks of smoking to create a pro cigarette campaign to allay consumers' fears that they might have about smoking.  So they went about developing a public response that they would give, which they published jointly in major newspapers around the country in 1954.  They outlined the strategy of how the program would be rolled out and what announcements they would make.  They said to be legitimate they ought to be funding a research program so they announced that they were going to start funding research into smoking and health as part of that advertisement.

Q.    And that's The Frank Statement we're talking about, right?

A.    Frank Statement, 1954.  That was January of 1954.  The company executives and Hill and Knowlton folks were meeting 14th, 15th, the 24th, so the day before Christmas, 26th, day after Christmas.  The 28th is when they sort of make the final decisions on the text of The Frank Statement ad and how it's all going to be paid for jointly by the companies based on their

8     Q.    And is that PT 2061?

9     A.    Yes.  Written by Ed Dakins [sic], who was an

10 executive at Hill and Knowlton.  And he's basically

11 summarizing interviews, because to get to know their

12 new client, the tobacco industry, they went about

13 interviewing some of the senior executives,

14 specifically the research directors of four of the

15 companies.  And Mr. Dakins in this Forwarding Memo is

16 outlining some of the things that he learned based on

17 the interviews with the research directors of the major

18 cigarette companies and what the challenge was to Hill

19 and Knowlton moving forward based on that information.

1640 BY MR. BASS:

Q.    "Forwarding Memorandum," titled "to Members of the Planning Committee."

If we go to the next page, please, Robert, where I think it highlights what you just said, Dr. Cummings.

Outlining, "four interviews with 'research directors' are given at some length."

And who � generally speaking, the research directors of who, the cigarette companies that were involved?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And it's written �

A.    Yes, four of the cigarette companies.  In fact, the memo in December 15th sort of reference they had already interviewed three of the senior � you know, the R&D � the head of R&D of each of the � three of the companies, and they were doing the fourth one I think on December 15th.  They sort of reference that.  And then you see the Forwarding Memo, which is summarizing comments from the research directors of the companies.

Q.    "One of the men said, 'It's fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they can't break.'  Said another, 'Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our company

was first to produce a cancer free cigarette.  What we could do to competition.'  Said another, 'Suppose everybody smoked just one cigarette less a day.  That would be maybe 40 billion a year.'  And again, 'The stock market fall is terrible, when you remember dividends are going to be much larger next year without the E.P.T.'"

Did I read that right?

A.    Yeah.  E.P.T. is excess profit tax.

Q.    And on the next page, as you indicated kind of, it's summarizing what was learned from the research directors also indicates what the plan needs to be, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    "But, naturally, this [sic] is something almost too terrible for most of the industry's men to realize, even yet � though the very heads of the great corporations themselves signalized the end of the old days, when they linked arms and walked together to consult with us."

Is this the beginning of the conspiracy to conceal the health hazards of smoking from the American public?

A.    Yes, it is.

Q.    Is this the beginning of the conspiracy to

1642 conceal what the companies knew about the addictive quality and nature of cigarettes from the American public?

A.    It is.  It's the agreement among the companies that they would work together.  And they talk about what their goal is going to be.  This is sort of outlined here as the challenge.  "There's only one problem � confidence, and how to establish it; public reassurance, [sic] and how to create it � in a perhaps long interim when scientific doubts must remain.  And,

the guilty fear that is going to arise deep in their biological depths � regardless of any pooh-poohing logic � every time they light a cigarette."

Q.    That was the plan, right?

A.    He said that's the challenge to Hill and Knowlton on behalf of their new client, the cigarette industry.

Q.    And what the industry did over the next 50 years in conspiring to and concealing this information, did it work?

A.    Yes, by their own account it worked.  They talked about how it had been successful defense of operation for them.  That it had never been a plan for victory but one merely as a holding strategy to create

doubt in the public's mind that it had been proven that smoking caused disease.

Q.    How long � you said 50 years.  When did the conspiracy � or strike that.

When did � when was the first time that any of these companies in this courtroom today publicly acknowledged that cigarette smoking was hazardous, harmful to health?

A.    Different times.  Philip Morris, it was October of 2000 was the first time they acknowledged that cigarette smoking caused disease and was addictive.

Reynolds and Lorillard was a little bit later.

Liggett and Myers, 1997.

Q. Same with respect to public position on the addictiveness of cigarettes, around the same time for each of those companies.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And so when we're talking about the length of the conspiracy, right, '53 to essentially the late 1990s.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And did their conspiracy work that entire time?

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=436
1644

1     A.    Yes.  I mean, obviously the evidence on the

2 dangers of smoking accumulated and more and more people

3 started to get information.  But really it wasn't until

4 the 1980s, late '70s and '80s that we really shifted

5 public knowledge about smoking.  And that's continued

6 to increase as the evidence is so overwhelming.  The

7 most studied risk factor in medical history is

8 cigarettes.  So it's not one that we don't know

9 anything about.  We know more about that than anything

10 else really in terms of cause of disease.

11     Q.    So the conspiracy continued to impact

12 smokers even after 1982.

13     A.    Sure.

14     Q.    And did it continue to effect Mary Cooper

15 even after 1982?

16           MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor, ultimate

21     Q.    Do you have an opinion, Dr. Cummings, as to

22 whether even after 1982 the conspiracy by these

23 cigarette companies to conceal the health hazards of

24 smoking from the public, including Mary Cooper, and the

25 addictive nature of cigarettes from the public,

1645 including Mary Cooper, affected the public, including

MR. DAVIS:  Same objection, Your Honor. Same question.

THE COURT:  Compound question.  Sustain the objection the way it's phrased. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    We're talking about The Frank Statement, Dr. Cummings.  And on January 4th, 1954 was The Frank Statement published? A.    Yes.

Q.    Is that PT 307? A.    Yes, it is.

MR. BASS:  We'd offer that into evidence, Your Honor.

MR. BELASIC:  No objection. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 307 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Let me just ask you this, Dr. Cummings.

22 What was the reach � was this published in newspapers?

A.    Yes.  Over 400 major newspapers.  They selected large city newspapers with a large population as the place that they would have their paid ad, so

1646 they did it as a paid ad, full-page in most newspapers, so their position would get out, rather than as a public service ad, which, you know, you never can predict whether a public or press release will be picked up.

Q.    And a couple of things that are highlighted here.  You've mentioned it a few times, Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  And what is that?

A.    This is the organization that was created actually at the suggestion of John Hill of Hill and Knowlton.  He insisted when he met with the executives on December 15th that they create a research organization to study the link between smoking and disease, otherwise they would look pretty lame just putting out an advertising campaign.

So they announced the creation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which was located, as you can see, in the Empire State Building, one floor below the offices of Hill and Knowlton, public relations firm.

And these are the signers of The Frank Statement.  So you've got American Tobacco, Brown and

23 Williamson, Lorillard, Philip Morris, RJ Reynolds,

Benson & Hedges, which is Joe Cullman was bought by Philip Morris the next year.  And Joe Cullman becomes

1647 the president of that company eventually.

Q.    So at the time � and I know we talked about Liggett and Myers joined in 1958, and we're going to get there � these are the members of the conspiracy, correct?

A.    That's correct.

Q.    And let's see some of the things that � and so what was The Frank Statement?  We're going to look at some of the things, but essentially what was it?

A.    It was an advertisement but it gave the position of the major cigarette manufacturers as to the emerging evidence on smoking and health in 1954.  They acknowledged that animal studies had came out, I think they were probably referencing, although they don't say specifically, the Wynder, Graham and Cloninger study that was featured in Life Magazine and the

17 mouse-paintings.

And then they go on to highlight the fact that there's debate as to whether smoking is a cause of disease.  In fact, they even say there's no evidence that smoking causes disease, which is clearly untrue. They said there is no proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes.  And Claude Teague months earlier had done his review where he concluded just the opposite.

164 And then they made three affirmative promises to the American public where they say, "We accept an interest in people's health as a basic responsibility, paramount to every other consideration in our business.  We believe the products we make are not injurious to health.  And we always have and always will cooperate closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the public health."

So those were the three affirmative statements that they said they would fulfill.  And then they announced the creation of this Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which was allegedly going to fund research into smoking and the diseases alleged to be related to smoking.  In fact, that was their articles of incorporation that they talk about.

Q.    These three promises, did the tobacco industry keep these three promises to the American public, including Mary Cooper?

A.    No, they did not.

Q.    And what do you base that opinion on?

A.    Based on material that has come to me as to what they knew about the health risks of cigarettes versus what they told the American public.  They put their profits ahead of the public health by far.  They certainly � in 1953 maybe there was some debate about

1649 smoking causing disease, but by the end of the '50s there was no debate.  And that evidence was known at that point to them internally.

And they didn't work cooperatively with public health.  They fought public health.  So they didn't keep those promises, and as a result that campaign � this organization through its entire history, went out of business in 1998, never once acknowledged that smoking caused disease over that entire period.

Q.    Are we going to see some examples throughout the years of what they said publicly and what they were saying internally?

A.    Yes, we will.

Q.    Who is Stanley N. Barnes?

A.    Stanley Barnes was the Assistant Attorney General of the United States in this time period.  He was a former judge so they call him Judge Barnes.

And there was communication back and forth between Stanley Barnes and members of the organizing committee, this planning committee, like Paul Hahn, who was the president of American Tobacco, because they were concerned about other issues like antitrust issues getting together, competitive companies, like they did.

25 And so that was Stanley Barnes received communications

A.    Yes, basically the articles of incorporation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  It outlines exactly what their role would be, according to the committee, to the Department of Justice.  And what they told the Department of Justice was that "The purpose and objectives of the committee are to aid and assist research into tobacco use and health, and particularly into the alleged relationship between the use of tobacco and lung cancer, and to make available to the public factual information on this subject.  It is the considered judgment of the committee that its activities shall be confined to the purposes set forth above..."

Q.    So they've told the public through The Frank Statement about the TIRC.

A.    That's right.

Q.    They've now told the government in this communication to Judge Barnes, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Are we going to see internal acknowledgments about the real purpose of the TIRC and its later iteration, the CTR?

Q.    Are we going to see internal company documents regarding CTR and TIRC later on?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And are these internal company documents that weren't shared with the public?

A.    Those are internal business records as to what the cigarette companies said was the purpose of TIRC, later renamed as Council for Tobacco Research, CTR, same organization, they just changed the name in 1964.

Q.    Did the TIRC as it was going along produce progress reports?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Of some of the things that, at whatever particular time the progress reports were produced, that said what they had been doing and what they had done?

A.    Correct.

Q.    Is 3695 an example of one of those?

A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 3695.

VIDEO TECH:  Okay. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And just to give the jury an idea, that's one soon after The Frank Statement was released, right?

A.    Yeah, this particular document summarizes how much money was spent on the advertising campaign, on the scope of the reach of The Frank Statement, which was pretty extensive.  So that's the primary thing.

It comes from Hill and Knowlton.  So right out of the box you're not getting research.  What you're getting is reports of public relations activities.

Q.    As you say, it says the reach the committee � "statement entitled A Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers appeared in 448 newspapers, reaching a circulation of 43,245,000 in 258 cities," right?

1654 the potential dangers of cigarettes?

A.    Yes.  All the time.

Q.    Who is George Weissman?

A.    George Weissman was director of marketing at Philip Morris.  At the time, in 1954, he was a special assistant to the president of Philip Morris, who was Parker McComas.  And he was sort of the main creator of the remake of Marlboro.

Q.    And are you familiar with a speech he gave in 1954?

A.    Yes.  I mean, you know, right after The Frank Statement the executives from the companies, George Weissman being one of them, went out on the road to talk to, I think he gave a speech to vending machine owners or vending machine distributors as well as tobacco growers.  So I think we have one of those speeches where he sort of talks about The Frank Statement and the industry's position and again reinforces the promises of the industry of putting the public's health above all other considerations of their business.

Q.    Is that PT 3785?

A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  We'd offer 3785 at this time, Your Honor.

1655 THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 3785 was received in

evidence.)

BY MR. BASS:

Q. Just the heading, as you say, An address before the Seven States, Regional NAMA meeting, by George Weissman.

If you'd go to the next page, the highlighted section, and see what he said.  "I know this is your position as well as ours.  If any one of us believed that the product we were making and selling was in any way harmful to our customers' health, and our own as well, we would voluntarily go out of business."

Did I read that right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Who is Robert DuPuis?

A.    He was director of research at Philip Morris.

Q.    Are you familiar with whether Dr. DuPuis learned soon after Mr. Weissman was making statements like this, did Dr. DuPuis learn about some of those statements?

A.    Yes, some of those statements I think actually got picked up in the news.  This one is

1656 February.  I think there's another speech.  He gave

almost the exact speech to another group in March. And Dr. DuPuis is writing to Mr. Weissman about some of the concerns of his regarding the statements he was making. He was the director of research.

Q.    Now, at any point in time, as Mr. Weissman promised in that document, did Philip Morris stop making the product?

A.    No.

Q.    Even though they made that promise and even though they knew it was hazardous to health.

A.    That's true.  I mean, they not only made that promise in 1954, two times mentioned by

14 Mr. Weissman, it was made again in 1972 and again in

1997 by executives of Philip Morris.  They still sell cigarettes.

Q.    Could they have stopped making cigarettes?

A.    Sure.  It's a choice.  They choose to � not to go out of business.

Q.    You said there were other examples.  Was or did a Philip Morris executive say this as late as 1997?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And who was that?

A.    That was Geoffrey Bible, who was the CEO of Philip Morris at the time.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And is that PT 2147?

A.    Yes, it is.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd offer 2147.

THE COURT:  It's in evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 2147 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. DuPuis to Weissman, Philip Morris letterhead, March 31, '54.  "I have read a report in this morning's Richmond Times-Dispatch (enclosed) of your talk at the NATD meeting.  Unless you were

18 misquoted, the substance was that if we thought there

were anything in any way harmful in cigarette smoke, we would go out of business, and that one way to fight the cancer scare was with increased publicity.  You forget that several important, serious-minded, tho perhaps biased scientists have stated publicly that there is something harmful in tobacco smoke."

"It seems to me that it would have been more

165: impressive to say that we do not believe there is anything carcinogenic in smoke, but if evidence to the contrary is forthcoming, TIRC and our own research department are dedicated to removing it.  Moreover, because it is not only good business but it is our duty to our customers and stockholders, we are dedicated to going beyond any efforts of TIRC, ACS or any other organization.  Our objective is to determine all chemical constituents of smoke, and to develop means of removing any which are considered harmful." Did I read that right? A.    That's right.

Q.    Essentially telling him how to say it different.

A.    Right.

MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor, the document speaks for itself. THE COURT:  Sustained. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Besides making public statements, did

21 members of the TIRC and the conspiracy go on

television?

A.    Yes.

Q.    As we saw in the previous document, though, before I go on, did the companies put their duty to the

1659 stockholders above their duty to cigarette smokers? A.    Yes. Q.    How so?

A.    Well, they knew that there was harmful ingredients in cigarettes.  Eventually they were identified.  They knew their products caused disease and they did not � they also knew they couldn't fix the problem.  Because when you burn a column of tobacco in paper and inhale it into your lungs, you're not going to fix that problem.  And, you know, they continued to deny the health risks of smoking so they could create doubt and protect their profits so people would keep smoking.  I mean, that's all it was about. MR. BELASIC:  Object to the narrative, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Once again, please stay focused on the question. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    We have a video clip, PT 1682 BA, of Dr. DuPuis appearing on television, correct? A.    We do.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer 1682 BA.

MR. BELASIC:  We don't object, Your Honor, as long as we can play our portions later.

(Video clip was played and taken down to the best of the reporter's ability as follows:)

VOICE:  As Dr. Little said earlier, all of the research of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee is done independent of the cigarette companies.  Nonetheless, each major cigarette producer has been conducting its own experiments on this problem.  This is the Richmond laboratory of one of the major producers.

VOICE:  I am Dr. Robert N. DuPuis, chairman of the industry technical group of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  Our primary objective is to analyze all of the components of smoke.  Of course we do a great deal of research on analysis and technology of tobacco itself. But even if we knew all of the components of tobacco we still would not know the components of smoke.  And since smoke is what we sell, we feel that we should emphasize this phase of the research.

After we have produced the smoke and

1661 separated it into factions, the next step is to identify these factions.  These are then identified, either photographically or on the oscilloscope.  The oscilloscope is now demonstrating the means of identification of one of the smoke components.  Using these instruments we have isolated and identified some three dozen components of smoke, many more will be identified.  As we find these components, we publish the results of our work in technical journals which are available to any scientist in any part of the world.  So far we've found none that there was any cause for concern.  If we do find any that we consider harmful, and so far we have not, we will remove these from smoke and still retain the pleasure of your favorite cigarette.

(Video clip concluded.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Besides executives making speeches, statements on TV, did the TIRC and members of the conspiracy manage to get information published in the press that assisted in creating doubt about the dangers of smoking?

A.    Yes, quite a bit.

1662 Q.    And just as representative examples, do we have some New York Times articles from 1953, '55, '56 and '57, which is PT 3068, 9056, 3021 and 3122? A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd offer all four into evidence. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibits PT 3068, PT 9056, PT 3021, PT 3122 were received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And these are example � representative examples through those years in the 1950s about information from the TIRC or statements by the TIRC that gets picked up in the public press, correct?

A.    Right.  These were tracked statements, and you would see extensive reports from Hill and Knowlton to the tobacco companies about their success in getting stories refuting the claim that smoking caused disease in the popular press like the New York Times.

They ghost wrote magazine articles, "Smoke

21 Without Fear."

They put out a white paper called "The Cigarette Controversy," which, you know, basically was about there was a controversy unknown, a lot of doubt about the health effects, which was widely distributed.

1663 So this was � a lot of what they did was public relations.  In fact, in the first year or so of the organization that's all they did, only public relations.  There was no research done into the alleged risk of smoking.  So early on that's what they were doing.

Q.    Now, we've talked about the information coming out, the mouse skin-paintings, the dip in sales. The formation � if we could go back to � let me ask you this.

Do cigarette sales soon after the formation of the TIRC and the issuance of The Frank Statement start to increase again?

A.    Yes.  Wasn't just The Frank Statement.  It was obviously this massive public relations activity that went on and then you'd see statements internally about their success in rebounding cigarette sales and that the crisis again had been � was waning in terms of its importance, sort of fading in the public's mind.

Q.    And that's what we see here by this chart right around here, rates started to go back up.  So they increased, continue to increase year after year until around 1962 or '3.

A.    '63 I think was peak per capita, but actual overall sales of cigarettes didn't peak until the early

1664 '80s because of the population increase.

Q.    Now, as we see statistically per capita consumption increasing, as you alluded to earlier, were there internal acknowledgments about the fact that the health scare was waning and the TIRC and the conspiracy was actually working? A.    Yes.

Q.    And is 3694 an example of that? A.    Yes, it is.

MR. BASS:  We'd offer 3694 into evidence. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 3694 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And here, Dr. Cummings, is another one of those reports on the progress of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, correct? A.    That's right.

Q.    Factors that show improved position. "Nevertheless, progress has been made.  On the positive side, these factors stand out:

"1. The first 'big scare' continues on the wane.

"2. The research program of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee has won wide acceptance in

Did I read that right? A.    Yes.

MR. BELASIC:  May we read the next sentence, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  You may. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    "This is due primarily to the stature of the

soundness of the research program developed, the caliber of research so far approved and the investigation [sic] receiving grants." Did I read that right?

A.    "Investigators receiving grants."

Q.    "Investigators receiving grants."  Thank you.

Now, first of all, this was an internal Tobacco Industry Research Committee report, right?

A.    Right.  It was produced by Hill and Knowlton.

Q.    Let's talk about the makeup of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  Who was the chairman of the TIRC?

A.    The original chairman was Paul Hahn.  He

1666 served in that role for about three months.  Then Parker McComas from Philip Morris, who was president of Philip Morris, took over for three months.  And then they hired a permanent chairman, Timothy Hartnett, who had previously been the president of Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.

And then the executive committee was made up of all the presidents of the cigarette companies.

And then they had sort of a more of a policy oversight group called the lawyer committee that oversaw the hiring of staff and all the public statements that ever came out of the organization. They were all vetted.  So they were speaking on behalf of their members.

Q.    Do you have an opinion as to whether the TIRC was a sincere, valuable and scientific effort?

A.    I do.

Q.    And what is that opinion?

A.    It was not.  I can explain why if you'd like.

Q.    I was going to ask you to follow up with the basis of your opinion, please.

A.    Sure.  I mean, you can look at the internal business records of the companies themselves.  They acknowledge it wasn't a legitimate effort to get at

1667 smoking and health research.

Secondly, you can look at the research that was funded.  I got all of the research.  It came to me. That was what I digitized.  I looked at every grant they got and where they funded it and how it was selected.  And essentially what you find is only 1 out of 10 of the projects that they funded over their history dealt with the issue of smoking and health.  9 out of 10 of the projects had nothing to do with smoking as a cause of disease.  It was looking at other things, not smoking and health.  So it wasn't what they had told the Department of Justice what they were going to do.

And then I actually did a survey of the scientists who got money from the Council for Tobacco Research and asked them, does your research have anything to do with smoking and health?  And the

18 majority of them who wrote back to me or filled out the

survey said no; and, in fact, never in their career did they focus on smoking and health.  They weren't even the people doing the research on smoking and health.

22 And so it was a shield, a front, a public relations

gesture to give the public the notion that they were legitimately looking at this controversy.

1669 industry groups to discuss ways and means of presenting a united front against the claims that were being made that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer.  The formation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was the result.

"There is absolutely no question in my mind that if this committee had not been formed the cigarette industry by now would have been in a deplorable position.  Instead, a very fine job has been done in counteracting unverified, unjustified and unsubstantiated claims of the anticigarette fanatics. In other words, the TIRC has been a successful defensive operation."

Did I read that right? A.    Yes.

Q.    Do you have an opinion as to what would have happened to cigarette smoking rates had the TIRC and the conspiracy not been formed in 1954?

MR. BELASIC:  Objection, calls for speculation.

A.    It was addressing the decline in cigarette sales.

Q.    So based upon your education, training and experience, based upon the historical facts and what has happened since, do you have an opinion � is that what you base your opinion on as to what would have occurred to cigarette sales had the TIRC not been formed?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And what is that opinion?

MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, may we be heard � we object to this.  Lack of foundation, lack of scientific basis, speculation.  We could argue this at sidebar if the Court cares to hear us.

THE COURT:  As to all those legal grounds the objection is overruled.  Do you have anything else to tell me at sidebar?  Otherwise the objection is overruled and I'll let the witness answer the question.

MR. BELASIC:  I do, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  You can come sidebar.

(The following discussion was held at sidebar:)

THE COURT:  I think you were here last trial when I cautioned you that sidebars weren't permitted once I got comfortable in the afternoon session.  Didn't I tell you that before?

MR. BELASIC:  You did.  I did it once.

So he gave us this basis.  If he had given us a different basis maybe I wouldn't have objected, but he just said what he is going to base his prediction of what would have happened in the 1950s.  He's going to go back 50 years and speculate based on what happened since these

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=464
1672

1       organizations were disbanded, meaning after

2       1998.  So on the record under oath he says he's

3       going to presume that the same thing that's

4       happened in 1998 � completely different

5       context, completely different information,

6       completely different government setting � would

7       have happened in the 1950s.

8           THE COURT:  Well, the question � you've

9       changed the question twice, Mr. Bass.  First you

10       asked him that question that Mr. Belasic

11       objected to "What would happen if it was" � we

12       know what happened between that.  He can answer

13       that.  He can give an opinion.  But now you seem

14       to be asking him what was his opinion

15       essentially had the TIRC never been formed and

16       never been operating for the 40 or 50 years it

17       was operating.  Is that what you're asking him?

18           MR. BASS:  That's what I'm asking him, yes,

19       sir.  And one of the reasons for his opinion

20       that we hope he'll be able to give is in part

21       what has happened since the TIRC was disbanded.

22       So the reason I asked that question was a

23       foundation �

24           THE COURT:  What's the answer to both the

25                   questions?

MR. BASS:  He's going to say that cigarette sales continued to decline.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Anything else?

MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, just to add, he's already testified about the health risks in the '70s and '80s, it is a logical � it's illogical to say because of what happened in the '90s and after 2000 I can tell you what would have happened in the '50s and '60s.  It's like saying, you know, because of Iraq I could tell you what would have happened if we hadn't been in Korea.  It's an argument.

THE COURT:  He can render an opinion based on the historical perspective and his expertise. And you can challenge it on cross-examination. You tend to be arguing the weight more than the admissibility.

I'll overrule the objection.  I'll let him answer the question.

(Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the following proceedings were held in open court:)

THE COURT:  All right, sir, you can proceed. You need to repeat the question.  The objection is overruled.

MR. BASS:  Can you read it back, please?

1674 (A portion of the record was read by the reporter.)

THE WITNESS:  The opinion is had there not been � TIRC not been formed to create essentially a false controversy that lasted for nearly 50 years that many people would never have taken up smoking, because smoking rates now that that controversy is done, it ended, smoking rates are at the lowest levels they've ever been in our history.  Fewer people are taking up smoking.  More people are quitting smoking.  And many millions of lives would have been saved. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Let's look now at what � we talked about at least in the 1950s what was being said publicly by the industry.  Let's look at what they knew internally. A.    Okay.

Q.    Are you familiar with a document entitled "Report on visit to U.S.A. and Canada, 17 April to 12

20 May 1958"?

A.    I am.

MR. BASS:  That's PT 3289.  At this time we'd offer that into evidence. THE COURT:  In evidence. (Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 3289 was received in

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

1 evidence.)

2 BY MR. BASS:

3     Q.    And what occurred that spawned this

4 document, Dr. Cummings?

5     A.    Well, the joint committee in the United

6 States had put out a report � this is a group of the

7 major health voluntary organizations as well as the

8 National Cancer Institute had put out a publication

9 summarizing the literature at that point indicating

10 that smoking was a cause of lung cancer.  And Leroy

11 Burney, the Surgeon General of the United States, put

12 out the first statement from the U.S. Public Health

13 Service in 1957 indicating that cigarette smoking was

14 causally related to lung cancer.

15           So those events in the United States �

16 similar events were happening in Europe.  And in the

17 spring of 1958 three of the senior scientists from

18 British American Tobacco � they were the parent

19 company for Brown and Williamson � came to the United

20 States to assess what the views were of the major

21 cigarette companies, as well as leading researchers in

22 the field, as to the evidence as to whether smoking was

23 a proven cause of cancer, among other things.  That was

24 one of the areas that actually outlined the reasons why

25 they came over, and that was the first reason, was to

Q.    And let's take a look who was visited, including among those who were visited I should say. American Tobacco Company. A.    Right.  Those are � Dr. Hanmer was the director of research at American Tobacco. Q.    Liggett and Myers.

A.    Right.  Dr. Darkis was the director of research at Liggett and Myers.

Philip Morris we have Dr. O'Keefe and Dr. Seligman, who were � Dr. Seligman was the vice president for research and development at Philip Morris.

A.D. Little, Dr. Kensler, they were a

15 major � they were an independent contractor, but they

did mainly biological and health research for Liggett and Myers Tobacco Company.

You have the TIRC so the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

Came to Roswell Park and met with Fred Bach. Fred Bach is the guy at Roswell that I replaced when I went there.

And Sloan-Kettering where Dr. Wynder was at that time.

And if you go down the page a little bit

1677 further, they met with Dr. Clarence Cook Little.  You

piece in 1955 from Dr. DuPuis.  He was the first director, external scientific director for the TIRC.

And then you had the scientific advisory board of the TIRC.

So these were the supposedly independent scientists, many of whom were quite esteemed in their areas of medicine and science who did the review of some of the grants for TIRC.  So they met.

People at Johns Hopkins, the National Cancer Institute.  There was about � over 40 people. Q.    And with the exception of only one,

14 Mr. Greene, what was � what did � regarding the

question of causation of lung cancer, what did these folks say?

A.    Yeah, so that was the first question.  They said, what's the view of these people on the issue of whether it's been proven that cigarette causes lung cancer?

And they said, "With the exception of one individual, Harry Greene," he was a pathologist at Yale University, "the individuals whom we met believe that smoking causes lung cancer if by causation we mean any chain of events which leads finally to lung cancer and

which involves smoking as an indispensable link.  In the U.S. only Berkson," who was a statistician, "apparently is now prepared to doubt the statistical evidence, and his reasoning is nowhere thought to be sound. "

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, can we read the next sentence about the National Cancer Institute?

THE COURT:  You may.

THE WITNESS:  "Hueper of the National Cancer Institute accepts that cigarette smoke is capable of causing lung cancer but believes that, as compared to other environmental carcinogens, the contributions of smoking to the total mortality of lung cancer is being greatly exaggerated." BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Now, the sentence we just read was someone from the National Cancer Institute, right? A.    That's right. Q.    But the first sentence we read is what the

22 members of this conspiracy believed, right?

A.    That's right.  Everybody believed, except for one individual that they met with, Harry Greene, that cigarettes cause lung cancer.  How much they

1679 contributed to lung cancer, I guess Dr. Hueper is not willing to say that it's the major cause at this point, but it's a cause.  So there wasn't a doubt about whether cigarette smoking caused lung cancer in 1958. They all knew it.

Q.    Right.  There wasn't a doubt in these cigarette conspirators' mind about the cause of lung cancer.

A.    That's right.

Q.    You introduced � well, we've referenced a Liggett and Myers and the fact that they weren't a part of the original TIRC in 1958 but ultimately they joined an entity in 1958.  Tell us about that, please.

A.    Sure.  In the letter from Ed Darr to Paul Hahn in 1957, which we saw, that letter goes on to suggest that they should create another organization to speak on issues related to tobacco and health independent of the TIRC.  And in January of 1958 they incorporated the Tobacco Institute.  It was the communications committee of the TIRC.  It was split off.  The budget from TIRC was reduced by a certain amount of money that went over to fund the Tobacco Institute.  And really from 1958 onward you have a consistent voice speaking on behalf of all their

25 members.

1680 And Liggett and Myers joined the Tobacco Institute, which meant that they funded the Tobacco Institute activities.  And later they joined the Council for Tobacco Research to fund what they refer to as special projects.  Those were the projects selected by the lawyers rather than the scientists.

Q.    You alluded to in the previous document Arthur Little.  And do we have a document, PT 2138, entitled "L&M - A Perspective Review"? A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  At this time we'd offer 2138, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 2138 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And L&M, what is that short for? A.    Liggett and Myers.  And this is their contract lab.  You can see it in their annual reports; they talk about funding Arthur D. Little and the research that they were doing for them and their statements publicly in their annual stockholder reports that it hadn't been proven that smoking caused disease.

Q.    And so Arthur D. Little is doing work on behalf of Liggett.

1681 A.    Yes.

Q.    And what is written here, Dr. Cummings? A.    Yeah, 1961 what they're saying, "There are biologically active materials present in cigarette tobacco.  These are, A, cancer causing; B, cancer promoting; C, poisonous; D, stimulating, pleasurable and flavorful."

Q.    Who is Dr. Wakeham?

A.    Helmut Wakeham.  He replaced Dr. DuPuis as a director of research at Philip Morris.  So Dr. DuPuis left Philip Morris in 1960 and Helmut Wakeham, who had come to Philip Morris in the '50s, becomes the director of research.

Q.    And before we leave this document, so in 1961 did Liggett know that cigarettes caused cancer? MS. LUTHER:  Objection, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Again, I sustain the objection the way it's phrased.  If you want to ask him his with respect to his review of the historical documents that's another thing. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Based upon your review of the documents, do you have an opinion as to whether in 1961 Liggett had an internal recognition of cigarettes as a cause of cancer?

Q.    Prior to 1998 or late 1990s did any of the other cigarette co-conspirators come out and say what was stated at least in the 1958 document we saw earlier about the causation of cancer? A.    No.

Q.    At any time over the 50-year period could any of these cigarette co-conspirators told the public, including Mary Cooper, what they knew about the dangers � internally about the dangers of cigarette smoking?

MR. PEDROSA:  Objection, repetitive and argumentative.

THE COURT:  Yes, I'll let you answer that one more time.

We have covered this topic.  So I'll ask you to move on, Mr. Bass.

But you can answer it one more time. THE WITNESS:  Yes, they could have. THE COURT:  Mr. Bass, you have about three minutes.  We'll take our afternoon break at fifteen till, please.

1683 MR. BASS:  Yes, Your Honor.

BY MR. BASS:

Q.    We introduced Dr. Wakeham before.  Are you familiar with a 1961 presentation to the R&D committee by Dr. Wakeham?

A.    I am.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 3681 into evidence. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 3681 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And what does this document reflect, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Well, it's a presentation that Dr. Wakeham gives to the R&D committee at Philip Morris in their headquarters in New York City.  And he's talking about the smoking and health situation.  So he reviews evidence on carcinogens in tobacco and their ability to remove them.

Q.    Here he indicates carcinogen, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And it says there in some scientific language, but essentially carcinogen means cancer-causing, right?

A.    That's right.  The definition they were using there, because there's a table that follows, are based on the animal mouse-painting experiments.

Q.    So as you say, a table follows.  Is that a partial list of compounds in cigarette smoke also identified as cancer-causing or carcinogens?

A.    Yes.  So now the chemistry has advanced, the methodology for identifying and isolating carcinogens has been well worked out.  They're identifying many different classes of harmful chemicals that cause cancer.  This is just a partial list.  And then they're scoring them.  The plus signs are relating to the biological activity.  A fancy way of saying propensity of the tar when painted onto the animal that produce the tumors.

Q.    If we go to page, what's marked as page 20 of the document, what is written and acknowledged here?

A.    Well, here he's talking about, you know, we know there are carcinogens in the tobacco and how do we get them out?

And what Dr. Wakeham is telling his R&D committee is that "Carcinogens are found in practically every class of compound in the smoke," so not just polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  There are a whole bunch of other classes of harmful chemicals that have

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=477
6 methods that they have in the early '60s, like filters,

7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1685 carcinogens.  "And this fact prohibits complete solution of the problem by eliminating only one or two classes of compounds.  And the present technology does not permit selective filtration of particulate smoke." So they're basically saying with the present

they can't fix the problem.  They can't remove the carcinogens like Dr. DuPuis had said they would.

Q.    How does that acknowledgment contrast with the advertisements regarding filters that we saw earlier?

A.    It's direct contradiction to what the advertisements portrayed with the filters and what the public believed.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, getting ready to go on to another document.

THE COURT:  We'll take our afternoon break, folks.  We'll be in recess till five after three, 20 minutes.  Don't discuss the case at all during the recess.  See you back in 20 minutes.

1       do everybody else, the jury is rapidly

5       going to cut you off.  It's a lot of information

6       for you all to get through.  You guys just have

7       to pick and choose what you want them to focus

8       on.  So you're probably going to go the rest of

9       the day, right?

10           MR. BASS:  Yes, sir.

11           THE COURT:  Again, you guys do what you want

12       to do on that side, but your jury can only

13       ingest so much.  And I sit here for seven hours

16       down.  I can tell when they're paying attention.

17           So I'd just caution everybody to make sure

18       you focus on what you all want them to focus on.

19       With four defendants and all these issues, they

20       just don't have a grasp of the hypertechnical

21       way you guys present some of this, because you

22       guys have been doing it, presume they know

23       something when they don't.  So do what you want

24       to do, but just keep that in mind as you

25       continue to go on.

1           MR. PEDROSA:  Judge, I have one quick issue

2       that I'd like to take up.  It won't take more

3       than two minutes.  If we can excuse

4       Dr. Cummings.

5           THE COURT:  Dr. Cummings, we'll see you in

6       20 minutes, sir.

7            (Witness exited courtroom.)

8           MR. PEDROSA:  Judge, Mr. Bass has built the

9       word "conspiracy," "conspirator" or

10       "co-conspirator" now into at least 15 questions.

11       At this point I think we've crossed into

12       argument.  And what that is is just continuing

13       argument.  So I would ask that the question

14       remain factual and that he refrain from building

15       in "conspiracy" or "conspirator" into the

16       questions.

17           THE COURT:  We'll see.  I don't know what

18       the questions are.  Make a contemporaneous

19       objection.  Conspiracy is part of the legal

20       instructions in the case, unfortunately, for

21       your side.  See what the questions are and I'll

22       rule on them one by one.  I'm not going to make

23       a blanket ruling on what anybody can say in a

24       trial.

4       if they want to put in documents, if there's a

1691 Mr. Bass, you may continue. MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor. May it please the Court? Good afternoon. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, we spent some time earlier talking about public messages and advertisements regarding filters, right? A.    Yes.

Q.    Have you seen internal company documents regarding filtered cigarettes? A.    Sure.

Q.    Are you familiar with a document called "Market potential of a health cigarette" written by

15 M.E. Johnson, Junior?

A. Myron Johnson from Philip Morris, 1966. It's a study of the market potential for a health cigarette, a big review that they did.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 3678 into evidence. THE COURT:  It's in.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 3678 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

1692 document.

A.    Yes, it is.

Q.    And let's see what is written about filters. "The illusion of filtration is as important as the fact of filtration."

Did I read that right? A.    Yes.  This is one of their � this is in the executive summary as one of the key summary points.

Q.    What does that mean, Dr. Cummings, the illusion of filtration?

MR. DAVIS:  Objection to the testimony about meaning and intent.

THE COURT:  You can give your version of it, but you can't interpret what the meaning of the document is.

Go ahead, sir. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Do you have an opinion as to what is meant by illusion of filtration?

A.    My opinion of that is that it's the perception that you're getting a product that is filtering something out of the product rather than the fact that it actually would be filtering something out. So the perception is more important than the reality. Q.    Did they ever � did the cigarette

A.    No.

Q.    Earlier in discussing filters we talked about the fact that now there's evidence that they're

MR. PEDROSA:  Objection, leading � MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  The time frame.  I'd like to be heard on this.

THE COURT:  Rephrase your question and start again. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    We discussed earlier about whether filters actually decrease disease risk. A.    We did.

Q.    Were there � have you seen internal company documents discussing internally whether filtered cigarettes actually were effective? A.    Yes.

Q.    Who is Ernest Pepples?

A.    He was chief general counsel, so the head lawyer for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company in the 1970s.

Q.    Are you familiar with document 2023?

A.    I am.  That's a 1976 document talking about

1694 the industry's response to the cigarette controversy. MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer 2023 into evidence.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 2023 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Mr. Pepples, was he on any of the various committees of the TIRC or the TI or the CTR?

A.    Yes.  In 1976 it was now called the Council for Tobacco Research, previously had been labeled the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  And, yes, he served on the lawyer committee of that organization.

14 And then he also served on the Tobacco Institute

committee, which sort of oversaw the public statements coming out from the companies.

Q.    And what we've highlighted here is this document reflects upon the industry response to the cigarette health controversy.

A.    Yes.

Q.    Basically includes the question on what we talked about earlier, the tar derby and then the introduction of filter cigarettes, right?

A.    It's talking exactly about what the industry did.  They produced more filter brands and brands with

1695 lower tar delivery.  They supported scientific research

to refute unfavorable findings or at a minimum to keep the scientific question open.  They conducted an information campaign against claims by the antismoking lobby and voluntarily met some of the demands of the antismoking lobby, such as agreeing to publish the FTC ratings on tar and nicotine in cigarette advertising.

Q.    And on the next page does Mr. Pepples address this notion of whether or not filters actually were working?

A.    Yes, he does.

It says, "The new filter brands vying for a piece of the growing filter market made extraordinary claims.  And some claim to possess the least tar.  In

15 most cases, however, the smoker of a filtered cigarette

was getting as much or more nicotine and tar as he would have gotten from a regular cigarette.  He had abandoned the regular cigarette, however, on the ground of reduced risk to health."

Q.    We talked about Mr. Pepples being a lawyer.

21 What were the lawyers' role on the various committees

of the TIRC, CTR and/or TI?

A.    Well, they had different roles, but the chief general counsels of each of the companies were assigned to what they call a law committee or the

1696 committee on counsel, which was really the most powerful part of the TI, the Tobacco Institute and the CTR, because they oversaw every word that came out of those organizations and they were responsible for all of the policies, the hiring.  And essentially the executive committees, which was the heads of the company, they would come in and approve the budgets and they would meet less frequently.  So it was really the law committee that was running the show for the companies.

Q.    How long did the committee of counsel last?

A.    It existed during the entire time that the organization, from 1954 when the TIRC was announced to when it went out of business in 1998.

Q.    We know that in 1964 the Surgeon General's Report � or the advisory committee to the Surgeon General issued the report, correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Did the advisory counsel reach out to cigarette companies when putting together the report?

A.    Sure.  All of the companies, the advisory committee when it was formed in 1962, actually at the request of John F. Kennedy.  He was asked at a press event about a report that had come out of Great Britain out of the Royal College of Physicians saying that

1697 smoking caused disease.  He said, I didn't know anything about that, but I'd have our Surgeon General look into it.  Two weeks later Luther Terry, then Surgeon General, announces the formation of this advisory committee to look into that issue.  And during that period from 1962 until the report came out in 1964, you know, the committee deliberated and asked each of the cigarette companies to share every and all research that would be relevant to their deliberations on the health risks of smoking.

Q.    And did the cigarette companies share all of their internal information with the Surgeon General?

A.    Well, we now know that they did not, based on the internal business records.  They certainly did share some information, but not all of the information they had, and particularly some very relevant information was not shared.

Q.    Do we have an example which includes the Philip Morris submission to the Surgeon General?

A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 2817 into evidence. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 2817 was received in evidence.)

169 BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And this is the cover page of what was prepared by Philip Morris and sent to the Surgeon General, correct?

A.    To the advisory committee, yes. Q.    And the next page is actually a letter to the advisory committee, right?

A.    Yes, to Jim Hundley, who was the Assistant Surgeon General at the time.

Q.    It says, "None of the chemical substances listed therein to our knowledge has been found by scientific research to be harmful to the health of the smoker in amounts reported in smoke.  It is possible, of course, to modify the chemical composition of cigarette smoke by the use of filters." Did I read that right? A.    You did.

Q.    And so what are they saying here to the advisory committee of the Surgeon General?

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, the document speaks for itself.

THE COURT:  Sustained.  Rephrase. Sustained.  Rephrase. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Is this touting filtered cigarettes?

1699 MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  Same objection.

THE COURT:  Sustained as leading.  Sustained as leading. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Was it possible to modify the chemical composition of cigarette smoke by the use of filters at that time?

A.    No, it was not.  Based on the findings from Dr. Wakeham to the research and development committee a few years earlier he pointed out that they couldn't remove all the harmful chemicals that were found in cigarettes, many of which Dr. Wakeham acknowledged did cause cancer.

Q.    That was the document we saw a few moments ago, 3681, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    So this is a side-by-side comparison of the submission to the Surgeon General and then that 1961 internal document, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    Now, the report comes out in 1964, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    What did the industry do with regards to their public relations campaign after the report was

1700 published?

A.    Well, they picked up and actually invested

industry's position that it hadn't been proven that smoking caused disease, and so they, what they call reestablished the smoking controversy.  And so that's what they did.

Q.    Were they completely honest with the Surgeon General?

A.    No, they were not completely honest with the Surgeon General in, one, they didn't share, like Dr. Wakeham's presentation to the research committee or the internal documents from RJ Reynolds that had concluded that the evidence implicating smoking was overwhelming, the evidence, you know, against that proposition was scant or the conclusions from the British American Tobacco visit document where everybody agreed that smoking caused disease, that was not shared with the Surgeon General's committee.  That evidence was never really seen until the documents became available publicly in the late 1990s.

Q.    Do you have an opinion, Dr. Cummings, on how this lack of candor with the Surgeon General impacted the Surgeon General's message regarding cigarette smoking and health?

1701 MR. DAVIS:  Objection, speculation, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  You can answer the question. Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I mean, obviously the Surgeon General's committee was reviewing what they knew, what was shared with them.  And, you know, they didn't know what the companies had known or there would have been no controversy, because there really was no controversy about whether smoking caused cancer or was addictive. Again, their internal business records talking about their product being addictive, and that research was not turned over to the Surgeon General either.  And the Surgeon General in '64 concluded under the current definitions that cigarettes were not addictive.  It was a habit, not a physiological addiction.  And that certainly had big implications for smokers in this country. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    As part of the conspiracy, did lawyers actually write scientific publications? A.    Yes. Q.    Please explain.

1702 A.    Well, there's a white paper that was issued in 1954, I think I mentioned that, the cigarette controversy was put out by the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.  It was written by Tommy Ross, who was a lawyer for American Tobacco.  He's actually described in the December 15th meeting minutes from the Plaza Hotel where they wrote the white paper and issued that as the industry's position.  So before any research had ever been done by TIRC, they were already issuing a white paper, and that white paper was all slanted to say it's unknown whether smoking causes disease.  They were all really citing research that was favorable to the industry's position.

And they continued to put out white papers from 1968 through 1984 questioning the link between smoking and disease.  And, in fact, those white papers often were issued the day before a Surgeon General's Report would come out as a way of countering the

19 message coming out from the public health community.

So that wasn't really cooperating with medical authorities as they had promised.

Q.    Now, we've shown some documents that show some internal knowledge on topics that we've discussed.

24 And we've shown some examples of public statements,

right?

1703 A.    Right.

Q.    Have you seen internal documents recognizing that, in fact, the industry was making false statements?

A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 2130 into evidence. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 2130 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    This is a Tobacco Institute memorandum, right?

A.    Yes.  This is written from William Kloepfer to the president of the Tobacco Institute, Earl Clemens, who is a former U.S. senator.  And he became the president of the Tobacco Institute.  And they're talking about the campaign that they had sort of scaled up after the Surgeon General's Report to reestablish the cigarette controversy, the white papers they were putting out, some of the press statements that they were doing.  And Mr. Kloepfer is pointing out to

23 Mr. Clemens that "Our basic position in the cigarette

controversy is subject to the charge, and may be subject to a finding, that we are making false or

1 [misleading statements to promote the sale of

2 cigarettes."

3     Q.    Has the industry ever publicly acknowledged

4 that they ever made any false or misleading statements

5 to promote the sale of cigarettes?

6     A.    No.

7     Q.    Is PT 718 another example of an internal recognition about the purpose and intent of the

9 campaign of doubt?

10     A.    I'm assuming you're referencing the Roper

11 proposal, 1972, written by Mr. Kloepfer � or Panzer to

12 Kloepfer rather.

13     Q.    We're not there yet.  That's a couple

14 documents away

15     A.    I don't have the numbers of your exhibits in

16 my head, sorry

Q.    That's okay.  It's on your monitor.

A.    Okay.  Yeah, I got it.

Q.    What is PT 718?

A.    This is a Brown and Williamson document.  It was part of a campaign that Brown and Williamson had created called Project Truth, which was part of a public relations campaign that was launched from 1969 and ran through 1971.  And they talk about what the purpose of the campaign is going to be.  That's what

1705 this document is talking about.

Q.    And you referred to it as a campaign of doubt.  What do you mean by that?

A.    I mean it was a campaign to keep open the notion there was a controversy that smoking caused disease and to create doubt in the public's mind about whether smoking did cause disease.  All you needed to do was give the smoker just a little bit of a thread of doubt so they would keep puffing away.  And that was, in fact, the goal of what they defined as the cigarette controversy.  So the word "doubt" is not something that actually is a word that I used.  It's actually a word that's in their own business records.  They use it.

Q.    What is cognitive dissidence, Dr. Cummings?

A.    It's a theory in psychology when you hold two opposing beliefs that you need to resolve the psychic tension that comes about when, for example, you

18 might buy a car, it's really a lemon, but you sort of

convince yourself that it was really a good deal because you've got this tension, and so you come up with excuses to allow you to say, this is the greatest car ever.

And so with smoking, very relevant to, you know, a smoker because they often come up with excuses and denials, well, you know, they just don't know that

1706 smoking causes disease.  They're exaggerating the health effects, or I'll quit before it's too late, to try to reduce the information you may be hearing on the other side that says, you know, you keep smoking, you know, it could be really bad for your health.  And so it is one of the factors that we see in drug addiction.

Drug addiction causes people to deny the health risks and it impairs rational thought.  That's what addiction does.  And cognitive dissidence is a theory that helps explain what essentially becomes irrational behavior when you sort of just step back and look at it independently.

Q.    Let's look at what's written in PT 718 at page 12 of the document.

MR. BELASIC:  Subject to Banks redaction.

THE COURT:  Subject to those redactions it will be in evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 718 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    It's written here, "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public. It is also the means of establishing a controversy."

Did I read that right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Now, was there information in the public about the dangers of cigarette smoking?

A.    Sure.  You know, this is the late 1960s. The Surgeon General's Report had come out.  There were actually public service ads that were running on television at that point telling people about the health risks of smoking, which actually caused a lot of people to try to quit smoking.  In fact, you see a real � a dip or an increase in the number of people quitting smoking between 1967 and 1970, that period when the antismoking ads ran on television as a result of what was referred to as The Fairness Doctrine.

And so there was information getting out. So to keep the controversy alive the idea was to create a campaign of doubt.  Doubt is the product of the campaign.  That's the thing that they want to plant in the public's mind to keep people smoking.

Q.    Did the campaign of doubt continue into the 1970s?

A.    It did.  This was part of the campaign called Project Truth.  Part of that campaign was issuing the white papers.  They had public service ads to promote those white papers on television.  And they would say, not that the companies denied, but they

would say, leading scientists who denied.  What we now know is many of those leading scientists were on the payroll of the cigarette companies.

Q.    Did cigarette companies ever tell Mary Cooper that doubt was their product?

MR. PEDROSA:  Objection, argument. THE COURT:  Did the companies ever... It's a yes or no answer, sir. THE WITNESS:  No. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Did they ever tell Mary Cooper their intent was to create a controversy?

A.    No.

Q.    You referenced the Roper proposal earlier, Dr. Cummings.  What is the Roper proposal?

A.    This is an internal Tobacco Institute document from Fred Panzer to William Kloepfer.  William Kloepfer was the vice president in charge of public affairs for the Tobacco Institute.  So he was a very high executive really, right below the president of the Tobacco Institute.  And they're talking about the 20-year history of the cigarette controversy and what the goal of that history had been and how successful it had been at creating doubt in the public's mind so that people would keep smoking.

recogn
	itions about the success of

1710 And it says, "For nearly 20 years this industry has employed a single strategy to defend itself on three major fronts, litigation, politics and public opinion.  While the strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed over the years, helping us win important battles, it is only fair to say that it is not, nor was it intended to be, a vehicle for victory. On the contrary, it has always been a holding strategy consisting of creating doubt about the health charge without actually denying it."

Did I read that right? A.    Yes.

Q.    Do you have an opinion based upon your education, training and experience and review of internal documents about what a holding strategy is? MR. BELASIC:  Objection, calls for interpretation, speculation.

THE COURT:  I'll let him answer that question.  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yeah, they're basically trying to hold the ability of smokers to keep buying their cigarettes and keep their market viable. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    What's the truth squad, Dr. Cummings? A.    The truth squad were the paid public

1711 relations specialists who were hired, and there were probably half a dozen of them who went all over the country, appeared on radio, television shows, quoted in newspapers, and they created the truth campaign and they had the truth squad.  So these were paid public relations specialists who worked for the Tobacco Institute and they would show up, you know, if you had a debate going on on a radio show or television they would often be there to appear there to give their position.  I dealt with a number of them during my time in the 1980s when I was at Roswell Park.

Q.    And do we have a montage of clips from various members of the tobacco industry truth squad giving the public position about the industry's belief whether cigarette smoking causes disease?

A.    Yes.  This is the we don't know compendium, because that was the consistent message.  We don't know whether smoking causes disease.  It's a controversy.

19 More research is needed.  And I believe this montage

goes from the mid 1970s through 1990s, if I recall correctly.

Q.    Did they know, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Sure, they knew.  They knew by 1958. Everybody agreed that smoking caused cancer.

Q.    So these clips that we saw, that takes us into the 1990s, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Now, we talked a little earlier about cognitive dissidence.  Was Mary Cooper an addicted smoker?

A.    Yes, she was.

Q.    What is the CTR, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Council for Tobacco Research.  It was the � previously was known as the Tobacco Industry Research Committee created in 1954.  It changed its name in

18 March of 1964 to Council for Tobacco Research to

eliminate the use of the term "Tobacco Industry Research Committee" so instead they called themselves the Council for Tobacco Research to distance themselves from the link to the industry, although they didn't change their structure.  Still had the executive committee of the major companies, the lawyers running the show, the lawyers selecting some of the research

Q. Have you seen documents that are internal recognitions about the real purpose of TIRC and the CTR?

A.    Yeah, there are many internal documents that talk about it being a public relations gesture and so on.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we would offer PT 2268 into evidence. THE COURT:  In evidence.

Q. What was the meeting in New York November 15th, 1978, Dr. Cummings?

A.    This was a meeting of the lawyers, the ad hoc committee, which was a subcommittee of the lawyer committee that met.  So internal industry people talking about CTR, not the scientists who were independent on their advisory board, but, in fact, talking about the workings of the CTR and what its real purpose was for the industry.

So you can see the various people. Dr. Seligman is vice president for research at Philip Morris.  And he attended the meeting, and these

Q.    And it goes on to list everyone who was there, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And among them we have Mr. Pepples again, general counsel Brown and Williamson, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Mr.  Tucker, general counsel RJ Reynolds.

A.    That's right.

Q.    Tim Fennigan, another lawyer.

A.    Yeah, outside counsel.

Q.    Bill Shinn, I believe was a lawyer, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Arnold Henson, a lawyer, right?

A.    Yep.  Chief general counsel for American Tobacco.

Q.    Janet Brown, retained counsel.

A.    Yes, she was the outside counsel to the CTR.

Q.    Then we have other executives of the other companies that were there, correct?

A.    That's right.  So this is a high level � these were high level executives with the companies.

Q.    What role did lawyers play in the conspiracy, Dr. Cummings?

THE COURT:  Rephrase the question.  It's too broad.  Sustain the objection. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Did lawyers � were lawyers � let me ask you this.  Who were those lawyers up there, and what role did they have at this particular meeting?

A.    Well, they were the � in some instances they were chief general counsel or retained counsel to the companies themselves, so they came from other firms who represented the companies.  And they're basically outlining the strategy for the, in this case they're talking about the Council for Tobacco Research.  There was a similar group, in fact, a lot of overlap in the group for the lawyers who oversaw the Tobacco Institute.  So they had a similar, you know, operating structure.

Q.    And what role did lawyers play in putting out and helping put out the industry message?

A.    They basically approved every statement that came out.  I mean, they oversaw the statements.  So you had the industry speaking with a single voice rather than having different voices.  For the most part that was their goal.  And to stay on mission in terms of what that statement would be, to keep the controversy

Q.    Let's see what's written here about the real purpose of TIRC and CTR.  As a means of introduction, Bill Shinn described the history, particularly in relation to CTR.  "CTR began as an organization called Tobacco Industry Research Council [sic] (TIRC).  It was set up as an industry shield in 1954." Did I read that right? A.    Yes.

Q.    Now, earlier on I think you used that word "shield" �

A.    That's right.

Q.    � in describing the TIRC.  Is this one of the documents where you got that word from? A.    Yes.

Q.    That was the year statistical accusations relating to smoking were levelled at the industry. Litigation began when the Wynder/Graham reports were issued.  CTR has helped �

MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, I object we need to get that down and we need to address this at sidebar.

MR. BASS:  Thank you. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    "CTR has supplied spokesmen for the industry at congressional hearings.  The money spent at CTR

3 moneys are spent.  On these projects CTR has acted as a

provides a base for introduction of witnesses.  Bill Shinn feels that special projects are the best way that

front.  However, there are times when CTR has been reluctant to serve in that capacity, and in rare instances they have refused to serve in that capacity."

"It was at this time that special projects were instituted at Washington University, Harvard University, and UCLA.  Bill Shinn noted that the industry received a major public relations plus when

Did I read that right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    What are special projects that are referred to there, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Sure.  Again, when TIRC was announced in 1954, they talked about having independent scientists who would select the research.  And they did have an advisory group and had a category of research that they funded that was selected by that advisory group, much of it had nothing to do with smoking and health but it was done that way.

And then there were special projects created in the mid 1960s, what he's referring to.  Those were selected by the lawyers.  It didn't go through a peer

1722 review by scientists.  They were really selected to try to create evidence to refute the charges that smoking caused disease, to attack the science that was coming out.  That was the priority of the science from special projects.  So it wasn't independent research.  It was industry directed research, and they used CTR as a front.  And that was a direct contradiction to the original articles of incorporation of TIRC that was shared with the Department of Justice.

Q.    Who is Ed Horrigan, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Ed Horrigan was the president of RJ Reynolds in the 1980s.  I think we saw a clip of him in that we-don't-know segment.

So in 1984 he was the president of RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company and helped sponsor the Open Debate Campaign which Reynolds launched.  It was really when they ended the cigarette controversy documents in '84 that were published by TI, Reynolds went out and continued it with what they referred to as the open debate campaign.

Q.    I think when we were talking about youth

22 marketing we introduced an ad that was part of the open

debate campaign from 1984, right? A.    Correct. Q.    Are you familiar with Mr. Horrigan on the

MR. BELASIC:  No objection if we can play our portions, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  You may do that as well.  In evidence subject to that.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 1751AA was received in evidence.)

(Video clip was played and taken down to the best of the reporter's ability as follows:)

VOICE: Earlier this week the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company took out this ad in a number of major newspapers and magazines calling for an open debate about smoking. In brief, the ad contends that medical studies which show that cigarette smoking causes disease are ignoring significant evidence to the contrary.

VOICE:  Cigarette smoking does not cause cancer, yes or no?

VOICE:  It is not known whether cigarettes cause cancer.  It has not been causally established.

VOICE:  Despite all of the research to date, there has been no causal link established. VOICE:  No causal relationship between cigarette smoking and heart disease.

VOICE: No, as a matter of fact, there are studies that while we are accused of being associated with heart disease, there have been studies conducted over 10 years that would say again that science is still puzzled over these forces.

(Video clip concluded.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Now, remind us what year that was, Dr. Cummings?

A.    That was '84.

Q.    And is there evidence, case specific evidence in the record that Mary Cooper recalls seeing

20 Mr. Horrigan on Ted Koppel ABC Nightline in 1984?

A.    There is evidence that she saw this debate. I think she referred to in the mid 1980s and then her daughter Jacqueline I believe in her deposition remembered that she and her mom had watched the president of RJ Reynolds on television and she thought

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

10 messages coming out on the health risks of smoking, and

11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1725 it was Ted something, Ted Koppel being the announcer of

the show.  So there's recall of specifically this

appearance.

Q.    Was Mary Cooper smoking RJ Reynolds' products at this time?

A.    Yes.

Q.    In your review of the case specific records, did Mary say how seeing this impacted her?

A.    Yes.  Basically said there were mixed

she commented that she had seen those and that that sort of allayed concerns that she had.

Q.    As an addicted smoker, how did cognitive dissidence effect Mary Cooper?

A.    Like many smokers, gave her an excuse to keep smoking.  Had there been no controversy I think a lot more people would have stopped.

Q.    Did every cigarette that Mary Cooper smoked contribute to her addiction?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Did every cigarette that Mary Cooper smoked contribute to her cancer?

A.    Yes.

Q.    How?  How did every cigarette that Mary Cooper smoked contribute to her addiction?

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=518
25

1726

1     A.    Well, it maintains the addiction.  So, I

2 mean, it's just refueling the addiction that she had.

3 And if you � so that keeps you smoking and then keeps

4 the exposure to the other chemicals in cigarettes,

5 which is why addiction is what leads inevitably to the

6 diseases that are caused by smoking, which is why one

7 out of two people who are addicted to cigarettes get

8 sick from smoking.

9     Q.    Did every cigarette she smoked substantially

10 contribute to her cancer?

11     A.    Yes.

12           MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  That's medical

13       testimony.  Outside the scope of the expertise.

14           THE COURT:  Objection is overruled.

15           THE WITNESS:  Yes, it did.  Every cigarette,

16       every puff of a cigarette does cellular damage.

17       And you accumulate that damage which leads to

18       the disease.

19 BY MR. BASS:

20     Q.    Mr. Horrigan's message in 1984 was similar

21 to the we-don't-know message of the tobacco industry �

22 to the Tobacco Institute truth squad, correct?

23     A.    Yeah, it was a continuation of that same

24 message that had started in 1954 and continued right

through 1985 with the open debate and continued

A.    He's in the legal department at RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company.

Q.    And are you familiar with a document from December 18th, 1968 regarding the invalidation of some reports in the research department?

A.    Yes.  This is a note from Murray Sankus, the head of research and development at the time in the late, I think it's 1969, for RJ Reynolds to Max Crohn actually responding to a note that he had gotten from

19 Mr. Crohn about how to invalidate certain reports in

the research files.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT 2181 into evidence.

MR. BELASIC:  Subject to Banks redactions. May I ask, Your Honor, is this the entire document?

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 2181 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    December 18, 1969 there we see Mr. Max Crohn, legal department, Re:  Invalidation of some reports in the research department.  "We do not foresee any difficulty in the event a decision is reached to remove certain reports from research files.  As an alternative to invalidation, we can have the authors rewrite those sections of the reports which appear objectionable."

Did I read that right? A.    Yes.  That was one of the methods. Q.    What were some of the other methods? A.    Well, they could remove, you know, actual reports, so just eliminate those that were, what they referred to as being repetitive.

So if you put them up there, I think there's a list of five different methods that they talk about. VIDEO TECH:  That's not in this document. THE WITNESS:  Yeah, it is.  If you just take off the bottom.  There it is.  There you go. So discoveries are inaccuracy in data,

1729 erroneous interpretation, purposeless speculation on data, needless repetition of reports, undue delay in finalizing reports, confidentiality of contents and several miscellaneous reasons, among others. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Do you know whether documents had been destroyed?

A.    Yes, there are internal business records that talk about destroying documents.  So the answer is yes .

Q.    What is mutagenicity?

A.    That's where you cause DNA damage to a cell. Q.    Do you know whether the companies were studying mutagenicity?

A.    Yes, they were.

Q.    Have you seen documents where company employees were forbidden from studying mutagenicity? A.    Yes.

Q.    Is PT 1201 an example of one? A.    Yes.

MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor, let's move on. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    What is INBIFO, Dr. Cummings? A.    It was a contract lab over in Europe that was funded by � or purchased by Philip Morris in the late 1960s for the purposes of doing research on the health risks of smoking biological effects of cigarettes that was done outside the company.  That was the purpose.

Q.    Why was this being done in Europe?

MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  This is subject to limitations in Banks that you ruled upon.

THE COURT:  Again, Mr. Davis, the issues in Banks were documents, not my rulings.  You'll have to come sidebar, sir.

(The following discussion was held at sidebar:)

MR. DAVIS:  Your Honor, this is not a redaction issue.  This is a limitation on the use of two documents 2201 and 1592 in Banks. You ruled that these documents and INBIFO could

1       be introduced only for the purpose of showing

2       that there was research on addiction and

3       causation done overseas and in no way to be

4       discussed or testimony about it being a shield

5       for litigation or hiding.  And it was concerning

6       to me because he just said, What was the purpose

7       of this?  I don't know if Dr. Cummings is aware

8       of that limitation and that's why I raised it.

9           MR. GDANSKI:  That's a fair point.  I think

10       what Mr. Davis just said is accurate actually.

11       The documents are admissible.  We can discuss

12       the concept of INBIFO generally but Your Honor

13       did not allow us to tie it up to any type of

14       litigation.

15           THE COURT:  That's fine, but I want the

16       lawyer who is taking the witness to make the

17       objections.  I don't want him doing something

18       that you're telling me up here.

19           With that caveat, the objection is sustained

20       in part.

21           MR. GDANSKI:  Can we have Hardee tell

22       Dr. Cummings?

23           THE COURT:  I think you better do it in the

24       morning.

(Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the following proceedings were held in open court:)

THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, why don't you all step in the jury room for a couple of minutes while I take care of this and I'11 try not to disturb you any further.

(Jury exited the courtroom at 4:18 p.m.)

THE COURT: Dr. Cummings, would you step in the hallway, please.

Actually, while he's here if you want to finish that topic now that we've broke.

MR. GDANSKI:  I don't need to tell him in open court about it.

THE COURT: What? Yeah, you do. About the other one, not about this. The other one. Are you going to bring that topic up back about the European stuff?

MR. BASS:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  So what is it that we discussed at sidebar that we're going to make sure he doesn't say.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'll just make sure both Hardee and Dr. Cummings know.

THE COURT:  Well, say it, Jon.

2       didn't know if you wanted Hardee to tell him.

3           Dr. Cummings, on the INBIFO stuff we can

4       talk about the fact that there was research done

5       on nicotine addiction at INBIFO paid for by

6       Philip Morris overseas in Germany.  We just

7       can't say that it was done to shield or protect

8       against litigation related risk in this country.

9       So don't tie it to anything to do with

10       litigation in this country, okay?

11           THE WITNESS:  Okay.

12           THE COURT:  Are we okay with that?

13           MR. GDANSKI:  We are.

14           MR. DAVIS:  No hiding, that was the point.

15           THE COURT:  Litigation both sides I've said

16       it out.  Everybody knows that.  Anything to do

17       with litigation, strategies, by the plaintiffs

18       or the defendants in these tobacco cases or

10           THE COURT:  What's defense say?

11           MR. DAVIS:  Well, Your Honor, first of all,

12       and I can only go by the research that we've

13       tried to do, I show that this document has never

14       been admitted by you at all.  I mean, I've got a

15       complete blank �

16           THE COURT:  I only admitted it one time and

17       that was Banks.

18           MR. DAVIS:  I do not show that, Your Honor,

19       that's all I'm saying.  Factually I would like

20       to look into that, because I �

21           MR. BELASIC:  Just to clarify in case

22       there's confusion.  So we've got it was not

23       admitted in one place.  We've got it with a

24       different number that I've never heard of that

25       says Banks redactions.  So I don't want to

173;

1       misrepresent anything to the Court.

2           MR. DAVIS:  I'm working on the exhibit

3       number that they have here and it doesn't show

4       it.  But, Your Honor, I mean, at some point

5       we've just got to stop.  The 2014 report is 13

6       years after she quit smoking.  And it just

7       cannot in terms of the prejudicial effect of

8       that document compared to the probative value of

9       anything relating to her smoking before she quit

10       in '01 and is cumulative of all that we've heard

11       so far, it just seems to me it's got to stop.

12       It just should not come in �

13           THE COURT:  Well, these conclusions from the

14       Surgeon General's Report as far as inflammatory

15       or prejudicial evidence is minuscule compared to

16       the internal documents of the tobacco

17       companies �

18           MR. DAVIS:  Maybe I'm not � compared to the

19       what, sir?

20           THE COURT:  Compared to the internal

21       documents that are prejudicial to you on your

22       side.  So in that respect that objection by

23       itself would be denied.

24           However, there's two issues on this.  One,

25       it is remote in time to the time in which she

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=531
1739

1       stopped smoking, but, two, anticipating

2       testimony from your side which they can't �

3       they can only rebut when they're in their case,

4       it has been repeatedly testified to by

5       executives from the defense side in the trials

6       I've presided over that the companies on their

7       websites tell the consumers, for information

8       regarding the dangers of smoking and whether you

9       should or shouldn't smoke we refer you to the

10       Surgeon General's Reports, the American Cancer

11       Society and other publicly informative places to

12       gain information about smoking as of the year

13       2000.

14           So there's a dichotomy of, one, telling the

15       consumer and your customers or others who are

16       interested in the topic of smoking debate to go

17       to the sources such as the Surgeon General's

18       Report for reliable information and don't rely

19       on what we tell you versus, well, it's

20       inflammatory and it shouldn't be admitted in a

21       case involving litigation over tobacco.

22           MR. DAVIS:  Let me address that, Your Honor.

23       I see your point.  The issue of the testimony

24       that you have heard has been in Phase II.  It

25       must be.  I haven't been before you �

1741

1       cross of Dr. Cummings or Dr. Proctor where

2       there's a confrontation and he's confronted with

3       the website or with the idea and notion that we

4       do now tell smokers to look to the Surgeon

5       General.  So yesterday next door that was �

6           MR. BELASIC:  It didn't happen here.

7           MR. GDANSKI:  It may or may not happen here,

8       but we don't have to worry what you may do.

9           So that's one option.  Number two is this is

10       exactly the phase where it would be admissible.

11       It's the reprehensibility and it's the

12       entitlement to punitive damages.  The jury

13       instruction on punitive damages gives them the

14       ability to argue that punitive damages are not

15       warranted.  They're not warranted and so �

16           THE COURT:  Well, I'm �

17           MR. GDANSKI:  All we're asking for, we

18       respect Your Honor's ruling �

19           THE COURT:  I'm inclined to let some of

20       these conclusions in, but others not.

24           MR. PEDROSA:  I do think this is a Phase II

1       But this is not a rebuttal to the company

2       websites.  This is just pure bolstering of what

3       Dr. Cummings has testified to.  That's the only

4       thing it's relevant to is bolstering of what

5       Dr. Cummings has testified to.  It's not

6       rebuttal to anything on the company websites.

7       It has nothing to do with anything on the

8       company websites.  The fact that the companies

9       refer people to the Surgeon General is simply

10       evidence that we offer in Phase II in mitigation

11       saying, look, there's no need to punish now

12       because now we don't dispute anything the

13       Surgeon General says, we just refer people

14       there.  This doesn't rebut that in any way.  All

15       it does is say, hey, remember everything you

16       just heard from Dr. Cummings?  Guess what?  The

17       Surgeon General of the United States, with all

18       the power of that office, agrees with him.  And

19       that's why you should find that Dr. Cummings is

20       credible.  That's just pure bolstering.

21           MR. GDANSKI:  Your Honor let in this exact

22       page, verbatim exact page, not redacting any of

23       the major conclusions.  You didn't let us put in

24       the entire book, that's your ruling, we put in

25       this exact page in Banks and, quite frankly, it

1       didn't have such a prejudicial impact, let's be

2       honest about that.  But we put in the entire

3       page, this page with the cover, the major

4       conclusions.  And there's nothing about any of

5       these 10 indivisible major conclusions that are

6       overly prejudicial.

7           The only one, quite frankly, that I can

8       see � I don't need to fly speck and find one

9       that maybe arguably has nothing to do with

10       anything, but there's one that I can see maybe

11       doesn't belong in this case.  In any event, the

12       entirety of it should come in.  It's major

13       conclusions from the report �

14           THE COURT:  That's the problem, it's just

15       putting � you have to be careful how you do

16       this, Mr. Gdanski.

17           MR. GDANSKI:  Yes, sir.

18           THE COURT:  They're right to some extent.  I

19       can't just let authoritative scientific journals

20       to bolster the testimony of the witness by mere

21       conclusions.  He can form his opinions.  He can

22       use them as a basis for his opinions, but merely

2       up there and I know how concerned our judges are

3       about this.

4           Could you let me read the other three

5       paragraphs and keep clear for a second, both

6       sides.  I'm going to make a ruling.

7           COURT REPORTER:  Your Honor, can I run to

8       the restroom while you're doing that?

9           THE COURT:  Of course you can.

10            (A discussion was held off the record.)

11           THE COURT:  For the record, while they're

12       reviewing, Madam Reporter, I'm going to permit

13       five paragraphs that I've highlighted that are

14       relevant to this case only.  Other paragraphs

15       are immaterial to this case discussing infant

16       mortality, fetuses, other issues that are either

17       inflammatory or not pertinent to the issues I'm

18       going to frame for the jury.  I've offered the

19       plaintiffs, probably over their objection and

20       defense objection, the alternative to those five

21       paragraphs redacted going in only on the 2014

22       report, because it is nothing more than what the

23       jury has already heard repetitive times over the

24       last 14 hours.  The defense still maintains

25       their objections.  So if the plaintiff doesn't

3           Anything further?

4           MR. GDANSKI:  No, sir.

5           THE COURT:  Do you wish to move in a

6       redacted version of that exhibit, Mr. Gdanski?

7           MR. GDANSKI:  One second, Judge.

8           Yeah, we will move it in.  And, obviously,

9       we reserved our position that it should come in

10       in its entirety.

11           THE COURT:  Okay, Mr. Davis, you maintain

12       you all's objections?

13           MR. DAVIS:  Yes, Your Honor.

14           THE COURT:  Both side preserved their

15       record.

16           MR. HENK:  May I just add one more, Your

17       Honor?

18           THE COURT:  Yes.

19           MR. HENK:  The 20 million number, Your

20       Honor, that says after 1964.  So just as an

21       example somebody who died in 1965 that smoked

22       from 1910 to 1950, there's not even an argument

23       that the companies did anything wrong that

24       contributed to that death, but that death is

25       included in that number.

1           THE COURT:  I'm not sure how that's harmful

2       to you.  And I have listened to the skilled

3       cross-examination of Dr. Cummings by the defense

4       side and I am certain that they're going to

5       point out all of these various things to

6       challenge his credibility and believability.  It

7       is a report promulgated by the Surgeon General

8       that has a degree of reliability and scientific

9       reliability.  And it is referenced on the

10       tobacco companies', almost every one in this

11       case, maybe I'm wrong, because I've reviewed

12       their websites in other cases where they

13       reference to gain information about the subject

14       to go to the Surgeon General's Report.

15           I have taken out the portions that I think

16       are either not relevant or inflammatory.  The

17       portions that are in there are the subject

18       matter which this witness has consistently

19       testified to up till today.  I concede on the

20       tobacco side or the defense side the 2014 is

21       long after she quit smoking, but the totality of

22       the witness' testimony which he can rely upon

23       scientific journals, one of which is referenced

24       in the defendants' own website, to form

3           THE COURT:  This is a pure conclusion.  This

4       is not an opinion.  It's the reference of

5       whoever authored those four paragraphs and

6       that's why I'm not letting it in, Jon.

7           Cummings can say whatever he wants to say,

8       to say that he said it 53 times.

9           I think it is, to this degree I agree with

10       the defense, that paragraph is improper

11       bolstering.  It's a mere conclusion not based on

12       scientific evidence and, therefore, I sustain

13       the objection.

14           MR. GDANSKI:  We can discuss it generally

15       with Dr. Cummings without referencing �

6           Folks, as I said when I gave you my

7       introductory instructions, from time to time

8       during the course of the trial the rules for the

9       trial can be complicated and the lawyers all

10       have their rights to make their objections,

11       because everything I do down here in Fort

12       Lauderdale, Florida can be reviewed by another

13       court.  So don't take anything from that, okay.

14       It's what everybody does in these trials.  It's

15       my job to be the referee.  It's their job to

16       help me through this.  So don't take anything

17       from that.  It happens every trial no matter

18       what kind of case it is.  So we'll weather

19       through it.  And everybody has their right to

20       make their objections.  And both sides will do

21       that.  You'll find the plaintiffs will do it

22       when we get to defense side too.  Nothing

23       harmful about that at all.

Q.    Dr. Cummings, we've spent a while talking about the internal industry knowledge versus the public statements, correct?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And do you base your opinions on, in part, the 2014 Surgeon General's Report?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Okay.  Dr. Cummings, the last topic we're going to talk about is cigarette design and nicotine

A.    Okay.

Q.    And we've discussed some aspects of it throughout your testimony, but do we have a demonstrative PDR 229 to help the jury understand your testimony about how the engineering and design of cigarettes impacts addiction to nicotine? A.    Yes. Q.    If we could publish PDR �

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, last word of flavorings.  We raised this yesterday.  It was supposed to be done.

VIDEO TECH:  It's done. MR. BELASIC:  No objection. THE COURT:  You may show it and it is in evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PDR 229 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q. Okay, Dr. Cummings. If we could, I guess, just walk through this demonstrative and tell us the basis for your opinions that cigarettes are designed to

14 maintain and sustain addiction

A.    Sure.  I mean, they're engineered to deliver a minimum amount of nicotine, that's accomplished through the blending of the tobacco, the type of tobacco that's used.  Different types of tobacco have different amounts of nicotine.

You can take nicotine out, as the companies do, and then put it back to precise specifications as they spray it on what is what I refer to as man-made tobacco called reconstituted tobacco.  Through a variety of things are that illustrated here such as the use of various additives or ingredients such as sugars

1752 and flavorings and levulinic acid, ammonia compounds that affect pH of the smoke, which alters, you know,

Flavorants like menthol reduce harshness.

And so then there's the engineering around the paper and the filter.  And I've discussed some of this previously as to how a filter is constructed and the use of the vent holes which facilitate the way that the person will inhale the cigarette and adjust the nicotine dose.

So you have to have enough nicotine in the product.  You can do things with additives and ingredients that affect the delivery of the nicotine and the efficiency by which nicotine gets into the lungs.  And that's accomplished with the additives and the filtering in the product.  So it's engineered to deliver a sufficient amount of nicotine to keep people smoking.

Q.    We see up on the upper left-hand corner bronchodilators.  What does that mean and how does that feature impact addiction?

A.    Well, bronchodilators affect the airways, the opening of the airways to allow, you know, if you open up the airways you can get more stuff in.  So more smoke gets in the airways.  Also there are chemicals in

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

1753 the smoke that affect some of the cilia that line our airways, paralyze the cilia.  Again, that facilitates

including nicotine into the lungs.

Q.    What's levulinic acid?

A.    That's an acid salt that has been added to some cigarettes, particularly lighter cigarettes, it is to affect pH.  And there's research that shows that the right amount of levulinic acid in the product affects nicotine binding in the brain.  So it facilitates that. So it makes it more likely that the nicotine that enters the system gets into the brain, attaches to those receptor cites in the brain stimulating those neurochemicals.  So that's an additive that's used particularly in light cigarettes.

Q.    Tobacco-specific nitrosamines.  What is that and how does that impact addiction?

A.    Well, it impacts addiction primarily through the fact that one of the ways you get the nitrosamines in the product is to use high-content-nicotine tobacco. The Burley tobacco has a little bit more nicotine than the Turkish or the bright tobaccos that are used.  The side product of that is the nitrosamines themselves, there are a whole host of them are highly potent carcinogens.  So they also increase the risk of getting

1754 cancer.  But you do get the addiction link is because the type of tobacco that's used in the cigarettes. Particularly when they went to the filter blend they started using more of the Burley tobacco in the product and it increased the nitrosamine levels in the cigarettes, which is one of the reasons that cigarettes are more dangerous today.

Q.    How do flavorings impact addiction?

A.    Sure.  Well, there are a lot of flavorings that are talked about in cigarettes, licorice, chocolate, vanilla, a whole host of them.  They even describe things like diammonium phosphate as a flavorant.  But they mask harshness and they mask the bad taste of tobacco to make it easier for people to acquire the cigarette behavior.  So it makes it a more appealing product.

Q.    How does menthol impact the addictiveness of a cigarette?

A.    Menthol is probably the best known the flavors.  Menthol is found in a lot of cigarettes, by the way, even the ones that don't say menthol on it. But there's more menthol, obviously, in the ones where they have it as a part of their marketing, menthol, like a Salem or Belair, Marlboro Menthol.  They're obviously marketing that because it has more menthol.

pgNbr=547
1755

1           But it affects how you inhale the cigarette.

2 So it reduces the harshness by cooling the smoke.  It's

3 not natural.  There's no such thing as menthol tobacco.

4 It's sprayed on the paper.  It's also sprayed on

5 sometimes the tobacco or even added to the filter tip

6 where you can squeeze the filter.  Now they put little

7 beads in the filter.  You can squeeze it, you can get a

8 little rush of menthol along with the smoke.  So that's

9 menthol � its main effect is to reduce harshness

10 making it easier to inhale the smoke.

11     Q.    How long did Mary Cooper smoke menthol

12 cigarettes?

13     A.    Her whole life.  So from the early '60s

14 until she finally quit smoking in 2001.

15     Q.    Ventilated filters.  We talked a little bit

16 about filters.  How did ventilated filters impact

17 addiction?

18     A.    Well, they reduce resistance to draw.  So if

19 you have a filter tip that's not ventilated you have to

20 suck a little harder.  If you put some air holes in it,

21 those little vent holes that I showed earlier, you can

22 take a bigger, deeper puff.  And so it reduces the

23 resistance to draw so you can, you know, essentially

24 allows you to pull easier the smoke deeper into the

25 airways.  So it gives greater exposure to the lungs of

1756 the nicotine which speeds the nicotine delivery to the brain, because it's a larger surface area that's covered.

It also contributes to more mutagenetic tar. So the tar from filter-ventilated cigarettes because of the oxygen mixing with the tar components are more cancer causing.

Q.    For how long did Mary Cooper smoke filtered cigarettes?

A.    All her life.

Q.    Ammonia compounds, how does that impact addiction?

A.    Ammonia affects addiction in a couple of ways, it reduces harshness.  So adding ammonia can actually alter the pH of the smoke and that has some affect on the harshness.  It's a harshness reducer.  It also affects the pH in a way that allows you to get

18 more free nicotine rather than the bound nicotine.  So

it's more readily absorbed.  So it increases the efficiency of the nicotine delivery to the smoker.

Q.    What is the difference between free nicotine and bound nicotine?

A.    Well, you know, nicotine is essentially in its natural state in tobacco leaf is primarily around a pH of about 5.5, 5.8.  Most of it is in its bound form

1757 so it's not so readily absorbed into the bloodstream. But when you increase pH just a little bit you free it up so it's more readily absorbed in the bloodstream, primarily in the mouth so you get more kick or satisfaction with free nicotine.  And it's related to cigarette sales, or at least has been in the period when a lot of the pH manipulation was going on in the '70s and '80s.

Q.    Have you brought along a video that shows a little bit of the manufacturing process of cigarettes? A.    Yes.

Q.    Is that PT 4581A?

A.    Yes.  It's to show that it's a highly automated process.  The use of various additives are reflected.  This is not a natural product.  This is a highly engineered product.

MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor, cumulative and nonresponsive.

THE COURT:  The question is:  Did you bring along a video?  The answer I think is yes. Beyond that we don't need anything further. Do you wish to show the video? MR. BASS:  Yes, sir.  We offer it into evidence, ask to show it.  And there is no sound to it so maybe we ask that Dr. Cummings can

MR. BELASIC:  Is it demonstrative only, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Demonstrative or you move it into evidence?

MR. BASS:  We're offering it into evidence.

THE COURT:  It will be in evidence.  And yes, subject to objection he can.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 4581A was received in evidence.)

(Video clip was played to the jury.)

THE WITNESS:  You're seeing the ground up tobacco here, which some of the tobacco used in cigarettes is ground up and they extract the color and nicotine out of the product to make it a product called reconstituted tobacco.  About a third of tobacco in most cigarettes today is man-made.  It's reconstituted tobacco.  Like making a piece of paper from wood pulp.  And that's done because you can use all aspects of the plant not just the leaves, the tobacco leaves themselves, but the stems and the stalks. They grind it up.  Cigarettes that sit on the shelf and are not sold come back to the plant, they reuse the tobacco.  They put it through the

1760 the liquid dropping down.

Q.    And what is that?

A.    That's the nicotine and color that they've extracted from the tobacco in the reconstitution process.  They call it the rich brown liquor.

Q.    If we could run it, please.

And what is that, Dr. Cummings?

A.    That is one of the � I believe the additive, a vat of the additives that they're putting in the product, DAP, diammonium phosphate.  So that's one of the ammonia compounds that are added to the reconstituted tobacco sheet.

And urea is another pH modifier that alters that pH level acid to basic that's used as an additive in making cigarettes.

This is the sheet of tobacco.  So this is what it look likes after it's been manufactured like a piece of paper coming off in these giant sheets.  And they would then take these and cut it up into strips in the tobacco.  If you actually take tobacco out of a rod and you drop it in a glass of water, the paper sheet, the man-made tobacco sinks to the bottom of the glass, the glass of water will turn from clear to brownish as some of the chemicals, including the nicotine as well as some of the coloring agents they spray back on the

THE WITNESS:  Now you can see it's just running down a conveyor belt that's all.  All automated.

You can see it, you know, this is now being mixed in with other tobacco, natural tobacco. So they blend in the tobacco.

And it's rolled up into giant bins there, rolls.  And then they take the mixed tobacco blend and put it into the high-speed cigarette making equipment.  You're making cigarettes at a rate of about 12,000 sticks per minute. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Thank you.

Dr. Cummings, one of the things that you said was as you talked about nicotine is extracted and then put back in.  Do you have an opinion as to when it is reapplied whether the cigarette companies control the amount of nicotine they put back in the cigarette?

A.    Yes.  It's part of the formula.  I mean, they take it out and you can leave it out, but they put it back in because it provides a way of giving precise dosing of the nicotine along with the blended.  So it's

1762 not just the recon.  Recon is just one of the elements. You have the man-made tobacco and then you have other natural components of the leaves that are used.  And that's also controlled.  Because cigarettes are highly genetically engineered in the farm.  So through cross hybridization and breeding you can control the level of nicotine that you'll get from a plant.  And there's also bioengineering where you can actually genetically alter plants in ways that you can grow tobacco without nicotine or very low levels of nicotine, or high.

THE COURT:  Couple of more questions, Mr. Bass, then we'll break for the evening.

MR. BASS:  Yes, Your Honor. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Do we have an internal RJ Reynolds company document from 1959 entitled "The optimum composition of tobacco and its smoke"?

A.    Yes, we did.  That's Alan Rodgman from RJ Reynolds and Ken Hoover, who is the director of research and development of Reynolds at that time.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd ask to publish PT 2141.

MR. BELASIC:  No objection.

THE COURT:  Admitted.

Q.    And who is Mr. Hoover?

A.    He's the director of research at Reynolds.

He started there in 1954.

Q.    Let's see what Rodgman writes.  "The physiological requirements of the smoker with respect to nicotine can be met by the application of the optimum amount of nicotine to the extracted tobacco." Did I read that right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Is that what you've been talking about, about removing it and then putting it back in in controlled amounts?

A.    That's right.  He's talking about the reconstituted or man-made tobacco.  So they take the nicotine out and then they can reapply it.  And he's describing what the optimum amount of nicotine that they need to have in their cigarettes at this time would be and that they can achieve it by reapplying the nicotine to precise dosing levels.

Q.    Is there a threshold level of nicotine in cigarettes that if it's too low it won't sustain addiction?

A.    Sure.  They were studying it carefully. They had a number of research programs which focused on the question of how low do you go.

DIRECT EXAMINATION, CONTINUING, BY MR. BASS:

Q.  Good morning, Dr. Cummings.  You heard the judge say we are almost finished with direct. So we'll wrap up by looking at some more internal company documents.  Okay?

A.  Okay.

Q.  We left off yesterday talking about the ability of the industry to, and the fact that they do, remove nicotine from cigarettes and then put it back in in controlled amounts, correct?

A.  1959.

Q.  1959.  Sorry.  Thank you.

Are there other internal company documents discussing controlling nicotine levels? A.  Many, hundreds.

Q.  Are you familiar with the September 18th, 1963, Brown & Williamson document from Griffiths to Kirwin? A.  Yes.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd offer PT1552 into evidence.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT1552 was received in evidence.)

MR. TELOFSKI:  I'm sorry. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  And what we're looking at, Dr. Cummings, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, September 18th, '63.

There's a recipient, Mr. Kirwin, right? A.  Correct.

Q.  And what does this document discuss?

A.  The importance of nicotine in the product and the ability of the cigarette companies to control, through a variety of methods, including genetic engineering of their product, precise dosing of nicotine and sugars in their products.

Q.  Let's look at what's written here. Nicotine is by far the most characteristic single constituent in tobacco and the known physiological effects are positively correlated with smoker response. Did I read that right?

A.  Yes.

Q. Go on to the next page, please. We'll show the chart. If you can tell the members of the jury what this chart is?

A.  Sure.  They're looking by quarters. This is in obviously the early 1960s, from 1960 to the early part of 1963, when this letter is written, and they're tracking the average nicotine levels in cigarettes at that time both for their own products of Brown & Williamson but also their competitors' products and they're correlating the nicotine levels with sales.

Q.  If we could go on to the next, and that's what written here in the next �

A.  He explains the chart and the correlation that they found with their cigarette sales.

Q.  Certainly our own sales pattern during this period has been positively correlated within the nicotine level of the tobacco in our products. Did I read that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now this is a 1963 document, right?

A.  Yeah, written by Dr. Griffiths who is the head of R&D at Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company to the head of British American Tobacco.

Q.  And was Mary Cooper smoking a Brown &

16 Williamson cigarette in 1963?

A.  Yes, Belair was produced by Brown &

18 Williamson

Q.  Let's see what else we have highlighted for the jury, please.

Certainly the nicotine level of B&W cigarettes given in the above table was not obtained by accident.

It may be well to remind you, however, that we have a research program in progress to

2 desired.

3           Did I read that right?

4      A.  You did.

5      Q.  And the last page to round out this

6 document:  I think that we can say even now that

7 we can regulate, fairly precisely, the nicotine

8 and sugar levels to almost any desired level

9 management might require.

10           Did I read that right?

11      A.  Yes.

12      Q.  And is that what they and others did?

13      A.  Yes, it is.

14      Q.  What is genetic engineering of nicotine

15 or genetic engineering of tobacco?

16      A.  Well, there's two methods.  One goes

17 back many decades which has to do with cross

18 breeding of different varieties of tobacco plants.

19 I mentioned the different types earlier, bright

20 tobacco and Turkish tobacco.  They differ quite a

21 bit in terms of the nicotine content.

22           They're cured differently, which is how

23 they age the product, and you can, with cross

24 breeding of the plants, in other words, just

25 crossing the plants, through what they call cross

hybridization, you can genetically engineer the plant to deliver higher or lower levels of nicotine, and that was done.  That was what they're talking about there in that letter.

And then more recently, really in the 19- � late 1980s, through the '90s and today, we � there are other ways to manipulate the genetics of a tobacco plant through the insertion of enzymes into the plant that will block the development of nicotine or enhance the development of nicotine.

And, in fact, there's genetic engineering going on to effect, not only nicotine levels, but how resistant a plant might be to pests and so on when it's growing in the field.

So it's a large area of research for all the companies.  So two types, cross hybridization, and then what is referred to as bioengineering of the plant where you're literally altering the plant DNA.

Q.  And have we brought along a video, a Philip Morris video demonstrating that process? A.  Yeah, this is a video from the

24 mid-1980s, and Philip Morris was involved in a

research program, which has continued actually

of nicotine.

Our objective is to prevent the synthesis of nicotine in the tobacco cells.

We prevent the formation of a required protein referred to as MPO necessary for catalyzing one of the major steps in the plant's synthesis of nicotine.

The steps are, we cut and sterilize a small piece of healthy plant, place the cutting on a culture medium containing nutrients, allowing cell multiplication forming cali.

We then biologically inject the cells with an anti-sense gene which produces RNA that is capable of interfering with the formation of the

15 MPO enzyme.

We place the cali on another medium for continued growth.  We sub-culture to allow for both shoot and root development.

The resulting plantlets are eventually transplanted into a greenhouse for further cultivation.

The fully grown plant will produce seed. These seeds will be used for both greenhouse and field trials to evaluate the continued expression of low nicotine traits in the plant.

Q.  And she started smoking Marlboro product
	

roughly in 1990, right?
	

A.  That's my understanding, yes.
	

Q.  Did Marlboro cigarettes cause damage to
	

Mary which sustained her addiction and helped
	

contribute to her cancer?
	

A.  Yes.

A.  Correct.  He's attaching a file which had the details of their research on pH and pH

because tobacco smoke is naturally slightly acidic, and if you bump up the pH to make it a little bit more basic, you create more free nicotine, which is more readily absorbed and gives you more nicotine kick or satisfaction.

Q.  And we had talked earlier � maybe it was yesterday, maybe it was Monday � about the use of code words in documents, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Is nicotine satisfaction, in your opinion, a code word for something?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And what's it a code word for?

A.  Addiction.  It's the impact of the drug physiologically on the smoker.

Q.  And in regards to altering smoke pH to impact nicotine satisfaction, do we have another document from Dr. Teague entitled "Implications and Activities Arising from Correlation of Smoke pH with Nicotine Impact, other Smoke Qualities, and Cigarette Sales"?

A.  Yes.  This is the attached material.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd offer PT3291 into evidence.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT3291 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Again, RJR Secret, and the title, as I just read it, and let's see what Dr. Teague has written at various points.

And so tell us, what is this document, in essence?  What's it looking at?

A.  They're comparing the pH levels of their cigarettes, that is, RJ Reynolds cigarettes, with their competitors, particularly Marlboro and Kool, both of which had increased in sales in the mid '60s through the early '70s.  This is a document from the early '70s.

And they're trying to understand what's related to those sales, and pH level was one of the things that varied when they compared their products against like Marlboro, which had started to use ammonia as an additive to the reconstituted tobacco which affected pH, slightly bumping up the pH of the product.

And so they're noting here, all evidence indicates that relatively high smoke pH (high

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

alkalinity) shown by Marlboro (and other Philip

controlled.

This has raised questions as to the effect of higher smoke pH on nicotine impact and smoke quality, hence market performance, and how the higher smoke pH might be accomplished.

Q. And as you indicated, this is a document of RJ Reynolds looking at two of its competitors' brands?

A.  Right.

Q.  One of those is Marlboro, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And did Mary Cooper smoke Marlboro cigarettes?

A.  Yes, she did.

Q.  It also references Kool as a product where the nicotine level is deliberate and controlled, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Did Mary Cooper smoke Kool cigarettes?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Let's go on to Page 6 of the document, please, Jeff, which talks about what Dr. Teague is suggesting RJ Reynolds do, right?

A.  Well, actually it's just describing the different methods for controlling pH.  I think I had mentioned there are a variety of methods yesterday for controlling pH.

And he describes seven different ways that pH can be manipulated in the design of a cigarette.

And the indicating methods which might be used to increase smoke pH and nicotine kick include, number one, increasing the amount of the burley in the blend, so changing the blend, reduction of casing sugars used in the burley blend, use of alkaline additives, usually ammonia compounds, to the blend.

There are other compounds that could be use.  Urea, I think I mentioned yesterday.

17 Addition of nicotine, so you just add more

nicotine to the blend.

Removal of acids from the blend, special filtering system to remove acids or other � or add alkaline material to the smoke, and then the use of filters with the air vents, air dilution, and they mentioned that methods 1 to 3 in combination represent the Philip Morris approach, and are under investigation at Reynolds.

Q.  We've seen documents from Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, Philip Morris.  Was Lorillard � strike that.

Have you seen documents from Lorillard on the topic that we're talking about, controlling nicotine or finding minimum nicotine levels?

A.  Yes.  Lorillard had a major research program on nicotine control, nicotine augmentation, that they talked about, so in the 1970s, actually into the 1980s, talking about different approaches for controlling the nicotine levels.

In other words, how to get nicotine delivered more efficiently to the smoker when they were lowering the amount of actual amount of tobacco that they were selling in the cigarette.

Q. And is one such document from Lorillard, February 13th, 1980, from Richard Smith to others including Dr. A. W. Spears?

A.  Yes, Dr. Spears was the director of research at Lorillard and he went on to run the company.

6      Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Again, another document

7 marked, Secret, dated, February 13, 1980, from

8 Richard Smith to the recipients, Spears, Flinn and

9 Ave.

10           Let's see what is written.

11           Goal, determine the minimum level of

12 nicotine that will allow continued smoking.  We

13 hypothesize that below some very low nicotine

14 level, diminished physiological satisfaction

15 cannot be compensated for by psychological

16 satisfaction.

17           At this point smokers will quit, or

18 return to higher T and N brands.

19           Did I read that right?

20      A.  Yeah, tar and nicotine.

21      Q.  And that highlights the discussion we

22 had earlier about, if it goes too low, people are

23 going to stop smoking, right?

24           MR. BELASIC:  Objection.  Leading.

25           THE COURT:  Sustained.

Rephrase.

Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  What will happen if nicotine levels go too low in cigarettes?

A.  The business records of the defendants in this case show that if you go below a threshold level of nicotine, people will be able to stop smoking and stay away from cigarettes, and if they keep it above that level, they make it hard to quit.

Q.  What would have happened to Mary Cooper's smoking if nicotine levels would have gone too low?

A.  Well, she was trying to quit in the 1980s.  I think she would have been able to stay off cigarettes if the nicotine levels had been reduced to a nonaddictive level, and as most smokers have tried to quit and would stay off if they could.

So my opinion is she would have quit and would have been able to stay off, as millions of other smokers would have done as well.

Q.  And would she have avoided her disease if that happened?

A.  I believe, yes, she would have avoided her disease had they made it possible for her to

quit and freely stay off their cigarettes rather than engineering it to keep her hooked.

Q.  Now Mary Cooper smoked Newport cigarettes, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And who manufactured Newport?

A.  Lorillard.

Q.  Did Lorillard cigarettes substantially contribute to Mary Cooper's addiction and her laryngeal cancer?

MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  Calls for a

expertise.

THE COURT:  Well, as I said before, everybody in the courtroom knows he's not giving

16 medical opinions because he's not a doctor.

Let me review the question. THE WITNESS:  The answer is yes. THE COURT:  The question is about addiction so he can answer the question.  It's overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  Now this is a document from Lorillard in 1980, right? A.  Yes.

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now we're talking about, as we've talked a lot about nicotine levels being too low to sustain smoking and thus allowing people to quit, and on that topic, what is the Nordine � are you familiar with the Nordine study, Dr. Cummings?

A.  Sure.  Richard Nordine.  He was in the

a massive study in the early '80s, on the factors affecting the cigarette market, and this was shared with the vice president of R&D, Dr. DiMarco, and I believe Dr. Teague wrote a memo commenting on the findings and implications of the Nordine study.

Q.  Is this document � well, let's see what's written in the document.

MR. BASS:  At this time, Your Honor, we'd offer PT1820 into evidence.

Most of those who have smoked for any significant time would like to stop.

Many, but not most of those who would like to stop smoking are able to do so. Did I read that right?

A.  Correct.  Those were the findings from their study.

Q.  Was Mary Cooper one of those smokers that struggled to quit smoking?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Let's go on to the next page, please.

With sufficient knowledge/information, we should be able to maintain/increase the size of the total market by influencing entry and exit rates.

Did I read that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  However, we cannot ever be comfortable selling a product which most of our customers would stop using if they could.  That is to say, if the exit gate from our market should suddenly open, we could be out of business almost overnight, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And they did not want that to happen,

did they?

A.  No, in fact, they go on to talk about the implication of the fact that most people want to quit but can't, but if that were to ever happen, they talk about smoking cessation therapies which were not very good at that time � this is the early '80s.

They said some time maybe they will have a method that will help people quit, and they said at that point smokers would leave them.

And he said then they have three options, go out of business, find a way to hold smokers in the market, or come up with alternative products that would appeal to smokers.

They said option one, going out of business, was not an option.  Number two was finding a way to eliminate the desire of smokers to stop smoking, and number three was to look at alternative products.

And then it goes on to the summary on the last page.

I'll just read the whole paragraph.

Clearly, we will remain in the conventional cigarette business as long as we can, but I believe, in view of the Nordine study and

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

other information, we need to begin to very seriously think about where we go when and if the

3 market disappears.

4           There are some long-term, high risk cost

5 things that we need to address because to repeat,

6 we cannot be comfortable marketing a product which

7 most of our customers would do without if they

8 could.

9      Q.  Dr. Cummings, did Mary Cooper eventually

10 smoke Marlboro Lights?

11      A.  Yes.

12      Q.  And have we brought along a video that

13 demonstrates the history of Marlboro advertising

14 through Marlboro up through Marlboro Lights?

15      A.  Yes.

16      Q.  Okay.  And does this video show how ads

17 correlate to sales of cigarettes?

18      A.  Yes.  It's a 1990, sort of internal

19 review of the success of the Marlboro brand, which

20 had become the best selling cigarette in the

21 world, and they describe why that came about, you

22 know, and associate it with their advertising and

23 marketing including the modification of the

product.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT4579C was received in evidence.)

(Video clip played as follows:)

VOICE:  Marlboro Country, it's a special place, where some men do what others only dream about, and life has a flavor all its own.

VOICE:  Let's go back in time and take a look at how the Marlboro story developed.  Back in the 1950s, Marlboro was advertised to female smokers.

The cigarette itself was (inaudible). The package was white and feminine, and the copy read:  You need never feel oversmoked.  That's the

16 miracle of Marlboro.

But in 1954, the Philip Morris Company saw an opportunity to make major revisions in

19 Marlboro and its image.

Times were changing and the filter cigarettes were becoming popular.  Marlboro was reformulated to make it stronger, more flavorful, and more appealing to male smokers.

To launch the new Marlboro, a revolutionary new package was designed, the now

5 Marlboro red roof.  Over the years, the red roof

famous flip-top box.  The flip-top box was bold, eye catching, masculine.

It carried a distinctive design in red and white, which has come to be known as the

has proved to be an outstanding logo, and it is now the most famous symbol in the history of advertising.

The move in 1954, by Philip Morris to reposition Marlboro was bold and innovative.  This decision combined with many others along the way has made Marlboro the greatest success in tobacco history.

In 1962, the Marlboro man had become strictly a cowboy.  He now had a clear-cut, unmistakable identity, and he had a home, Marlboro Country.

He was his own man in a world he owned, and television and print combined to romance his rugged masculinity and the beauty of Marlboro Country.

Television advertising of cigarettes ended in the U.S. in 1971, but Marlboro made a smooth transition to print and outdoor advertising.

This successful transition was largely due to the death of the Marlboro Country idea. There's an endless variety in Marlboro pictures. The life of the cowboy and the American west remains a never ending story, continually improving, always presenting the look of a leader.

Over the years, Marlboro smokers have recognized the quality of Marlboro and its leadership position resulting in continued growth.

In 1955, Marlboro sales in the United States were a modest 6 billion.  However, within only one year, volume nearly tripled, and Marlboro sales to smokers took off domestically.

Throughout the 1960s, Marlboro sales to smokers gained even more momentum both domestically and around the world.

In fact, total volume for Marlboro sales to smokers more than doubled during this decade.

As a result, combined sales reached 105 billion in 1972, making Marlboro the best selling cigarette in the world, and it has remained the leader ever since.

Marlboro is far and away the leader in the cigarette industry, and the trend is continually upward.

1           In 1990, Marlboro sold more than 344

2 billion cigarettes worldwide.

3           In fact, today either through Philip

4 iMorris, affiliated companies or by direct export,

5 Harlboro is marketed in more than 150 nations and

6 territories, making it the most widely distributed

7 consumer packaged goods product in the world. Superior marketing has played a big role

9 in the success of Marlboro as well, as symbolized

10 by the famous Marlboro red roof which has become

11 the most outstanding design in advertising

12 history

13           As early as 1954, Philip Morris's

14 [management recognized the potential of marketing a

filter cigarette.  In much the same manner, line extensions such as Marlboro Lights have taken advantage of changing tastes and attitudes of smokers to build the brand.

Marlboro was among the first to introduce a lights line extension, and this kind of aggressive marketing has paid off, as Marlboro Lights has grown to become a significant part of the Marlboro business.

Here are six criteria for understanding

25 Marlboro advertising and the Marlboro man.  First

11

12

1801

and foremost, the cowboy is the hero, in charge of his life and the world around him.

Second, he is believable.  Every detail of the picture is authentic.

Third, every picture is candid.

and not be staged.

Fourth, every picture must have impact. Each one must maintain the highest level of graphic execution without using visual gimmicks or tricks.

Fifth, there is an endless variety among

13 |Marlboro pictures in both subject matter and the

14 handling of layouts.  Each new ad strives to be

15 fresh and original, an unexpected combination of

16 familiar elements

17           After all these years, there is still

18 far more to Marlboro Country than has yet been

19 seen in the advertising.

20           Finally, the beauty and magnificence of

21 iMarlboro Country must reveal its grandeur.

22 |Marlboro Country is never ordinary

23           The same strength and commitment to

24 excellence extends to outdoor point-of-sale and

25 throughout the entire range of Marlboro

advertising and promotional material.

Each piece is carefully designed to keep the Marlboro trademark strong.  This can be seen in promotions such as these which use the famous

In addition, Marlboro sponsors motor sports and other sporting events around the world.

All promotions must be of the highest quality.  They must be consistent with the look of a leader and reflect the worldwide leadership of the Marlboro trademark.

This then is the Marlboro story.  How an idea was created and developed and extended into one of the most successful marketing concepts in the world.

It's a marketing classic that illustrates the power of innovation, taking a good idea and continually making it better.

It's a timeless story of heroic men and the world of freedom, and like the land that stretches out to endless horizons, there will always be a Marlboro Country.

your testimony, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Now when Surgeon General's reports were issued, did the industry attack the Surgeon General?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And what are some examples of some things that they would say when the Surgeon General would issue his or her report to try and inform the public?

A.  Basically what would happen is anytime that a Surgeon General's report would come out, and there are many examples of this, they would usually have a press note that would come out in advance.

I think in 1972, the Surgeon General at the time issued their report, and there was a press notice that said:  In response to the Surgeon General saying cigarettes are the number one cause of premature death in society.

Tobacco companies came back and said: Cigarettes aren't the number one problem.  It's the propaganda coming from the Surgeon General's office that's the number one problem.

So those kinds of things went on.

In 1988, when they issued the addiction report, there was a press release that was � came out, again, attacking the findings of the report, which is that cigarettes are addictive, that nicotine was the drug that caused the addiction, and that the pharmacologic and behavioral processes that cause nicotine addiction are similar to those that you see for other drugs of abuse such as cocaine and heroin.

Q.  And as you indicated, a press release was issued by the industry after the 1988 Surgeon General's report, right?

A.  Right.  That report came out in May. There was a press release that was issued, and, you know, right on the day of the report, and then, you know, this is from the Tobacco Institute, and those folks would show up on television shows and so on countering the evidence.

So there was a controversy about whether cigarettes were addictive, because the companies denied that they were addictive.

Q.  And is that PT2510B?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Speaking on behalf of all the defendants in this courtroom?

A.  Correct.

Q. Let's see what some of the things are written.

This report, talking about the 1988 report, trivializes the serious drug problem faced by society.  The claim that cigarette smoking is a drug addiction similar to cocaine or heroin use, or alcohol abuse, is unfortunate and unwarranted.

The message to the American public is that using illegal drugs, such as crack or heroin, has the same risk of addiction as smoking. Did I read that right?

A.  Yes.

Q. The claims that smokers are "addicts" defy common sense and contradict the fact that people quit smoking every day.

Did I read that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Have you studied and researched and do you have an opinion on the impact of this type of statement regarding the addictiveness of nicotine on addicted smokers like Mary Cooper?

A.  Yes, I have.

1807

Q.  And what is your opinion in that regard?

A.  Well, these kinds of statements and the statements that follow from the companies belittled addiction, and, basically, made people who were addicted smokers struggling to quit feel like failures, that they somehow didn't have the willpower, not really understanding that this was a physiological addiction.

And, unfortunately, that kind of debate, creating a false controversy over what the science really was, delayed efforts, you know, for people to get help, to quit smoking, to develop real treatments that will help people stop smoking. So, yeah, it had an effect.

Q.  Besides having an effect on addicted smokers like Mary Cooper, it wasn't true, right.

I mean did the cigarette companies know well before 1988, that nicotine in cigarettes were addictive?

A.  Absolutely.  I mean you can find studies going back into, well, 1959, British American Tobacco, and their affiliated company, Brown &

23 Williamson, were funding studies on nicotine

addiction.

They called cigarettes, based on those

studies:  We're in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug.

They knew before even the Surgeon General's general came out in 1964, that their products were addictive and they used that information to control the nicotine, to make it hard for people to stop, and they did that.  That was their choice.

MR. BELASIC:  Objection, Your Honor. This is way beyond the question.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr. Bass, we have covered this extensively now for 14 hours.  So

13 move to a new topic, please.

MR. BASS:  Yes, si. Q.  (By MR. BASS)  And for the record, the document you're talking about, PT3615, right? A.  Correct.

MR. BASS:  And, Your Honor, at this time we'd offer PT3615 into evidence.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT3615 was received in evidence.)

cigarettes, designing them for addiction.

Is there any evidence that Mary Cooper knew about the fact that these companies were seeking the minimum amount of nicotine to keep smokers smoking?

A.  No.

Q.  Is there any evidence that she knew about genetic engineering of tobacco, for example?

A.  No.

Q.  Is there any evidence that she knew about additives and chemicals in cigarettes?

A.  No.  I asked her questions in my interview about what she knew, and she didn't know anything about some of the things that we've talked about.

Q.  Is there any evidence that she knew about smoke pH and the ability of the companies to

19 manipulate that?

A.  No.

Q.  What are the Waxman hearings, Dr. Cummings?

A.  Those were congressional hearings in 1994, and there was discussion at that time about, I think from the FDA Commissioner about regulating

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

1810

cigarettes, and so the cigarette companies were asked to come in and give testimony before a congressional hearing, and that was the Waxman, Congressman Waxman's committee, which they did in

5 April of 1994.

6      Q.  I think we have two clips from the

VOICE:  Mr. Campbell, you were also deposed, and you said, quote:  To my knowledge, it has not been proven that cigarette smoking causes cancer.

This is a rather passive and puzzling approach, especially in light of the consensus, not by some, but all of the scientific community.

Will you ever be convinced, and what evidence are you waiting for.

of � he was the editor of one of their publications that they put out sort of tracking scientific issues that were going on related to smoking health.

And he's writing to his boss, Bill Kloepfer, who is the vice president in charge of public affairs for the Tobacco Institute, and they're commenting on some statements that had appeared in the press from the director of NIDA, the National Institutes on Drug Abuse, in 1980, talking about cigarettes and addiction and the implications of that.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, I believe this objection has already been overruled.

MR. DAVIS:  I apologize.  I thought there had been a ruling otherwise.

THE COURT:  No problem, sir. Q.  (BY MR. BASS)  What's written here is: I feel badly about my own lack of

intelligence-gathering in this situation.  But I don't think the questions I now raise are academic.

The lawyers remind us, I'm told, that the entire matter of addiction is the most potent weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung cancer/cigarette case.

We can't defend continued smoking as "free choice" if the person was "addicted."

Did I read that right? A.  Yes.

Who is going to go first?

MR. BELASIC:  We're going to have to move some things around, Your Honor, take a few minutes.

MR. BELASIC:  Yeah, because I think we need to move the podium.

A.  One of the leading, yeah, health organizations in the country.

Q.  And they have experts on addiction and the health effects of smoking at their organization, right?

A.  Well, primarily on the health effects. They're cancer doctors for the most part.  They don't have experts in addiction which is why I think they came to me.

Q.  So you submitted it to them and they approved it for publication, correct?

This is admissible.  It's overruled. (Defendants' Exhibit AN133 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  Can we put up the first page?  So, Dr. Cummings, can you see? A.  I can't. Q.  Okay.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr. Belasic, hang on one second.  Let me just make sure we get the procedure right here.  Are you going to move other documents in through him?

MR. BELASIC:  I will.

THE COURT:  Have they got numbers on them?

MR. BELASIC:  They do. THE COURT:  Okay.  Make sure we keep track of them.

MR. BELASIC:  And we'll give them to your clerk at the end of the day.

THE COURT:  All right.  Go ahead. Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  So that's Smart Move and that's the brochure you wrote, right, the American Cancer Society? A.  Yes, it is. Q.  And it provides guidance for people who

want to
	quit smoking?
	

A.
	Yes.  It's a self-help guide.
	

Q.
	And you've used it in your stop smoking
	

programs
	when you were running them in New York,
	

correct?
	
	

A.
	I did.
	

Q.
	And you believe the information in there
	

is truthful and accurate, correct?
		

A.
	At the time it was written in '87,
	

yeah.
	
	

Q.
	And you've said, for example, as early
	

as this
	year, you still believe the information in
	

there is
	truthful and accurate, correct?
	

A.
	At the time of '87, that's true.
	

Q.
	All right.  Because I just asked you a
	

couple months ago the same question and you said
		

yes, right?
		

A.
	Yeah.
	

Q.
	All right.  Now in your Smart Move
	

pamphlet
	s you have testimonials of the actual
	

patients
	or the actual smokers that you saw from
	

your clinic, correct?
		

A.
	True.
	

Q.
	And the reason you put those
	

testimonials in with the people's faces is to give

guidance for other people who want to quit?

A.  With the quotes, designed to motivate people.

Q.  Okay.  So, for example, on the third page, you put the testimony of a woman named Yvette Jay, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And that was Yvette J., and she says � if people can see it:  I always thought it would be impossible to stop.  Anyone can do it if they set their mind to it.  A positive attitude is important.

And you selected that quote, correct?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And it says former one-and-a-half-pack-a-day smoker, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And that's the same level that

19 Ms. Cooper smoked for most of her life except at

the end, fair?

A.  Fair.

Q.  All right.  Now in your brochure you also provide smokers with a checklist that tells them if they have what it takes to stop smoking, correct?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=618
1826

1      A.  Well, it's a readiness, to see if

2 they're ready to make a quit attempt.

3      Q.  Okay.  Let's put up the checklist.  All

4 right.

5           Now the first question � well, let's

6 just read the whole thing.  It says:  Getting

7 ready.  You asked these people:  Do you have what

8 it takes to stop smoking?  It says:  There is no

9 magic cure that can help you stop.  Take this

10 short quiz to find out if you have what it takes.

11 Right?

12      A.  Yes.

13      Q.  And the first question that the smoker

14 has to answer or should answer is:  Do you want to

15 stop smoking, right?

16      A.  Correct.

17      Q.  And that's pretty obvious.  Smokers need

18 to be motivated to quit smoking, correct?

19      A.  Sure.

20      Q.  If a person doesn't really want to quit

21 smoking, they're unlikely to quit?

22      A.  True.

23      Q.  So there are some ways that you can

24 gauge whether a smoker is motivated to quit or

25 not, right?

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=619
5 motivation to quit by whether they throw their

6 7 8 9 10 11

12 Are you willing to make some changes in your daily

13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1827

A.  This is a readiness test to assess that, these three questions.

Q.  For example, sometimes you've said you can gauge a smoker's or measure a smoker's

cigarettes away?

A.  That's one way.

Q.  And we knew Ms. Cooper never threw her cigarettes away until 2001, when she stopped?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Now the second question, and it says:

routine?     And that's important to a smoker, correct?

A.     Sure.

Q.      If they want to quit?

A.     That's part of the assessment of their readiness to make changes.  So it's a readiness test to see if they're ready to make a quit attempt.

Q.     And the word you use is, are they

willing.     They have to be willing to make some

changes,   right?

A.     Yes.

Q.     Now the third question, let's go to the

third question, you again use the word "willing,"
	

right?
	

A.  Correct.
	

Q.  And you say:  Are you willing to put up
	

with some uneasy moments after stopping, right?
	

A.  That's right.
	

Q.  And they have to be willing to do that
	

to quit, correct?
	

A.  Well, we're basically previewing what's
	

in the guide which is explaining that you may
	

actually feel withdrawal when you quit.
	

Q.  Okay.
	

A.  Because a lot of people don't always
	

know that.
	

Q.  And when you wrote this, you had been
	

seeing, counseling, talking to, interviewing many,
	

many smokers, right?
	

A.  True.
	

Q.  Over a period of many, many years?
	

A.  That's right.
	

Q.  And so these three questions were based
	

on your real life experience with real live human
	

beings who smoked, right?
	

A.  Yes.
	

Q.  Okay.  Now at the bottom, you say:  If

you can answer yes to all three questions, you can stop smoking. That's what you put in the American Cancer Society smoking guide, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Let's go to Page � well, first of all, you can't quit without making an effort to quit, correct, unless you're put in prison or locked on some island without cigarettes, right?

A.  True.

Q.  You have to make a serious effort to quit, to quit?

A.  You have to make an effort to quit, yeah.

Q.  Okay.  Let's go to Page 9.

And here you tell people some of the good things that will happen to them if they quit, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And you say:  Have you ever said, why bother stopping, the damage is already done?  And you say, that's wrong.

You have heard smokers tell you that, right?

A.  Sure.  I work at a Cancer Center.  I see people who continue to smoke after diagnosis of

cancer.

Q.  Right, too late to quit?

A.  And they often will say that, but that's not true.

Q.  Okay.  And so you say:  Your body begins to repair itself as soon as you stop smoking. That's true, right?

A.  It does.  Every cigarette you smoke does your body damage.  So every one you forgo, you don't do that damage.

Q.  And you say:  Within a few days, mucus in your airways breaks up, clears out of your lungs.  Within a few weeks, your circulation improves.  You'll be able to smell and taste more.

And then you say:  Within a year, your risk of lung cancer begins to decrease, correct?

A.  Yeah, compared to somebody who continues to smoke.

Q.  And if you stop smoking, your risk of larynx cancer will begin to decrease, correct?

A.  True.

Q.  And those are the diseases that

23 Ms. Cooper developed?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now you'd never tell a smoker:  Sir or

A.  That's true.  I mean obviously I'm there to try to support efforts for people to stop smoking.  So I'm not going to say there's no way that you can quit.

Although in my experience I've seen many people smoke themselves right into the grave, unable to quit even though they struggled to try.

MR. BELASIC:  The question was, Your Honor, did he ever tell �

THE COURT:  Sustained.

Dr. Cummings, again, this is cross.  The rules are a little bit different as you know.  So try to focus on the question and answer as succinctly as you can.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Can we go back to the chart on the three questions about can you quit. Now, again, just if you can answer yes to those three questions, you can stop smoking, that's what was put in the American Cancer Society stop smoking guide that you wrote?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Okay.  So this is republished in '97.

A.  I did, twice.

Q.  And by the 1990s, you said that you had started obtaining many, many pages of documents, the tobacco company internal documents that you've been talking about for the last two days?

A.  The late '90s, actually.

Q.  So in the late 1990s, you were starting to review what Mr. Bass says are these secret, confidential documents that people outside the industry had not seen, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you talked about some of them at the Engle trial?

A.  Gee, I don't know whether I did or not at the Engle trial.  I talked about some documents from the companies.

Q.  Okay.

A.  I know a letter from Philip Morris attorneys to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

MR. BELASIC:  It has nothing to do with this case.

THE WITNESS:  I'm just recalling that one .

THE COURT:  It's not responsive to the question.  Disregard the last part of the answer.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So in the late '90s, you are reviewing as part of your work, your professional work these internal company documents some which Mr. Bass has shown us?

A.  Right.

Q.  And throughout the 2000s, year after year after year, part of your work was to review those documents, right?

A.  Yes, I got grants to do that.

Q.  And so you got money � and that's taxpayer money from the federal government to look at those documents, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So you're doing that partially for a living, taxpayer dollars, year after year, you're looking at these documents, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And then around 2009, right, more than ten years later, these lawsuits start, these Engle lawsuits start, correct, these individual smoker suits?

A.  Well, there were individuals as part of the original class in Engle, which had started in the mid '90s, before any of the documents, and I was involved in that.

Q.  And you told the jurors, you've testified at about 80 trials, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Most of them have been these individual lawsuits from Engle, correct?

A.  Most of them but not all.

Q.  And you started testifying in these Engle lawsuits in 2009, right?

A.  Well, the first one I did was in '98, I believe, the original Engle case, the Engle progeny cases as they're referred to, yeah, they didn't start until 2009.

Q.  And that's my question.  So after more than ten years of looking at documents, when the individual smokers started coming in with their lawsuits, you started testifying, and that was

around 2009?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And after all those years of looking at the documents, in 2009 and forward, your position was that everybody can quit smoking; isn't that true?

A.  I don't understand the context of your � no, that's not true.  As I just told the jury, it's been my experience in working with many smokers that they smoke themselves into the grave.

There are people that can quit smoking, but there are people that I've worked with who have never been able to quit.

Q.  Your position when you started this litigation, you started testifying in 2009, in these cases, was that if the smoker is motivated, their success rate is 100 percent in quitting; isn't that true?

A.  No, that's not true.  What I had said � I think you're taking it out of context, a statement that I've made.  I tell smokers: Everybody can make a quit attempt.

That's why they're a readiness test, if you've ready to make a quit attempt, but I also explain to smokers the reality of how difficult it

will be and, in fact, even in our guide that I wrote in 1987, we talk about, you know, picking yourself up after a slip and that relapse is part of the process, because it is, because only about five out of 100 people are successful in quitting if they do it on their own.

Q.  You testified in January 2009, in a deposition to be used for many different Engle lawsuits, correct, sometimes it's called your generic videotaped deposition testimony?

THE COURT:  Listen to what the next question is first, Mr. Bass.

What's the next question, please?

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  When smokers come to your stop-smoking clinic, when they come to your stop-smoking clinic, 2009, you tell them:  The success rate for quitting for people who really want to quit and stick to it is 100 percent, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  All right.  And you've �

A.  And then I explain that most are going to relapse.  Of course I'm telling them in a joke. Everybody can be successful in quitting, and that's what I was telling people in our program, but the reality � and we talk about the reality is most people will fail and why they should pick themselves back up.

I just don't tell people:  You can quit easily.  That is not what I say.  That would be a

23 misstatement of my opinions and I think you know

that.

Q.  All right.  No, I think you know what

Mr. Gdanski, don't stand up.  You can't make
	

objections.  Mr. Bass is the person who can only
	

make objections.
	

MR. GDANSKI:  Understood.
	

THE COURT:  Number one.
	

Number two, let's get the rules
	

straight, Dr. Cummings.  Again, this is at least
	

the third or fourth trial.  Cross-examination is
	

different.  You cannot go on and explain your
	

answer when it's a simple yes or no question,
	

okay?
	

THE WITNESS:  Okay.
	

THE COURT:  You cannot just say
	

spontaneously anything you want to say after a
	

direct question such as:  Did you say this?  Okay?

Do you understand?

THE WITNESS:  Understood.

THE COURT:  Okay.  You have to stick to the question.  You've been through this before. You know that cross-examination is different.

to clarify, explain, extrapolate as they choose on redirect if they wish.  So we need to get through this as succinctly as we can.  You can't explain every answer unless it calls for an explanation.

Number two, what are you trying to do?

MR. BELASIC:  I just asked him is that his testimony.  He said:  I personally, in front of the jury, he said that:  I personally know I'm taking him out of context and it was a joke.  I'm sorry, but it upset me what he did.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Keep your voice down.

MR. BELASIC:  So here's what we want to play.

THE COURT:  You are just going to play a part of the video?

MR. BELASIC:  Yeah.  Let the jury assess his credibility and see if what he just told me was true.  That's impeachment.

MR. BASS:  And that's what was done with

But they're entitled to do their cross, and you are entitled to do your cross as you-all both see fit.  As long as it's within the rules, I'm going to make sure everybody plays by the rules.

That's my only role here, okay?

MR. BASS:  Yes, Your Honor.  They're saying, playing it.  Are they actually playing a video of it, or are they just showing the transcript?

smoking, right?

A.  True.

Q.  And those were 30 million people who were smoking during that time.  There was advertising during that time, correct?

A.  I think it's the cumulative number of people who were classified as former smokers.

Q.  And when those 30 million people quit between '64 and '79, there was a lot of cigarette advertising, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  You showed the jury all those examples, right?

A.  There was a ton of them.

Q.  And between 1964 and 1979, the tobacco companies publicly stated some of their opinions, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And the public was exposed to that as well?

A.  They were.

Q.  And the public saw the news and information from the Surgeon General when the '64 report came out, right?

A.  Not everybody certainly.

A.  Right.

Q.  And so during that period, from '64, and Ms. Cooper was smoking then, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Until 1979, when Ms. Cooper would have been about 28, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  The Surgeon General says 30 million people quit smoking, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And the Surgeon General said that that was the highest rate of quitting smoking for any period in the history of the country?

A.  That's true.

Q. All right. And 30 million people, that's actually more than the population of Florida, right?

A.  Yes.

them quit without any professional assistance, right?

A.  That is true.

Q.  And so those 30 million people, obviously they all quit without nicotine gum because it wasn't around, right?

A.  It wasn't around at that time, that's true.

Q.  And those 30 million people who quit in the '60s and '70s, they quit without nicotine patches?

A.  True.

Q.  And almost every one of them quit without some sort of medical intervention or a doctor's professional help; is that fair?

A.  That's fair.

Q.  Now based on your � let's talk briefly about what you reviewed.  You said you reviewed the sworn testimony of Ms. Cooper, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And she testified for portions of three days, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  So there's a lot of testimony from

examinat
	ion under oath of Ms. Cooper's smoking
	

history?
	
	

A.

received

Q.

that?
	
	

A.
	Because it wasn't intended to be a

for the

case.
	
	

Q.
	Okay.  So when it comes to what was �
	

did Ms.
	Cooper � did you interview her after she
	

gave her

A.
	Yes.

Q.  Okay.  So the only way we have of knowing what Ms. Cooper told you is to ask you or to ask Ms. Cooper or to look at your notes, right?

A.  True.  I spent nine hours in deposition being asked about it.

Q.  Okay.  And then Ms. Cooper was examined by a psychiatrist for the defendants, correct?

A.  I think before that.

Q.  All right.  And there is a transcript of that, correct?

A.  Yes, and I reviewed it.

Q.  So unlike your telephone interview, if we want to know what she told the psychiatrist, we can read it because there's a transcript?

A.  Sure.

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Overruled.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So you looked also at, what, all her medical records?  It's not a trick question.  You tell us.  What medical records did you look at?

A.  I had a set of records that were sent to

23 me by plaintiff's attorneys that dealt with

smoking.  So I don't think I looked at every

25 medical record.

A.  I can't say all, but I reviewed a number of � from her daughter and grandchildren and former husband and several of her doctors, five of her doctors.

Q.  And in your notes, you listed the depositions that you reviewed, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Just to be fair, I'm not going to claim you didn't review all.  It looks to me like you reviewed all.  So you looked at all those depositions.  You did the interview.  You read the transcript, and you reached various conclusions about Ms. Cooper, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  So let's go back.  From '64 to '79, 30 million people quit smoking without patches, without gum, without professional medical intervention, right?

A.  Most.  I mean there still were clinics at that point and there were some methods that were out there, but most people quit cold

Q.  Did not try to quit?

Q.  And the Surgeon General and other professional groups using some of that Center for Disease Control data that you've talked about, have estimated that there are 60 million people who used to smoke in the country, correct?

A.  That's true.

Q.  And it's not just the statistics, you, yourself, have said multiple times that 60 million people have quit smoking?

A.  I have.

Q.  And let's talk about those 60 million.

A.  Okay.

Q.  Even today with patches and gum, most � well, the great majority of those 60 million people who quit, they quit cold turkey?

A.  Most, yes.

Q.  Most.  Okay.  And so most of the 60

18 million people who quit didn't do it with patches,

gum, or other professional help?

A. That's true. More have done it with the help than in the past, but that is true.

Q. And of those 60 million people who quit, the majority, in your view, were addicted smokers who quit?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So you have tens of millions of people in this country who were addicted to smoking, but, nonetheless, chose to quit and succeeded?

A.  True.

Q.  And tens of millions of those smokers were heavy smokers, more than a pack a day?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And of the � I think you told us is it 90 percent, 90 percent of smokers start before they're 18?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Okay.  So of the 60 million people alive today who have quit smoking, what, more than 50

14 million of them started as youth, as minors?

A.  True.

Q.  Okay.  And millions of people who started even younger have gone on to quit smoking?

A.  Sure.  It's harder to quit when you start earlier.

Q.  But millions of people who have started at 12, 13, 14 have quit smoking?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And millions of people who started smoking at those early ages quit during a period before patches and gum were even around?

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Asked and answered.  Repetitive.

MR. BELASIC:  I'm moving on to a new category.

THE COURT:  Overruled.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So of those 30 million who quit in the '60s and '70s, most of those people would have started in the 1950s or the 1940s or even farther back, right?

A.  That is true.

Q.  And of those 30 million people who quit in the '60s and '70s, many of them started when they were young, in the '40s and '50s?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Many of them started before Ms. Cooper was even born?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now of the 60 million people who have quit smoking successfully in America, they've seen advertising, right?

Q.  You've got 60 million people.  They're smoking a cigarette.  They have a brain in their head, right, and the 60 million people who quit smoking, they, what, every one of them smoked cigarettes that had nicotine in them?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So 60 million people were smoking, who quit, were smoking cigarettes that had nicotine that had whatever effect it does on the brain, right?

A.  That's right, uh-huh.

Q.  So you talked about dopamine, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And dopamine is � it's a natural pleasure chemical that exists in all our brains, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And the body or our bodies trigger dopamine in response to certain stimuli, right?

A.  Yes, it does.

Q.  And you said one of the things that can trigger dopamine is nicotine?

A.  That's right.

Q.  One of the things that can trigger dopamine is caffeine?

that when he left.

Q.  It went down by 50 percent, I believe.

So of the 60 million people alive today who successfully quit smoking, every single one of them had an increase in dopamine when they smoked?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And they still quit?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And you told us about a chemical called serotonin, right, and that can regulate mood, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And that, again, it's natural.  It's in every one of our brains, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And it's a neurotransmitter, right?

A.  It's a neurotransmitter, yes.

Q.  Because the brain is a series of nerve endings and neurotransmitters, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  And there are hundreds of thousands of different neurotransmitters in every person's brain, right?

A.  You're talking about neurons, not neurotransmitters.

A.  Well, there are neurotransmitters which are these chemicals that communicate between the neurons, and they're stimulated by various things.

Q.  All right.  And just to clarify, you agree these neurotransmitters, they're in everybody's brains, not just smokers?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Okay.  So let's � same questions for serotonin.  The 60 million people who quit smoking cigarettes with nicotine, they had an increase, an effect on serotonin when they smoked, right?

A.  Yeah, abnormal because of the effects of the drug, yeah.

Q.  Okay.  And let's use your word.  Sixty

19 million people smoked, and you say it had an

abnormal effect on serotonin, but they successfully quit?

A.  Right.

Q.  And you told the jury about a concept called imprinting?

A.  Right.

Q.  And you said imprinting can create � it's sort of a brain or neural memory, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  And imprinting has something to do with what you described as conditioned response, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And a whole variety of repetitive behaviors will create imprinting in the brain, correct?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Like some of us haven't ridden a bicycle for a long time, but if we got on a bike, we would remember how to balance and pedal, right?

A.  Well, you'd hope so if you were on the bike.

Q.  And if you're someone like me who played baseball, you might not have thrown a baseball for a long time, but you still know how to snap off a curve because of muscle memory, right?

A.  Sure.

of smoking, you also brought up that there were various triggers and cues, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And so, in that sense, it's the habitual, repetitive intake of smoking that can cause � that can imprint memories on smokers?

A.  No.  I mean part of it is yes, but part of that is no, and imprinting in a drug addiction is drug reinforced.  So that's the difference between an addiction to a drug and a habit.

Q.  And those 60 million people today who have successfully quit smoking, they had smoking cause the imprint on their brains?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And the imprinting on their brains from years of smoking did not stop them from quitting, right?

A.  True.

Q.  And taken together, all of the impacts on the brain that you said could come from nicotine, those brain effects did not prevent the 60 million people from quitting, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Now obviously those 60 million people smoked all different kinds of brands, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And a lot of those 60 million people who quit smoked Marlboro or other Philip Morris products, right?

A.  True.

Q.  And millions of those 60 million people who quit smoked Lorillard products, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And people who smoked Liggett cigarettes quit smoking too, right?

A.  True.

Q.  Now you told the jury about some of the things that are in cigarette design, and you said, to be fair, right, that cigarette design changed over the years?

A.  That's right.

Q.  So the 60 million people today who have successfully quit smoking, they smoked modern cigarettes with modern design, correct, many of them?

A.  True.

Q.  And some of them smoked cigarettes from even before, way back to the '40s or '50s?

A.  Well, most would not be included in that 60 million.  The modern cigarette really dates from 1913 with the blended cigarette.

Q.  All right.  So 60 million people who quit smoking, they smoked modern cigarettes?

A.  True.

Q.  Let's talk about some of the designs. You showed the jury ventilated filters.  They're the filters that are perforated to let more air out; more smoke gets in them?

A.  True.

Q.  Most of the 60 million people who successfully quit smoking smoked cigarettes that had those ventilated filters, right?

A.  I don't know that.

Q. Let's say of the 60 million people who quit, judging on how popular ventilated filters are, about what portion would have smoked those cigarettes?

A.  You know, I'd have to go and calculate because many of the brands, you know, went from an unvented to a vented filter over time, although

Q.  All right.  You'd agree that millions of people who have smoked ventilated filters have successfully quit smoking?

A.  I don't know the number, but I would say the people who smoke ventilated filters do quit smoking.

Q.  And 60 million people, who most of those people had the modern filter on their cigarette, they weren't smoking unfiltered?

A.  That's true.

Q.  Okay.  And you talked about design and different types of nicotine plants and different types of nicotine yields, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And you talked about the modern cigarette.  You said it was engineered, right?

A.  It is.

Q.  And that nicotine yield, the specific amount of nicotine that was in the cigarettes those 60 million people smoked, it did not stop them from quitting, right?

A.  Well, sure, it prevented � it forced people to struggle to quit.  Most people who have quit struggled to finally refrain.

A.  They reported themselves as former smokers when they were asked if they had smoked 100 cigarettes.

Q. It's not something the tobacco company is making up; the Surgeon General is relying on it?

A.  Virtually every cigarette because it was used in different parts of the manufacturing process, from curing up through the actual manufacture.

Q.  And the use of sugar to make tobacco taste better goes back more than a century, right?

A.  It's not just for taste.  It has some physiological impact as well.

Q.  And the use of sugar in cigarettes goes back more than a century, does it not?

A.  Yes, it does.

Q.  In fact, there are reports that the Native Americans, when they were smoking tobacco in their peace pipes, used sugars and other fruits to flavor it, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  So that's something that's before tobacco companies even existed?

A.  Yeah, I wouldn't doubt that.  You could probably find references to that in old texts and so on.

Q.  You talked about ammonia.  Ammonia is in bread, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Ammonia is in cheese, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Ammonia is in most of our baked goods?

A.  It can be.  It doesn't have to be.

Q.  You talked about a specific additive called diammonium phosphate.

A.  That's right.

Q.  And diammonium phosphate is in baked goods, correct?

A.  In some baked goods.

Q.  It's in Betty Crocker cake mix, for example.

A.  I've never looked at the ingredients in Betty Crocker's cake mix.

Q.  Okay.  So it's in some baked goods; you just haven't whipped up a Betty Crocker cake in the last few years?

A.  I haven't, sorry.

Q.  And so you know that baking soda, for example, used to be called baking ammonia?

A.  Sure.

Q.  All right.  And if you go back through

historical magazines, you'll see ads, and it will call it baking ammonia?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And it will show � in that case, in that era, it will show a lady taking a cake out of the oven, and here's an ad for baking ammonia?

A.  Sure.

Q.  All right.  Now millions of the people of the 60 million who successfully quit smoking, they smoked cigarettes that had diammonium phosphate as an additive, correct?

A.  Certainly, because I think Philip Morris started adding it to their products in 1965.

Q.  Okay.  So it's been used in at least some brands.  You don't know which specific brands or which specific times it was used in, if

17 Ms. Cooper ever smoked any, right?

A.  Well, I do know that it didn't appear in

19 Winston until 1979.

Q.  Okay.

A.  And then they added it.

Q.  Right, and not to the menthols; you know that?

A.  That's true.  Menthol has a similar effect of reducing harshness.  So diammonium

13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1871

phosphate is another chemical that does that.

Q.  You didn't mean to suggest to the jury that the Winston Menthols that Ms. Cooper smoked actually used diammonium phosphate, right?

A.  No.

Q.  Because Reynolds does not put diammonium phosphate in menthols, right?

A.  That is true.

Q.  Okay.  And she only smoked menthols?

A.  She only smoked menthol.

Q.  So back to the 60 million.  Of the 60

diammonium phosphate goes back 50 years, most of those people smoked cigarettes with that type of ammonia in them, right?

A.  That type of ammonia.  There are other pH modifiers that are used.

Q. And you know that diammonium phosphate, one of the reasons it's in bread and baked goods is it can bring out sugars, right?

A.  Sure.

Q. And there are types of sugars in plants called pyrazines, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  That's pyrazine?

A.  Pyrazines. Q.  Pyrazines.

You know more chemistry than I do. Pyrazines are in tobacco.  It's one of the many sugars � let's start from the beginning.

Tobacco, as it grows in the ground, has a lot of different types of sugars in it, correct?

A.  It has some sugar in it.  Different types of tobacco have different amounts.

Q.  Okay.  And you said depending on what type of leaf or what type of blend, what type of tobacco �

A.  Timing.  When the leafs are harvested

14 makes a difference, where on the plant you get it.

The soil conditions make a difference.  A lot of factors.

Q.  For example, you mentioned soil.  The tobacco grown in North Carolina or Virginia would have different sugar than the tobacco grown here in Florida?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And it would have different � I'm sorry, it would have different sugar levels than the Turkish tobacco grown in, say, Turkey or Greece or Egypt?

A.  Most of that tobacco is not grown in Turkey or Greece or Egypt.

Q.  But all those have different types of tobacco have sugar in them, right?

A. They have different amounts of sugar in them.

Q.  And so I think you said the 60 million people who quit, their cigarettes had sugar in the tobacco?

A.  Sure.  Sugar is commonly used for curing.  Yes.

Q.  And one of the types of sugar that's in tobacco, natural tobacco that grows in the ground, is called pyrazine, right?

A.  Sure.  That's a byproduct of the burning, and you get these pyrazines, and they can come from natural sugars or high fructose corn syrup, for example, which is a primary ingredient in most of the products.

Q. And you know that diammonium phosphate, as used in some tobacco brands, can increase the amount of sugar, right?

A.  Sure.

Q. And, in fact, there are tobacco company documents where they say:  Diammonium phosphate

increases pyrazines and flavorable compounds,
	

right?
	

A.  Sure, yeah, for particularly burley
	

tobacco.
	

Q.  And so those documents, the documents
	

that say that diammonium phosphate increases sugar
	

in tobacco, that's among the 60 million pages of
	

documents that are out there, right?
	

A.  Sure.
	

Q.  And you've only got so many hours in the
	

day, so you haven't read all 60 million pages,
	

right?
	

A.  Yes.
	

Q.  You've only read about 59 million,
	

right?
	

A.  I've read a lot.
	

Q.  Okay.
	

A.  But certainly not 60 million.  I don't
	

think anybody could possibly do that.
	

Q.  And luckily you didn't show the jury 60
	

million pages of documents in this trial, right?
	

A.  Thankfully.  It may have seemed like it,
	

but no.
	

Q.  But you did choose which documents �
	

well, let me ask you:  Who chose the documents

that you showed to the jury today?  Was it you or the lawyers or both?

A.  I chose the documents.

Q.  All right.  And so you didn't show the jury though any documents that say diammonium phosphate increases sugar in tobacco?

A.  No.

Q. Okay. Now let's talk about Ms. Cooper, the smoker in this case.

A.  Okay.

Q. When she smoked her first cigarette, she said that her brother was the one that encouraged her to smoke the very first cigarette, right?

A.  Yeah, her brother John.

Q. Her brother John. And her brother John had been taking her father's cigarettes from her father's pack for some time, right?

A.  That was the explanation I heard, yes.

Q. So brother John was smoking before Mary Cooper?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And he � when I say "stealing," I'm not being critical.  He steals a few cigarettes or sneaks a few cigarettes from his dad, and one day he told Mary:  Let's go smoke, right?

A.  Yeah, uh-huh.

Q.  And Mary makes it very clear that he encouraged her, not the other way around?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Okay.  So there was no one from a tobacco company in the room at that time?

A.  No.

Q.  All right.  And he encouraged her, and, in fact, on that day, they did go off, and Mary smoked her first cigarette in the woods?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And it was her brother's idea?

A.  Yes.

Q.  You told the jury about smoking initiation.  You talked about that.  That means starting smoking?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And you said, because I wrote it down, you said:  The most common initial reaction � okay.  Here it is.

The most common initial reaction to the first cigarette is lightheadedness.  You feel a bit dizzy, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  Now when Mary Cooper smoked her

pgNbr=669
15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1877

1 first cigarette, she had a much more serious

2 reaction than just feeling a little dizzy, right?

3      A.  That's right.

4      Q.  She said she coughed her head off?

5      A.  That's right.

6      Q.  So the first cigarette she smoked was

7 [menthol? A.  Yeah, Belair

9      Q.  Belair Menthols, and I won't repeat it,

10 but you told the jury repeatedly that menthol is

11 smoother and not as harsh, right?

12      A.  Compared to the regulars, yeah.

13      Q.  So even though the first cigarette that

14 iMary Cooper smoked was menthols, not as harsh, she

still, in her own words, said she coughed her head off?

A.  Right.  She was in the learning phase.

Q.  Right.  And it was her brother who was encouraging her to learn to smoke?

A.  He had gotten the cigarettes, yeah, and they went together to have the cigarettes.

Q.  And after she choked down the first one or coughed her head off, to use her term, her brother encouraged her to smoke that second cigarette, right?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  And from then on, for at least a while, it was her brother who would supply her the cigarettes, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Because she � at least in the early stages, she would not sneak the cigarettes from her dad; her brother John would?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Now in those early days, she wouldn't smoke in front of her dad; they'd sneak off into the woods, right?

A.  When she was 11 and 12.

Q.  And sometimes she'd smoke on the porch, but she wouldn't smoke on the porch if her dad was around at that early age?

A.  At the very early age, that's true.  I think with her dad later, when she was smoking every day.

Q.  And when she started smoking, she didn't tell her dad, early stage?

A.  The very early stage, that's true. Later, the dad saw her smoking.

decided to smoke another cigarette, she said: Yes, we did it?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  Now there came a time when her brother John started getting cigarettes from a different source, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  Her brother John would get the cigarettes now from their grandmother's store, and he would give the cigarettes to Mary Cooper?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And so Ms. Cooper's grandmother had what she described as a general store?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And they sold cigarettes?

A. That's right, out in the rural area of Chatham, North Carolina.

Q. And in the beginning, her brother John would just take some cigarettes from the store, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And eventually Ms. Cooper would take cigarettes but she would leave money; she'd buy them, right?

A.  Yes, she started buying cigarettes.

A.  That's right.

Q.  And then she started buying them openly?

A.  Correct.

Q.  All right.  You agree that Ms. Cooper was born on September 15th, 1951, right?

A.  I do.

Q.  All right.  So I'm going to put up that fact.

I think this is in your notes.  You'll tell me, but I have that on Tuesday, you said that she started smoking on a regular basis around age 14 and a half to 15; is that right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  So if she's born in September 1951, right �

A.  That's right.

Q.  � she turns 14 in September, 1965, she's 14 and a half in March 1966, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  So I'm going to put 14 and a half to 15, regular smoker, right?

A.  Actually it's recorded as smoking

daily.

Q.  Okay.  I'll put in parentheses "daily" so we know for sure.

All right.  So 14 and a half to 15 is either March 1966 or September 1966.  Okay?

All right.  So regular smoker somewhere between March 1966 to September 1966.

The pack, the warning, the caution that you talked about:  Caution:  Smoking may be hazardous to your health, that started appearing on all packs on January 1st, 1966, right?

A.  All packs produced at that point, although the existing packs on the market were allowed to stay there.  So it took a couple of

15 months for them to sell out.

Q. Okay. And you know Mary agreed and you agree, correct, that every pack that she bought, which was later, had the warnings on them, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And when she became a regular smoker, even if it was at the earliest, the warning was already on the packs, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  So I'm going to put, based on what you've told us:  Warning already on packs.

A.  That's right.

Q.  Okay.  So on Page 6 of your notes, you wrote down that Mary Cooper testified under oath, and if you look, it's about the eighth or ninth bullet point �

A.  I see it.

Q.  � by the time I was 16, I was buying my own cigarettes, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  So that's what she said under oath, right?

A.  That's right.

Q. So age 16 � and I'm going to put "buying" � age 16, that would be at least September 1967, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  The warning had been on the packs since January 1966.  That would be a year and a half, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  And so there isn't a dispute between us in this case, right, that every pack of cigarettes she bought had the warning on it, right?

A.  That's true.

Q.  Now �

A.  I think she told � your medical exam, she had mentioned age 15.  That's where I was getting the 15.

Q.  And if it was 15, then it would be September '66, right?

A.  Sure.  Yeah.  She's very young.  She's buying her packs.

Q.  Right.  September '66.  So even if she was 15, the warning had already been on the pack for nine months by then?

A.  Sure.

Q.  All right.  Now she was purchasing those cigarettes underage, correct?

A.  Sure.

Q.  You know it was against the law in North Carolina to sell or give cigarettes to a minor who was below age 17?  You know that, right?

A.  I actually haven't looked at the North Carolina law.  There were different laws in different states as to the age.

Q.  But if her grandmother was selling her cigarettes, that wasn't something that was consistent with North Carolina law, was it?

A.  I don't know what the law was in North Carolina at that time.

Q.  Now let's talk � let's go back a bit to 1964.

The Surgeon General's report � first, let me put here so we have the dates, pack warning is January 1st, '66, is the law?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And the Surgeon General's report of 1964 that you and Mr. Hardee talked about a lot, that was January of 1964, right?

A.  January 11th.

Q.  January 11th.  Okay.  So I'm going to write that down.

Just to save space, sometimes we call the Surgeon General's reports the SGR's, right, for Surgeon General's reports, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  So the 1964 SGR, the Surgeon General's report, came out January 11th.  So when the Surgeon General's report came out, that was two years at least before Mary Cooper was a daily smoker, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And when the Surgeon General's report came out, that was more than three years � well, two or three years, I guess depending on � you

said 15 � before she ever started buying cigarettes, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now you put in your notes that Mary Cooper did not pay attention to the 1964 Surgeon General's reports, right?

A.  I did.  That was in her deposition on Page 540.

Q.  Okay.  And let me ask you how you take your notes.  Did you write down everything that you thought was important to your opinion when you read her testimony and you took your notes?

A.  The way I take my notes when I read a deposition, I get a yellow highlighter and I read things, and things that are relevant to the criteria for my assessment of her addiction, brand histories and so on, to know a little bit about the brand histories and what she knew about the health risks of smoking, what she was exposed to, because these are typically the questions I'm asked, I just highlight them.

And then I go back through the notes that I've highlighted � in this case, I think there were 23 different depositions I had � and I went and just typed up the highlights and prepared

those so when I went into my deposition to answer questions I'd have a reference rather than having to go through thousands of pages.

There's no way that anybody feasibly can remember all those things.

Q.  Did you put in your notes that every pack of cigarettes that Ms. Cooper bought had the warning on it?

A.  No, because I know when the warnings went on the pack, and I do have in my notes the years that she was smoking different packs.

Q.  Okay.

A.  So I sort of didn't have to do a statement like that.

Q.  Did you put in your notes the fact that

16 Ms. Cooper had actually seen and heard news

reports about the 1964 Surgeon General's reports?

A.  No.

Q.  Okay.  You just told the jury what page that was on, right?  You said Page 540 of her sworn testimony?

A.  That's right, 540 and 541 actually.

Q.  Right.  And that's what you were relying on and putting in your notes from her sworn testimony, those two pages?

A.  It's just a bullet, and I said:  As a 13-year-old, I wasn't paying attention to the Surgeon General, is what she said.

Q.  And my question is:  You were relying on those two pages that you just told the jury about, correct?

A.  It's just in my notes.  I rely on everything, not just what's in the notes.  I'd be happy to look at anything that's been said.

They were just a shorthand reference so when I was going to do the deposition I'd be able to be able to pull things up rather than going through everything.

MR. BASS:  Judge, I'd just ask if

15 Mr. Belasic is going to reference the notes if he

can just point him to the note.

THE COURT:  When it's pertinent to the question, he should.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  So let's look at Page 540 of Ms. Cooper's sworn testimony that you have just talked about. A.  Okay.

MR. BELASIC:  Would you put 540 up on the screen?

Well, we can get it to you. Just let me ask one question. MR. BASS:  Sure. Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So, Dr. Cummings, there were actually three volumes of Ms. Cooper's sworn testimony, correct? A.  Correct.

Q.  Okay.  And many pages, right? A.  Sure.

Q.  All right.  She gave a lot of information?

A.  Sure. Q.  Okay.

A.  Three sittings, I think, she went through.

MR. BELASIC:  Kevin, can you give

21 Mr. Bass files one and two just to save time?

THE WITNESS:  Do you have a copy for me? Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  I do.

on the screen?
	

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  We'll go through
	

everything that you looked at on those pages.
	

A.  Sure.
	

Q.  I assume you started right there at Page
	

15, right, where she says she was 13, correct?
	

A.  Actually I read the whole deposition,
	

but where I'm recording is at the bottom there.
	

Q.  Okay.  So it says:  Soon after you
	

started smoking, there was a Surgeon General
	

report that came out in '64.  Do you remember
	

that?
	

'64?
	

Uh-huh.
	

Oh, good Lord, please.  I would have
	

paid no attention to that.
	

So that's what you wrote down:  Paid no
	

attention to it, right?
	

A.  That's right.
	

Q.  All right.  Then the questioning goes
	

on:  Why not?
	

Come on.  I was 13 years old.  Come on.
	

Every 13-year-old got time to look at Surgeon
	

General �

MR. BELASIC:  Just keep going all the way down.  Show the jury the whole thing.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Give me a break, right?  They were all out playing and smoking and having a good time.

So you see that, right?

I've read it correctly, right?

A.  You did.

Q.  And then the lawyer asks her:  Right. I'm not talking about the actual report.  It was big news back then.

And you saw in your notes what she said about the news.

A.  Sure.

Q.  She said:  Of course had seen it.  I heard it.  It was everywhere.  They plastered it everywhere, just like they plastered the TV ad commercial on the cigarettes, just like the billboards were full.  You never seen a billboard driving down the street that didn't have a cigarette on it.

So obviously she did not read the 400-or 500-page Surgeon General's report, but she said she saw the news about the 1964 Surgeon General's report.

A.  Yeah, and she gives the context for that a little bit later.

Q.  Okay.  Now let's talk about the pack warnings.

A.  Okay.

Q.  Ms. Cooper said she saw � you'll tell me if I'm wrong.  Ms. Cooper said she saw the warning on the pack once but then never paid any attention to it again; is that fair?

A.  Yeah, I think that's what she said.

Q.  Okay.  And that was the pack warning that came out in 1966?

A.  I'm not sure if that was the reference or not or whether it was one of the other warnings, because they changed over time.

Q.  Now she stopped smoking some time in 2001 when she had her larynx removed, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  So from the time the warning was on the packs, before she was a regular smoker, before she bought it, it was 35 years until she quit, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And Ms. Cooper, based on your review of her testimony, Ms. Cooper said that she only saw

the warning once, once in 35 years, is what she said, right?

A. I'm not sure if that's exactly what she said. I think she said she didn't pay attention to the warning.

Q.  You've talked to a lot of smokers.  Do you think it's true that in 35 years she never even saw the warning more than one time?

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Commenting on the �

THE COURT:  The way it's phrased, I sustain it.

Q. (BY MR. BELASIC) Well, you accepted � you took that testimony into consideration, right?

A.  Sure.  I took everything into consideration.

Q.  And when you looked � we've already talked about the fact that, on some issues, there were differences between what Ms. Cooper told you and what she had said in her deposition under oath, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And sometimes � and you've written them down in your handwriting on the notes, right?

A.  There's small variations, but, yes, I did look for, you know, differences, of course.

Q.  And sometimes there were differences in what she said when she was under oath and what she said when the psychiatrist examined her, correct?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And sometimes there were differences between what she told you and what she told the defense psychiatrist, right?

A.  There really weren't a lot of differences, but there were � the specifics were

13 maybe off a little bit in terms of the number of

cigarettes she reported smoking at a very young age.

I think in one case she said, you know, six cigarettes a day.  Another time she said a half a pack or something.

So there wasn't really like ten.  So there wasn't huge differences, but I did make notes as to where there was any difference whatsoever.

Q.  In your view, were any of the differences in her testimony between when she was under oath and when she talked to you significant?

A.  Not in my opinion as to whether she was addicted, no, not at all.

Q.  Did you take any piece of information that she give you � that she gave you to try to assess whether it was accurate information, or did you assume it was all accurate?

A.  No.  I don't make any of those assumptions.  I look at all the information in total.

So I look at the medical records, the depositions that I was given, the report from the

the defense.

I look at all of that, my interview with her, and I take it all into consideration and just look at � I weigh that based on my assessment as to whether she would be addicted or not.

That's what I was asked to do in a case-specific basis for this case, and there's no doubt in my mind she was addicted based on everything I have reviewed, even though there are slight inconsistencies.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, the question had nothing to do with addiction.  It was just whether he weighed evidence.

MR. BASS:  Judge, I think it was an open-ended question.

THE COURT:  It's borderline.  I'll let it stand, Mr. Belasic.

Stay on topic, please, Dr. Cummings.

Go ahead.  Next question. Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Let's get back to the weighing of evidence.

When you, as you described, weighed all the evidence for your opinion, did you regard the claim that she had only seen the warning once in 35 years as accurate?

MR. BASS:  Objection, Judge.

THE COURT:  The way it's phrased, I'll let him answer that question.  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  You know, I knew the pack warnings went on in 1966, and, as I recall � and I don't have the actual testimony in front of me to know the actual words � she said she didn't pay attention to the warnings.  So I took that as accurate.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Okay.  So only saw it once, you took that as accurate?

A.  Sure � well, I don't know if only saw once.  That's why I'm not recalling the exact

phrase, and I think I've said that a couple times. I'd be happy to look at the phrase if you have it.

Q.  Now you noted in your notes, Page 7, she said she would not � often she would not tell the doctor the truth about how much she smoked because she would be embarrassed, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And so � and that's not uncommon, right?

A.  It's not uncommon.

Q.  Smokers do it all the time, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And the reason smokers underestimate their smoking is because they know that they're going to get a lecture from the doctor:  Quit smoking.  Smoking is bad for you, right?

A.  That's maybe one of the reasons, or they're embarrassed about their smoking, which is what she said.

Q.  Right.

A.  And she was having health problems, and

23 most of the medical records were related to the

time after she began to have health problems related to smoking.

Q.  And the reason she was embarrassed to tell the doctor how much she smoked is she knew the doctor would tell her she had to quit?

A.  She said she was embarrassed because she was continuing to smoke after, you know, having symptoms of her cancer early on.

Q.  Right, because she knew it was harmful to her at that point, and she continued to smoke anyway?

A.  Sure.  Yeah.  That was �

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Argumentative. Repetitive.

THE COURT:  Both of those objections are overruled, and the answer stands. THE WITNESS:  Yes.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Okay.  In fact, you noted in your notes that her own doctor, at a time before she had larynx cancer, when she had the surgery, told her that she must quit smoking?

A.  Yes.

try to quit, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And you know that she said under oath she did not try to quit at that point?

A.  At that time, yes.

Q.  And so there's no doubt she had personalized the risk of smoking at that point. She had surgery and a doctor's warning, right?

A.  No doubt.  She understood that smoking was harmful and continued use of an addictive substance.  That was part of my assessment as to her addiction.

Q.  In fact, your opinion is based on the fact that even when a doctor gave her a personalized warning and even when she had polyp surgery, which turned out not to be cancer, even then she did not try to quit?

A.  Well, she was having � yeah, I agree with that.  She continued to smoke right up till the time that she had her larynx removed.

Q.  So let's put aside the 60 million who quit.  When we're talking about Ms. Cooper, a personalized warning even from a doctor did not change her smoking behavior?

A.  Well, she was trying to quit during that

period of time, so � but she was not successful in quitting, I will grant you that.

Q.  Well, let's go back.  I thought we had agreed:  When Dr. Shapiro told her after the polyp surgery to quit smoking, she told him she would try, but she said under oath she did not even try?

A.  With regards to that particular encounter, yes.

Q.  And so we know that a personalized warning from a doctor, she didn't even try in response to that warning?

A.  Not from that particular warning.

Q.  Okay.  And we'll talk about all the warnings.

Let's talk now � I want to ask you some questions about when she did stop smoking for a while.

But first we're here in '64 and '66, and I want to talk about some other information she got.

So we agree '60s, didn't try to quit, right?

A.  Agree.

Q.  If I flip this over for the '70s, '70s,

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221

did not try to quit?

A.  That's what she told me, yes.

Q.  Now in 1968 when she was 17, she got

4 married to Charles Bray, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Okay.  So 1968, 17, marries Charles Bray, and unless people think it's rude, maybe I'll ask a couple questions while I'm still writing.

Mr. Bray was a smoker, right?

A.  Yes, he was.

Q.  All right.  He smoked Winstons?

A.  That's my understanding.

Q.  All right.  And that's probably why she switched because she said she didn't remember, right?

A.  Well, it's probably because �

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Speculation. THE COURT:  He can answer if he knows. Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  I think Winston Menthols were introduced in 1967.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Okay.  So he was smoking at the time that she was smoking, right?

A.  I don't think he was smoking menthols.

A.  That's right.

Q.  She � at that point, she graduates from high school in '68, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  It's legal to smoke, right, for her?

A.  Sure.

Q.  She was working at the Mayflower plant, full time at the textile mill, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  She was an adult?

A.  She was 18, sure.

Q.  Married, 18, employed, legal to buy cigarettes, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  All right.  You reviewed the sworn testimony of Mr. Bray, correct?

Q.  And Mr. Bray, he was subject to the same information environment that she was, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So let's say that, for example, he was in the same information environment with the same advertisements for cigarettes as Ms. Cooper, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And he was in the same information environment � he's living with her �

A.  Yeah.

Q.  � when it came to news and information about whether cigarettes were bad?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And her first husband said, in 1968 when she was 17 or 18, he said:  Everybody knew that smoking was harmful to health.  That's what he said under oath, right?

A.  He did say that.

Q.  And if you can look at your notes �

A.  Yes.

Q.  And she would go on to manage the Take One Lounge, the club we talked about � well, we didn't talk about it, but that the jury has heard about, the Take One Lounge?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And so she married her second husband, right, Charles Hollingsworth, in 1976, correct?

A.  That's right.

A.  Yes.

Q.  I'm sorry.  I can already see people here mouthing, "It's Larry," right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  All right.  She didn't marry two Charleses.

So Larry Hollingsworth, he's also a smoker?

A.  Right.

Q.  Only now it's the next decade.  It's the 1970s.  So in '76, she's about 25 years old, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  And at this time she's never tried to quit smoking, right?

A.  That's true.

Q.  Because she doesn't � by her own words, she does not attempt to quit smoking until the mid 1980s; is that right?

A.  Well, she told me in the mid '80s, and then in another place, the mid '90s.

Q.  Okay.  And when we get to the '80s, you remind me, and we'll talk about that.

A.  Sure.

Q. Now Mr. Hollingsworth also said that there was no need to tell her smoking was bad because she already knew, right?

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Didn't
	

Mr. Hollingsworth indicate that they knew the
	

risks at that time?
	

A.  What he said is, when married to Mary
	

Cooper:  I don't guess I realized it.
	

This is in regards to the harms of
	

smoking.
	

Was it serious or whatever, but, no, we
	

never talked about it.
	

That was on Page 46.  That's what I
	

recorded in my notes.

if he had ever observed her trying to quit,
	

correct?
	

A.  Yes.
	

Q.  And he said he had never seen her try to
	

quit, right?
	

A.  That's true.
	

Q.  And the same thing for her first
	

husband.  Her first husband reported that she
	

didn't try to quit in the '60s, right?
	

A.  Consistent with her testimony, yes.
	

Q.  And second husband Larry said he never
	

heard her say that she wanted to quit, right?

A.  True.

Q.  And there's actually no evidence in this case, at least that you've reviewed, that suggests that she even wanted to quit in the '60s or the '70s, correct?

A.  That's true � well, there's some evidence testimony that Mary gives around her pregnancy with her daughter in the late 1960s as to what she knew about the health risks of smoking during pregnancy.

Q.  Well, my question �

A.  And she talks about this in relationship to what she would have done had she known.

even wanted to quit smoking in either the 1960s or the 1970s?

A.  Based on what she knew, yes.

Q.  All right.  Okay.  So � but as you've told us, the Surgeon General says that in the '60s and the '70s, 30 million other Americans at that time quit smoking successfully?

A.  True.

Q.  And they saw, they had the same ads out there that Ms. Cooper did, right?

A.  True.

Q.  Okay.  And that's � that's 30 million, and the dates are 1964 to 1979; is that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And so they had the same advertisement, the same stuff that was on the news, the same stuff that Mr. Bass showed you the tobacco companies said, and those 30 million people quit, right?

A.  Thirty million people quit, right.

Q.  And those 30 million people, they wanted to quit, and they made a choice, right?

A.  Well, some of them had health problems,

24 many of them did, which � and then they quit.

THE COURT:  It's overruled.  The question related to evidence.  So the objection is overruled.

You can answer.

THE WITNESS:  I don't know what she � what she said is she didn't really know about some of the risks, and she said had she known around the pregnancy, which is the only bit of evidence that I recorded, that she would have quit had she known that it could be harmful to her baby.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Well, I'm sorry, my question is different.

There's no evidence that she actually tried to quit in the '70s or that she actually wanted to quit in the '70s, correct?  That's my question.

A.  Okay.  There's no evidence that she tried to quit in the '70s.

Q.  But, Doctor, you understand my question is different.  I'm not talking about what you say had she known.

I'm talking about the way she actually lived her life.  There is no statement by her or anyone else that she wanted to quit before the 1980s, correct?

to quit even though her own husband said:
	

Everybody knew smoking was dangerous, when he was
	

married to her in 1968, two years before she was
	

pregnant, right?
	

A.  True.
	

Q.  Now you just said she might have been
	

able to quit.  Was she capable of quitting smoking
	

in 1970?

woman; do you agree?

of that restaurant?

on what you told me, has not tried to quit, and we're going to talk about what happened.

All right.  She has a daughter, Jacqueline Mechelle Blackwood.  I think she goes by Mechelle; is that right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And so her daughter Mechelle was born in 1970, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And her daughter Mechelle grew up around her mom, Ms. Cooper, who smoked, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And, like Ms. Cooper, her daughter started smoking, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And, like Ms. Cooper's father,

17 Ms. Cooper left cigarettes around where her

daughter Mechelle could take some and start, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And so the same thing happened in her family, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  But Ms. Cooper caught her, she says, caught her daughter Mechelle when she was 12 or

13, right?

A.  That's correct.

Q.  So Mechelle was born in 1970.  So 12 or 13 would be 1982 or 1983, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Okay.  Catches daughter smoking.

Now Ms. Cooper first smoked in front of her father way back when when she was about 14, right?

A. She was smoking at 11 or 12, I think, in front of her father. It's not clear exactly when that was.

Q. She says that she smoked openly in front of her father at 14?  That's my question.

A.  Yes.

Q.  And when her father caught her, he didn't do anything except he said:  I know you smoke.  Can I have one, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  So that happened.

She had a different reaction, Ms. Cooper had a very different reaction when her daughter

23 Mechelle was smoking, when she caught her smoking?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And the first thing she did was she told

United Reporting, Inc. 954.525.2221
pgNbr=709
1917

1 her not to smoke, right?

2      A.  Yes.

3      Q.  So she told her not to smoke, and in

4 Ms. Cooper's own words, she told her daughter

5 Mechelle smoking was bad for her, right?

6      A.  Yes.

7      Q.  All right.  So she not only told her

8 daughter not to smoke, she warned her smoking was

9 bad for her.

10           And this was in 1982 or 1983 that

11 Ms. Cooper thought it was too dangerous for her

12 daughter to smoke, right?

13      A.  Roughly, yes.

14      Q.  Now the reason I brought up the dancers

15 at the Take One Lounge is that Ms. Cooper said she

16 had sort of like a mother relationship to the

17 dancers, right?

18      A.  Right.

19      Q.  She was a bit older than them.  She was

20 obviously their boss.  They looked up to her.  She

21 was like their mom, right?

22      A.  Sure.

23      Q.  And one of the things she did as a

24 mother to the dancers at the Take One Lounge is

25 make sure they didn't use drugs, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  But she says they did anyway, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  She also said that she tried to convince the dancers to quit smoking, right?

A.  I'm not sure if she did or not.

Q.  Okay.

A.  I don't recall.  That wasn't part of my assessment for whether she was addicted or not.

Q.  You know, you assessed more than whether she was addicted, right, because yesterday when

the jury what you thought Ms. Cooper knew about the risks of smoking and whether she had been deceived, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  So you were looking � when you went through the sworn testimony, you were looking for evidence of what she knew, what she saw, and what she believed, right?

A.  Yeah, I looked at all of that.

Q.  And you read her depositions, right?

A.  I did.

Q.  Okay.  All right.  So if you can look at your notes, let's just make sure, you did not

Q.  Okay.

MR. BELASIC:  So, Counsel, that's on Page -- that's on Page 130.

THE WITNESS:  Do you have a copy of that for me?

MR. BELASIC:  Kevin tells me, Mr. Bass, it's this.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  What they call the contingency compulsory medical examination, you reviewed that?  That was when the psychiatrist talked to her, right?

A.  Okay.

MR. BELASIC:  May I approach, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  You may.

A.  Well, not so much different because I wrote down notes on this exam as well.

Q.  Right.  But we've seen you would leave some things out of your notes or you didn't write down everything?  Let's be fair, you didn't write down everything?

A.  Sure.  Most of it is extraneous in the areas that I was looking at.

Q.  And, for example, it was extraneous to you that she said:  I had seen and heard the news about the Surgeon General, because you didn't

14 mention that, right?

A.  No, I knew about when the reports had come out.

Q.  Okay.

MR. BELASIC:  So can we put Page 130 of the materials up on the screen, Your Honor?

MR. BASS:  Judge, can we approach?  I think it's objectionable to cross on the defense CME.

THE REPORTER:  Yes.  Thank you.

THE COURT:  What's the objection?

MR. BASS:  Judge, the objection is hearsay, and to cross on the CME of a defense expert, particularly because we're unsure if the defense expert is going to come in to be cross-examined on the CME proceedings as well. That's our objection.

THE COURT:  This is your client who made statements to a CME during a court-ordered exam, and he's cross-examining him about what your client said, and you're saying that's hearsay?

MR. BASS:  Yes, sir, that's our objection.

THE COURT:  Then the objection is overruled.

(The sidebar discussion was concluded and the following was held in open court:)

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  So we were going to read � I'm sorry, I think I'm blocking somebody's view.

So we were going to show Page 130 of the transcript where Ms. Cooper was talking to the psychiatrist and what she said about smoking and the dancers.

Q. (BY MR. BELASIC) All right. So on Line 10, she's asked: Did you like that kind of work? I mean, did you �

Answer:  It was my first time working like that, so �

Uh-huh.

� you know, I did.  Those girls, they worked for me.  They didn't really have any family and people around them, and they sort of looked up to me.  Even though that I was only like five years older than most of them, they still �

Question:  Yeah.

Answer:  � kind of looked up to me, you know, and some of them, I'd talk with them about smoking, and some of them stopped smoking.

Really?

Answer:  But I couldn't do it.

And she worked at the Take One Lounge from 1979 to 1990, right? A.  Yes.

Q. So in the 1980s, she wasn't just telling her daughter to stop smoking, she was also telling

A.  Sure.

Q.  So I'm putting down:  Tells dancers to quit, and some of them did?

A.  Apparently.

Q.  You agree other people that Ms. Cooper warned not to smoke include her grandchildren; she told her grandchildren not to smoke, right?

A.  Yes, she did.

Q.  And she told her grandchildren not to smoke in the 1980s, right, or was that later?

A.  I think it was in the �

Q.  I want to be fair here.  I'm trying to figure out how old her grandchildren are, but you tell me.  But I'll write down:  Told grandchildren not to smoke; is that fair?

A.  I believe that she did, yes.  She was home-schooling them.

Q.  So there was a period of time when Mary Cooper was still smoking, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And she was home-schooling her own grandchildren, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.
	And that was, what, 1990s?
	

A.

people not to smoke because she knew that smoking
		

was dang(

her fath(

got that

A.  Sure.

Q.  Now in 1984, her father died of lung cancer, right?

Q.  And they've been together for decades since then?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And outside of her own blood relatives, he knows her probably better than anyone during that time, right?

A.
	I think that's � I do recall that,

him, right?

A.  I'm not sure.  I didn't see his medical records to know.

Q.  Okay.  And Ms. Cooper says that she didn't have any idea that her dad's lung cancer, which she says heart disease, was caused by smoking, right?

A.  True.  She didn't connect the dots.

Q.  She didn't connect the dots, but, in fact, in her own words, right around in the mid '80s, she stopped smoking for a while, right?

A.  She did.  She was trying to use the gum, I believe, and other things, trying to quit.

Q.  So early '80s, tells her daughter not to smoke, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  Some time in the '80s, tells dancers not to smoke?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Dad dies of lung cancer.  She says it's heart disease, right?

A.  Yes.

after that?

A.  She's quitting in the '80s, yes.

Q.  So those dots are together, right?  She believed that smoking was dangerous years earlier when she warned her daughter and tried to quit after her dad died?

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  It's overruled.  He can answer the question.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Right?  So she knew that smoking was dangerous?

A.  She knew it was dangerous, not necessarily to her.  In fact, Bob Aaron, who met her in the 1980s, says she was healthy when � in good health, as he said, on Page 57.

Q.  Well, you just told us she knew it was dangerous then.  She tried to quit, right, according to you; you've told the jury the mid 1980s?

A.  Absolutely she was trying to quit in the '80s and the '90s.

(Jury exited courtroom at 11:59 a.m.)

THE COURT:  Let's see if we can offer some professional courtesy to the doctor about his evening.

Do we think we're going to finish with him or not finish with him or what?

MR. BELASIC:  I don't think I'm going to finish and allow the others to do it.

THE COURT:  All right.

MR. BELASIC:  I've always tried to be fast with Dr. Cummings, but just want to remind the Court that I said if they finished by the end of the day yesterday we could finish.

THE COURT:  I'm not pushing anybody.

MR. BELASIC:  Okay.  But I think we're going to go into tomorrow morning.

THE COURT:  I just didn't want him to

193: CROSS EXAMINATION (Continued) BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, you had told me she told her grandchildren not to smoke, and I wrote down, told her grandchildren to smoke.  Brighter minds than mine have noticed that.  So I'll write she told her grandkids not to smoke.

When you were being questioned by Mr. Bass, you said that you started testifying against tobacco companies in 1996.

A.    Correct.

Q.    And you testified in a variety of trials in a variety of states.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And you estimated that you've testified at 80 different trials where someone was suing a tobacco company for money, right?

A.    Yes.  In my last trial I think one of the defendant lawyers had a list.

Q.    And when you or other witnesses testify in a trial, the party, whether it's the tobacco company or the plaintiffs, they have a right to take the � take a deposition, which is asking questions under oath before trial.

A.    Yes, sir.

Q.    And then three trials in May of 2013, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And I had the pleasure of cross-examining you in that Beatrice Skolnick case, right?

Q.    And then in June, two more trials and a deposition.

A.    Correct.

Q.    In July, two depositions in two different cases and a trial.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And then August of last year, two more trials.  It looks like they were back to back.

Then you got December off. A.    I did.

Q.    And you rested up.  And now in January of this year, four different trials, right, in the first

sorry.

We're listing Hartford twice, so three trials in January of this year.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And then in February, two trials, Barbara Reider and Betty Ellis, and one deposition.

A.    Okay.

1943 different cases, including this one, right?

A. Yeah. Well, I had already done this in this case and was redeposed or they added another two hours on for the deposition.

Q.    And so in about one year and eight months, so a little more than a year and a half you spent over 90 days testifying for plaintiffs suing tobacco companies.

A.    Right.  You guys know me well.

Q.    And in the last four years you told us how

your trial testimony.

A.    That's right.

Q.    But if I ask you questions before trial at a deposition you charge $500.

A.    That's right.

Q.    So you charge twice as much if I ask you the questions before trial than if the plaintiffs and I ask you questions at a trial.

A.    That's right.  Because I donate half of the fees .

Q.    Okay.  In the last four years you've made about a million dollars testifying against tobacco companies.

A.    I would say five years.

Q.    Well, let's just go back four years.  You've told us that in 2011 you made about $225,000 in tobacco lawsuits.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And you've told us in � sorry, 2012 you made about $200,000.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And then last year, and we saw your schedule, last year you made more.  You were paid about 250 to $300,000 in tobacco litigation.

A.    Yeah, worked out closer to about 250.

Q.    And this year you're certainly on schedule to be paid more than $200,000.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And that's way over half of your income is from tobacco lawsuits, correct?

A.    Sure, yeah.

Q.    You've described yourself as being in a war against tobacco.

A.    Yes, I have.

Q.    And you're a general in the war against tobacco.

A.    The Buffalo news, they used that headline

when they featured me in one of their articles.  They said I was the general.

Q.    And you wrote an article that was literally entitled "The war against tobacco."

A.    I did, in the Journal of Cancer. Q.    And you'd like to have cigarettes banned so it would not be legal to sell them.

A.    Sure.  I mean, given the harm they cause, absolutely.

Q.    Now, we've talked about how much you've testified.  You also participated in a plaintiffs' lawyer conference in Boston in 2002, correct? A.    Yes, I did.

Q.    And that conference was devoted to litigation strategy?

MR. BASS:  Object to any litigation references.  I think the ruling was it I applies to both sides.

MR. BELASIC:  Goes to bias in this case. THE COURT:  Well, it was as to the parties. He can testify as to about what he's attended, so that's overruled to that extent.  I don't know how far it will go, Mr. Bass.  Make a contemporaneous objection if you need to. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    I'm not asking you about any lawsuits, sir, but you testified at a litigation strategy conference, correct?  Not � you gave a speech.

A.    I was invited to give two talks, Northeastern University School of Law and those talks were on the research I had done around the tobacco documents that had come to me and the advertising archives.  And I did that.

Q.    And the people in attendance were mostly plaintiffs' attorneys, people who sue tobacco companies.

A.    There were plaintiffs' attorneys.  There were law students.  There were public health people there.

Q.    And, in fact, you had to sign an affidavit to get into that conference to say you had never work worked for a tobacco company.  So it was one side.

A.    Sure.

Q.    And the title of that conference was called "How to win a just tobacco verdict," right?

A.    That's right.

Q. And after you gave your speech one of the presentations there was called "The keys to a giant verdict," right?

A.    Yes.

A.    I did.

Q.    And who later hired you to be a witness in their cases.

MR. BASS:  Judge, objection.  This goes to litigation references of the parties.

MR. BELASIC:  That's the last question, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'll let him answer that question then we'll move on.

THE WITNESS:  The answer is yes. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    And you agree, you admit you have a significant bias against tobacco companies.

A.    I would hope everyone would based on what we know about the harms of tobacco.  My bias grew as a result of my knowledge.  So, yes, I have a bias.  I've said that.

Q.    And you've been candid in the past.  When you testify, you want the plaintiff to win.

A.    Yeah.  I believe that the companies have a responsibility for their actions.

Q.    And in this case you're rooting for

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=740
194

1 Ms. Cooper to win money, correct?

2     A.    Actually, I'm not rooting for anyone, but I

3 do believe that the companies, your client, has a

4 responsibility.

5     Q.    Well, my question is then that you've said

6 in past cases you're rooting for the plaintiff to win.

7     A.    And I'm giving you the context of my answer

8 in past cases.

9     Q.    Let's talk about the times � the occasions

10 on which Ms. Cooper stopped smoking for a couple of

11 hours.  We'll go into how long it was.

12           First of all, you've reviewed her medical

13 records.

14     A.    I did.

15     Q.    Right?

16     A.    Uh-huh.

17     Q.    And the medical records show that most of

18 the time when she goes in, her doctors or medical

19 professionals ask her about her smoking history.

20     A.    Well, I don't have all her medical records,

21 but I have some that really date from the time that she

22 was ill from the mid '90s.

23     Q.    And so my question is �

24     A.    And many of them did reference that they

25 told her to quit.

6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1949 Q.    She goes to the doctor, doctors ask her about her smoking history. A.    Yes. Q.    So one source of information about

smoking history?

A.    Right.

Q.    And, in fact, in your notes you summarized some information about her smoking history from medical records.  That's page 2 of your notes, correct?

A.    I did.

Q.    And the information that you summarized from her medical history says that she smoked for different numbers, 30 years, 33 years, 25 years.  I'm not going to quibble about that.  But that's one of the things that her medical history says, right?

A.    Sure.  I used the years that she had smoked to sort of give me a sense of the early part of her smoking career.  Some of them dated it as 1963, others 1964.

Q.    And her medical records also talk about when she quit, right?

A.    Yes, they do.

Q.    And first of all, we know that she quit smoking after the laryngectomy surgery in 2001,

1950 correct?

A.    Right.  Even though we have a record that says 2000.

Q.    Some of her records say 2000.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And one record even said that she quit in 1996, but we know that's not right.

A.    That's right.  Although she might have quit in 1996 but relapsed back to smoking, because there is testimony that she was trying to quit and relapsed.

Q.    We'll get to that.

In fact, she said that when Dr. Shapiro warned her, and we talked about that this morning, after the polyp surgery that she said she'd try to quit and she said under oath she did not try to quit.

A.    Yes.

Q.    Now, in the medical records of all the doctors and all the visits, do any of the medical records say that she had stopped at any point, you know, before � other with that exception, before 2000?

A.    None of the records say that before 2000.

Q.    Do any of Ms. Cooper's medical records say that she has tried to quit in the past?

A.    Before 2000, no.

Q.    Right.  So when these doctors were taking

	a

day for 30 years, there isn't any record that says,
	has

tried to quit in the past, asking for help today.
	

A.    No, I haven't seen anything like that.
	

Q.    None of the medical records indicate that
	

she has used � that she has used nicotine gum in the
	
past, correct?
	

A.    None of the records do, no.
	

Q.    And none of her medical records say that
	she

has used nicotine patches at any time.
	

A.    True.
	

Q.    None of her medical records say that she
	

ever asked even one of her doctors for help in
	

quitting, right?
	

A.    There's not a record of that.
	

Q.    And none of her medical records say that
	she

wanted to quit.
	

A.    No, that's true.  They say other things.
	

Q.    You told the jury about the Surgeon
	

General's Report of 1988.
	

A.    Yes.
	

Q.    And that was the Surgeon General's Report
	on

addiction.
	

A.    That's true.

1952

discusses not only nicotine, addiction, the definition of nicotine, or the definition of addiction, but he talks about people who try to quit and gives some scientific information about that, correct?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And one of the things that the Surgeon General discusses is what the public health community views as a serious quit attempt.

A.    Well, among other things, yes.

Q.    And the Surgeon General notes in there that

as 24 hours without smoking, correct?

A.    I think what they're referring to is some of the surveys that have been done you have to come up with a criteria of quitting, and they use 24 hours as a quit attempt.  And of course most people that do work in this field know that many people are unable to quit for 24 hours so they're underreporting quit attempts. MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, I'd like to introduce a portion of the 1988 Surgeon General's Report.  It's Exhibit AS 34.

That's a federal government agency, correct?

A.    Yes, it's part of the National Institutes of Health.

Q.    And they study smoking.

A.    Right.

Q.    And it says, "...recommended 24 hours of continuous abstinence from tobacco as the criterion for defining a quit episode."

So the definition of a quit was 24 hours without tobacco.

A.    No.

Q.    Correct?

A.    No.  It says a quit episode in establishing eligibility for sort of counting relapse you use.

Q.    Correct.

A.    So, yeah.

Q.    And that's what it says, 24 hours.

A.    It's not a definition of a quit attempt. It's a definition of when you start looking at relapse.

Q.    Okay.  It does say it's a criterion for defining a quit episode �

A.    Yes.

Q.    � and establishing eligibility.

A.    Yep.

Q.    Do you have that there?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And again we're talking here, it talks about defining relapse.  Look what it says the definition of an initial cessation.  And initial means first, correct?

A.    Right.

Q.    And cessation means ceasing smoking, quitting smoking.

A.    That's right.

Q.    So the National Working Conference on Smoking Relapse, is that also a federal government group?

A.    Urn, yes.

Q.    They recommended a duration of 24 hours of continuous tobacco abstinence to define initial cessation.

A.    Right.

Q.    Then it says a slip is � a slip was defined as a period of not more than 6 consecutive days of smoking following at least 24 hours of abstinence.

That does not apply to Ms. Cooper in this case, correct?

A.    That's true.

Q.    Smoking beyond 6 consecutive days has been defined as a relapse.

A.    Right.  This is being used for defining how you evaluate whether drugs that are offered for treatment for dependence work or not.

Q.    And then look what it says.  "These definitions of quit episodes, slip, and relapse are somewhat lenient," and they say "many investigators require a longer period of initial abstinence, e.g., 48 hours, or one week for a quit episode," right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And they regard even a few smoking occasions as a relapse.

We can put that down.

A.    Sure.

Q.    Whatever the definition is, can we agree that Ms. Cooper when she testified under oath said that she didn't quit for more than a few hours in the 1980s?

A.    No, I think she said between 12 and 24 hours, as I recall.

Q.    Okay.  So your testimony is that she stopped for 12 to 24 hours in the 1980s.

A.    Well, she said � at various times she said she would put cigarettes out of sight but would end up

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=749
1957

1 smoking again after a few hours.  And then there were

2 other times where she said 12 to 24 hours.

3     Q.    I'm talking about her deposition as well,

4 but let me ask you the question again.

5     A.    Okay.

6     Q.    In the 1980s did Ms. Cooper ever quit for

7 more than a few hours, yes or no?

8     A.    I don't know.  I don't know whether � she

9 said she maybe would go an hour, hour and a half, two

10 hours, page 273 of her deposition.  I don't know if

11 that's in the context of something in the 1980s or the

12 1990s.

13     Q.    One of the things we saw in the chart is

14 that you testified under oath in this very case just a

15 few months, ago, right, in April?

asked
	the
	question:  "In the 1980s did Ms. Cooper ever

quit f
	or more than a few hours?"
	

	
	Your answer:  "No."


	
	All right.  Now, in the 1990s did Ms. Cooper

ever quit
		for more than a few hours?

A.
	
	I think she said she quit for less than 24

hours.

tes

hours.
		


	Q.
	Let's read it into the record.
 MR. BELASIC:  Page 101, Counsel, line 5.

BY
	MR.
	BELASIC:


	Q.
	You were asked this question:  "In the 1990s

did
	Ms
	. Cooper ever go for more than a few hours

without smoking?
		

	
	"Answer:  No."


	
	MR. BASS:  Your Honor, for completeness if


	
	we could read lines 8 through 11 continuing on,


	
	please.


	
	MR. BELASIC:  Sure, Your Honor.


	
	Line 8 is, "Before she quit in 2001 did


	
	Ms. Cooper ever go more than a few hours without


	
	smoking?


	
	"Well, it was generally a few hours.  Maybe


	
	a day.  She didn't go long without smoking."

BY
	MR.
	BELASIC:


	Q.
	So your testimony then was that in the '80s

and
	'90s she didn't go for more than a few hours, and
	
in
	the
	i   2000s she went for a few hours or less than a

day

1960 A.    No, I didn't really put it in the context of those dates.  What she said is she would try to quit

few hours, maybe up to a day.  That's what she said.

Q.    And when you say that's what she said, are you talking about what she told you in the phone interview, or are you talking about what Ms. Cooper said when she was under oath?

A.    Both.

Q.    Both?

A.    Yeah.

Q.    All right.  Let's look at your notes then. Because you took notes on Mary Cooper's sworn testimony, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And if you'd look at page 6, that's where you reviewed her sworn testimony, right?

A.    Uh-huh.

Q.    And if you look on page 6 of your notes, eighth bullet point, it says, "first time I tried to quit was the mid 1980s," right?  That's in your notes.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And then four lines more "could only go a couple of hours without smoking," right?

A.    Uh-huh.

A.    Right.

Q.    Right?

And then the very next line in your notes that you put in is that she testified "I would go maybe an hour, an hour and a half, two hours."

A.    Right.  Page 273.

Q.    Right.  So your own notes show that what

for an hour and a half or two hours in quitting.

A.    Right.

Q.    And that's her sworn testimony, isn't it, sir?

A.    I have recorded out of her sworn testimony

16 my notes, and you've only read a couple of the bullets

One of the additional bullets, because she was � you can go down and find where she said she had tried to quit maybe up to a day.

Q.    Show me anyplace in her deposition testimony, sir, when she was actually under oath, that she went a day without smoking, when she was under oath.

A.    Less than a day is what she said.

Q.    Doctor, my question to you was, when she was under oath �

A.    She's under oath in that testimony.

Q.    She was?

A.    Yeah, I believe so.

Q.    Did you read it?  No.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, you can take judicial notice; she was not under oath when she appears for a medical exam.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, this is getting argumentative.

THE COURT:  I'm not getting involved in that today.

MR. GDANSKI:  She wasn't under oath. THE COURT:  You'll have to show me later and we'll have to take it up sidebar, Mr. Belasic, maybe after � BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    So let's start, there were three different times she gave information.  First she testified under oath at her deposition.  The lawyers questioned her.

25 We know there were hundreds of pages, correct?

1963

A.    Three volumes, three days.

Q. Then she talked to you on the phone � then she talked to a psychiatrist. There was a transcript of what she said, right?

A.    I had assumed that was under oath.

Q.    Then she talked to you in a phone transcript, correct?

A.    True.

Q.    Now, during three days when she had three different days to tell the lawyers every single thing she could about quitting, right, you agree, according to your own notes on pages 6 and 7, she never once said that she ever smoked for � that she ever quit for more than two hours?

A.    Yes.

Q.    So then she shows up and she is told that she is going to be examined by a psychiatrist for the defense, right?  She knew who that psychiatrist was. He told her he worked for RJ Reynolds.

A.    Sure.

Q.    And she gives a different testimony that she had quit more times.

A.    She said she had quit many times.  It was very consistent.

Q.    Now, in her sworn deposition testimony she

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=756
1964

1 said that she quit once with patches, once with gum and

2 then a couple of times cold turkey; isn't that right?

3     A.    Yeah.

4     Q.    And then when she is being interviewed by

5 someone that she was told was a defense expert she

6 changed it to one or two times a year, correct?

7     A.    No.  That was not � yes, she did say that

8 in her testimony to your expert, yes.  Tried to quit

9 many times, maybe once a year, page 63.

10     Q.    And so you knew coming into this case, based

11 on your own notes, that when she testified under oath

12 at her deposition she never said that she quit for more

13 than two hours.  You knew that.

14     A.    I knew that she had said in the deposition,

15 yes.

16     Q.    Yes.

17     A.    And then when I talked to her and I read the

18 examination and the questions, which were much more

19 specific to her smoking behavior in the medical exam

20 and also in my questioning, she said � she

21 acknowledged her quit attempts were of short duration,

22 couple of hours, not more than a day.  And that was

23 consistent, in my view, across all the information.

24     Q.    So to you, saying under oath four or five

25 different times when she had three days to respond,

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

1965 four or five times that she never tried to quit for

her telling you, her expert, who she knows is going to testify for her when she's suing for money, you think that's consistent.

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative. THE COURT:  I'll let him answer. THE WITNESS:  I don't think there was anything different than what she told me and what she stated to the lawyers under oath and what she told the RJ Reynolds' medical examination expert.  It was consistent testimony.  She made many quit attempts and they failed and they were of short duration. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    Let's back up on what I think we do agree on.  You agree she did not try to quit in the '60s or '70s, right?

MR. BASS:  Objection, asked and answered. MR. BELASIC:  Setting up foundation. THE COURT:  Don't repeat.  Go ahead.  Yes. I understand your objection, Mr. Bass. Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  Yes. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    And so you said her testimony is consistent that the first time she tried to quit was the mid 1980s, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And that's because of her father, right?

A.    No.

Q.    Isn't that what her significant other Robert Aaron said?

A.    He said she was upset about her father and he remembers that she was quitting around that time. Consistent with the testimony that she said she started to quit but not because of her father.

Q.    Ms. Cooper said that smoking relaxed her.

A.    Sure.

Q.    That she thought it did.

A.    Uh-huh.

Q.    She said that smoking was a habit that would reduce boredom.

A.    Yes.

5     Q.    And do you see at the top she's being asked

6 about her father?  He says she loved her father very

7 much, right? A.    Yes.

9     Q.          So then down at line 15 it says, "You never

10 said to   her, look, look what happened to him after

11 smoking   all those years, I don't want that to happen to

12 you, or  words to that effect."

13           And he answers, "I don't think I did."

14           And then he's asked, "Do you think it was

15 self-evident?"

16           And he said, "I don't want to get run off,

17 tnan, you know, she liked them cigarettes."

And that's the testimony of the man who lived with her � the man who was dating her, not lived with her, and got to see her every day, knew her very well.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And then when he was asked, well, what was her reaction when you brought up cigarettes � it says, "Was that Ms. Cooper's reaction whenever you did bring

1970 up cigarette smoking?  What kind of reaction did you get?"

His answer was, "Not really, you know, she was just a smoker, you know, and that's the way I am." And so Ms. Cooper, even when her significant other would bring up smoking, she would just say, hey, that's the way I am.

A.    Sure.

Q.    And he knew that he shouldn't tell her to quit because she'd run him off.

A.    At one point when he was asked that. There's a lot of other stuff that he testifies to about her efforts to quit.

Q.    But when you took your notes and when you reviewed what was significant from the man who's known her for 25 years, you didn't even put in your notes that he said she liked smoking and she would run him off if he had ever told her to quit.

A.    No.  It wasn't really a debate as to whether she liked smoking.

Q.    So there's no question in your mind she liked smoking.

A.    Most smokers do.  If you're addicted to it you get the effects of the drug.

Q.    And so she enjoyed it.

Q.    But ready to be used when she would smoking again.

A.    Yep.

1972 One Lounge at a place that she described as extremely smoky.  Everybody was smoking and drinking.

A.    Sure.

Q.    And you saw that when she talked or was examined by the psychiatrist they discussed the fact that it's pretty hard to mount a quit-smoking effort in that kind of environment, right?

A.    Sure.

Q. Because if you're around cigarettes every day and everybody is smoking there it's going to be tough to go more than an hour without quitting.

A.    Very tough to overcome an addictive product like cigarettes.

Q. Now, she never tried to change her routine in some new way, as you recommend in your Smart Move pamphlet, did she?

A. No, she didn't. She tried to cut back on her cigarettes.

Q.    Well, I'm talking apart from her cigarettes.

so you don't have those cues, right?

you can
	think of that she did to change her routine?
	
A.
	
	Sure.  She used gum.  Nicorette Gum.

Q.
	
	Well, we've talked about those.  Those are

her act

	L quitting attempts, correct, gum, patches and

cold turk(

A.
	
	They were all quitting attempts, yeah.

obvious
	iy
	didn't quit working in an environment that

was smo

	at all times, correct?

A.
	
	That's right.

Q.
	
	She says that she worked 70 to 80 hours a

week in
	that environment, correct?
	
A.
	
	True.

Q.
	
	She said that she would work 12 to 14 hours

a day a
	t -
	the Take One Lounge, right?

A.
	
	Yep.

Q.
	
	She said she'd open up the lounge in the

morning
	or the early afternoon, right?
	
A.
	
	Right.

Q.
	
	And then she said she would always close it

down.
	
	

A.
	
	That's right.

Q.
	
	So she always there late at night.

1974 Q.    What time did Nightline come on?  Was that a show late at night, or was that early in the evening? A.    It would usually come on at 11:30. Q.    So the TV show that you showed with

would come on at 11:30 at night.

A.    That's right.

Q.    When she'd be at the lounge.

A.    Not always.  She described the fact that she would come home to take care of the kids, the grandkids and then go back to the lounge to close it up.

Q.    At no time did she say � at no time did she think about leaving that job to quit, right?

A.    She did.  She left the lounge eventually and went to work for Mr. Aarons.

Q. Right. And during the time that Mr. Aaron knew her, from the mid '80s on, he was asking her to quit the lounge and come work for him.

A.    Yeah.

Q.    Right?

And you say that she was actually trying to quit in the mid '80s, right?

A.    That's what she said, yes.

Q. And you agree that it was very hard to try to quit when you work at a place that's nonstop

1975 smoking.

A.    Well, that wouldn't be the really hard factor.  It's the fact that the product was engineered to make it hard to quit.

Q.    And it's harder to quit if you work at a job where it's nonstop smoking.

A.    If you've got an addictive product, yeah.

Q.    And her fiance was saying, please, stop working there and come work for me.

A.    That was later in the '80s, but, yeah, he was encouraging her to leave because it was somewhat of a dangerous environment.

Q.    Now, there's no evidence that she ever announced a quit date, as you mentioned in your stop-smoking handbook or your brochure; is that right?

A.    That's true.  Other than the day that she had her larynx out.

Q.    And obviously she never went to Smoke Enders or any stop-smoking meeting or a clinic or anything like you ran.

A.    No.

Q.    Now, when she used nicotine gum, she said she wasn't sure whether she got it with a prescription or not, right?

A.    That's right.

A.    Well, it would have been in the '80s is my understanding, so there are no medical records that date back that far.

Q.    And she said that she continued to smoke while chewing the gum.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And that she would smoke and chew the gum at the same time for at least a while.

A.    That's right, one to two weeks, I believe.

Q. And that wasn't the recommended use of the gum. You were not supposed to both chew the gum and smoke at the same time.

A.    No.  You're supposed to use the gum when you quit and use the gum as a replacement for the cigarettes.  But most people do exactly what she does.

Q.    And in the 1980s the gum itself had warnings that said, don't smoke while chewing the gum.

A.    Still do.

Q.    But she did that any way.

A.    Yep.

Q.    And she said that she actually read the instructions, so she knew that you weren't supposed to smoke and chew the gum at the same time.

A.    Sure.

Q.    But she did it any way.

A.    She cut back on her smoking at that time.

Q.    And when she was asked, how long did you stop, if at all, when you were chewing the gum, she said a few hours.

A.    That's right.

Q.    Now, patches.  She said under oath in her deposition that she used patches in the 1980s, right?

A.    She did.  I think she also, I think,

Q.    I mean, it couldn't have happened in the 1980s, right?

A.    Could not have.

Q.    Because you told us that patches did not come out until the 1990s, right?

A.    '92.

Q.    '92.

And there is no record of any doctor prescribing her patches in all those 1990s records, right?

A.    No.  I think the records start in '90 � let

96.

197 prescription at any time.

A. No. But if you use the patch or the gum in that time period you'd have to have it as prescription.

Q. You told the jury that in 1996 patches went over-the-counter so anybody could go into a drugstore and buy those patches, right?

A.    That's right.  Except for minors.  They don't sell them to people under age.

Q.    And so when we looked at the 1996 medical records, '97 and from then on, none of those records say, smoked for 30 years, tried to quit with patches.

A.    No.

Q.    And if she ever told a doctor that that had happened, that she'd actually used patches, they didn't record it.

A.    True.  Rare to see that recorded, unless the person was actually prescribing it.

Q.    Now, like the gum, Ms. Cooper would wear the patch and smoke at the same time on occasions.

A.    She said yes.

Q.    And like the gum, the instructions on the box of nicotine patches say don't do that.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And if you're trying to quit you have to wear the patch and not smoke, and if you're going to do

both you
	can't wear the patch.

A.
	Yeah.  Well, you can.  And many people do.

But the instructions are to try to stop smoking and
	
then use
	the patch.

Q.
	And Ms. Cooper said that she actually read

1980 smoke at the same time.

"Answer:  Yes."

So she did read the instructions.  She did understand them.  And she didn't follow them. A.    Sure.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, for context was ask that the preceding line 5 through 10 be read. THE COURT:  Mr. Belasic.

MR. BELASIC:  So 268, line 5, "And at the time that you decided to use the patch, what caused you to try the patch?  What was the reason for trying to stop smoking at that time?"

And she said, "I don't know what reason I had.  I just wanted to stop." BY MR. BELASIC:

Q. So when you were weighing the testimony and determining whether the information was accurate, did you think that someone who tried � who was using patches in the 1990s after everything that we've seen and you agreed to in the '80s, she really didn't know why she was trying to quit?

A.    She wanted to stop smoking and that was important and she was making efforts to quit.  And she was struggling to do so.  And so � and was using a

1981 to nicotine.  So all that information was relevant to

Q.    And my question to you, sir, was different. Did you believe it was accurate when she said that even in the 1990s she said under oath, I don't remember, I don't know why I was trying to quit?

A.    At that time, yeah, I think it's � you know, people quit for different reasons at different times.

Q.    So in the early 1980s she's telling her daughter not to smoke because it's too dangerous and it's bad for her.

A.    Uh-huh.

Q.    In the 1980s telling the dancers to quit for the same reason.  In 1984 her father dies of lung cancer; she tries to quit smoking.  And in the 1990s she's telling her grandkids not to smoke.

I mean, let's be reasonable.  Don't you think that she was trying to quit or was using patches because obviously she knew smoking was bad for her?

A.    I would agree that over time she probably is getting more awareness of the health risks of smoking and she is trying to quit.  And continued use of an addictive substance is a hallmark of addiction.  It's one of the criteria that I used in assessing whether

Q.     And she told you in the phone interview that she tried to quit, in fact, in the early '80s; is that correct?

A.    She said in the '80s and '90s.

Q.    Now, that Nightline show with Mr. Horrigan, that was 1984, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    So that's a couple of years after she's telling her daughter not to smoke because it's bad for her, right?

A.    Well, we don't know exactly when she told her daughter.  I mean, you've written these dates down as if they're locked in stone.  We just know that when her daughter was young there's a recollection she told her daughter not to smoke.

Q.    Well, let's go back, because I thought we had an agreement.  She testified under oath that she caught her daughter smoking when her daughter was 12 or 13.  We went over that, right?

A.    Right.

Q.    And her daughter was born in 1970, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    So I'm not making this up, right, this is from Ms. Cooper's testimony?

A.    Sure.

Q.    Okay.

A.    She told her daughter not to smoke.

Q.    Now, if you could look at page 7 of your notes.

Q.    So you put in your notes that Ms. Cooper said under oath she had a knot in her neck in 1995, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And she said under oath they told me that it was cancer.  You wrote that down, right?

Q.    And you and I have already discussed she said under oath that after Dr. Shapiro told her to quit she said she would try but on that occasion she did not even try.

A.    That's what she said.

Q.    So the way she tells it is she had a surgery in '95 for the knot in her neck, right?

A.    Biopsy.

MR. BASS:  Objection, asked and answered, Judge.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    And then after that surgery she had surgery to remove the benign polyps on her neck.

A.    Right.  She was having symptoms of what eventually became her cancer.  The first of which was in '95.

Q.    Dr. Cummings, earlier this morning I had asked you, we had talked about 1970 when she was pregnant with her daughter Mechelle you said � I asked you, did she have the ability to quit in 1970?  You said yes.  Is that right?

BY MR. BELASIC
		
	

Q.
	So 1
	et's talk about addiction and some of
	
the even
	ts in
	her life.  You told us that when
	she

switched
	to li
	ghts for the first time it was 1995,
	
right?
	
	
	

A.
	Yes.
	
	

Q.
	And
	that's because her daughter Meche
	slle

says she
	went
	to the store to buy cigarettes for her
	
mom, correct?
		
	

A.
	That
	's right.
	

Q.
	And
	her daughter Mechelle would ofter
	i buy

cigarett
	es for
	her mother, correct?
	

A.
	That
	' s right.
	

Q.
	And
	she went to the store to buy her
	her

regular
	brand,
	which was at that time Marlboro
	menthol

100s.
	
	
	

A.
	Correct.
		

Q.
	And
	they were out and so instead she
	bought

a substi
	tute,
	Marlboro menthol lights 100s.
	

A.
	Yeah
	, which she thought were safer.
	

Q.
	And
	so at that time that was the firs
	t time

she had
	ever smoked Marlboro menthol lights, ir
		i 1995,

right?
	
	
	

A.
	That
	's what she said, yes.

Q.    And it's because her daughter brought them home because they ran out of the other kind at the store.

So did Ms. Cooper have the ability to quit smoking in 1995 when she was smoking those lights?

A.    Certainly she had the ability to make a quit attempt.

Q.    Well, that's not what I asked.

A.    Well, sure.

Q.    Just so the record �

A.    Everybody has the ability to quit.  Some people don't succeed in quitting because they're very heavily addicted.  She didn't succeed until she had her voice box removed.

Q.    So I think that's beyond my question.  My question is simply, in 1995 when she started smoking lights she had the ability to quit; is that right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    So I'm going to put yes.

You told Mr. Bass that her addiction was a cause of her larynx cancer.  I'm going to ask you some questions about the basis for your opinion.

A.    Sure.

Q.    If she had the ability to quit, if

25 Ms. Cooper quit smoking in 1995 instead of switching to

12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1989 lights, would addiction still be the cause of her cancer?

A.    Sure, you'd still be addicted.  In fact, she was addicted even after she stopped smoking and, you know.  So, yes, once addicted, you're always addicted.

6 |And you're always at risk of relapse.  It's just a bout

7 of remission versus relapse, just like cancer. Q.    I'm asking you the basis for your opinion

9 When you say addiction was the cause of her cancer � A.    Sure.

Q.    � if she quits in 1995, would she still get cancer?

A.    She may, yes.

Q.    I'm putting "If she quits does she still get

cancer?"

If she quits in 1995, that's one year before the time she has to prove that it developed, right?

A.    Sure.  She was already having symptoms in 1995 of the disease that eventually was diagnosed as laryngeal cancer.

Q.    So the answer is, it's one year before, even if she quits in 1995 she's still going to get larynx cancer from prior smoking.

A.    She may have, yes.  I can't say absolutely 100 percent.  And I don't think anybody can.

1990

Q. Well, let me ask it a different way. Can you say that it is more likely than not that if she quit smoking in '95 she would avoid getting her cancer?

A.    I can't say that.

Q.    Now, you didn't see any evidence that there was any quit attempts in the early 1990s, did you?

A.    She said she quit in the '80s and '90s.  It wasn't specific to 1991, '92, '93.  I don't think anybody went through and asked her those questions.  So I can't answer those questions.

Q.    Well, let's talk about a specific date then, 1985.  Well, let me ask you about the early 1990s.

She said that she's warning her grandchildren not to smoke because it's bad for their health in the '90s.

A.    Sure.

Q.    So let's say that was the early 1990s.  Did she have the ability to quit in the early 1990s?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And if she had quit, if instead of telling her grandchildren she had quit in the early 1990s, is it more likely than not that she wouldn't get cancer, avoids getting cancer?

A.    I can't say more likely than not.  It would be less likely.  The sooner you quit, the less likely

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=783
4 manifests as a diagnosis.  And, you know, it's not like

5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1991 you are to get the disease.  But the disease is related to the dose of exposure.  And cancer is a disease that often goes undiagnosed for a number of years before it

today you don't have cancer and tomorrow you do and you know it.  Most people it goes on for years.  And she was already having symptoms in '95, so that's why I mentioned I couldn't answer yes a hundred percent in '95 had she quit would she avoid the disease.  I think probably less likely she would have avoided it even quitting in '95 because you already had some evidence.

Q.    And that's why I'm asking you a different question, and let me be very clear.  If she quit in the early 1990s is it more likely than not that she would have avoided getting cancer?

A.    I can't say.  I don't know the answer to that.  It would be more likely than had she continued.

Q.    Well, that's not the question.

A.    But I can't give you an answer.  So I don't know.  The answer is I don't know.

Q.    You can't tell this jury she quits in the '90s, she's cancer free and she doesn't have to bring a lawsuit.  You can't tell the jury that.

A.    I can't.

Q.    Okay.  Now, what about 1985 when the

warnings, the rotating warnings come on the pack, right?  Those warnings included cancer, heart disease, emphysema, et cetera, right?

A.    Yeah.

Q.    Those warnings came out �

A.    Not et cetera.  They were very specific diseases that were mentioned.

Q.    I didn't mean any lack of respect to the warnings, but it said those three diseases, right?

A.    Right.  Not laryngeal cancer.

MR. BELASIC:  Move to strike, Your Honor, on preemption.

THE COURT:  Nonresponsive.  Sustained. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    And those warnings in '85, they were right after her father died of lung cancer, right?

A.    True.

Q.    And even if she thought her father died of heart disease the warning on her pack said smoking caused heart disease.

A.    True.

Q.    So same question.  You talk about addiction causing her cancer.  If she would have quit when the warnings came out in January 1985 can you tell this jury she wouldn't get cancer?

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=785
25

1993

1     A.    More likely than not I would say yes at that

2 point.

3     Q.    So I just want to be clear, if she quits in

4 1985 you say it is more likely than not that she would

5 avoid getting cancer.

6     A.    Yes.  I can tell you why if you'd like to

7 know.

8     Q.    And I'm going to put, "yes, avoids cancer

9 more likely than not," right?

10     A.    Yep.

11     Q.    Okay.  Now, in 1984 when her father dies and

12 Robert Aaron says it really impacts her, right?  If she

13 quit smoking then would she avoid getting her cancer?

14     A.    Well, the death of her father impacted her

15 because it was the death of her father, not because it

16 was lung cancer.

17     Q.    If she had quit smoking following the death

18 of her father from lung cancer in '84 would she avoid

19 getting cancer?

20     A.    I can't say 100 percent that she would avoid

21 getting cancer, because it's a dose response and she

22 had a number of years of exposure that had accumulated

23 up to that point, but the reason I answered it would be

24 more likely than not is the epidemiology tells us that

the sooner you quit the less likely you are to go on

years. I think she might have avoided her disease, but I can't say hundred percent. I'm not that confident in it. Because she already had a fair amount of exposure, even up to 1985. And the disease can have a long latency, which means you can have cancer cells floating around in your body and you eventually get the disease diagnosed, and it could be 10, 15 years down the line.

Q.    Okay, Dr. Cummings.  I just want to make sure I get your opinion down right.

A.    Sure.

Q.    You said if she quit in '85 with the warnings, yes, she avoids cancer more likely than not. Is that the same answer if she quits in '84, yes, she would avoid her cancer more likely than not?

A.    Sure.  Given the context that I just gave.

Q.    So I've done 1985 and 1984.  I assume the answer is the same for any time before then; if she had quit smoking before 1985 you think it's more likely than not she avoids getting cancer.

A.    Right.  Had she never smoked clearly she wouldn't have gotten laryngeal cancer.

Q.    Well, for example, in 1982 and 1983 when she

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=787
6 more likely than not she doesn't get cancer, right?

7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

1995 told her daughter to quit, she said, don't be like me, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    So if instead of telling her daughter don't be like me she had actually quit smoking, you believe

A.    If she had been able to quit, yeah.

Q.    Now, I asked you if she had the ability to quit in '95.  And in 1990 � did she have the ability to quit in '85?

A.    She had the ability to make a quit attempt, whether you can sustain it is a whole nother matter.

Q.    Again, my question is, did she have the ability to quit, not just try, in 1985?

A. Well, what we know is that she was trying to quit in that period of time and she didn't succeed, so that's what we know.

Q.    That's not my question, sir.

A.    That's all I can answer.  Sorry.

Q. Well, you told me she did have the ability to quit in '95. Did she have the ability to quit 10 years earlier?

A.    Yeah, ability to make a quit attempt, sure. She was making quit attempts.

1996 for �

A.    We are.

Q.    � further down.

Can you say yes or no that she had the ability to quit at any time in the '90s or '80s?  I'm not asking you about a quit attempt.

MR. BASS:  Judge, I think it's asked and answered.

THE COURT:  I overrule the objection. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    Let's start over and let's be real clear.

You understand there's a difference between

13 making a quit effort, whether it is one hour or 24

hours, and actually stopping. A.    Sure. Q.    And what I'm asking is the second part.  Did

17 Mary Cooper have the ability to quit smoking in 1995?

A.    The evidence is that she struggled to sustain staying off.  That's all I can say.

Q.    You can't answer that yes or no?

A.    I can't answer that yes or no because the evidence is that she struggled to sustain staying off, and that's what the evidence shows in this case, because of her addiction.

Q.    So I've got to cross out "yes" because you

1997 can't say that she even had the ability to quit in 1995; is that right?

A.    I guess you do because I was talking about the ability to make a quit attempt and I was answering � I thought that's what you were asking me.

Q.    And your answer is you can't say yes or no for the ability to quit smoking.

A.    I can't.  I don't know.  I mean, she basically was making efforts to try to stop smoking and was unsuccessful.

Q.    So the early 1990s, is it also true you can't say yes or no whether she even had the ability to quit smoking; is that right?

A.    I wouldn't � the ability to sustain staying off cigarettes, the evidence is that she struggled to do that and was unsuccessful.

Q.    So your answer is you can't say yes or no.

A.    The evidence is that she did not.

Q.    If you can answer my question, sir, we could

20 move it along

A.    Sure.

Q.    Can you say yes or no whether Ms. Cooper had the ability to quit smoking in the early 1990s?

A.    Based on my review of the evidence, no. Q.    Now, let's go back to the '80s, and

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=790
21 22

24 25

199

1 obviously she's been smoking for 10 years less by '85.

2     A.    That's right.

3     Q.    So in 1985 she's been a regular smoker for

4 like 20 years, right, or a little less?

5     A.    That's right.

6     Q.    You're the expert on addiction for

7 Ms. Cooper in this case.  Did she have the ability to

8 quit smoking in 1985 after less than 20 years of

9 smoking?

10     A.    We don't know.  Because she hadn't really

11 been trying to quit until the middle of the 1980s.

12     Q.    And let me go back to 1982 when she �

13  '82/'83, take both those years, when she's telling her

14 daughter to quit.

15     A.    Right.

16     Q.    At that point she's been a regular smoker

17 for, what, 16 years, something like that?

18     A.    That's right.

19     Q.    In 1982/'83 after 16 years of smoking, did

20 Mary Cooper have the ability to quit smoking?

A.    To sustain a quit attempt, I think she was heavily addicted at that point.  And she started to

23 make quit attempts at that point and was unsuccessful.

So the evidence is she did not.

Q.    So I should put "did not."

6       him on all cases.

7           We just ask that the jury be instructed that

8       they disregard.  It's totally improper, improper

9       accreditation.

10           THE COURT:  All you're doing at this stage,

11       sir, is calling extra attention to something.

12       It wasn't objected to at the time

13       contemporaneously.  I think you just call

14       extraordinary attention to it when you ask me to

15       do something like that.

16           MR. DAVIS:  You're probably right about

22           MR. PEDROSA:  I would just ask that it be

23       stricken, nobody is going to talk about it in

24       closing or anything like that, but not an

25       instruction.

2001 THE COURT:  Your objections are all denied. Okay.  Are we ready? Bring the jury in.

(Jury entered the courtroom at 2:48 p.m.) THE COURT:  We're all set, folks.  Thanks much.  Have a seat.  Welcome back, everybody. Still on cross. Mr. Belasic. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, I'd like to switch gears and talk about advertising. A.    Sure.

Q.    And you said you have a huge collection of cigarette advertisements.

A.    Well, I don't know if it's huge, but it's about 10,000 different print ads and about 800 or so TV and radio ads.

Q.    And in this case because of all the information from her sworn deposition testimony, your interview with her where you asked her, you knew the brands that she smoked in advance of coming to trial, right?

A.    True.

Q.    And who picked out the advertisements that you showed the jury?  Was it you, or was it the

2002 attorneys?

A.    The Belair ad?  I did.

Q.    I don't mean just the Belair ad.  Did you pick out all that ads?

A.    Fred Flintstones and Beverly Hillbillies, I picked those out because those were � she mentioned in her deposition.

Q.    Did the lawyers pick out ads as well?

A.    No.  I mean, I've used some of the collages in other trials of ads because they have the different themes that I described.

Q.    Okay.  So in coming into this case you knew that she did not smoke in the 1950s or obviously in the '40s before she was born, right?

A.    True, obviously.

Q.    And you know that she smoked filtered and not unfiltered.

A.    True.

Q.    And you know she smoked menthol and not nonmenthol.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And you knew what brands she smoked and you knew those brands did not include Lucky Strike, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And yet the very first ad you put up to show

2003 this jury was a Lucky Strike from the 1950s that was unfiltered and it wasn't menthol.  That's what you chose to do, right?

A.    It was part of the collage, yes.

Q.    No, it was the first big ad.  Remember, Lucky Strike, the first ad was a woman in a bikini, 1950s bikini.  That was the first big print ad that you put up on the screen, right?

A.    It was part of a collage, and I think the upper left was a Lucky Strike ad.  And that got blown up.  I don't control the blow up of which one they picked out, but...

Q.    So you're saying it's the lawyers that picked out the ad for a brand she never smoked at a time when she didn't smoke.

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative. THE WITNESS:  No, sir � THE COURT:  Sustained.  Let's move on. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    Then you showed an ad from Belair in the 1950s, correct?

A.    1960s.

Q.    And Belair, she started with Belair because that was the cigarette that her dad smoked.

A.    That's right.

A.    That's the story, yes.

Q.    Right?  Well, it's not the story, it's the truth, right?

A.    That's the evidence as I know it.

Q.    You believe her when she says that she got a cigarette from her brother who took it from her dad's pack, right?

A.    Yes, I do.

Q.    And it was � the Belair ad, that was the one where it's a beach and there's a beautiful lady swinging in a hammock and then some guy with the chest hair comes walking up.  That's what I remember, right?

A.    I remember the breath easy, yes.

Q.    And the reason Ms. Cooper started smoking Belair is because her brother John, in her own words, encouraged her to smoke, not because of a lady in a hammock or a big chesty guy.

A.    First started smoking, that's true.

Q.    And during the three days that she testified under oath, she never once said that she ever saw an ad for Belair, right?

A.    No.  Not sure she said that, was asked that question.

2005 Q.    You don't remember, based on your review and

all the time you spent in preparing, that she ever said under oath that she ever saw a single ad for Belair; is that right?

A.    True.

Q.    If she says it here in court in this trial it will be the first time, right?

A.    Sure.  Of course she did see an ad because she bought Belair packs, that was part of the advertising.

Q. Then one of the collages, and by collages I assume you're referring to where they put up about 20 ads at a time.

A.    Yeah, I collected a variety of ads under different themes.

Q.    And one of the collages was titled "Health Care Professionals."  It had things like, "More doctors smoke Camels."

A.    That's right.

Q.    And those ads were from before she started smoking, correct?

A.    True.

Q.    In particular, the "More doctors smoke Camels" was from the '50s or even the 1940s, correct?

A.    Late '40s, early '50s.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And the TV clip you showed you said was from 1949 to 1951, and that was again about Camel doctors, right?

A.    The ad was from '49.  The campaign I believe ran from '48 to '51.

Q.    We know she was born in 1951, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    So in 1949 she was negative 2, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Hadn't been born yet.

A.    Hadn't been born.

Q.    You showed the jury some ads about inhalation, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And the ad that you've picked was for Philip Morris, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And the brand that was depicted there that was manufactured by Philip Morris is not a brand that she ever smoked, correct?

A.    That's true.

Q.    There was some guy, a voiceover talking to a woman, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And the Philip Morris "Do you inhale?" ad was from the 1940s.

A.    Yes, it was.

Q.    It was before she was ever born.

A.    True.

Q.    Then you showed a collage of filter ads, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    I remember, you'll correct me if I'm wrong, I remember two that you blew up on the screen so the jury could focus.  One was the Viceroy filter trap and the other was the Kent Micronite filter.

A.    That's right.

Q.    Ms. Cooper never smoked Viceroy filter trap cigarettes.

A.    No.

Q.    She never smoked Viceroy filters at all.

A.    As far as I know, she did not.

Q.    Never smoked any form of Viceroys, filtered, unfiltered, lights.

A.    As far as I know, she didn't smoke Viceroy.

Q. And the second filter ad that you focused on was Kent Micronite. And I remember you said Micronite was just a silly made-up word.

A.    That's right.

Q.    She never smoked Kent Micronite filters.

A.    No.

Q.    At any time.

A.    No.  Those were selected because they were the two first filtered products in the '50s.

Q. The very first cigarette that she smoked had a filter on it, right?

A.    Yes, it did.

Q.    And she continued to smoke filters throughout her life, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And every single brand that she regularly smoked was filtered, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    So she wasn't a smoker who started out in the 1940s smoking unfiltered, the short cigarettes, and then switched to a filter.  She was always smoking filters.

A.    She started with the filter and stuck with the filtered cigarette.

Q.    So she wasn't someone who in the 1940s was smoking a filter and saw an ad and thought, well, maybe they're safer, I better switch.  That's not Ms. Cooper, right?

A.    I don't think they had many filtered cigarettes in the 1940s.

Q.    Well, she wasn't the type of person that started smoking unfiltered in the '40s and then switched in the '50s because some ad made her think it was safer, right?  She was always filter.

A.    True.

Q.    And she never sat down and had some heart-to-heart, you know, I better switch to unfiltered, right?  She never did that.

A.    No.

Q.    Now, in America, what, hundreds of millions of people probably over the last 50, 60 years have seen advertisements for cigarettes, right?

A.    Yes, virtually everybody.

Q.    And so pick a number, but tens of millions, a couple hundred million, people have seen those ads and they've never gone on to smoke.

A.    True.  There's some people that have never gone on to smoke.

Q.    You ever smoke in your life?

A.    No, it doesn't.

Q.    And just because a person smokes a particular brand of cigarettes and says, I saw some ads, that doesn't mean that they chose that brand because the advertising made them, right?

A.    Most people can't � don't recognize the effect of advertising, but certainly the selection of a brand is the direct result of consumer advertising. That's why they do advertising, as is stated in the business records of your client and others.

Q.    Right.  So your testimony then is that everybody that smokes a particular brand of cigarettes, they smoke that brand because of an ad.

A.    They say that consumer advertising is the factor that gets you to select that particular brand versus some other product, yeah.

Q.    Well, let's see with Ms. Cooper.  She obviously didn't smoke Belair because of an ad.  We know she smoked it because that was her dad's cigarette and brother John gave it to her.

A.    Well, we don't know whether the advertising had an effect.  There are a lot of factors that can influence the particular brand selection, but certainly the advertising for that product and that particular brand is one of the factors.

2012 Q.    In Ms. Cooper, that's what you're telling the jury?

A.    Yes, in Ms. Cooper.

Q.    So the brand that you admit she never even claims to have seen advertising for, you're going to tell the jury that it caused her to smoke Belair when her brother gave her that cigarette? A.    It just didn't drop �

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative. THE COURT:  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, it didn't drop out of the sky.  Her father selected that brand probably because of the advertising for that brand. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    So now you're saying her dad, now you're going to claim her dad smoked Belairs because of ads. MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative. THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  Yes. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    And you have no earthly idea why he smoked, right?  He's dead and he couldn't testify.

A.    The evidence is that he was addicted, that's why he smoked.

Q.    We're talking about advertising,

2013 Dr. Cummings.  You understand that, right? A.    Yes, we are. Q.    You have no evidence whatsoever why

right?

A.    The evidence comes from the business records of the company, and they say every customer is pre-sold and the brands that they select is a direct result of consumer marketing.  That's what it says.

Q.    And yet when we asked Ms. Cooper, why did you smoke that first Belair, she says, it's because my brother John encouraged me to smoke, right?

A.    I don't think she was asked, why did you smoke that first Belair?  I think it was, where did you get the first cigarette?  And she acknowledged she got it from her brother, as many young people do.

Q. And no matter what the brand was, it was going to be the brand her dad smoked, because they stole the cigarettes from their dad, right?

A.    Sure, that's right.

Q.    But you still think it's the Belair ad that you know she doesn't even claim she saw; that's what you're telling us, the invisible ad.

A.    Well, she went on � she got the cigarettes from her brother.  They happened to be Belair.  They

5 marketing.  When you put your money down on the counter

6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

2014 could have been any other brand, but they were Belair. But when she first bought her cigarettes, the first usual brand of cigarettes that she reported buying, they were Belair.  And that's the direct result of

for it, you're influenced by advertising.  Now, it may not be the only influence, but it's certainly a factor.

Q.    And of course she wasn't putting her money down.  Her brother John was taking the cigarettes from her father.

A.    She was putting her money down, so the answer would be no.  She was smoking � started out getting the cigarettes stolen from her father, and as you reported, and we talked about earlier, when she started buying her cigarettes from her grandmother's general store, she'd leave the money, she bought the Belairs.  She could have bought any other brand that they were selling there.  She selected the Belairs.

Q.    Instead she smoked the first cigarette she got from her dad and her brother.

A.    Yeah.

Q.    Now, let's ask a different question.  When it comes to starting to smoke, picking up that very first cigarette, isn't it true that the most important factor is whether the smoker's friends and family

smoke?
	

A.
	Sure.

Q.
	And so in this case that most important

factor
	, let's look at the friends and family.  We don't

know a
	bout her friends, right?

A.
	We don't.

Q.
	Her family, dad smoked.  It was his

cigare
	ttes .

A.
	That's the story, yes.

Q.
	Her family, brother John smoked.  He says he

encouraged her to go out in the woods and smoke that
	
first
	cigarette, right?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Family, grandmother sold cigarettes, right?

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	She could go in there and take cigarettes,

apparently leave a quarter and her grandmother wouldn't
	
say an
	ything to her, right?

A.
	Any brand she wanted.  She chose Belair.

Q.
	Because her dad smoked it.

A.
	She chose Belair.

Q.
	She actually told us that the � isn't it

true,
	she actually said that the reason she smoked

mentho
	Is is because that's what her dad smoked?

A.
	Yeah.

Q.    Not ads, she said, that's what my dad smoked.

A.    She started smoking those cigarettes, yeah.

Q.    And when asked, why did you smoke filtered, she said she smoked filtered because that's what her father smoked, right?

A.    Well, among other things.  She did talk about the fact that she saw lots of ads for filtered cigarettes and that she thought they were safer.

Q.    Well, let's look at Mary Cooper volume 3 page 546 .

A.    Sure.

Q.    And you told me you didn't think there was anything in there that was inaccurate and you weighed it.

"Answer:  Yes." Then continuing.

"The Belair was filtered, true? "Yes.

"And you smoked the filter, again, because that's what your father smoked � "Answer:  Yes. "� right?"

Now, she told you that she also did see filter ads along the way, but the reason she smoked filters from the very beginning was because that's what dad smoked, right?

A.    I'll let the testimony stand in its entirety.

Q.    Okay.  When we asked her, why did you switch to Salem, she said, she didn't remember whether she had seen it on TV or whether somebody had given it to her and she liked it. A.    Yes.

Q.    All right.  So she didn't know at least when we asked her under oath. A.    That's right.

Q.    And then she smoked Newports.  And when we asked her, why did you smoke Newports, she said � we asked her, "You just don't know what caused you to smoke Newports?"  She said no, that she didn't know what caused her to smoke Newports.

A.    That's right, didn't recall.

Q.    And do you remember that she said she must have liked the taste of Newports better than the taste of Winston menthols?

A.    Yes.  Of course the Winston menthols also were withdrawn from the market.

1 advertisement was from 1960, correct?

2     A.    Correct, '60 and '61 I believe is when they

3 sponsored the Flintstones.

4     Q.    Ms. Cooper was not smoking when that ad ran.

5     A.    No.

8     Q.    Now, the Flintstones wasn't a Saturday

9 morning cartoon in 1960 or '61, right?

10     A.    No, it was prime time.

11     Q.    And you didn't mean to suggest that that was

12 some Saturday morning cartoon.  In fact, in the '60s it

13 was prime time, right?

14     A.    I think I was very clear.  I said it was a

15 prime time show and when it went to Saturday morning

16 syndication sponsorship was withdrawn.

they ran the ad saying, America's first adult cartoon comedy, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And then here's the New York Times advertising the premier, and it says, "The first, the freshest, the funniest comedy of its kind, an adult comedy in cartoon form."

You agree with me that the coverage said that they were trying to take off on The Honeymooners. A.    Yeah, I think that's referred to elsewhere. MR. BASS:  And, Judge, I would just ask for completeness if we could show the box above Flintstones.

THE COURT:  Show the whole thing.

Q.    If we could go back to the Flintstones.  And then the Flintstones was running at 8:30 p.m.  That's prime time, right?

A.    When it premiered it came out at 8:30 and then it went to 7:30.

Q.    Let's look what it was leading into.  It was leading into the '60s classic 77 Sunset Strip.  And that clearly was an adult show, right? A.    Sure.

Well, not really, but it had a substantial viewership of teenagers actually.  77 Sunset Strip would be accurate.

Q.    Now, there were two sponsors of the Flintstones when it premiered, correct?

A.    That's right, Alka-Seltzer and Winston. Q.    And Alka-Seltzer is a product for heartburn and indigestion.  We probably all know what that is. A.    Plop, plop, fizz, fizz.

Q.    It's not a kids' product.

A.    No.

Q.    You're trying to market to kids, you're probably not selling a lot of Alka-Seltzer, are you?

A.    I always thought it was pretty neat when you dropped it in and see the fizzing, but...

Q.    You've said that often, right, but you're the only person that says they bought Alka-Seltzer as a child, aren't you?

A.    I used it as a child.

Q.    Because I've heard it before.

That's funny, but you would agree that

13 Alka-Seltzer was an adult product.

A.    It was intended for adults, sure. Q.    The makers of Alka-Seltzer must have thought they were reaching adults through the Flintstones, the adult cartoon comedy.

MR. BASS:  Objection, speculation. THE WITNESS:  I don't think so. THE COURT:  Sustained the way it's phrased. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    Now, Reynolds and Winston only advertised on the Flintstones for one year, right?

A.    I think it went in '60 and '61, is my understanding, so that would be two years.

	Q.
	Now, it wasn't until many years later that

the
	Fl
	intstones became what probably most of us

rememb
		er, the Saturday morning Flintstones.


	A.
	Well, I remember the one in � I'm sorry,

I 'm
	th
	e age of Mary Cooper.  I grew up watching the

Flints
		tones with my parents at 7:30 in the evening.


	Q.
	Did you hear my question?


	A.
	You said most of us, and I'm just telling

you
	�
	I don't know about most of us, but I can tell you

about
		my self.


	Q.
	If you heard my question, my question was:

It wasn't until years later, years later that the show
		
moved
		to Saturday.  You understand the question?


	A.
	Sure .


	Q.
	So I'm asking you about the Saturday show.

You
	un
	derstand that, right?


	A.
	Sure .


	Q.
	Okay.  So years after that show it moved to

Sati
	ird
	ays, right?


	A.
	Correct.


	Q.
	And Winston, Reynolds, no tobacco company

adv(
	2rt
	ised on Saturdays.


	A.
	True.


	Q.
	So it ran two years at a time when

Ms.
	Cooper didn't smoke.

1     A.    Okay.  True they didn't advertise with the

2 Flintstones on Saturdays.  Untrue that they didn't

3 advertise on Saturdays.  They certainly did.

4     Q.    Right.  Saturday morning cartoons, nobody is

5 claiming that Winston was sponsoring Saturday morning

6 cartoons.

7     A.    True, on television.

8     Q.    Now, seeing Barney or Fred, that didn't make

9 Ms. Cooper the nonsmoker at age 9 or 10 run out and

10 smoke.

11     A.    No.

12     Q.    Right?

13           And even though, her brother was smoking at

14 that time, right?

15     A.    That's right.

16     Q.    And the reason that she ended up smoking in

17 19 whatever it was, at age 12 at '63 or age 11, the

18 reason that she chose that particular time is because

19 that's the day her brother offered her cigarettes,

20 right?

21     A.    No, the reason was, and she said that it was

22 cool, it was a way to be adult, and so, you know, it

23 was normalized.  And, yeah, she got the cigarettes from

24 her brother.

2027 Didn't she say under oath the reason that she smoked the first cigarette was that her brother encouraged her to smoke?

MR. BASS:  Objection, asked and answered. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    Right?  Isn't that what she said?

A.    She did say that.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, objection is overruled. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    And the date that her brother encouraged her to smoke, that was up to her brother, right?  It didn't happen because she thought it was cool.  It happened because brother John offered her a cigarette.

A.    She did get the first cigarette with her brother John.  It's not from her father.

Q.    Now, other companies in the U.S. have and do use cartoon characters to advertise adult products, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    They use the Pink Panther to sell fiberglass insulation.

A.    That's right.

Q.    Fiberglass insulation, that's not a kids product.

Q.    They use the Snoopy character, Snoopy and the little bird Woodstock, they use them to sell

A.    That's right.

Q.    And we don't have kids � we don't have people that are under 18 going out and buying life insurance, right?

A.    No.

Q.    So they're using popular cartoons to advertise adult products.

A.    Sure.

Q.    Now, none of the ads you showed the jury had the word "safe" in them, right?

A.    True.

Q.    Isn't it true that the 1994 Surgeon General's Report said that health claims in advertising actually likely increased consumer awareness of the risks?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And that's the Surgeon General saying that the health claims in ads backfired; they actually increased awareness of risk.

A.    Well, they were speculating at that time.

Q.    I just want to make sure the jury knows;

2029 when we're talking about who was speculating, it was

the Surgeon General of the United States and his

committee that was writing a 1994 Surgeon General's

Report, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And you, Dr. Michael Cummings, you also worked on the 1994 Surgeon General's Report.

A.    Yes, I was contributor to that.

Q.    And you didn't say that conclusion was wrong or, hey, yank that out of there.

A.    Well, first of all, that was a conclusion of the report.  So you're taking that � the statement out of context.

Q.    And you didn't say, as part of your work, you didn't say, get that statement out of there.

A.    No, I think it's very likely.  In fact, I testified to the jury that the early filters advertising was affecting smoking behavior, that's why you saw with the introduction of Kent and Viceroy in 1952 there was a drop in cigarette sales that occurred in 1953.  I think I actually stated that, and I think that's what they were referring to.

MR. BELASIC:  Could I have the court reporter read back the question, Your Honor? THE COURT:  You may.

2030 (A portion of the record was read by the reporter.) BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    So my question wasn't about ads, smoking in the '50s, whatever.  My question was simply, did you tell the Surgeon General to get that statement, the statement I've talked to you about, out of the report?

A.    No, because I wasn't shown that statement. It was in the preface of the report.  It wasn't actually part of the main report.

Q.    Are you sure about that?

A.    Not absolutely.

Q.    It's not in the preface.  I'll just tell you.  It's not a big mistake, but it's not �

A.    But it's not a conclusion, that I do know.

Q.    Let's talk about movies.

A.    Okay.

Q.    We spent some time on movies yesterday.  One of things I remember is you showed some memos about everybody's favorite Sylvester Stallone, right, Rocky?

A.    Sure, Rocky IV I think it was.

Q.    The Italian stallion.

A.    Right.

Q.    And that Sylvester Stallone memo talked about five movies, right?  That's what you showed the

A.    That's right.

Q.    And same question again, did you pick those

the lawyers showed you for the first time?

A.    No, I had seen those documents.

Q.    And were you the one who decided to show those to the jury?

A.    Sure.

Q.    So you showed a Sylvester Stallone memo that talked about five movies where he was going to smoke, right?

A.    Where he was going to have product placements for Brown and Williamson products.

Q.    No, it said he was going to smoke, didn't it?  Isn't that what you told the jury?

A.    No, I think we showed the contract which listed the five movies and the placement for Brown and

19 Williamson products in those movies.

Q.    Let's look at Exhibit � could we put Exhibit 5020 up.

That's what you showed the jury, right? And you're claiming that happened, that Sylvester Stallone was actually paid to use Brown and Williamson products in five movies, right?

3           That actually never did happen, did it?

4     A.    No, it did

5     Q.    Really?  You have evidence that they

6 actually paid Sylvester Stallone.

7     A.    Yeah.  There's a document talking about the payments in the form of cash and gifts.

9     Q.    All right.  Well, let's just talk about the

10 Imovies then that you say he was in.  The very first

11 movie, the very first movie on your list of five � the

12 last one was Rocky IV, so we'll get to that

13           The very first movie, let's see,

14 Godfather III.  So what is your favorite Sylvester

15 Stallone scene from Godfather III?

16     A.    I don't know.  He was the producer of

17 Imovies

Q.          Sylvester Stallone produced Godfather III?

A.          I have no clue.

Q.          You haven't heard of Francis Ford Coppola?

A.          Sure.

Q.          The Godfather trilogy was widely regarded as

23 maybe the pinnacle of moviemaking in America, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And Sylvester Stallone was not in that movie

A.    He was not an actor in the movie, but I don't know whether he had an affiliation and according to the agreement between the company that did the product placement and listed those movies.  So I don't know the answer to that question. Q.    Do you like movies? A.    Yeah.

MR. BASS:  Objection, relevance. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    And you liked the Godfather trilogy. A.    Sure.

MR. BASS:  Objection, relevance. THE COURT:  Mr. Belasic, when it comes to objections, you are going a little fast. MR. BELASIC:  I'm sorry.

THE COURT:  Let me at least make a ruling. The question is, you're objecting to its relevance, whether he likes movies or watches movies?  Is that the question you object? MR. BASS:  Yes, sir, both of those

	him
	questions about that.

BY MR.
	BELASIC:
	
Q.
	
	Let's be specific.  Have you seen

Godfather
		III?

A.
	
	Yes.

Q.
	
	So when you came in and you showed the jury

these

Sylvester
		Stallone was not in that movie and he sure as

heck wasn
		't smoking a cigarette in that movie.

A.
	
	I knew he wasn't an actor in the movie.  He

ran a
	pro
	duction company and was involved as an

investor
		in movies.

Q.
	
	And is it your testimony � then we can

leave
	Godfather.  Is it your testimony under oath that
	
Sylvester
		Stallone produced Godfather III?

A.
	
	No.

Q.
	
	Okay.  So then the last movie you showed �

the last
		movie on the list was Rocky IV, right?

A.
	
	Yes.

Q.
	
	You've seen Rocky IV, right?

2     Q.    Ivan Drago is so pumped up on this communist

3 steroid program that he kills the beloved Apollo Creed.

4 Carl Weathers is dead in that movie because Ivan Drago

5 is such a killer, right?

6     A.    Sure.

7     Q.    And the whole point of the movie is that

8 Rocky is going to have to train like no other boxer

9 from a non-communist country has ever trained before.

10 And they show his training minute after minute in the

11 movie, right?

12     A.    Sure.

13     Q.    I mean, what Rocky does is he runs up some

14 Russian mountain with the KGB tailing after him and

15 screams out, Drago, like he's going to kill Drago,

16 right?

17     A.    Sure.

18     Q.    And he sure as heck isn't puffing on any

19 cigarettes at all during that entire movie. 2 0     A.    No.

21     Q.    If anything, if you're a kid or an adult or

22 an elderly person, if you watch that movie, if anything

24 like good Americans and not pumped up robots like the

25 Russian Drago, right?

Q.    Yeah, so you think his fat brother Paulie

that would have been attractive to people. MR. GDANSKI:  Wasn't his brother. MR. BELASIC:  Brother-in-law.  I forget my Rocky lore.  It's the brother-in-law. THE COURT:  Go ahead.

THE WITNESS:  I think there was cash and gifts exchanged to Sylvester Stallone for placement of Brown and Williamson products in movies. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    Right.  And when I'm asking you under oath about placement, you don't seem to know anything about it, right?

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative. THE COURT:  The way you phrase it I sustain it. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    What I'm asking you about that placement you can't tell the jury, right? A.    No. Q.    You're just telling us that Sylvester

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

6 Williamson products in the movies

7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

203: Stallone is either smoking or he's producing Godfather

III .

A.    Said he wasn't smoking, and there was no

evidence that said he would smoke cigarettes.  It says

that they would have product placements of Brown and

Q.    So just two minutes ago I showed you this document.  This is the document you showed the jury, 5020.  That says that Sylvester Stallone is going to use the products, right?

A.    It says, I will use the products, meaning product placement of Brown and Williamson products in no less than five feature films, and for that � Q.    "I will use the products."

A.    Well, my interpretation of "I will use the products" �

Q.    Is that someone else will.

MR. BASS:  Objection, Your Honor.  Can Dr. Cummings finish?

THE WITNESS:  Is a product placement which will be that the particular product of Brown and Williamson, whatever one of their brands they wish to have, will appear at some point in the movie like Reese's Pieces appeared in ET or Marlboro, as we showed, in Superman II.

Q.    Okay.  So you just mentioned Marlboro and Superman II.  And you remember you showed the jury that clip.  There's a lady on from the Tobacco Institute and they're grilling her, how come there's so many Marlboro pictures � how come Marlboro is in that movie, right?

A.    Thirteen times.

Q.    Okay.  Thirteen times.

And you didn't show any clip from Superman II, right?

A.    Did I show any clips from Superman II?

Q.    No, not from the actual movie.

A.    Well, actually I think it was part of the 20/20 series.

Q.    Right.  So what you showed was the lady from the Tobacco Institute being questioned about it on 20/20, but not actually any clips, right?

A.    No, I think we showed a clip of the actual scene, one of the scenes where they had a Marlboro truck that one of the characters had been thrown into by Superman and was crushed into the Marlboro truck, and no such thing as Marlboro trucks, cigarettes are delivered in old gray vans, not Marlboro trucks, that was a paid product placement.

Q.    So you know the Superman mythology, right?

Q.    Now, she's smoking Marlboros, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    So you're watching that as a kid, you know that Superman is dedicated to one thing, he's in love with that woman and he doesn't want her to smoke because she's going to get lung cancer.

A.    Among other things, yes.

Q.    But you didn't mention to the jury when you were introducing evidence about Superman that the movie actually has Superman use his powers to find out if she has lung cancer, right?

A.    No, I didn't mention that to the jury.  I

Philip Morris and the producer to have their product placed in that movie.

Q.    And we all just saw it.  When he determines with his, I guess x-ray vision, that she doesn't have lung cancer, he doesn't say, cool, keep on smoking; he says, not yet.  Right?

A.    Right.

Q.    So even if you look at that movie you know Superman is suggesting she's going to get lung cancer in the future, just doesn't have it.

A.    Well, he said, no, yeah.  I think she continued to smoke in the movie.

Q.    Just like Ms. Cooper continued to smoke when she was warned.  And even when her own doctor personalized the risks for her and she promised to try, she kept on smoking, right?

A.    Yes, just as your client reassured her that it was okay to keep smoking.

Q.    Let's put up PT 3400.

MR. BELASIC:  That's already been admitted by the plaintiffs, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Okay. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    And you recognize you showed the jury this document, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    From 1984.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And Ms. Cooper was 33 years old when this was written, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    She had already been smoking for, what, at least 15, 20 years?

A.    That's right.

Q.    So she wasn't a minor.  She wasn't a youth,

Q.    Well, I'm just going to say I don't remember you actually mentioning that yesterday, did you?

A.    I did, you might have missed it.

Q.    Well, I think I was paying attention, though.  Let's look at page, it's Bates page 8469.

Now, again you made a big deal out of the fact that this was a secret document, right?

A.    I didn't make a big deal.  It just has "secret" stamped on it.

Q.    So it's an advertising strategy for a company, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And when a company advertises they don't usually don't disseminate their advertising strategy to their competitors or the general public, right?

A.    True.

Q.    And most business organizations don't put their internal documents on the Web.  They don't put their board of directors meetings and send them to newspapers, right?  Most company business records are

A.    Right.

Q.    So just to be sure, though, this is what they were saying to each other in private, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    This wasn't something that they said, you know, I betcha 30 years later Dr. Cummings is going to come in so we better write it one way or the other. They were telling this to each other in private.

A.    What were they telling everyone in private?

Q.    Whatever they put in there, they didn't think this was going to be public.  They were telling each other this in private, right?

A.    Well, they did do some things which they told each other in private, such as using the term "young adult smoker" when they were referring to teenagers.

Q.    Well, let's see what they were referring to. You see that is says, "RJR's consistent policy is that smoking is a matter of free informed adult choice, which the company does not seek to influence.  However, in order to plan our business we must consider the effects that those choices may have on the future of the industry.  Furthermore, if we are to compete effectively, we must recognize the imperative to know

2045 and meet the wants of those who are 18 and have already elected to smoke as well as those of older smokers." Right?  Have I read that correctly?

A.    You did.

Q.    Can we look at page Roman numeral I, Tammy, under "Purpose"?

It starts of with the purpose.  It says, "The purpose of this document is intended to assist RJR in optimizing its strategic position with respect to younger adult smokers (18 to 24) by clarifying their importance versus smokers 25 plus.  Identifying strategies which have been most effective against younger adult smokers in the past and applying this learning to RJR and its current environment." Right?  Did I read that correctly?

A.    You did.

Q.    Now, you've testified about this document, this 1984 strategy many, many, many times, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And you know that this document defines younger adult smokers as those between the ages of 18 to 24 more than 200 times, right?

A.    That's true.

Q.    What brand was Ms. Cooper smoking in 1984?

A.    1984?

Q.    Right.

A.    I believe it was Newport.

Q.    And Newport was hardly a new brand, right? It had been around for many, many, many years, correct?

A.    Well, it was introduced in the late '50s.

Q.    So if she was smoking Newports in '84 and it was introduced in the '50s it had been around for a quart quarter of a century, right?

A.    Yeah, about a quarter � well, maybe 20 years or so.  They remade the Newport marketing for it in 1970, "A lively pleasure" I believe is when that came in.

Q.    But the brand Newport was � it came out in the late '50s, right?

A.    Yes.  It wasn't a big seller until they reformulated and launched their new marketing campaign in the '70s .

Q.    And at the same time she was smoking Kools.

19 And that wasn't some new brand that had just come out

on the market, right?

A.    No, that was, again, a brand that had evolved I think from the, I believe it was the '30s.

Q.    And when she smoked Salems, that wasn't some new brand that had just come out in the market.  It also had also come out in the '50s, correct?

2047

A.     '55.

Q.    And when she smoked Winstons, that wasn't a new brand that just came out.  It was back in the '50s, right?

A.    Well, it was � actually they had introduced the line extension of Winston menthol 100s, which I believe was 1967.

Q.    Belairs had been around for a long time when she smoked them, right?

A.    No.  Actually Belair was introduced 1960.

smoking at around 1962, '63 period.

Q.    So the truth is that after she stopped smoking the brand her dad smoked and she started choosing different brands, those different brands, whether they were Winston, Salem, Kools, Lorillard, those were well-established brands that had been around for years.

A.    They were popular brands, yes.

Q.    If we could take that down.

You talked yesterday about Claude Teague, right?

A.    I did.

Q.    And Claude Teague was a chemist who was hired out of � well, a few years out of college in the

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=840
204

1 1950s by RJ Reynolds.

2     A.    No.  He was hired � he had had a prior job

3 before he came to Reynolds.  But he came to Reynolds in

4 1951.

5     Q.    And when he was hired, he was a chemist who

6 was in his 20s, right?

7     A.    That's right.

8     Q.    And he never was an executive in the

9 marketing department, right?

10     A.    Well, he was in charge of new product

11 development in the '70s, and so he was a senior level

12 person and oversaw a lot of the R&D work that Reynolds

13 did.

14     Q.    Right.  And that's what he was in.  He was

15 in research and development, right?

16     A.    That's right.  Which was integrated with

17 marketing, because the product is part of the marketing

18 mix.

19     Q.    Well, you know that the marketing group, he

20 was never an employee of the marketing group.  He

21 didn't work in advertising.

22     A.    No, he wasn't an advertiser.

Q.          And that was 1973.

A.          Correct.

Q.          And Ms. Cooper was 22 years old in 1973, right?

A.          That's right.

Q.          She was an adult.  She had already been

13 married, divorced, had a kid, right?

A.          True.

A.          That's right.

Q.          And this research planning memorandum does not talk about the brands that she smoked in the 1960s, right?

A.          No, it doesn't talk about any specific

brands,   I believe.

Q.          And because it's a research planning

23 memorandum it's talking about potential plans for the

future, right?

2050 research.

Q.    And you got ahead of me, but when you showed the jury what Claude league's thoughts on what might be a new brand, it's not talking about any specific existing brand, correct?

A.    True.

Q.    It was talking about a new brand that they might make, right?

A.    He was talking about the fact that you need to engineer brands that would have appeal to the beginning market.

Q.    Okay.  So if this is talking about future new brands that could appeal to the beginning market, it doesn't have anything to do with Ms. Cooper.  She's already been smoking for almost a decade, right?

A.    Sure.  Although it does have something to do with her.  I can explain what, because they talk about confirmed smokers and the importance of factors that keep confirmed smokers smoking.

Q.    Now, the brands, this new brand � again, those are potential new brands that they might make, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And what potential new brand did they make in 1973?

A.    In 1973?

Q.    Right.

A.    Well, they began work on reformulating Camel cigarettes.

Q.    And of course Ms. Cooper never smoked Camels, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And the truth is, even if � isn't it true even if they eventually ever made a new brand that Claude Teague was vaguely describing, Ms. Cooper didn't smoke it, right?

A.    Well �

Q.    Right?

A.    No, Claude Teague talked about other brands as well that Winston was making � or which RJ Reynolds was making rather.

Q.    Winston, this is 1973, sir.

A.    That's right.

Q.    Winston had been around since 1954.

A.    Sure.  It was reformulated.  All these brands were changed and tweaked over time.  So the fact that you come out with a brand like Belair or a brand like Winston in a given year, that brand changed, and it changed every year, unbeknownst to the public health community or any consumers, only known to the company.

13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

2052 So these brands were constantly being modified and tweaked, and those tweaks affect the smoking behavior of people like Mary Cooper.

Q.    Well, tell me right now, what new brand of cigarette for the youth market did she smoke?  You said Camels.

A.    Talking about some of the things that were described in here, and you asked about a brand that was, in fact, reformulated, and that was Camel cigarettes, Camel filters.  They utilized exactly the specifications.  They came out with a new brand, a new

tested in '73 and '74 at the board of directors meeting of RJ Reynolds where they got the advertising plans at the Hilton Head meeting.  That was talking about introducing Camel and the new formulation of Camel cigarettes to appeal to young people because Camel had aged, the smokers of Camels were pretty old at that point, and they were remaking Camel cigarettes to pick up a whole new crowd of young people.  So that is an example of how what's described here was put into practice.

	Yes.
	
	

Q.
	And when it comes to the
	Surgeon (
	General,

there isn
	't any other health risks
	that has
	received

more attention from the Surgeon General than smoking,
			
right?
	
	
	

A.
	I'd agree with that.
	
	

Q.
	And you'd agree that the
	dangers,
	the risks

2056 of smoking have been discussed by the media in this country for over 100 years.

A.    Sure.

Q.    And if we had time we could spend days with

5 me putting up documents from the 1950s, the 1930s, the

6 1920s, the 1880s, right?

7     A.    What documents are you referring to?

8     Q.    Newspaper articles, books, brochures,

9 et cetera, that refer to the risks of smoking.  And

10 Mr. Hardee could do the same on his side, correct?

11 Mr. Bass.  I'm so sorry.

12           MR. BELASIC:  All right.  I need to be

13       reprimanded, Your Honor.  I'm sorry.

14           THE COURT:  Well, we'll wait until the break

15       to do that.

16 BY MR. BELASIC:

17     Q.    The point is there's been an enormous amount

18 of media discussion, whether it's newspapers from the

19 1800s or magazines from the 1950s, right, about the

20 risks of smoking?

21     A.    The enormous discussion is really more

22 recent about the health risks of smoking.  And you can

23 track this if you do searches nowadays of textbooks and

24 so on where they mention smoking and health in the same

25 passage and do Google searches, and it really follows

going bac
	<l,   but it wasn't enormous before the � it

hasn't been enormous for 100 years.
	
Q.
	Let me give you a specific example.

Nicotine,
	the fact that cigarettes have nicotine,

that's been known for a very long time, right?
	
A.
	Sure.

Q.
	And it's been known that nicotine is in

tobacco g
	oing back 200 years, right?

A.
	Sure .

Q.
	I think you said the 1820s once.

A.
	I believe I did.

Q.
	And it's also been known for a very, very

long time
	that smoking can be difficult to quit once a

person st
	arts .

A.
	Sure.  People figure that out when they try

to quit.
	

Q.
	And when it comes to the word "addiction,"

smoking h
	as been referred to as addictive for more than

a century
	, more than 100 years.

A.
	Sure.  You can find references to addiction,

habit, th
	ose kinds of things.

Q.
	You know the examples.  Let's run through a

few.
	


	Christopher Columbus, he wrote in his

205: journals how hard it was for his men to give up smoking, what, pipes?

A.    I'm not sure if it's pipes or chew.

Q.    So even 500 years ago Christopher Columbus is noting from personal observation that it's hard to give up tobacco.

A.    He noticed � yeah, he wrote in a journal, I think it's cited in the '88 Surgeon General's Report the history of people reporting withdrawal, I think they were talking about in that reference.

Q.    And you know Mark Twain is one of the country's greatest authors, wrote Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer.  His joke was that, quitting smoking is easy, I've done it hundreds of times.

A.    Thousands of times.

Q.    And the point of the joke was to be ironic in that obviously he was having trouble quitting if he had to quit a thousand times.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And a joke is only good if people understand what the joke is about, correct?

A.    Yeah.  It's no joke that you can't quit.

Q.    And it wasn't a secret, though, in the 1800s that smoking could be hard to quit.

A.    Yeah, I agree with that.  I think smoking or

He wasn't a cigarette smoker.
	
Q.
	And you're familiar with the Florida Health

Notes.
	

A.
	Sure.

Q.
	The Florida Health Notes, particularly from

1906,
	that refer to smoking and addiction.

A.
	That's right.


	MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, we'd move to admit


	AHL 32.


	THE COURT:  I'll admit those out of order


	over their objection.


	MR. BASS:  Is it the whole document, the


	whole Health Notes?


	MR. BELASIC:  No, it's not.  We'll talk


	about that.


	MR. BASS:  Judge, we would ask that the


	whole document be moved in, Your Honor.


	MR. BELASIC:  We'll do that.


	THE COURT:  They said yes, so we'll put it

A.    True.

Q.    So that's more than 100 years ago, correct?

A.    Right.

Q.    And let's talk about it.  There's an article in there that they run about cigarettes and the boys.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And to be fair, the person who writes it was in, what, was he in some sort of opium den or something in San Francisco?

A.    He was a minister, and, yeah, he was concerned about their use of scraps and of tobacco that was being rolled up like cigarettes and to deliver various drugs.

Q.    And so this minister who was in San Francisco, he observed young boys smoking cigarettes that had been made out of what he thought were foul or unclean scraps of cigar tobacco or loose tobacco; is that right?

A.    Sure.  And also other drugs.

Q.    So he wrote then in 1906 and the Florida State Board of Health published, "To-day the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the very worst form of tobacco addiction."

2061 And my question to you is, so, again, the term "addiction" was being applied to smoking more than a century ago.

A.    Tobacco smoking or something else?  Because you have to read the whole section to have the full context.

Q.    Right here it says, "The cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the very worst form of tobacco addiction."  So a century ago he was calling cigarette smoking an addiction, the State Board of Health was, correct?

MR. BASS:  We ask for completeness that the whole passage that Dr. Cummings referred �

THE COURT:  We'll let him read the whole passage, but he can answer that question first. THE WITNESS:  He's referring to the context here of what the boys were consuming as the addiction.

MR. BELASIC:  I think you ordered him to answer the question first, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  If you can't answer it, we will read the passage.  If you need to amplify your answer, you can certainly do that, Doctor.

THE WITNESS:  I don't dispute he's written the first sentence, and the context for that is

Q.    So that wasn't the question the judge ordered you to answer.  Here's my question.  Isn't it true that 100 years ago the Florida State Board of Health was referring to cigarette smoking as the worst form of addiction?  That's the question.

A.    Sure.  You can find that reference right there.

Q. And the context was that this minister in San Francisco saw a horrible scene where young boys were smoking cigarettes made out of scraps.

A.    You can just read it and that will give the context.

Q.    Tammy, can you put it up?

It says, "To-day the cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the very worst form of tobacco addiction.  It is so cheap, it is so generally inhaled, it is often so loaded with drugs, and so many times

20 made from cigar stumps and street scrapings, that there

is every argument against its use.

"Reverend James L. Hammond tells what he saw in a San Francisco opium den:  In a room not more than twenty feet square, down three stories underground, dimly lighted and dinghy, where the air was so foul it

2063 almost overcame you as you stood in the entrance.  I found twelve Chinamen busy at work.  Sitting flat on the floor, in the midst of indescribable filth, they were rolling cigarettes for the American boy to smoke.

"There was a great pile of material in one corner of the room, and we struck a match and stopped down to examine it.  We found it was cigar stumps and quids" �

Is that right?

A.    Right.  That's when you chew up tobacco and spit it out.

Q.    � "quids of tobacco, mixed with the vilest of sewer excretions."

Did I read that correctly?

A.    You did.

Q.    And what the Florida State Department of Health published to the public is that today cigarette smoking is looked upon as the worst form of tobacco addiction, in other words, it was worse than chewing, worse than cigars.

A.    Yeah, because it was mixed with drugs and all the other stuff they're talking about.

Q.    Now, in fact, a number of states banned cigarettes, banned the sale of cigarettes.

A.    Yes.  Florida being one of them.

A.    That's right.

Q.    So even seven years before then, more than a century ago, the state of Florida decided, can't sell cigarettes at all.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And that, after some period of prohibition that was removed, correct? A.    That's right.

Q.    Now, even before the scientific studies that you talked about yesterday came out, the State of Florida was referring to cigarettes as things like coffin nails, for example, correct? A.    The State of Florida?

Q.    Yeah, the State � again, the same state health bulletins, the State Board of Health.

A.    They may have, yeah.  Don't dispute it. Those terms have been around for a while.

(Defendants' Exhibit AHL 34 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    So can you put it up on the screen, Tammy?

So it's from the Florida Health Notes.  And, again, that's the official State Board of Health by the state government of the State of Florida more than a century ago, September 1912, right in the middle of

15 World War I.

A.    Well, start of World War I, maybe.

Q.    Oh, 1914, Your Honor.  Two years before

18 World War I

A.    Right.

Q.    And here they're talking about Kansas City.

said, "There have always been quite a number of very decent people who could not understand why they should be forced to submit to the stench of forty-seven varieties of pipes, el cabbagoes --

A.    Cigars.

Q.    Cigars:

� "two-fers, coffin-nails, et cetera, simply because a minority of smokers assumed the right to pollute the air in this way."

And so the state board � I mean, the Florida State Board of Health is referring to cigarettes there as coffin nails, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    102 years ago.

A.    Yeah.

Q.    And coffin nail had been around since the 1800s, right?

A.    Sure.  That term has been around for a long time.

Q.    And the coffin was literally the pine box that they would bury you in, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And so when they referred to coffin nails, they meant the cigarette, it was about the size of a long nail that you would nail down the top of the coffin.

A.    Sure.

Q.    And it was a slang term that meant cigarettes could kill ya.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And that when she heard the other smokers refer to cigarettes as cancer sticks on that incident she said she asked for one because she was out? A.    Right.

If they're used for any other purpose other than just admission on your side, then I would consider not allowing them to do it, but that's the reason I'm doing it, is just strictly the volume and we don't lose track of all these exhibits, okay?

Mr. Belasic, you may continue. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    Yesterday, Dr. Cummings, you showed the jury some news coverage, for example, Life Magazine, various scientific studies and other news about a link between smoking and lung cancer.

A.    Correct.

Q.    And I'm going to spend, I guess, the next half hour talking about some of the other media publications.

But before that, we were talking about slang terms.  People have used slang terms to describe nicotine addiction or smoking for nicotine for a long time, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And people who smoke cigarettes have been referred to as nicotine fiends?

A.    Correct.

Q.    People who smoke cigarettes they call each other nicotine slaves, right?

A.    Yeah, heard that one too.

Q.    There's a reference to something called lady nicotine that's been around for about a century.

A.
	Right.

Q.
	And the reason they called it a lady is

because
	nicotine was a seductress and could entrap the

unwary smoker, right?
	
A.
	Sure.

Q.
	And all of those things have been used for

about a
	century, right?

A.
	True.

Q.
	And sometime in the 20th century the term

nicotine
	fit was popularly used.

A.
	Yep.

Q.
	And well before Ms. Cooper started smoking

in the '
	60s there were those terms, nicotine fit,

nicotine
	fiend, lady nicotine, nicotine slave that were

being used to suggest that people were smoking for
	
nicotine
	?

A.
	Sure .

Q.
	I think you briefly mentioned Reader's

Digest y
	esterday; is that correct?

A.
	I might have.

Q.
	In the '30s, '40s and '50s, the decades

before M
	s. Cooper started smoking, Reader's Digest was

the most
	popular magazine in the country, right?

A.
	True.

Q.
	And in the time before you had the Internet

Reader's Digest was one of the more important and popular sources of information in the country.

A.    Yeah.  It was a popular magazine.

Q.    And the people that ran Reader's Digest were very antitobacco.

A.    They were.  They didn't cover � they didn't take cigarette advertising.

Q.    And over the years they published a series of articles on smoking.

A.    They did.

Q.    And the articles the Reader's Digest ran about smoking were important enough that the Surgeon General himself wrote in a report that it had an effect on what Americans knew about smoking.

A.    Sure, because it was one of the few

16 magazines that didn't take cigarette ads

Q.    And because it was the most popular magazine in the country that was running.  It was the one that

19 more people bought than any other.

A.    Yeah, in the '30s and the '40s, yes.

Q.    And the '50s it was the most popular �

A.    It was waning in popularity in the '50s and '60s.

Q.    And it was so popular that Reader's Digest was even in the house and the home where Ms. Cooper

A.    I believe that's true.

Q.    And Ms. Cooper agrees that she would read it once or twice, although when we asked her she was quick to say she doesn't remember a tobacco article.  Is that --

A.    Yeah, because there weren't � you know, relative to all the articles the tobacco articles were a very tiny fraction.

Q.    And they were publishing articles long before the CTR, Council for Tobacco Research and the TIRC, Tobacco Industry Research Committee, were formed; is that right? A.    Yeah.

Q.    You have articles in front of you.  Cancer by the Carton, you're very familiar with that article, correct?

A.    I am.

Q.    And that ran in Reader's Digest in 1952.

MR. BELASIC:  So can you put that up, Tammy. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    The title Cancer By the Carton pretty easy to grasp, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    Carton of cigarettes is a carton of cancer.

A.    It says, "Recent medical research on the relationship of smoking and lung cancer."

Q.    Right.  And the title, if all you read was the title, you'd be hearing cancer in a carton of cigarettes, right?  They're linking the two right off the bat in the title.

A.    Sure.

Q.    And that was 1952.  What month was that? December 1952.  So that was when Ms. Cooper was one year old, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And it was in the most popular magazine in the country.

Let's look at � if you could look at the next one in front of you, Dr. Cummings.  You're familiar with the famous article Nicotine Knockout, Or the Slow Count?

A.    Sure.  Gene Tunney.

THE COURT:  Out of order subject to what I said, it's in evidence.

(Defendants' Exhibit AIW 142 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    You mentioned Gene Tunney.  So this article it was written by Gene Tunney, who was the former heavy weight boxing champion of the world, right? A.    That's right.

Q.    And as the former heavy weight boxing champion of the world, the navy hired him to be in charge of their physical training and their athletics. A.    Correct.  This is during the war. Q.    And he was one of the most famous athletes in America at that time, right? A.    Sure.

Q.    He had been a big famous boxer and had fought an even more famous boxer � A.    Joe Louis. Q.    � Jack Dempsey twice, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    So the reference to the Nicotine Knockout, or the Slow Count is when he had been saved in a fight when they knockout and they tap � either give you the 8 count or the 10 count, the ref was slow on the count, he might have got an extra few seconds and that saved him.  And he got up and he ended up winning the bout, right?

A.    Right.

Q.    So that was good marketing for the article, the slow count.

A.    Sure.

Q.    And right in this title it says Nicotine Knockout, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And in 1941, that's 10 years before

17 Ms. Cooper is even born.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And that's more than 20 years before

20 Ms. Cooper has ever picked up a cigarette, right?

A.    True.

Q.    And the most popular magazine in the country is referring to nicotine as a knockout. A.    True. Q.    Now, you mentioned Joe Louis.  At that time

Q.    And one of the most famous people in the United States, correct?

A.    True.  He advertised different brands of cigarettes.

Q.    Thank you for that.  Although that's not what I asked.

He was one of the greatest boxers ever.

A.    Yes.  Not the greatest, but one of the greatest.

Q.    And it would have been very difficult for Gene Tunney in his age to beat Joe Louis in his prime, one of the greatest boxers ever.

A.    Sure.

Q.    So in that article Gene Tunney says, you know what, I'll challenge Joe Louis if we could get Joe Louis to start smoking cigarettes.  Then and only then I'11 fight him.

A.    Yeah, he was a smoker actually.

Q.    And he says he knows that smoking would prevent Joe Louis from doing his best, right?

A.    That's what he's talking about, yes.

Q.    So he also makes some specific statements about smoking and nicotine.  Let's look at the first

207 one.  Right on the first page he says, "Heavy smoking has a positive and demonstrably bad effect on longevity, physical and nervous energy, and general health.  With every puff, heavy smokers shorten their own lives."

Right?

A.    Right.  He's actually referencing a study that comes afterwards from Johns Hopkins.

Q.    If we could look at the next highlight, T ammy.

And he says the cause of most of the trouble is, of course, nicotine.

A.    Right.

Q.    So if you're reading this article you're thinking that � you are being told that nicotine is the cause of the trouble with smoking, right?

A.    Ah, yes.

Q.    And that's �

A.    Among other things he talks about in the article.

A.    Yes.

Q.    � right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And the documents that you showed from the tobacco companies that say nicotine is a central part of smoking, they were all years after this 1941 article, right?

A.    True.

Q.    So if you read in Reader's Digest, the most popular magazine in the country, the idea that nicotine is the source of the trouble, that's not a secret.

A.    He's talking about no one has ever denied that nicotine is a poison, because it is.  Nicotine is an insecticide.

Q.    My question is about if you're reading the

17 most popular magazine in the country and it says the

cause of most of the trouble is nicotine, the central fact of smoking is nicotine, that wasn't a secret at the time, it was in the public.

2 popular news magazine of the day then obviously it

3 wasn't a secret, it's something that was being publicly

4 discussed openly.

5     A.    I would agree, it's in the Reader's Digest.

6 I don't deny that it's in the Reader's Digest.  Doesn't

7 [mean it was known to smokers. Q.    But it means it's not secret, right?

9 Because a secret fact wouldn't be published in the most

10 popular magazine in the United States.

11     A.    What secret are you referring to?  I don't

12 understand your question exactly.  I mean, people knew

13 that there was nicotine in cigarettes.  I don't think

14 people knew how � the secret was how it was

15 manipulated in cigarettes to keep people smoking �

nicotine.  That statement wasn't a secret.  The cause of most of the trouble is nicotine is something that was being publicly sent out in the most popular publication of the nation.

THE COURT:  It's a very specific answer.  He did explain it with some detail.  Answer it one more time and move to another topic. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    It's just a simple question.  What he said here wasn't secret, can we agree on that?

A.    What he said wasn't secret, what was in the article is a public article.

Q.    All right.  And, in fact, he goes on to say that nicotine is the source of all pleasure derived from smoking.

A.    He does.

Q.    So that idea, the fact that people were smoking for nicotine or that the pleasure they got from smoking was nicotine that also was being publicly discussed.

A.    It's in the article.  He talks about nicotine is the source of the pleasure derived from smoking.  And then they talk about some of the

22 mechanisms by which that might be true.

Q.    And even before 1941 Reader's Digest was publishing articles that said smoking was an addiction, right?

A.    Henry Link.

2083 nearly every cigarette smoker discovers that he's not smoking by choice but by habit.  The habit is probably harmful."

This is 1938 and someone � I mean, a doctor is being published in Reader's Digest to say it's not a choice, right?

A.    It says it's -- yes, he says, "So he tries to break free from it, but finds that he doesn't know how. "

Q.    And if we could go to page 17, the first paragraph.  Sorry, it's the next highlight, Tammy.

And so just so we're clear, this 1938 Reader's Digest publication is referring to smoking as an addiction.

A.    As a habit and as an addiction.

Q.    Right.  "Sometimes half-heartedly, sometimes earnestly, he wrestles with his addiction - but in vain."

Right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And you said Reader's Digest you weren't sure about the '50s, but it was definitely the most popular magazine in the '30s in the Depression?

2085 Right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Most important.

That was 20 years before Claude Teague was writing articles about nicotine, correct?  The 1970s.

A.    Actually he was talking about nicotine in his 1953 summary of survey of cancer research where he looked back into the literature going back into the '20s, the '30s, the '40s.

Q.    I think the '53 document you talked about you said had to do with � it's called Survey of Carcinogenesis.

A.    Yeah.

Q.    And the '70s Claude Teague memos that you showed us were about new brands and nicotine, right?

A.    Yeah, because he was now in charge of new brand development for the company.

Q.    My question is this article 1950, it's 20 years before the Claude Teague memos that you showed about nicotine in cigarettes and new brands that might be developed.

A.    Those articles, but the survey talks about nicotine because some of the animal studies that he references and has in tables they fractionated the tar for the animal experiments and they looked at the

2086 effects of nicotine independent of other constituents in the tar.

Q.    So the idea that nicotine was an essential ingredient or it was a central ingredient or it was important to smoking that was being published even before 1950.

A.    Sure.  There's articles in the literature.

Q.    Just like it was being communicated in all the slang terms to say that smokers were nicotine fiends, having nicotine fits?

A.    I'm not sure what you're referring to all the articles.  I mean, there are really just a handful of articles that talked about nicotine and addiction. I mean, most people considered smoking a habit not an addiction or drug reinforced behavior.

Q.    My question was about the slang terms.  Just as these articles referred, the slang terms communicated to people that smokers were being labelled as nicotine fiends, nicotine � you know, a nicotine fit, nicotine slaves, all of the slang terms for smoking were either about nicotine or about killing you, coffin nails, cancer stick.

A.    There wasn't really much information in the public literature, the public domain about smoking killing you before 1950.  I mean, you can find a

2087 handful of articles, but the vast majority of the articles that talked about the health effects of smoking begin to occur after the health information started to come out in the 1950s and much more after 1964.  So while you can find Reader's Digest articles and so on, most of the public statements, that is in newspapers and magazines and so on, before 1950 really didn't talk about the risks of smoking.

Q.    Why are you talking about the articles, sir? I asked you very specifically twice now about the slang terms.

Could we have the court reporter read the question back �

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative �

MR. BELASIC:  � see if he can answer it.

THE COURT:  Okay, everybody stop.

Read the question back.

(A portion of the record was read by the reporter.)

THE WITNESS:  I was referring to the coffin nail and cancer stick articles. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    Again, you're talking about articles, sir. Do you understand what slang term means?

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative.

THE COURT:  You can follow up.  Start again, ask him another question so we know exactly what the answer is. BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    I'm talking about the slang terms.  The slang terms coffin nails and cancer stick communicated that smoking could kill you. A.    Sure.

Q.    The slang terms nicotine fit, nicotine fiend, nicotine slave communicated to smokers that smoking was for nicotine.

A.    Smoking was hard to quit, yep. Q.    And that the reason was nicotine? A.    Sure.

Q.    Now, you talked yesterday briefly about Doctors Wynder and Graham.  If you look, Wynder and Graham were widely reported.  Their study that first came out in 1950 was widely reported in the press.

A.    There were five studies actually that came out.  Wynder and Graham was just one of the five.

Q.    My question, again, Dr. Cummings, was about

24 Wynder and Graham.  So just be very clear, Wynder and

Graham was widely covered in the press in 1950.

BY MR. BELASIC:
	
Q.
	There we see the cover that's Newsweek from

June 12th
	, 1950, right?

A.
	Correct.

Q.
	That's more than a year before Ms. Cooper is

born.
	

A.
	True.

Q.
	Twelve or 13 years before she ever smokes a

cigarette
	, right?

A.
	True.

Q.
	Let's look at the article.  Title is

Smoker's
	Lungs.  And it talks about the first study,

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=882
2090

1 it's talking about the statistics from the study show

2 that the more heavily the person smokes the greater are

3 his chances of being afflicted.

4           This study is talking about smokers who

5 smoke heavily get more lung cancer, correct?

6     A.    That's what they found.  There was a dose

7 response.

8     Q.    Let's talk about another study.  In 1951 the

9 American Cancer Society was collecting data on smokers

10 and lung cancer, correct?

11     A.    True.

12     Q.    And Ms. Cooper was born in 1951.

13     A.    That's right.

14     Q.    And at the time the American Cancer Society

15 they thought they were going to do a five-year study,

16 right?

17     A.    Correct.

18     Q.    And they decided to release it after three

19 years.

20     A.    That's right.

21     Q.    Because they thought the results were

22 significant enough that they didn't want to wait.

23     A.    They had accumulated enough cancer cases to

24 be able to report a finding they thought was important.

And he was the chief statistician, the statistician of the American Cancer Society his name was E � was Edward Cuyler Hammond.  And sometimes they refer to his work as the Hammond/Horn study, right?

Q.    Because the other gentleman, the other researcher was named Horn?

A.    Daniel Horn, yes.

Q.    And they said his material was show-stopping.  His figures proving that cigarettes � heavy cigarette smokers die younger than nonsmokers

the lung, right?

A.    Correct.

A.    True.  I think it was referenced in the stock drop around that time.

Q.    And a few years later in 1957 they released the remainder of their study or further data, correct?

A.    Yeah, over many years they continued to release data on the study.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor AIW 262. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Defendants' Exhibit AIW 262 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BELASIC:

Q. So the title is Smoking & Health. And, once again, they're reporting and they say, the results are from a mountain of cross-checked statistics submitted to the AMA last week. They concluded: 1, all smoking shortens life; 2, cigarette smoking is by far the worst offender, and, three, the risk goes up with the amount smoked.

So a popular magazine was covering the announcement that the more you smoked the less likely you would be to live longer?

A.    Yeah, right.

Q.    And you talked about the Wynder and Graham studies, Doctors Wynder and Graham did what is collectively or sort of colloquially called mouse painting, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And you explained to the jury that they

2094 condense cigarette smoke and they paint the gooey tar on the backs of mice.

A.    They collect the burning byproducts and they collect that and that's what they use.

Q.    And you showed the jury � there's the woman in Canasta pants.  You showed the jury that in 1953 Life magazine covered that and had an article that talked about the link between smoking and lung cancer, right?

A.    I did.

Q.    And even though the study was in rats, they suggested that the results � or mice, the results of in mice caused great concern for possible impact on humans, correct?

A.    The results in mice were consistent with the observation that in humans you were finding a higher risk of disease.  Dr. Wynder, as you pointed out, had done a study in 1950 that showed heavy smokers were

19 much more likely to get lung cancer.

Q.    In 1953 that was two years after Ms. Cooper was born, right?  She wasn't going to smoke for another 10 years.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And Life Magazine that published that article that you showed the jurors, Life Magazine was

A.    Yes.

Q.    And the length of that clip was maybe 60 seconds.  I tried to time it, didn't have a stopwatch out, right?  It was a short snippet.

A.    It's just one of � they had 8 or 9 different people who appeared on the show both pro and con on the cigarette issue.  And it was just Dr. DuPuis because he worked for Philip Morris and also was the chairman of the technical research committee of the TIRC at the time.

Q.    But you've watched the whole show, both shows, you've watched the whole shows?

A.    Sure.

Q.    To be fair, you know that only a very small part of that time on the two shows is devoted to the people from tobacco industry and most of it is devoted to the researchers who are saying smoking is dangerous.

A.    No, I'd say about half and half would be my assessment.  I mean, there are people who are skeptical who don't work for the industry who were interviewed and there are people who � like Dr. Hammond is interviewed, I believe Dr. Wynder was interviewed.

VOICE:  In 1952, Drs. Hammond and Horn of the American Cancer Society began an extended study of the smoking habits of American men. Here is Dr. Hammond reporting on the results of the first two years.

209 greatly increases the probability of developing lung cancer.

In my opinion people should be warned of the dangers, and they are being warned.  What they then want to do, whether they wish to smoke or not, is their own business. (Video clip concluded.) BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.    And who was that gentleman?  Can you remind us again?

A.    That was E. Cuyler Hammond.

Q.    And that was the chief statistician of the

13 American Cancer Society?

A.          That's right.

Q.          He was saying people are being warned.

A.          Yeah.

Q.          Okay, so we're going to stop in a few

18 minutes.  Let's just close with just talking about the

1964 Surgeon General's Report that said smoking causes lung cancer, causes larynx cancer, right?

A.    Right.

Q.    That was big news, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And when it comes to public health, certainly one of the biggest stories of the last 50 years, right?

A.    Ah, yeah.

Q.    So it was front page news in just about every newspaper around the country, right?  I'm not exaggerating.

A.    No, you're not.

Q.    Front page.

A.    Yep.

Q.    You've seen them, I could show you a whole bunch of newspaper articles.

A.    I have them too.  I did a whole exhibit on the Surgeon General's Report.

Q.    And of course it was the big story on network news?

A.    Yes.

Q.    As well as local news.

A.    Sure.

Q.    And there were three networks back then, right?

A.    ABC, NBC, CBS.

Q.    And the highest rated, they called it the

A.    Right.

Q.    And the famous, famous news anchor from the

A.    That's right.

Q. And you're familiar with how Harry Reasoner broke the news of '64 report that smoking caused lung cancer and larynx cancer, right?

A. Familiar with the show and I believe Howard Cullman appeared on the show.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, we'd like to show a clip from the actual news.  And it was what, January 1964, right?

THE WITNESS:  Right.  I think it was the same day of the report.

MR. BELASIC:  So, Your Honor we'd � THE WITNESS:  January 1.

MR. BELASIC:  � like to admit the Harry Reasoner CBS news coverage from January 1964. THE COURT:  In evidence. (Defendants' Exhibit Video Clip: Harry Reasoner CBS news coverage from January 1964 was received in evidence.)

(Video clip was played and taken down to the best of the reporter's ability as follows:)

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=893
2101

1           VOICE:  This is a CBS News Extra on Smoking

2       and Health:  The findings of the Surgeon

3       General's Committee.

4           VOICE:  Almost from the moment that

5       cigarettes were introduced they were attacked,

6       but the attacks took a new turn 10 years ago and

7       culminated in today's report by the Surgeon

8       General's Committee.

9           This, in summary, is what the committee

10       says:

11           Cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung

12       cancer in men and data on women smokers points

13       the same way.

14           Cigarette smoking is a significant cause of

15       cancer of the larynx and probably the most

16       important cause of chronic bronchitis.

17           Cigarette smoking may be related to other

18       lung diseases.

19           Male smokers have a much higher death rate

20       from heart disease, although it's not proven

21       that smoking is the cause.

22           On the question of filters the committee

23       says there is no evidence that they do any good,

24       but it didn't exclude the possibility that an

25       effective filter might be developed.

1           In short, the committee says, if you smoke

2       cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying

3       early.  The sooner you start, the more you

4       smoke, the more you inhale, the worse your

5       chances are.

6           It's like being told that an old friend has

7       all along been betraying you.  In a case like

8       that, you give the old friend every possible

9       chance before you finally decide to believe what

10       you have been told, and maybe even then you give

11       him a chance to reform.

12           In this kind of a country it comes down to

13       you, whether you like it or not.  No one is

14       going to forbid an adult to smoke and it is now

15       quite clear that no one is going to tell him

16       it's good for him either.  The decision is his,

17       the decision and the health that may depend on

18       it.

19           This is Harry Reasoner.  Good night.

20            (Video clip concluded.)

21           MR. BELASIC:  Be a good stopping point, Your

22       Honor.

23           THE COURT:  Folks, we'll break for the

24       evening then, let you beat the traffic.  Don't

25       discuss the case with anyone, don't access the

CROSS-EXAMINATION, CONTINUING, BY MR. BELASIC:

Q.  Dr. Cummings, you testified about the warnings.  I think it was on a Tuesday.  I don't think we put the warnings into evidence.

Do you have demonstrative exhibits of the three warnings in front of you?

A.  Yes, you provided those to me. Q.  And I've given those to Mr. Bass as well.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, I'd move into evidence PDEM7, 8, and 9, which are the three warnings.

THE COURT:  All right.  In evidence. (Defendants' Exhibits PDEM7, PDEM8,

MR. BELASIC:  Can we put up the first warning?

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  And that occurred on all packages of cigarettes from 1966 to 1969, right?

A.  Correct.

MR. BELASIC:  The next one.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  And then from '70 to 1984, the Surgeon General has determined cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And then 1985, there were four rotating warnings, and that means that one out of every four packages � well, you tell me.

A.  They rotate.

Q.  They rotate.  So one-fourth of the packs produced would have the lung cancer, heart disease warning.  One-fourth would have the warning that says:  Quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health.  One-fourth would have the other warnings?

A.  Correct.

Q.  All right.  And it was the federal government that told the companies exactly what

the warnings should say, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And it was the federal government that told the warnings � that told the companies where the warnings should be placed on the package, on the side?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And it was the federal government, actually federal law that said how big the print should be?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now we talked about, yesterday,

13 Ms. Cooper becoming a regular smoker, buying

cigarettes after the warnings went on.

Do you remember when I asked you and we talked about that the Surgeon General determined that from '64 to '79, 30 million people quit, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And another government study, you know, that they looked at the four years from 1966 to 1970, and about 13 million people quit smoking then, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And 1966 to 1970, when the 13 million

people quit smoking, that was the first four years
	
the warning appeared on the pack?
	
A.
	Yeah, there was other things like

Fairness
	Doctrine that were happening at that time

as well.
	

Q.
	But it was the first four years of the

warning?
	

A.
	Sure .

Q.
	And 13 million quit, and you agree

Ms . Coop*
	Br did not even try to quit in the

1960s?
	

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Now Mr. Bass and you discussed an FTC

report, <
	and the FTC is the Federal Trade

Commission, and it was from 1967, right, the first
	
one?
	

A.
	It was the first one, yes.

Q.
	And so in 1967, the Federal Trade

Commission looks at the warnings.  So the warning
	
came out
	in January '66.


	The FTC, when they did their report, it

was only
	one year after the warnings had been out,

right?
	

A.
	That's right.

Q.
	So the warning had only one year to have

2117

whatever impact it was going to have; is that correct?

A.  Correct.

Q. And the Federal Trade Commission report that you told the jury about, it relied on three surveys, right?

A.  No, it relied on cigarette sales predominantly to look at the effects of the warning and cigarette sales rebounded, and by that

ineffective.

Q.  The Federal Trade Commission report that you told the jury about cited three surveys, correct?

A.  Well, they had other surveys that they cite, not just three, by the way, several surveys. I think we showed some of the surveys on smoker beliefs about light cigarettes or filtered cigarettes, I believe.

Q.  So we're talking about 1967, the Federal Trade Commission report.  You decided to show it to the jury, right?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  So one of the surveys that that 1967 FTC report looked at was from 1964, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  So obviously that survey from 1964, that couldn't measure the effect of the warning because that was two years before the warning.  The warning wasn't even out?

A.  Yes.  It wasn't used for that purpose.

Q.  And there was a survey they relied on that actually went out to people who were studying smoking and health, correct, 1967 survey?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And that survey went out to 450 people, correct?

A.  Right.

Q.  But it wasn't 450 smokers, it was 450 doctors or researchers who were studying smoking and health, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And so that study was just one year after the warning, and that survey did not ask actual smokers what they thought?

A.  No, they were asking public health professionals their view of what � whether the warnings were effective or whether they needed to be increased in their potency.

Q.  Now over the years, you have reviewed a

lot of surveys about public awareness of the risks of smoking, correct?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And over the years, the Surgeon General of the United States has also reviewed a lot of polls about the public's awareness of the risks of smoking, correct?

A.  Yes, they have.

Q.  And one of the polls that the Surgeon General has often reviewed and relied upon are the Gallup polls, right?

A.  Gallup, among others.

Q.  And Gallup is certainly one of the most, if not the most, famous polling group in the country?

A.  Sure, Gallup and Roper are probably the best known.

Q.  And 25 years after the first Surgeon General's report, 25 years later in 1989, the Surgeon General published a new report on smoking and health that sort of reviewed the progress that had gone on over the last 25 years, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And one of the things 25 years later that the Surgeon General did was look at public

surveys and summarize public surveys of what people knew about the health risks of smoking, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And, in fact, you were a contributor in some way to that report, correct?

A.  I wrote the chapter on the History of Smoking Cessation for that report.

Q.  Okay.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, I'm going to

report on polling and the exhibit number is AS35.

THE COURT:  Have you seen that?

MR. BASS:  Just for the rule of, completeness we ask that the whole report be admitted, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'll let them move in what they want on their side, out of order, and then you-all can move in what else you want.  Okay?

MR. BASS:  Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  We'll do that.

(Defendants' Exhibit AS35 was received in evidence.)

MR. BELASIC:  Can you put that up, T ammy ?

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So that's the 1989
	

Surgeon General's report, correct?
	

A.  Yes, a bad copy of it, but, yes.
	

Q.  Where do we get the clean copies of the
	

reports?
	

A.  You can order them.  I'll give you the
	

Surgeon General's report.  I have a whole
	

collection of them.
	

Q.  All right.  So here � and you have the
	

materials in front of you as well, Dr. Cummings?
	

A.  Sure, you gave these to me.
	

Q.  Okay.  So I think it was Chapter 4, the
	

Surgeon General at that time summarized and put
	

tables of a whole bunch of polls and surveys of
	

what people believed, knew, and were aware of the
	

risks of smoking, right?
	

A.  Sure.
	

Q.  And one of the things they surveyed here
	

is the Surgeon General looked at seven polls of,
	

right at the top, public knowledge about smoking
	

and cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx,
	

esophagus, right?
	

A.  Yes.
	

Q.  And you know we're here in this case
	

because of a claim for larynx cancer?

A.  That's right.

Q.  So do you see that the first Gallup poll was from 1977?

A.  Yes, I do.

Q.  And at that time, they just surveyed all nonsmokers, so it was nonsmokers, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And 79 percent said that they thought smoking causes cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And then the next year, we can look at the second poll, and that was 1978, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And in 1978, Ms. Cooper was 27 years old, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  She had the ability to quit at that time, correct?

A.  She had the ability to make a quit attempt.  The evidence is that she did not have the ability to sustain it.

Q.  Okay.  Let me just write that down. Even in 1978, you don't believe that Ms. Cooper had the ability to quit?

1           MR. BASS:  Objection.  Mischaracterizes

2 testimony.

3           THE COURT:  Overruled.

4           You can answer the question.

5           THE WITNESS:  The evidence is that she

6 was trying to quit in the '80s and '90s and was

7 unsuccessful in doing so.

8      Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  But if you can answer

9 my question.  In 1978, in your expert opinion, did

10 Ms. Cooper have the ability to quit smoking?

11      A.  She had the ability to make a quit

12 attempt had she had full and complete information,

13 which she did not have, and that hinders making

14 quit attempts, because that motivates quit

15 attempts.

16           She did not have the ability in my

17 opinion based on my review of her smoking history

18 and the level of her nicotine addiction to sustain

19 it.

20      Q.  Okay.  1978, ability to quit smoking.

21 You said sustained � can I write:  Ability to

22 quit smoking for the long-term?

23      A.  Well, actually what I said ability to

24 quit was hindered by the misinformation coming

25 from your company.

Q.  Right.  But I'm not asking you about that, Doctor.  You understand that your counsel, after two days and one hour of questioning, will also get additional questions, and that right now you'll need to answer mine, do you understand that?

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  All right.  What's the next question, please?

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  My question is:

based on all the facts you've reviewed in 1978, she didn't have that ability, correct?

A.  She didn't � she had the ability to

15 make a quit attempt, sure.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, I'm not asking about the ability to make a quit attempt.  I'm trying to be as clear as I can with this witness.

THE WITNESS:  There's a difference between making a quit attempt and sustaining it and she was not able to sustain it.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  And my question to you is:  In 1978, did she have the ability to quit smoking, not make an effort, did she have the ability to stop smoking for good in 1978?

A.  She did not have the ability to sustain quitting.  That's what the evidence shows.

Q.  All right.  So we were back to this survey, and this time in 1978, when Ms. Cooper was 27, they surveyed current smokers, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And 73 percent of the current smokers said that they believed that smoking caused cancer of the mouth, throat, and larynx, right, so three out of every four smokers, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And that was more than 35 years ago, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And then in 1981, Gallup looked at it again, and it was 69 percent of smokers thought that it caused larynx cancer?

A.  Yes, it went down.

Q.  And in 1985, when the warning was on the pack about lung cancer and emphysema, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  In 1985, 83 percent of current smokers believed smoking caused larynx cancer, correct?

A.  In '85, it was a different question.  It says:  Do you think that cigarette smoking is or

Q.  Right, and 83 percent said that, yes, cigarette smoking is one of the causes of larynx cancer?

A.  Right, to that different question.

Q.  Now you know that during the '60s, '70s, '80s, and even after, there have been various advertisements to quit smoking on television?

A.  Sure, there were in the '60s, '70s, and '80s, yeah.

Q.  And one of those was by the famous actor Yul Brynner?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you know from Ms. Cooper's testimony that she knew Yul Brynner?

A.  I do?

Q.  Well, not the knew, but she knew of him?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And to be fair, she said that she did not remember if she saw a Yul Brynner advertisement, right?

A.  She remembers Yul Brynner as an actor.

Q.  And so Yul Brynner made a very famous advertisement to quit smoking, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And when was that?

A.  It was in the mid 1980s, I believe, late 1980s.

Q.  Now let me just ask you one question. You mentioned the Fairness Doctrine.  How long did the Fairness Doctrine exist?  What were the years?

A.  It went from 1967 to 1970.

Q.  Okay.

A.  Essentially under the Fairness Doctrine, public service ads were run on prime-time television.  It was supposed to be for every cigarette ad.

It turned out it was about a four to one ratio for cigarette ads for every one public service ad, but it was one of the first times until recently we had a national campaign educating people about the dangers of smoking.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, the question was, when was the Fairness Doctrine �

THE COURT:  That's the only question that was posed.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  And it was '67 to '70, right, Dr. Cummings?

A.  That's what I said.

Q.  So the Yul Brynner ad was in the 1980s. It was not required by any Fairness Doctrine? A.  No, it was published by the American Cancer Society.

Q.  The American Cancer Society was putting it out on their own, and in the 1980s, when the Yul Brynner ad ran, there were no TV ads for smoking, correct? A.  True.

Q.  Those had been banned way back in 1971, when Ms. Cooper was only about 20? A.  That's right.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, I move in the Yul Brynner advertisement.  It's AN3130.

THE COURT:  In evidence out of order. (Defendants' Exhibit AN3130 was received in evidence.)

MR. BELASIC:  So let's play this. (Video clip played as follows:) VOICE:  Ladies and gentlemen, the late Yul Brynner.

you, don't smoke.  Whatever you do, just don't smoke.

If I could take back that smoking, we wouldn't be talking about any cancer.  I'm convinced about that.

(Video clip concluded.)

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  And Yul Brynner had lung cancer?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now you've heard of Larry Hagman.  He was the star of Dallas, probably the most popular late night or nighttime soap opera of the '80s?

A.  Sure.  I Dream of Jeannie as well.

Q.  And Larry Hagman also did a commercial, correct, an antismoking commercial?

A.  Right, for the Cancer Society.  It was part of the Great American Smokeout.

Q.  And so the American Cancer Society had what you just mentioned, the Great American Smokeout, and that was a nationwide campaign to have a day on which every smoker would quit smoking for 24 hours, correct?

A.  The third Thursday of every November.

Q.  Okay.  And obviously from what you said yesterday, Ms. Cooper never stopped smoking for

MR. BELASIC:  So, Your Honor, I'd move in the Larry Hagman advertisement.  It's AN759. THE COURT:  In evidence out of order. (Defendants' Exhibit AN759 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Before we play it, this also ran � when did this run?

A.  This was in the early '80s.  The smokeout started in '77, and I believe they had a celebrity that they used every year.

Q.  So the early '80s, when Ms. Cooper would have been, what, 30, 31 years old?

A.  Yeah.  It was when Dallas was running. So I'd have to go back and figure out when Dallas was on television.

Q.  Thank you.  Let's play it.

(Video clip played as follows:) VOICE:  What would happen if you stopped smoking cigarettes right now, right this minute?

Now you have every reason in the world to stop smoking cigarettes because now you know what will happen if you do, and what will happen if you don't.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So, again, that ran way after the Fairness Doctrine was over, right?

A.  It did.

Q.  Ed Asner, you've heard of him?

A.  Sure, he did the same thing.

Q.  Right, he was the star of the Mary Tyler

A.  That's right.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, I would � Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  And you know that Ed

A.  Yes, December 14th.

Q.  And it was a meeting between Hill & Knowlton which was a public relations company and the tobacco companies?

A.  No, the first meeting was just the heads of the cigarette companies, and at that meeting on the 14th, they decided to hire Hill & Knowlton, and the Hill & Knowlton folks came in on the 15th.

Q.  Right, and that's what I'm talking about.  You know that on December 15th, '53, a man named Bert Goss who was the vice president of Hill & Knowlton had that meeting?

A.  No, they were at the meeting the day before.  The president couldn't attend the meeting on that day.

Q.  All right.  So let's look at Page � let's look at Page 2, Section 3, of the Hill & Knowlton memo, and can you blow that up?  The industry's position?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So Hill & Knowlton talked to the industry what their position was and what it was they wanted to communicate?

A.  Right, they interviewed the research directors.  I think we talked about that.

Q.  And Hill & Knowlton writes after this

convinced that there is no sound scientific basis for the charges that have been made.

and in some cases represent publicity issued in the hopes of attracting funds and support for further research.

Right.  So when the people from Hill & Knowlton met with the industry in that private

point did not think there was a sound scientific basis, right?

A.  That's what it says.

Q.  The second paragraph, it says � again, they're talking about what the tobacco company officials told them, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  It says:  They point out that the National Cancer Institute of the U.S. Public Health Administration, which is a government agency and supported by congressional appropriations has officially refuted the tie-up between cigarette smoking and cancer. Did I read that correctly?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now in 1953, the National Cancer Institute, in fact, had not taken a position that smoking causes cancer, correct?

A.  That's true.

A.  1957.

Q.  All right.  And the head of the National Cancer Institute was a man named John Heller?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And John Heller was telling Congress and the public in interviews, head of the federal National Cancer Institute, that at that time, the time they had the meeting, there was not sufficient evidence to show that smoking caused lung cancer, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And that's what the industry was telling Hill & Knowlton, that the National Cancer Institute had determined, at least by then, that there wasn't enough evidence?

A.  Well, that's true.  That's what they were telling Hill & Knowlton.

Q.  Well, and it's what the National Cancer Institute in 1953 was telling Congress and the public, not sufficient evidence in 1953?

A. No, these are notes from the meeting at the Plaza Hotel. So these are just the notes to Hill & Knowlton.

Q.  Right, I'm not asking you about that, sir.  In 1953, the National Cancer Institute was also telling the public and Congress, John Heller, that there was not yet sufficient evidence to show that smoking caused lung cancer?

A.  Sure.

Q.  I mean we don't disagree on that?

A.  No, we don't.

Q.  Now you're familiar with a book from 1961, called Tobacco, Experimental and Clinical Studies, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  You can � I'll give it to you.  You can read the whole thing before I ask you questions about it.

A.  That's okay.  You don't need to give it to me.  I've seen it many times.

Q.  And that's written by doctors Larson, Haag, and Silvette, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  And it's a book that reports on or summarizes 6,000 articles on experimental and clinical smoking and other health-related studies?

A.  True.

Q.  And basically it was a collection of

scientific research and articles that had been published, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q. And in this book doctors Larson, Haag, and Silvette, they didn't editorialize, it just summarizes and provides the 6,000 studies?

A.  Well, they editorialized a little bit in it but there aren't really � they didn't try to draw conclusions from the studies for the most part, but there are some summary comments.

Q.  And this book was funded by the tobacco industry, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee, correct?

A.  Sure, Haag and Larson were, you know, essentially paid for my American Tobacco.  It goes back to 1939, Dr. Haag was under the employ of

17 American Tobacco, and Larson was hired with money

from American Tobacco to work at the Medical College of Virginia.

Q.  And so when you talk about the Tobacco Industry Research Committee starting in the 1950s, the Plaza Hotel meeting, it was that Tobacco Industry Research Committee that funded and financed this book?

A.  They did pay for the publication of the

book, yes.

Q.  And the Surgeon General said in 1964, that this was a key research tool for the committee that they put together that was doing all the research on smoking, right?

A.  Sure, it was a reference tool that they used and I think they mentioned they cited rather than going back and use the � do the review literature up to 1958, they relied on the papers in that book.

Q.  So this book was so comprehensive in summarizing 6,000 studies over the years that the Surgeon General thought:  We don't need to go back and read everything.  We'll look at the summaries here?

A.  Well, it was a reference.  I mean it was a list of bibliography.  Most of it was irrelevant to smoking and health, but certainly the committee did utilize it up to 1958, and then they did their literature searches from '59 forward on the National Library of Medicine.

Q.  And the Surgeon General said that one of their primary duties was obviously reviewing all of the available information about smoking and health?

Q.  And they said that when it came to that,
	

they said the first and most important was this
	

bibliography that was published known as the Green
	

Monster, correct?
	

A.  They didn't say it was the most
	

important but they said certainly they did use
	

it.
	

Q.  And, in fact, the 1964 Surgeon General's
	

report thanked, right, the tobacco companies for
	

providing the Larson, Haag, and Silvette book,
	

right?
	

A.  Yes, they did.
	

Q.  Now you agree that a lot of the TIRC and
	

the CTR that the industry funded research was
	

excellent science?
	

A.  It was excellent basic science, yes.
	

Q.  And certainly you agree that the TIRC
	

and CTR, they funded some of the country's top
	

scientists?
	

A.  They did, Nobel Prize winners.
	

Q.  And all of the money that came from CTR
	

and the TIRC, that came from the tobacco
	

companies, including the defendants here?
	

A.  Yes.

Q.  And some of the scientists that the tobacco companies would fund were also getting at the same time money from the National Institutes of Health and government research agencies, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  So you had some projects that both the National Cancer Institute for the government and the tobacco companies, they were funding the same researchers and the same science?

A.  Yes, that's true.  You'll find that occasionally.

Q.  And you don't deny that the scientists that received grants, research grants from the TIRC and from CTR were very notable and outstanding in their field?

A.  I don't deny that most of the scientists that they funded were very good scientists.  I surveyed them, asked them about the research they were doing.

Q.  In fact, ten of the scientists that were funded by CTR went on to win the Nobel Prize, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you have in front of you, could you look at the demonstrative?

Q.  All right.

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, permission to just put this up on the � this demonstrative list of the Nobel Prize winners, not in evidence. THE COURT:  You can do that.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  And when we say TIRC and CTR, again, these are the industry research organizations who are giving money to scientists to do research, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And here is ten of them that won the Nobel Prize including people from Harvard, from UCLA, and including, if we see Dr. Murad from Stanford and was the chief of medicine for the VA for the government?

A.  Sure.  Actually Harold Varmus is the head of the National Cancer Institute today.

Q.  All right.  And the Nobel Prize is probably the highest honor that a scientist can get?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And you're not claiming the work by those Nobel Prize winners was fraudulent?

A.  No, it wasn't fraudulent, but it didn't have anything to do with smoking and health.

Q.  All right.  Well, we'll talk about that in a few moments.

A.  Sure.

Q.  You told the jury that you used to work at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute close to Buffalo, New York, right?

A.  Thirty-one years, yes.

Q.  And your former employer, Roswell Park, received CTR funding, right?

A.  They did.

Q.  And your former employer, where you used to work, Roswell Park, got funding all the way from around the early '50s to 1992, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And so was your former employer part of the conspiracy?

A.  Well, they now know that they were. They didn't know that there was a conspiracy going on until the internal business records became available in the late 1990s to early 2000.

Q.  Well, did Roswell Park �

THE WITNESS: And actually some of that evidence did come out in a little bit earlier and that's why in 1992, Roswell Park had a policy not to take money from CTR after that time.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Did Roswell Park do fraudulent research from the '50s to the 1990s, when they got grant money?

A.  No.  Some of the research early on had to do with smoking and health and some of the funding was discontinued because of the findings that were coming out, now we know because of the internal business records of the company being revealed.

But much of the research funded by CTR including the research at Roswell Park had nothing to do with smoking and health.  As I pointed out, nine out of ten of the grants funded by CTR, the scientists themselves said � had nothing to do with smoking and health.

Q.  All right.  Let's talk about that.  You did a survey of some scientists who received grant

22 money from these organizations

MR. BELASIC:  And we can take that down, T ammy.

THE WITNESS:  Sure.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Right?

A.  Actually I've looked at all the grants that came to me, so I've not only done a survey, I had all of the grants that came to CTR because all the documents from CTR came to Roswell Park that I was involved in digitizing and studying.

Q.  So to save time, you understand my question was about the survey, right?

A.  Sure.

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Argumentative. THE COURT:  Overruled.  Let's stay focused.  Everybody stay focused on the question so we can move through this. Go ahead.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  I'd like to get you out of here as soon as possible.  So my question is only about your survey.  You surveyed the scientists who got grants from CTR and TIRC?

A.  That's right.

Q. And you have estimated in the past there was about 1100 scientists over these many decades who got those grants, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And only 77 of those 1100 responded to your survey?

Q.  I didn't ask you when, sir.  Can you listen to my question?  Only 77 of the 1100 scientists even responded to your survey; is that right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Now the Surgeon General, I think you've explained, he doesn't � the Surgeon General himself doesn't write these reports by himself, right?

A.  No.

Q. So he has groups of advisors, experts, peer reviewers, who write the report and review the material in the report, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q. And so the Surgeon General has his own peer review group who looks at the science, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And it's those experts that the Surgeon General hires who decide what evidence to put in the report and what scientific research to cite or use as a basis for the conclusions, correct?

A.  Sure.

from CTR, from the tobacco groups, they published thousands of articles in scientific journals, correct?

A.  Yeah, about 6,000.

Q.  And many or most of those 6,000 were published in peer-reviewed journal where a group of experts would determine whether it was reliable enough to publish, right?

A.  Yes, that's true.

Q.  And of those � of the scientific research that was funded by the tobacco companies, the Surgeon General and their � and the experts for those committees, they used and relied upon 6 or 700 different published articles, right?

A.  About 600 out of the 6,000.  So about ten percent.

Q.  So 600 different scientific studies published by scientists who received tobacco money were reviewed by the Surgeon General and determined to be reliable enough to put in the Surgeon General's report?

A.  That had to do with smoking and health. So they were contained in the reviews of the Surgeon General.  So consistent with about 10 percent of the studies having to do with smoking

Q.  We were talking about polls earlier and I think it was yesterday that you told Mr. Bass about a Roper Poll or that the industry sometimes uses the Roper Organization for surveys?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And the Surgeon General has always reviewed Roper Polls, correct?

A.  That's true.

Q.  And the Federal Trade Commission, they've actually paid money to hire Roper to do their own polls as well, correct?

A.  I'm not sure they paid Roper.  I know that they received the polls from the companies in the '81 report as well as Gallup and some of the other polling agencies when they produced that 1981 report.

Q.  Okay.  And you're familiar with a 1959 Roper Survey that asked the question:  Who would you be most apt to believe if one of these organizations said there was no connection whatsoever between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, correct?

he's moving the page o

that demonstrative.
		
	

THE

demonstrative.

MR. BELASIC:  ARN5043, that's the 1959 Roper Survey.  Can we now show the answer? (Defendants' Exhibit ARN5043 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So 1959, Ms. Cooper was eight years old, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And in 1959, Ms. Cooper had not even smoked a cigarette, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And so they asked people:  Who would you be most apt to believe if one of these organizations said there was no connection whatsoever between lung cancer and cigarette smoking?

And only three percent of the people surveyed said that they would be most apt to believe the Tobacco Industry Research Council.

Thirty-nine percent said the American Cancer Society, and 20 percent each said the AMA and the U.S. Department of Health, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  All right.  So that was � three percent thought the tobacco companies were the most credible source at that point?

THE COURT:  In evidence out of order. (Defendants' Exhibit AN2641 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So this is '68, and, it's again this national survey, right? A.  That's right.

Q.  And in 1968, Mary Cooper was 17 years old, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  That's the year that she graduated from high school?

A.  Right.

Q.  It's the year she got married? A.  Right.

4 showed them different sources?

5      A.  Sure.

7 most reliable, which one or two?  Would you look

8 down this list and tell me which one � it should

9 be one or two, would you consider the most

11 health?

14 three percent said that the tobacco companies were

General's report used a scientific definition of addiction, correct?

A.  Right, they adopted the World Health Organization definition.

Q.  So the Surgeon General back in '64, back in 1964, they used the scientific definition of addiction from the WHO, the World Health Organization?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And the definition of addiction then in 1964, that they used, required that the drug be intoxicating?

A.  Among other things, yes.

Q.  And so one of the reasons that they said that smoking wouldn't meet the scientific definition of addiction is that smoking wasn't intoxicating?

A.  Well, that was one reason.

Q.  Okay.

A.  Not knowing about the physiologic �

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, I've asked him about that reason.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  So shortly thereafter, the WHO changed its definition of addiction, correct?

A.  True.

Q.  Five years later in 1969, the Surgeon General was Dr. Stuart?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And Dr. Stuart told Congress that the Surgeon General's position was still the same, that they classified smoking as a habituation and not an addiction?

A.  Yes, they hadn't updated that chapter. That's what he was basically saying.

Q.  And in 1988, we talked about this yesterday, and you talked about it with Mr. Bass. In 1988, the Surgeon General's report declared smoking to be addictive, right?

A. Yeah, that report was on why people smoke, so it was the first of the reports to revisit the issue.

Q.  My question was:  In 1988, the Surgeon General's report declared smoking was addictive, right?

A.  Yes.

A.  Right, they used the accepted definition at that time.

Q.  My question to you is:  The definition that the Surgeon General used in 1988, did not require intoxication, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Now when you showed the jury the testimony of the companies, when they were in front of Congress, right �

A.  Okay.

Q.  � and the question was asked by Congressman Wyden, a congressman I think from Oregon?

A.  Yes, now a senator.

Q.  The question was:  Do you consider nicotine addictive, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  And the first person that answered that question was Jim Johnston, right?

A.  No, I think he was the second one.

24 Mr. Campbell was the first one from Philip Morris,

and Mr. Johnston from RJ Reynolds.

Q.  All right.  So I represent Reynolds. I'm going to ask you about what Jim Johnston said when he was asked that question.

As you saw, Jim Johnston, when he was asked said that smoking and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic definition of addiction, and than he said, there's no intoxication.  That's how he started, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And then Congressman Wyden cut him off and said:  I want a yes or no answer?

A.  No, what he said is:  We already have your written testimony that you've given on this topic.  We just want to know going down the row from each of you whether cigarettes are addictive, yes or no.

Q.  Yes or no, and so �

A.  Because he had already had the testimony from Mr. Johnston.

Q.  And so when Mr. Johnston was explaining, he said he was talking about the classic definition of addiction, he said:  Which requires intoxication?

A.  He did.

MR. BELASIC:  All right.  Your Honor,

plaintiffs played a portion, and we now request the opportunity to play additional testimony from

3 Hr. Johnston.

4           THE COURT:  You can do that

5            (Video clip played as follows:)

6           VOICE:  Good morning, Mr. Chairman,

7 [members of the subcommittee.  Again, I am Jim Johnston, chairman and chief executive of the

9 office of the RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company.

10           I think the subcommittee should also be

11 aware that Dr. Kessler's definition of addiction

12 would classify most coffee, cola, and tea drinkers

13 as addicts, caffeine addicts.

14           Many people experience a strong urge for

15 a cup of coffee each morning, and there is a well

16 documented physical withdrawal syndrome associated

17 with the consumption of coffee and caffeinated

18 soft drinks

19           Nonetheless, I seriously doubt that the

20 American public would say that these

characteristics put caffeine in the same class as addictive drugs such as cocaine and heroin.

During the past several years, there have been a wide variety of attempts to convince the American public that cigarettes are addictive

and that some public officials have even gone so far as to put cigarettes in the same class as cocaine and heroin.

You don't need to be a trained scientist to see this isn't true. All you need to do is ask and honestly answer two simple questions.

First, would you rather board a plane with a pilot who just smoked a cigarette or one with a pilot who just had a couple of beers or snorted cocaine or shot heroin or popped some pills.

Second, if cigarettes were addictive, could almost 43 million Americans have quit smoking almost all of them on their own without any outside help?

The answers are obvious, and that is precisely my point.  Cigarettes are clearly not in the same class as addictive, mind-altering drugs like heroin and cocaine.

I agree that for some people cigarette smoking is habit-forming, in the same way that other pleasurable activities such as watching TV, eating your favorite foods, sometimes overeating your favorite foods, and drinking coffee can be habit-forming.

And, yes, some smokers find it difficult to quit, but there is nothing about cigarette smoking that prevents a person from clearly thinking and making reasoned decisions including the decision to quit.

A.  The testimony in front of Congress with

19 Mr. Wyden was.

Q.  Right.  And when you reviewed her sworn testimony, she never said under oath:  I saw that? Never claimed it?

A.  I don't think she was asked, as I recall.

Q.  So if she says she saw it in this trial,

it would be the first time that she's made that claim?

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Mischaracterizes testimony.

THE WITNESS:  If she's asked � THE COURT:  Hang on, sir. THE WITNESS:  Sure.

THE COURT:  I'll let him answer the question.  Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Based on my recollection of the transcript, I don't think she was asked. Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right. A.  So I guess it would have been the first time she would have been asked.  I didn't ask it.

Q.  Why not?

A. It wasn't relevant to my assessment of whether she was addicted or not, which is why I was conducting the interview.

Q.  Well, Dr. Cummings, you testified for several hours about your opinions about what Ms. Cummings � what Ms. Cooper knew, and you told

23 Mr. Bass � Mr. Bass was asking you questions:

Did she rely on what companies said?  Was she deceived.

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Asked and answered.

THE COURT:  Overruled.  You can answer.

THE WITNESS:  I didn't ask and she didn't claim it.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So let me ask you about something else.  Are National Cancer Institute monographs sort of similar to Surgeon General's reports?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And the National Cancer Institute is a federal agency from the National Institutes of Health, right?

A.  It is.

A.  Correct.  I've done monographs.  I've edited monographs for them.

Q.  And they finance research?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And we've already said some of the research they financed was also financed at the same time by tobacco companies?

A.  True.

Q.  All right.  Now you participated, you contributed to monograph 15 that was published in, was it 2002?

A.  Yes.

Q.  So 2002, that was the year after

15 Ms. Cooper quit smoking, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And one of the things that the National Cancer Institute was looking at then was trying to determine whether the population of what they called residual smokers, and that means the people who keep smoking �

A.  That's right.

Q.  � the National Cancer Institute was trying to determine if the people who keep smoking were more addicted than the people who had, say,

smoked in the '80s and '90s, right?

A.  People who had quit versus those who were persisting in smoking.

Q.  And the conclusion was of the National Cancer Institute was that there wasn't much difference in addiction between the people that continued smoking and the people who had smoked and quit, correct?

A.  Yeah.  For the most part, that's true on the measures that they used, which were fairly limited.

Q. And one of the measures they used was the same measure you used with Ms. Cooper, the time to your first cigarette, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And the National Cancer Institute concluded that using that measure and others, that there was little difference in addiction between the people who quit and the people who were still smoking?

A.  It hadn't changed much.

Q.  Okay.  You talked some about inhalability.  Do you remember yesterday we put up the 1906 Florida Health Notes that said cigarette smoking is widely regarded as the worst form of

tobacco addiction?

A.  Yeah.

Q.  And in 1906, that Florida Health Department note said that one of the reasons it was the worst form of addiction is that it was readily inhalable, right?

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  In 1906, that was before the commercial cigarettes were even being made, right?

A.  Yeah.  Most cigarettes at that time were Turkish blend which were inhalable because they didn't have a lot of nicotine.

MR. BELASIC:  Well, Your Honor, I'm going to ask once again if the witness could answer the question.

THE COURT:  Start again.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  1906 was before commercial factory cigarettes like Salems and Kools were even being made, right?

A.  Well, there were commercial cigarettes, but it was before Kool and Salem.

Q.  Well, for example, my client, RJ Reynolds, they didn't start making Camels until 1913, correct?

A.  Right, because they were part of

MR. BELASIC:  Again, Your Honor, this has nothing to do with the question.

THE COURT:  A agree.  I sustain the objection.  Strike the last part of the answer. Start again.  Everybody stay focused. Go ahead, Mr. Belasic. Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Simple question, let's just go back, 1906, Florida State Department of Health says that they recognize that smoking is addictive and it's readily inhalable? A.  Right.

Q.  Okay.  Now could you look at AWS58?  I think we gave you a copy.  No, okay.  It's here. MR. BASS:  Thank you. THE WITNESS:  Okay. Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Now, Dr. Cummings, if you could turn to the second page � A.  Okay.

Q.  Okay.  That's before RJ Reynolds was even making cigarettes?

A.  Right.  Chewing tobacco.

Q.  Can we go to the first highlighted page? Do you see at the top that this medical journal from 1887, is talking about something called the Ninth International Medical Congress, which was a conference of doctors? A.  Yes.

MS. THERIOT:  Yes. Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  So in the 100-year-old medical journal, it talks about what was discussed at the Ninth International Medical Congress in Washington? A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  And do you see at the top, the deleterious effects of tobacco on the throat and nose, and a professor gave his remarks and said he considered smoking far more injurious to these parts than chewing, right? A.  Right.

Q.  And then could you highlight � just highlight that.

It says:  Cigarette smoking is especially injurious because the smoke is so universally inhaled, causing pharyngitis, laryngitis, and chronic irritation in the nose,

not to mention the injury it may occasion to trachea and lungs.

So in 1887, this professor at the International Medical Conference in Washington, D.C., was saying that the smoke was universally inhaled?

A.  That's what he says.

Q.  You talked yesterday a bit about filters.  So let's talk for a few minutes about filters.

A.  Okay.

Q.  We already agree Ms. Cooper always smoked them?

A.  Yes.

Q.  She was never an unfiltered smoker who had to decide or make a switch?

A.  No, I think we established that yesterday beyond a doubt.

Q.  All right.  So in the '60s and the '70s and the '80s, when Mary Cooper was smoking, the Surgeon General was encouraging smokers to quit to filters or low-tar cigarettes, correct?

A.  Based on the information they had.

Q.  And the American Cancer Society in the '60s, '70s, and '80s, was doing the same thing,

encouraging smokers to switch to filters or low tar?

A.  Actually they were encouraging smokers to quit, but if they couldn't quit, said you should go to a filter or low-tar cigarette.

Q.  And the public health community was encouraging the development of filters or low-tar cigarettes?

A.  Well, they were studying them.  They weren't encouraging the development of cigarettes at all, not the Public Health Service.

Q.  When you talk about studying them, the Surgeon General wrote many times over the years about their review of the scientific evidence on filters and low tar, correct?

A.  Sure.

Q. And not just on filters and low tar, but on what happened to the people who smoked filters and low tar?

A.  Right, summarized in the most recent report.

Q.  And so, for example, one of the things, one of the things that the Surgeon General would look at over the years while Ms. Cooper was smoking is the lung cancer rates of people who

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Let's look at the '81 Surgeon General's report.  It was called the Changing Cigarette?

A.  Correct.

Do you have a copy of that?

Q.  And one of the things the Surgeon General was looking at here was the lung cancer rates of people who smoke filters and low-tar cigarettes, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  If you go to page 18, and this was in the conclusion section up front, and this was their first conclusion on cancer:  Today's filter-tipped, lower tar and nicotine cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer than do their higher tar and nicotine predecessors.

Nonetheless, smokers of lower tar and nicotine cigarettes have much higher lung cancer incidence and mortality than do nonsmokers. I read that correctly?

A.  You read it correctly.

Q.  Now my question is, the Surgeon General, when he says produced lower rates of lung cancer, they were looking at the actual rates of lung cancer in actual smokers, not mice, right?

	A.
	No, that's true.  There were
	

epid
	emiologic studies.  These are the human cancer
		
stud
	ies
	mostly of a case control nature,
	and they

were
	th
	e early groups of people who had
	switched

to f

	ers because really filters had ta
	ken off in

the
	'50
	s, been widely adopted by the '60
	s and

	�

	, the

ques

and
	not
	mice?

cancer
		they got, right, not mice?

	True, but they also looked at mice in
	
this
	re
	port.

THE COURT:  It is argumentative.
	

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  When they looked at
	

the lung cancer rates of the people who smoked
	

filter and low tar, they had lower rates of lung
	

cancer than the people who smoked other types of
	

cigarettes?
	

A.  Sure, based on the studies they had at
	

the time.
	

Q.  But those were studies of actual people
	

looking at the rates of lung cancer that were
	

reported?
	

A.  Sure.
	

Q.  It wasn't a laboratory test?
	

A.  No.
	

Q.  Okay.
	

A.  It didn't have � well, it was only
	

based on the published scientific literature.
	

Q.  Well, what it was based on was the lung
	

cancer rates of actual smokers, right?
	

A.  Sure, in the published scientific
	

literature.
	

Q.  So in 1982, the Surgeon General's report
	

also discussed this issue?
	

A.  Yeah.

MR. BELASIC:  And the same thing, Your Honor, I would move in a portion of the 1982 Surgeon General's report, AS29.

THE COURT:  All right.  It will be in evidence and the same ruling will apply to all the Surgeon General reports.

MR. BASS:  All right.

THE COURT:  We'll deal with them outside the presence of the jury.

(Defendants' Exhibit AS29 was received in evidence.)

MR. BELASIC:  Can you call up the page, T ammy ?

(Hands document.)

THE WITNESS:  Thank you. Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  And so you agree this is the 1982 Surgeon General's report? A.  It's a part of it.

Q.  Okay.  And the Surgeon General says here in 1982, again:  Filtered lower tar cigarette smokers have a lower lung cancer risk compared to nonfiltered, higher tar cigarette smokers.

However, the risk for these smokers is still substantially elevated above the risk of nonsmokers.

And I have the same question:  The evidence that the Surgeon General is looking at here is comparing the actual lung cancer rates of people who smoke filters and low tars compared to the lung cancer in people who smoke other cigarettes?

A.  Right.  It's the same evidence that they had in '81.

Q.  And in 1990, the Surgeon General again reported on this issue?

A.  Yeah.  It's been reported in every report since.

MR. BELASIC:  And, Your Honor, I would

14 move a portion of the 1990 Surgeon General's

report in.  It's AS36.

THE COURT:  Same ruling.  In evidence. (Defendants' Exhibit AS36 was received in evidence.)

MR. BELASIC:  And so can we just keep the front page up, Tammy, there?

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  So the 1990, the Health Benefits of Smoking Cessation, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Here the Surgeon General comments on different tobacco products. The report says:  Differences in the reduction in risk following cessation have also been investigated by types of cigarettes smoked.

It says:  A lower risk of lung cancer has been observed for smokers of filtered cigarettes compared with smokers of nonfiltered cigarettes.

And it says, U.S., and that's the Department of Health and Human Services?

A.  Right, it's citing the '82 report you just showed.

Q.  And the '89 report, correct?

A.  True.

Q.  And it's citing a study by Dr. Wynder, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And those studies and those reports looked at actual smokers and the actual rates of cancer that they got, correct?

A.  Yes.

A.  Yeah.

Q.  All right.  Now whether it was filtered or unfiltered or lights, isn't it true that the warning that occurred in 1966, it was the same on all packs?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  The warning wasn't different or lesser for light cigarettes, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  And when Ms. Cooper was told by Dr. Shapiro that she had to quit smoking after they removed polyps, benign polyps from her vocal cords �

A.  Right.

Q.  � you agree she didn't tell him: Doctor, I smoke lights, so I don't need to quit. She didn't say that?

A.  I don't know what she said to him.

Q.  Okay.  Well, you do know, right, because it's in your notes, that she said she would try to quit, right?

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  Let's talk some things about cigarette design, right, and the tobacco plant naturally that grows in the ground has thousands of chemicals inside it, right?

A.  Yes, not naturally though.  Some of them because of the fertilizers, they get metals and so on, so it's not natural.  There are additives that are put even into the ground.

Q.  But even if there wasn't any fertilizer,

even hundreds of years ago when the Native

had thousands of chemicals that occurred naturally inside it?

A.  Not thousands.  You get the thousands when you burn it.

Q.  Right.  So if you set tobacco on fire, even if you don't have fertilizer or anything else, when you set tobacco on fire, it's going to produce chemicals in the smoke, right?

A.  True.

Q.  Some of those chemicals are called polycyclic hydrocarbons?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And the polycyclic hydrocarbons are some of the carcinogens that they found in tobacco smoke, right?

A.  One class, yes.

Q. And it's not possible to remove all of those compounds from smoke, right, when you set tobacco on fire?

A.  That's what was determined by the companies.

Q.  All right.  Now if I went out and I collected weeds outside and I set them on fire,

there would be chemicals in the smoke, correct? A.  Sure.

Q.  And there would be polycyclic hydrocarbons in the smoke?

A.  Right, it's a byproduct of burning. Q.  And if people scooped up a lot of leaves out of their yard in September or October and made a big bonfire of the leaves, there would be carcinogens in the smoke?

A.  Right.  We wouldn't tell people to be inhaling it into their lungs.

MR. BELASIC:  Can we go to the highlighted area?

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  And this was a yearly planning memo.  He told them what he considered some top priorities for the next year, correct?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And he had a category that he wrote to Dr. Senkus, Areas of Special Emphasis, and do you see number 1, it says:  In cooperation with others, you should push the work concerning tobacco and health.

You should prepare a plan to foster any relationship with government personnel in the quest for mutual understanding of facts ultimately to gain their cooperation in proper research of the subject.

And then, 2, if there is a "safer cigarette," let's continue and increase our efforts in this program.

Please prepare a plan to carry it out. And that was from the top executive at Reynolds to the top scientist at Reynolds?

A.  Right.

Q. And it was widely known then that the government was about to form something in 1968 called the Tobacco Working Group, right?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And the Tobacco Working Group was, I don't know if you'd call it a joint venture, but it included both the government scientists and representatives from the tobacco companies, correct?

A.  And academic scientists.

A.  True.

Q.  They were in charge; they published research, et cetera?

A.  They did.

Q.  And the National Cancer Institute had a division called or a group called The Less Hazardous Cigarette Program, right?

Program?

A.     To develop a less hazardous cigarette.

A.  Correct.

Q.  And this meeting was about the high nicotine/tar, low-tar cigarettes, correct?

A.  True.

Q.  And I know it's more complex than that, but would you agree basically they were looking at whether a cigarette that had low tar but higher nicotine might be safer?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Okay.  And the attendees, we see Dr. Gio Gori.  He was in charge of The Less Hazardous Cigarette Program for the government, right, the National Cancer Institute?

A.  Correct.

Q.  And we see that Dr. Hughes from Brown &

16 Williamson was there?

A.     Yes.

Q.     And Dr. Osdene at Philip Morris?

A.     Correct.

Q.     And Dr. Senkus from Reynolds?

A.     Yes.

Q.     Dr. Spears from Lorillard?

A.     Yes.

Q.     Those were the top scientists?

A.     Yes.

A.  That's right.

Q.  And the United States Department of

Group, correct?

A.  They were.

Q.  And the Tobacco Working Group and the government, they were using the U.S. Department of

of tobacco?

A.  True.

Q.  And is it fair to say that over the nine years, from '68 to '77, the government and this Tobacco Working Group, they looked at a lot of different types of tobacco that could be grown or cross-bred or genetically changed somehow, right?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And they relied in part on the expertise of Dr. Tso, who was in charge of that group at the government's Department of Agriculture?

A.  True.

Q.  All right.  So let's go to the next page and see Purpose of the Meeting.

And Dr. Gori asked the consultants to consider the feasibility of producing a cigarette that yielded a tar/nicotine ratio below ten.

Since nicotine may play a significant role as a determinant of smoking behavior and it also contributes to the organoleptic qualities of the smoke.

That's like taste and smell, correct? A.  Sensory effects, yes.

Q. He says: It is necessary to consider this additional approach to the less hazardous cigarette.

And he said:  I.e., a low tar/nicotine ratio, low tar cigarette.

Is that what we were talking about before, a cigarette with low tar, but it would have higher levels of nicotine than normal?

A.  Correct, below the usual ratio of ten. Q.  And so there's no question from this

20 meeting that the government's National Cancer

Institute Less Hazardous Cigarette Program was looking at whether a low tar, higher nicotine cigarette could be safe � or safer?  Obviously it wouldn't be safe. A.  True.

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

2200

1      Q.  Look at the next paragraph on

2 Feasibility and Desirability.

3           Do you see it says:  It was the

4 consensus of the group that an effort to produce

5 these cigarette, test cigarettes with tar/nicotine

6 ratios of less than ten is valuable and should be

7 conducted.

8           And then he says:  In view of the

9 manipulatory potential of reconstituted sheet

10 technology, such cigarettes are feasible.

11           And isn't it true that one of the ways

12 the federal government and the Tobacco Working

13 Group was looking at to make a possibly, possibly

14 less hazardous cigarette was using reconstituted

15 tobacco sheet to get more nicotine and less tar?

16      A.  That was one of the methods that were

17 discussed.  There were others.

18      Q.  And the next paragraph, it says:  The

19 source of the nicotine was questioned.  Dr. Tso �

20 he was the agricultural department government �

21 the government man � stated that the source could

22 be a high nicotine tobacco variety.

23           The maximum nicotine content is seven

24 percent, and although such tobacco also produces a

25 great deal of tar, it could serve as a nicotine

source.

The tar is not a problem if such tobacco is stripped and suitable quantities of the removed nicotine are added back to a modified tobacco sheet.

So, again, the government's Less Hazardous Cigarette Program is talking about using reconstituted tobacco sheet and basically altering the ratio between tar and nicotine, correct?

A.  Sure, in experiments.

Q.  Right.

And they're doing this research and these experiments, Dr. Tso and Dr. Gori, with the goal of seeing if it could reduce the risks of smoking?

A.  True.

Q.  Okay.  Let's look at the methods they looked at.  They discussed using special tobacco; is that right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And they discussed using modified tobacco sheet technology, and that's talking about the reconstituted tobacco that they roll out into a sheet like paper?

A.  Right.

Q.  All right.  Look at the next paragraph. You talked about pH yesterday and changing the smoke from acidic, meaning acid, to a base.

A.  Right.

Q.  And here, just to cut to the chase, the government's Less Hazardous Cigarette Program is discussing looking at different ways to either alter the pH or to alter the form of nicotine, correct?

A.  Right.

Q.  And, again, it's with the goal of seeing if those cigarettes could be less hazardous?

A.  True.

Q.  The next one, it says:  Dr. Gori even looked at the � and, again, Dr. Gori was in charge of the program for the government?

A.  That's right.

Q.  He even looked at the possibility of putting metallic fibers in the tobacco so you could increase the temperature of smoke.  Maybe that would make it safer, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  The idea was maybe you could burn off some of the chemicals that were normally produced

in smoke?

A.  Changing the burn temperature would alter the delivery of the product and actually some of the byproducts as well.  Palladium was one of the things that Liggett looked at.

Q.  Okay.  Go to the last page.

And here is where Dr. Gori sets out a protocol, basically meaning the tasks that they should do and the research that they should do.

A.  Well, I think this was all of the group that attended, not just Dr. Gori.

Q.  All right.  So Dr. Gori, the people from the tobacco companies, the people from the Department of Agriculture?

A.  Right.

Q.  And they said one of the issues was to isolate the nicotine and add it back later, it said, or use a commercial nicotine salt; is that right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  It says you should determine the nicotine, the tar, and the pH?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And if you look right at the last sentence, they even concluded that it might be

desirable to attempt to increase the pH or decrease the pH, right?

A.  Correct, depending on the tobacco you're using.

Q.  Now over the course of nine years, the Tobacco Working Group, between the government scientists and the tobacco scientists, they produced hundreds of alternative cigarettes that they tested, correct?

A.  True.

Q.  And they published that research, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  It wasn't kept secret?

A.  No.

Q.  And it was in four large volumes, hundreds of pages, maybe it's more than a thousand pages, of their results on the different types of cigarettes that they tried to make, right?

A.  Yeah.  The Banbury Report is really a summary of the findings from the Tobacco Working Group, and then the '81 Surgeon General's report.

Q.  And they researched cigarettes that used some of those methods, correct?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Cigarettes that had low tar but had disproportionately higher nicotine?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Cigarettes where you would take � you would add back nicotine from the reconstituted sheet?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And cigarettes where you would alter pH?

A.  They did.

Q.  And ultimately the government terminated the program in 1977 or '78; is that right?

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  Now during this time, the '60s and '70s, the tobacco companies helped do some of the research that the government was talking about, part of the program, their scientists?

A.  Well, they supplied most of the tobacco because the government doesn't make cigarettes. So they were actually the only group that was capable of really creating the test cigarettes that were used in these experiments.

Q.  And there are research documents, there are documents from the R&D departments from RJ Reynolds in the '60s and '70s that show research on these types of methods, correct?

A.  Sure, actually before and after and during.

Q.  And the same thing for Lorillard; there's Lorillard R&D reports that would show they researched these types of things?

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, I'd move into evidence AM593, the letter from the National Cancer Institute.

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Hearsay. MR. BELASIC:  It's a business record of the National Cancer Institute, Your Honor.  It's also more than 20 years old.

THE COURT:  Okay.  As to hearsay grounds, it's overruled.  It will be in evidence. (Defendants' Exhibit AM593 was received in evidence.)

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  So the date is 1977.  I guess that's around the time that the government ended the program, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And let's look who it was from.  James Peters was the director of the division of cancer cause and cancer prevention?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And so the director of cancer cause and cancer prevention was writing to Dr. Rodgman.  You told the jury about Dr. Rodgman, the chemist at Reynolds?

A.  Right.

Q.  And he said:  It is with regret that I

1 must inform you of the termination of the Tobacco

2 Working Group of which you are a member.

3           And he says:  From time to time, the

4 government and the department find it necessary to

5 reorganization the advisory committee structure.

6 This often results in the termination of some

7 outside advisory groups.  Such is the case for the

8 Tobacco Working Group.

9           And then he says:  I would like to take

10 the opportunity to express my thanks and the

11 appreciation of the National Cancer Institute,

12 right?

13      A.  Yeah.

14      Q.  And he describes Rodgman or Reynolds'

15 work as, quote, a substantial contribution to the

16 committee, correct?

17      A.  He thanks him for his contribution,

18 yeah, not Reynolds.  I think his contribution.

19      Q.  And he describes Mr. Rodgman's or

20 Dr. Rodgman's contribution as substantial?

21      A.  Yes.

22      Q.  Let's talk a little more about

23 reconstituted tobacco.  Reconstituted tobacco does

24 come from different parts of the tobacco plant,

25 correct?

13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23

25

2209

A.  Yes, some of it.

Q.  Bits of leaves, the stalk, the stems, correct?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And you'd agree that the use of reconstituted tobacco sheet, like you showed the jury it's rolled out in a sheet, has been known for a very long time?

A.  Sure.

Q.  Reader's Digest, we talked about that yesterday, they wrote it up in the 1950s and

reconstituted tobacco sheet?

A. Well, it was a brief mention in one of their articles, yes.

Q.  And the Surgeon General has commented and reviewed information on reconstituted tobacco sheet over the years?

A. Sure. I think the '81 report compares the biological activity of recon versus regular tobacco.

Q. And one of the things that the Surgeon General's report, the 1981 report that you

24 mentioned, said was that reconstituted tobacco

sheet in animal experiments had less biological

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=1002
10 mutagenicity is a good thing?

11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

2210

activity than other smoke, right?

A. Yeah. It depends on what sheet you're looking at, but experiments that were reported, yes, showed less, you know, carcinogenicity.

Q.  And all things being equal, less carcinogenicity is a good thing when you're using � when you're making cigarettes, right?

A.  It's a very good thing.

Q.  And all things being equal, less

A.  Absolutely.

Q.  And the Surgeon General determined that reconstituted tobacco sheet, as used in the cigarettes around '81, did have lower carcinogenicity, right?

A.  Yeah, some of it did.

Q.  And lower mutagenicity?

A.  Some of it did.

Q.  And you know that the 1979 Surgeon General's report had an extensive section on different types of cigarette designs, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  And you've seen � just to save time, they had a large chart in the 1979 Surgeon General's report where they showed different types

of design from filters to different types of tobacco, correct?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And they included reconstituted tobacco sheet, right?

A.  They did.

Q.  And, once again, in that '79 chart, the Surgeon General determined that it reduced carcinogenicity, right?

A.  It was lower than just regular tobacco chopped up.

Q.  So reconstituted tobacco has lower cancer-causing potential?

A.  Well, some does; some doesn't.  It depends on the type of tobacco and what's going in and what's added to the recon.  So you can't just

17 make that sweeping statement.  It depends on how

it's constructed.

Q.  But in '79 and '81 when the Surgeon General looked at the cigarettes that were being

21 made, they determined that reconstituted tobacco

sheet had those characteristics, less carcinogenicity?

A.  They reported the studies in the literature at the time that were comparing

different types of reconstituted tobacco, yes.

Q.  And the cigarettes with reconstituted tobacco sheet have less nicotine in the tobacco than cigarettes with � that have no reconstituted tobacco sheet?

A.  Not necessarily.

Q.  All right.  You'd agree that only a small � only a certain portion of the tobacco in any given brand is reconstituted tobacco sheet, correct?

A.  That's true.

Q.  And it varies from brand to brand?

A.  That's right.

Q.  It might be 5 or 10 percent in some brands, 20 or 30 percent in others?

A.  And it's varied over time in the same brand.

Q.  And, in general, over the years, you'd agree that the reconstituted tobacco sheet process, the process you showed, the tobacco ends up with less nicotine than when it started?

A.  Generally that is true, although you can augment by adding extra nicotine, and there were programs to augment.  I think we just talked about it.

Q.  So when the Surgeon General looked at the effect of reconstituted sheet on tar and nicotine, it � those reports concluded that reconstituted tobacco sheet had less nicotine and less tar; is that right?

A.  I don't think there were conclusions in the report regarding that, but they did report some of the scientific studies, as I mentioned, that had for certain types of recon that had been evaluated, yeah, they were lower in biological activity.

Q.  And just so we can move along, can you agree it was � the 1979 Surgeon General's report is one report that looked at reconstituted tobacco sheet, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And then the other one you mentioned was the 1981 Surgeon General's report?

A.  Sure, and others.

Q.  So unless you want me to ask you a lot

21 more questions, I'll move on.  We've got other

ways of putting the evidence in.

All right.  Let me ask you:  You talked about pH yesterday � I think it was Tuesday or

We've just seen that the government was looking � or the government's Tobacco Working Group and the tobacco companies were looking at ways of altering pH with the goal of a safer cigarette?

A.  That's right.  That was one of the goals.

Q.  All right.  And you'd agree the idea of smoke pH, that has been known for decades, correct?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And just so we're clear, pH, it's not an ingredient that we're talking about; it's a

15 measure of something, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  Okay.  And pH, without getting into a lot of math, I mean pH is a measure of whether a liquid is acidic, has more acid, or whether it's a base?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And that's what we did in junior high school when they give us the little blue or pink strips, or they give us the strip, you put it in the water and it turns blue for one and pink for

the other?

A.  Yeah.  It's been a while since I've been there, but...

Q.  So the pH of different tobaccos can be different, correct �

A.  Yes.

Q.  � depending on the different type of tobacco?

A.  Well, that's one way that makes it different.

Q.  And pH can change depending on the crop cycle from year to year, correct?

A.  Sure.

Q.  If you have a drought or low rain, the pH can be different in the years where there's heavy rains?

A.  True.

Q.  And the amount of sugar in tobacco can determine pH, correct?

A.  Yes, how much is added in, that's true.

Q.  And Reynolds actually published not internally but actually published ways to measure pH; is that right?

A.  Sure, uh-huh.

Q.  And basically this was an article about a new technique to measure pH?

A.  In smoke.

Q.  In smoke.

MR. BELASIC:  All right.  You can take that down.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  The Surgeon General has talked about the pH of smoke and what its effect might be many times, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  And we talked about the 1979 Surgeon General's report where they reviewed some of the design characteristics, right?

A.  We did.

Q.  And in that 1979 Surgeon General's report, the Surgeon General wrote that the cigarettes in the United States had a pH level that resulted in very, very little free nicotine; isn't that right?

A. I'm not sure where you're at, but I don't recall that one specifically. I don't dispute it.

Q.  And as far as the effect on her, we're interested in the cigarettes during the time that she was smoking, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  Not the cigarettes of today or five years ago, right?

A.  Right.

Q.  And do you see it says:  Since cigarettes in the U.S. and in most foreign countries are made of flue-cured tobacco, are blends with flue-cured tobacco as a major ingredient, or in cases are blends with Turkish tobacco.

And that's the type of blends that were prevalent during that period, correct?

A.  No, it's one type of blend.  Bright tobacco is flue-cured for the most part.  Burley is generally air-cured, and Turkish is sun-cured. So they just take the leaves and leave them out for the sun to cure them.

Q.  And the Surgeon General's conclusion for cigarettes in the U.S. and most foreign countries are the pH of the resulting mainstream smoke is below 6.5 and, thus, essentially contained only protonated nicotine.

And that's � right? In other words, very little what you call free-base nicotine or the base?

A.  Well, actually 6.5 would actually provide a substantial amount of unprotonated � or protonated nicotine.  So it's actually quite high. So, yes, it's there.  They got it wrong in terms of their conclusion or their statement.

Q. So the Surgeon General in 1979 was wrong when it came to describing the cigarettes of that era?

A.  It was describing the amount of protonated nicotine or this free nicotine that's available in cigarettes, because cigarettes at 6.5 actually do deliver a fair amount of free nicotine.

Below 6 I would have agreed with the statement, but between 6 and 6.5, based on the internal business records of the company, based on their testing showed that there was much more free nicotine when you go above 6.0.

Q.  And my question was:  So the Surgeon General was wrong when the Surgeon General and all those peer reviewers put out this report?

A.  Yeah, apparently they were wrong.  They

didn't have access to the internal business records.

Q.  But they did tests on the commercial cigarettes, correct?

A.  They can only go based on what they know is in the scientific literature.

Q.  And for ten years they've been working with the tobacco companies to make a wide variety of cigarettes with different pH doing those tests and measuring pH themselves?

THE WITNESS:  Yes, only based on the published literature.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Again, my question was not about the published literature.  I'm simply asking you what the government did for those ten years when they were running all those tests.

Isn't it true that for ten years the Tobacco Working Group was running tests, making their own cigarettes, and determining pH levels?

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So this document is entitled The Review of Internal Reports Regarding Cigarette Smoke, pH, and Sales Trends, correct? A.  Correct.

Q. And have you gone through the pH levels for the brands that Ms. Cooper smoked during the years she smoked them?

A.  No.  I mean some of them are reported in internal business records, but the information on the brand formulas and so on is proprietary.  It's not available.

Q.  All right.  But you've seen this document for years now, correct?

A.  I have seen this document when it became available in the � after 2000.

brands that Ms. Cooper herself smoked, right? A.  Sure, uh-huh.

Q.  And this document shows the actual sales levels and compares it to the pH levels of smoke for the brands that Ms. Cooper smoked, right? A.  That's right.

Q.  And you know, from reviewing the charts in that document, that it shows that when pH went up, Salem sales went down.  When pH went down, Salem sales went down.

In fact, Salem sales went down throughout the entire period they measured it, correct?

A.  Incorrect.  Actually the chart shows that as pH went up, there was an uptake in the early part of the '70s.

And then Salem was aging out as a brand. It had attracted a lot of younger smokers early on, and it aged out, and those people �

started to decline and have continued to decline since that time, since the early '70s, mid '70s basically.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  So you haven't done this review yourself though of pH and sales for the brands that Ms. Cooper actually smoked, right?

A.  No, I have not gone and physically tested the brands of pH.  We didn't start doing that until 2002.

Q.  All right.  Let's look at what the summary was from this document.  And it says:  The history of smoke pH methodology is briefly summarized in this review, particularly regarding the many changes in methodology during the '60s and '7 0s.

There were changes in the ways to

17 measure it, correct.

A.  Sure.

Q.  And it says:  The various approaches to smoke pH measurements made comparisons over long periods of time difficult to interpret, because if you were measuring with different standards, it

23 might be apples and oranges, correct?

A.  Correct, I'd agree with that. Q.  And then it says:  In addition,

different researchers appeared to have different ideas of what was the most meaningful of the different smoke pH values that could be measured.

Let's look at the next paragraph.

And it says:  The chronology is important because an RJR research department finding in the early '70s that high smoke pH was a characteristic common to several competitive cigarette brands that were showing increasing sales trends.

And I think you may have showed us some of Dr. league's conclusions in the early '70s where he thought that their competitors, Marlboro, had pH levels, might be connected to sales, correct?

A.  Yeah, right.

Q.  And they say:  However, using a database that spans over a decade and is based on a consistent smoke pH test method, it appears that the sales trends of the '70s were not determined by smoke pH, despite the correlations reported.

From this review, the correlations of the early '70s appear to have been merely coincidental in nature, calculated at a time when certain cigarette brands were growing their market

share and their smoke pH happened to be relatively high.

There is no evidence from the historical data reviewed that the smoke pH of RJR brands was purposely increased to enhance sales.

Now did I read that correctly? A.  You read it correctly, but I don't agree with the statement.

Q.  And that document was an internal company document, correct? A.  Sure.

Q.  That's not a document that was written to be sent out to the public? A.  This one here? Q.  Right.  It's an internal document?

MR. BASS:  Objection.  Dr. Cummings can't know the meaning and intent of this 1996 document.

THE COURT:  Well, he's simply asking: Is it an internal document?

You can answer that.

THE WITNESS:  It's an internal document for legal purposes.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  So let's put that down.  I wanted to follow up on one thing

1 you said yesterday, Dr. Cummings.

2           You have talked about a � and we saw

3 and you showed the jury.  There was an episode of

4 the show Nightline in 1984.  An RJ Reynolds

5 president was on that, and it was Mr. Horrigan in

6 1984.

7      A.  Right.

8      Q.  And yesterday you told the jury that

9 Ms. Cooper's daughter Mechelle says that she

10 remembers seeing that TV show with her mom; is

11 that right?

12      A.  Yes.

13      Q.  Now her daughter would have been 14

14 years old in 1984 when this Nightline was on,

15 correct?

16      A.  That's correct.

17      Q.  And we've established it was on late at

18 night.  It started at 11:30, correct?

19      A.  Yes.

20      Q.  You read Mechelle, Ms. Cooper's

21 daughter's sworn testimony, correct?

22      A.  I did.

23      Q.  You read that she usually went to bed at

24 10:00, right?

25      A.  I don't dispute that.  I don't know.

That's consistent with somebody that age, yes.

Q.  That must have been an unusual night if she got to stay up late and they decided they would watch Nightline together at 11:30, right? MR. BASS:  Objection.  Speculation.

10 1984, right?

11      A.  That's right.

12      Q.  And you know from her testimony that she

13 always closed the lounge, meaning she was there

14 very late at night, right?

15      A.  Right.

16           MR. BASS:  Objection.  I think this was

If he doesn't object to the document, then I'll let you use the document, but I sent them out because of the pending question and the fear that you and he were getting ready to get into it in front of the jury.

You all can sit down if you want to. Everybody can stand if you want.  You all are welcome to sit.

MR. BELASIC:  I want to ask him and use that letter, if he doesn't agree, that just this year he had been advising lawyers before trial to find evidence of Nightline.

And that's because we believe the evidence on Nightline, for the reasons stated, is extremely peculiar and less than credible.

And it just so happens that this very witness, who is putting the Nightline charge in front of jury, is, now we know, telling lawyers in advance of trial:  Hey, Nightline is really good evidence.

MR. DAVIS:  And just from our perspective as well, it directly goes beyond whatever it may mean, and I'm not disagreeing with that in any way.  It's straight-up bias.

I mean we allowed testimony appropriately of his attendance at seminars,

training lawyers to do a better job in these cases.

This is a simple extension of that, and it was, as I say, admitted in the Sammarco case in which he is advising � it's not about counsel. It's not about work product.

It is about this witness and the degree to which his admitted extreme bias against tobacco companies has gone.  That's what it's about.

MR. PEDROSA:  And, Your Honor, we've heard on the plaintiff's side the following sentence uttered:  The lawyers remind us that we cannot defend these lawsuits on the basis of free choice if the plaintiff is addicted.

So to say that this is somehow a litigation reference when this is an outside retained, paid expert witness writing about what evidence he wants to see in the case and wants to talk about in the case clearly goes to the bias, as Mr. Davis has pointed out.

MR. GDANSKI:  Judge, this is entirely distinguishable from the Sammarco case.  This e-mail is written in the Sammarco case, not in

24 Mary Cooper's case.

That's a huge distinction.  The fact

that it was admitted in Sammarco and only Sammarco, notwithstanding the history and how long this has been around, proves that distinction.

This has nothing to do with Mary Cooper. It has nothing to do with Dr. Cummings' bias.  It is what Your Honor most respectfully holds very, very truly as a sensitive issue of litigation strategy from another case.

THE COURT:  Well, okay.

MR. GDANSKI:  This has nothing to do with Mary Cooper, and it doesn't go to his bias.

It's not � I'm sorry to keep going, but this has nothing to do with my firm.  It has nothing to do with Ms. Cooper's case, what

15 Ms. Cooper saw or didn't see.

You want to say that it's rare and random that she saw it, that's fine, but this is overly prejudicial.

Your Honor has kept out, over our request to put in, lawyer documents telling them how to defend the case, lawyer documents telling them how to defend the case.

And now they want to put in a document from another firm in a different case about how to prosecute the case.

That is exactly the same thing.  If they want the goose/gander rule, we will put in all of the documents telling them to play hardball with the victims of tobacco, telling them to do all sorts of things, keeping all eyes on the plaintiff in all litigation.

We'll put in all those documents, a treasure trove of them, all of them, and then we'll see which one, on balance, weighs which way.

But that is not something Your Honor is going to obviously entertain.  We'll put in the Patton memo saying:  Make the other son of a bitch spend all their money.  We'll put all of those documents in.

MR. BELASIC:  Those are lawyer memos though, Your Honor.  This is a witness �

MR. GDANSKI:  This is a lawyer memo,

18 Mr. Scarola articulating Judge Streitfeld's ruling

to his expert.  It's work product.  It's an inadvertent disclosure.  It has nothing to do with this case.  It's overly prejudicial.

down.

MR. GDANSKI:  There's no evidence in this case anywhere whatsoever at any point in time that anybody who was participating in the representation of Ms. Cooper at the time she gave her deposition had anything to do with this.  They can never make that link.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me ask you, I guess, just a hypothetical.  Specific to the issue that you've raised � they didn't raise it. You-all raised it on direct.  And that's the video of the CEO.  You-all played it in your case in chief.  Okay?

MR. GDANSKI:  Sure.

THE COURT:  And apparently he's relying to some degree on his opinions about addiction because of her statements in the record that she saw it, right?

So far, that's developed in your part of the case, right?

She saw it.  Her daughter saw it together.  He uses it as part of his basis to rely that she was misled by whatever, by looking at a Nightline video of a CEO who says there's nothing wrong with smoking and you can keep smoking,

something to that effect.

MR. GDANSKI:  That is exactly what happened to Mary Cooper, yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  All right.  So let's just take it in that framework.  Would an expert then be permitted to be asked:  Had you voluntarily suggested in these tobacco cases that this clip be played for whatever purpose?

MR. GDANSKI:  Would an expert �

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. GDANSKI:  I'm thinking through your question.

THE COURT:  Because he's admitted in the direct and the cross that he chose what videos to show and what slides to give the lawyers, for the

16 most part, as part of his presentation.

MR. GDANSKI:  They've asked Dr. Cummings that exact question all the time:  Why did you show this?  Why?

I think it's relevant to the history of this issue.

Do you think that you need to show this to explain the history?

Sure .

THE COURT:  Well, that's what I'm trying to �

MR. GDANSKI:  � because we're objecting to all of them, and here's why, here's why we're objecting to all of them:  We play that video in every case.

That video precedes the Engle litigation as an important part of this story.  That video will come after the Engle litigation and continues on in the absence of Engle progeny cases against the industry.

That's an important part of the video.

19 We played it in Banks.  So now that Ms. Cooper

actually saw it, that should be held against her?

THE COURT:  Well, no, it's not.  It's offered for a different purpose in this case than it is the others.

The others, as I remember, it was admissions by the tobacco company that misled the

public relating to the health effects of cigarettes.

In this case, you're using it as direct evidence to say:  I saw it, which is the first smoker I've seen say this.  I actually saw the video, and you're buttressing it with an expert who said:  Well, as a result of her seeing it, this continued her to perpetuate to smoke because the tobacco companies were misleading her that there really wasn't anything wrong with smoking. She was an addicted smoker, and you're using it for a different purpose in this trial.

MR. GDANSKI:  Yeah, but this is a memo in a different case.

THE COURT:  I'm not letting the memo in.

16 Why do you keep arguing about the memo?

MR. GDANSKI:  Okay.  So I'm putting the

18 memo down.

What question could they possibly ask about this that doesn't touch on the memo?

THE COURT:  Well, I think they can ask � I'm tending to agree that they can ask the question that's in the memo there.

MR. GDANSKI:  Which question is that?

Dr. Cummings injects himself to this degree by, one, bringing the slides in and saying:  This is what I'm going to show as part of my evidence, and, by the way, you should show this Nightline video, I mean, you know, there's a line here between an expert and an advocate.

And I'm wondering if he's crossing that line when he's telling lawyers what to do here.  I agree with your argument.

And that's why I say to my other side in this case is, you-all have asked me to, to some degree, sanitize a lot of this internal stuff and a lot of these documents relating to preparation of cases for trial, litigation strategy.

And is it worth it, because if you open the door on this, on this one collateral subtle issue, which you've already made your point on with him, then I don't know where else I'm going to let them go with this.

I mean you can't have it both ways, defendants.  You can't say:  Listen, I don't want everybody to know what we were doing, how much

23 money we were spending, how we were hiring expert

witnesses.

asked me to keep out where it said that you were coaching expert witnesses or telling them what to say.

I don't know what it was, but there's a lot of stuff on your side that you've asked me to keep out, and I've said:  We're trying this case based on the facts of Engle, not what the plaintiffs's lawyers are doing and what seminars they're going to, not what your experts are doing and what seminars you're going to.

The expert witnesses are a little bit different because I think both sides are entitled to bring out their biases.

law trial was created.

side conduct of a witness we bring in this trial �

THE COURT: Okay. Is it worth it? Do you want to go one question on one Nightline and open the door?  Is it worth it?

If it's worth it, fine.  If it's worth it, then I'm going to let them reopen the door on it and go back to those internal documents that I've excluded, let Mr. Bass on redirect go back through it again.

MR. BELASIC:  I can give you our position.  No, it's not worth it.  So I move that we should be allowed to use that, but I object. I'm not going � I'm going to preserve my objections here.

If you're going to let in � Your Honor, as I understand, if you're going to let in lawyer documents if we put in the fact that their witness is advising and running this case, then, no, of course not.

THE COURT: You've certainly made your point with the jury on that.

MR. BELASIC:  Okay.

THE COURT:  And I just would wonder whether we want to reopen these doors �

MR. BELASIC:  No.

THE COURT:  � and ask me to consider every one of these documents.

You've made your points on this, in all due respect, as to how it would be so incredible for her to just see this one program under this one isolated instance.

And now I think on just a subtle collateral issue where I'm not letting the memo in, I think you are taking a chance of opening doors that you may not be able to close.

MR. BELASIC:  Then let me make a brief proffer.  I would propose that I would be able to ask Dr. Cummings that not under only the extraordinary unusual circumstances of this case, that she supposedly left work and came home and with her young daughter watched at 11:30 at night the one show in 35 years that had my client's CEO on it, that under those circumstances, I would be entitled to point out and would ask him:  In fact, you advise lawyers:  Get some Nightline evidence. Play Nightline.  Talk to me about Nightline.

And, Your Honor, also in the last paragraph � and Mr. Gdanski was wrong.  This is Dr. Cummings writing to a lawyer.  It is not the

lawyer to Cummings.

Dr. Cummings, who signs his name Mike, says:  If you can ask me to assume why she might have switched from unfiltered to filtered to light or ask me to assume her reliance, then I can opine generally about evidence that supports this.

This is the witness directing the show, and, with all due respect, Your Honor, I think that's different from the advocates, the lawyers on both sides.

I'm not going to show Jonathan Gdanski's

THE COURT:  I certainly understand the distinction.  I certainly understand what you're trying to do, sir.  I'm fully aware based on looking at all this.

If you want and you want to take a chance that I may or may not rule differently later, just ask him in a generic way:  Have you been giving advice to lawyers in these cases about what to show during this, which you already brought out.

MR. GDANSKI:  That's been made already.

THE COURT:  I don't know why you want to

MR. HENK:  Judge, can I just add one thing?

Would you entertain a motion � because Your Honor mentioned having it fair on both sides, a rule across both sides.

Would you entertain a motion to exclude the document that Mr. Pedrosa mentioned?  I think it was PT2184, the lawyers remind us.  Would you entertain a motion to exclude that document?

THE COURT:  No.  I've let that in in every trial I've presided over.  That's a different situation.

And I've kept out a whole bunch of stuff on your side that they haven't even tried to bring in that they wanted to bring in in banks about discussions between the lawyers, discussions between the company, and how they were going to defend these cases.

I have done what I can to streamline in a fair way, in my judgment � that's my judgment. You guys have your own �

THE COURT:  The document is out.  The questions are overruled � sustained.  No further testimony on this.

MR. DAVIS:  And I think we know this, Your Honor, but this is not about our perception of your ability or willingness to divide the line here.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. DAVIS:  This was about � that's not what this was about.

THE COURT:  All right.  I'm fine, Stan. I've done what I can do here.  I'm not going to permit it.  I think it gets into collateral issues.

We're going to keep focused.  We're going to get through Dr. Cummings and keep moving.

We're going to stop at 12.  So let's go 20 more minutes.  Mark, do you think you'll finish in 20, or no?

MR. BELASIC:  Yes, I do.

THE COURT:  All right.  Good.

THE COURT:  Two hours more or less in direct � redirect, an hour, an hour and a half?

MR. BASS:  Judge, it's hard to say, and I appreciate the estimation.  It's hard to say because there might be issues that we have to make hard issues about timing for potential plane flights.  I'm not sure what that is.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Whatever it is, it looks to me like we're going to quit with him today.

So if you quit at 4:00 � I'd like the jury to go home a little early, let everybody else catch airplanes that need to get out of here.

the people who smoked roll-your-owns to the people who smoked factory-made cigarettes, you reported that the roll-your-own smokers appeared to be more addicted than the factory-made smokers, right?

A.  That's right.  They tended to smoke more per day, scored higher on other indicators of dependence.

Q.  And in your studies, you found that the people who smoked roll-your-owns as opposed to the factory-made cigarettes, the roll-your-own smokers seemed to inhale deeper, right?

A.  That's right.  They were more addicted.

Q.  And in the studies that you published, you said that roll-your-owns are not safer than factory-made and, if anything, they are more dangerous, right?

A.  Yeah.  It's the same tobacco.

Q.  And in the studies that you, yourself, have published, you found that there was evidence that the people that smoked roll-your-owns have higher rates, are more likely to get larynx cancer than the people who smoke factory-mades?

A.  I think they cited a study.  There's a study to that effect.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Now you explained who Dr. Koop was a while ago, and Dr. Koop was the Surgeon General in 1988 when the Surgeon General put out his report on addiction?

THE REPORTER:  I'm sorry, Your Honor, I
	

can't hear you.
	

THE COURT:  No, you don't need this.
	

I'm just talking to Mr. Bass.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Anyway, I got ahead of
	

myself.  So now you have it.  You've seen, Doctor,
	

this drkoop.com called Tackling Tobacco and
	

Breaking Up is Hard to Do?
	

A.  Right, written by Debora Orrick.
	

MR. BELASIC:  And, Your Honor, we would
	

move in ANS9023 into evidence.
	

THE COURT:  In evidence.
	

(Defendants' Exhibit ANS9023 was
	

received in evidence.)
	

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  And this was from
	

2002, correct?

A.  Sure.

MR. BELASIC:  Can we go to the highlighted sentence?

THE COURT:  Whatever else you-all want to read, you can read on direct or for completeness I'll read, but we'll read it.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  All right.  It says: 48 million of us have successfully quit.

So that was in 2002, and that was a number the Surgeon General would use?

A.  Yes.

Q.  All right.  And now it's 60 million.

A.  Right.

Q.  And it says on drkoop.com in 2002:  When you are engaged in internal warfare with yourself about whether or not to light up a cigarette, you can fortify yourself by remembering this important fact:  Ultimately you are the one that has control over your behavior.

The cigarette is not going to light itself and jump into your mouth, nor are you going to go into a brain-induced hypnotic trance and light the cigarette.

No matter how much you have smoked or how much you like to smoke, the choice to light up is always yours.

Fighting the temptation to smoke is not easy.  It is always a hard-won victory, but the rewards are freedom, health, and empowerment.

If you prepare well and arm yourself with a variety of strategies to combat the cravings, you can win.

Did I read that portion correctly? A.  Sure.

MR. BASS: Judge, for completeness, we'd ask that the first page of the document, the first paragraph be read as well for completeness.

THE COURT:  All right.  Would you do that, Mr. Belasic, please?

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  I have worked in the field of chemical dependency for 25 years, and I have often heard people who have quit using other drugs say that tobacco is the hardest drug to stop using.

This frequently catches people off guard because tobacco is a legal drug, and there are very few treatment centers for tobacco cessation in comparison with the many treatment programs for

MR. BASS:  And the second paragraph too, please, Your Honor.

Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  If you have felt that quitting your smoking habit is the hardest thing you have ever done, you are not alone, you are not crazy, nor are you exaggerating the truth. Tobacco is highly addictive with addictive behaviors that are very hard to change. There are very good reasons why this is true, and understanding them can help you to conquer your tobacco habit.

Now we talked about your smoking, stop smoking brochure yesterday in the '80s and the '90s, and obviously the United States Government and the experts at the U.S. Government have published similar brochures, right?

A.  Sure.

Q.  The National Cancer Institute had a famous one called Clearing the Air?

A.  That's right.

Q.  And the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is charged with providing information to the public about things like smoking, correct?

A.  Anybody can provide information on smoking, but, yes, the government does do that.

Q.  All right.  And they often publish consumer guides, whether it's a consumer guide to the Surgeon General's report or a consumer guide on smoking or other healthy � or risky behaviors, correct?

A.  Yes.

Q.  Do you see in front of you a document that's entitled You Can Quit Smoking?

A.  I do.

Q.  And do you see that it is a consumer guide, and it's published by the United States Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service, right?

A.  That's right.

Q.  That's one of the agencies that we've been talking about throughout this trial that disseminates information to the public?

A.  Yes, it is.

Q.  Correct?

A.  Uh-huh.

Q.  And if you look at the back, do you see this is the United States Department of Health and Human Services.  This government report or

MR. BELASIC:  And, Your Honor, this is
	

my final document.  I'd move PMU31765 into
	

evidence.

Consumer Guide, U.S. Department of Health and
	

Human Services.
	

That's the government, right?

A.  Out of the Surgeon General's office,
	

yes .

Control that we've been talking about, right, the
	

Public Health Service and the U.S. Department of

A.  Well, yes.  CDC is under the U.S.
	

Department of Health and Human Services.
	

Q.  And on Page 7 when they talk about
	

Special Situations or Conditions, the United
	

States Department of Health and Human Services
	

Public Health Service tells consumers that:
	

Studies suggest that everyone can quit smoking,
	

right?
	

I read that correctly?
	

A.  You read it correctly.
	

MR. BELASIC:  That's all the questions I
	

have.
	

MR. BASS:  Judge, I'm sorry, I wasn't

document, the very first entry be read.

THE COURT:  You can read it.  Go ahead and read it.

MR. BELASIC:  All right. Q.  (BY MR. BELASIC)  Nicotine:  A Powerful

know how hard it can be.  It is hard because nicotine is a very addictive drug.  For some people, it can be as addictive as heroin or cocaine.

I'll read the next sentence.

Quitting is hard.  Usually people make two or three tries or more before finally being able to quit.

All right.  And after they tell smokers that smoking is addictive and it can be hard to quit, they also tell smokers that the studies on this suggest that everyone can quit smoking. That's what they tell them.

MR. BELASIC:  All right.  I have no more questions then, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  All right.  Very good. Thank you, Mr. Belasic.

Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, here's what we're going to do.  We're going to break for

lunch.

Let me give you an update on the schedule so you know where we're going.  I hate you keep you-all in the dark.

But then sometimes I hate to give you the schedule because I'm always held to that, and it sometimes varies depending on how we get through things.

We still have three defendants to ask questions to this witness.  They're going to be relatively short compared to what we've been going through.

And they're not going to repeat what

14 Mr. Belasic did, so a lot of the things that they

would have asked would have come out through

16 Mr. Belasic's cross-examination

And then we have some redirect from the plaintiffs.  They'll be asking the doctor some

19 more questions about some of the things he's

already testified to.

So what I've done is give the lawyers a heads-up that I think because it's been a long week that we'll finish with Dr. Cummings today some time hopefully mid to later afternoon.

And then when we conclude with him, I'll

let you go home early.  So that's my goal for today, rather than call another witness down and not know how long that witness might be on the witness stand, is what we might do.

So if everything goes well, we'll break a little early this evening. I'm sure that won't be disappointing to all of you-all.

But from now until then, we've still got a lot of work to do, a lot more focus that we need you for.

So we're going to be in recess then until 1:20.  Don't discuss the case during the recess at all.  Don't access the Internet.  See you back at 1:20.  Have a good one.

2275 CROSS EXAMINATION

BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    I wanted to start with you � and if you have your notes you may know this.  I just wanted to review and be clear about the material that you reviewed in connection with providing your testimony. In general I understand it was deposition transcripts that were available, medical records, the defense CME, other documents, videos, phone interview.  Those were the � in general were the bases of your opinion and testimony that you've given over the last few days.

A.    Sure.

Q.    Okay.  And specifically regarding the depositions, you reviewed the deposition, of course, of

15 Ms. Cooper, the plaintiff.

A.    Correct.

Q.    And also the deposition of Jacqueline Blackwood, also Mechelle Blackwood, her daughter.

A.    Yes.

Q. And she lives here in Broward County with her mother. You understand that. Did you get that from the deposition?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And then also Ms. Dahary, Concetta Dahary, who is Ms. Cooper's granddaughter.

Q.    Do you know where she lives?

A.    No.

Q.    Did you see that from the deposition?

A.    It may have been in there �

Q.    Over in the Fort Myers area ring a bell?

A.    No.

Q.    And then Mary Bray, who is also a granddaughter, Ms. Bray lives with her grandmother and her mother here in Broward County.

A.    Correct.

You reviewed that deposition.

I did.

And then also Mr. Aaron, Robert Aaron, her

fiance, longtime significant other, you reviewed that.

A.    I did.

Q.    And he lives here in Broward County as well.

A.    Yes.

Q.    All right, sir.

And then there were a number of people who were not in the state, Mr. Hollingsworth, her former husband; Mr. Bray, her former husband.  He's up in North Carolina, also Mr. Hollingsworth.  And then Sherry Cooper Ariola, her stepsister; Gary Cooper, her stepbrother; those are folks that are all up in North

A.    Correct.

Q.    Okay.  And, again, all of those and all the other stuff you read provided the substance and underlying basis for some of the work that you � some of the testimony that you've given.

A.    True.  And five of her treating doctors.

Q.    Of course, yeah.  And I wasn't excluding them.  You reviewed those.

A.    Yep.

Q.    Now, some of those depositions of the family

A.    I don't know whether they videoed.

Q.    It doesn't matter to you, I guess is my point.  You don't need to review video to get the information that you need.  You can get it from the transcripts.

A.    Well, I was sent the transcripts.  That's what I reviewed.

Q.    And it was sufficient for your purposes.

A.    I reviewed those, yes.

Q.    Do you ever ask for videos as opposed to transcripts?

A.    I never do ask for videos because I've always done � sometimes I'm videoed and sometimes I'm

Q.    I understand.  I understand.  But my point is that you can get what you need to testify from the transcripts and not the videos.

A.    That's right.

Q.    Okay.

A.    I always ask at deposition if there's anything that I'm missing to share it with me at the time that I'm questioned.  So if I � you know, if it's something I'm missing that would change my opinion to show it to me.  Nothing was shared with me that would have changed my opinion.

Q.    Okay.  I want to go now just build a very quick little chart of the Philip Morris products that were used by Ms. Cooper.  And I want to make sure that I've got it right.

A.    Sure.

Q.    If you'd find your place in your notes.

A.    That's okay.  I know it.

Q.    Okay.  I'm correct that in 1990 she switched to Marlboro menthol; is that right?

A.    Correct.  100s.

Q.    The Marlboro menthol 100s.

A.    Right.

Q.    And then in 1995 she switched to the

1 |Marlboro menthol light 100s.

2     A.    Correct

3     Q.    Correct?

4           So I'll just put the lights, but we

5 understand that's the Marlboro menthol lights 100s.

6     A.    Correct

7     Q.    And then we have this date that I think you � I think Mr. Belasic asked you about, which is

9 November 21, 1996.  And you recall the testimony about

10 the significance of that date, your testimony or the

11 questions about it.

12     A.    I don't recall the significance of that.

13     Q.    Do you understand that to be a member of the

14 Engle class she has to show that her laryngeal cancer

15 manifested on or before November 21, 1996?

A.    Sure.

Q.    Do you know when or did your review show when in point of time in 1995 she shifted and switched to the lights?

A.    What exact day, no.

Q.    Any aspect of the year, when in 1995 at all?

A.    No.

Q.    Well, let's do it this way then.  The earliest she could have switched would have been January 1 of 1995, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And the latest she could have switched would have been December 31 of 1995.

A.    Correct.

Q.    Okay.  If she switched in � on January 1 of 1995 she would have had less than two years of lights use by 1996, by November 21, 1996, correct?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And if she switched at the end of the year, December 31, she would have had less than one year.

A.    Okay.

Q.    So we can be confident, I hope, that her usage of light cigarettes before November 21, 1996 was somewhere between less than one and less than two years.

A.    Okay.

Q.    Now, these lights, these Marlboro menthol 100 lights that she switched to in 1995 are the only light cigarettes that she ever smoked.

A.    That's my understanding.

Q.    No lights manufactured by RJ Reynolds or Lorillard or Liggett or any other cigarette

23 manufacturer, based on your review of the record.

A.    Correct.

Q.    Okay, sir.  Now, did you ask her why in 1990

2281 she switched from the � or do you know why she switched from the brand she was smoking before 1990 to the Marlboro, the PM product in 1990?

A.    No.

Q.    Did you ask her?

A.    No, I did not.

Q.    Was it � why not?

A.    Wasn't relevant to my review of whether she was addicted or not.  Both are � contain nicotine. The only relevance was that the amount that she was smoking went up when she went to the lights.

Q.    And I'm really focusing now � we'll get to that, but I want to go � I'm staying here.

So the reason she switched from one brand to another was not relevant to your opinion.

A.    Wasn't � it wasn't something I asked her about I think is what you said.

Q.    No, I asked you why, and I thought what you said was it wasn't relevant to my opinion.  Is that fair?

A.    No, I don't think that's fair.  I basically didn't ask her about why she switched.  I was asking her about the amount of cigarettes she was smoking, and her smoking went up.  And that was relevant information knowing and understanding the effect of switching down

Q.          � in 1995.  Focus on that.

A.          Sure.

Q.          Now, there was a statement made by

because she saw an ad that made her think that the lights were safer.  And I know you weren't here � MR. BASS:  Object to the reference to opening statement.

THE COURT:  Rephrase that, Mr. Davis. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    Assume hypothetically that during opening statement one of the lawyers for Ms. Cooper said, so we stopped with Mary switching to lights because she had seen the ad and she thought they would be safer.  All right, sir?

A.    Right.

Q.    Is that your understanding that she switched to lights because she had seen a specific ad and had thought from that ad or � that the cigarettes were

Q.    I'm sorry, sir.  I misunderstood.  I must have asked a bad question because I wasn't asking you about the word "lights." A.    Uh-huh.

Q.    What I was asking you was whether or not it was your understanding that she switched to lights because she saw a specific advertisement that led her to believe they were safer.

A.    That I don't know.  I mean, she talked about seeing advertise �

THE COURT:  If your answer is responsive to this question, Doctor, if you don't know, then I'm not sure you need to explain.  But if you do need to explain, you can, but only if it's responsive to this question.  Okay? THE WITNESS:  Sure.

Q.    How does that explain your answer that you don't know whether she saw a specific ad?

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative. THE COURT:  I'm let him answer the question. Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Well, I know she saw a specific ad because the package is part of the ad.  That's why I mentioned the word "light." It's on the package. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    Leaving aside the packaging itself, can you identify a specific advertisement that you believe

19 Ms. Cooper saw that caused her to switch to lights?

A.    No, of course not.  I don't think she was shown ads, so I can't respond to that based on what I read in the materials.

Q.    You can't respond to it?

A.    I can't � she was not shown any specific ads and therefore I can't comment on whether she said,

2287 for this case, which is to assess her addiction.

Q.    Now, she did testify, did she not, and did you see in the record that she explained what happened the first time she got a pack of lights, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And that was when she was out of her regular brand and her daughter Mechelle, who occasionally bought cigarettes for her, went to the store.  They were out of the menthol 100s and she picked up the lights and she took them home.

A.    That's correct.

Q.    Now, Ms. Cooper in her deposition testified that she didn't remember switching to any brand because of advertising, or anything like that, right?

A.    Yeah, I think Mr. Belasic had asked that yesterday, yes.

Q.    If he did, I didn't hear it.  And I usually try to pay attention to him.  But let me just make sure it's clear.

Her testimony, her unequivocal testimony was that from the time she started smoking Belair, which was her first brand, until all the way through to

23 Marlboro menthol light 100s she did not remember any

advertisement playing a role in her decision about which brands to smoke, correct?

A.
	I don't think she switched because
		of the

specific
	ad when she was aske
	d the question.
	I think

the transcript is � we were

	and she

had answered no to that.
		
	

Q.

	did continue a
	fter her

daughter
	Mechelle brought home the lights, s

continued
	smoking them, correct?
		

A.
	Yes.  Adopted that

	brand.

Q.

A.
	Adopted that as her

	until 2001

when she

Q.
	When she quit, yes,

	She

smoked th
	e lights all the way

after her

A.
	Correct.

Q.
	Well, when she was asked about why she

thought
	they were safer, first of all, she couldn't

really r
	emember who she heard that from, right?

A.
	That's right.

had read

A.

Q.

Q.    You have never seen in all your work a statement where Philip Morris said that, or used the word "safer" in describing light cigarettes as opposed to full-flavor cigarettes.

A.    Not using the word "safer."  I've seen � Q.    That's my question is whether you've seen Philip Morris use the word "safer."

MR. BASS:  Objection.  I think Dr. Cummings is going to explain his answer.

THE COURT:  It's a straightforward question, yes or no.  You can ask him to amplify on redirect if necessary. THE WITNESS:  No. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    Thank you, sir.

Let me ask you something.  As you have gotten to know Ms. Cooper through your interview and reading the material, if she was interested in a cigarette that she thought was safer, why did she switch in the '70s?

A.    She said she was smoking a filtered cigarette and those were advertised as safer.

Q.    And you've got a page, I think it's page 2 of your notes where you've listed all the medical records you reviewed, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And some of those talk about how much she's smoking.

A.    That's right.

Q.    Okay.  Let's just go through the ones that you saw and see what we've got here.  Okay?

A.    Okay.

Q.    And these are, again, records you've identified.  I'm just putting down your words, and you tell me if I get it wrong.

A.    Sure.

Q.    So you've got a record from January 11 of '96.  Do you see that one?

A.    I do.

Q.    And it says "1 PPD X 30 years," right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And what that means is that that record, that medical record of January 11, 1996 shows that she was smoking 1 pack per day and had been for 30 years.

January 16, '96 that shows 1 pack per day for 30 years,
	
right?
	

A.
	Correct.

Q.
	And then we have a record from � another

one from 1-16-96 that says she smoked approximately
	
1 pack
	per day, correct?

A.
	True.

Q.
	And then on February 19 � oh I'm sorry.  I

missed

A.

A.    6 �

Q.    6-21-04 1 pack per day for 30 years.

A.    Right.  Quit three years.

Q.    Yeah, it says "quit."  I mean, I know you've got the quits there, and we can do that.  I'm really focusing on the amount that it shows.

August 18 of '04 1 to 2 packs per day for 25 to 30 years, right?

A.    That's right.

Q. Then in January 28 of '05 she used to smoke 1.5 packs per day for 33 years. That's what that one shows, right?

A.    Correct.

Q. And then on February 17 of '05 we've got same thing, right, 1.5 packs per day for 33 years, right?

A.    We do.

Q.    And then I'm going to do one more and I'm going to have to get on a new sheet I think.  And then we get down to April 27 of '05, 1.5 packs per day, right?

Q.
	Now, just so we've got this in time frame,

every one of these records postdates, is after she
	
switched
	to lights, right?

A.
	True.

Q.
	Because we know she switched sometime in

'95.
	

A.
	That's right.

Q.
	And our medical records that we have in our

case start in '96.
	
A.
	Yep.

Q.
	So every one of these records is after she

switched
	to lights.

A.
	True.

Q.

in '01.

A.    No, I don't think so.

Q.    Then January 8 of '08, we're now in '08, it says 1 pack per day for 25 years.  Right?

A.    Yep.

Q.    And then 6-11-08, 30 pack year, 30-pack-year history, and it says quit in '9 � so that would have

a day that would start in '78, correct?

A.    Yeah.

Q.    Because a pack year is 1 pack per day for a year.  So this would be the equivalent of saying she smoked 1 pack a day, if you go back to '78.

A.    Right.  Clearly inaccurate.

Q.    Right.  That's why we're looking at a lot of them, because you get variation.  And you expect to see variation.

A.    Sure.  And I actually asked her in the interview about it.

Q.    I'm sorry?

A.    Right.  She smoked for about 20 to 25 years 1 PPD.

Q.    Okay.  So I missed that one.  February 11, '09, 20 to 25 years, 1 pack per day.

A.    Yeah.  You've got a 2-24-1997, smoker of 35 years.  Doesn't give the amount.

Q.    Doesn't give the amount.

A.    No.

Q.    2-24 � what is it, what year?

A.    2-24-1997.

Q.    So it would be 2-24-97, and that would be here.  And what does it say?

A.    Smoked for 35 years.

Q.    35 years but no amount.

A.    Correct.

Q.    So do we now have on the chart all of the records that you found in the medical records that talk about how much she smoked?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And would you agree with me that the only record, the only one of all these that � I guess there are two; there's this one that has up to two packs a day, is this one in '04 that says 1 to 2 packs a day, and then we have this record in September of '09 that says 2 packs per day.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And other than those two, every other record indicates that she smoked less than two packs a day after she switched to lights.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And that, at least the records are consistent with her smoking, her report of how much she was smoking before she switched to lights, correct?

A.    Yeah, I don't think the records, none of the records I reviewed asked her about what she was smoking when she was only smoking light cigarettes.  It was over her entire smoking career.  That's why usually it was amount and years, because that's what the doctors are interested in, pack years.

Q.    You don't think she testified that she worked up to a pack and a half a day before she switched to lights.

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative.  Judge, and we're happy to put the chart into evidence. THE COURT:  Rephrase the question. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    Would you agree that the records that you found after '96 with the exception of two do not show 2 packs per day?

A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  Objection, asked and answered. THE WITNESS:  She was asked in her deposition about it.

THE COURT:  Overruled. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    And what did she say?

A.    She said after she switched to lights she had increased to 2 packs per day.

Q.    All right, sir.  Do you have her deposition, page 28 of Ms. Cooper's deposition? A.    No.

Q.    Let me ask you this.  Do you recall in her deposition her being asked this question?  It's page 28 of her deposition.

"Okay.  And then as you � as you switched to the Marlboro menthol lights 100s, did the amount you � of cigarettes per day that you smoked change at all?

"Answer:  I've always smoked anywhere from a pack and a half to 2 packs daily.

"Question: So then is it fair to say that your smoking didn't increase when you switched to Marlboro menthol lights 100s?

Now that's what she testified to at her deposition, correct?

A.    And much more.  I mean, she talked about � Q.    Now, I'm focusing specifically �

MR. BASS:  If he can put it in context.  And I didn't catch the page that we were on, I'm sorry.

MR. DAVIS:  It was 28, Hardee.  I'm sorry, it's page 227, line 6.  I apologize. BY MR. DAVIS:

MR. DAVIS:  And I misspoke.  It's 227, 6. THE COURT:  You can look at the page. MR. BASS:  Okay.  Thank you. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    And can you then go to your notes, and do they reflect another place in her deposition where she

did testify she went to two packs after she switched to lights?

A.    When she said � she's talking about one and a half to 2 packs.  "When I started smoking Marlboro

a day."  That's page 226, 227.  And on page 228 she says, "I sucked a little harder when I switched to lights."

Q.    I don't want to talk about sucking a little harder.  She did say she sucked a little harder on the lights, but she did clearly testify, did she not, in her deposition that it did not increase or decrease after she switched to lights?  That's my only question. MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative, repetitive.

	Now, she did tell
	you that her smoking did

increase, correct?  In your
		interview with her she said

that,
	right?
	

A
	Actually, I think
	she said it to the expert

from the defense �
		

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

2306

1     Q.    Okay.

2     A.    � as well as she told me that.  And there's

3 other testimony talking about her increasing her

4 smoking when she went to light.

5     Q.    If she did increase her smoking, if she did

6 increase her smoking she was aware that she was smoking

7 more, right, because she said it?

8     A.    She said she was sucking harder.

9     Q.    No, I'm going to do sucking harder secondly,

10 okay.  Can I do this first?

11     A.    Do whatever you want.

12     Q.    Appreciate that.

13           So if she did increase her smoking, and I

14 understand the testimony, but if she did that means she

15 was clearly aware of it, correct?

16     A.    Yes.

17     Q.    And if she did suck harder on the lights,

18 that would mean that she was aware that light

19 cigarettes do not smoke like regular cigarettes,

20 correct?

21           MR. BASS:  Objection, speculation.

22           THE COURT:  Overruled.

23           You can answer, if you know.

24           THE WITNESS:  I don't.  I don't know what

25       she was aware of in regards to that.

2307 BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    And you didn't ask her about that.

A.    No.

Q.    It was not relevant to your opinion whether she puffed harder after she switched to lights.

A.    That was relevant in terms of it's consistent with my knowledge and experience and training of what happens to smokers through compensation when they switch down, and addicted smokers tend to suck harder, take bigger, deeper puffs on the cigarettes.

Q.    But not knowing what that meant to her and based on what you've just said is all your experience in all of this, why didn't you ask her what she meant? MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative. THE COURT:  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  It wasn't relevant. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    It wasn't relevant.

A.    It was not relevant to my assessment of her being addicted to cigarettes.

Q.    All right.  Wasn't relevant.  Okay.  Okay. Okay.  Let me move on to something else.

A.    Sure.

you reca

A.
	Yes, Richard Heimann.

Q.
	Right.  And that was a deposition from 1986.

A.
	Correct.

Q.
	And after those clips were played I think

Mr. Bass
	asked you if that was after 1982.  Do you

remember
	that question and answer?

A.
	Not really.

Q.
	Okay.  But that was at a deposition, right,

I mean,
	a formal court � not a court, but in an

office,
	testimony before trial.

A.
	Sworn testimony.

Q.
	Right.  And that was almost 30 years ago, 28

years ag
	o.

A.
	Long time ago.

Q.
	And Ms. Cooper, you are not suggesting �

let me j

the jury
	that Ms. Cooper saw or heard that testimony,

correct?
	

A.
	No.

Q.
	And you are not intending to convey to the

jury tha
	t Ms. Cooper relied on the testimony that

Mr. Heimann gave in 1986, right?
	
A.
	Relied on that specific testimony?  No.

A.    Geoffrey Bible.

Q.    Geoffrey Bible.

� and a statement that he made in 1997, right?

A.    That's right.

A.    It was in a deposition, also picked up publicly and covered in the press.

Q.    All right, sir.  And I don't know that you said that, but you didn't tell them it was in a deposition, right?

A.    I'm not sure if I did or not.

Q.    Well, you aren't suggesting that Ms. Cooper heard or saw the testimony that Mr. Bible gave in '97, are you?

A.    I don't know whether she heard or saw any of that coverage for that testimony.

Q.    You don't know.

A.    I don't know.

Q.    And therefore you cannot say that she relied

	DAVIS:
	

Q.
	You've never designee
	a cigarette with or

without
	ammonia for commercial
	purposes, right?

A.
	That's correct.
	

Q.
	You've never designee
	a cigarette for any

company
	because you just don't
	design cigarettes.

A.
	True.
	

Q.
	And you've never had
	any patents for any

aspect
	of cigarette design.
	

A.
	That is true.
	

Q.
	Never testified in th
	Le past that you're --

and you
	've testified in the pas
	t under oath that you're

not an
	expert in cigarette desi
	gn.

A.
	True, for commercial
	applications.

Q.
	Okay.  Let's turn �
	I'm trying to move

through
	here and get us out.
	


	Now, I want to turn t
	o the subject of

cigarettes without nicotine.
		

A.
	Okay.

Q.    There's been some testimony about that.

A.    All right.

Q.    It's your belief that tobacco companies should not market cigarettes with nicotine in them; is that right?

A.    Very low.  I mean, not addictive levels.  So if you go below a threshold level that does not maintain addiction in a smoker so they can freely choose, that's my opinion, is that companies ought to do that if they're going to sell cigarettes at all.

Q.    Okay.  And you also believe that very few people would become smokers if cigarettes don't have nicotine in them, correct?

A.    That's true.  They might try it but they would not become persistent daily users, yes.

Q.    And people who were regular smokers would not smoke cigarettes that have no nicotine in them.

A.    Most smokers would quit if they could.

Q.    They would reject the low- or no-nicotine cigarette.

A.    They would stop smoking if they could do so easily.  That's what the internal records of the company show.

Q.    Well, the external public records of the company show that the tobacco companies have tried to

2314 develop very low or non-nicotine cigarettes, correct?

A.    At certain times that's true.

Q.    And over the years cigarettes without � very-low-nicotine cigarettes have been on the market, right?

A.    Not widely.  In test markets in three cities, I believe.

Q.    Well, over the years there have been low-nicotine cigarettes on the market, correct?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And for instance, in the 1950s there was a product that was available that had lower nicotine called King Sano, right?

A.    I would not classify that as a very-low-nicotine cigarette.  It was low relative to other products available at the time, but it was not in the category of being a nonaddictive product.

Q.    But it was certainly not very popular, right?

A.    They could not get shelf space to market it, that was the problem.

Q.    Now, in the late 1980s Philip Morris developed and marketed several brands of denicotized cigarettes, right?

A.    Yes, they did.

3     Q.    If I misspoke, it's late 1980s.

4     A.    Yes.

5     Q.    Now, they built an entire plant, entire

6 plant from the ground up dedicated to trying � to

7 making denicotized cigarettes, correct?

8     A.    They were already denicotinizing cigarettes,

9 but they did build a plant for this particular product.

10     Q.    They built a plant specifically to make

11 denicotized cigarettes, correct?

12     A.    Yes, sir.

13     Q.    And they actually went out and bought a

14 company called General Foods that was the maker of

15 Sanka Decaf Coffee, correct?

16     A.    Yes.

17     Q.    And that way they could get the same process

18 that General Foods had to take caffeine out of coffee

19 and use that same technical process to pull the

20 nicotine out of tobacco.

21     A.    Yes.

22     Q.    And they spent hundreds of millions of

23 dollars on that, correct? 2 4     A.    Ah, yeah.

25     Q.    And they took that � they then created

2316 cigarettes, brands of cigarettes that had very low nicotine, correct?

A.    Actually, it was just one product; they put it in different packaging.  So they had a package that was a unique name called Next.  Then they put the same cigarettes in a different box called Benson & Hedges De-Nic and Merit De-Nic and they sold those in three test markets in the United States for a brief period after 1988.

Q.    Well, you're not being derisive of that, are you?

A.    No.  It was a good idea.

Q.    You thought that was a good thing to do.

A.    Sure.  It's called Project ART, alkaloid reduced tobacco.

Q.    And they put those brands into test markets, right?

A.    Three test markets.

Q.    And that's the way new brands are introduced in the industry, correct, test markets?

A.    Well, that's the way they do their market research.

Q.    Well, that's the way new brands are introduced, correct?

A.    No.  Some brands are introduced nationally

when they know.  Marlboro when it was introduced was a national launch.  It wasn't just a test market.

Q.    Would you be willing to concede that using test markets is an accepted, recognized way of figuring out whether a new product is going to succeed?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And that's what they did?

A.    They put it in three test markets.

Q.    And it didn't succeed.

A.    Well, actually, no, I would disagree.  It did quite well.  There was huge consumer interest in a very-low-nicotine cigarette, that's what their market research showed.  They got a lot of trial, people trying the product.  And then when they withdrew the price supports for the product, sales went down, but actually not to extraordinarily low levels.  It still would have been a better-selling cigarette than some other brands on the market at the time.

Q.    Well, let's just unpack that.  When they put it in the test markets, they offered a lot of price promotions, correct?

A.    They do that as part of all new product launches.

Q.    Right.  And then they withdrew the price promotions and the sales went down.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And ultimately the products were removed.

A.    They were removed very quickly.  They were out for less than a year.

Q.    But you do agree that a cigarette without nicotine is still not safe to smoke, right?

A.    Depends on how much of it you smoke.  The studies that I've done with very-low-nicotine cigarettes show that people can use them to wean themselves from their addiction to regular cigarettes. So I would think it's a great idea, and a lot of people want to quit.

Q.    Let me try it the other way and see if it's a shorter answer.  Are you telling �

Q.    � this jury that a cigarette without nicotine is safe?

THE COURT:  Just answer the question. THE WITNESS:  Depends on how much you smoke. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    And the smoke from a denicotized cigarette still has thousands of chemicals and dozens of carcinogens, correct?

A.    Sure.

Q.    Denicotized cigarettes can cause cancer if you smoke enough of them.

A.    Only if you smoke enough of them.

Q.    That's true of any cigarette, correct?

A.    That's true.

Q.    You agree that denicotized cigarettes like Next and Benson & Hedges De-Nic, Merit, the Merit De-Nic can cause cancer if you smoke enough of them.

A.    Yes.

Q.    Because they still deliver tar.

A.    True.

Q.    And if you burn the tobacco in a cigarette that does not have any nicotine, it has polycyclic hydrocarbons that are carcinogenic, correct?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And, in fact, puff by puff you agree that a denicotized cigarette is just as carcinogenic as a conventional cigarette.

A.    Yeah.

Q.    And the only way it would be safer is if people just stopped smoking.

A.    If people didn't smoke as many of them, which is the point.

Q.    Now, do you remember the video, and I think it was yesterday, of the inside the Philip Morris lab

A.    Sure.

Q.    And I think it was a video that showed inside the lab and there were microscopes and people doing research, looked like a scientific laboratory.

A.    It was a scientific laboratory.

Q.    That's why it looked that way.  Fair point. Now, you said there are two ways to grow tobacco with no nicotine, if I understand it.  One is crossbreeding and one is genetic engineering.

A.    That's right.

Q.    That's basically it.

A.    That's what they said in the film.

Q.    They said that in the film.

But you're not a molecular biologist. You're not a biologist or plant geneticist in any way. You were just going with what was in the film.

A.    Sure, and what are in the internal business records of the company.

Q.    And you testified, I believe, when you showed that video that the objective of Philip Morris' genetic engineering of tobacco plants was to try to develop plants that were free of nicotine by blocking the formation of something called NPO, a chemical deal?

Q.    Now, I want to turn to another subject here. On, I think it was Tuesday morning you were asked if you took the nicotine out of cigarettes what would happen.  Do you recall that?  And I think you said a lot of good things would happen.  That was your testimony, right?

Q.    I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to cut you off. A.    Sure.

Q.    I'd like to focus about what your opinion on this subject was in the year 2000, which was one year before Ms. Cooper stopped smoking. A.    Sure.

Q.    And in the year 2000 you testified that it was not feasible to eliminate nicotine from cigarettes, correct?

A.    That's right, to zero.

Q.    Well, the testimony that you gave in a trial in '14 � we can get it if you want to look at it.  "As of the year 2000 you did not think it feasible to eliminate nicotine from cigarettes."  And you answered, "True."

2327 MR. BASS:  Objection, improper impeachment. THE COURT:  Overruled.  It's a general question.

You can answer the question. THE WITNESS:  I did state that, and the context, I've already indicated, was regarding the light cigarettes. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    And was it not the case that in 2000 you said that one could even argue that you should increase the nicotine in cigarettes? A.    Yes.

Q.    You had testified at some point in the last couple of days about the cigarette � what do you call it?  The Ogg machine, the FTC method of measuring cigarette smoke.  Do you recall that?  The FTC method. Didn't you talk about the � something about we fooled the machine or the companies fooled the machine? A.    No, sir.

Q.    You didn't talk about that. A.    No.

Q.    All right.  Do you contend that the cigarette companies did anything wrong with respect to the FTC method of measuring tar and nicotine that was in place from about '97 to '08?

A.    Yes.

Q.    All right.  Well, let's go back then and talk about that.

The FTC is the Federal Trade Commission, correct?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And they were considering whether or not to adopt a method called the Ogg method for measuring tar and nicotine, correct?

A.    True.

Q.    It was a machine that would measure � the

A.    In a standardized way, yes.

Q.    In a standardized way and come out with specific tar and nicotine measurements, correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And before they adopted that technique for doing it, the tobacco manufacturers made a submission to the FTC, correct?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And the FTC is one of the federal agencies that regulates cigarettes, correct?

A.    It is.

Q.    So let's look at PMU 0040.

Nicotine Content, November � a hearing November 1966, correct?

A.    True.

Q.    In this submission, this is what the, among other things, what the tobacco companies said, correct?

A.    Yeah, all but Lorillard.

Q.    I'm sorry?

A.    Lorillard did not sign this.

Q.    "The Ogg method, in fact, does not and cannot measure either all of the particulate matter or the total nicotine from any cigarette.  It measures only the PM" �

Which is?

A.    Particulate matter.

Q.    � "and nicotine in the volume of smoke puffed through a machine on a standardized method.  It does not measure the PM or nicotine in all of the smoke that any cigarette might produce when totally smoked under any and all condition.  It does not measure the volume of smoke or the PM or nicotine in the volume of smoke that any human being," and that's underlined, right, "any human being will draw from smoking any particular cigarette.

2331 levelled or averaged out by the standard method.  No two human smokers smoke in the same way.  No individual smoker always smokes in the same fashion.  The speed at which one smokes varies both among smokers and usually also varies with the same individual under different circumstances, even within the same day.  Some take long puffs or draws.  Some takes short puffs.  That variation affects the PM," particulate matter, "quantity of the smoke generated."

Now, that was what the company said to the FTC.

A.    Yes.

Q.    Let's go to the next page.

"The Ogg method does not and cannot measure these many variations in human smoking habits.  It does not measure PM or nicotine in the smoke generated while the cigarette is not being puffed.  It does not measure all of the PM or nicotine in any cigarette, but only that in the smoke drawn in the standardized machine smoking, according to the prescribed method."  Correct?

A.    What page was that?

Q.    Sorry.  That was page 3.

A.    Right.  Okay.

Q.    You see it?

A.    I didn't, but that's fine.  I'm familiar

2332 with it.

Q.    Okay.  So what the industry was saying to the government agency that regulates it is that the Ogg

particulate matter. The standardized machine is not going to tell you what human beings are going to do, right?

A.    True.

Q.    And then the FTC then adopted this machine as the standardized measure, correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And that was the machine that would smoke cigarettes, the machine would, and then that would lead to the tar and nicotine figures that were on packs, I think until '08; is that it?

A.    That's right.

Q.    So for many years that machine was used as the reference point, correct?

A.    Right.

Q.    And after the FTC adopted it they issued a press release saying, we've now got this system that we're going to use, this machine that's going to smoke, it's going to tell us what tar is, tell us what the nicotine is, going to put it on the packs, put it out in the market.

A.    Right.  And also warn people these are averages, they don't tell you what you're necessarily going to get.

Q.    It's kind of like the EPA mileage in a car, right?

A.    Kind of like that.

Q.    Okay.  Then the FTC issued a press release, and that would be PMU 0042.

This is the press release that the FTC issued after adopting this machine method, this Ogg

A.    It is.

MR. DAVIS:  And I offer PMU 0 0 42. THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Defendants' Exhibit PMU 0042 was received in evidence.) BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    So here it is, it's about a half a year, year later, August 1, '67, it's now official, this is what we're going to do.

Down at the bottom of the first page, I'm pulling up this, "No test can precisely duplicate conditions of the actual human smoking," correct? A.    That's what it says. Q.    That's what the FTC said, correct?

BY
	MR. DAVIS:
	

	Q.
	And then on the next page it says, "No �

I 'm
	sorry
	, let me get it up. "No two human smokers smoke in the same way.

No
	indivi

fas
	hion."
	Very similar to what the tobacco companies

had

1 behavior."

2           Again the FTC is saying something very

3 similar, if not identical, to what the tobacco

5     A.    True.

A.    Right.  And I explained the plus signs, which are in another slide in the presentation.

Q.    And can we just simply agree that in connection with the Surgeon General formulating what became the 1964 report, this list of � the same chemicals that were in this presentation were given to the FTC by Philip Morris?

A.    Not this document, but the list.  There was a list of chemicals that was supplied to the Surgeon General, but not the conclusions of Dr. Wakeham's report at all.

Q.    Well, the list of � you weren't implying then when you put this up for the jury on Wednesday

Oh, sorry.  I've got one more.  My apologies. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    You have � you've used the term "threshold for addiction" and "threshold of nicotine," correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And, again, that's been in the context of your testimony about maintaining a specific threshold of nicotine that maintains addiction and that's what hurts these people, and you've used some pretty big numbers, right?

A.    It was based on the research that the companies were doing on how low do you go, and they were talking about a threshold level of nicotine that would keep people smoking.

Q.    Yeah.  Now, the fact of the matter is that as of 1994 no nicotine level had been established as a threshold for creating or maintaining addiction, true?

A.    True.

Q.    Since 19 � sorry?

A.    Publicly I would say that's true.  Certainly not true internal to the business records of the companies that I've reviewed, because they were testing cigarettes and commenting on very low nicotine cigarettes.

Q.    Well, I'm going to take you up now past the time that all these documents you've been talking about were in your hands and you've studied them and all these �

A.    Sure.

Q.    I'll move you along there.  You want to say secret documents one more time?

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative. THE COURT:  Just questions, Mr. Davis. MR. DAVIS:  I apologize. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    And since 1994 the Surgeon General has not established as of today a specific threshold for creating or maintaining addiction.

A.    True.

Q.    And, in fact, the Food and Drug

23 Administration of the United States is currently right

now having research done that is looking to the very question of whether or not there is a threshold level

2339 of nicotine that they think may create or sustain addiction.  That research is going on right now?

A.    It is.  I'm involved with it.

Q.    So there is no scientific accepted threshold of nicotine at all, correct?

A.    Well, I would say that it's still a subject of research; although we have certainly a lot of knowledge as to what that level would be.

Q.    But millions of dollars are being spent in laboratories all around the country right now trying to figure out is there a threshold and, in fact, what is it.  That's the truth, isn't it?

A.    That is the truth.  There is research being spent � or money being spent on figuring out how to

15 make cigarettes less addictive.

Q.    And so as we sit here today, leaving aside 1994, leaving aside when the documents were available in the late '90s, as of today, the scientific community from the public health community, the Food and Drug

20 Administration that also regulates the tobacco

companies, correct?

A.    Right.

Q.    No one has been able to come up with a scientific consensus of whether there is a threshold of nicotine that creates and maintains addiction and, if

2340 so, what it is.  It doesn't exist right now, correct?

A.    I would disagree with that.  The level of less than 1 milligram in a rod unburned, because you can only extract so much out of the rod, which yields less than .005 milligrams of nicotine, which is a feasible amount, it's available in tobaccos that can be grown, so very, very, very low levels of nicotine, and they don't seem to support continued use of the product.  And that has been the subject of a lot of science that's going on.  There's nothing that � the FDA, just so you're aware, does not have the authority to eliminate nicotine in the product.  That was not something they were given authority to do.

Q.    I'm asking you, sir, and I apologize if I wasn't clear.  You cannot say that as we sit here today there is a scientific answer to the questions:  Is there a threshold of nicotine that creates addiction, and if so � and maintains it, or if so, what is it. That's the truth, isn't it? A.    No, it's not �

MR. GDANSKI:  One second.

MR. BASS:  Judge, I think it's a different question than what was asked.  Improper impeachment.

THE COURT:  All right.  If it is then Dr. Cummings will tell us.  Ask the question. BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    The question you were asked there:  "And the FDA is currently having research done that's looking into whether or not there are threshold levels of nicotine that they think may or may not sustain addiction, correct?"

And the answer you gave was a � that was

A.    Yes.

Q.    "Question:  The FDA as of right now is researching the issue of a nicotine level as a threshold for creating or maintaining addiction, right? "Answer:  Yes, they are."

Q.    Why don't you read, Doctor, the entire question and answer that they want read. A.    Sure.

"And the reason they're researching the issue is because it's not been established that there's a consensus, correct?"

Q.    No.  Excuse me.  You need to read that correctly, sir.  I'll read it.

"Question:  And the reason that they're researching the issue is because it's not been established, there's not a consensus, correct?

"Answer:  There's not a consensus.  There is evidence, certainly, I would say that evidence is not sufficient to give a particular [sic] number."

2345 MR. GDANSKI:  Specific.

BY MR. DAVIS:

Q.    "The evidence is pretty strong among adult

smokers that if you go below the threshold level of

0.5 [sic] milligrams of nicotine, that is not

sufficient to keep somebody smoking.  The concern is

about naive non-cigarette smokers, young people taking

up smoking, whether that level, low level of nicotine

will lead them into a period of smoking.  So the FDA

appropriately is being cautious in trying to figure out

what the threshold level would be.  It's not like

there's no evidence out there.  There certainly is.

13 And I'm following that evidence, and I have testified

to it at the .05 level many times.  With adult smokers it's pretty clear, below the .05 doesn't seem to be sufficient to maintain smoking behavior."

That was the question you were asked and the answer you gave, correct?

A.    Yes, sir.

Q.    Okay.  I think we've done that.

Last question.  You had mentioned, I think in connection with the movie placements, product placements, remember � I think you brought up The

2 4 Muppet Movie.

A.    Yes, on the list.

2346 Q.    There were no cigarettes in The Muppet

A.    It was on a list they were supplied to the producer of The Muppet Movie.

Q.    But there were no cigarettes in the Muppet

A.    I don't know.

Q.    You've never looked?

A.    No, I haven't.  I haven't looked at The

Q.    You testified about The Muppet Movie here in the context of cigarette product placements and you don't know whether or not they're in there.

A.    I don't.  I supplied � I think we showed a chart from Philip Morris that talked about products that had been supplied to movie producers and to the particular movies that they had been supplied to between 1978 and 1988.  And The Muppet Movie was on that along with a bunch of others, like the movie Grease I think was highlighted.  Did it year by year.

Q.    Let me just � at the time that you testified to this jury about cigarettes and The Muppet

23 Movie you had no basis as to whether or not cigarettes

were in that movie, correct?

A.    I haven't looked at The Muppet Movie.  It's

Q.    Understand that.  But the answer to my question is no, correct?

A.    The answer is I haven't looked. Q.    And therefore you had no basis when you gave that testimony for knowing one way or the other whether there were cigarettes in The Muppet Movie.

MR. BASS:  Objection, asked and answered. I think he answered it. If he answered it. He answered it. All right, sir.  Thank you very

CROSS EXAMINATION BY MR. PEDROSA:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, one of the brands that

15 Ms. Cooper smoked was Newport made by my client

Lorillard, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And that's the only brand made by Lorillard that she smoked, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And it was 1980 to 1984 is the period of time that she smoked Newports.

A.    Correct.

Q.    Now, you agree with me, Dr. Cummings, that every Newport that she smoked came from a pack that had

2349 a warning on it during those years.

A.    Sure.

Q.    And we've looked at some of the different warnings over the years.  From '80 to '84 it was always the same warning during that period, right?

A.    Right.

Q.    Can we put up that demonstrative, please? This is � I'll get out of your way. This is the warning that was in effect during the entire period of time that Ms. Cooper was smoking Newport cigarettes, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    "Warning:  The Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health."  And that was on all packs and all ads during that period of time, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    Great.  Let's switch gears, and now we're going to go farther back in time, all the way back to December of 1953.  Is that all right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    Yesterday with Mr. Belasic and I think the day before with Mr. Bass you discussed some scientific experiments that were done in the early 1950s where scientists were taking the tar from cigarettes and

A.    Yeah, they were doing it before then, but, yes .

Q.    And in the early 1950s there was widespread publicity in the popular media on some of these studies.  You showed the jury a magazine, Life Magazine from December 1953, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    John, can we put that up?

That's the Life Magazine cover that you showed the jury December 1953, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And Life Magazine sort of had a reputation or what it was was they tried to tell stories through pictures, and it's very famous for its pictures, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    In this particular article there's some pictures of scientists and the mice and the big picture at the top with the scientist, with the smoking machine that's Dr. Evarts Graham, right?

A.    Right.

Q.    And in the corner, if we could maybe blow that up a little bit, there's another person pictured there.  That's a woman named Adele Croninger, right?

A.    Correct.

	There's a very important member of this team

that's

that's

A.

Q.

A.
	Yes.

Q.

A.

Q.
	You knew him.  You actually knew him later

in lif

A.
	Obviously.  I was born in 1953.  But I did

work with Dr. Wynder in the '80s.  We did some grant
	
work t
	ogether.

Q.
	And you agree that he was a very famous and

well-respected scientist on smoking and health issues.
	
A.
	Sure .

Q.
	Now, you're aware that Lorillard actually

suppor
	ted some of Dr. Wynder's research.

A.
	Yes.

A.    True.

Q.    And if we go to the second page the author of the letter is H.B. Parmele.

A.    Right.

Q.    And you know who Dr. Parmele is, right?

A.    Yes, he was the director of research at Lorillard at the time.

Q.    At Lorillard, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And actually later on he went on to become vice president for research and development at Lorillard, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And what Dr. Parmele says to his colleague is in the highlighted passage that's up on the screen. "We're committed to furnish certain cancer investigators with 35,000 all tobacco cigarettes. Therefore, when ready they should be shipped to

Q. And Ms. Adele Croninger was the woman that we saw in the Life Magazine. She was holding up the two beakers with the cigarette tar, right?

A.    That's right.

Q. Now, you're aware that Lorillard continued to work or to do some work with Dr. Wynder for years after this, right?

A.    On and off.

Q.    On and off.

A.    Yep.  This is actually not with Wynder at the time.  I don't think Wynder was still at Washington University.

Q.    This is with Ms. Croninger who had just been working with Dr. Wynder and Dr. Graham and was pictured in the article.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And it was attended by scientist from Armour Research or ARF, and that's Dr. Adams and Dr. Laskowski, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And then he says, "In addition to the regular members of the steering committee, Dr. Wynder" � that's the same Dr. Wynder we've been talking about, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.     � "Dr. Hoffman and Ms. Lemm of the Sloan-Kettering Institute were also present."

A.    That's right.

Q.    And he says, "The primary purpose of the

15 meeting was to discuss the analytical method developed

by Dr. Hoffman for the analysis of cigarette smoke tar and to decide to what extent the availability of this

18 method will require changes in the ARF program."

Right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    Now, there's a bunch of references there � a couple references there to a Dr. Hoffman.  That's Dietrich Hoffman, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And Dietrich Hoffman was another one of the

A.    Sure.  He worked with Dr. Wynder.  He was an analytic chemist.

Q.    And you knew Dr. Hoffman as well, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    Now, at this time Dr. Hoffman was with the Sloan-Kettering Institute.

A.    Yes.

Q.    And the Sloan-Kettering Institute was and is a very well-respected cancer research institution.

A.    It's a cancer hospital and a research institution.

Q.    In New York, right?

A.    In New York City.

Q.    Now, in the 1960s Dr. Hoffman was already a leading expert on cigarette smoke chemistry, right?

A.    Yes, he was.

Q.    And you already mentioned that Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Wynder worked together for many, many years.

A.    Yes.

Q. And you've seen other documents like this one that also show that the two of them also worked with Lorillard off and on, as you've said, over the years.

A.    Yes.

Q.    So moving back to the letter.  After discussing Dr. Hoffman's method on page 2, Dr. Adams explained sort of what the plan is going forward; is that right?  There's a list 1, 2, 3.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And what he says the plan is going forward is, okay, Dr. Jensen and his guys at Lorillard are going to supply ARF with the benzene soluble portion of cigarette smoke condensate.  So we're talking about parts of the tar.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And then ARF, Armour Research, they're going to evaluate those tars, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And then on the basis of the ARF results they're going to decide which ones should be analyzed in more detail and they're going to send those to Dr. Hoffman at Sloan-Kettering, fair?

A.    Correct.

Q.    All right.  That's 1958.  So let's move forward a little bit into the 1960s.

A.    Okay.

Q.    You're familiar, right, Dr. Cummings that Lorillard during the 1960s was doing some research on a

	A.
	Yes.


	Q.
	And phenols were a class of compounds in

cig
	arette
	smoke.


	A.
	That's right.


	Q.
	And part of what was going on is they were

the
	tars
	that they could study, correct?

of

pot

	ly important in the development of cancer.


	A.
	Yes, they are.

	And you're aware that scientists at

Lorillard

Dr.

them from

BY MR. PEDROSA:
	
Q.
	So let's take a look at the � the date is

May 15th
	� I apologize, May 13th, 1960, right?

A.
	Right.

Q.
	And if we look at the very last page, the

author is
	A.W. Spears, research chemist.  You know that

Dr. Spears was a chemist at the time at Lorillard.
	
A.
	That's right.

Q.
	And Dr. Spears also went on to be director

of research at Lorillard, right?
	
A.
	Correct.

Q.
	And then he became vice president of

research
	at Lorillard.

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	And ultimately he became CEO of the company.

A.
	That's right.

Q.
	Many years after this.

A.
	True.

Q.
	So Dr. Spears is writing to Dr. Hoffman at

Sloan-Kettering.
	
A.
	Correct.

Q.
	And that's the same Dr. Hoffman that we

talked ab
	out and saw in the last document.

A.
	Yes.

Q.
	And at the very first paragraph of the

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=1153
2361

1 letter, if we could highlight that, John, Dr. Spears

2 writes, "Dear Dr. Hoffman, We are still attempting to

3 improve the method for the determination of phenols.

4 However, since you expressed a desire to apprise [sic]

5 the method and since some of the information may be of

6 use to you in the near future, I will describe the

7 method in detail at this time."

8           And then later on in the next paragraph, at

9 the end of the paragraph, he says, "Publication of the

10 data is expected to follow shortly after completion and

11 I will be happy to send you a manuscript."

12           Right?

13     A.    Yes.

14     Q.    So he's sharing some information with

15 Dr. Hoffman and he's saying, I haven't published this

16 yet but I plan to publish it when it's ready; is that

17 right?

18     A.    I guess.

19     Q.    And then after that there's several

20 sections.  The first one is entitled "Determination of

21 phenol in tobacco smoke condensate."  It's actually a

22 five-page letter, and pages 2, 3 and 4 read like you

23 would expect a letter from one chemist to another

24 chemist to read, right?

25     A.    It's describing a method.

Q.    Right.  And there's words like "extracts" and "flash evaporation" and "gas chromatography" things that I think if we went into on a Friday afternoon we'd see torches and pitchforks around.  So let's skip that, the scientific stuff in the letter and we'll go to the very last page.

A.    Okay.

Q.    And at the top of that page, this is page 5, Dr. Spears writes to Dr. Hoffman, "We're considering investigation of this fraction and would like your opinion on its importance."  And he's talking about one of the fractions that he was describing at the page before, right?

A.    Right.

Q.    And he says, "Dr. Wynder and you indicated at my last visit to New York that a cooperative effort

17 may afford answers concerning the carcinogenicity of

tar more quickly.  If you have already started an investigation of this fraction, I would be most happy to give you any help that I can and concentrate my efforts on other fractions."

So Dr. Spears is offering to help Dr. Hoffman with his research, fair?

A.    Yeah.

Q.    Right after that, the next line, he says,

Correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And that article is entitled "Incomplete carcinogens in cigarette smoke condensate tumor promotion by a phenolic fraction."  Right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And that's talking about the role of phenols in potentially causing cancer.

A.    That's right.

Q.    Have you seen that article?

A.    I think I have.

Q.    Now, Dr. Spears � this is 1960.  Dr. Spears from Lorillard actually went on to publish two articles about phenols in cigarette smoke, right?

A.    Yes, the method, I think, for measuring them.

Q.    And those were published in 1963.

A.    I believe that's true.

Q.    Do you want to � would you like to see them?

A.    No, we can spare the �

MR. PEDROSA:  Dr. Cummings, I'm embarrassed to say I'm a little bit shorthanded on this one so is it okay if I give you one that is highlighted.

THE WITNESS:  Sure.  It will make it easier

MR. PEDROSA:  Great. BY MR. PEDROSA:

Q.    Okay.  Can we put that one up?

First off, let's look at the date.  This is

15 April 23rd, 1968, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And this one is on the letterhead of the Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research.

A.    That's right.

Q.    And let's look at the last � well, it's not the last page, because there's some charts and graphs, but it's the second page.  And there's a signature there, Dietrich H.  We know that's Dietrich Hoffman, right?

Q.    And so this letter is addressed from Dr. Hoffman to Dr. Spears, who by this time has become director of research and development for Lorillard, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    Dr. Hoffman writes to Dr. Spears at Lorillard.  He says, "Dear Alex, Enclosed please find the data for tumor initiating activity of BI, its subfractions as well as the BAP controls after four or five months of testing."

Basically he's saying here's some data, right?

A.    Right.

Q.    And I'm not going to go into what BI is or BAP is.  That's more chemist to chemist, right?

A.    Well, they're looking at different fractions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Q.    Spears and Hoffman?

A.    That's right.  Trying to figure out what it is in this chemical mix that is carcinogenic.

Q.    Right.  And so Dr. Hoffman then writes, "Seeing the data, one can certainly say that they reflect the excellent and most skillful work of the chemists responsible for the separations." Right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And then if we look at the end of that letter on the second page, Dr. Hoffman says, "We hope to see you in New York this Thursday or Friday so that we may discuss the studies to complete the series � these series.  With best wishes to you and your family, I am Dietrich Hoffman."

A.    Yes.

Q.    Dietrich H. actually.

A.    Correct.

Q.    Very friendly, they've been working together for several years by this point.

A.    Well, they weren't working that closely, but they were certainly sharing some information as to the chemistry of the product and the carcinogens that had been identified in the cigarettes.

Q.    Great.  Last topic.  And the last topic I want to ask you about is product placement in movies of cigarettes.

A.    Sure.

A.    Oh, too bad.

Q.    I know.  I really wanted to be able to ask you some interesting questions, but instead I'm going to ask you about Lorillard.

A.    Sure.

Q.    Dr. Cummings, you're aware that by the early 1970s Lorillard had actually adopted a policy of refusing requests by producers of motion pictures to use Lorillard cigarettes in motion picture, right?

A.    Yes, I am.

Q.    Now, in the early 1970s there was no law or regulation that prohibited product placement in movies, correct?

A.    There was no law.  It was a voluntary advertising code from the manufacturers that said they wouldn't market their products to children or �

Q.    Right.

A.    � use things like product placements and such.

Q.    But in addition to that voluntary code, Lorillard had its own specific voluntary policy at least by the early 1970s against including cigarettes

A.    Lorillard did not do product placements in featured films, as far as I know, from the 1970s.

Q.    And you've actually seen some examples of letters where Lorillard is writing to movie producers saying either no, do not use our cigarettes, or please take our cigarettes out, things of that nature, right?

A.    Yes, I have.

Q.    I just want to look at one example because I don't want to spend a lot of time on this.  But that one is LOR 3388.

Q.    And the date of this letter is March 23rd, 1973.

A.    Okay.

Q.    And if we look at the second page the author is Curtis Judge.  And you know Mr. Judge was the CEO of Lorillard, correct?

A.    Right.  I think we saw his name on one of other Lorillard documents.

2369 And he's writing to someone named Milton B. Scott at a company called United Visuals Corporation, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And in the first paragraph he sort of explains the background of the letter.  He says, "At your request I met with Mr. J. Bernstein in my office on March 2nd, 1973.  And at that time Mr. Bernstein proposed to me, among other things, the promotion of Lorillard's cigarettes products through their use in

film or property was mentioned."  Right?

A.    I think The Last of Sheila.

Q.    Well, later on he says subsequently we talked about The Last of Sheila, but at that first

16 meeting it wasn't a particular movie.

A.    Right.

Q.    And then on page 2 at the top of the page in the first paragraph he sets out Lorillard's position. He says, "Lorillard has absolutely no interest in sponsoring or in any way fostering, directly or indirectly, the use of our tobacco products in any films.  Furthermore, we emphatically prefer that they not be used."  And then it's signed "very truly yours" � or it's signed off "very truly yours,

Q.    My name is Kelly Luther.  We've met before. You know I represent Liggett Group, right? A.    Yes.

Q.    As Mr. Pedrosa did, I'm going to start by taking you back to the 1950s. A.    Okay. Q.    We talked quite a bit about it through the

2371 course of the past four days.  You talked about a

2 [meeting at the Plaza Hotel in 1953 where the heads of

3 the tobacco companies met, and you explained that

4 Liggett was not present at that meeting, correct?

5     A.    Correct.

6     Q.    And we refer to that as the Plaza Hotel

7 [meeting for simplicity purposes, okay? A.    Sure

9     Q.    That meeting was held shortly after

10 Dr. Wynder's mouse skin-paintings were published in

11 1953, correct?

12     A.    Yeah.  It was � his study was published in

13 June and the meeting was December.

14     Q.    Okay.  Liggett was invited to attend that

15 [meeting, correct?

A.    True.

Q.    But Liggett declined to attend that meeting.

A.    True.

Q.    And as a product of that meeting The Frank Statement was published, correct?

A.    True.

Q.    And you showed the jury The Frank Statement � it was up on the screen � and all of the names of the signatories to that Frank Statement, correct?

20 21 22 23 24 25

2372

1     A.    Correct.

2     Q.    And Liggett was not one of those

3 signatories, correct?

4     A.    Correct

5     Q.    Beginning in 1953 instead of joining the

6 Tobacco Industry Research Committee or the TIRC, you'll

7 see it referred to as both, Liggett chose to sponsor research being performed by many groups, including

9 |Arthur D. Little, correct?

10     A.    Yeah, Arthur D. Little actually before 1953

11 was doing work for Liggett and Myers.  It was their

12 primary contract lab that they used.

13     Q.    And Arthur D. Little had a reputation as one

14 of the most premier research firms in the world at the

15 time, correct?

16     A.    Sure

17     Q.    They did work for other industries and

18 industry leaders such as General Electric, General

19 iMotors and Johnson & Johnson, correct?

A.    I think I've heard that from you in the past, yes.

Q.    And you don't dispute that, do you?

A.    No, I don't.

Q.    And, in fact, NASA hired Arthur D. Little to conduct research on its behalf as well, correct?

A.    That's what I've heard.

Q.    And you don't dispute that either, do you?

A.    I do not.

Q.    Now, Arthur D. Little began its research by conducting mouse skin-painting studies like Dr. Wynder, correct?

A.    To replicate the Wynder experiments, yes.

Q.    And they collaborated with Dr. Wynder in doing that research, didn't they?

A.    I believe Dr. Kensler did, yes, from

Q.    And this is in the mid 1950s, correct?

A.    Yes.

Q. And in approximately 1962, I believe you told the jury that President Kennedy appointed the advisory committee to the Surgeon General, correct?

A.    Right.  June of 1962.

Q.    Okay.  And in 1963 � this is the reason for the paper � Liggett tendered to the Surgeon General's advisory committee a nine-volume submission of the research that it had performed collaboratively with

22 Arthur D. Little over the past 9 or 10 years, correct?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And you've seen this document before, have you not?

	And this is Liggett's nine-volume submission

to
	the Surgeon General's advisory committee, is it not?
	

	A.
	Correct.  Plus Dr. Kensler gave a

presentation, I believe, to the advisory committee.
		

	
	MS. LUTHER:  Judge, this is Liggett's


	
	Exhibit 231 for � I'm not admitting it into


	
	evidence, just for identification at this point.


	
	THE COURT:  Okay.  We'll hold it for now and


	
	you can move it in later.


	
	MS. LUTHER:  Great.


	
	Tammy, if could you pull 231 up, please.  Oh


	
	you know what, I take that back.  I don't want


	
	231.


	
	Let's look at instead at 2398.

BY
	MS.
	LUTHER:


	Q.
	You just touched on Dr. Kensler's oral

presentation, correct?
		

	
	MR. BASS:  Could we see a copy of that?


	
	MS. LUTHER:  Sure.  Sorry, Hardee.  And I

BY

	LUTHER:


	Q.
	This is minutes of a meeting that reflect

22 23

24

2375 Dr. Kensler's oral presentation to the Surgeon

General's advisory committee, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And if you look up on the screen it's 2398.

Education and Welfare Public Health Service, correct?

A.    Yep.

Q.    And it's dated July 2nd, 1963.  And it is to the liaison representatives to the Surgeon General's

A.    Correct.

Q.    And it's from James Hundley, who at the time was the Assistant Surgeon General for operations, correct?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And it reflects that it's the minutes of the last meeting from May 3rd through 4th, 1963, right?

A.    Right.  So they're summarizing what was presented.

Q.    And then if we go to the second page of the

21 minutes, which is actually the third page of the

document, it's kind of an old document so it's not easy to read, but the minutes reflect "Dr. Charles Kensler," and then there are a couple of illegible words "the

25 Arthur D. Little Company then presented work which they

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221

6 meeting.  Although Dr. Kensler reviewed some of the

2376 had undertaken on behalf of Liggett and Myers.  Their very extensive data will be presented in nine volumes identified as S-40(l) to (9).  Six volumes were received in advance of this meeting.  Note:  S-40(l) and (8) were delivered to the committee after the

data in S-40(8) which related to ciliary action and cigarette smoke.  S-40(9) discussion is still yet to be received."

Correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And then it goes on on the next page to state "These minutes cannot possibly record the massive amount of data in these reports." Correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    "However, two or three points especially pertinent to the committee's work might be mentioned. Cigar smoke condensate is just as carcinogenic on mouse skin as is condensate from cigarette smoke."

A.    Yes.

Q.    "And condensate from filtered smoke is just as or almost as carcinogenic as that from unfiltered smoke."

Correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Now, I got a little ahead of myself with the nine-volume submission.  So I'm going to go back to that now.

You confirmed that Liggett did provide the nine-volume submission.  We just talked about this. You've seen the submission before, correct?

A.    That's right.

MS. LUTHER:  And as I said, Judge, this is Liggett's Exhibit 231 for identification. BY MS. LUTHER:

Q.    You recognize this as the cover sheet.  And you've identified the actual submission already, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    Now, the cover page notes � Tammy, this is 231, if you could pull that up � that it was prepared for the Surgeon General's Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health by the research department of Liggett and

24 Myers Tobacco Company and Arthur D. Little, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And then the preface of this goes on to state, "This report has been prepared for the information of the Surgeon General's committee on smoking in an attempt to make available to the committee in a useful form the findings acquired in the collaborative research programs undertaken in the research laboratories of Arthur D. Little � or Liggett and Myers and Arthur D. Little, Inc.  The emphasis in this program since its initiation early in 1954 has been to learn more about the physical, chemical and biological properties of cigarette smoke in order to develop knowledge of possible hazardous properties and, if found, to devise means of reducing them without impairing the ability of the product to provide the pleasurable effects for which it is generally used." Correct?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And due to the extensive research and cooperation that Liggett gave the Surgeon General the advisory committee praised Liggett for its contribution, did it not?

A.    Sure.  Everybody who submitted anything got a letter praising them.

Q.    And the research Liggett provided as part of this nine-volume submission and allowing the advisory

2379 committee researchers to go to Arthur D. Little and see the work that was being performed as well as their oral presentations, the research was cited as authority throughout the 1964 Surgeon General's Report, wasn't it?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And the report itself actually acknowledges Liggett's contribution, doesn't it?

A.    Yes, it does.  The '64 report you're referring to, yeah.

Q.    Yeah.  Thank you for that clarification. Turning to Liggett's Exhibit 219 for identification.

MS. LUTHER:  Hardee, if I can hand you this copy.

And just so it's clear for the record, Judge, Mr. Gdanski and I have already discussed these exhibits and he has no objection to their introduction when they are ultimately offered in Liggett's case.

THE COURT:  Okay. BY MS. LUTHER:

Q.    Exhibit 219, I know you've seen it before because we've discussed it, but if you'd like a copy I'll be happy to provide it to you.

A.    They were involved, sure. Q.    Exhibit 6965. Hardee.

And there's a little more information on this so let me hand you this one, Doctor.

You recognize this document, Doctor? A.    Yep, I've seen it before.

Q.    And this was written by C.F. Woodward, chief tobacco laboratory at the United States Department of

18 Agriculture, correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And the document reflects that Liggett's nine-volume submission was shared with the Department of Agriculture, correct?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And according to this document, it's dated � well, let's see, what is it dated?  I don't

A.    Correct.

Q.    And according to this document, in the first paragraph, "To the best of our knowledge the Liggett nine-volume submission was the only report prepared by industrial interests for the benefit of the Surgeon General's advisory committee." Correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And then it goes on to say that "Liggett's Surgeon General submission report totals 705 pages and comprises the following parts:  Introduction, the nature of cigarette smoke, chemical compounds of cigarette smoke and biological activity, long-term inhalation experiments with cigarette smoke, the effects of gases in the cigarette smoke on mammalian ciliary activities and a discussion and summary." Correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And then it goes on to say, "The report contains a wealth of information especially with regard to the biological responses of animal systems to cigarette smoke." Yes?

Q.    And then it also goes on to indicate that there were actually articles that were published in the public domain in the scientific community regarding some of these studies, correct?

A.    Actually, the studies were comparing the use of charcoal filters, which was a Liggett brand, Lark cigarette.

Q.    Well, let's look at the titles.  The first one is "Components of cigarette smoke with ciliary depressant activity," correct?

It's towards the bottom of the page.

A.    Yeah, the first one is containing activated charcoal granules.

Q.    Okay.  And the next one is "Cigarette smoke: Charcoal filters reduce components that inhibit growth of the cultured human cells." Right?

A.    That's right.  Although that's not a peer-reviewed publication � oh no, that's Science, I believe.  That is a peer-reviewed publication.

Q.    And on the next page, "Chemical and physical factors affecting mammalian ciliary activity." Correct?

A.    Yes.  Similarly looking at the charcoal

Q.    Mr. Woodward goes on to say, "In view of the voluminous amount of material contained in the report, it would be impossible to record here the many findings obtained in a 10-year period of productive collaboration."

Correct?

A.    True.

Q.    And goes on to say, "The Arthur D. Little Company is exceptionally well-equipped and staffed to undertake the biological evaluation of the activities of cigarette smoke condensate fractions and compounds." Correct?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And Mr. Woodward actually recommends that strong consideration should be given to the government actually retaining Arthur D. Little in its efforts as well, correct?

A.    That's right.

Q. Now, I want to look at Plaintiff's Exhibit 2138 that you discussed with Mr. Bass on your direct examination, the L&M Perspective Review?

A.    Sure, from Arthur D. Little.

Q.    Right.  Would you like a copy?

Q.    You pulled up and showed to the jury � this is 2138, Tammy.  Just that � if you could pull down number 1 A through B.  Paragraph 1, sub A through D. Just that first paragraph there.

You highlighted this paragraph for the jury when you discussed this document, correct?

A.    Sure.

Q.    And actually, before I go there, you agree that carcinogenic means cancer-causing, right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And if a substance is applied to the backs of mice and those mice develop tumors that would indicate that the substance has the potential to cause cancer in humans?

A.    That's one of way of testing it, yes.

Q.    Now, going back to the L&M Perspective. This document is dated March 15th, 1951, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And it is on Arthur D. Little letterhead, correct?

A.    Right.

Q.    The document does not indicate who authored

A.    No.  This particular document does not; although there is testimony in other cases that it does discuss that.

Q.    Well, we don't know on the face of the document who the author of this is, correct?

A.    Not on the face of the document.

Q.    And the document does not contain the name of a recipient of this memo either, correct?

A.    No, it doesn't.

Q.    So actually, on the face of this document there's no indication that it was ever sent to anybody; isn't that right?

A.    We don't know whether it was sent to anyone, that's true.

Q.    Now, looking at the paragraph that you shared with the jury, the author writes, "There are biologically active materials present in cigarette tobacco.  These are, A, cancer-causing; B, cancer-promoting; C, poisonous; D, stimulating, pleasurable and flavorful." Correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And it's your contention that Liggett did not share information to this effect with the public

2387 health community.  Is that what you testified to on direct examination?

A.    Yes, that document was not part of the submission to the Surgeon General's committee.

Q.    But the information contained in that first paragraph was shared with the Surgeon General's committee, was it not?

A.    Well, they did share their animal research. They didn't share their conclusions that there are carcinogenic chemicals that are identified that cause cancer that are cancer-promoting and poisonous.  I believe Liggett's position was that cigarette smoke did not cause cancer.

Q.    It's your testimony as you sit here today that Liggett did not share with the Surgeon General the results of the mouse skin-painting studies that it did in collaboration with Arthur D. Little that demonstrated that painting tar condensate on the backs of mice did, in fact, produce tumors; is that your testimony?

A.    No, that's not my testimony, no.

Q.    Okay.  The information contained in the nine-volume submission actually covered all of those areas, did it not?

A.    Covered all those areas?  No, I don't

Q.    Well, the submission will be in evidence, so the jury can take a look at that.

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative. THE COURT:  Just ask questions, please. MS. LUTHER:  Yes, sir. BY MS. LUTHER:

Q.    So let's talk about one last issue, and we'll try and get the jury on its way.

You talked a lot about trade groups, and I want to make sure that we're clear on a few points. Liggett was never a member of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee when it was known by that name, correct?

A.    Well, when it was known by that name that would be correct.  They joined when they became CTR, the same organization.

Q.    I'm going there, Doctor.  Don't jump ahead of me.

Liggett was a full member, only a full

23 member of the Council for Tobacco Research from March

1964 until January 1968, correct?

A.    Could you clarify full member?

THE COURT:  Don't ask her questions, Doctor. Start again.  If he doesn't know, just say, I can't answer the way it's phrased and let her rephrase it. BY MS. LUTHER:

Q.    Liggett joined the Council for Tobacco Research as a full dues paying member in March of 1964, and it resigned from the Council for Tobacco Research as a full dues paying member in January of 1968, correct?

A.    Well, they continued to pay �

MS. LUTHER:  Your Honor, I would request that Dr. Cummings be instructed to answer the question as it was phrased, please.

MR. BASS:  And then he can explain his answer as he feels he needs to.

THE COURT: The initial question is a yes or no. If you're able to answer it that way, or if you need to offer an explanation you can.

MS. LUTHER:  Would you like to have the court reporter read it back, Dr. Cummings? THE WITNESS:  The answer would be yes.

Q.    I'm going there, Dr. Cummings.  You'll have an opportunity to talk about that.

So in CTR's approximately 50-year existence, Liggett was a full member of the CTR for only a little over three years, correct?

A.    They paid in from 1964 till it went out of business in 1998.

Q.    Could you answer the question as I posed it, please, Dr. Cummings?

MR. BASS:  Objection, argumentative.  He did answer the question.

MS. LUTHER:  No, he didn't.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Everybody stop.  Are you able to answer the question the way it's phrased, Dr. Cummings?

THE WITNESS:  I thought I did. THE COURT:  The answer stands.  The jury will determine what weight to give it. What's the next question, please? MS. LUTHER:  Actually, Judge, I would like

2391 to rephrase this question and have Dr. Cummings answer the question that I'm posing.  He knows exactly what I'm talking about. THE COURT:  Okay, don't � BY MS. LUTHER:

Q. In the CTR's approximately 50-year existence Liggett was a full member of the CTR for only a little over three years; isn't that correct, Doctor?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Now, on your direct exam you mentioned special projects.

A.    Yes.

Q. And you mentioned that Liggett continued to contribute to special projects after it resigned from the CTR as a full member; isn't that right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Now, Liggett only funded those special projects on a case-by-case basis, correct?

A.    True.

Q. And you also told the jury about the Tobacco Institute during your direct examination, correct?

A.    Yes.

Q.    That was formed in 1958, correct?

A.    Spun out of the TIRC, yes.

Q.    And there were anywhere from 12 to 15

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=1184
2392

1 companies involved in that organization in any given

2 year, right?

3     A.    The Tobacco Institute, no.  It was the major

4 cigarette companies that funded it.  There may have

5 been other organizations involved, but the funding came

6 from the major cigarette companies based on market

7 share.

8     Q.    I didn't ask about funding.  I asked about

9 membership.  There were anywhere from 12 to 15

10 companies involved in that organization in any given

11 year, correct?

12     A.    Yes.

13     Q.    And just about every one in the tobacco

14 industry was a member of the Tobacco Institute,

15 correct?

16     A.    Sure.

17     Q.    Even tobacco farmers were members.

18     A.    Well, there was an association that was

19 represented in the Tobacco Institute; although they

20 didn't contribute funding.  It came from the cigarette

21 companies.

22     Q.    Tobacco farmers were members of the Tobacco

23 Institute, correct?

2393 Growers. BY MS. LUTHER:

Q.    Now, Liggett's financial contribution to the Tobacco Institute was less than half of 1 percent of the total; isn't that right?

A.    True.

Q.    Approximately 3 percent; isn't that right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And similarly, Liggett's contribution to the Council for Tobacco Research from 1966 to 1990 was only about .79 percent; isn't that right?

A.    I don't know.

Q.    Do you recall being asked that question in the Buchanan trial?

A.    I don't recall it.

Q.    Would you like to see your testimony?

A.    I don't dispute that I answered that question.  I mean, Liggett was a minor player.  It was based on market share.

Q.    So you would not dispute as you sit here today that Liggett's contribution was only .79 percent of the budget of the CTR from 1966 to 1990, correct?

A.    I don't recall it offhand, but I don't dispute it.

6     Q.    Would you agree that today Liggett only has

7 about 2 percent of the overall cigarette market?

8           MR. BASS:  Objection, relevance.

9           THE WITNESS:  Yes.

17 examination that Liggett admitted that smoking causes

18 disease for the first time in 1997.  Do you recall that

19 testimony?

20     A.    Yes.

21     Q.    Would you be surprised to learn that the

22 date was actually 1996?

23     A.    No.  It was � I'm familiar with the

24 president of Liggett and Myers at the time, Bennett

A.    No apology required.

Q.    The stat 60 million smokers have quit has been referenced numerous times by the defense in this case, correct?

A.    True.

Q.    Remind us how that stat was compiled, please.

A.    Two questions:  Have you smoked 100 cigarettes in your lifetime?  If you answer yes to that question then you're asked a follow-up question:  Do you currently smoke every day or some days or not at all?  If you answer not at all then you're classified as a former smoker, ex-smoker.

Q.    Now, is Mary Cooper part of that statistic?

A.    She would be counted as a former smoker.

A.    Yes.

Q.    Do smokers and ex-smokers also get diagnosed with smoking-related diseases every day?

A.    Yes, they do.

Q.    On direct we talked about how many smokers die each year and how many have died since 1964.  How many smokers get diagnosed with smoking-related diseases every day?

A.    Well, the number of people alive with a smoking-caused disease is about 20 times the number who die every year from smoking.  So 484,000 deaths this year times 20 is the estimate of the number of people alive with a smoking-caused disease today in the United States.

Q.    Of the 60 million who have quit smoking, how

17 many have been diagnosed with lung cancer?

A.    Of the 60 million?  You know, I don't know. It's not the majority.  Actually there are many diseases that are caused by smoking, but lung cancer is certainly a significant contributor.  I don't know the answer to that question, though.

Q.    I guess a better way to ask it.  Of the 60

24 million who have quit, many of them have been diagnosed

with lung cancer, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    What did the companies not turn over to the Surgeon General in 1964?

A.    Well, they didn't turn over their conclusion in 1958 that they had determined that cigarette smoking was the cause of lung cancer.  They did not turn over to the Surgeon General their findings in the late '50s and early '60s that they could not remove all of the classes of carcinogenic chemicals that are found in tobacco products.  They did not turn over to the Surgeon Generals their findings that filters were not effective.  They did not turn over to the Surgeon General the evidence that they had that their product caused physiological addiction and that nicotine was a drug and they were in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug.

Q.    Since the release of the internal documents, has the Surgeon General actually cited to internal company documents in reports?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Why?

A.    Well, it's a new source of data.  That's why I looked at the original documents.  It was new information to either validate or refute theories, hypotheses that we had.  And it was new information,

2402 frankly, about what was known, when it was known and what the effect of what was done on smokers in the population to help us understand why we have, you know, a tobacco epidemic in this country.

Q.    You were asked some questions about I think the 1981 Surgeon General Report, the 1982 Surgeon General Report by Mr. Belasic, and there might have been a third one.  Do you recall those questions?

A.    Yeah.

Q.    Regarding the 1981 Surgeon General's Report I think you were asked questions about whether it was the Surgeon General's recommendation that if a smoker can't quit they should switch to filter and/or light cigarettes, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Why did the Surgeon General make that recommendation in 1981, and is it still the recommendation that the Surgeon General makes today?

A.    Okay.  The answer is why they made that � first of all, they were only recommending it for people who didn't quit.  Their recommendation was, don't start, and if you do smoke, quit.  But if you were going to continue to smoke, smoke a cigarette with filter or low tar based on the scientific evidence that was available at the time.  So that's why they made

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=1195
6 more health concerned, they were more likely to end up

7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

2403 that recommendation.

They don't make that recommendation today

because the early studies, as I tried to explain,

really the early groups that switched to the low-tar

filtered cigarettes, and they were different, they were

quitting eventually anyway, and the early studies seemed to show that they were healthier and slightly lower risk than those smoking the unfiltered or the regular cigarettes.

What we really needed was a long-term follow-up study, because it takes a long time for these diseases to occur.  And there's a 50-year follow-up where they compared cohorts of smokers recruited in the '50s with cohorts groups, millions of smokers, recruited in the '80s, and even more recently, and they looked at their mortality rates.  And the relative risk, as I had pointed out, have gone up.  So as the cigarettes went from unfiltered to filtered, filtered to lower machine yield cigarettes, the risks of smoking have increased.  And that's why the Surgeon General does not recommend that anybody switch to filtered or low-tar cigarettes, because there's no benefit and there may be � the evidence is suggesting it's a higher risk.

2406 THE COURT:  Finish your objection, please.

MR. DAVIS:  One more, Your Honor.  This whole increased risk on new science that has come out in 2010 is completely irrelevant to Ms. Cooper.  It all relates to adenocarcinoma. She doesn't have it.  It's science that's been developed since she quit smoking.  It is � it's just irrelevant to the case.

MR. GDANSKI:  To speed things up can I argue?

THE COURT:  Let me read this first, just a sec.

Is this the part that you want to read? MR. GDANSKI:  Right now that's all he wants to read, page 20.

THE COURT:  Objection is overruled. (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the following proceedings were held in open court:) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, did the 2010 Surgeon General's Report say, "In contrast to industry awareness, the various ways that cigarettes were physically modified and the nature and level of compensation in response to design changes were not well understood by parties outside of the tobacco industry itself.

2407 officials had little basis to anticipate the degree to which manufacturers could design cigarettes to allow smokers to draw more smoke and nicotine from cigarettes than was represented by machine measured yields of tar and nicotine."

Right?

A.    Yes.

Q.    That was the � was that the change or one of the changes from the 1981 recommendation to now?

A.    Yes.

Q.    We saw testimony from Mr. Johnston of RJ Reynolds.  Mr. Belasic showed a statement rather that

13 Mr. Johnston read, correct?

A.    Correct.

Q.    It referenced caffeine, tea and coffee, correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    How many people die each year from coffee?

A.    I don't know if anybody does.

Q.    How many die each year from drinking tea?

A.    I don't know if anybody does.

Q.    Now, Mr. Belasic talked to you about the changing definition of addiction or the evolution to 1988 in the Surgeon General's Report, correct?

A.    Correct.

240 Q.    Did the companies know well before 1988 that nicotine was addictive? A.    Yes.

Q. Why did they go to great lengths, including going before Congress and denying it, to downplay the addictiveness of nicotine?

MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor. Speculation, state-of-mind testimony.

THE COURT:  As to those two grounds it's overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Why did they do that? Basically they can't defend the diseases that are caused by smoking, because if somebody is addicted they don't have a free choice.  It's not a free choice to be a smoker.  It's a constrained choice; that's what addiction is. So they were defending their profits and their sale of cigarettes. BY MR. BASS:

Q. We heard about the Great American Smoke-Out, and we saw at least one public service announcement on that, correct?

A.    Couple of them, yeah.

Q.    What was the industry's position regarding the need for the Great American Smoke-Out?

A.    Well, they had a � they didn't think it was necessary.  In fact, they created a counter-campaign called The Great American Smoke-In.

Q.    And tell us about that, please.

A.    Well, they had celebrities that they utilized that would talk about how silly the process was, and they created support kits and so on to help smokers get through the day without being harangued by nonsmokers advising them to quit.

Q.    What about with respect to when pharmaceuticals like nicotine gum came out on the

to that?

A.    The industry, one, denied that cigarettes were addictive.  But with regard to Nicorette Gum, when it first came out, it was sold by a company called

17 Merrell Dow, Dow Chemical, they were the first

distributor.  And they also provided chemicals to the cigarette manufacturers, specifically Philip Morris.

THE COURT:  I sustain the objection in light of the answer.

Ladies and gentlemen, you should disregard the remarks of the witness and give it no weight during your deliberations. Next question, please. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Dr. Cummings, you were talking at the end with Ms. Luther about Liggett's involvement with CTR and TIRC and she was talking about full member and you were talking about something else.  So please explain what you were referring to.

A.    Liggett continued to fund the CTR from 1964 to 1998, so they were a contributing member.  They did not attend all of the meetings.  They selectively funded special projects, which were the projects selected by the lawyers to be used to create the controversy about smoking and health.

Q.    And over what period of time did this occur? A.    Well, they continued to � well, between 1965 is when special projects really got launched and

2411 until they went out of business in 1998.  They were a contributor to CTR during that period.

Q. Mr. Pedrosa showed you some documents from Lorillard and Dr. Spears. Was Lorillard part of the conspiracy?

A.    Yes.

MR. PEDROSA:  Objection.  That's legal argument.

THE COURT:  I'll let him give the opinion. Overruled.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, Lorillard was part of the conspiracy. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Was Liggett as well? A.    Yes.

Q.    We heard something about the Tobacco Working Group or TWG.  Why did Tobacco Working Group stop or cease?

A.    Essentially because they couldn't find a less hazardous cigarette.  So the National Cancer Institute invested money to try to evaluate ways to design cigarettes that would be less hazardous, and they concluded you couldn't.  So after 10 years they gave up on it and they moved on to efforts to try to educate people to try to quit smoking and develop

A.    He left the National Cancer Institute and began to work for the cigarette companies as a consultant to them.

Q.    Do you have an opinion as to whether or not the industry would spend 250 billion dollars from 1940 to 2005 if advertising did not work?

MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor.  Beyond the scope of expertise.

THE COURT:  On those grounds it's overruled. MR. DAVIS:  It's beyond the scope of cross. THE COURT:  On those grounds it's overruled. THE WITNESS:  Yes, I do have an opinion. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And what is your opinion? A.    They wouldn't unless it worked. Q.    You were asked some questions about why Mary Cooper smoked filtered cigarettes.  Did you see evidence in the record about why Ms. Cooper smoked filtered cigarettes?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And what is that evidence?

A.    She saw advertising for filtered cigarettes and thought they were safer.

Q.    We know that Ms. Cooper switched to lights in 1995, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Is there evidence from Ms. Cooper and in the record as to why after switching to lights Ms. Cooper continued to smoke lights?

A.    Yes.

Q.    Okay.  And what is that evidence?

A.    She continued to smoke lights because, you know, she was addicted.

Q.    Mr. Davis asked you about whether Ms. Cooper saw ads for lights, and there was the question of whether we could include the pack as an advertisement or not.  Is the pack itself an advertisement?

A.    Yes, of course.  It's carefully designed and constructed.  Light cigarette packs have a smaller chevron on it, more white space.  It's all through

22 market research, very detailed from inside

Philip Morris to communicate that it was cleaner, safer, better for smokers. They knew exactly how smokers perceived it.

Q.
	There were some questions from Mr. Belasic,

I think i
	t was yesterday, about how often or how many

times Mar
	y Cooper saw the warning on cigarettes.  Do

you remember those questions?
	
A.
	Yes.

Q.
	In your direct examination we admitted into

evidence
	a 1967 FTC report and a 1981 FTC report,

right?
	

A.
	That's right.

Q.
	On cross Mr. Belasic showed you just the

1967 FTC
	report, right?

A.
	That's right.

Q.
	Did the 1981 FTC report also address the

effectiveness of warnings?
	
A.
	Yes.

Q.
	Okay.  And what did it discuss regarding the

effectiveness of warnings?
	
A.
	Basically discussed the fact that the

majority
	of smokers were ill-informed about the health

risks of
	smoking and that the warning labels needed to

be enhanced.
	
Q.
	Now, when Mr. Belasic was asking you

questions
	about the 1967 report that was approximately

a year or
	so after the 1966 caution labels came out,

right?

Q. Now, the 1981 report, though, was 15 years after, right?

A.    That's right.

Q. Were the � regarding the effectiveness of the warning labels, was the information concluded in 1967 virtually the same as it was in 1981?

MR. BELASIC:  Your Honor, can I object.  I don't know why this is up on the screen.

THE COURT:  Don't put exhibits up unless they're called for, please.  Thank you.

MR. BASS:  Judge, at this time we'd ask to show what's in evidence the portion of the 1981 FTC report.

THE COURT:  You can do that. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    I think this is what was on the screen before, Dr. Cummings.  I'm sorry I didn't call it out. But is this what you were talking about regarding the 1981 FTC report? A.    Yes.

Q.    Could you read that to the members of the jury, please.

A.    "While most Americans are generally aware that smoking is hazardous, some consumers, especially

2417 smokers, do not know the basic fact.  However, even if it is assumed that every consumer is aware that smoking is hazardous, the evidence indicates that many consumers do not have enough information about the health risks of smoking in order to know how dangerous smoking is, what is the nature and extent of the health risks of smoking.  Many consumers also do not know whether the general health risks of smoking have any personal relevance to themselves or whether they are among the groups of people who may be uniquely vulnerable to those [sic] healths hazards."

Q.    Regardless of how many times Mary Cooper saw the warnings from 1966 until the late 1990s or 2000 when she quit, up until the late 1990s was the industry trying to create doubt in the minds of smokers about the health hazards of smoking?

MR. BELASIC:  It's argumentative. THE COURT:  You can answer.  Overruled. THE WITNESS:  Yes. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Do you have an opinion as to why?

A. Because doubt was the way they kept people smoking, gave people an excuse, a rationalization or crutch to keep lighting up.

Q.    Now, Mr. Belasic showed you an 1887 article

241 from, I think, the Chicago Medical Journal?

A.    Correct.

Q.    And the 1906 Health Notes, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    And I think both of those, one might have referenced addiction and one of them might have referenced inhalability, right?

A.    Correct.

Q.    What changed about the inhalability and the addictiveness of cigarettes in 1913?

A.    The introduction of Camel cigarettes with the American blend, particularly the use of flue-cured tobacco along with Burley and Turkish tobacco made the delivery of nicotine more readily available by making the cigarette more inhalable.  Before that most cigarettes had been a single blend either low nicotine yield or too harsh to inhale.  And so cigarette sales took off.

Other companies came in, like American came in with Lucky Strike, Liggett and Myers with Chesterfield, Philip Morris with its Philip Morris brand and Old Golds for Lorillard.  And cigarettes really took off as a result of people not just smoking occasionally, but smoking on a persistent daily basis, an addictive pattern.  And 15 to 20 years later we saw

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we would ask to admit the entirety of the 1989 Surgeon General's Report.

THE COURT:  The entire report? MR. BASS:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Once again, I'm not sure � we'll take this up outside the presence of the jury.  Show what excerpts you want to show to the defense.

THE COURT:  That's okay.  Wait a minute. Ask him the question without the use of the exhibit, please.

Q.    Mr. Davis was asking you some questions about denicotinized cigarettes and I believe you said it's your opinion that they are safer; is that your opinion?

A.    Yeah.

Q.    And can you tell us why? A.    Because people won't use them on a repetitive basis.  So denicotinized cigarettes won't

24 maintain nicotine addiction and as a result people

won't repeatedly expose themselves to the chemicals

Q.    You were asked some questions about maybe your opinion today or your opinion from 2000 about the amount of nicotine in cigarettes.  Could you tell us what that was, what your opinion was in 2000 in that regard and whether it's different today?

A.    Sure.  I was, you know, well, one the � it's different today because of the access to some of the internal documents which I hadn't had an opportunity to see at the time that I did that deposition.  But in the context of that testimony was around light cigarettes and the concern that if you

13 merely lower the level of nicotine on a machine, as was

done with light cigarettes, people may end up smoking

15 more or changing how they smoke, taking bigger, deeper

puffs and it could actually be hazardous.  So that's why I said lower.

And you have to be careful about the amount of nicotine in a product because you could generate compensation that might actually not change the risk or actually increase risk.

And then I commented on the fact you could give people nicotine without tar and that's a good thing.  And I still believe that is true today, which is why I support the use of nicotine replacement

products, which are nicotine without tar, or even inhaling devices that only have nicotine and a few other chemicals rather than all the 7,000 chemicals you get in a cigarette.

Q.    Now, both myself and Mr. Belasic asked you about the Smart Move brochure you wrote in 1987, right?

A.    Right.

Q.    And I forget if it was in response to my questions as well, but to Mr. Belasic I think he asked you if that was true when you wrote it.  And you said it was true when you wrote it.  What did you mean by that?

A.    Well, certainly we know a lot more today.  I have created guides for smokers today, I tell them a lot of what I've learned about how cigarettes are engineered, things that we didn't know back in 1987.

17 And, again, it's important for smokers to have an

understanding not only � they know it's hard to quit, they don't know why.  And so I've incorporated a lot of that information that I provide.  That's what I was trying to communicate.

Q.    What was the purpose of putting that brochure together in 1987?

A.    It was a self-help guide to help give smokers tips on how to go about quitting smoking and to

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=1215
2423

1 motivate them to want to quit.

2     Q.    You're trying to help people quit smoking,

3 right?

4     A.    Sure.

5     Q.    And in so doing are you going to tell people

6 that if they put -- are you going to encourage people

7 and tell them that if they put their mind to it they

8 can do it, or are you going to tell them about the

9 realities of the ability to quit smoking?

10           MR. BELASIC:  Object, leading.

11           THE COURT:  It's multiple choice.

12       Overruled.

13           THE WITNESS:  I'm going to motivate them to

14       try to make a quit attempt.  And we did try to

15       give them some of the reality.  We talk about

16       the fact that many smokers relapse back to

17       smoking in the guide.  But that's why we said

18       everybody can make a quit attempt, but the

19       ability to sustain stay off is very different.

20       And the predictors of staying off are nicotine

21       dependence.  Motivation doesn't really predict

22       whether people stay off or not, it only predicts

23         whether they make a quit attempt. 2 4   BY MR. BASS:

25     Q.    Why not?  Why is motivation not always

United Reporting, Inc. 954-525-2221
pgNbr=1216
1

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11

12 mitigate some of that.  And that's what the medications

13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25

2424 enough?

A.    Motivation and willpower aren't enough because it's an addiction.  That's the reason.

Q.    Is wanting to quit always enough?

A.    No, it's not.

Q.    Why not?

A.    Because it's only the first step towards getting off cigarettes.  You gotta fight and overcome the physiological addiction.  And it helps for people to understand why they'll feel miserable when they quit smoking because they will experience withdrawal, how to

really do.  They don't make you quit smoking unless you put the patch over your mouth so you don't put a cigarette there.

So the � most people really don't know. They've been fooled into thinking that all they need to do is have willpower and that's just not true.

Q.    Does the ability to make an attempt mean you have the ability to be successful?

A.    No.

Q.    Explain the difference, please.

A.    Ability to make an attempt really relies primarily on what things might motivate you like information, you know, getting the fact that this is

2425 really harmful and it's harmful to you and personalizing that risk.  But the ability to sustain staying off has to do with how dependent somebody is on the drug and that's what our studies show.  The heaviness of smoking index is the single best predictor of ability to sustain staying off.  Those who are low dependence, they have higher odds of quitting and staying off than those who are at the other end of continuum.

Q.    Now, is the ability to stop for a day or two, does that mean you have the ability to stay quit for good?

A.    No.

Q.    Why not?

A.    Well, people who have quits of short duration, that's a predictor of dependence.  And it actually is a negative predictor of being able to sustain staying off.  People who have quit before and have been off a year or six months or something, they're more likely to be successful in future quit attempts than somebody who is in this cycle of addiction.  And it's pretty frustrating for people particularly if they're trying to quit, they end up relapsing back, cutting back on their cigarettes and there's a whole variety of things that people do.

2426 they struggle to quit.  And they often struggle until they hit rock bottom.

Q.    You were asked some questions about whether staying quit for 24 hours equals a serious or means it's a serious quit attempt, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    How do you define a quit attempt?

A.    I define it as when somebody tells me they're trying to quit and they're making the effort to stop, they put the cigarettes down, they say, I'm not going to smoke.  I don't define it as 24 hours or 48 hours.  Those are utilized as criteria so in surveys when you're going to count quit attempts you can do it. That's why they came up with those definitions primarily for evaluating therapeutic interventions like

16 medications to see whether quit attempts are resulting

in relapse or not.

Q.    Does the length of the quit attempt dictate to you whether or not the person wants to quit?

A.    No.

Q.    Why not?

A.    Because the length of the quit attempt relates more to the nicotine dependence not to the

24 motivation

Q.    And as you said, information about nicotine has been reported in the press throughout the years, right?

A.    Sure.

Q.    Certainly Mary Cooper knew cigarette smoking was hard to quit, right?

A.    Yeah, she figured that out when she tried to quit.

Q.    Do you have an opinion as to whether she knew why cigarette smoking was hard to quit?

MR. BELASIC:  Objection, calls for state of mind, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I don't know, Mr. Bass.  You need to rephrase that. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Based upon your education, training, experience, Dr. Cummings, with smokers trying to quit, prior to 2000, do you have an opinion as to whether or not smokers knew why smoking was hard to quit? MR. DAVIS:  Objection, Your Honor, speculation.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, I do have an opinion. BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And what is that opinion?

A.    Smokers don't know why it's hard to quit. They don't know the chemicals that are in the product, genetic engineering, those kinds of things, how the product has actually been engineered to keep them hooked.

Q.    And while there were references to nicotine certainly in the public press were there references to the things that you just talked about, nicotine

14 manipulation, chemicals, et cetera?

A.    No.

Q.    Now, you were asked some questions about, separate and apart from the FTC reports, about the FTC testing method for tar yield, right?

A.    Yes.

Q. And you were asked, I think Mr. Davis showed you the 1966 FTC statement concerning tar and nicotine yields, correct?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Did the FTC rescind the guidance it set forth in 1966?

	A.
	Yes.
	


	Q.
	When and why?
	


	A.
	They basically rescinded it in, I think,
	

2008 it
		was removed.
	


	Q.
	And do we have the press release, which is
	

PT
	5480,
	setting forth the basis for the recision?
	


	A.
	Yes.
 MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd
	


	offer PT 5480 into evidence.
		


	
	MR. DAVIS:  No objection.

	Q.
	And this is the press release, right,
	

Dr.
	Cummings?
		


	A.
	It is.
	


	Q.
	"FTC rescinds guidance from 1966 on
	

sta
	temen
	ts concerning tar and nicotine yields." Right?
	


	A.
	Correct.
	


	Q.
	And the portions we have highlighted say,
	

"In
	addi
	tion, the Commission believes the statements
	of

tar
	and
	nicotine yields as measured by this test method
	
are
	conf
	using at best and are likely to mislead

2430 consumers who believe they will get proportionately less tar and nicotine from lower-rated cigarettes than from higher-rated brands."

And then it ends with, "Our action today ensures that tobacco companies may not wrap their

6 [misleading tar and nicotine ratings in a cloak of

7 government sponsorship.  Simply put, the FTC will not be a smokescreen for tobacco companies' shameful

9   marketing practices."

10           Did I read that right?

11     A.    Yes.

12           THE COURT:  You have about 10 minutes,

16     Q.    Now, along the same lines of being asked the

18 you familiar with � let me ask you about PT 2009.

19           Are you familiar with a document from

20 February 19, 1969 I think it's from Dunn to Wakeham or

21 Wakeham to Dunn regarding Jet's money offer?

A.    Yes.

Q.    And what is that document? A.    Well, it's an internal document at Philip Morris and it's talking about, you know,

basically the knowledge of the health risks of smoking and their concern over a possible regulation of cigarettes.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd offer PT 2009 into evidence.

MR. DAVIS:  Objection, beyond the scope of the cross, Your Honor.

MR. BASS:  Judge, this is in response to FDA or involves the FDA and government, which was a topic of cross.

THE COURT:  Technically he's right, Mr. Bass, because they don't get a chance to address it.

Let me look.

I'll permit the document.  I'll permit you to recross on it since it wasn't in evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 2009 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    Okay.  We showed the top, Jet's money offer.

21 What was Jet's money offer?

A.    Well, it's Mr. Jet and he's talking about, I believe, I'm not sure what the money offer was for, but he's talking about the company's position on marketing cigarettes at this time.

Q.    And it says, "Who ain't for more money?" Right?

A.    Right.

Q.    He goes on to say, "I would be more cautious in using the pharmic-medical model.  Do we really want to tout cigarette smoke as a drug?  It is, of course, but there are dangerous FDA implications to having such conceptualization go beyond these walls." Did I read that right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    You were also asked about research funded by CTR, right?

A.    Yes.

Q. And you were taken through some things and some scientists that did CTR-funded research, right?

A.    That's right.

Q.    Are you also familiar with what would happen when research was done of a negative value to the industry?

A.    Yes.

Q. And are you familiar with a November 29th, 1977 document from Osdene to Seligman regarding some comments about the CTR program?

A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  Judge, they were asking about CTR-funded research �

MR. DAVIS:  I gotcha.  No objection.  I hear you.

THE COURT:  In evidence.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 1153 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    What's this document referring to, Dr. Cummings?

A.    They're referring to some CTR-funded research that was going on in the University of Rochester.  Leo Abood, who was a neuroscientist there.

17 And they had sent up one of their members Mr. Ford to

sort of check out the research.  And they're commenting on the implications of the research for the industry, because, in fact, the findings of identifying the nicotine effects in the brain, nicotine binding in the brain could potentially lead to antagonists, in other words, ways to block nicotine in the brain.  And that would have an adverse effect on their business.  So they cut out the research.

Q.    Are you familiar with the 1977 memorandum from Dunn to Osdene, subject: Proposed study by Levy? A.    Yes.

MR. BASS:  Your Honor, at this time we'd offer PT 2006 into evidence. MR. DAVIS:  Can I see it?

Your Honor, this is beyond the scope of any cross I did.  I didn't touch this area.

MR. BASS:  Judge, it's � goes to CTR. MR. DAVIS:  I didn't touch CTR, Your Honor. THE COURT:  Mr. Bass, the difficulty is admitting records on redirect.  They haven't had a chance to address them during cross.  That's the problem not the admissibility of the document.

MR. BASS:  It's my understanding that these are already in evidence because they were from � in the Banks case.

MR. DAVIS:  You mean other than being beyond the scope of my cross? THE COURT:  Yes. MR. DAVIS:  No.

THE COURT:  I will permit you, if you wish, to examine the document and recross the witness on it before we leave today.  Okay? MR. DAVIS:  Yes, sir.

(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT 2006 was received in evidence.) BY MR. BASS:

Q.    And this is Dunn to Osdene 1977, Proposed study by Levy.  And what was the proposed study by Levy if you know, Dr. Cummings?

A.    Sure.  She was doing a study to see what the effects of nicotine administration was on the appearance of withdrawal symptoms.  And the appearance of withdrawal symptoms would be an indication that there were a physiological effect of the drug.  In other words, indication of addiction.  And Dr. Levy at this time was in R&D doing animal � she was in charge of the animal studies at Philip Morris.

Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to wrap up in just a couple of minutes, just bear with us, okay.  Moving as best I can.

(Video clip was played and taken down to the best of the reporter's ability as follows:)

VOICE:  Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has issued two major reports on smoking.  One on the dangers of secondhand smoke, the other on nicotine addiction.

VOICE:  We have been told so frequently by

1       the cigarette industry that smoking is a matter

2       of free choice, you start when you want and you

3       quit when you want, but anybody who has ever

4       smoked knows that is not true.

5           VOICE:  What does the long-time record say

6       is the most dangerous age to get hooked on

7       tobacco?

8           VOICE:  Indications are very clear that the

9       people who are most heavily addicted to nicotine

10       and have the greatest trouble quitting are those

11       who began smoking when they were 14 to 16.  I

12       think the studies all over the world in every

13       country and every culture the younger you start,

14       the greater addiction and the more difficult it

15       is to quit.

16           VOICE:  Now you said that you consider

17       tobacco as addictive as cocaine or heroin.

18       Isn't that an overstatement?

19           VOICE:  No.  I think the evidence is very

20       clear if you understand what we're talking

21       about.  Addiction is a specific physiologic

22       problem.  And the manner in which you become

23       addicted to nicotine is exactly the same manner

24       in which you become addicted to cocaine or to

25       heroin.  And even after you have quit and you

(Video clip concluded.)

(Video clip was played and taken down to the best of the reporter's ability as follows:)

VOICE:  What do you say to the Tobacco Institute which said in a statement today that smoking is a personal choice which can be stopped if and when a person decides to do so?

THE WITNESS:  Well, ask the 43 million people who smoke in this country whether they can stop if they want to and you will find that 85 percent of them say, I would like to stop tomorrow, but I can't.  Many of them will say, I've tried 5 times to stop and I can't.  That is addiction.

VOICE:  Well, the Tobacco Institute in the same statement says by your own public health service figures 40 million Americans are former smokers and that 95 percent of them quit smoking without help.  And they say these figures and common sense contradicts any claim that smoking is an addiction.

2441

1           VOICE:  Absolutely not.  The tobacco

2       industry has always been very short on science.

3       As a matter of fact, people who are addicted to

4       morphine and heroin and cocaine know very well

5       that these are addictions, yet 30 percent of

6       those people give up that addiction on their

7       own.  So they are no different than tobacco

8       smokers.

9           VOICE:  Did I understand you to say 30

10       percent of those addicted to heroin and cocaine

11       give up on their own?

12           VOICE:  Give up on their own.  They are

13       spontaneous remitters.

14           VOICE:  But is there really a comparison in

15       intensity?  Because the first thing a layman

16       hears on hearing this comparison is:  But heroin

17       and cocaine are really serious drugs and you're

18       talking about cigarettes that millions of people

19       smoke and that aren't illegal.  Is there a

20       com � for instance, it's widely known, because

21       it occupies so much law enforcement, that

22       deprivation or withdraw from heroin or cocaine

23       leads people to kill or rob other people.  Now,

24       deprivation of cigarettes doesn't cause people

25       to do that.

1           VOICE:  I don't know that you know that,

3       cocaine and heroin as drugs that are elicit and,

4       therefore, they're not available.  And when

5       people go after them with this craving they will

6       do all sorts of things.

7           We have never had in this country a time

8       when tobacco wasn't available.  But if you go

9       back several centuries in the days when smokers

10       had their hands crushed or were beheaded, people

11       still went out and sought that drug.  We've

12       never had the experience in this country.

1           Dr. Cummings, you can step out.  Thank you

2       very much for coming to the courthouse.

3            (Witness excused.)

4           THE COURT:  When I discharge the jurors for

5       the weekend I always have to remind you of my

6       instructions over the weekend and continuing

7       instructions.  I know it's been a long week and

8       I've said it several times.  As we leave

9       tonight, please don't discuss the case with your

10       any of your loved ones or any family members,

11       please don't access the information on the

12       Internet to gain any information about the

13       topics or the people involved in the case and

14       don't engage in any discussions on blogs, chat

15       rooms or any other electronic media outlets to

16       discuss the case.

17           We appreciate your patience.  We are going

18       to now start moving the case forward a little

19       bit quicker.  I told you before it takes a

20       little while to get you all this information.

21       The case will start picking up next week with a

22       different topic.  So we will see you Monday

23         morning at 9 a.m.  Have a great weekend, 2 4                   everybody.

4       going to do?

5           MR. GDANSKI:  You know, I don't know
