1             So we like to keep things moving along, but

2       there are things that come up that are somewhat

3       unpredictable, and I have to resolve it. But

4       thank you for your patience. We're ready to

5       proceed.

6            Call your next witness.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Dr. Michael Cummings, Your

8       Honor.

9              KENNETH MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D.,

10   the Plaintiffs witness herein, being first duly sworn

11    on oath, was examined and deposed as follows:

12            THE COURT: Good morning, sir.

13            THE WITNESS: Good morning.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=3
14            THE COURT: Would you please state your full

15       name and spell your last name?

16            THE WITNESS: Kenneth Michael Cummings. And

17       that's spelled C-U-M-M-I-N-G-S.

18            THE COURT: Thank you. You may inquire.

19            MR. UITERWYK: May it please the Court?

20            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Counsel.

22                     DIRECT EXAMINATION

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   Good morning. I'm going to ask you again.

25   Could you introduce yourself to the jury, please? 2327

1        A.   Kenneth Michael Cummings.

2       Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, what do you do?

3       A.   I'm a professor at the Medical University of

4   South Carolina in the department of psychiatry and

5   behavorial sciences.

6       Q.   And how long have you been a professor at the

7   Medical University of -- can we call it MUSC?

8       A.   Sure.

9       Q.   How long?

10       A.   How long have I been there?

11        Q.   Yes.

12       A.   October of 2011, so I have been there about

13    18 months.

14       Q.   And tell the jury a little bit about what you

15   do in your position at MUSC, Medical University of

16   South Carolina?

17       A.   Sure. I was brought there basically to head

18   up their tobacco clinical and research program, so

19   tobacco addiction. I have an appointment in the

20   Hollings Cancer Center, which is a comprehensive cancer

21    center for the state of South Carolina. And, basically

22   I do research, I teach, and I am working to develop,

23   you know, clinical programs for the patients that are

24   seen at the Hollings, as well as the rest of the

25   hospital. We have about 27,000 patients we see in the 2328

1   hospital and then networking that across all the

2   hospitals in the state of South Carolina.

3       Q.   I called you Dr. Cummings, but you're not a

4   medical doctor; is that correct?

5       A.   Ph.D.

6       Q.   All right. And can you tell the jury what

7   kind of Ph.D. you are? What kind of --

8       A.   Sure. It's in public health, in health

9   education and health behavior. I have a master's in

10   public health as well. Both were from the University

11    of Michigan.

12       Q.   And we're going to go over that more a little

13   bit later, but do you actually teach medical doctors?

14       A.   Yes, I do.

15       Q.   What are some of the subject matters that you

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=4
16   teach to medical doctors?

17       A.   I do the lectures that -- essentially, on the

18   health effects of smoking, ways to assess the patients

19   that they will see in terms of their nicotine

20   dependence and then the treatments that are recommended

21    and approved for treating nicotine dependence, is

22   essentially what I do for the medical doctors.

23       Q.   Dr. Cummings, is it fair to say that you've

24   dedicated most of your professional career, your entire

25   professional career, on the issue of smoking and 2329

1   health?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   And before we go on with a lot more detail,

4   because we're going to go into detail about your

5   qualifications in a little bit, can you give the jury a

6   brief preview of what we're going to be covering today

7   with the jury?

8       A.   Sure. You know, a couple of main areas I'll

9   be talking about is smoking behavior and nicotine

10   addiction and how to assess it and how that relates to

11    Jacqueline Loyd in my assessment of whether she was

12   addicted to the nicotine in the cigarettes that she

13   smoked.

14            I'll be talking about information and how

15   people process information and how that influences

16   decisions people make, like starting to smoke and

17   quitting smoking. And that gets into issues around

18   marketing and the information environment that people

19   are exposed to at different time periods. It's very

20   different today than it used to be, you know, many

21    decades ago when people got started smoking in this

22   country.

23       Q.   Let me stop you there. There are a couple

24   follow-up questions on a couple of things you said.

25            You mentioned you're prepared to talk about 2330

1    addiction as it pertains to Mrs. Loyd. Do you have a

2   special expertise to assist the jury in understanding

3   how the defendants in this case, Lorillard and

4   Reynolds, contributed substantially to the addiction of

5   smokers like Jackie Loyd?

6       A.   Yes, I do.

7       Q.   All right. We'll talk about that in a

8   minute.

9            Do you have a special expertise to assist the

10   jury in determining whether the defendants chose to

11    make it easier to become addicted and made it more

12   difficult to overcome the addiction to nicotine in

13   cigarettes?

14       A.   I have expertise in that area. I've studied

15   that, and I have opinions about it, yes.

16       Q.   And are we going to be talking about that?

17       A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=5
18       Q.   Now, have you studied extensively the topic

19   of nicotine addiction and whether it has an enhanced

20   effect on youth?

21        A.   Sure, yes.

22       Q.   All right. And is that something we're going

23   to be talking about as well?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   Now, do you also -- you mentioned about the 2331

1   tobacco companies and so forth. Do you have a special

2   expertise which will assist the jury in determining

3   whether the defendants, Reynolds and Lorillard, knew

4   about the risk of cigarettes posed to human health,

5   including lung cancer and COPD, and compare -- and

6   compare that to what they told the American public?

7       A.   Yes. I've studied the internal business

8   records of the tobacco companies, including Reynolds

9   and Lorillard, to see what they knew about the health

10   effects, when they knew those things, and then what

11    they told the American public about that. I've written

12   articles on it and had grants and helped process many

13   of the internal business records to make them publicly

14   available that was part of the research that I'm

15   involved with.

16       Q.   And we're going to talk about that in a

17   little bit more detail in a minute as well.

18            What do you refer to that as?

19       A.   I refer to it as the 50-year coverup.

20       Q.   All right. Now, do you have a special

21    expertise to discuss with the jury whether the

22   defendants knew about the power and effect of nicotine

23   and whether they communicated that to the American

24   public or their consumers?

25       A.   Yes. I've studied, again, the internal 2332

1   business records of the company as somebody who is an

2   expert in smoking behavior and the difficulty people

3   have in stopping smoking, the effects of how products

4   are designed and engineered in ways that affect human

5   smoking behavior and what the companies were saying

6   about that internally, as well as what they were

7   telling the American public about issues related to

8   nicotine addiction.

9       Q.   All right. And are you going to be

10   talking -- strike that.

11             Have you studied --1 know you are going to

12   be talking to the jury as well, about the way that the

13   defendants, Lorillard and Reynolds, chose to engineer,

14   design, and manipulate their cigarettes that they sell

15   to the public for consumption.

16            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

17       Argumentative. And I have another objection I

18       would like to approach on.

19            THE COURT: Okay. You may approach.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=6
20            (At the bench)

21             THE COURT: Your objection on argumentative

22       is overruled.

23            Your next one is?

24            MR. WALKER: There is an open issue about

25       whether this witness will be allowed to talk about 2333

1        cigarette design issues. If he wants to ask

2       questions related to his qualifications, that's

3       fine. But he's introducing a topic that this

4       witness is not qualified to discuss, in our view.

5            THE COURT: Okay.

6            MR. WALKER: I think the question has to be

7       worded different.

8            MR. UITERWYK: I have -- sorry.

9            THE COURT: Yes.

10            MR. UITERWYK: I haven't asked -- I'm not

11        going to ask him any opinions about it until he

12       does talk about his background. All I've asked

13       him is, Are you going to be talking with the jury

14       about design and manipulation and engineering of

15       the cigarettes? And I have not asked him any

16       opinions about it yet.

17            MR. WALKER: And he may not be talking about

18       any of those things, is my point.

19            THE COURT: If he doesn't, then I don't --

20       it's sort of like an opening statement. It's --

21        these are the things I hope to bring to your

22       attention, but sometimes you fail in that because

23       either you don't do it or the judge rules it out,

24       so --

25            MR. PEDROSA: Judge, the opinions are 2334

1        embedded in the question. If the question had

2       just been, Are you going to talk about this, We

3       wouldn't be up here with an objection. But are

4       you going to talk about how they designed

5       cigarettes to do X, Y, or Z, he is embedding the

6       question before we have any qualifications.

7            THE COURT: Yeah, I will sustain that part of

8       the objection. In other words, don't -- to the

9       extent -- and maybe I ruled too quickly on

10       Mr. Walker's objection. You can ask him -- do you

11        intend to talk about the design of cigarettes?

12       And just leave it at that.

13            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

14            THE COURT: And that way it doesn't color the

15       question. Okay?

16            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.

17            (In open court)

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   Are you going to be talking about the design

20   of cigarettes as done by these particular defendants

21    and other cigarette companies?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=7
22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   And in addition, are you going to be talking

24   about the history of the tobacco industry's advertising

25   and marketing in this company and what that has to do 2335

1   with Jackie Loyd?

2       A.   I will, yes.

3       Q.   And do you also have a special expertise to

4   discuss with the jury how the public perceived and

5   perceives the message, the health messages that they

6   got from the cigarette companies?

7       A.   I do have special expertise in that area.

8   I've studied, you know, what people know and believe

9   about the health risks of smoking, how that influences

10   their behavior. It's an important area of the research

11    that I have been involved with for over 30 years.

12       Q.   And are you also prepared to -- you talked

13   about addiction. But of that addiction, are you

14   prepared to talk about how the addiction to nicotine in

15   cigarettes played a part in the development of

16   smoking-related diseases?

17            THE WITNESS: Yes.

18            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

19       Argumentative.

20            THE COURT: Sustained.

21    BY MR. UITERWYK:

22       Q.   Are you going to be talking about nicotine

23   and smoking-related illnesses and the connection?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   Now, are you specifically going to be talking 2336

1    about whether Jackie Loyd was addicted to cigarettes

2   containing nicotine?

3       A.   I was asked to make an assessment, and I have

4   made that assessment, and I'm prepared to give my

5   opinion as to whether she was addicted.

6       Q.   And in that case, in doing that, have you

7   reviewed the medical records in this case as well?

8       A.   I reviewed medical records, depositions,

9   worksheets that were prepared. That was the material

10   that I have looked at.

11        Q.   All right. And the jury has heard the term

12   depositions so far a little bit in this thing. Have

13   you reviewed depositions that were done in this case?

14       A.   I have.

15       Q.   Have you reviewed the depositions of all the

16   family members that have been deposed?

17       A.   I don't know about all. I mean, I have

18   reviewed many depositions, you know. Probably I'm

19   thinking of about a dozen or so.

20       Q.   About a dozen depositions?

21        A.   Yes. Over a dozen, I believe.

22       Q.   So you haven't just reviewed two depositions,

23   have you?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=8
24       A.   No, no. I reviewed two --1 was deposed in

25   this case myself back in 2009. And I reviewed 2337

1    depositions that were provided to me along with medical

2   records and these worksheets. I think there were two

3   at that time. And since that time, I've reviewed

4   additional depositions that were taken in the case.

5   And that's what I am referring to when I say over a

6   dozen.

7       Q.   All right. And we'll go over those in a

8   little bit.

9            Now that we have covered the topics that you

10   are going to be talking about, I want to go back to

11    your background and qualifications if we could, please.

12            MR. UITERWYK: And let's look at tab 1.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   Now, Dr. Cummings, we've got both up here,

15   your previous and current positions. And if you could,

16   your current positions are actually on the left, are

17   they not?

18       A.   Well, the top two are my current positions.

19   The one on the left -- the bottom on the left, the

20   chairman of the department of health behavior and a

21    senior scientist at Roswell, I held that position for

22   about 30 years --

23       Q.   All right.

24       A.   -- before I went to the Medical University of

25   South Carolina. 2338

1        Q.   And before we talk about that, can you give

2   the jury a little bit of your educational background

3   before you got to those previous and current positions

4   and led you to those positions --

5       A.   Sure.

6       Q.    starting with college?

7       A.   Okay. In 1971,1 went off to college,

8   started actually at Florida Southern here in Lakeland

9   and did a semester there and then transferred. I met

10   my wife in high school, so I moved to a college near

11    her, which happened to be in Miami. She went to

12   Western, and I went to Miami-Ohio, and I finished up my

13   degree at Miami University Ohio in Oxford, Ohio,

14   basically doing health education. I was going to be a

15   health teacher.

16            And then I went and did an internship my

17   senior year at the New Jersey --1 grew up in New

18   Jersey. The state health department was encouraged to

19   do a graduate program in public health. I was

20   fortunate, you know. I was able to get a scholarship

21    to go to the University of Michigan School of Public

22   Health. I did my M.P.H. there for two years, got a

23   scholarship from the University of Michigan to continue

24   on and do a research degree, a Ph.D., in health

25   education and health behavior in the school of public

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=9
2339

1   health, which I completed in, basically, at the end of

2    1980. And then I worked for two years at Wayne State

3   University and went to Roswell Park where I spent over

4   30 years.

5            MR. UITERWYK: All right. And let's go back

6       to the slide 2, if we could, please.

7   BY MR. UITERWYK:

8       Q.   Does that outline your education there?

9       A.   That does it.

10       Q.   And then following that education, you have

11   been 33 years in public health, 31 years in cancer

12   prevention, 31 years in tobacco studies and treatment,

13   and 12-plus years as the custodian of secret tobacco

14   records.

15       A.   Yeah. It's a little longer than that,

16   actually. The records -- many of them were turned over

17   to the State of New York, and then they were turned

18   over to me actually at Roswell and organized an effort,

19   which is still ongoing, but it's almost 15 years now of

20   digitizing, scanning, analyzing the internal business

21    records of the companies.

22            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Go back again if

23       we could, Barron, to the next slide.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   Now, you've talked a little bit about what 2340

1   you do at the Medical University of South Carolina.

2   But before we get to that, can we first talk about

3   where you were before you went to University of South

4   Carolina?

5       A.   Sure. Roswell Park Cancer Institute in

6   Buffalo, New York.

7       Q.   And how long were you at Roswell Park?

8       A.   A little over 30 years.

9       Q.   And what was your focus when you were at

10   Roswell Park Cancer Institute? Strike that.

11            What was your focus at Roswell Park Cancer

12   Institute on the issues of smoking and health?

13       A.   It became my focus.

14       Q.   Would you elaborate please?

15       A.   Sure. I started therein 1981. And, you

16   know, I was in the department of cancer prevention and

17   cancer control. Roswell Park is the oldest

18   comprehensive cancer center in the United States. It

19   is over 100 years old. It is a dedicated hospital and

20   research program just for cancer. And it's a large

21    institution, about 2,500 employees. And they have a

22   unit that's well-known in the area of cancer prevention

23   and control. I joined that unit in 1981. And within

24   about a year or so, I began to focus my research on

25   helping people quit smoking and created the clinical 2341

1   research programs, in other words, how to help people

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=10
2   quit, running clinics. And in the time that I

3   developed that program and ran it personally, I've seen

4   probably over 10,000 smokers.

5       Q.   Which program was that?

6       A.   That was the stop smoking clinic that I ran

7   at Roswell. So that was actually personal programs.

8   These were largely run as groups. We run them at the

9   hospital, continuing medical education, at work places,

10   in prisons, in drug rehab centers all across the region

11    of western New York. In 2000,1 created the New York

12   State Smokers Quit Line, which is the telephone

13   quitting service that the State of New York created --

14   or funded. I created it for them. I operated that for

15    11 years. It's the largest quit line in the world.

16       Q.   How did that come about?

17       A.   Well, in a conversation that I had with

18   somebody in the health department, they said, We've got

19   to find a way to help more people quit smoking.

20            And I said, Why don't we make it easy so they

21   just call an 800 number?

22            And I created the quit line. And I had done

23   some earlier work on a program called the Cancer

24   Information Service that was funded by the National

25   Cancer Institute around the country for people to call 2342

1    on issues related to cancer. And many people would

2   call about smoking. So we trained and developed that

3   system, but it wasn't exclusively for smoking. I set

4   up the one on tobacco for New York State, and that's

5   been replicated. Every state now has a tobacco quit

6   line.

7       Q.   Now, you've got -- you were director of the

8   Tobacco Cessation Center at the Roswell Park Cancer

9   Institute. And you are the director of the New York

10   State Smokers hot line -- quit line?

11        A.   Quit line.

12       Q.   Were they part of the same thing or were they

13   different?

14       A.   They were part of the same thing. The

15   clinical program, you know, still functions today. We

16   did many clinical trials, in other words, experiments

17   to evaluate different ways to help people quit smoking.

18   When the gum and the patch first came out, we had

19   programs to test those. We've done studies on vaccines

20   to help people quit smoking, other kinds of both

21   behavorial and pharmacologic treatments that were done

22   as part of that.

23            And I'm continuing that at the Medical

24   University of South Carolina. That's one of the

25   things -- that is more on the research end. But the 2343

1    clinic and the quit line, those are services. So I had

2   a research program and a clinical program that I ran,

3   plus an education program. I taught graduate classes

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=11
4   for, you know, 25 years in epidemiology, in the area of

5   public health aspects of tobacco control.

6       Q.   Let me stop you. In connection with this

7   quit line and the cessation center, how much

8   involvement did you have as it relates to analyzing

9   whether people were addicted to cigarettes containing

10   nicotine?

11        A.   Well, I developed direct, because I ran the

12   clinics. So you're dealing with people and you're

13   doing an assessment. The reason for doing an

14   assessment is you want to tailor the treatment. Some

15   people find it easy to quit. Many people find it hard

16   to quit. Some people find it extremely hard. And you

17   want to tailor your treatments accordingly for people.

18            And so I developed a lot of the early tools

19   for assessing nicotine dependence in smoking. I have

20   validated those tools in various studies that I've been

21    involved with and continue to be involved with. And so

22   it's -- the research is always trying to feed back into

23   the clinical program, because we would like to

24   translate the science so it has some benefit for

25   people. 2344

1        Q.   Let me just ask you now, Is nicotine

2   addictive?

3       A.   Yeah. No doubt.

4       Q.   Is there any dispute about that within the

5   scientific community?

6       A.   None.

7       Q.   Now, you have on here, on the left side,

8   bottom left, you have chairman -- chairman and cancer

9   research scientist 7, department of health behavior,

10   division of cancer prevention, population services,

11    Roswell Park Cancer Institute.

12            How big was your business card? I mean,

13   that's a mouthful. What is that?

14       A.   Well, basically, I was just a department

15   chair, and I also was involved in --1 ran the division

16   of cancer prevention and control within the cancer

17   center. So if you're going to be a comprehensive

18   center, which is a designation you get from the

19   National Cancer Institute -- and there are only about

20   60 of those centers around the country -- you have to

21    have an excellent cancer population, cancer research

22   program.

23            And so I ran that program for a while. I

24   also ran a department and had -- because of the -- we

25   had a survey unit that we did, because we do lots of 2345

1    studies on what people know about various aspects of

2   cancer and tobacco being a big part of that.

3            I ran the tobacco lab as part of my research

4   activities, the quit line, the clinical services. I

5   had about 160 people working for me at Roswell. It was

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=12
6   a big operation. It continues to be a good program.

7   And I left it in good hands. And I moved to South

8   Carolina because all my kids live in Charleston, South

9   Carolina. I've got two grandkids, and they offered me

10   a job there. And I said, The stars are never aligned,

11    so that's why I'm in South Carolina.

12       Q.   So was it your mission as being part of the

13   Roswell Park Cancer Institute based on your knowledge

14   and experience that you had and your training to help

15   the people who were addicted to the cigarettes

16   containing nicotine and helping them to overcome their

17   addiction?

18       A.   It became my mission, because when I came to

19   Roswell in their cancer prevention program and you just

20   sort of look at what's going on, about a third of the

21    cancer deaths that we see are due to smoking. So if

22   you're involved in the department of cancer prevention

23   and control, you've got to focus on, you know, tobacco

24   and tobacco addiction.

25            And so it became the work that I did. It's 2346

1   where the research grants I wrote eventually focused

2   and continues to be a focus because that issue hasn't

3   really changed. I mean, smoking -- cancer deaths from

4   smoking are going down finally because smoking rates

5   are going down. But it's still the No. 1 preventable

6   cause of disease and death in the United States today,

7   is smoking.

8       Q.   Now, based on your experience, what is the

9   reason why people continue to expose their lungs and

10   other parts of their body to smoking?

11             THE WITNESS: Well, nobody is choosing --

12            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Lack of

13       foundation. Calls for speculation.

14            THE COURT: Overruled.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   What are the reasons?

17       A.   People are addicted -- the people that get

18   sick from smoking are the ones that are addicted to

19   cigarettes. Nobody chooses to get cancer or COPD or

20   heart disease from smoking, you know. If they continue

21    to smoke and repeatedly expose themselves for one

22   reason, and that's because they got hooked on the

23   cigarettes and because of nicotine in those cigarettes

24   and the way they are engineered.

25       Q.   And those that are more addicted to nicotine, 2347

1    do they struggle more to quit?

2       A.   Yes, absolutely. And there's individual

3   variation. As I said, some people find it easy. Some

4   people don't smoke every day, probably not that

5   addicted. But some people are heavily addicted, so

6   there is biology that interacts with the product.

7       Q.   And we'll talk about that a little bit more

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=13
8   later. But you mentioned addiction affects -- excuse

9   me -- affects different people in different ways.

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   Smoking affects different people in different

12   ways?

13       A.   It does.

14       Q.   Are there some smokers who smoke very little?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   What are they called?

17       A.   Well, we have the term "social smoker."

18    "Chipper" is the term that I use, which are

19   intermittent smokers. These are the nondaily smokers.

20   And there are five to ten percent of people who are

21    nondaily smokers. They seem to be able to smoke, put

22   it down, and not go back to it. They tend, when they

23   stop smoking and try to stay off permanently, are able

24   to do so more readily than people who, say, smoke you

25   know, persistently over many years, you know, a pack or 2348

1   more per day.

2       Q.   And you mentioned the term "chipper." What

3   is the definition of a "chipper"?

4       A.   I define it --1 define it by daily use. So

5   it's nondaily use. A chipper would be somebody who

6   they're smoking on a nondaily basis. They tend to fit

7   the definition of a social smoker, because they often

8   are doing it in social circumstances. They'll go out

9   with friends and have a cigarette or two, but they

10   don't seem to have the same pattern of addictive

11   behavior, this compulsive use behavior, which we see

12   with the majority of smokers. About 85 to 90 percent

13   of smokers are persistent daily users.

14       Q.   And when you say they are "persistent daily

15   users," you mean 85 to 90 percent of the smokers are

16   addicted?

17       A.   Yes.

18            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Leading.

19            THE COURT: Sustained.

20   BY MR. UITERWYK:

21        Q.   How would you describe the 85 to 90 percent

22   of the other smokers who are not the chippers?

23       A.   I believe they have -- they are addicted to

24   nicotine, and then their strength of addiction is

25   determined by how much they smoke and the pattern of 2349

1   their smoking. And there are criteria that I've

2   developed and others have adopted that are used to

3   describe that pattern, which is what I utilize in

4   developing treatment programs for smokers to help

5   tailor the interventions, accordingly.

6       Q.   It shows up there that you were professor --

7   or are you still a professor at the Department of

8   Cancer of Pathology and Prevention at the Roswell Park

9   division of the State University New York Buffalo?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=14
10       A.   Yeah. That's another mouthful. But Roswell

11    had its own academic division. It was a part of the

12   State University of New York at Buffalo. So many of

13   the doctors at Roswell Park have academic appointments

14   at the state university and teach and mentor students,

15   both medical students, as well as graduate students,

16   Ph.D.s, master's students. So we had our own program,

17   so I was a professor in that program, as well as in the

18   department of social and preventive medicine.

19       Q.   Now, did you teach courses in cancer

20   epidemiology?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   What is cancer epidemiology? We've heard the

23   term "epidemiology," but what's "cancer epidemiology"?

24       A.   Oh, it's merely the focus of the study of the

25   patterns of cancer in human populations over time, 2350

1   person and place. So it's looking at the causes,

2   trying to understand the causes, and how the trends

3   reflect those causes over time. So, for example,

4   smoking and the rise in lung cancer is an area of focus

5   of cancer epidemiology, for example.

6       Q.   And who did you teach that -- those courses

7   to regarding cancer and epidemiology and smoking?

8       A.   I taught them to master's students, Ph.D.s,

9   post docs and M.D.s. So, you know, it's basically a

10   graduate program. We had a master's, Ph.D. program,

11    and then some of the M.D.s, as well as dental students

12   and pharmacy students would come into the program as

13   well and take those courses.

14       Q.   And did you teach courses in health behavior?

15       A.   I did.

16       Q.   And courses in tobacco control?

17       A.   Those are two separate courses. I taught a

18   basic core course in theories of health behavior, which

19   is applying various psychological and social

20   psychological theories to try and understand why people

21   behave the way they do with regards to their health, so

22   preventive type behaviors like, you know, staying out

23   of the sun or using tobacco, and then as medication

24   compliance behaviors and how people respond to

25   symptoms. And there are all kinds of different 2351

1   theories that have been proposed, and they get

2   translated into interventions that we hopefully apply

3   that affect and improve people's health.

4       Q.   Going back to the epidemiology, what

5   expertise do you have in epidemiology?

6       A.   Well, the -- you know, epidemiology is the

7   study of, you know, disease patterns in human

8   populations. My experience in epidemiology is based on

9   my research that I have done, the epidemiology of

10   tobacco and disease. And, you know, I did take

11    graduate level courses in epidemiology during my

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=15
12   training at the University of Michigan, and then I

13   taught it to graduate students for 25 years. And so

14   epidemiology is -- for people in the health field, you

15   know, a biologist might be focused on the cell. The

16   doctor focuses on the individual patient. An

17   epidemiologist focuses on populations. And so I do

18   population health. And because behaviors like tobacco

19   use are so important to influencing trends in

20   population health, that's why I think I was asked to

21    teach those courses.

22       Q.   All right. We're still on the screen over

23   here. And the last item we haven't discussed is you're

24   professor of the department of social and preventive

25   medicine, School of Public Health and Health 2352

1   Preventions -- or Professions, rather, at the State

2   University of New York.

3            What does that entail?

4       A.   Well, you know, I taught courses there. I

5   mentored students who went through that program. So

6   they had master students; they had Ph.D. students; they

7   had medical doctors and other health professionals who

8   were getting professional degrees focused on areas of

9   prevention and health. And I still have appointments

10   at both of those places because I still mentor students

11   back in my home institution, so -- I'm continuing to do

12   that, so I maintain those academic appointments.

13       Q.   All right. Let me move off of that for a

14   moment and let's go back to what you were talking

15   about, which was about the industry's -- the cigarette

16   industry internal documents that you've briefly

17   mentioned when we were talking about what you were

18   going to be talking about.

19            In connection with those internal documents,

20   have you taken a special interest in studying,

21    researching, and becoming involved with regard to those

22   internal documents and the records of the cigarette

23   companies, including the defendants and other related

24   entities, industry-related entities in that regard?

25       A.   Yes, I have. 2353

1        Q.   Why have you taken that kind of interest in

2   those documents?

3       A.   Well, "why" is very simple. I'm a scientist.

4   It's another source of information, information that we

5   previously didn't have that helps inform the things --

6   the research that we do. So while you can collect your

7   own data and make observations and test hypotheses, it

8   always is helpful to have other sources of data to

9   validate hypotheses, to give you new ideas that you

10   haven't thought about previously.

11             And so in the internal business records of

12   companies, I began to see some of these internal

13   records. In the late 1990s, I became a big proponent

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=16
14   of utilizing that as yet another source of data. And a

15   good share of those materials ended up in my lap

16   because of where I was and the work that I had done and

17   the reputation that I had built at Roswell. The State

18   Attorney General in New York, where a good share of the

19   documents were turned over to, came to me and asked me

20   to take those materials. In fact, Roswell wanted to be

21    the repository of the materials. And I said, yes, we

22   would. And I didn't realize what I was getting myself

23   into, but 16 million pages of documents later, filling

24   up a room probably five times the size of this room --

25       Q.   I think we actually have a photograph, Slide 2354

1    14.

2            MR. UITERWYK: Do we not?

3   BY MR. UITERWYK:

4       Q.   While we're getting to that photo, can you --

5   how were you able to do this? Who funded this? How

6   did you get this project? Is that some of the pictures

7   of some of the areas where all these documents are

8   stored?

9       A.   Yeah. I had an opportunity --

10       Q.   The photograph, rather?

11        A.   Yes, yes. I had an opportunity during this

12   period in the late 1990s to talk with people who had

13   previously worked for tobacco manufacturers who

14   informed me about some of the internal business records

15   and what they might reveal. I had seen some of the

16   early records. And then I agreed to take the records.

17   And this is a picture. And you can see the upper left

18   is the documents. They would bring them in, every two

19   weeks we would get a shipment of these big legal boxes

20   with all the documents. They were organized. They've

21    a numbering system.

22            So you asked who funded this. And, you know,

23   how -- it seemed to be a remarkable, you know, treasure

24   trove of documents.

25            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. 2355

1        Relevance as to funding.

2            THE COURT: Sustained.

3   BY MR. UITERWYK:

4       Q.   Did you get a grant?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   From whom?

7       A.   The National --

8            MR. WALKER: Same objection, Your Honor.

9            THE COURT: Overruled.

10   BY MR. UITERWYK:

11        Q.   Go ahead.

12       A.   The National Institutes of Health. Several

13   grants actually.

14       Q.   In connection with reviewing these documents?

15       A.   Reviewing and later to process them so other

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=17
16   scientists could see them as well.

17       Q.   You mentioned these documents, and you

18   mentioned, I think, the number of 16 million documents.

19   You haven't, obviously, reviewed all 16 million.

20       A.   No, I haven't, obviously.

21        Q.   And you have staff that's helping you with

22   this project?

23       A.   I hired at the height of our work -- we've

24   digitized almost all the material. We had about 20

25   people. I hired experts in digital science. I hired 2356

1    computer experts and librarians. And they developed an

2   indexing system, and the computer folks developed some

3   of the early optical scan recognition software which

4   allowed us to search for key words and information in

5   these materials so you could go in --

6            Like you go into a library, you can't read

7   all the pages in a library, but you can go in and find

8   things that you are looking for on certain topics

9   through a card catalog.

10       Q.   Now --

11        A.   That's what we developed.

12       Q.   These documents, when you refer to these

13   industry documents, were these something that was out

14   in the public domain?

15       A.   No.

16       Q.   And what time frame did these documents cover

17   that were in the public domain?

18       A.   These documents go back into the, you know,

19   basically, back into the twenties, thirties. The vast

20   share of the materials were from the fifties up

21    through, you know, the nineteen -- the late 1990s.

22       Q.   And when did these documents come to you, and

23   when were you-all first able to look at these documents

24   and look at what was in these records from the

25   cigarette companies? 2357

1        A.   The processing that's displayed there started

2   in earnest in late 1999 and continued really through

3   about 2006. We're still -- they are still missing

4   materials. We kept track of every record through a

5   numbering system. We are still trying to get some of

6   the materials that were removed.

7       Q.   All right. Now, in addition to the

8   documents, were you also provided any audio or video

9   records in connection with the cigarette industry that

10   have not been out -- or that have been stored and were

11    disclosed to you-all for the first time during that

12   time frame?

13       A.   Yes. There were audio and videotapes as

14   well, typically of spokespeople for the companies and

15   statements that they had made, and kept track of all of

16   this information. And it was relevant because this was

17   a record and archive of what the companies, in fact,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=18
18   through their representatives, The Tobacco Institute,

19   were telling the American public about issues related

20   to smoking and health at different time points.

21        Q.   All right. It's probably obvious, but were

22   these documents voluntarily turned over to you by the

23   cigarette companies?

24            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor,

25       relevance, 403. 2358

1            THE COURT: Approach, please.

2            (At the bench.)

3            THE COURT: What's the relevancy?

4            MR. UITERWYK: We are talking about

5       concealment.

6            THE COURT: Okay.

7            MR. UITERWYK: In this case we're talking

8       about the issue of when the records were exposed

9       and when they -- when the public knew about them

10       and when they didn't know about them and this type

11        of thing. I think it's very relevant.

12            MR. WALKER: He's already testified about the

13       when. What he is trying to elicit from this

14       witness is testimony about other unrelated

15       litigation, unrelated to this case, unrelated to

16       Engle. And that's what he wants them to talk

17       about, is litigation against the companies that

18       led to the turning over of those documents.

19            MR. UITERWYK: All I'm asking him is were

20       those documents voluntarily disclosed.

21             MR. PEDROSA: He's already asked if the

22       documents were publicly available. That's what's

23       relevant to the concealment claim. Whether the

24       ultimate disclosure was voluntary or not doesn't

25       add anything to that. It's just a date. 2359

1            THE COURT: The objections are overruled.

2            Mr. Uiterwyk, I'd like to break for lunch

3       around 12:30. So when you get to that point, when

4       you get to a convenient point around that time,

5       then let me know. Okay?

6            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Thank you, Your Honor.

7            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, just one thing. If

8       he goes beyond the yes or no where they

9       voluntarily, and does get into other litigation, I

10       understand that your ruling is without prejudice

11        to me objecting to that. Is that right?

12            THE COURT: If he has another question on

13       that, you are free to object.

14            MR. WALKER: Okay. Thank you, Judge.

15            (In open court.)

16   BY MR. UITERWYK:

17       Q.   Were these documents, the question was,

18   voluntarily turned over by the cigarette companies?

19       A.   Well, I wouldn't say voluntarily. They were

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=19
20   in agreement with the State Attorney Generals,

21    including the State Attorney General in New York. I

22   got the documents from the State Attorney General of

23   New York at the time.

24       Q.   And approximately what year was this? Or

25   what time frame did you get these documents? 2360

1        A.   Late '99 was when the material there started

2   to come to Roswell Park. And that continued for, you

3   know, a number of years, about 2006.

4       Q.   And what were these documents and films and

5   videos? In general, what are they about?

6       A.   The collections that came to Roswell Park in

7   physical form, where we had to scan them and so on,

8   were from two organizations: The Tobacco Industry

9   Research Committee, later known as the Council For

10   Tobacco Research, and then the other of the -- actually

11    the largest share of the materials came from the

12   Tobacco Institute, which was a trade association

13   financed by Reynolds, Lorillard and the other tobacco

14   manufacturers. So it was actually their files that

15   they had. In addition, there were electronic records

16   that came to us that we also prepared and put up on the

17   website and shared these with the University of

18   California San Francisco. They have a digital archive

19   of all the tobacco documents and have a total of about

20   60 million pages.

21        Q.   And do you have any ballpark figure as to 

22            Well, before I talk about -- we talk about

23   the documents, what about the films? What are they

24   generally about? The videos, audios.

25       A.   The films that came from the Tobacco 2361

1   Institute archives were primarily -- they were public

2   statements as well as examples of some produced

3   materials, commercials, films that they have produced

4   over time to give to the public on their --on their

5   clients' behalf with regards to issues related to

6   smoking and health.

7            In addition, there were collections of ads,

8   marketing ads. I have a collection of about 10,000

9   print ads and over 600 television commercials.

10   Cigarette advertising was very common on television in

11    the fifties and sixties, and so I have a collection of

12   about 600. I'm not sure if it's all ads, but it's a

13   pretty large share of the advertising that appeared on

14   television.

15       Q.   Do you have any idea how much you time you

16   spent doing this, hours, days, months, years, however

17   you want to define it?

18       A.   I've spent 15 years basically doing this.

19   I'm still doing research on documents. Of course, many

20   people have done studies, now that we've made the

21    material available publicly. Books have been written,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=20
22   based on the materials that we've uncovered, on a whole

23   variety of topics from product engineering to subjects

24   related to nicotine addiction, to smoking and health,

25   what was known, what was said, you know. And this is 2362

1    continuing to be a part of the scholarly research

2   that's going on. And there are agreements, now that

3   the repository documents are continuing, although not

4   flowing through me, fortunately, at this point. I'm

5   more just a consumer of the materials that are out

6   there.

7       Q.   Now, one of the things that you are going to

8   be testifying with this jury is about what these

9   documents contained and what you all found in these

10   large groups and what others have found in these large

11    groups of documents. And that -- are you going to be

12   discussing that with the jury?

13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   All right. Now, do they also -- do some of

15   these documents also address the issue of what the

16   tobacco cigarette companies were saying between

17   themselves or within the organization that they

18   created, secretly saying among themselves as to whether

19   or not nicotine in cigarettes was addictive?

20            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor,

21        argumentative.

22            THE COURT: Overruled.

23            THE WITNESS: Yes.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   And do they address -- also, a lot of these 2363

1    documents, do they address and have you studied and

2   researched and written on the -- some of these

3   documents, that they address the designing, engineering

4   and manipulation of the cigarettes during manufacturing

5   to cause and sustain addiction of their customers?

6       A.   I have studied that topic, and I've written

7   on that topic both in peer reviewed publications as

8   well as in Surgeon General's reports.

9       Q.   Now, and do those documents, some of these

10   documents, a number of these documents also address the

11    issue of what the cigarette companies knew about the

12   health effects of their products and what problems and

13   diseases their products could cause compared to what

14   they were telling the public during a 50-year period?

15            MR. WALKER: Objection, leading.

16            THE COURT: Overruled.

17            THE WITNESS: Yes.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   All right. And are you prepared -- you are

20   going to be discussing that with the jury during the

21    next day or so?

22       A.   Yes. I specifically have done research on

23   what the companies studied about the health effects and

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=21
24   what they said internally about the health effects of

25   smoking, when they were saying that, versus what they 2364

1   were saying to the American public.

2       Q.   All right. Now, and do these documents

3   address how the cigarette companies during that time

4   frame targeted the youth of this country, like

5   including Jackie Loyd?

6            MR. WALKER: Objection, argumentative.

7            THE COURT: Overruled.

8            THE WITNESS: Yes.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Do they also address why their customers

11    smoked and do they study that?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   And did they act on what they found out in

14   connection with their design, engineering and

15   manipulation of their products?

16       A.   Yes. They acted on it. It was part of their

17   marketing. Marketing included product engineering,

18   advertising, pricing, policies and placements, the four

19   P's of marketing. And that's clearly represented in

20   the studies that were included within the materials

21    that I reviewed and written on from the internal

22   records of the companies.

23       Q.   And we'll talk a little bit more of what you

24   have written on in the field of design and engineering

25   of cigarettes. In addition to that, did you all have 2365

1    or do you have and still have or did they have a

2   product testing lab? And let's look at slide 12 and

3    13, product testing lab at Roswell Park.

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   All right. Now we've got here, and it

6   appears like the left-hand side, there's a freezer

7   there. And it also talks about a freezer. That's why

8   I see that it is a freezer. Did you all have a freezer

9   there?

10       A.   Yeah, the lab includes a freezer. We have

11   been collecting, as part of my research that I have

12   funded from the National Institutes of Health, created

13   a tobacco lab. We collect up cigarettes to look at how

14   they have changed over time.

15            The reason they are frozen is that if you

16   just leave the cigarettes out on the shelf, they get

17   stale, and the chemistries and how they perform and are

18   smoked differ. So you have to actually store them in a

19   specific way. And there's a protocol for doing that.

20   And then you recondition them so that they are fresh

21    like they were when you go about testing them.

22            We do all kinds of study on human smoking

23   behavior, how people puff on them using computers, how

24   that affects people in terms of heart rate, the

25   exposures that they get measured in a, you know, a

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=22
2366

1   variety of complicated ways and to see how the

2   engineering features of the product influence the

3   exposures that people have.

4            And the lab itself now has probably 60,000

5   packs of cigarettes. We track them over time. Just

6   like following people over time to see how things

7   change, we do the same with the product and then map

8   that on to the studies that we do with smokers to see

9   how things are changing over time and how that relates

10   to disease patterns and so on.

11             I started this lab in 2002. It's still

12   operational. In fact, it's one of the largest tobacco

13   product testing labs outside of the tobacco companies,

14   that I am aware of. We do the chemistries -- we

15   outsource those, outsource that work. We have people

16   do the smoke chemistries on it. But there's a lot of

17   other design features that we do in the lab.

18       Q.   And what has been your involvement with this

19   lab?

20       A.   I have NIH grants that I lead that are part

21    of this.

22       Q.   What are H grants?

23       A.   NIH. The National Institute.

24       Q.   Oh, NIH. I'm sorry. I heard H.

25       A.   And it's part of the research that we're 2367

1    doing. The health authorities are interested to know

2   why people get sick from smoking and why they find it

3   hard to quit. And you have to understand the product

4   in order to understand the behavior and then the

5   exposures and then the disease rates.

6       Q.   And during that time and in your career, have

7   you taken the cigarettes and de-engineered them?

8       A.   Yes.

9       Q.   And have you written on that as well?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   Studied on it?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   Researched on it?

14       A.   Yes.

15       Q.   And studied the contents and effectiveness of

16   filters?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   As part of--why?

19       A.   Well, most cigarettes today have a filter.

20   Most people believe the filter is better. We've

21    discovered there are some problems with the filter.

22   More uniform delivery of smaller particles that get

23   deeper into the lungs. That actually is bad. Some of

24   the material comes off or can come off. We've studied

25   that and written studies on it. And I've done studies 2368

1   of what consumers believe about filters. Most people

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=23
2   think that the filter makes the product safer, and it

3   doesn't.

4            And so that's an important design feature of

5   the product. It certainly affects how people smoke.

6   And the way that filter is engineered, because there

7   are a variety of different filters, designs. And

8   that's important as well when you want to understand

9   the exposures that people get.

10       Q.   All right. And in connection, did you also

11    examine then over the years, 30 years, compare the

12   cigarette makeup, the cigarette design and what's in it

13   and how that changed over the time, or did change over

14   the time and still changes over the time?

15       A.   I continued to do that research. A lot of

16   the formulas for brands are not public. They are

17   proprietary. So they are not necessarily easy to

18   discern from the documents. But I certainly have seen

19   documents that talk about design modifications that

20   have been made to products over time, how that's

21    changed. And it's interesting to then look and see

22   whether they were informing consumers about products.

23   Because one small change in the design can dramatically

24   alter how people smoke, the exposures they get and so

25   on. And that's really important to understand. 2369

1        Q.   And have you, as part of that process,

2   studied and in detail how they engineered -- how they

3   engineered and designed the cigarettes? Can you tell

4   the jury about that?

5       A.   Sure. You know, the design of the product, I

6   usually look and map in three categories:

7            The blend of the product so what they are

8   putting into the product in the way of tobacco and

9   tobacco material. That makes a difference. Additives

10   that are put in as well as the engineering features

11    that have to do with the paper, you know, the chemicals

12   sprayed on the paper that control the burn temperature

13   and so on. The filter is a big design feature, because

14   it really does influence how people suck on the

15   cigarette and the exposures that they get. So I've

16   done research and had grants to study that topic.

17       Q.   You mentioned the word "grants."

18            And let's go to the next slide, if we could,

19   which I think --

20            This for the time frame of 1984 to 2011. And

21    maybe you can talk -- we can talk about that. How many

22   grants have you received while you were at Roswell Park

23   that dealt with the issue of cigarette smoking and

24   health, including design?

25       A.   More than 50 grants or contracts, most of 2370

1   which are grants.

2       Q.   Now the grants are given to whom?

3       A.   They come to the institution. They don't

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=24
4   come to me. They go to the -- they came to Roswell.

5   Now they come to the Medical University of South

6   Carolina. They administer the funds. There are rules

7   for how you administer those funds. And I've served as

8   the principal investigator, just the director and, you

9   know, you sort of take responsibility for, you know,

10   executing the promised research that's offered in the

11    research proposal.

12       Q.   And let me go over a few of those grants, if

13   we could for a moment. You talked to the jury just

14   briefly about it. Did you receive a grant from the

15   National Cancer Institute and successfully receive and

16   work on marketing to youths, evidence from the

17   corporate documents?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   And you mentioned your quit line, and you

20   talked about that. Who was that grant from you said?

21        A.   The quit line?

22       Q.   Yes.

23       A.   From New York State.

24       Q.   And did you receive a grant from the National

25   Cancer Institute to study the impact of marketing on 2371

1    smoking behavior?

2       A.   Yes, I have.

3       Q.   Briefly, what's that about?

4       A.   To study the marketing and smoking. We were

5   actually developing, you know, anti-smoking

6   commercials. And we were testing them in different

7   test markets to see what effect it would have on

8   basically motivating women, because they were targeted

9   to women smokers to encourage them to try to quit

10   smoking. So call it a quit line essentially.

11        Q.   And a grant for -- I'm skipping over a little

12   bit. Effective anti-smoking communications?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   And have you received a grant from the

15   National Cancer Institute through another contractor at

16   Yale for projects to increase information for high

17   school students to prevent them from starting smoking?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   Tell the jury, why would you do -- why would

20   you have a grant to increase information to high school

21    students about smoking? What did you learn before or

22   during or prior to doing that grant?

23            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

24       Relevance and the question calls for a narrative.

25            THE COURT: Overruled. 2372

1            THE WITNESS: Very simply, high school

2       students are where most smoking gets started,

3       middle and high school. And so what we were doing

4       with this particular study with our colleagues

5       from Yale University was designing an intervention

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=25
6       at the school level to incentivize kids not to

7       take up smoking. And we were seeing whether that

8       would actually have a deterrent effect on the

9       number of young people who take up smoking, and

10       among the smokers, whether it would actually

11        encourage some to quit.

12            So we actually offered a, you know, series of

13       incentives that kids could get so long as they

14       weren't smoking. That was the program. It worked

15       pretty well. It was a little pilot study for two

16       years, four high schools, two in New York, two in

17       Connecticut. And there is an application now to

18       try to expand that and test that across a wider

19       array of schools.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'm about to go

21        into his writing career, and you mentioned you

22       wanted to take a break.

23            THE COURT: Are we at a good breaking point?

24            MR. UITERWYK: Yes, Your Honor.

25            THE COURT: All right. Let me see counsel up 2373

1        at side bar before I grant a recess.

2            (At the bench.)

3            THE COURT: Let me talk to Ms. Burrell for a

4       minute. But after that we are going to go to

5       lunch.

6            And I want to put to you this question as to

7       find out how long we should excuse the jury for,

8       so we don't have them coming back early and sit in

9       the jury room for an hour. Hopefully, that won't

10       happen. It won't happen. I'm stating it

11       positively. It won't happen.

12            How much more time are we going to need to go

13       through the documents that we need to go through

14       for today's examination?

15            MR. UITERWYK: I have no idea what they are

16       going to be saying about it, Judge.

17            THE COURT: Well how many more documents do

18       you need to put up?

19            MR. UITERWYK: Oh, my guess is documents and

20       slides --

21             THE COURT: Yeah.

22            MR. UITERWYK: Today?

23            THE COURT: Yes.

24            MR. UITERWYK: Thirty, 40.

25            THE COURT: Okay. Any estimate as -- as to 2374

1        the time we need to devote to any objections you

2       have?

3            MR. WALKER: At least a half hour, if we're

4       going to try to go through all the ones he is

5       going to use today.

6            THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

7            MR. UITERWYK: And most of the documents are

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=26
8       exhibits, Your Honor, that we're -- some of the

9       exhibits -- very few, actually, today. All the

10       exhibits that were going to be today, which are

11        not a lot of exhibits, they have all been ruled on

12       by Judge Pendino as far as their admissibility is

13       concerned.

14            THE COURT: Okay. All right. Thank you.

15            (In open court.)

16            THE COURT: Members of the jury, in an effort

17       to maximize our time and your time so that I don't

18       call you back early and have you --

19            There are a number of issues that I need to

20       take up with the lawyers at lunch. And rather

21        than me have you come back early and sit in the

22       jury room while we are doing that, it would be

23       better for me to give you an extended lunch, and

24       hopefully when you come back we could hit the

25       ground running. That's my hope. One can only 2375

1        hope.

2            So I'm going to give you a little bit of an

3       extra lunch time. And we're only going -- so you

4       know that we are working, we're only going to take

5       a half an hour lunch, and I'm going to give you an

6       hour and a half lunch. So hopefully in that

7       additional hour that the lawyers and I spend

8       together, we can resolve all of the issues we need

9       to resolve so that this afternoon's session will

10       go as smoothly as possible. So you have some idea

11        of there's a method to our madness.

12            So we'll be in recess until -- it's 12:30.

13       It will be 2 o'clock by the courtroom clock. Bear

14       in mind my instructions.

15            And, Ms. Burrell, we need for you to stay

16       seated because you --1 need to take up an issue

17       with you. So if you will stay in the courtroom.

18            The rest of you are excused until 2 o'clock.

19       Thank you.

20            (Members of the jury panel retired from the

21        courtroom.)

22            THE COURT: Dr. Cummings, you may step down

23       and wait outside. Thank you.

24            You may be seated.

25            (The witness retired from the stand.) 2376

1            THE COURT: Ms. Burrell, how are you this

2       morning?

3            JUROR BURRELL: I'm good, thanks.

4            THE COURT: Good. Ms. Burrell the bailiff

5       has told me, and I informed the lawyers, that you

6       had a very brief conversation with him during the

7       last break where you advised him that when some

8       records were put up on the screen, you either knew

9       the doctor or worked for the doctor, or you knew

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=27
10       him and worked for him. Do I have that correct?

11             JUROR BURRELL: Both.

12            THE COURT: Both. You know the doctor and

13       you worked for him?

14            JUROR BURRELL: Yeah. I recognized his

15       signature.

16            THE COURT: And who is that?

17            A JUROR: Dr. Halsey at Hillsborough Medical

18       Allergy and Asthma.

19            THE COURT: Dr. Halsey?

20            JUROR BURRELL: Yes.

21            THE COURT: And do you still work there?

22            JUROR BURRELL: No.

23            THE COURT: And how long did you work for

24       him?

25            JUROR BURRELL: Three and a half years. 2377

1            THE COURT: Okay. All right. Does counsel

2       wish -- counsel approach, please.

3       Mr. Trentalange, would you approach, please?

4            MR. BIGGER: Do you need him too?

5            THE COURT: No, you can stay.

6            (A discussion off the record)

7            (At the bench)

8            THE COURT: Mr. Trentalange, I believe you

9       were the lawyer who read off the names of the

10       witnesses, were you not?

11             MS. HUMPHRIES: I was, Your Honor.

12            THE COURT: From memory, do you recall

13       whether or not you called out the name of Dr.

14       Halsey?

15            MS. HUMPHRIES: I recall that he wasn't on

16       the list. I didn't call him out.

17            MR. BIGGER: He's not a potential witness.

18            THE COURT: Okay.

19            MR. SEIDEN: My view on this, I would like an

20       opportunity overnight to review the records that

21        relate to that individual, and then I can have a

22       more informed position in the morning on this,

23       Your Honor. I've got to see exactly what it is he

24       said in records which are in evidence.

25            MS. HUMPHRIES: My opposition, Your Honor, is 2378

1        those records have been in existence for a long

2       time, and they had ample opportunity during the

3       four days of voir dire to question anybody they

4       wanted to question about that. And they didn't do

5       it. Now I read the case. They certainty were

6       foreclosed.

7            THE COURT: The list that you read from, how

8       was that list compiled?

9            MS. HUMPHRIES: It was people that we

10       expected to be testifying at trial.

11             THE COURT: Who is "we"?

12            MR. BIGGER: It was a joint submission. I

13       think the defense actually prepared it, to be

14       honest. But it was a joint witness list.

15            THE COURT: Well, I can't preclude you from

16       raising something. But as of now, do you have any

17       objection to Ms. Burrell continuing?

18            MR. SEIDEN: As of right now, no. But, Your

19       Honor, as this has come out, there's 3,000 pages

20       of medical records. And they are in evidence.

21        And I would like the opportunity to review.

22            THE COURT: Mr. Pedrosa, anything?

23            MR. PEDROSA: Nothing different.

24            THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

25            (In open court) 2379

1            THE COURT: Thank you for bringing it to our

2       attention. You are excused. There is no need to

3       discuss this with your fellow jurors.

4            JUROR BURRELL: Okay.

5            THE COURT: And you are excused for lunch

6       until 2 o'clock. Thank you.

7            JUROR BURRELL: Okay.

8            (The juror retired from the courtroom.)

9            THE COURT: All right. We'll be in recess

10       until -- can everybody reasonably get lunch --

11        everybody that needs to? I'm concerned about the

12       lawyers and their staff getting lunch in a half an

13       hour. Can everybody do that so we can be back at

14        1 o'clock or 1:05?

15            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

16            MR. BIGGER: Yes, Your Honor.

17            THE COURT: All right. We'll be in recess

18       until 1:05. Thank you.

19            MS. HUMPHRIES: Your Honor, we did deliver

20       those proposed orders to you. Opposing counsel

21        was correct, we had not yet sent them.

22            THE COURT: Okay.

6                CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION

7   BY MR. UITERWYK:

8       Q.   Dr. Cummings, when we broke for lunch, I

9   believe we were on the issue -- not the issue. On the

10   subject of your qualifications. And what I was going

11    to go to next is the -- your area in the field of your

12   expertise in publishing on those areas that you'll be

13   testifying to for this jury. And in connection with

14   that, have you published in medical journals,

15   textbooks, monographs, things of that nature?

16       A.   I have.

17       Q.   And have you published in peer-reviewed

18   publications?

19       A.   Mostly in peer-reviewed publications. That's

20   what you do as a scientist.

21        Q.   We heard either yesterday --1 believe it was

22   yesterday -- from Dr. Mannino what peer-reviewed

23   publications are. Can you briefly tell us the type of

24   peer-reviewed -- would you explain to the jury what a

25   peer-reviewed publication is? 2430

1        A.   You have other scientists who have expertise

2   in the field who review the, you know, research report

3   that you send in to the medical journal, and they

4   review the methods that are used, the findings and how

5   you arrived at those findings, and they make a judgment

6   about whether it meets a certain standard of excellence

7   so you're advancing science, you're offering new

8   discoveries or validating previous discoveries, and,

9   you know, essentially the findings are reliable and

10   valid.

11             And that's the process that they use, use in

12   most journals. I have edited a few journals. We

13   select four reviewers for a paper, they will send back

14   comments, and there is often iterative process. But

15   many medical journals, most that I publish in, I would

16   say, maybe they take about 10 percent of the papers

17   that they receive. So 90 percent don't get in the

18   journal.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=33
19       Q.   Sorry. Let's see slide No. 8.

20            How many peer-reviewed publications have

21    you -- articles have you published?

22       A.   It's over 340 papers. I have been at this

23   for a while.

24       Q.   How long is a while?

25       A.   About 33 years now. 2431

1        Q.   And in connection with each peer-reviewed

2   publication, do most of them involve research studies

3   and -- in order to publish these papers?

4       A.   Yeah. I mean, there are a few on the list

5   that are reviews of the science where you sort of do

6   what they refer to as a meta-analysis of findings of

7   other people, the other peer-reviewed literature. But

8   most of my stuff is original studies that I have

9   published -- you know, publish or perish in the medical

10   fields.

11        Q.   For most of these publications, are you paid?

12       A.   No.

13       Q.   You do it for what reason?

14            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

15       Relevance.

16            THE COURT: I'm going to sustain the

17       objection.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   Let's talk about the areas that you've

20   published in. And that's shown up to save a little

21    time. Have we listed some of these subject matters

22   that you published on?

23       A.   You have.

24       Q.   All right. And you have How Patients and

25   Consumers Perceive Messages? 2432

1        A.   Correct.

2       Q.   Can you tell us what that is about?

3       A.   Sure. I have done studies to know what

4   smokers know and believe about the health risks of

5   smoking and -- smoking and how they respond to both

6   anti-smoking messages, because we've designed

7   campaigns, as well as how they respond to things like,

8   you know, product warnings, product labeling that's

9   been used on products, things like labels that used to

10   appear, like, lights, mild, low tar, those kinds of

11    things.

12       Q.   Was that primarily in the area of cigarettes?

13       A.   Yeah. Almost all my research has been in the

14   area of tobacco, and I would say 99 percent of it has

15   been on cigarettes, although I have published some on

16   other, you know, types of products, like oral tobacco,

17   smokeless tobacco products.

18       Q.   And have you published in the area of smoking

19   behaviors?

20       A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=34
21        Q.   What do you mean by smoking behaviors?

22       A.   Uptake, cessation, relapse. Those are

23   essentially the behaviors that I focus on. Amount

24   smoked, how you smoke it. Literally how deeply you

25   puff it, the number of the puffs. I mean, because 2433

1   people will smoke cigarettes very differently. Even

2   though they smoke the same number of cigarettes, they

3   have done little micro behavior studies, having people

4   smoke through computers, because machines don't tell

5   you what people get exposed to, but you can actually

6   measure this in a variety of ways. I have used the

7   computers -- the cigarette filter actually gives you a

8   lot of information. And I've published studies on how

9   to -- methods of looking at the amount of the nicotine

10   or tar or other chemicals in the filter when you digest

11    the filter, will actually give you a measure of how

12   much exposure people have to various chemicals in the

13   cigarettes.

14       Q.   And do you have any -- the next item is

15   Diagnosing and Treating Nicotine Addiction.

16            How much research and publication have you

17   done in that area?

18       A.   Well, I would say most of my work is in that

19   area. It's all been -- you know, I have done some on

20   uptake, but most of my research has been on the process

21    of understanding why people have a hard time trying to

22   quit and testing methods to help people quit, testing

23   the various methods that are out there that people are

24   using and whether they work or not.

25       Q.   Do you also in that regard do the research on 2434

1   nicotine addiction itself?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   And how to determine and diagnose nicotine

4   addiction?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   And you've published quite a bit in that

7   area?

8       A.   I have.

9       Q.   All right. Now -- and we've talked, I

10   believe, about cigarette filters in general, cigarette

11    design. But let's talk -- we talked about filters.

12   Let's talk about general cigarette design.

13            And can you tell the jury the different

14   peer-reviewed publications that you've done in the

15   field of cigarette design?

16       A.   Well, I mean --

17       Q.   And research.

18       A.   Yeah. You'll have to go through my CV to

19   look at them, but I have probably had about 20 or so

20   publications on that topic alone. I've got a monograph

21    coming out through the World Health Organization on the

22   topic of product design, because, again, this relates

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=35
23   to the exposures and to the product engineering. So in

24   order to understand how people smoke and why they

25   continue to smoke, you have to understand the aspects 2435

1    of the product design.

2       Q.   I want to get a little bit more into this.

3       A.   Sure.

4       Q.   Okay. Can you tell the jury basically, when

5   you say you're doing a monograph coming out on the

6   field of product design, first of all, what is a

7   monograph?

8       A.   A monograph is -- it's like a book, except

9   the authors are invited not just to contribute

10   chapters, but they contribute elements of the book.

11    And then the editor of the monograph usually, you know,

12   pulls it together.

13            So I have served as the editor of monographs.

14   I have also served as a contributor, as one of those

15   people writing sections of the book, which is

16   peer-reviewed as these go out. They don't just take

17   them and publish them like it was a book you buy, you

18   know, at the bookstore. This goes through a peer

19   review process, at least the ones that I have done

20   through either the National Cancer Institute or the

21   World Health Organization.

22       Q.   And you mentioned that you were doing a

23   monograph -- you were participating on a monograph on

24   cigarette design?

25       A.   That's right. It's actually on the topic of 2436

1   product regulation.

2       Q.   What does that mean?

3       A.   Well, different governments around the world

4   are now beginning to create rules for the, you know,

5   control of the production of cigarettes, how they're

6   engineered, and how they're labeled and marketed, and

7   consumers are informed about the products. There are

8   rules that exist in different countries.

9            So this particular monograph compares whether

10   they have been working or not. So some of the research

11    that we've done on some of the existing regulations

12   that exist.

13       Q.   How does the product design become involved

14   in that?

15       A.   Well, product design, in order to understand

16   some of these rules -- for example, some countries just

17   have set limits on amount of tar and nicotine based on

18   a machine measure that can exist in cigarettes. This

19   exists in Europe today. They call it the 10-1-10 rule.

20   Ten milligrams of the tar, one millimeter of nicotine,

21    and 10 milligrams of carbon dioxide.

22            We were interested to see whether that rule

23   was actually changing people's exposures and how the

24   cigarettes would change. What we discovered was the

25   filter -- the product hardly changed at all. The 2437

1   filter changed. And what the companies did was

2   basically put in more filter vents into the filter

3   so --

4            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

5       Nonresponsive.

6            THE COURT: All right. Sustained.

7            Put in another question, please.

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   All right. My question was how what you're

10   doing in connection with that monograph involves

11    design. And I believe you were talking about now

12   cigarettes as being part of the design, obviously.

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   Can you continue on that, please, and how --

15   what are you doing to evaluate and to investigate the

16   design, and how does that get you involved in the

17   design of the cigarette and the filter?

18       A.   Compare the product before the regulation,

19   after the regulation, measure the exposures in people

20   using the product before and after to see whether it

21    changes. Those are one of the ways that we've

22   investigated that.

23            For policies that have existed a long time,

24   you can look at the effect on consumer behavior over a

25   long period of time, like the introduction of filters 2438

1    and uptake of filters, and then whether that related to

2   mortality patterns down the line. Similarly with low

3   tar. And so there have been a variety of studies that

4   I have done on that topic as well.

5       Q.   You're going to be talking during the course

6   of this trial about cigarette design and filter design.

7   Can you tell the jury what areas you've researched and

8   published in that involve the question of cigarette

9   design?

10       A.   Well, filters, low tar. The filter is

11    defective because the smoker, when they smoke a filter,

12   will actually get exposed to some of the bits that they

13   make the filter out of, cellulose acetate, and about 12

14   to 14,000 little fibers that make up an individual

15   cigarette filter. And when you touch that filter to

16   your tongue, some of these bits ball off on your

17   tongue. We've measured those --

18            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

19            THE WITNESS: -- in the lungs of the smokers.

20   BY MR. UITERWYK:

21        Q.   What I was specifically --

22            MR. WALKER: Nonresponsive. There is another

23       objection I need to make.

24            THE COURT: Sustained.

25            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Your Honor. 2439

1   BY MR. UITERWYK:

2       Q.   What I was specifically getting at,

3   Dr. Cummings, if you could tell the jury what you've

4   done in the area of cigarette design? I don't need you

5   to necessarily go into what results come out of that,

6   but what you've done in the area of the cigarette

7   design that gives you this specialty.

8       A.   Well, I have done research to examine

9   different elements of cigarette design. I have

10   conducted that research, created a lab to back-engineer

11    the product so we can do those studies. And I have

12   published the results of those studies in peer-reviewed

13   publications and in, you know, various monographs like

14   the Surgeon General's reports.

15       Q.   All right. And you mentioned that you

16   published in about -- published about 20 peer-reviewed

17   articles on the issue of cigarette design?

18       A.   At least.

19       Q.   All right. And in doing that, have you

20   studied, examined, analyzed, investigated how the

21    cigarette companies design their cigarettes?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   How long have you been doing that?

24       A.   My work on cigarette design has essentially

25   been going on since 1990. 2440

1        Q.   And in the process of doing that, have you

2   published and been accepted in peer-reviewed articles,

3   publications with respect to cigarette design?

4            MR. WALKER: Objection. Asked and answered.

5            THE COURT: Overruled.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Go ahead.

8       A.   Yes.

9       Q.   All right. And have you also -- have you

10   spoken on the issue of cigarette design?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Have you appeared in front of other

13   organizations as far as cigarette design is concerned?

14       A.   Yes. I was even invited to R.J. Reynolds

15   because of the work that I was doing on cigarette

16   design.

17       Q.   Tell us about that.

18       A.   Sure. I published one of the early studies

19   on one of their novel products that used a carbon heat

20   source to heat rather than burn tobacco. And as a

21    result of that, I was one of three other scientists who

22   were invited to come down to Reynolds and meet with

23   their scientists to discuss this product, which was not

24   yet out on the market. Actually, the discovery of the

25   product was in a test market in Buffalo. 2441

1        Q.   Have you, in the process of doing this

2   studying over the last 22 years, have you investigated

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=38
3   and researched what the cigarette companies have done

4   with regard to the design, engineering, and

5   manipulation of the cigarette itself to increase

6   inhalability?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Tell us about that.

9       A.   Sure. Well, they have engineered --

10       Q.   No, I don't want you to tell us what they've

11    done. Tell us what you have researched and what --

12       A.   Sure. I looked at some of their internal

13   business records on aspects of how they engineer their

14   product, both in terms of the blending, the use of

15   additives and the engineering of the product that

16   facilitates inhalation, which is the key to nicotine

17   addiction.

18       Q.   All right. Have we covered the areas--in

19   the area of design manipulation and engineering of

20   cigarettes that you worked in?

21        A.   Broadly you have.

22       Q.   Any more specifics?

23       A.   Well, I have had grants. I've had contracts

24   from the government to help them develop the methods

25   that they're using now to assess cigarette design as 2442

1   part of the regulatory process.

2       Q.   Tell the jury about that.

3       A.   Sure. Well, the Food and Drug Administration

4   now has regulatory authority over cigarettes. And in

5   anticipation of them getting that authority, the

6   National Cancer Institute funded a huge contract to

7   develop some of the methods that the FDA would rely on.

8   In other words, the methods that could be validated, so

9   when they ask manufacturers for information about their

10   products, they know what methods to ask them to do so

11    they know they're getting back reliable and valid data.

12       Q.   What have you done in that regard, with

13   regard to the FDA?

14       A.   Well, as was part of our tobacco testing lab,

15   the FDA --1 mean, like many scientists, I have

16   contributed comments as a scientist to the FDA. I have

17   participated in meetings with the FDA on various topics

18   related to my expertise in product design as well as

19   labeling of products which are under their purview.

20       Q.   Have you been asked by any other institutions

21    or organizations in the area of the cigarette design?

22       A.   Sure. I mean, the original work that we did

23   on the methods was the National Cancer Institute. That

24   was a contract from them. And then I have done the

25   monograph for the World Health Organization. Actually, 2443

1   this is the second one. I did one for a group called

2   the International Agency of Research on Cancer, I ARC.

3   And we did a monograph for them, I think it was in

4   2009. And the other one is in the works now.

5       Q.   On what?

6       A.   The one that's in the works?

7       Q.   No. You told us about the one in the works.

8   What's the one you did previously?

9       A.   On evaluating basically public policies on

10   smoking behavior and the, you know, relationship to use

11    of tobacco products, which included a major section on

12   product regulation.

13       Q.   All right. Let's go forward quickly through

14   the additional qualifications and publications you've

15   done. We've talked about -- probably a little bit

16   about this. Smoking cessation, quitting, motivation,

17   withdrawal, and relapse. Have you basically published

18   in all those areas?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   We've talked about nicotine addiction as a

21    cause of disease. Tell the jury what gives you special

22   expertise to publish in the area of nicotine addiction

23   as a cause of disease.

24       A.   Well, I have studied both, you know, the

25   effect of nicotine addiction on smoking behavior, which 2444

1   is the link to get sick from smoking.

2       Q.   Explain that. Explain what you mean by that.

3       A.   Well, I mean, people don't get sick from the

4   smoke from one or two cigarettes. They get sick from

5   smoking from -- as a result of repeating that exposure

6   year in and year out for decades. And why people

7   continue to smoke over an extended period of time and

8   the amount that they're smoking is directly related

9   to-

10            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Lack of

11        foundation.

12            THE COURT: Overruled.

13            THE WITNESS: --your addiction to the

14       product.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   All right. And what additional research and

17   publication have you done in the area of the nicotine

18   addiction as a cause of the disease?

19       A.   I mean, again, I have studied cohorts,

20   probably the largest studies done in the United States,

21    and actually in most of the world. At this point, I

22   have studies in 23 different countries going on

23   currently. We're tracking the smoking behaviors of

24   thousands of smokers and have been doing so in the

25   United States since the late 1980s. And those studies 2445

1   have allowed us to see changes in people's smoking

2   behavior, because we go back to the same individuals to

3   see how they change. So I can look at whether it's

4   simply an easy thing to quit, who is able to quit, who

5   is able to sustain quitting. And that's a lot of the,

6   you know, unique expertise that I bring to the field.

7       Q.   All right. And have you given talks with

8   regard to nicotine addiction as a cause of disease?

9       A.   Sure. I give lectures to our medical

10   students, dental students. I have done many, many

11    talks right from kindergarten right up.

12       Q.   Have you actually, as part of your

13   professorship at the medical school, have you taught on

14   the issue of nicotine addiction as a cause of disease?

15            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, may we approach?

16            THE COURT: Okay.

17            MR. WALKER: Just briefly.

18            (At the bench)

19            MR. WALKER: Judge, I'm confident that

20       Mr. Uiterwyk is not doing it intentionally, but

21        he's violating your rule about proximity to the

22       jury. He's drifting ever closer and closer to the

23       jury box.

24            MR. UITERWYK: I didn't -

25            MR. WALKER: I didn't want to call it to his 2446

1        attention in open court.

2            MR. UITERWYK: Thank you for calling it to

3       me.

4            MR. WALKER: Okay. Thank you, Judge.

5            (In open court)

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   I believe my question was, Dr. Cummings, is,

8   have you taught in connection with your professorships

9   at the medical schools on nicotine addiction and as a

10   cause of disease?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Who do you teach?

13       A.   I teach the medical students. I have done

14   continuing medical education, programs, so for doctors

15   who are out in practice, all specialties, addiction

16   medicine, you know, respiratory medicine. You know,

17   basically just about every category you can think of.

18       Q.   And any other additional research that we

19   haven't discussed regarding nicotine addiction as a

20   cause of disease?

21        A.   No. I think we've covered it.

22       Q.   Okay. Can nicotine cause disease?

23       A.   Yeah. Nicotine is a poison, so if you get

24   too much nicotine, pure nicotine is -- will kill you.

25   Its main use in the world before smoking was as an 2447

1   insecticide.

2       Q.   And how does addiction to nicotine cause a

3   disease?

4       A.   Well, obviously, the amount of the nicotine

5   that somebody gets in cigarette smoke is at a much

6   lower dose than a lethal one. But it is -- it alters

7   the structure, the wiring in the brain essentially, and

8   people become -- they need the drug in order to feel

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=41
9   normal. In the absence of the drug, they feel

10   abnormal. We call that withdrawal. And so it's very

11    similar to other drug addictions, like cocaine and

12   heroin, in that regard.

13       Q.   And taking it one step, how does it cause a

14   disease?

15       A.   It's the repeated use of the product. So it

16   contributes to people finding it hard to give up using

17   a product, so they continue to use it over and over and

18   over again until -- and some people get sick.

19       Q.   Have you also done epidemiological studies as

20   it relates to nicotine addiction, smoking cigarettes as

21    a cause of diseases?

22       A.   I have.

23       Q.   Tell the jury about that, please.

24       A.   Well, I have looked at the relationship

25   between how much somebody smokes, indicators of 2448

1   nicotine addiction, and whether that's correlated with

2   an increased risk of diseases, like COPD or lung cancer

3   or bladder cancer. A whole variety of diseases. And

4   there is a definite dose-response relationship. So the

5   more dependent somebody is, the more addicted somebody

6   is to the drug, the greater the likelihood that those

7   individuals become sick as a result of their use.

8       Q.   And have you written on cigarette marketing,

9   including youth marketing?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   Basically, all your research has been done

12   concentrating on cigarettes, nicotine addiction causing

13   diseases and design; is that correct?

14       A.   Yeah, in the area of cancer prevention.

15       Q.   All right. Have you been a contributing

16   author of a journal article called Failed Promises of

17   the Cigarette Industry and Its Effect on Consumers

18   About the Risks of Smoking?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   Briefly tell the jury about that.

21        A.   Sure. I looked at the explicit promises that

22   were made by manufacturers to consumers back in the

23   early 1950s, whether they fulfilled those promises, and

24   the effect of what they actually did because they

25   didn't fulfill those promises -- thus the title, Failed 2449

1   Promises -- on consumer knowledge and beliefs about

2   smoking. And essentially it kept people smoking

3   longer, because it gave people an excuse, a

4   psychological crutch and self-rationale to keep

5   smoking.

6       Q.   I believe we've already talked about the

7   article -- you've written a number of articles and

8   papers about the secret business records of the

9   companies that we talked about a moment ago.

10       A.   That's right.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=42
11        Q.   All right. Now, in addition to being --

12   presenting publications, presenting articles for

13   publication in peer-reviewed publications, have you

14   also been an editor and/or reviewer for peer-reviewed

15   publications?

16       A.   I have.

17       Q.   All right. Let's go to slide No. 7 - slide

18   5, please.

19            All right. First of all, what do you do as a

20   reviewer or editor?

21        A.   Well, as a reviewer, you essentially get a

22   paper or a report, and you go through it and you

23   critique it based on how comprehensive it is, whether

24   the hypothesis is a reasonable one, and then the

25   methods that were applied, and you read the findings 2450

1    and the conclusions of the author, and you usually

2   write a little critique back to the authors as to

3   things that you want -- usually it's asking for

4   clarification of information, and sometimes it's just

5   frankly disagreeing with the conclusions that are

6   written and wanting to see more justification.

7       Q.   And we have prepared a slide on this, have we

8   not?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   And one of the journals you've written,

11    you've been a reviewer for or an editor of the American

12   Medical Association?

13       A.   That's correct.

14       Q.   And the British Medical Journal?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   And were you a reviewer for the Nicotine &

17   Tobacco Research Publication?

18       A.   That's right. That's from the Society For

19   Research on Nicotine and Tobacco.

20       Q.   And the Journal of Behavorial Medicine?

21        A.   Correct.

22       Q.   And the Journal on Addictive Behaviors. What

23   is that?

24       A.   That's a journal that does exactly what the

25   title says. It studies addictive behaviors of things 2451

1   like alcohol, cocaine, heroin, and tobacco will be part

2   of that, nicotine.

3       Q.   You have up there Lancet. What is Lancet?

4       A.   That's a British medical journal. It's been

5   around for over a hundred years. And it's very

6   prestigious, sort of like their version of our New

7   England Journal of Medicine.

8       Q.   All right. And then the Annals of Internal

9   Medicine?

10       A.   Right. That's the specialty publication for

11   primary care, usually internal medicine doctors; that's

12   put out by the same publishers of the Journal of the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=43
13   American Medical Association.

14       Q.   And then going quickly. Preventive Medicine.

15   And you also -- strike that. Correct?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   And then we talk about the editorial board

18   for a moment. Were you on the Health Education

19   Quarterly from '85 to '94?

20       A.   Yeah. I did that for about a decade.

21        Q.   And were you on the editorial board for

22   Cancer Epidemiology: Biomarkers and Prevention From

23   '91 to'2003?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   What is that publication about? 2452

1        A.   Well, it's put out by the American

2   Association of Cancer Research. And this is their

3   journal on prevention. And so it publishes all kinds

4   of studies about, you know, cancer prevention, from

5   chemo prevention, strategies, diet and cancer,

6   screening, tobacco, other environmental sources of

7   cancer, basic biology, right through to population

8   health kinds of studies.

9       Q.   And finally, were you on the Editorial Board

10   For Tobacco Control?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   From'91 to'2004?

13       A.   Right. I served as deputy editor from about

14    1997 to 2004.

15       Q.   All right. I want to speed up a little bit.

16   Let's go to slide No. 9, if we could.

17            Can you tell us briefly about -- we talked

18   some about this already -- your involvement in training

19   others and speaking to others on how to diagnose and

20   treat nicotine addiction?

21        A.   Correct.

22       Q.   Can you -- have we covered that waterfront,

23   or do you have some other organizations where you give

24   lectures and testimony that we haven't discussed?

25       A.   No. I think -- this gives you a list. I 2453

1   would add school children. I, you know, do a lot of

2   going into schools and educate students of all ages

3   about the health risks of smoking.

4       Q.   Have you testified before legislative bodies

5   about your areas, in your areas of expertise?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   Regarding what?

8       A.   Smoking and health.

9       Q.   All right. Now, the jury has heard about the

10   Surgeon General. Let's talk about, first of all, who

11    is the Surgeon General?

12       A.   Virginia Benjamin is the current Surgeon

13   General. You know, essentially appointed by the

14   president, usually considered the top doctor in the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=44
15   United States. They lead the Public Health Service

16   and, you know, have, you know, basically since 1964

17   been affiliated with the Surgeon General's reports on

18   smoking and health.

19       Q.   I think some of us who may remember it, C.

20   Everett Koop. Was he one who wore the --

21            Well, actually do they wear uniforms?

22       A.   Yes. They're part of the Public Health

23   Service, which is part of our armed forces. There are

24   actually Surgeon Generals for each of the parts of the

25   military. 2454

1        Q.   All right. And what's the mission of the

2   Public Health Service?

3       A.   Basically to inform and advise the government

4   about ways to promote the public's health and prevent

5   disease.

6       Q.   And over the years, have you worked alongside

7   the Attorney General in the areas of nicotine addiction

8   and disease?

9       A.   The Attorney General or the Surgeon General?

10       Q.   I meant to say Surgeon General. All right.

11    Thank you.

12       A.   Yeah. I certainly have. I've worked with

13   many of the Surgeon Generals over the years, you know,

14   dating to Julius Richmond, who was the Surgeon General

15   during Jimmy Carter, and every Surgeon General since.

16   Dr. Koop I know quite well. So I know them all pretty

17   much.

18       Q.   Have you contributed and been a reviewer of

19   the Surgeon General's report on smoking?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Reports. I may say that in plural.

22       A.   I started in 1988. The one on nicotine

23   addiction, I was a reviewer. And then in '89,1

24   contributed a chapter and have been involved in just

25   about every report since. 2455

1        Q.   So you've been involved in which reports, how

2   many reports as either reviewer or contributor?

3       A.   Probably at this point about, you know, ten

4   or so reports that have come out since 1988.

5       Q.   And what does it mean to be a reviewer of the

6   Surgeon General's report?

7       A.   Just like a peer-reviewer of a research

8   article, you're sent a section of the report; you're

9   asked to give a critique. Surgeon General's reports

10   are a summary of the published literature, and they

11    draw conclusions based on that at a given time. And so

12   the reviewers are tasked with making sure that the

13   review that's been done is comprehensive and that the

14   conclusions are drawn from the data and not just

15   somebody's opinion.

16       Q.   And what chapter have you reviewed or

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=45
17   contributed to as it relates to the Surgeon General's

18   reports?

19       A.   Well, most of my work, because my expertise

20   is in health behavior and relates to smoking cessation,

21   but, you know, I also contributed to eighty -- or the

22   '94 report and the 2012 report on uptake of smoking,

23   which would have to do with youth smoking behavior.

24   But now I review the entire thing. So they used to

25   send me sections. Now I get those, and then I now get 2456

1   the entire report. I'm usually one of about five

2   people who are asked to review all, the entire reports

3   when they -- at least the last two I have done that,

4   and I think I will be asked to do it for the 50th

5   anniversary report, which is coming out next year.

6       Q.   All right. You mentioned youth smoking on

7   several occasions. I want to follow up on that for a

8   moment, if we could.

9            Why has that been a particular interest to

10   the public health community and to you as well?

11             MR. WALKER: Objection, relevance, lack of

12       foundation.

13            THE COURT: Overruled.

14            THE WITNESS: The earlier somebody smokes,

15       the more likely they're going to get addicted and

16       the more likely they will get sick if they're

17       addicted.

18            So almost all smoking begins during the

19       teenage years, between the ages of 12 and 24.

20       It's very rare to see somebody take up smoking

21        after the age of 25. It's less than five percent

22       of smokers. So it 

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   So 95 percent of smokers start between the

25   age of 12 and 24? 2457

1        A.   That's right.

2       Q.   And is that something, based on your review

3   of the internal documents of the defendants and other

4   cigarette companies in your comprehensive review, that

5   they knew?

6            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

7            THE COURT: Sustained.

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   All right. What have you determined, in your

10   review of the private, secret, confidential documents

11    during your comprehensive review, as it relates to what

12   the cigarette companies knew about youth smoking?

13       A.   They knew a lot of the youth smoking. They

14   studied youth smoking behavior. They used that

15   information in their marketing plans, which included

16   engineering products that would have unique appeal to

17   young people. So -- because they felt it was crucial

18   to their profitability.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=46
19       Q.   How old was Jackie Loyd when she started

20   smoking?

21        A.   Sixteen.

22       Q.   And what did the cigarette companies do with

23   that information, that study and research that they did

24   as it relates to the youth smoking?

25       A.   What did they do with the information? 2458

1        Q.   Yes.

2       A.   They designed marketing campaigns that would

3   target different segments of the market. And the youth

4   market was one of the segments that they targeted,

5   because, as they said, that would give them replacement

6   smokers for those who quit and died.

7       Q.   Now, I believe you may have said this

8   earlier, that -- or maybe you haven't. Have you

9   written chapters in textbooks used by doctors to teach

10   about the issues that you're going to be speaking to

11    the jury about today?

12       A.   I have.

13       Q.   Have you written book chapters on the subject

14   of nicotine addiction?

15       A.   Yes. For the, you know, basically the last

16   issue that they use to train family doctors.

17       Q.   All right. And we've talked about monographs

18   that you've written as well, correct?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   All right. Let's look at slide No. 7,

21   please. Let's go -- let's go back to slide 4.

22            MR. PHILIPSON: I'm sorry?

23            MR. UITERWYK: Slide No. 4.

24            MR. PHILIPSON: Give me a second.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 2459

1        Q.   Have you been also affiliated with various

2   organizations in the area of your expertise?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   Those that are shown on here?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   Of any -- do you want to point out any of

7   significance, or can you summarize what you've done

8   there, to save time?

9       A.   Sure. I mentioned the Surgeon General's

10   report. The Institute of Medicine, I contributed to a

11    report that they did in the 1990s on nicotine addiction

12   in children. And, you know, various groups that I have

13   done consulting for: The National Cancer Institute,

14   Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, American Cancer

15   Society.

16            And then these are some of the groups, the

17   professional groups that I belong to: American

18   Association of Cancer Research, Society of Preventive

19   Oncology. That's the oncology association for medical

20   oncologists. I have served on their prevention

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=47
21    committee. I wrote the guidelines for oncologists and

22   how to diagnose and treat their cancer patients who

23   have continued to smoke. And the Society For Research

24   on Nicotine and Tobacco. I'm a member, you know, and

25   chaired their policy committee for a couple years and 2460

1   have received awards from them.

2       Q.   All right. Dr. Cummings, have you also been

3   honored by the scientific community in your area of

4   smoking and public health?

5       A.   I have.

6       Q.   And let me read a few of those. Did you

7   receive the 1994 Volunteer Service Award?

8       A.   I did.

9       Q.   By the American Lung Association of New York

10   State?

11        A.   I got that one as well.

12       Q.   And did you receive the Joseph Cullen Award

13   for outstanding research in the area of tobacco

14   control?

15       A.   I did.

16       Q.   And did you receive the John Slade Award for

17   outstanding contributions to public health and tobacco

18   control?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   And the Luther Terry award. First of all,

21    for outstanding research contribution in tobacco

22   control. Who is Luther Terry?

23       A.   Luther Terry was the Surgeon General in 1964.

24   So when he issued the first Surgeon General's report,

25   he was -- he was the Surgeon General at the time. 2461

1        Q.   And what was this award for?

2       A.   It was given out by the Cancer Society at the

3   World Conference On Smoking and Health, which meets

4   every three years. And, you know -- they started to

5   give these awards out in, I think, the 1980s. And they

6   give out in different categories. I received the

7   research award in 2009. So it's very -- it's basically

8   the highest award you can get in my field. And, you

9   know, somebody nominated me. I was fortunate enough to

10   be given the honor. And it was a big deal for me.

11        Q.   Have you been recognized throughout the world

12   in your areas of expertise? And are you proud of your

13   recognition in that regard?

14       A.   Sure. I think --1 think, you know, if you

15   are around long enough, they start to give you awards,

16   I guess.

17            But, you know, I hope I made a difference.

18   That's why I got into the field of public health. And

19   so, you know, I'm proud of what I have done. I would

20   like to do more. I'm not giving up on what I'm doing.

21        Q.   Dr. Cummings, because of your education, your

22   training, your experience in your field of smoking and

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=48
23   health, have you been asked from time to time to

24   testify under oath like you're doing here today and

25   going to be here tomorrow probably related to the very 2462

1    subject of cigarette design, smoking addiction, health,

2   and what the cigarette companies knew and what they did

3   or did not do in that regard?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   And when you come in here and testify in

6   court like this, do you try to convey to the jury the

7   same thing that you conveyed to your medical students

8   or other organizations that you speak to, on the

9   information that we're going to be discussing here,

10   including medical students, nurses, and other

11    organizations?

12       A.   Well, I don't show them excerpts of my CV.

13   But the other material that I will talk about is

14   exactly what I present to, you know, anybody that will

15   listen -- doctors, the nurses, school children, whoever

16   that I'm speaking to. It's the same exact material.

17       Q.   All right. And does the information at all

18   change as far as whether or not nicotine in cigarettes

19   is addictive or how you diagnose whether someone is

20   addicted to cigarettes and nicotine -- addicted to

21    cigarettes containing nicotine?

22       A.   Well, science is always advancing, and I try

23   to stay current with the science. But the story is

24   essentially the same.

25       Q.   All right. And when you were evaluating this 2463

1   particular case and asked to determine or answer the

2   question as to whether or not Ms. Loyd was addicted to

3   nicotine and whether that addiction played a part in

4   the development of her COPD and lung cancer that led to

5   her death, did you do it the same way you would do it

6   for any other patient, or 10,000 -- or how many people

7   did you treat on the quit line or evaluate?

8       A.   Directly worked with over 10,000 smokers

9   through my clinics. And through the quit line, I think

10   we had over a million people contact us there.

11             No, there is nothing that's different. I do

12   use the same method that I use working with, you know,

13   anybody else. I mean, the difference here is you have

14   to rely on material from medical records and, in this

15   case, family members, because Ms. Loyd was not alive to

16   be interviewed.

17       Q.   We all know she had died in 2007, correct?

18       A.   Correct.

19       Q.   But do you have enough information, based on

20   those medical records, on the depositions of Ms. Loyd's

21    family members, and based on your education, your

22   training, your experience, your research, to come to

23   the conclusion as to whether or not Jackie Loyd was

24   addicted to cigarettes and if that addiction to

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=49
25   cigarettes played a part in her development of COPD, 2464

1   lung cancer, and led to her death?

2       A.   Yes, I do have enough information, in my

3   opinion.

4       Q.   All right. By the way, how many -- how many

5   hours do you think you've spent in this case reviewing

6   the case, reviewing the materials, preparing?

7       A.   Okay. Well, it's probably about 40 hours at

8   this point, because some of it has been sitting outside

9   waiting to come in to testify.

10       Q.   Do you have -- do you charge for your time?

11        A.   I do.

12       Q.   What do you charge for your time?

13       A.   When I'm sitting outside, it's $200 an hour,

14   you know, anything outside reviewing medical records,

15   deposition work. And then for testimony, it's $500 an

16   hour, of which half goes back to a foundation I have

17   created.

18       Q.   What foundation have you created?

19            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

20       Relevance. Unfair prejudice.

21             THE COURT: Overruled.

22            THE WITNESS: The foundation is for community

23       tobacco control at MUSC. I have a similar one set

24       up at Roswell. So half of my testimony fees go

25       back to those foundations, and then those dollars 2465

2   BY MR. UITERWYK:

3       Q.   Now, the jury has heard a little bit about

4   the Engle case. Did you testify in the Engle case?

5       A.   Yes.

6            MR. WALKER: Objection. Relevance.

7            THE COURT: Sustained.

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   What percentage of your time, Dr. Cummings,

10   is spent being involved in cases like this versus doing

11    all the research and writing and teaching and -- that

12   we just talked about in your resume?

13       A.   Well, I have done a lot more trials recently,

14   but I try to balance it so 80 percent of my time is

15   spent, you know, doing my research and teaching. And I

16   have 20 percent to do whatever I want. And I have

17   chosen to come in to the courtroom and do -- to share

18   what I know. And so it's about 80 percent doing the

19   teaching and research and about 20 percent here.

20       Q.   Slide 16 A.

21             Now, let's talk about cigarette addiction,

22   smoking, cause of disease, manipulation, and so forth.

23            How many deaths per year does cigarette

24   smoking cause in this country alone?

25       A.   Over 440,000 deaths. 2466

1        Q.   And in the 50 --1 think you talked about the

2   50-year cover-up from 1950. What time period does the

3    1950 - strike that.

4            What time period does the 50-year cover-up

5   that you talked about span?

6       A.   Basically, it started in 1953, and it -- that

7   cover-up goes through about 2000.

8       Q.   All right. And how many people died from

9   smoking cigarettes manufactured by the cigarette

10   companies in this country during that 50-year period,

11    during that 50-year cover-up?

12       A.   It's approximately 15 million. Actually, if

13   you add in the last decade, you would add another 5

14   million or so.

15       Q.   Tell me, how often does a person die from

16   cigarette smoking?

17       A.   You know, we have 365 days a year, so you're

18   talking, what, 1200 or so deaths every day from

19   smoking.

20       Q.   And do more people die from cigarette smoke

21    than AIDS, suicide?

22            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

23       Relevance, argumentative.

24            THE COURT: Sustained.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 2467

1        Q.   All right. How does cigarette -- how does

2   death of cigarette smoking, addicted to cigarettes

3   containing nicotine, compare? What level is it as far

4   as the amount causing death as to any other cause?

5            MR. WALKER: Same objection, Judge.

6            THE COURT: Sustained.

7   BY MR. UITERWYK:

8       Q.   All right. I will go on.

9            How many people in this country can you

10   estimate suffer from smoking-related diseases in any

11    given year?

12       A.   It's about 4 to 5 million people. You take

13   the number of deaths, multiply it by ten, based on the

14   studies that we've done, that are living with a serious

15   illness, mainly COPD as a result of smoking. COPD,

16   heart disease, and cancer were the three categories

17   that we looked at. So it's about ten times the number

18   of deaths.

19       Q.   All right. And in your opinion, Doctor, what

20   part did the cigarette companies play in the cause of

21    those deaths?

22       A.   Well, they engineer a product that got people

23   hooked on the cigarettes so they would have repeated

24   exposures that directly caused those diseases, and they

25   lied to the American public about what they knew about 2468

1   the health risk of smoking, and then their promise to

2   fix the product if it were anything -- if anything were

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=51
3   ever found. And as a result, that affected people's

4   decision making. They came out with little gimmicks

5   like filters and low tar as a way of, you know --

6            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, to the

7       characterization. Move to strike.

8            THE COURT: Overruled.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Go ahead, Doctor.

11        A.   They came out with filtered and low tar

12   cigarettes as a way to keep people who were health

13   concerned continuing -- but addicted, to continue to

14   use the product rather than to quit. And those were

15   choices that they made.

16       Q.   All right. Have you -- are you familiar with

17   the relative risk or -- strike that.

18            See, as you well know, Jackie Loyd developed

19   COPD in this case, correct?

20            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Leading.

21             THE COURT: Sustained.

22   BY MR. UITERWYK:

23       Q.   All right. One of the diseases that we're

24   going to talk about in this case is COPD. Based on

25   your knowledge of this industry and based on the 2469

1    epidemiological point of view, what percentage of the

2   people who develop COPD are smokers?

3       A.   About 95 percent.

4       Q.   And what --

5       A.   Ninety to 95 percent of COPD is caused by

6   smoking.

7       Q.   How about lung cancer?

8       A.   Similar.

9            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. May we

10       approach?

11             THE COURT: Okay.

12            (At the bench)

13            MR. WALKER: Judge, this witness is not a

14       medical doctor. I'm not even sure he's disclosed

15       to give this generic opinion testimony about these

16       illnesses. But even if he is, it's cumulative to

17       the testimony that the jury has already heard from

18       Dr. Mannino and from Dr. Villa.

19            MR. UITERWYK: I don't think anybody has

20       testified about the percentage of people who

21        develop COPD from smoking. I don't think anybody

22       has talked about that.

23            THE COURT: Objection is overruled.

24            (In open court)

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 2470

1        Q.   We've talked about COPD. How about lung

2   cancer?

3       A.   Lung cancer is about -- depending on, you

4   know, how long somebody smokes, about 85 to 90 percent

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=52
5   of lung cancers are directly attributable to active

6   smoking, and another portion of those are actually

7   attributed to second-hand smoking.

8       Q.   All right. Let's talk about actual smoking.

9   Let's assume somebody smoked for 40 years. What's the

10   percentage of the persons, based on your research and

11    study, that have developed lung cancer related to

12   smoking?

13       A.   Well, 40 years at a pack a day would be an

14   extraordinarily high risk. We're talking about a 20

15   fold, anywhere from 15 to 20 fold based on the

16   estimates that I think are due out tomorrow in the New

17   England Journal of Medicine.

18       Q.   When you say relative risk, can you explain

19   to the jury what you mean?

20       A.   Well, relative risk looks at the incidence or

21    the rate of disease in a group that does not have an

22   exposure to the rate of the disease in people -- in a

23   person that has the exposure and different levels of

24   exposure. You said 40 years of smoking a pack a day.

25   So that relative risk means that the rate of disease 2471

1    and the exposure of the smoking group would be anywhere

2   from 15 to 20 times greater than the rate in the group

3   that never smoked.

4       Q.   Now, what about the -- when a person develops

5   COPD and then also develops lung cancer, what happens

6   to the relative risk in that situation?

7       A.   Well, it's very common to see somebody who

8   has COPD going on to develop lung cancer independent,

9   actually, of how much they smoke and so on. You find

10   about a four- to five-fold increased risk.

11        Q.   What does that mean?

12       A.   That means that, you know, when you look at

13   somebody with the likelihood of developing lung cancer,

14   that rate of disease, if you've got somebody who has

15   diagnosed emphysema, they would be about four to five

16   times more likely to develop lung cancer than, say,

17   somebody who had smoked the same amount of time but

18   didn't have the diagnosis of emphysema. And that's

19   all -- so that's what that means.

20       Q.   All right. Now, I want to ask you a

21    question, Doctor. Based on your experience, education,

22   training and research and being in this field, whether

23   or not Ms. Loyd was addicted cigarettes containing

24   nicotine during her lifetime, up to -- at least up to

25   '95. 2472

1        A.   Based on my assessment of her smoking history

2   from all the materials that I reviewed, I did conclude

3   that she was addicted to the nicotine in the cigarettes

4   that she smoked and was, you know, highly addicted. I

5   scored her a 5 out of 6 on one of the scales that I

6   rely on, heaviness of smoking.

7       Q.   We'll talk about that in a minute.

8            Do you have an opinion within a reasonable

9   degree of certainty, more likely than not, as to

10   whether or not her addiction to cigarettes containing

11    nicotine played a part in -- a substantial part in the

12   development of her COPD, lung cancer and led to her

13   death?

14            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. He's not

15       disclosed to give that opinion.

16            THE COURT: Approach, please.

17            (At the bench)

18            MR. WALKER: This witness is not disclosed to

19       opine that she even had COPD, and he built COPD

20       into the question. So if he's not disclosed to

21        say that she had COPD, he can't give an opinion

22       that addiction caused her COPD. That's an issue

23       in this case that he's not disclosed to talk about

24       and he's not qualified to talk about.

25            THE COURT: It was a different -- that's a 2473

1        different objection.

2            MR. WALKER: That's the one I need to make,

3       that he --

4            THE COURT: Well, no. I mean, you said it

5       wasn't disclosed, and then you added "and he's not

6       qualified."

7            MR. WALKER: Well, if --

8            THE COURT: He could be disclosed and still

9       could not be qualified or couldn't be disclosed

10       and he could be qualified.

11             MR. WALKER: That's all true, Judge. But my

12       primary objection is it's not disclosed.

13            THE COURT: What is --

14            MR. UITERWYK: I would have to get it, Judge.

15            THE COURT: Get it.

16            MR. PEDROSA: When we argued that, I believe

17       that it was actually -- it was argued back when we

18       argued the motion on his qualifications back in

19       December. What the plaintiffs said were he's not

20       going to offer an opinion on a medical causation.

21             THE COURT: We'll do this at the break. Go

22       to another topic.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

24            THE COURT: At the break we'll look at the

25       disclosure and come back to it, depending upon 2474

1        the --

2            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

3            (In open court)

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   And on the issue of addiction, addiction to

6   cigarettes containing nicotine that you told us about,

7   have you had enough information, even though she's not

8   here with us anymore?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=54
9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   Now, did you prepare a slide --

11            Well, let me first go to slide -- slide 17 A,

12   please.

13            Now, did you assist in preparing this slide,

14   Signs and symptoms of Jacqueline Loyd's addiction to

15   cigarettes containing nicotine?

16       A.   That's correct.

17       Q.   And that's based on your review of the

18   information in this case?

19       A.   Correct.

20       Q.   All right. And tell us -- go through that

21    slide, if you could, and tell us how that, in your

22   opinion, that supports your opinion that Jackie Loyd

23   was addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine.

24       A.   Sure. I looked at --

25            MR. PEDROSA: Objection, Your Honor. Calls 2475

1        for a narrative. And I may have individual

2       objections to parts, parts of the answer.

3            THE COURT: All right. Overruled.

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   Go ahead.

6       A.   I looked for certain criteria: Persistent

7   daily use; amount smoked; time to first cigarette; age

8   of initiation, because the earlier someone smokes, the

9   more likely you're going to have, you know, structural

10   changes in the brain related to the exposure to the

11    drug; difficulty controlling your smoking; any evidence

12   of withdrawal and bouts of abstinence and how those

13   went, whether they were short or sustained; and use of

14   the product.

15            So these are just call-outs of some of the

16   observations. Clearly, she was a persistent daily

17   user. She smoked heavily, anywhere from one to two

18   packs per day. And there was variation in the reports

19   from family members and also in some of the medical

20   records. But they were all pretty consistent in saying

21    she smoked, you know, about a pack or more and for a

22   long time, 42 years. There were -- there was evidence

23   that she started smoking in the early fifties, around

24   age 16.

25       Q.   Why is that significant as it relates to 2476

1    addiction, the earlier that they smoke?

2       A.   Well, the studies, the epidemiologic studies

3   of humans that we've done show the earlier somebody

4   starts smoking and starts smoking on a persistent daily

5   basis, the more likely that they're going to smoke

6   heavily, struggle to quit, and have other signs and

7   symptoms of nicotine addiction.

8            And the animal studies that have been done

9   with younger animals versus older ones where they

10   expose them to nicotine, it actually shows us that they

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=55
11    have more changes in the brain, because the brain is

12   still developing when you're young, and the exposure --

13   the early exposure to the drug essentially is rewiring

14   the brain.

15            So people tend to need the drug rather than

16   just use it for pleasure. And as a result, it's

17   related to nicotine addiction. So the earlier age of

18   initiation tends to be a hallmark indicator of

19   addiction to a drug. It's not just for nicotine. It's

20   true of other drugs as well.

21        Q.   All right. We talked about got up in the

22   middle of the night to smoke a cigarette. Why is that

23   of any significance, Dr. Cummings?

24       A.   Well, people go a period -- nicotine doesn't

25   last very long in your system. It has a half-life of 2477

1    about two hours in your system. So the dose of

2   nicotine that you have when you puff on a cigarette and

3   you finish it, it's actually leaving your system fairly

4   rapidly.

5            And so, you know, addicted smokers will, if

6   they need the drug, will also smoke right away when

7   they wake up. So the signs that we look for, smoking

8   first thing in the morning and people who are, you

9   know, often very heavily addicted or maybe have other

10   problems like sleeplessness or whatever, but they're

11    reaching for a cigarette when they get up in the middle

12   of the night. And I have both of those in the reports

13   regarding Jacqueline Loyd.

14       Q.   The smoking, waking up first thing in the

15   morning you're referring to?

16       A.   Both that and waking up in the middle of the

17   night and having a cigarette. The same thing. You've

18   gone an extended period of time, you've got to

19   replenish the nicotine, so you're actually looking for

20   the drug. It's not just a habit; it's a physiological

21    need. And you can measure this in terms of

22   blood/nicotine levels.

23       Q.   When you say it's a physiological need, what

24   do you mean?

25       A.   Talking about the drug changes and the 2478

1    structure and function of the body. As we talked

2   about, the brain rewiring. And you basically don't

3   feel normal unless you have the drug. And that was

4   true of, you know, many addicted smokers, certainly

5   true in my observations of Jacqueline Loyd.

6       Q.   You mentioned that there was some variation

7   in the records to whether she smoked one pack or two

8   packs or a pack and a half or things of that nature.

9            Based on your having reviewed a number of

10   smokers, or particularly those that no longer are with

11    us, is that a surprise, that you're going to have a

12   variation, based on your training and experience, in

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=56
13   the history when you talk about a 40-year period?

14            MR. WALKER: Objection. Relevance.

15            THE COURT: Overruled.

16            THE WITNESS: No, it's not a surprise at all.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   Is there any evidence in this case that

19   somebody was walking behind her checking everything she

20   was doing, every brand that she was smoking, how much

21    she was smoking, when she was smoking or anything like

22   that?

23            MR. WALKER: Objection, argumentative.

24            THE COURT: Sustained.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 2479

1        Q.   When you review cases like this, do you

2   expect that they're going -- that the evidence you're

3   going to have is going to have some inconsistencies?

4       A.   It's my experience reviewing, you know,

5   medical records and testimony from family members and

6   so on, it's very common you'll get some discrepancies.

7   You'll look for a general pattern of consistency.

8   Everybody knew she smoked. Everybody said she smoked a

9   long time. And the amount smoked actually was fairly

10   consistent, in my opinion, based on my review of the

11    records.

12       Q.   And how about brand usage? Does that

13   fluctuate in cases like this, where you have some

14   inconsistencies as to what people remember over a

15   40-year period as to what a relative of theirs smoked?

16       A.   Yes, absolutely.

17       Q.   All right. Now, we'll get -- let me strike

18   that and go on.

19            In order to prepare this slide, did you look

20   at the overall information that you were provided?

21        A.   I relied on the medical records, the

22   deposition testimony from family members, and also

23   the -- there were worksheets and so on that were filled

24   out by family members as well.

25       Q.   Let's look at the brand usage. 2480

1            Now, she started smoking in 1951, correct?

2       A.   Correct.

3       Q.   Now, do we have information that she

4   basically smoked nonfiltered cigarettes in the period

5   between '51 and '54?

6       A.   Yes.

7            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.

8            THE COURT: Overruled.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Beg your pardon?

11             THE COURT: Overruled.

12            MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry. I was asking - I

13       didn't ask you, Judge. I was asking Dr. Cummings.

15       Q.   Beg your pardon?

16       A.   There is information she was smoking

17   nonfiltered cigarettes during that period before 1954.

18       Q.   Okay. And did you then actually, based on

19   your review of the information, determine that

20   approximately between the time frame of 1954 to 1991

21    that her primary brand was Winston?

22       A.   Yeah. Her primary brand during her life was

23   primarily Winston. She then went to Kent and True a

24   little bit later as a way of cutting back on her

25   smoking. 2481

1        Q.   All right. Now, Winston cigarettes are

2   manufactured by whom?

3       A.   R.J.Reynolds.

4       Q.   And the slide there talks about 1954. When

5   did Winston filtered cigarettes come out?

6       A.   1954.

7       Q.   Same time that she started?

8       A.   Smoking Winston, yeah.

9       Q.   All right. Smoking Winston?

10       A.   Yeah.

11        Q.   Which -- she started smoking when?

12       A.   1951.

13       Q.   Now -- then, did you look at the evidence and

14   determine that some time in the eighties -- there is no

15   exact dates -- that she started smoking Kent?

16            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Leading.

17            THE COURT: Overruled.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   Go ahead.

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   And who manufactures Kent cigarettes?

22       A.   Lorillard.

23       Q.   And then in 1991 to '93, you reviewed the

24   evidence to determine whether she changed the brand --

25   not brand -- yeah, changed her brand, Lorillard brand? 2482

1        A.   Yeah.

2       Q.   Brands?

3       A.   Yeah. There was some testimony that

4   different types of Kents -- Kents and Kent 3s 

5   Kent 3s is an ultra low tar and nicotine cigarette, and

6   then later there was some testimony about her switching

7   to True cigarettes.

8       Q.   All right. You said three different brands

9   of the Lorillard. Kent, was that a low tar, low

10   nicotine advertised brand?

11        A.   Yeah. It was generally marketed as a health

12   cigarette.

13       Q.   And when you say marketed as a health

14   cigarette, what do you mean?

15       A.   They always made claims about, you know, the

16   filter mainly, the micronized filter. And so it

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=58
17   achieved a brand profile that people who were going to

18   that brand were people who tended to be moving to it

19   because they were concerned --

20       Q.   All right.

21        A.   -- about their health.

22       Q.   And we'll get into that more a little later.

23            Then you mentioned the brand Kent 3. What is

24   Kent 3?

25       A.   Well, it's a -- what I would call a line 2483

1    extension of Kent, so there were different versions of

2   Kents as there are many of the premium brands that are

3   out there. So Kent 3 was a product that Lorillard came

4   out with in the early eighties. I think maybe 1979

5   they first came out with it. But it was marketed as a

6   lower yield product, lower numbers for tar and

7   nicotine.

8       Q.   And the last one, what was your understanding

9   of the time frame of '91 to '93 when she was using

10   True?

11        A.   That's my understanding, that she had gone to

12   True cigarettes at that time, and True is also, you

13   know, one of those brands that's considered a lower tar

14   and nicotine brand. And the testimony was that she

15   switched --

16            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.

17       Time limit.

18            THE COURT: Lay the foundation, please, with

19       respect to his knowledge --

20            MR. UITERWYK: All right.

21             THE COURT: --of this information.

22   BY MR. UITERWYK:

23       Q.   In review of the records --or review of the

24   testimony in this case -- did you determine as to

25   whether or not she switched to True during the '91/'93 2484

1   time frame, during the period of time when she was

2   trying to quit?

3       A.   Yes.

4            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Leading and the

5       same objection.

6            THE COURT: Overruled.

7   BY MR. UITERWYK:

8       Q.   Go ahead.

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   All right. Now, and based on your knowledge

11    of this industry, your knowledge of use of cigarettes

12   by the people who were addicted to nicotine and

13   considering the time frames that she started with

14   Winston, the filtered cigarette, considering the time

15   frame that she started moving to Kent light tar and

16   nicotine, and then to the True, lighter tar and

17   nicotine, based on your receipt -- research and your

18   knowledge of smoking behavior that she switched from

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=59
19   filters when they came out in '54 and then switched in

20   the eighties to the lighter cigarettes, what, if

21    anything, does that tell you as an expert in this

22   field?

23            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. The

24       question calls for speculation and it calls for a

25       conclusion beyond the witness's expertise. 2485

1            THE COURT: Overruled.

2   BY MR. UITERWYK:

3       Q.   Go ahead.

4       A.   Tells me that she relied on the information

5   she was getting from the manufacturers that were

6   promoting filters as a way of addressing the emerging

7   evidence coming out on the health risks of smoking and

8   later the low tar, as many people switched as more

9   information became available, and then to --

10            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, may we approach on

11        this issue?

12            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, he interrupted the

13       witness's answer.

14            MR. WALKER: I need to be heard on this,

15       Judge, I'm sorry.

16            THE COURT: Okay. Please approach.

17            (At the bench)

18            MR. WALKER: Judge, I apologize for

19       interrupting the witness.

20            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

21             MR. WALKER: But there is no expert on what

22       was going on in Ms. Loyd's head. This opinion

23       that he's giving cannot be given by anyone. Why

24       she switched is not something that he or anyone

25       else is qualified to give an opinion about, what 2486

1        was going on in her mind.

2            THE COURT: Okay.

3            MR. UITERWYK: He can talk very much about

4       what people were doing during these time frames,

5       in '54 and during the eighties, as it relates to

6       the filtered cigarettes and how people reacted to

7       the health care in 1954 and switched to filtered

8       cigarettes and how people -- let me finish -- and

9       how people switched to the lighter cigarettes when

10       they started to falsely advertise light cigarettes

11        as being light cigarettes -- and that was the

12       manipulation of the product, and he will testify

13       about that later -- and how she was one of those,

14       and particularly her smoking pattern was one of a

15       person who did exactly -- in '54, when filters

16       came out, Winston began selling filtered

17       cigarettes; when later on in the eighties when the

18       lights came out. As a result people were

19       switching like crazy, because they were relying on

20       the information that was provided to them.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=60
21             MR. WALKER: He went beyond that and said

22       that she relied -- he cannot give that testimony.

23            THE COURT: You need to lay a better

24       predicate in terms of what he's relying upon, and,

25       even if it's hearsay, whether or not experts in 2487

1        his field -- whether or not it's the type of

2       information that other experts and he himself

3       relies upon in reaching his opinions in

4       everyday -- in his everyday life as an

5       epidemiologist.

6            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

7            THE COURT: You haven't done that. And also,

8       whether or not he studied smoking patterns with

9       respect to people who switch to filtered

10       cigarettes in order to lay a foundation of whether

11        or not he has an opinion as to what Ms. Loyd did

12       and why she did it.

13            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

14            THE COURT: You haven't laid those. You have

15       the various dots, but you haven't connected them

16       yet.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

18            MR. WALKER: I move to strike, Your Honor --

19            MR. PEDROSA: Yes.

20            MR. WALKER: -- and ask that the jury be

21        instructed to disregard that.

22            MR. PEDROSA: He didn't testify that what she

23       did was consistent with other smokers. He

24       testified that she personally relied. And I join

25       in moving to strike that. He can't say that. 2488

1            MR. UITERWYK: Relying, I believe, is what he

2       testified to, and the --

3            THE COURT: I will sustain the objection,

4       strike the answer, and then you can lay

5       a predicate.

6            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Your Honor--hold

7       on -- the problem with striking the answer, I

8       mean, all I'm going to do now is going to go back

9       and lay the predicate and I think he'll give the

10       opinion again.

11             So, I mean, you're striking it now in the

12       middle of his answer. We allowed -- they objected

13       to the question. It was overruled, and then he

14       goes and answers the question. And then they move

15       to strike it, and that gives an inference that

16       he's not allowed to give that opinion.

17            THE COURT: Well, then, you get it in front

18       of the jury a second time.

19            MR. PEDROSA: There is no predicate for

20       what --

21             THE COURT: There may be. I haven't heard it

22       yet. There may be in terms of what his answer is

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=61
23       going to be based upon his knowledge, skill,

24       training, experience in being in this industry for

25       40 years. It may be that you can argue that he 2489

1        can't -- nobody can predict that. But I haven't

2       heard the foundation yet.

3            But you need to lay the foundation with

4       respect to, like I said, whether or not it's the

5       information that experts in his field reasonably

6       rely upon, just like medical doctors can rely upon

7       hearsay, because that's what they do in their

8       everyday practice. Something is written in the

9       record that says BAC, which is not the BAC we're

10       dealing with, blood alcohol content, is --

11             MR. WALKER: Oh.

12            THE COURT: -- .08, you know, that may be

13       hearsay, but it's a type of hearsay that they

14       reasonably rely upon in making a diagnosis every

15       day, and ordinarily that's admissible.

16            MR. WALKER: If I may, Judge, this witness's

17       field is not -- he's not -- his field is not

18       determining whether individual smokers switched

19       brands for a particular reason.

20            THE COURT: Well, I understand that. But his

21        experience in running a smoking hotline or

22       cessation clinic may encompass that.

23            MR. WALKER: For quitting, but not for

24       switching brands.

25            THE COURT: Well, it may. 2490

1            MR. WALKER: Okay.

2            THE COURT: I don't know that.

3            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

4            THE COURT: Let's take a break while we're on

5       this subject.

6            MR. WALKER: Okay. Yes, Your Honor.

7            (In open court)

8            THE COURT: All right. Members of the jury,

9       we're going to take a brief afternoon break at

10       this point. We'll be in recess for 15 minutes on

11        the courtroom clock. Please don't discuss this

12       case. Thank you.

13            (The jury retired from the courtroom at

14       3:22 p.m.)

15            THE COURT: All right. We will be in recess

16       for 15 minutes.

17            (A recess was taken at 3:22 p.m.)

18            (Court called to order at 3:34 p.m.)

19            THE COURT: Well, you might get a few more

20       objections sustained --

21             MR. PEDROSA: Defense is ready.

22            THE COURT: -- if plaintiff s counsel doesn't

23       show.

24            MS. HUMPHRIES: Yeah, I won't even pretend to

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=62
25       question. 2491

1            MR. SEIDEN: It's a pro se case now, Judge.

2            MS. HUMPHRIES: I will be right back, Your

3       Honor.

4            THE COURT: Okay.

5            (A pause in the proceedings during which

6       plaintiffs counsel entered the courtroom.)

7            THE COURT: Ready?

8            MR. WALKER: Yes, Judge. I wanted to remind

9       you that you granted the motion to strike. I know

10       we didn't deal with it before the break, but --

11             THE COURT: Do you still stand on that?

12            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

13            THE COURT: Okay. All right. Bring the jury

14       in, please.

15            (The jury returned to the courtroom at

16       3:37 p.m.)

17            THE COURT: Thank you. You may be seated.

18            With respect to the witness -- with respect

19       to the last question and answer, I have granted

20       the defendants' motion to strike and you're to

21        disregard the question and answer.

22            You may proceed.

23            MR. UITERWYK: May it please the Court.

24            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 2492

1        Q.   We were talking about filter cigarettes

2   before the break, as well as light cigarettes. Do you

3   recall that, Dr. Cummings?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   And did filter cigarettes at some point in

6   time contain indications of a level of nicotine and tar

7   on the package?

8       A.   Yes.

9       Q.   What is tar?

10       A.   Tar is the burning by-product of tobacco and

11   paper.

12       Q.   All right. What ultimately leads to the

13   diseases like lung cancer? What part of the cigarette?

14       A.   Primarily the tar. There are also gases that

15   contain, you know, harmful chemicals, about a thousand

16   chemicals in every puff of the cigarette.

17       Q.   We'll get to that a little bit more later.

18            And did the cigarette companies, in

19   particular Winston, Reynolds, when they first came out,

20   did they promote their filtered cigarettes as being

21    different than the nonfilter?

22            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

23            THE COURT: Overruled.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   Go ahead. 2493

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   And did they advertise, market, that the

3   filtered cigarettes basically would be safer than a

4   nonfilter?

5            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

6            THE COURT: Overruled.

7            THE WITNESS: Yes, they did. They basically

8       said you've got a filter blend and snowy white

9       filter, and Winston tastes good like a cigarette

10       should. So the notion that you'd get good taste

11        of a cigarette in a filtered cigarette.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   And based on your study of the --1 believe

14   you did an article, actually, on the issue of how

15   cigarette smokers reacted to advertising, did you not?

16       A.   Several.

17       Q.   And tell -- in that study, did you view or

18   did you research how the marketing done, for instance,

19   by filtered cigarettes or light cigarettes affected the

20   behavior of their customer?

21        A.   Yes. I have looked at the -- very

22   specifically on the perceptions of smokers with regards

23   to things like filtered cigarettes.

24       Q.   And did you also study how they relied on

25   this marketing? 2494

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   And the representations that were being made?

3       A.   I have.

4            MR. WALKER: Objection. Argumentative.

5            THE COURT: Overruled.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Beg your pardon?

8       A.   I have.

9       Q.   All right. And based -- and do you

10   frequently rely --do you rely on that information in

11    connection with your opinions in cases like this?

12       A.   I certainly rely on my research, yes.

13       Q.   And in connection with that reliance, do you

14   have an opinion within a reasonable degree of certainty

15   as to whether or not Jackie Loyd relied on those

16   commercials, advertising, marketing, representations

17   made by Reynolds in connection with the marketing of

18   the Winston cigarettes?

19            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Lack of

20       foundation as to Ms. Loyd. Calls for speculation.

21             THE COURT: Overruled.

22   BY MR. UITERWYK:

23       Q.   Go ahead.

24       A.   Yes. That's why people select the brands

25   they smoke. 2495

1        Q.   All right.

2       A.   So she smoked Winston.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=64
3       Q.   Because she relied on them?

4       A.   On the --

5            MR. WALKER: Leading. Same objection and

6       leading.

7            THE COURT: Overruled.

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   Go ahead.

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.I didn't hear your answer because it was

12   objected to.

13       A.   Yes. She relied on the information that was

14   put out by R.J. Reynolds with regards to Winston brand

15   cigarettes. That's why people select the brands of

16   cigarettes they smoke. They're relying on the

17   information that's put out by the manufacturer on that

18   brand.

19       Q.   All right. And let's now go to Kent

20   cigarettes and True cigarettes manufactured by

21    Lorillard, which I believe you said are light

22   cigarettes.

23       A.   They were marketed as low tar. Yeah, low

24   tar, nicotine cigarettes.

25       Q.   All right. Well, first of all, was Winston a 2496

1   low tar and nicotine cigarette?

2       A.   No.

3       Q.   Was Kent or True a low tar and nicotine

4   cigarette?

5       A.   It was marketed as a lower tar and nicotine

6   cigarette, but it was not. It did not deliver less tar

7   and nicotine to the consumer.

8       Q.   Were they -- was Winston safer than a

9   filtered cigarette in your opinion?

10            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. May I

11        approach?

12            THE COURT: Okay.

13            MR. WALKER: Sorry.

14            THE COURT: Yes.

15            (At the bench).

16            MR. UITERWYK: I will withdraw the question

17       and ask it in his opinion.

18            THE COURT: Okay. Did you hear?

19            MR. WALKER: I didn't.

20            THE COURT: Okay.

21             MR. UITERWYK: I will withdraw the question

22       and ask in his opinion.

23            MR. WALKER: Well, it's going to be the same

24       objection.

25            Judge, we filed a motion, a Frye motion as it 2497

1        relates to this witness, and we raised a number of

2       issues. One of those issues was cigarette design.

3       And in the plaintiffs response they specifically

4       said that Dr. Cummings would not be testifying as

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=65
5       a scientist on cigarette design. He can't answer

6       that question about the relative safety of the

7       design of Winston cigarettes without testifying as

8       a scientist on cigarette design.

9            MR. UITERWYK: Well, he's very much going to

10       be testifying on cigarette design as a person who

11        has researched cigarette design. He's not going

12       to say that he's a scientist on cigarette design.

13       He's a scientist on smoking and cigarettes and the

14       design and engineering of cigarettes.

15            MR. WALKER: These are the plaintiffs

16       papers. And they specifically represented to Your

17       Honor in opposing our motion that he would not be

18       testifying as a scientist on cigarette design.

19       There is no other basis to give an opinion about

20       the safety of a particular brand of cigarettes

21        without testifying as a scientist.

22            MR. UITERWYK: First of all, they had to even

23       withdraw the light ads. They can no longer even

24       advertise as light cigarettes because they were

25       proved to be false. 2498

1            THE COURT: We're not talking about that.

2       We're talking about the relative safety of

3       filtered cigarettes versus unfiltered cigarettes.

4            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah. He testified at length

5       about all the studies and research that he has

6       done on filtered cigarettes.

7            MR. WALKER: We relied on the representation

8       that they would not be getting into this area.

9            MR. UITERWYK: Well, that's not true, because

10       you filed a motion in limine. There was a hearing

11        on it. I was not involved but Celene was. But

12       there was a hearing on it on December 10th.

13            THE COURT: Well, what's -- where was it that

14       you said --

15            MR. WALKER: This is the response.

16            THE COURT: Are you looking at -

17            MR. WALKER: I wish I had a hard copy, Your

18       Honor.

19            THE COURT: That's okay. Let's look at it.

20       What are you looking at?

21             MR. WALKER: I'm looking at the plaintiffs

22       response to our motion to preclude Dr. Cummings --

23            THE COURT: Was it a -

24            MR. WALKER: This was round 1.

25            THE COURT: -- written response --2499

1            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

2            THE COURT: --or verbal response?

3            MR. WALKER: This is a written response.

4       It's dated December 5th, 2012. It's signed by the

5       Brannock & Humphries firm, attorneys for

6       plaintiff.

7            MR. PEDROSA: What they did argue, Judge, is

8       that, as Mr. Walker pointed out, he's not going to

9       testify to science and design, but he may talk

10       about behaviors and design. And that's what the

11       battleground was.

12            THE COURT: Okay.

13            MR. PEDROSA: But it was clear -

14            THE COURT: Let's go to another area, so when

15       I look at these papers -- move on to another area.

16            MR. PEDROSA: I have them here with me.

17            THE COURT: No. I'm not going to take it up

18       now.

19            MR. PEDROSA: Okay.

20            THE COURT: Move on to another area.

21             (In open court)

22   BY MR. UITERWYK:

23       Q.   Based on your -- let's talk about light

24   cigarettes. Okay? Based on your research and study

25   regarding perception of -- of consumers of cigarettes 2500

1    and their reaction to the marketing of light cigarettes

2   during the time frames that we're referring to here, in

3   your opinion, did Jackie Loyd rely on the

4   representations made by Lorillard with regard to light

5   cigarettes as being healthier?

6            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Speculation. Lack

7       of predicate.

8            THE COURT: Sustained.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Let me ask it a different way. Did your

11    research -- has your research shown that the customers

12   of the cigarette manufacturers, particularly light

13   cigarette manufacturers, that there was a period of

14   time that they were relying on advertising and

15   switching to lights because of representations made by

16   the cigarette companies?

17       A.   Yes. I have done research on people's

18   switching brands, and specifically looking at the issue

19   of switching from regular cigarettes to those that were

20   lower in tar and nicotine and how that relates to the

21    marketing of different brands of low tar and nicotine

22   cigarettes, primarily in the period of the seventies,

23   eighties and nineties when the market shifted to people

24   smoking more of those products. And it was mostly from

25   switching from the regular brands to the ones that were 2501

1   marketed as lower tar brands.

2       Q.   And because that was their reaction to the

3   advertising?

4       A.   Yes.

5            MR. PEDROSA: Objection, leading.

6            THE COURT: Sustained.

7   BY MR. UITERWYK:

8       Q.   Why did they switch to lower brands, based on

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=67
9   your studies?

10            MR. PEDROSA: I'm sorry. Move to strike.

11             THE COURT: Overruled.

12            THE WITNESS: They switched because of the

13       marketing claims and the amount of marketing that

14       was going on. So when you actually divide how

15       much was being spent on brand advertising during

16       the period of the seventies and eighties, there is

17       an increasing shift, more money going into the

18       promoting the lower-yield products. And that

19       corresponded with, in general, when you track

20       public beliefs about the risk of smoking, which

21        was increasing over a time, the companies were

22       pushing their lower-yield product to address that

23       so people would keep smoking.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   And in your opinion, based on that research, 2502

1   was Jackie Loyd one of those?

2            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Speculation. Lack

3       of predicate.

4            THE COURT: Sustained.

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   All right. We'll go back -- we'll go

7   around -- come back to that after we discuss some other

8   issues. Okay?

9       A.   Okay.

10       Q.   Let's talk about the definition of addiction,

11    if we could.

12            Slide No. 17.

13            Before we get to that, hold onto that one,

14   Baron.

15            How do you define addiction? Let's go back

16   to the issue of addiction. How do you define it,

17   Dr. Cummings?

18       A.   Well, addiction to drugs --1 use the NIDA

19   definition, which is the modern definition of drugs.

20   And it has to do with the chronic use of a drug, so not

21    a one-time experimentation but repeated use. It's

22   characterized by relapse, which is a behavior of, you

23   know, using the drug, trying to abstain, going back to

24   it. It's a brain disease. Drugs cause changes in the

25   brain, structure and function of the body. So 2503

1    addiction is defined as a chronic relapsing brain

2   disease that is characterized by compulsive use. You

3   can follow the pattern of use, which is very typical

4   with smoking. Lighting up a cigarette every, you know,

5   40 to 60 minutes throughout the waking hours of the

6   day, smoking first thing in the morning, smoking around

7   certain associations that are very common with the --

8   with the drug despite harmful consequences.

9       Q.   All right. We'll go through that in a

10   minute. But that -- that which you have on the screen

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=68
11    is the NIDA definition of addiction?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   And in your opinion, does that addiction also

14   apply to nicotine, that definition also apply to

15   nicotine addiction?

16       A.   Yes. This is a general definition of

17   addiction, drug addiction, and it applies to nicotine.

18       Q.   Now, are you aware of any definition of

19   nicotine that requires, in order for someone to be

20   addicted, that they have to have compete and utter loss

21    of control over their smoking behavior?

22       A.   No. People quit addictions. The answer

23   would be no.

24       Q.   All right. Now, would Jackie Loyd meet this

25   definition of addiction, in your opinion? 2504

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   Within a reasonable degree of certainty, more

3   likely than not?

4       A.   That's my opinion.

5       Q.   All right. You've got here chronic relapsing

6   brain disease. How did Jackie Loyd fit into this part

7   of the definition of chronic relapsing brain disease?

8       A.   Well, chronic is long-term. Forty-two years

9   is a long time to be using a drug over and over and

10   over again.

11             Relapsing when she tried to abstain. And her

12   quitting behavior, based on my review of the evidence,

13   began in earnest in the early 1990s. And there were

14   multiple quit attempts, usually of short order, until

15   she finally was able to overcome her addiction. I

16   think it was in late 1993 when she finally quit for

17   good.

18            There was a compulsive drug seeking behavior.

19       Q.   That's what I was going to ask you next. The

20   next part of it is characterized by compulsive drug

21    seeking and use.

22       A.   Yeah. I mean, you know, you don't have to

23   go, you know, rob somebody to get cigarettes. I mean,

24   they sell them just about in every store. So --

25            But people are using cigarettes a lot. Every 2505

1   puff on a cigarette is a dose of nicotine. So you take

2   about ten shots on every cigarette, and when you do

3   that 20 or 40 times a day, that's, you know, a lot of

4   doses, 200 to 400 repetitions of drug delivery. That's

5   a chronic exposure that's compulsive, and that's often

6   associated with smokers like on a clock. It definitely

7   follows the physiological effects of nicotine, which,

8   as I say, has a short half-life. And people -- this is

9   where you get the individual variability. Some people

10   metabolize nicotine faster than others, and those who

11    are slow metabolizers tend to smoke less. They don't

12   need the nicotine as frequently. Those who tend to

13   smoke more, who smoke first thing when they get up in

14   the morning, who have to smoke a cigarette when they

15   wake up in the middle of the night, who have to leave a

16   restaurant to go out and light up a cigarette, those

17   are indications that somebody is, you know, drug

18   seeking for nicotine, and they're not just doing it,

19   you know, as a habit that they can walk away from

20   easily.

21        Q.   Does availability of a substance like

22   nicotine, which is in cigarettes, affect somebody's

23   ability, for whatever reason, to stop using the

24   substance?

25       A.   Sure. It makes a big difference. 2506

1        Q.   Explain that, please, quickly or briefly.

2       A.   Well, I mean, it's just common sense. That

3   if you know the drug is easily accessible, people are

4   more likely to use it. And if you -- you know, if the

5   drug is not easily available, you know, then people

6   will still seek the drugs if they're addicted to them.

7            And we've seen this with cigarettes. And

8   when they ran out of cigarettes when the Iron Curtain

9   fell in Russia, there were lines lined up to get

10   cigarettes instead of food.

11             So, you know, cigarettes are an addictive

12   drug. And they're widely available at a relatively low

13   cost, which is one of the reasons we have so many

14   smokers.

15       Q.   And you have here, use despite harmful

16   consequences. What does that mean?

17       A.   Well, it's continued -- nobody chooses to get

18   cancer, COPD.

19       Q.   Why would somebody use a substance known to

20   be harmful?

21        A.   Because they're addicted to it. My

22   experience with smokers is most smokers would quit if

23   they could.

24       Q.   Is there any other explanation?

25       A.   For the vast majority of people smoking, no. 2507

1        Q.   All right. When Jackie Loyd started at the

2   age of 16, based on your knowledge of what was going on

3   during this time frame in 1951, in your opinion, did

4   she appreciate that it could be harmful?

5            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Leading.

6       Argumentative.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Let me rephrase the question.

8            THE COURT: Sustained.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Was there information available during that

11    time frame where people could appreciate as to whether

12   or not smoking would harm them?

13       A.   Well, I mean, certainly there was -- you can

14   find examples of information. But the vast majority of

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=70
15   information that people were exposed to at the time

16   that she started smoking in the early 1950s was

17   information that promoted smoking. There were massive

18   amounts of advertising for cigarettes. You know, you

19   would see them on billboards. You'd see them in the

20   stores. It was on television, on the radio. There

21    were sports teams sponsored by cigarette companies.

22   There were celebrities smoking. It was everywhere. It

23   was part of the culture, basically. Half of all

24   doctors were smoking in the early fifties.

25            Yeah, there were early studies coming out, 2508

1    and some of those got picked up in publications. But

2   it's, you know, if you had to weigh the amount of

3   information out there, it's like an elephant on one

4   side of the scale and a grain of sand on the other. I

5   mean, it was overwhelmingly promoting smoking. It was

6   part of Americana. It is what people expected you to

7   do. It's what your friends expected you to do as a

8   rite of passage. And if you're a teenager, you're not

9   thinking about, you know, some medical article that

10   might have appeared.

11        Q.   And that's particularly my question. Based

12   on your research, did the teenagers during that time

13   frame in the 1950s, when they started smoking, based on

14   your research, were they aware of the harms or

15   appreciate the harms? Did they have sufficient

16   information to do that, or did they react to it?

17       A.   No.

18            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

19       Argumentative. Compound question.

20            THE COURT: It is compound.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Let me rephrase.

22            THE COURT: Ask it again.

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   Based on your research, did the teenagers in

25   that time frame, like Jackie Loyd, did they appreciate 2509

1   the harm?

2       A.   No, they didn't. People didn't appreciate

3   it. And studies conducted at that time indicate, when

4   you asked adult smokers whether there was a link

5   between smoking and cancer, based on the polls that I

6   have reviewed at that time period, less than one

7   percent would mention cancer. That was a 1953 survey

8   of over 10,000 Americans ages 15 and older.

9       Q.   And during that time frame, did the cigarette

10   manufacturers choose to design and engineer their

11    cigarettes to make it easier for the teenagers to start

12   smoking?

13            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading and

14       argumentative.

15            THE COURT: Overruled.

17       Q.   Go ahead.

18       A.   Yes, they did.

19       Q.   Tell the jury about that.

20       A.   Sure. Cigarettes have been blended for

21    mildness, so to make it easier to inhale the smoke into

22   your lungs. And that's done by the use of, you know,

23   the types of tobaccos that are used. The U.S. blend is

24   a combination of burley tobacco, which is typically air

25   cured, the flue cured Virginia tobaccos, which are heat 2510

1    cured, and then oriental or Turkish tobacco. And that

2   was the classic American blend.

3            And they were -- it was basically put

4   together using a combination typically of the flue

5   cured tobacco, which made it possible for people to

6   inhale the smoke, and inhalation of the smoke allows

7   the particles of tar which carry the nicotine to get

8   into the lungs. Your lungs are the surface area of the

9   tennis court. So a big surface area. That allows for

10   rapid absorption of nicotine into the blood and hitting

11    the brain in seven to ten seconds. If you only held

12   the smoke in your mouth, like a cigar smoker tends to

13   do, that's the surface area of basically a tennis ball,

14   so a lot less area to get absorbed into the lung. And

15   so cigars, if you've only smoked a cigar, tends not

16   to --

17            MR. WALKER: Objection, narrative.

18            THE COURT: Sustained.

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   All right. Let me -- we're going to be

21    talking in detail about design, are we not? And

22   engineering and manipulation?

23       A.   Sure. Yeah.

24       Q.   And did they also choose to design the

25   marketing to lure the teenagers in during this time 2511

1   frame?

2       A.   They did.

3       Q.   And earlier we talked about the 1988 Surgeon

4   General and the Surgeon General's report. In 1988, did

5   the Surgeon General conclude that cigarettes and other

6   forms of tobacco are addictive?

7            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading. Hearsay.

8            THE COURT: Overruled.

9            THE WITNESS: Yes. That was a topic of the

10       '88 report.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   All right. Let's go to slide 28.

13            And was that the Surgeon General at the time

14   in 1988?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   1988.

17       A.   1988, that's Dr. Koop.

18       Q.   All right. And was this particular Surgeon

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=72
19   General report about nicotine addiction under the

20   subtitle of The Health Consequences of Smoking?

21        A.   Correct. That was the topic of the report,

22   was on the behavior of smoking and why people smoke.

23   And you can see the three main conclusions that were

24   reached in that report based on the review of evidence.

25       Q.   And did he conclude at that time that 2512

1    cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   Nicotine is a drug in tobacco that causes

4   addiction?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   And that the pharmacological and behavior

7   process that determines tobacco addiction are similar

8   to those that determine addiction to drugs, such as

9   heroin and cocaine?

10       A.   Correct.

11        Q.   How is the behavorial or pharmacological and

12   behavorial process that determines addiction similar to

13   that for drugs such as heroin and cocaine?

14       A.   They were looking at the physiological -- or

15   the pharmacologic effects is looking at the effect of

16   the drug on the function and structure of the body,

17   specifically the brain and central nervous system.

18            So drugs like cocaine affect parts of the

19   brain that give us reward and cause the release of

20   certain chemicals in the brain, they call

21    neurotransmitters. And these neurotransmitters affect

22   the circuitry in the brain and how you feel --

23       Q.   Okay.

24       A.   -- essentially, Dopamine being one of the

25   main chemicals. That's the reward one. 2513

1        Q.   And we're going to get to that in detail a

2   little bit better when we show the jury about

3   neurotransmitters.

4            Let's -- are you familiar or have you

5   prepared a slide called The Key Criteria of Cigarette

6   Addiction, slide No. 20?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Would you get that, please, Baron?

9            Could you tell the jury what this is?

10       A.   These are the criteria that I use when I look

11    at somebody smoking's history to determine whether

12   they're addicted to nicotine in cigarettes. And these

13   were the criteria I used when I reviewed, you know,

14   Ms. Loyd's smoking behavior.

15       Q.   All right. Let's go to the next slide, 44,1

16   believe. I'm sorry. That's it. You've got it?

17            MR. PHILIPSON: Yes.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   All right. Now, is that using your criteria

20   and plugging in how it related to Jacqueline Loyd?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=73
21        A.   Correct.

22       Q.   We've gone over some of these already, have

23   we not?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   Persistent daily use, 40 years. For time of 2514

1   first cigarette, first thing in the morning. Amount

2   smoked in day, one to two packs.

3            And then we've also talked about some of the

4   secondary criteria, have we not?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   And that's early age of initiation. We

7   talked about that. Began as a teacher -- a teenager in

8   '51.

9            And then we've got the difficulty refraining

10   from smoking, many instances.

11             Can you tell the jury about that?

12       A.   Sure. I mean, there were reports. Again,

13   most recall, I think, in the early 1990s that she was

14   trying to quit smoking. And there is a variety of

15   methods that were tried, including the mention of using

16   the nicotine patch, which is a drug prescribed at that

17   time. Now you can buy it over the counter, but it was

18   a prescription. And it's intended for treating

19   nicotine dependence. So that's sort of an indication

20   of a diagnosis of nicotine dependence.

21             There were reports of her switching brands.

22   One of the most common methods that people used to try

23   to quit smoking is to switch to lower yield brands.

24   It's not an effective method, because you don't get

25   less nicotine in a low yield brand. 2515

1            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Narrative.

2       Nonresponsive. Move to strike.

3            THE COURT: Sustained.

4            MR. UITERWYK: Sure, it's responsive, Your

5       Honor.

6            THE COURT: Well, it's not responsive to the

7       secondary criteria.

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   We were talking about the difficulty

10   refraining from the smoking, were we not, Doctor?

11        A.   That's right.

12       Q.   All right. And you were explaining how she

13   fit in that criteria, correct?

14       A.   Right.

15       Q.   And how did her switching to light

16   cigarettes -- what did that indicate regarding

17   difficulty refraining from smoking?

18       A.   Well, I looked for evidence in the material

19   that I reviewed. I was talking about some of that

20   evidence just a second ago that fit that criteria.

21    There were some others. She found it hard to go, you

22   know, even a couple of hours without having a

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=74
23   cigarette. That was something I found.

24            There was a mention actually by a couple of

25   her family members that is mentioned that when she 2516

1   would go out to a restaurant, she would have to get up

2   from the restaurant because they didn't allow smoking,

3   to go out and have a cigarette. So that's another

4   indication.

5            There were frequent efforts. I think her

6   husband, Ellis, talked about her making multiple quit

7   attempts. I think he estimated something like seven to

8   ten that he recalled, which failed. So this was the

9   quit-and-relapse pattern that's common until she

10   finally quit for good.

11        Q.   And you also have withdrawal symptoms and

12   craving upon -- cravings upon quitting. How did she

13   fit in that particular category?

14       A.   Well, again, I looked in the testimony that I

15   reviewed for any evidence from family members who

16   observed what happened to her behavior when she tried

17   to abstain from smoking and what they said about it.

18   And the things that I recorded were things like feeling

19   irritable, agitated, short tempered, anxious, grouchy.

20   She had problems sleeping. She needed to have a

21    cigarette. Craving for a cigarette.

22            These were all consistent with the

23   characteristic withdrawal symptoms that come along with

24   nicotine addiction. You don't see that in somebody who

25   is not addicted to nicotine when they abstain. 2517

1        Q.   And then the final one, use despite knowledge

2   of harms or actual harm. How did she fit into that

3   category?

4       A.   Well, in two regards. I think one of her

5   family members, you know, volunteered that she would

6   try to cut down when she was ill or sick, but she

7   didn't quit altogether. So continued use despite harm.

8            And then, of course, in this period from 1991

9   until late 1993, with the quit attempts going on, she

10   smoked during that period, and clearly had some

11    advancing health problems as a result of the medical

12   condition that she had.

13       Q.   All right. And as a result of her meeting

14   all these criteria, did that support your opinion that

15   Jackie Loyd was addicted to cigarettes containing

16   nicotine?

17       A.   Yes. She met all these criteria.

18       Q.   All right. And we talked -- you talked a

19   minute ago about withdrawal symptoms. If we could have

20   a slide for a minute and we'll go over that for a

21    second.

22            And did she have withdrawal symptoms before

23   she quit, when she was trying to quit, and then after

24   she quit?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=75
25       A.   Yeah. 2518

1        Q.   For a period of time?

2       A.   Yeah. I think even well after she quit

3   smoking for good, she I think told one of her daughters

4   she still feels like she needs a cigarette every now

5   and then.

6       Q.   And are these withdrawal symptoms, irritable,

7   agitated -- that she had -- quick tempered, got upset,

8   tense, anxious, always needed to have something in her

9   mouth, had to constantly look for things to keep her

10   occupied, weight gain, insomnia, cravings, are these

11    typical of persons who are addicted?

12       A.   Yes. These are, you know -- you know, the

13   words are the words of the family members as they

14   recalled her behavior. But they are pretty consistent

15   with the checklist that we use in assessing withdrawal

16   symptoms in people when they try to abstain from

17   smoking.

18       Q.   Now, I will talk about some other definitions

19   of addiction briefly and how Jackie Loyd fit into those

20   definitions.

21             Let's go to slide No. 40, please.

22            And what -- what definition or criteria is

23   this that we're looking at on the screen now?

24       A.   Well, again, this is a general criteria for

25   drug dependence. And it was described in the '88 2519

1    Surgeon General's report. So it's not specific

2   necessarily to nicotine, but it's just generally in

3   terms of drug addiction. And, you know, obviously, you

4   know, smoking -- cigarette smoking addiction fits into

5   that criteria.

6       Q.   And this is a criteria set forth by the

7   Surgeon General in the 1988 Surgeon General's report?

8       A.   Yes.

9            MR. UITERWYK: That's been marked as PT-983.

10       And we're going to offer that into evidence in

11        connection with the witness's testimony, Your

12       Honor.

13            THE COURT: You're moving it into evidence?

14            MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

15            THE COURT: Any objections other than the

16       ones already stated?

17            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor.

18            THE COURT: All right. It will be received.

19            (Exhibit PT-983 received.)

20            THE CLERK: Can you repeat the number again,

21       please?

22            MR. UITERWYK: PT-983.

23            THE CLERK: Thank you.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   All right. Now, the first one is primary 2520

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=76
1    criteria. They have the same primary and secondary

2   criteria, the same as yours, but they're somewhat

3   different, aren't they?

4       A.   Well, they're all pretty much the same.

5   They're all really getting at that general definition

6   of drug addiction that NIDA uses today. I think we

7   know a lot more about the brain effects than we did,

8   you know, back in 1988. But they're all pretty much

9   the same. Highly controlled, compulsive use. Talking

10   about the effects on your mood and also --

11        Q.   Is that what explains the withdrawal symptoms

12   when you do quit?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   And you say -- go on.

15       A.   So it's drug reenforced. So, you know, you

16   don't see these, this stereotypic pattern without the

17   drug reenforcer. In this case, it's nicotine. If

18   you're looking at other drugs, heroin, opiates or the

19   cocaine.

20       Q.   Let me stop you there, Dr. Cummings. Did

21    Jackie Loyd meet the primary criteria -- criteria

22   that's established by the Surgeon General for drug

23   dependence?

24       A.   Sure. She definitely had, you know, evidence

25   of frequent dosing of the drug, highly controlled, 2521

1    compulsive use. Again, the hallmarks for cigarettes

2   are first thing in the morning or smoking in the middle

3   of the night and smoking pretty repetitively during the

4   day.

5            Psychoactive effects. Evidence of that is I

6   think there is even some testimony that she enjoyed

7   smoking. Well, you get pleasure --

8       Q.   Let's talk about that.

9       A.   -- from a drug.

10       Q.   Let's talk about that. When a smoker like --

11    addicted to cigarettes like Jackie Loyd makes a comment

12   that she likes cigarettes, will we see some evidence as

13   to -- will we see evidence of how, in fact, that's a

14   reaction to what the drug is doing on their brain?

15            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

16       Argumentative.

17            THE COURT: Sustained.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   What causes that reaction, Dr. Cummings, with

20   regard to cigarette smoking?

21             MR. PEDROSA: Objection.

22            THE COURT: I'm sorry?

23            MR. PEDROSA: I said objection, speculation.

24            THE COURT: Mr. Reporter, repeat the question

25       for me. 2522

1             (A portion of the record was read by the

2       reporter.)

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=77
3            THE COURT: That question is overruled.

4            THE WITNESS: It's the neurotransmitters that

5       are released in response to the exposure to

6       nicotine in the brain.

7   BY MR. UITERWYK:

8       Q.   Do the cigarette smokers actually like the

9   cigarette, or is it the brain telling them that they

10   like it?

11        A.   They get reward signals. It makes them feel

12   better. And so that's what the brain is telling them,

13   because they're getting the pleasure chemical,

14   Dopamine, released in the brain. And the absence of

15   that is not feeling good. And you call that

16   withdrawal. And this is why smokers get into this

17   vicious cycle.

18       Q.   You have additional criteria. You have

19   addictive behavior often involves stereotypic patterns

20   of use.

21            What does that mean, Dr. Cummings?

22       A.   Well, I mean, again, smoking with coffee I

23   think was one of the things that was mentioned by

24   family members, you know. So there is a, you know,

25   particular pattern that smokers have. The phone rings, 2523

1    somebody reaches for a cigarette. You know, smoking

2   frequently during the day around friends, with alcohol.

3   Those are all kinds of things that are often linked.

4       Q.   Did she have recurrent drug cravings?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   And let's go to dependence producing drugs

7   often produce tolerance.

8            What is tolerance as it relates to addiction

9   to cigarettes containing nicotine?

10       A.   Well, tolerance, as it relate to a drug, you

11   begin to need the drug to feel normal. In the absence

12   of having that drug, you feel not normal. And it

13   doesn't happen overnight. In fact, the initial

14   exposure usually to a drug is aversion, particularly to

15   cigarettes. But when your brain has been altered, you

16   need more of the drug to get the effect. And anybody

17   who is a persistent daily smoker for, you know, three

18   months or longer, persistent use, they've probably

19   developed a tolerance to the drug.

20            Which is why when the government does their

21    surveys, they usually ask, Have you smoked a hundred

22   cigarettes in your lifetime? Sort of an odd question.

23   But it actually separates out those who just experiment

24   and haven't sort of crossed over that tolerance

25   threshold, because it really distinguishes those who go 2524

1    on to become adult smokers and those who are just

2   experimenting and don't go on to become smokers.

3       Q.   Now, we talked about the pleasant, euphoric

4   fix, when you said that people say they like smoking,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=78
5   correct?

6       A.   Yeah. Well, they like it definitely because

7   of the reward. I mean, I don't think -- you know,

8   nobody is getting high from smoking cigarettes. But

9   there is a definite enjoyment. People often talk about

10   pleasure and satisfaction. It's often, you know,

11    included in advertising around the cigarettes, and it's

12   really a code term for the effect of nicotine on the

13   brain.

14       Q.   Does Jackie Loyd, in your opinion,

15   Dr. Cummings, meet the Surgeon General's criteria for

16   drug dependence?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   And is that the same criteria for nicotine

19   addiction?

20       A.   Yeah. They're talking about nicotine

21    addiction, yeah.

22       Q.   All right. Now, before we talk about some

23   other diagnoses of nicotine addiction, let's talk about

24   who are the front-line medical professionals and health

25   professionals that most commonly diagnose and treat 2525

1   people for nicotine addiction.

2       A.   Who are they? Usually your family doctor,

3   internal medicine. So it's primary care doctors are

4   the ones who see most of the smokers initially and

5   treat them for nicotine dependence, in my experience.

6       Q.   And based on your experience in having

7   treated thousands and thousands and thousands of people

8   who are addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine, do

9   you have any experience as to whether or not

10   psychiatrists are typically those that treat or

11    evaluate or diagnose nicotine addiction?

12            MR. WALKER: Objection. Relevance.

13            THE COURT: Overruled.

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   Go ahead.

16       A.   Well, typically, especially specialists like

17   psychiatrists, they're not the front line for treating

18   nicotine dependence, although they certainly do. But

19   their -- you know, it would be primary care doctors;

20   family doctors primarily, in my experience.

21        Q.   All right. Now, in this particular case, is

22   there evidence that Jackie Loyd's primary doctors

23   diagnosed her with nicotine addiction?

24       A.   Well, there is in the --1 interpreted it

25   that there was, because she was prescribed a drug for 2526

1   treating nicotine dependence, that is the nicotine

2   patch, which had just come out at the time that she was

3   using it. Literally, it just hit the market in

4   December of '92. And there was evidence that she was

5   using it in 1993.

6       Q.   Now, let's first talk about nicotine and how

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=79
7   it works, and then we'll talk about how the defendants

8   designed, engineered and manipulated the cigarette to

9   be a drug delivery device.

10            What is nicotine?

11        A.   It's an alkaloid.

12       Q.   Meaning?

13       A.   Well, an alkaloid is a, you know, basically a

14   chemical. It's mainly made of nitrogen.

15       Q.   And the jury -- does nicotine occur naturally

16   in the tobacco plant?

17       A.   It can. It doesn't have to. You can grow

18   tobacco plants without nicotine.

19       Q.   That's my question. Can cigarette companies

20   grow tobacco plants without nicotine?

21        A.   They can and have. They have had that

22   technology for many decades to grow tobacco with no

23   nicotine in it or any high levels of nicotine or any

24   level in between.

25       Q.   Let's talk about the control of the nicotine 2527

1   in the cigarette, in manufacturing. Do cigarette

2   companies have the capability to control and manipulate

3   the nicotine in cigarettes any way they want?

4            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. This

5       relates to the issue we discussed at side bar

6       earlier with respect to cigarette design.

7            THE COURT: Approach, please.

8            (At the bench)

9            THE COURT: Let me see the paper. Do you

10       have the document?

11             MR. PEDROSA: Oh, yes.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I will have

13       Ms. Humphries --

14            THE COURT: Yes.

15            MR. WALKER: Your Honor -

16            THE COURT: No, no, no. No, you can go over

17       there. I don't want more than one counsel at side

18       bar.

19            MR. UITERWYK: I will let her.

20            THE COURT: No. You're the lawyer on this

21        witness.

22            MR. UITERWYK: The reason I asked her to come

23       up here, Your Honor, because she argued the

24       hearing --

25            THE COURT: Well, I know. But I can read the 2528

1        transcript. What page is it on?

2            MR. PEDROSA: That's what I'm looking for.

3       Mr. Walker has the page.

4            MR. WALKER: Judge, I think it's page 4.

5       It's page 3. Sorry.

6            MR. PEDROSA: Three. No. I think this might

7       just be our motion.

8            MR. WALKER: The response.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=80
9            THE COURT: That's the response.

10            MR. PEDROSA: Yeah. I apologize. Let me

11        see.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, could I get my

13       copy of the document?

14            THE COURT: Yes.

15            (In open court)

16            THE COURT: Bailiff, take the jury out for a

17       few minutes, please.

18            You-all can return to your seats.

19            (The jury retired from the courtroom at

20       4:19 p.m.)

21             THE COURT: All right. Be seated, please.

22            The issue we're examining is whether or

23       not --

24            Dr. Cummings, would you wait outside, please?

25            THE WITNESS: Sure. 2529

1            THE COURT: Thank you.

2            (The witness exited the courtroom.)

3            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, this is the

4       response.

5            THE COURT: Just a minute. Just a minute.

6            The issue we're looking at is whether or not

7       Dr. Cummings has been withdrawn as an expert on

8       cigarette design. It's been represented by

9       Mr. Walker and/or Mr. Pedrosa that at a hearing

10       that plaintiffs counsel withdrew -- Ms. Humphries

11        withdrew Dr. Cummings on the issue of cigarette

12       design. And specifically the question posed to

13       Dr. Cummings was, Can cigarette manufacturers

14       manufacture and produce cigarettes containing

15       tobacco which does not have nicotine and whether

16       or not that's a design question.

17            So where is it that specifically addresses

18       Ms. Humphries' remarks and/or papers?

19            MR. PEDROSA: May I approach?

20            THE COURT: Yes.

21             MR. PEDROSA: This is the plaintiff s

22       response. The motion is what I gave you in the

23       binder, but that's really not what you're looking

24       for. What you're looking for is in the response.

25            THE COURT: Well, can you point to me 2530

1        where --

2            MR. PEDROSA: Yes.

3            THE COURT: -- you rely upon her papers that

4       they withdraw him on cigarette design?

5            MR. PEDROSA: The portion that Mr. Walker was

6       pointing to at side bar is under the heading

7       Cigarette Design that starts on page 3.

8            THE COURT: Okay.

9            MR. PEDROSA: And I have given you my copy,

10       so I will ask Mr. Walker to tell you what line

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=81
11        it's at.

12            MR. WALKER: It's page 3, Judge. I believe

13       it's the second sentence under the heading

14       Cigarette Design.

15            I actually just moved away. Sorry.

16            Yes, Your Honor. It's actually the second

17       sentence. The heading says Cigarette Design. And

18       it says--1 see that you have it.

19            MR. UITERWYK: Could I look over your

20       shoulder?

21             MR. WALKER: What's that?

22            MR. UITERWYK: Can I look over your shoulder?

23            MR. WALKER: Yes, of course.

24            MR. UITERWYK: Thank you.

25            THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk, when Dr. Cummings 2531

1        is testifying regarding the manufacture of

2       cigarettes with tobacco that does not have

3       nicotine in it, does that qualify -- does that

4       fall into the category of cigarette design?

5            MR. UITERWYK: Actually, the question was,

6       Your Honor -- what brought the objection was, do

7       they have the ability to manipulate the nicotine

8       as it relates to the level of nicotine in the

9       cigarettes during the manufacturing process.

10            THE COURT: Okay. That question, does that

11        call for an opinion based upon cigarette design?

12            MR. UITERWYK: It does. Absolutely it does.

13            THE COURT: Well, then how do I -- how do I

14       square that with the sentence, the second sentence

15       on page 3 -- we're looking at the plaintiffs

16       opposition to the motion in limine to exclude

17       Dr. -- certain testimony of Dr. Cummings, where it

18       says in the second sentence:

19            He is not testifying as a scientist on

20       cigarette design, but, rather, testifies

21        concerning the interaction between particular

22       designs and smoking behavior.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Judge, he's not here to

24       design and tell the jury how you should design a

25       cigarette. That's not his purpose. He's not a 2532

1        scientist who has worked for the cigarette

2       companies in connection with the design of the

3       cigarette. And we're not offering him for the

4       purposes of him testifying as to designing of

5       cigarettes.

6            What we're offering him for the purposes,

7       based on all the research and all the studies he's

8       done, he's evaluated what they did with their

9       design that affects the behavior of the -- of the

10       addicted smoker.

11             THE COURT: Okay. What was the pending

12       question, again?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=82
13            MR. WALKER: May I read it, Judge?

14            THE COURT: Yes.

15            MR. WALKER: It's right here on screen.

16       Let's talk about the control of the nicotine in

17       the cigarette. In manufacturing, do cigarette

18       companies have the capability to control and

19       manipulate the nicotine in cigarettes any way they

20       want?

21             THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to sustain that

22       objection, Ms. Humphries.

23            MS. HUMPHRIES: There is one point they

24       didn't direct to you.

25            THE COURT: No. Let's just have one lawyer 2533

1        respond.

2            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, what -

3            THE COURT: You can ask -- you can ask

4       questions specifically with respect to how the

5       design of cigarettes affects, in his opinion,

6       affects behavior in individuals who smoke. But in

7       terms of the design of the cigarettes, I think the

8       statement that he is not testifying as a scientist

9       on cigarette design precludes you from asking

10       questions about how cigarettes are designed.

11             MR. UITERWYK: Well, I don't think

12       it prohibits me, Your Honor, from asking him

13       questions --

14            For instance, he's researched the documents

15       of the cigarette companies to determine what they

16       have done. And he knows -- and that's part of his

17       expertise, is reviewing the documents of what they

18       have done to manipulate the cigarette in order to

19       make it more inhalable and more --to make it

20       easier for the person to take in the nicotine and

21        to become addicted. He's going to talk about that

22       in detail, because that's very much regarding the

23       smoking behavior.

24            THE COURT: But your questions were tailored

25       to can they design cigarettes without -- can they 2534

1        make cigarettes that don't have nicotine in it.

2       And that's a design question.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, actually, this

4       question, exact same question -- exact same --

5            THE COURT: All right. I'm doing the best I

6       can. I'm sustaining the objection. We need to

7       move on.

8            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

9            THE COURT: And while I'm on this subject, I

10       have some concern that I may have made an

11        incorrect ruling earlier today and that we need to

12       have at least a discussion about a curative

13       instruction.

14            The concern I have was when I went into the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=83
15       area of use of cigarette -- Winston cigarettes

16       that have filters, whether or not Jackie Loyd

17       herself relied upon that. And it was highlighted

18       more in terms of when, and there was an objection

19       which I overruled as to speculation, how he could

20       say whether or not a particular person relied upon

21        a particular ad or information.

22            It was highlighted by your additional

23       questions, when you asked Dr. Cummings questions

24       about people who started smoking in their teenage

25       years and whether or not there was advertising 2535

1        that she -- that was made -- that was widely known

2       or widely published during the period of time that

3       she started smoking, or something like that.

4            That's different than did she start smoking

5       as a result of that? It was -- it was information

6       that was available, which you asked that question.

7       Which highlighted in my mind that I may have made

8       a mistake in ruling on his -- his response to a

9       question that you asked: Did she start smoking

10       filtered cigarettes as a result of the marketing?

11       Which I have questions in terms of whether or not

12       anybody can say that anybody did anything else

13       directly as a result of some other actions taken

14       by a third person.

15            So you can ask that. You can ask the

16       question, but I think I need --

17            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

18            THE COURT: Are defendants asking for a

19       curative instruction?

20            MR. WALKER: We are, Judge.

21             THE COURT: Okay. Then I will leave it for

22       you tonight to create a curative instruction on

23       that. And we can review it. And you can go back

24       over -- because I know you're getting

25       instantaneous transcript of this -- what the 2536

1        question was that I overruled. And I will

2       instruct the jury.

3            You can ask similar questions that you asked,

4       what that -- was there information available --

5       and I'm not telling you how to ask the question,

6       but essentially along the lines, Was there

7       information available to Jackie Loyd that filtered

8       cigarettes contained less tar and nicotine during

9       the period of time that she switched from an

10       unfiltered cigarette to a filtered cigarette?

11             And I think it would be up to the jury to

12       determine whether or not she relied upon that.

13       But not whether or not she directly relied. I

14       don't know that any witness can say that. And

15       frankly, I may have had a knee-jerk reaction, and

16       if I'm in a position to correct it, I'd better

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=84
17       correct it now than at a later date.

18            So work on -- yes, work on a curative

19       instruction.

20            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

21             MR. PEDROSA: Thank you, Your Honor.

22            MR. BIGGER: Your Honor, once we see a

23       curative instruction, may we possibly be heard on

24       that tomorrow?

25            THE COURT: Yes. 2537

1            MR. BIGGER: I think there is case law

2       instructing on that issue.

3            THE COURT: Okay. If there is. I don't want

4       a memo of law, because I don't have time to read

5       it.

6            MR. BIGGER: Trust me, I --

7            THE COURT: You can argue it -

8            MR. BIGGER: Yes.

9            THE COURT: -- and I can make the best

10       decision I can.

11             MR. BIGGER: Yes, sir.

12            THE COURT: But I'm concerned that I may have

13       made an improper ruling. And if I have an

14       opportunity to cure it, I need to cure it as soon

15       as possible.

16            And again, it was highlighted by the series

17       of questions that Mr. Uiterwyk asked on the other

18       issue of when she started to smoke. And frankly,

19       it caused me concern when I heard those other

20       questions, and I said, Well, uh-oh, I may have

21        made a mistake on this, and let me bring it up.

22            So --

23            MR. UITERWYK: The time she started to smoke,

24       Your Honor, was in 1951.

25            THE COURT: I know. But the question was did 2538

1        Ms. Loyd change from unfiltered cigarettes based

2       upon that. And I don't know anybody can say what

3       anybody else can do as a result of something. I

4       think it's speculative.

5            So let's move on.

6            MR. UITERWYK: Right.

7            THE COURT: And is this -- just for my own

8       edification, you have tried many cases. It's rare

9       for me to see as many objections in a trial. And

10       I'm not questioning that. I'm not -- not one

11        second am I stating on either side that any

12       objections are raised in -- they're all good faith

13       objections regardless of whether I sustain them or

14       overrule them. So I don't want counsel to infer

15       that any objections are made for frivolous reasons

16       or any response to objections are frivolous.

17       They're all -- everybody has had a good-faith, as

18       far as I'm concerned, basis for raising them.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=85
19            But is this typical, these many objections?

20       Because I don't know how you get through a case in

21        two or three weeks.

22            MR. WALKER: I think it's more common, Judge,

23       when --

24            THE COURT: Is it based upon more your

25       affirmative defenses that are different in this 2539

1        case than maybe in another case?

2            MR. WALKER: No. I-

3            THE COURT: Not that it makes any difference,

4       because this case isn't going to go any shorter

5       based upon your answer. But I'm concerned about

6       how far --

7            MR. WALKER: Some judges have tried eight,

8       nine, ten cases, and with those judges, we kind of

9       already know what the rulings are going to be.

10            THE COURT: Okay.

11             MR. WALKER: So I think it's a little bit

12       different, because we haven't -- Your Honor

13       hasn't --

14            THE COURT: Okay. Well, maybe it's because

15       I'm not as familiar with some of these cases,

16       but --

17            MR. WALKER: That's not what I meant to say.

18            THE COURT: I didn't get this gray hair

19       overnight. And I have been --1 have, both as a

20       lawyer and as a judge, tried my share of cases.

21             MR. WALKER: And I didn't mean it that way.

22            THE COURT: No, I know you didn't mean it.

23       But it --

24            MR. WALKER: We're learning your rulings as

25       we go along. 2540

1            THE COURT: Okay.

2            MR. WALKER: That's the only -

3            THE COURT: It's sort of -- it might be -- it

4       might be more in terms of -- well, okay. Maybe my

5       lack of experience in this.

6            But, you know, I know from experience in

7       talking to other judges that basically these cases

8       fall in the category of two to three weeks. And

9       jury selection was longer, and trial seems to be

10       moving not as fast as I had hoped. And I'm

11        thinking generally, how are these cases tried in

12       two or three weeks?

13            MR. WALKER: They're typically --

14            THE COURT: But maybe it's my rulings that

15       are part of that. If it is, I accept

16       responsibility.

17            MR. WALKER: That's not what I meant, Judge.

18       There typically are more objections with a witness

19       like this one. And so cases that have more

20       witnesses like that one have more objections. But

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=86
21        typically, you have fewer objections with other

22       kinds of witnesses, like fact witnesses --

23            THE COURT: Okay.

24            MR. WALKER: -- and doctors.

25            THE COURT: Well, for whatever reason, we 2541

1        will try and -- we'll move forward as quickly as

2       we can. I do --1 do have an appointment at 5:30

3       tonight, and so we need to break soon after 5:00.

4            MR. BIGGER: Your Honor, I just don't want

5       the record to be silent on that.

6            I don't agree that this is the way this case

7       has to go. I do feel a lot of these objections

8       are unnecessary based on what's been preserved in

9       the papers. And I just want to put that on there.

10       I have tried a case with this witness where I

11        think I had four objections or five objections the

12       entire direct.

13            THE COURT: Okay.

14            MR. BIGGER: So I just --1 do think --

15            THE COURT: Okay.

16            MR. BIGGER: --it can go faster.

17            THE COURT: Okay. My -- my statement -- and

18       I'm not calling you -- each of you are entitled to

19       your other opinion. And I guess Mr. Walker can

20       say, Well, but this case is -- you're eliciting

21        testimony that's different from the other cases.

22            Regardless of that fact or that argument, I

23       don't find that any objection or any response to

24       any objection or any objections made by either

25       party is in any way frivolous or in bad faith. 2542

1        I'm just concerned about the number of objections

2       and whether or not we can get through the

3       testimony and this trial on time. It's not to

4       chastise or imply that anybody is making bad faith

5       objections, because I'm not doing that. I mean, I

6       don't feel that way. It's just a curiosity thing.

7       And I hope counsel accepts my statements for what

8       they are intended to be.

9            MR. WALKER: We've been in front of you long

10       enough to take the comments in the spirit in which

11        they were intended, Judge.

12            THE COURT: Okay.

13            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, one thing is that

14       this is -- we're not re-inventing the wheel here

15       on some of these issues, particularly the issues

16       as it relates, for instance, to Dr. Cummings.

17            Dr. Cummings, the actual hearing that you

18       held, you actually decided at that time, from what

19       I understand -- correct me if I'm wrong, Celene --

20       you were deciding at that time whether he could

21        testify on cigarette design and -- in this case.

22       And that was going to be deferred until you heard

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=87
23       his qualifications as it relates to cigarette

24       design and smoking behavior.

25            THE COURT: Well -2543

1            MR. WALKER: Judge -

2            THE COURT: --1 guess the statement --

3            Where my order on that? I don't --

4            MS. HUMPHRIES: It's at your office now, Your

5       Honor.

6            THE COURT: Well, I know --

7            MS. HUMPHRIES: It's one of the ones --

8            And, Your Honor, we did talk about this

9       point. And they made the same observation then,

10       that we had waived. And at that point I

11        clarified. It's based on the second paragraph

12       that they have not directed you to. The second

13       paragraph in the written presentation. He does

14       testify as an expert on design based on his review

15       of the documents and what they say.

16            So to the extent there is waiver here, they

17       have to show some sort of prejudice or we've

18       blindsided them or something. They've known that

19       he was coming all along like he does in every

20       other trial.

21             THE COURT: Okay.

22            MR. WALKER: If I might. To Ms. Humphries'

23       credit, what she said at the hearing was

24       remarkably similar to what they said in the

25       papers. It took me a minute to find it, but we do 2544

1        have it.

2            And on December 10th, she said, We're not

3       offering Dr. Cummings as a scientist. We're not

4       offering him to talk about ammonia and additives,

5       and we're not talking about vent holes and all of

6       those kinds of things. That's not --

7            What happened at the hearing is not different

8       than what they said in their papers.

9            MS. HUMPHRIES: Your Honor, this is all being

10       argued out of context. And it's so hard for me to

11        sit here quietly.

12            I gave you orders from every judge in

13       Hillsborough who has admitted this man's

14       testimony.

15            THE COURT: I know that. But I can't --1

16       don't know what you said in those other papers. I

17       can't blindly just say, Well, take a vote. It's

18       five to four or six to -- you know, I've got to

19       make up my own mind.

20            MS. HUMPHRIES: And I hear you. And I'm not

21        trying to reargue this.

22            THE COURT: And I don't know what those cases

23       are like. Sure, they may be instructive, but what

24       I'm relying on is what you said in your papers

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=88
25       here, that he's not going to be offered on 2545

1        cigarette design.

2            He can talk more in terms of an

3       epidemiologist in terms of the effects of the

4       design on the people who use cigarettes, but not

5       in terms of the actual design of the cigarettes,

6       which I think you've withdrawn him on.

7            MS. HUMPHRIES: That's where the rub is. And

8       it's so hard for me to 

9            If you look at the very next paragraph is

10       where we make clear what we say. And this

11        argument has been made in every case where this

12       issue has been raised on Dr. Cummings.

13            The plaintiff always says, Are we going to

14       ask him to come in and testify as if he was an RJR

15       scientist regarding performing his own study?

16            No. He's an epidemiologist.

17            His expertise on design is based on

18       everything you've heard this afternoon: His

19       review of documents; his study of the documents

20       that they have written about design.

21             The very next paragraph --

22            THE COURT: You know what? I think he is

23       qualified to testify about design. That's not the

24       issue. I think he is well qualified to testify

25       about it. The issue is what you said in your 2546

1       papers.

2            MS. HUMPHRIES: And you haven't looked at

3       the --

4            THE COURT: I've read the entire paragraph.

5       And my ruling is he's not going to talk about the

6       specific design of the cigarettes, but he can talk

7       about the effects of the design on the

8       individuals.

9            MR. UITERWYK: He can't talk about the

10       effects of the design on the human behavior, on

11        smoking behavior without discussing what they did

12       to the design to affect the smoking behavior. It

13       is totally --

14            He's not coming here as a scientist who

15       designs cigarettes. That is not what he's been

16       presented as. He's being presented as what did

17       they do to the cigarettes, to manipulate the

18       cigarettes -- he pulled me back.

19            MR. BIGGER: Is there a chain, Your Honor?

20            THE COURT: It's like a coach is being pulled

21        off the sidelines.

22            MR. UITERWYK: Sidelines, right. I got a

23        15-yard penalty. Right, Judge? So anyway, I

24       didn't get a warning. Yeah, I got a warning too,

25       so I do get a 15-yard penalty. 2547

1            But anyway, the only way he can testify as to

2       what they did to the cigarettes and what -- how

3       they manipulate the cigarette, how that affected

4       human behavior, which is what he is going to do

5       and which is what they said that he is going to

6       do.

7            For instance, there is an example of a B&W

8       document. It's PT --

9            THE COURT: A Brown & Williamson?

10            MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

11             THE COURT: Okay.

12            MR. UITERWYK: And here they say, Certainly

13       the nicotine level of B&W cigarettes, given the

14       above data, was not obtained by accident.

15            It may be well --it may be well to remind

16       you, however, that we have a research project in

17       progress to obtain by genetic means any level of

18       nicotine desired.

19            And that's -- this is from a document. This

20       is not -- this is where I asked him the question:

21        Did they manipulate and do they manipulate the

22       cigarette?

23            The documents say they do. They do

24       manipulate.

25            As a matter of fact, as part -- two things. 2548

1        As part of the blending process --

2            THE COURT: Okay. He can testify about the

3       manipulation of cigarettes, because they affect

4       the human behavior of these individuals. But he

5       can't say that they were -- I'm trying to think of

6       a pure design issue --

7            MR. WALKER: Well, he testified that filters

8       don't work, that they were a gimmick. Or this

9       idea about whether the companies had the

10       capability to manipulate nicotine.

11             Judge, I know --1 know that you're trying to

12       take each question at a time and make the right

13       rulings. I waited to raise this issue because I

14       didn't know if they were going to cross the line

15       that they set out in their papers. That question

16       crossed it. Will future questions cross it? I

17       don't know. You probably don't know.

18            THE COURT: All right. Let's - as long as

19       the questions are tied to the issue of human

20       dependence or nicotine addiction or --1 mean,

21        that's -- or cessation of smoking, then I -- then

22       I'm going to allow it. That's a broad category.

23       I have to rule on each question, you know.

24            MR. UITERWYK: Can I also talk about what the

25       documents reflect in that regard? Because he's an 2549

1        expert in documents.

2            THE COURT: You know, I can't - I have to

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=90
3       take it one at a time.

4            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

5            THE COURT: Okay? That's the best I can do.

6       I have somebody's book here.

7            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, I'm assuming that's

8       probably another one of mine, so I will come take

9       it.

10            I will just add, Your Honor, that that last

11        question, just to be clear, your objection -- the

12       objection is sustained as to that last question?

13            THE COURT: I don't remember what the

14       question was.

15            MR. PEDROSA: I think the last question went

16       to the feasibility of a different design.

17            THE COURT: Okay. That objection is

18       sustained.

19            MR. BIGGER: I don't believe the witness

20       remembers. You'll have to reask that.

21             MR. UITERWYK: You know, I will tell you the

22       next question, Judge, in a different way, so we

23       don't have to go back up here again and interrupt

24       the trial.

25            When we talk about the defendant designing, 2550

1        engineering and manipulation of cigarettes to be a

2       perfect drug delivery device for nicotine --

3            I didn't ask the question.

4            Do the cigarette companies basically

5       manipulate the cigarette to be a perfect drug

6       delivery device for nicotine in order to cause and

7       sustain addiction?

8            MR. WALKER: See, I think that's

9       objectionable. He's not asking about a particular

10       design and how the design affects people. He's

11        asking about how the companies design cigarettes

12       and for what purpose.

13            THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to overrule the

14       objection on that. I'm going to overrule the

15       objection on that.

16            MS. HUMPHRIES: And just for - -

17            THE COURT: Admittedly, I will give everybody

18       their due, it's a close question. But I'm going

19       to have to call it based upon each question. So

20       if you want to stand up and object, you're free to

21        do so. Maybe after a few of them, we'll hit a

22       common theme, but --

23            MR. BIGGER: May I get the witness, Judge?

24            THE COURT: Yes.

25            (The witness returned to the stand.) 2551

1            THE COURT: You can bring in the jury,

2       please.

3            (The jury returned to the courtroom at

4       4:47 p.m.)

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=91
5            THE COURT: Thank you. We're ready. Thank

6       you for your patience. We're ready to continue.

7            Mr. Uiterwyk.

8            MR. UITERWYK: Dr. Cummings, before we took

9       the break --

10            May it please the Court.

11             THE COURT: Yes, sir.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   Before we took the break, we were talking

14   about nicotine and cigarettes. Do you recall that?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   And I believe you testified earlier that

17   nicotine in cigarettes is what causes addiction?

18       A.   That's right.

19       Q.   Now, based on your review of the records,

20   based on your knowledge and expertise of cigarette

21    design as it relates to smoking behavior, do the

22   cigarette companies, including these defendants,

23   design, engineer, and manipulate the cigarette to be a

24   perfect drug delivery device for nicotine in order to

25   cause and sustain addiction? 2552

1            MR. WALKER: Objection. Argumentative and

2       the prior grounds.

3            THE COURT: Overruled.

4            THE WITNESS: Yes, they do.

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   And have you reviewed records from the

7   tobacco companies where they discuss the design and

8   manipulation of their cigarettes in order to be a

9   perfect drug delivery device?

10       A.   I have.

11        Q.   Have you seen records where they actually

12   refer to the cigarette as being a drug delivery device?

13       A.   I have.

14       Q.   All right. Now, can -- strike that.

15            And have you, through your work over your

16   career, gotten the sense of the amount of resources and

17   the time and effort that the defendants have put in the

18   subject of the addictive properties of nicotine and how

19   to deliver that nicotine in a perfect way to sustain --

20   to cause and sustain addiction?

21        A.   I have.

22       Q.   Tell the jury in general about that.

23       A.   Sure. I mean, it's a -- the engineering of

24   the product has been a key element of their marketing

25   of the product. It's one of the four Ps -- product 2553

1    engineering, price, promotion, placement -- and it's

2   reflected in their internal business records that they

3   engineered their product for different target

4   audiences, and specifically to make sure that they have

5   sufficient amount of nicotine to satisfy the consumer

6   so they will continue to buy their product.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=92
7       Q.   And in doing that, have they manipulated that

8   level in order to cause and sustain the addiction?

9       A.   They have manipulated the level through a

10   variety of methodologies they have used, blending, use

11    of additives and the design and engineering of the

12   product.

13       Q.   Why is it important or why is it that they

14   manipulate the level of nicotine for the purposes of

15   causing and sustaining addiction for a product that

16   kills people?

17       A.   It's the reason for people to continue to go

18   back and use the product, purchase the product, and

19   it's directly related to their profits. So if they did

20   not basically maintain the nicotine levels to the

21    sufficient level, most of their customers would leave

22   them if they could.

23       Q.   How long has the tobacco industry known that

24   the nicotine in their cigarettes they sell are

25   addictive, based on your review of the records? 2554

1        A.   Well, I think, you know, people have known

2   for, you know, over a century that it's hard to quit.

3   But the understanding of the addictive nature of it I

4   think is something that modern science has, you know,

5   pretty much defined I would say back to the fifties.

6   Again, the records that are available are primarily

7   from the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties and

8   nineties from the companies.

9       Q.   When did they first admit in public that

10   cigarettes were addictive?

11        A.   These defendants?

12       Q.   Yes.

13       A.   Not until around 2004, from my study.

14       Q.   Now, in the process of looking at

15   manipulating the cigarettes to cause and sustain

16   addiction, have they also researched and designed

17   because of the way the cigarettes act on the brain?

18            MR. WALKER: Objection.

19            THE WITNESS: Yes, sir.

20            MR. WALKER: Argumentative as to the premise

21        of the question.

22            THE COURT: Overruled.

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   Go ahead.

25       A.   Yes. They've studied how cigarettes affect 2555

1   the central nervous system. They've done studies to

2   affect receptor sites in the brain where nicotine has

3   its effect, and then explored the use of certain

4   additives and design features that would facilitate

5   nicotine binding in the brain where it has its effect.

6       Q.   All right. Let's look at slide No. 21.

7            Have you prepared a slide that shows -- that

8   will show to the jury how their nicotine in their

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=93
9   cigarettes that they manipulated goes to the brain and

10   affects the smoker?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   All right. And this is nicotine in the

13   brain. Cigarettes, rapid delivery, and many receptors.

14   Let's talk about it first.

15            If I had a cigarette right here and put it in

16   my mouth and lit it and inhaled it, explain to the jury

17   what happens.

18       A.   One of the reasons that cigarettes are more

19   addictive than other forms of getting nicotine, like a

20   patch or other forms, is it's inhaled. So it's -- the

21    delivery system makes a big difference.

22            So getting it into the lungs, the large

23   surface area facilitates the rapid absorption of the

24   nicotine into the bloodstream and allows it to hit the

25   brain within, you know, literally seconds after taking 2556

1    a drag on a cigarette, about 7 to 10 seconds.

2            Heroin, for example, injected into the veins,

3   30 seconds. So even slower.

4            So this is rapid delivery. And one of the

5   features of drug reward which is reinforcing is speed

6   of delivery of the drug.

7            So this very simple diagram is designed to

8   depict that cigarette smoke is engineered to be

9   inhaled. It doesn't have to be that way, but it is.

10   And when it is inhaled into the lungs to facilitate

11    rapid absorption, it affects receptors both in the

12   lungs -- and it's these green -- the middle chart there

13   is just showing how the nicotine is mainlining into the

14   brain. And after repeated exposure, you affect the

15   structure of the brain, these receptor sites, the

16   nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain, and

17   these receptors actually grow new receptors in the

18   brain.

19            And so smokers' brains are different than

20   nonsmokers' brains. And there are autopsy studies that

21    have been done of that, and animal studies and those

22   kind of things, to show that the brain is actually

23   altered. And the earlier the exposure occurs, the more

24   likely you're going to see some of those structural

25   changes in the brain, which is how the brain interacts 2557

1   in terms of the signals in the brain, which affects how

2   do we feel, our mood and feelings.

3       Q.   And going back to the first slide on the

4   left, a young person who first lights a cigarette, the

5   first time, do they have trouble inhaling?

6       A.   Yes. They usually cough. It's a little

7   noxious. They will get lightheaded from the carbon

8   monoxide from the cigarette smoke. It's usually

9   aversive. You have to overcome that. You may have to

10   learn. They talk about learning how to smoke and how

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=94
11    to inhale it.

12       Q.   Now, people smoke cigars and they don't

13   inhale it. How come, after learning, they're able to

14   smoke cigarettes? And what, if anything, do the

15   cigarette companies do as it relates to cigarettes in

16   particular and their cigarettes in particular to make

17   it easier for the person to inhale it versus the person

18   who smokes a cigar?

19            MR. WALKER: Objection to the compound

20       question.

21             THE COURT: Sustained. It is compound.

22   BY MR. UITERWYK:

23       Q.   All right. Let me break it down.

24            All right. Do people typically inhale

25   cigars? 2558

1        A.   If you've only -- only smoked a cigar,

2   probably not.

3       Q.   Okay. And is lung cancer a problem with

4   cigars in general?

5       A.   Not in general. COPD and lung cancer rates

6   in cigar smokers are dramatically lower than they are

7   for cigarette smokers because of the lung exposure.

8       Q.   All right. And what do you mean by the lung

9   exposure?

10       A.   People aren't getting the smoke into the

11    lungs. Most cigar smokers hold the smoke in the mouth,

12   because the tobacco that's used in cigars has a higher

13   pH, so it's more basic, which is aversive. So it's

14   hard to inhale it. So -- and that has to do with the

15   type of tobacco that's used in cigars. And so most

16   people who smoke -- and I'm talking about the cigars

17   that use the tobacco as the wrapper, you know, a

18   premium cigar, not the knock-off small cigars which

19   really are more like cigarettes, and people do inhale

20   those. So you have to -- I'm talking about the large

21    cigars, which are loaded with nicotine. The nicotine

22   doesn't get into the lungs. It's almost all absorbed

23   through the lining of the mouth, and people don't

24   inhale it. So we see mouth cancer, we see some sinus

25   cancer from cigar smoke, but lung cancer and COPD not 2559

1    so much.

2       Q.   All right. And let's talk about -- you

3   mentioned the term pH, and we're going to go there a

4   little bit later in your testimony as it relates to how

5   they manipulated the cigarette as far as pH is

6   concerned. But based on your research, do they

7   manipulate the pH to make it easier to inhale the

8   cigarette?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   And by the manipulating of the pH to make the

11    cigarette easier to inhale, does it make it easier to

12   become addicted because they can now inhale the

13   nicotine into the lungs so it goes straight to the

14   brain in ten seconds?

15            MR. WALKER: Objection, leading.

16            THE COURT: Overruled.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   Go ahead.

19       A.   Yes, they do. I mean, through blending, you

20   can manipulate pH. That's why the flue cured tobacco

21    that's used in cigarettes is part of the American

22   blend, it made it easier to inhale. And also, you can

23   manipulate it in other ways through the use of certain

24   additives and so on in the product.

25       Q.   We'll talk about that -2560

1            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Move to

2       strike based upon the pretrial representations.

3            THE COURT: Overruled.

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   All right. And we will talk more about the

6   manipulation of the cigarettes in order to cause and

7   sustain addiction.

8            Did you testify -- and I may have missed

9   it -- how fast in the case of the cigarettes, because

10   people can inhale because of the manipulation, how fast

11    it goes to the brain?

12       A.   Seven to ten seconds.

13       Q.   And you mentioned that when this goes to the

14   brain, you talked, quickly, about receptors. And you

15   mentioned neurotransmitters, and those kind of terms.

16   And I want to go back for a minute to kind of help us

17   understand a little bit of what you're talking about.

18       A.   Sure.

19       Q.   Do we have neurotransmitters in our brain,

20   who are nonsmokers?

21        A.   Sure. We all do.

22       Q.   And do these neurotransmitters normally

23   release certain Dopamine, endorphins, serotonin and

24   things like that?

25       A.   Sure. It's how we regulate our moods. 2561

1        Q.   Right. And when a person smokes a cigarette

2   that's been manipulated to make it easier to inhale and

3   allows it to go to the neurotransmitters, to the brain,

4   does that nicotine then create -- first of all, unlock

5   the neurotransmitters to release the receptors? Or am

6   I getting it backwards?

7       A.   Unlock the receptors to release the

8   neurotransmitters.

9       Q.   Correct.

10       A.   Right.

11        Q.   And when it releases the neurotransmitters,

12   does it release certain endorphins and Dopamine and

13   serotonin and things like that?

14       A.   There is all chemical cascades, some of which

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=96
15   are rewarding -- as I mentioned, Dopamine. There is

16   also serotonin, which helps moderate our mood. In

17   other words, if you're feeling a little down or

18   depressed, it sort of picks you up a little bit and

19   makes you feel better. It helps you concentrate. So

20   it has effects on memory. It can have appetite

21    suppressant effects. So there are a whole array of

22   these neurotransmitters which are the chemicals that

23   sort of mediate the signaling between neurons in our

24   brain.

25       Q.   And when you have -- when a person becomes 2562

1    addicted and they release these neurotransmitters,

2   which release what we're going to talk about, different

3   chemicals, does it actually take over for what the body

4   normally would release of these particular type of

5   compounds?

6       A.   Right.

7            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

8            THE COURT: Overruled.

9            THE WITNESS: Yes, it does. I mean, the body

10       has a way of normally regulating the release of

11        these normal -- you know, these neurotransmitters

12       in the brain. And what it does is overstimulate

13       and change the normal regulatory mechanism.

14            Nicotine is foreign to the body, so that's --

15       it actually has an effect on the brain because of

16       the drug, as similar to like cocaine and heroin,

17       which is what -- why the Surgeon General concluded

18       there were similar effects of nicotine compared to

19       those other drugs.

20   BY MR. UITERWYK:

21        Q.   And so then as part of the addictive process,

22   as a result of inhaling this smoke because they

23   manipulate it to make it easier to do, do the people

24   then become addicted to the neurotransmitters that have

25   been created and taken over for the normal body -- the 2563

1   body's normal neurotransmitters?

2       A.   Well, what happens when you have repeated

3   exposure to a drug like nicotine and you develop a

4   tolerance, you need the drug to get the release of

5   these neurotransmitters like Dopamine to feel normal.

6   And then in the absence of the drug, trying to quit or

7   abstaining, you begin to feel abnormal, irritable,

8   anxious, nervous, grumpy. These are some of the things

9   people talk about.

10            Really what's happening is the body is trying

11    to compensate, because you rewired the brain. And

12   that's why I talked about structure, because those

13   neurotransmitters -- the receptors, rather, in the

14   brain, you actually grow new receptors in the brain,

15   and you need the drug in order to get the

16   neurotransmitters to affect your mood to feel normal.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=97
17   And the absence of that is not feeling normal. And

18   some people find themselves in a cycle of smoking to,

19   you know, essentially alleviate the withdrawal they

20   experience, which they often experience within two to

21    three hours after finishing a cigarette, because the

22   nicotine levels drop, you know, rapidly after they

23   smoke.

24       Q.   And that's what causes you in the middle of

25   the night and early in the morning? 2564

1        A.   That's where we see that characteristic

2   pattern in people who are drug addicted.

3            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Now, let's go over

4       the slide, Nicotine Stimulates Release Of Various

5       Neurotransmitters. Can we go to that for a

6       moment, please, tab 33.

7            THE COURT: Are we going to another area?

8            MR. UITERWYK: No.

9            THE COURT: Okay.

10            MR. UITERWYK: Not quite.

11             THE COURT: When we do, that will be a

12       natural stopping point.

13            MR. UITERWYK: Thank you, Your Honor.

14            Do you have that? It's tab 33.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   Okay. Are these -- when you talked about

17   people inhaling cigarettes, are these the

18   neurotransmitters that are stimulated by the nicotine

19   after it's been inhaled and then brought -- and follows

20   into the bloodstream into the brain?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   And can we go over those various

23   neurotransmitters and what's released.

24            Dopamine. What is Dopamine?

25       A.   Dopamine is a chemical that affects our mood 2565

1    and specifically is a reward chemical, so it gives us

2   pleasure. So this is one of the reasons that many

3   people say they enjoy smoking.

4       Q.   All right. And the same with serotonin. And

5   appetite suppression, do smokers who have been addicted

6   to cigarettes containing nicotine, frequently, when

7   they quit smoking, gain weight?

8       A.   They do for a couple of reasons. For one is

9   they tend to have a craving for sweet foods in

10   particular because their appetite suppression effects

11    in the brain from some of the neurochemicals is

12   essentially switched off. And they also get

13   stimulation from nicotine, which acts physiologically

14   as a stimulating effect. And when you stop smoking,

15   it's very common for people to feel a little fatigue

16   right after they've quit, because they have been used

17   to the nicotine affecting their stimulation, because it

18   is a stimulant.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=98
19       Q.   And serotonin basically has the same type of

20   effect?

21        A.   Yes. Serotonin is one of those chemicals in

22   the brain that are released by the action of nicotine

23   in the brain.

24       Q.   And do people -- and epinephrine and

25   norepinephrine -- don't ask me to say it again -- but 2566

1    does that -- also, it says arousal and appetite

2   suppression. We talked about the appetite suppression.

3   But arousal, is this what people say, it helps me

4   concentrate?

5       A.   Yes. It's a stimulant, so the arousing

6   effects come from the epinephrine and norepinephrine.

7   Serotonin mood modulation really helps relax you, so

8   you get both this dual effect, this stimulation effect

9   and a relaxing effect which people will report as a

10   result of smoking cigarettes. And the absence of that

11    is feeling anxious and nervous and fatigued.

12       Q.   Based on your review of the records, do the

13   cigarette companies, do they and have the cigarette

14   companies known about this effect on the

15   neurotransmitters and the effect that -- the

16   physiological effect on the brain, Dr. Cummings?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   And is that, based on your review, in your

19   opinion, why they actually manipulated the level of

20   nicotine and/or the pH in order to make it more easily

21    inhalable and to cause and sustain addiction?

22            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Lack of

23       foundation as to why the companies did something.

24            THE COURT: Overruled.

25            MR. PEDROSA: Also objection, speculation, 2567

1        and --

2            THE COURT: I didn't hear you, Mr. Pedrosa.

3            MR. PEDROSA: Yes. Also objection,

4       speculation and pretrial ruling on additives.

5            THE COURT: Okay. Overruled.

6            THE WITNESS: Yes. They controlled the

7       nicotine. They knew if they dropped the level of

8       nicotine to low, people would actually not feel --

9       they wouldn't get the satisfaction and pleasure,

10       and they would reject the product and would

11        discontinue using it.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   All right. And we've got acetylcholine,

14   we've got vasopressin, glutamate, B endorphin, and are

15   all these neurotransmitters that are affected by the

16   addiction to the nicotine and the nicotine as it goes

17   to the brain?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   All right. Now, if the people -- if they

20   left the cigarette alone, didn't do anything to it,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=99
21   just tobacco in a piece of paper without the

22   manipulation, would most people be able to inhale on a

23   long-term basis?

24       A.   No. Most people wouldn't use the tobacco

25   that way. They call it rabbit tobacco, you know, just 2568

1   pick it off the plant and you roll it up in a piece of

2   paper and smoke it. First of all, they wouldn't get

3   precise dosing of nicotine. That's not obtained by,

4   you know, chance. The amount of nicotine you get in a

5   commercial cigarette is precisely defined and studied.

6       Q.   One question. I know the judge wants to --

7       A.   Sure.

8       Q.   And if they just left it alone --

9       A.   Left it alone --

10       Q.   Hold on. Let me finish.

11        A.   Sure.

12       Q.   If they left it alone, would most people

13   become addicted?

14       A.   No.

15       Q.   Like the cigarettes they manufacture and

16   manipulate?

17       A.   No, they would not.

18            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Thank you, sir, Doctor.

19            THE COURT: Is this a good breaking point?

20            MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

21             THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

22            All right. Members of the jury, we're going

23       to break for this afternoon. We're going to --1

24       do have some more technical issues to deal with

25       with the lawyers, and unfortunately we can't do it 2569

1        this evening. I have got to be someplace else, so

2       we're going to -- the lawyers and I are going to

3       actually -- going to actually start our session at

4       8:00 and hopefully we'll be done by the time

5       you're coming back, which will be ten o'clock.

6            So you'll have an extra hour tomorrow

7       morning. Hopefully we can resolve most of the

8       issues that we need to resolve, so we can

9       hopefully hit the ground running.

10            I want to stress to you that these are

11        complicated issues. The lawyers are being very

12       professional in representing their clients, and

13       it's no reflection on the lawyers at all. It's

14       just a question of the issues that we're dealing

15       with.

16            So keep an open mind. Do not communicate

17       about this case with anyone in any manner

18       whatsoever and do not allow this case to be

19       discussed in your presence. We'll see you

20       tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m. Thank you.

23            THE COURT: Thank you, Doctor. You can wait

24       outside.

25            (The witness exited the courtroom.) 2570

1            MR. BIGGER: You're not going to need

2       Dr. Cummings again?

3            THE COURT: No, not tonight.

4            MR. BIGGER: I need to see about his

5       arrangements and hotel. Would that be okay?

6            THE COURT: Sure. I expect counsel to

7       review --

8            MR. BIGGER: Be here at 10:00?

9            THE COURT: Yes.

10            MR. BIGGER: Thank you, Your Honor.

11             THE COURT: I expect counsel to review the

12       remaining documents that plaintiff intends to

13       offer either as demonstrative aids or exhibits so

14       we can move through them as quickly as possible

15       and take up the issue of any curative instruction

16       regarding the issue that I addressed about half an

17       hour ago.

18            MR. WALKER: We just need to receive a copy

19       of the next set from plaintiffs.

20            THE COURT: Okay. That's true.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Yeah. You know what,

22       Mr. Walker and I agree on one thing.

23            THE COURT: Okay. Well --

24            MR. UITERWYK: Can't do it without looking at

25       it. They know the exhibits, though, Judge. 2571

1            THE COURT: Okay. All right. We'll be in

2       recess until 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

3            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

4            THE COURT: Have a good night.

2            (The jury entered the courtroom.)

3            THE COURT: Thank you. Be seated. We're ready

4       to proceed. Before we start up with another

5       question to Dr. Cummings, I have an instruction for

6       the jury.

7            Ladies and gentlemen, during Dr. Cummings'

8       testimony yesterday afternoon, Dr. Cummings

9       testified that Mrs. Loyd relied on information in

10       commercials, advertising, marketing, and other

11        representations put out by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

12       Company and Lorillard Tobacco Company in connection

13       with Winston cigarettes, Kent cigarettes, and True

14       cigarettes.

15            I'm instructing you to disregard that

16       testimony. Thank you.

17            MR. UITERWYK: May it please the Court.

18            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

19                  KENNETH MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D.,

20   plaintiffs witness herein, being previously duly sworn

21    on oath, testified as follows:

22                  DIRECT EXAMINATION (CONTINUED)

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   Good morning, Doctor.

25       A.   Good morning. 2680

1       Q.   I believe when we left off yesterday we were

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=105
2   discussing some issues regarding cigarette manipulation

3   for the purposes of causing and sustaining addiction.

4   And we also, I believe, were talking about how -- the

5   manipulation of the cigarettes to cause and sustain

6   addiction in the matters we discussed, which is the

7   adjusting of the nicotine and pH, how it affected --1

8   believe you testified the younger people initially who

9   started smoking.

10       A.   I testified that there is evidence that the

11    companies engineered their products for different

12   segments of the market, including young people who were

13   just learning how to smoke. And there were products

14   engineered for them, as well as products engineered for

15   people who were confirmed smokers and were looking to

16   perhaps switch to different brands.

17       Q.   So did -- do you have -- based on your research

18   and review of the company documents, did you see whether

19   or not the tobacco companies, meaning the defendants'

20   cigarette companies, RJR and Lorillard, in fact, would

21    design cigarettes in one way to appeal to the youth,

22   starting smokers, the teenagers, differently than they

23   would design for people who were either older or more

24   confirmed or more addicted smokers?

25       A.   Yes. 2681

1        Q.   Tell the jury about that.

2       A.   Well, there's evidence that the products that

3   are engineered for young people, you don't want to give

4   them too much nicotine to start off with, because it

5   would be too aversive. So getting the proper amount or

6   dose so people can learn how to smoke without having it

7   be aversive, particularly making a product milder, less

8   irritating. Use of flavorants are often added to give

9   appeal to the product, because typically a young person

10   begins smoking not for nicotine, but for the

11   psychosocial factor. Fancy way of saying for friends,

12   to look cool, a little rebelliousness.

13            There are a lot of factors that influence young

14   people to experiment with cigarettes. And they have to,

15   you know, essentially learn how to inhale the smoke.

16   And once there are alterations to the brain, they get

17   addicted to the product. Then they're primarily smoking

18   for nicotine. And the companies knew this and designed

19   their products accordingly.

20       Q.   I want you to assume that there's going to be

21    evidence that Jackie Loyd did smoke, early on, Camel

22   cigarettes, unfiltered Camel cigarettes. And I want you

23   to assume further that following that, in 1954

24   approximately, she switched to Kent -- sorry -- Kent --

25   Winston. And then I want you to assume that then in the 2682

1    '80s, she was still smoking Winstons. And then she

2   started to smoke Kent, lighter -- advertised as a

3   lighter tar and nicotine, including Kent III. And that

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=106
4   in the early '90s, as we've seen in the demonstrative

5   that we showed the jury yesterday, she switched.

6            And based on your review of the information and

7   your review of the documents and your research in this

8   area, have you seen that the cigarette companies who

9   manufacture those products that I just -- just outlined

10   to you manipulated the cigarettes in the manners we

11    discussed yesterday, and will discuss more today, in

12   order to cause and sustain addiction to smokers like

13   Jackie Loyd who smoked their products?

14            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Leading.

15       Compound question.

16            THE COURT: Overruled.

17            THE WITNESS: Yes, I've seen evidence to that

18       effect, that they engineered their product in

19       specific ways that were intended to maintain a

20       minimum amount of nicotine in their product, to

21        reduce the harshness and facilitate inhalation so

22       people would begin to smoke those cigarettes and

23       would continue to smoke them once they got addicted.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   And we talked, I believe, yesterday also, when 2683

1    a person starts -- and I believe -- what was the

2   percentage of people who start as teenagers, basically?

3       A.   Well, before the age of 18, first

4   experimentation, just trying the cigarette, not going on

5   to, you know, adopt it as a regular pattern is about 90

6   percent of cigarette use begins before the age of 18 in

7   terms of experimentation.

8            In terms of actually adopting smoking, 95

9   percent of cigarette adoption occurs between the ages of

10    12 and 24, about 5 percent after the age of 25. About

11    half of that is before the age of 18 in terms of

12   becoming regular daily smokers. I think the average age

13   of those who become regular smokers, when you ask adults

14   what age did you become a regular smoker, is around 16,

15    16 and a half.

16       Q.   Did the cigarette companies know this?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   Did they study this?

19       A.   They did.

20       Q.   And will we see evidence later with regard to

21    these studies?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   And we talked yesterday, I think, briefly about

24   how the -- and did they -- strike that.

25            And how younger people started smoking, how it 2684

1    affected ultimately the strength of their addiction the

2   younger they smoked, started smoking?

3       A.   The earlier you start smoking, the more likely

4   it is you'll be a heavy smoker and find it harder to

5   quit.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=107
6       Q.   And the younger the person starts smoking and

7   then becomes addicted, does it affect the likelihood

8   that they are going to develop a smoking-related disease

9   like COPD and lung cancer?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   Is that because they have more doses of the

12   tars and the carcinogens to their lungs?

13            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

14            THE COURT: Overruled.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   Go ahead.

17       A.   Yes, for two reasons. One is, if you start

18   earlier, you have more years, duration is longer. And

19   as I've indicated before, the evidence is, the earlier

20   somebody smokes, they tend to, as an adult, have a

21    heavier smoking pattern and, as a result, they have a

22   higher dose as well. So that combination is one of the

23   reasons you find early initiation related to the

24   development of things like COPD and lung cancer.

25       Q.   What did the cigarette companies call these 2685

1    early smokers, the young smokers, the youth, the

2   first-time smokers? What did they call them?

3       A.   Well, they have a variety of names. Among them

4   were replacement smokers.

5       Q.   Replacement for what?

6       A.   They were replacements for the people who quit

7   smoking or died.

8       Q.   And we were talking about the doses that

9   they're being subjected to after they become addicted.

10            And have you assisted in the preparation of a

11    slide showing doses and how that causes smoking-related

12   diseases?

13       A.   Yes.

14            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Slide 24, please.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   And if you could, could you calculate for

17   Jackie Loyd how many, basically, puffs she had, and how

18   many exposures she had to her lungs during the period of

19   time that she smoked, and how many exposures to

20   carcinogens she had in her lungs during that timeframe?

21        A.   Yeah. This is a rough calculation. It takes

22   account of the number of years that were reported in her

23   medical record as to her duration of smoking, which was

24   42 years. The testimony I reviewed indicated she smoked

25   anywhere from one to two packs. So I've, you know, 2686

1    calculated the numbers, and so you have a range of

2   exposure.

3            And then the Surgeon General's report in 1988,

4   based on studies of human smoking behavior, calculated

5   that the average smoker takes about ten puffs out of

6   every cigarette. So if you look at every puff as a dose

7   of the exposure, you can work the numbers. And it's

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=108
8   anywhere from 3 million to 6 million individual

9   exposures to 7,000 chemicals. So 60 -- or about 70 of

10   those, 69 of them are known or suspect carcinogens. So,

11    obviously, it's a toxic mix in every dose. You get

12   exposed and it does your body damage.

13       Q.   Now, in your opinion, what caused her to take

14   in these number of doses that exposed her lungs to those

15   carcinogens that ultimately led to her lung cancer and

16   death?

17       A.   Her nicotine addiction. Nicotine addiction is

18   the reason people, you know, smoke for the duration and

19   somebody like Jackie Loyd smoked.

20       Q.   All right. Go ahead.

21        A.   That's the explanation that I've come to from

22   my research and training and also my review of the

23   internal business records of the companies.

24       Q.   How did the defendants in this case, the

25   cigarette companies, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and 2687

1   Lorillard, play a substantial part, contributing part,

2   in her taking these doses, between 3,066,000 and

3   6,132,000 doses, during her -- up to the year 1993?

4       A.   Sure. Several things.

5            Number one is, they engineered the product so

6   it was easy to inhale and get addicted.

7            Number two, they engineered their product to

8   make sure that there was a sufficient amount of nicotine

9   that could be extracted out of the product to keep

10   somebody who was addicted continuing to smoke. In other

11    words, engineered the product in order to make it hard

12   to quit. And they didn't have to do those. Those were

13   choices that they made in the engineering department.

14            Number three, they represented their product as

15   safe to use in their marketing claims to consumers.

16            Number four is they basically told their

17   consumers and represented to their consumers that their

18   products were not injurious to health. If there was

19   anything bad, they would remove any of the harmful

20   constituents, reassuring any of their consumers that it

21    was a perfectly normal and acceptable thing to continue

22   to use their products. And they did that during the

23   entire time that Jackie Loyd was a smoker.

24       Q.   All right. But for their design engineering,

25   manipulation of the product, the marketing you discussed 2688

1    and the other factors you discussed that the cigarette

2   companies did in playing a substantial contributing part

3   in her taking these doses and developing the lung cancer

4   and death, would Jackie Loyd have taken these number of

5   doses, in your opinion?

6       A.   In my opinion, no.

7       Q.   Why not?

8       A.   Well, most smokers would quit if they could,

9   but because it's hard to stop, people continue to smoke.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=109
10   They create justifications to continue to expose

11    themselves to cigarettes saying, "I'll quit one of these

12   days," "I'll avoid the problems," "It won't happen to

13   me," all kinds of excuses.

14            In fact, the cigarette companies facilitated

15   those excuses, including coming out initially with

16   filters and later with supposedly low-tar products

17   which, in fact, were not low in tar and nicotine.

18   Because of the way they were engineered, they had enough

19   nicotine in it so that the smoker could puff and simply

20   get the exact level of tar and nicotine that they would

21    have been getting from a non-filtered cigarette.

22       Q.   Briefly, on the left side of this slide there

23   is a reference to a social smoker. Is that what we

24   talked about yesterday as being a "chipper"?

25       A.   Yeah, non-daily smoker. 2689

1        Q.   And do these -- typically, these chippers who

2   smoke a pack a month, 240 cigarettes a year, 10 puffs

3   per cigarette, do they even approach the level of

4   developing lung cancer and cigarette-related diseases?

5       A.   Not if somebody who smokes to the level that

6   Jacqueline Loyd did. I mean, obviously, there is an

7   increased risk with any exposure that you get, so even,

8   you know, intermittent smokers have a slightly higher

9   risk of lung cancer and COPD compared to somebody who

10   has never smoked at all. However, it's quite different.

11    And the relevant risks for COPD for somebody with

12   Jacqueline Loyd's smoking history is about 20 fold

13   greater.

14            In fact, the risk, the relative risks, have

15   been increasing over time, which is a reflection of the

16   fact that the cigarettes are becoming more dangerous

17   because of the way they have been engineered with the

18   addition of filters that make the particle sizes smaller

19   facilitating deeper inhalation, masking harshness to

20   facilitate deeper inhalation. All of those design

21    changes have actually made the products more dangerous

22   than they were, which is why, when we look at cohorts --

23   prefer to cohorts as smokers -- actually the risks are

24   becoming worse. And, in fact, that's reflected in the

25   Surgeon General's --2690

1            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

2       Nonresponsive and narrative.

3            THE COURT: Overruled.

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   You were finishing?

6       A.   I said that's reflected in the recent summaries

7   in the Surgeon General's reports and also in recent

8   medical journal articles.

9            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

10       Bolstering. Move to strike.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   All right. Now, are there methods to measure

14   how heavy Jackie Loyd was addicted; and are these

15   methods used, not only for Jackie Loyd or by you in this

16   case, but used throughout the industry?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   And initially when Jackie Loyd started smoking

19   and for the first, I guess, months or whatever, what

20   would you rate her level of addiction at the initial

21    stages?

22       A.   Well, it's hard to know what they were at the

23   initial stages, although, you know, some of the

24   testimony indicated she was smoking pretty readily from

25    1951 on on a persistent daily basis. 2691

1            But typically what you see is you have to build

2   up. People don't start out at two packs a day. They

3   usually start out, you know, a couple of cigarettes here

4   and there; and then they're buying cigarettes, maybe

5   half a pack, a pack; then they get up to their daily

6   nicotine dose.

7            And people end up at that daily level because

8   people have different biologies. Some people are more

9   dependent than others. That's reflected in, basically,

10   somebody's genetics that influence, you know, why some

11   people tend to be more addicted than others.

12       Q.   In your opinion, based on your review of the

13   evidence, when did Jackie Loyd become addicted to

14   cigarettes containing nicotine, initially?

15       A.   Well, based on my review of the evidence, you

16   know, the testimony seems to suggest she was smoking

17   regularly at age 16. But there is no doubt, based on

18   the medical records, that certainly date her regular

19   smoking from the early 1950s, around 1953, '54 period.

20   She was clearly smoking a pack a day or more at that

21    time.

22       Q.   Now, did -- at some point in time, did she

23   become a smoker that was actually heavily addicted?

24       A.   She would have been heavily addicted smoking a

25   pack a day. 2692

1        Q.   All right. Now, let's talk about the tests.

2   Let's look first at the "Heaviness of Smoking" slide,

3   slide No. 27.

4            What is this Heaviness of Smoking Index and

5   where does it come from and how do you use it?

6       A.   Sure.

7       Q.   In kind of a summary, tell the jury about it.

8       A.   It's pretty simple.

9       Q.   Multiple questions.

10       A.   Two questions that we tell doctors to ask their

11   patients, and these questions have been --

12       Q.   Excuse me. Two questions you tell doctors?

13   What do you mean?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=111
14       A.   Medical doctors. When we teach them, you know,

15   if you want to assess how addicted or dependent your

16   smoker -- you know, your smoking patients are, ask them

17   these two questions. And these have been culled from

18   hundreds of questions. So we got it down to two. And

19   they actually do a very good job predicting the

20   struggles that people have.

21             And we have now done the studies over two

22   decades, so measuring these questions two decades

23   earlier, 20 years before. These questions actually

24   predict who is able to quit, and easily, versus those

25   who, you know, really sort of struggle to quit over the 2693

1   long period. And they're pretty simple.

2            Number one is:  "How soon after you wake up do

3   you smoke your first cigarette?"

4            And there is a little scoring system there.

5   Within five minutes, you get the most points. Within a

6   half an hour, 5 to -- 5 minutes to 30 minutes,

7   basically, you get a 2. If you can wait an hour or

8   longer, you get a zero on that score.

9            And then "How many cigarettes do you smoke per

10   day?"

11            We just, you know, again, rank and score by the

12   amount that somebody smokes. If they're smoking, you

13   know, a pack and a half or more per day, you're

14   basically scored at a 3. And then you can see how it

15   goes down from there. And then you add those two

16   together and, you know, you get a zero-to-6 scale.

17            I think I mentioned this yesterday. Based on

18   my review of the evidence, I scored Jackie either a 5 or

19   6 depending on, you know, her amount smoked, because

20   there was some variation in the testimony from a pack up

21    to two packs.

22            So he scored her a 2 on amount smoked. There

23   was evidence that she smoked right away when she got up

24   in the morning. Also evidence that she smoked right

25   when she got up, if she woke up in the middle of the 2694

1   night. So I scored her a 3. So she would have been in

2   the high-dependence category.

3            So this isn't telling you whether she's

4   addicted or not. This is, among an addicted person, how

5   dependent are you, because there's individual variation.

6       Q.   But you've already established in this case

7   that she was addicted, obviously?

8       A.   Correct.

9       Q.   So this just tells you how addicted she was?

10       A.   That's right.

11        Q.   And is there another test that's widely used by

12   people who are involved in patients who are addicted

13   that have been used for quite some time and that was

14   designed for the purposes to determine the level of

15   nicotine addiction of smokers?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=112
16       A.   Sure. You know, Fagerstrom Tolerance Scale.

17            MR. UITERWYK: PT--pull it back up.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   PT-2326, which has already been received in

20   evidence.

21        A.   Right.

22            MR. UITERWYK: Let me offer it because --

23       Judge, I'm going to offer this Fagerstrom test for

24       nicotine dependence as PT-2326.

25            THE COURT: I don't recall whether there were 2695

1        objections to this one.

2            MR. WALKER: None to the demonstrative, Judge.

3       I don't know that we've seen the actual exhibit.

4            MR. UITERWYK: Well, the exhibit is the same as

5       the demonstrative, Judge.

6            THE COURT: Okay. The exhibit will be received

7       in evidence.

8            (Plaintiffs Exhibit No. PT-2326 admitted in

9       evidence.)

10   BY MR. UITERWYK:

11        Q.   All right. Now, what is the test, briefly?

12   Because we've got a lot of territory to cover.

13       A.   Carl Fagerstrom, he's a psychologist who was

14   involved in the early development of nicotine

15   replacement products, mainly the nicotine gum. Out of

16   Sweden. He developed this little, you know,

17   questionnaire basically to administer to patients to

18   again assist doctors in, you know, determining the level

19   of nicotine dependence.

20            You can see that two of the items on --

21        Q.   Before you go to the item, let me talk to you a

22   little bit about the test.

23            Who uses this test?

24       A.   This has been widely used by doctors in

25   assessing nicotine dependence. It was initially 2696

1    distributed to doctors in the 1980s when they first

2   introduced nicotine gum here in the United States as a

3   prescription product in 1984.

4       Q.   All right. And is it widely accepted within

5   the scientific community?

6       A.   Sure. It's been examined and validated much

7   like the Heaviness of Smoking Index. And the Heaviness

8   of Smoking Index actually is a little bit more reliable

9   and simple because most of the variance or -- when you

10   separate out, people are accounted for two items; that

11    is, how much you smoke and smoke first thing in the

12   morning.

13       Q.   All right. And is it more widely accepted,

14   based on your experience and your research in this area,

15   than the Diagnostic Statistic Manual, DSM?

16       A.   Yeah. DSM has a lot of problems. That's the

17   Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. There are various

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=113
18   versions that have come out. We're in Version IV. They

19   have a new version that will be coming out in May,

20   Version V.

21        Q.   Let's not talk about the newer versions. Let's

22   not talk about --

23       A.   Sure. But that has criteria for diagnosing

24   drug dependence as well, including nicotine dependence.

25   The problems are that they're highly subjective. 2697

1            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Relevance.

2            THE COURT: Overruled.

3            THE WITNESS: The problem is, they're highly

4       subjective, so it's not as reliable.

5            So if you have three or four doctors using DSM

6       criteria, you may get different answers; whereas,

7       just asking these questions, you know, there's

8       usually no dispute about how much somebody is

9       smoking and whether they're smoking first thing in

10       the morning.

11             So it tends to be more reliable and objective

12       and, it turns out, has greater validity in

13       predicting outcomes than the DSM. But I'm, you

14       know, familiar with all of these.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   Which one do you use? In the 10,000 smokers in

17   cessation clinics, hotlines, and all of the experience

18   that you've had in this field, which one do you use?

19       A.   The one I recommend that the doctors use is the

20   Heaviness of Smoking Index, because they're always

21    asking patients about how much they smoke, because that

22   gives them an idea of the risk that the patient has.

23            And, you know, the odd question about -- you

24   know, when you smoke first thing in the morning seems a

25   little odd. That item actually is the best single 2698

1   predictor of the struggles that people have quitting,

2   because it really relates to the -- if we were doing

3   blood measures of nicotine in people on a regular basis,

4   then it actually maps on to the differences and the

5   amount of nicotine that people get, which is influenced

6   by biology, as I said, because some people metabolize

7   nicotine faster than others.

8       Q.   All right. Let's go over quickly the test as

9   it relates to Jackie Loyd and see where she ranks.

10       A.   To do it on this one? Well, I've already

11    scored her on No. 1 as a 3.

12       Q.   And that's based on evidence that you have

13   reviewed in this case?

14       A.   That's right.

15       Q.   Okay.

16       A.   Obviously, she's not -- was not available to

17   answer these questions, which would be optimum, so we're

18   basing it on the secondary sources that we have.

19       Q.   Is that unusual, that you'd need to do it in

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=114
20   situations where someone -- you know, where you've got

21    to review a case to see whether somebody was addicted?

22       A.   Well, not in a lot of the cases that I've been

23   involved with, because most times the individual, you

24   know, is deceased.

25       Q.   Right. 2699

1        A.   And in some instances and some of the studies

2   we've done, we also ask family members about some of

3   these smoking histories when we're doing research to try

4   to evaluate their exposures and how that relates to

5   disease. So I have done some research looking at the

6   ability of family members to recall information. But,

7   you know, things like that, asking, "Do you find it

8   difficult to refrain from smoking in places where it's

9   forbidden?"

10            There was testimony in this case that Jackie

11    did, you know, get up from the restaurants and go out

12   and smoke. That was an example of where later in her

13   smoking career, you know, restrictions started to appear

14   in public places where you couldn't smoke. Before that,

15   during most of her lifetime, there were no restrictions

16   really. The restrictions on smoking really are a

17   relatively new thing beginning, for the most part, in

18   the late '80s and continuing through today.

19            But you could score, you know, a 1 there or

20   just skip it. You know, "Which cigarette would you hate

21    most to give up?" In the morning, you know, or other.

22   You get a score of 1 if it's in the morning. That item,

23   I can't score, because you really have to ask the smoker

24   that. I don't think the family members can really tell

25   you that information based on my interpretation. 2700

1             "How many cigarettes per day?" There was

2   records there. I would score her either a 2 or a 3 here

3   based on the testimony.

4            "Do you smoke more frequently during the first

5   hours after waking than during the rest of the day?"

6   There was no evidence that I saw in this case that

7   allows me to answer that question.

8            So if we were actually tracking her smoking

9   and, you know, recording it literally right behind

10   her -- and there are studies that have done this -- we

11    find that people who smoke, you know, right away, again

12   they're replenishing the nicotine in their system, you

13   do find some -- you get a score of 1 there. But I can't

14   score it.

15            And "Do you smoke even if you are ill?" Well,

16   there was evidence of her smoking even while ill.

17   Certainly, she was having very pretty serious health

18   problems in the late, you know -- or early 1990s. And

19   her husband even said when she got ill with a cold, she

20   cut back, but she wouldn't quit. That's pretty, you

21   know, good indication of smoking while ill.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=115
22            So I would score her a, you know -- basically,

23   a 1. To be conservative about it, a 2 on a not smoke, a

24   3 on within five minutes, and a 1 on, you know, refrain,

25   based on the restaurant example. And there was also 2701

1   testimony that she had to smoke every two to three

2   hours. So I give her a 1 there. So a 7.

3            So she's still falling -- even on this scale,

4   even with missing data, she's still in the high

5   dependence. So, I mean, it's just showing you these

6   different measures give you pretty much the same answer.

7       Q.   And does this -- does this particular test

8   refer that when your level of dependence is 7, which is

9   high dependence, you aren't in control of your smoking;

10   it is control -- and it's in control with you, when you

11    make decision to quit, you may want to talk with your

12   doctor about nicotine replacement therapy or other

13   medication to help you break the addiction? Did I read

14   that right?

15       A.   Yeah. And she did.

16       Q.   All right. And that was when?

17       A.   Well, I believe the medical record, as I

18   recall, was --1 think it was '93 that talks about the

19   use of Nicotrol. And there was some, I believe, earlier

20   medical records that talked about her getting advice

21    from the doctor to stop smoking.

22       Q.   And let's look at the -- let me ask you

23   something. Was nicotine replacement therapy available

24   in the '50s, '60s, '70s, and early '80s?

25       A.   No. I mean, the nicotine replacement therapy, 2702

1   the gum, became available in 1984 as a prescription

2   product. That was the first FDA-approved medication for

3   stop smoking.

4            There were some over-the-counter kinds of aids

5   that were available, like filter systems and so on. And

6   there's some evidence she used a filter system,

7   actually.

8       Q.   All right. But during the vast majority of her

9   smoking career, was there any nicotine replacement

10   therapy like that which is recommended on this

11    Fagerstrom?

12       A.   No. Patch came out in December 1992.

13       Q.   And she first had the -- patch came out in

14   December '92. And she had the patch in --

15       A.   '93. So right away. Shortly after the patch

16   became --

17       Q.   When did you say the patch came out?

18       A.   December of 1992. I know that because it was

19   hard to get when the patch first came out. They ran out

20   of supplies, there was such demand for it. And so the

21    companies actually didn't have enough to provide. So a

22   lot of drugstores didn't have it to fulfill the

23   prescriptions that were being written.

24       Q.   All right. This slide that we've got here

25   titled "Pharmaceutical Quit Aids," is this basically a 2703

1    description of the primary nicotine replacement therapy

2   or aids or medication that was -- that had been

3   available? And we'll discuss how long.

4       A.   Yeah, these are the FDA approved ones. There's

5   also a nicotine lozenge, a nicotine inhaler, and a

6   nicotine spray, actually. The inhaler and spray are

7   still prescription. The lozenge, the gum, and the patch

8   are now available over the counter in a drugstore, so

9   you don't need a prescription. That was 1996 that

10   happened.

11             Chantix is a pill that -- it's better known an

12   Varenicline. Is a prescription product that came out in

13   2006. And it is designed to specifically affect those

14   receptor sites where nicotine tends to bind in the

15   brain.

16       Q.   And then is there side effects with Chantix?

17       A.   There some side effects with it. The main side

18   effect is problem sleeping, but it also has -- can

19   create some mood disorders.

20            Some people -- because you actually are

21    affecting those neurotransmitters in the brain, some

22   people have suicidal thoughts as a result of using that.

23   So that's a warning on the product. So they like to do

24   a mental health screen on people before they, you know,

25   give that particular drug. 2704

1        Q.   And briefly, what is Zyban/Wellbutrin, which I

2   believe are two of the same drugs, right?

3       A.   They are. Wellbutrin has been around as a

4   antidepressant for a long time. The drug is bupropion.

5   And Wellbutrin and Zyban are essentially the same drug.

6            The drug Zyban is the one that has the

7   indication for quitting smoking. That came out as a

8   prescription for quitting smoking. It was approved for

9   that indication in 1997.

10       Q.   Were any of these drugs in the top tier

11    available prior to December of 1993?

12       A.   No.

13       Q.   And you mentioned the patch was first available

14   by prescription in December of 1992?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   And was it very expensive when it came out?

17       A.   Sure. Prescription drugs are more expensive

18   typically than the over-the-counter versions.

19       Q.   And then Nicorette gum, when did that come out?

20       A.   That was a prescription in 1984, and then it

21    went over-the-counter in 1996.

22       Q.   Again, when it was available by prescription,

23   was it very expensive during that time?

24            MR. WALKER: Objection. Relevance.

25            THE COURT: Sir, I didn't hear your objection.

2705

1            MR. WALKER: Relevance.

2            THE COURT: Overruled.

3            THE WITNESS: Yeah, the typical cost of a

4       prescription for nicotine gum was about 40 or 50

5       dollars for a two-week supply.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   All right. Now, we've talked about this, but

8   is nicotine addiction a condition or is it a process or

9   combination of both?

10       A.   Is it a -- well, you get -- there's a process

11    of becoming addicted.

12       Q.   Okay.

13       A.   So people just don't, you know, smoke a

14   cigarette and, boom, they're addicted.

15       Q.   Let's -- sorry. Go ahead.

16       A.   It usually takes, you know, some learning,

17   which is what I think I had explained yesterday. We use

18   a marker of 100 cigarettes smoked in your lifetime.

19   That seems to be the tipping point.

20            Of course, there are some -- that's an average.

21    So some people don't need to smoke that many. Some

22   people probably, as we've seen with chippers, they can

23   smoke a lot of cigarettes and probably don't have, you

24   know, a measure of being addicted to the product.

25       Q.   All right. Let's go -- let's talk --2706

1            MR. UITERWYK: Slide 29, please.

2   BY MR. UITERWYK:

3       Q.   Have you prepared a slide to discuss the

4   concept of choice and how and if it affects an addicted

5   smoker?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   All right. Can you explain to the jury what we

8   are seeing here on this slide? It looks a little

9   complicated, but is it really?

10       A.   I don't think it's that complicated. I mean,

11    essentially on the left side you're talking about

12   diminishing choice. So, you know people -- you know,

13   young children are usually starting to experiment with

14   cigarettes. They do this for a period of time. And,

15   eventually, the act of smoking begins to be controlled

16   by the changes that are occurring in their brain and

17   their need for nicotine.

18            So they transfer from the psychosocial factors

19   that are the main drivers to the reason they pick up

20   smoking to begin with, and it shifts over to, you know,

21    smoking primarily for addiction, the pleasure that you

22   get from getting the dopamine going in your brain, as

23   well as the avoidance of withdrawal that occurs when all

24   of a sudden you stop using the product.

25            And that doesn't happen overnight. But when 2707

1   that happens -- and about a third of the smokers who go

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=118
2   through this experimentation process go on to become

3   addicted smokers as adults.

4            And once you get into the daily use pattern,

5   which is why the criteria that I shared with you

6   yesterday that I use, the first criteria is a pattern of

7   persistent daily use of the drug. It's what you would

8   look at for a drug addict. You know, not somebody who

9   is having a drink every so often, but when you have to

10   drink every day, persistently, you may begin to be in a

11   pattern of having a problem with alcohol. And the same

12   is true with other drugs of abuse. And that's true of

13   nicotine.

14            So persistent daily use and then how heavily

15   you use and the pattern of your use is a reflection of

16   how dependent you are.

17       Q.   There's a circle there in the addiction cycle?

18       A.   Uh-huh. (Indicates affirmatively.)

19       Q.   Can you explain the significance of that circle

20   that you put there?

21        A.   Well, once you've altered your brain, you've

22   rewired literally the neurons, because they're talking

23   to each other and where the neurotransmitters are

24   released, and you need the drug to feel normal now. You

25   try to go without smoking, you begin to feel anxious, 2708

1   nervous, grouchy. You light up a cigarette, you feel

2   better.

3            And people get into this vicious cycle of

4   smoking to avoid withdrawal. So you have what we call,

5   in drug abuse, chronic relapsing disorder. And so --

6   and a lot of people who smoke, the main way they try to

7   limit their smoking is to cut back, switch brands. To

8   switch brands is really -- doesn't do anything, but

9   people think it does. In fact, it's -- that's what my

10   research on people's perceptions of those low-tar and

11    filtered cigarettes, thought they were doing something

12   better for them.

13       Q.   Well, let me ask you a question here. Once a

14   person like Jackie Loyd who got into the addicted

15   cycle -- am I correct?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   Once she got into that addicted cycle and

18   because of the manipulation of the cigarettes continued

19   to smoke and her addiction continued to be maintained by

20   that manipulation, did the manipulation of the product

21    then take over basically constrained choice from that

22   point on?

23            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

24       Argumentative.

25            THE COURT: Sustained. 2709

1   BY MR. UITERWYK:

2       Q.   What happened -- strike that.

3            Once you're addicted, does choice play any part

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=119
4   as to whether or not you're addicted?

5       A.   No. I mean, I call it constrained choice.

6   That's the term that I've actually used, which is

7   that --1 mean, obviously, people try to quit, but the

8   ability to quit and just put it away and walk away from

9   it is constrained by the physical addiction to the drug.

10   And so that's why I call it a constrained choice at that

11   point.

12            So they're smoking for nicotine at that point.

13   That's what a confirmed smoker does. The absence of

14   nicotine, they don't feel normal. And that's, you know,

15   why this is an addictive process rather than one that is

16   just a bad habit that somebody might pick up.

17       Q.   But my question went a little bit further than

18   that. You have addiction over here.

19       A.   Yeah.

20       Q.   And you talk about the choice. And as we see,

21    it diminishes and becomes more constrained.

22       A.   Right.

23       Q.   But once that person is addicted, choice really

24   doesn't make a difference as to whether -- the choice --

25   they're still addicted even though they may have a 2710

1    constrained choice, right?

2            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

3       Argumentative.

4            THE COURT: Sustained.

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   Doctor, do you have an opinion as to whether or

7   not once a person becomes addicted and heavily addicted

8   like Jackie Loyd was, once they get into that addiction

9   cycle, they're addicted, they may have a constrained

10   choice, but are they still addicted, in your opinion?

11             MR. WALKER: Same objection. And asked and

12       answered.

13            THE COURT: Sustained one more time,

14       Mr. Uiterwyk.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   All right. Doctor --

17            THE COURT: Q and A, please, not argument.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   Can you explain how choice and addiction do not

20   merge together?

21        A.   Sure. I mean, once addicted, you're always

22   addicted. And you're just abstaining at that point if

23   you're able to go without having a cigarette. You're

24   still addicted.

25            So once the addiction takes hold, you're always 2711

1    addicted, you're an addict. And that's -- that's just

2   the truth of all drug addictions, by the way. And

3   people are able to overcome drug addiction, but it

4   doesn't mean they're cured from addiction. They're not.

5            Once addicted, always addicted, because you're

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=120
6   changed permanently; structures in your brain, the

7   wiring in the brain. And, you know, that's why it's so

8   easy, that's why it's a relapsing disorder, because

9   people fall back into the addicted pattern again very

10   easily. That's not a choice. That's because of the

11   physical addiction.

12       Q.   Now, I don't know if we talked about -- we did.

13   Pass.

14            Let's talk quickly about --1 don't know if you

15   talked about the last completely free choice. What does

16   that mean?

17       A.   Well, that's during the process, usually during

18   the uptake as it -- since most people go through this

19   process when they're young as teenagers, you know, when

20   they're, you know, smoking really for psychosocial

21    reasons and their behavior isn't being driven by their

22   addiction to nicotine.

23       Q.   And when somebody is -- and what period of

24   time -- did you say 1951 period is when Jackie Loyd was

25   in that last completely free choice period? 2712

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   During that timeframe, the early '50s, where

3   people were in that completely last free choice stage,

4   was information, in your opinion, important during that

5   particular timeframe?

6       A.   Sure. Information would have been important at

7   any timeframe.

8       Q.   During that timeframe, during any time of the

9    1950s, during any time early 1960s, the first 15 years

10   period of time when she was addicted to cigarettes, were

11    there any warning labels?

12            MR. WALKER: Objection. Compound question.

13            THE COURT: Overruled.

14            THE WITNESS: No. Warning labels went on the

15       cigarettes in 1966.

16   BY MR. UITERWYK:

17       Q.   And was there any advertising, publicity, or

18   any information provided by the cigarette companies

19   regarding the fact that you smoke our product, you're

20   going to very well get addicted?

21        A.   No, cigarette companies didn't tell their

22   customers that they would get addicted to the product.

23       Q.   When did they first tell the customers that, if

24   ever?

25       A.   Well, it's never been on the cigarette pack. 2713

1   There's a warning from these defendants, actually, which

2   one company that did it. And that was removed,

3   actually.

4       Q.   Okay. Just talk about these defendants.

5       A.   Sure. But -- so it's never been on the pack.

6   They've acknowledged on their websites. Starting in

7   2000,1 think, Philip Morris changed their website to

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=121
8   say that their -- that cigarette smoking was addictive.

9   And I believe Reynolds and Lorillard changed their

10   websites around 2004.

11        Q.   But before that, did they ever tell the youth

12   of this country, who -- experimental, the replacement

13   smokers, the young teens -- any time, if you start this

14   stuff, you're going to get addicted?

15            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Repetitive.

16       Argumentative.

17            THE COURT: Sustained.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   We talked about --1 just mentioned the term

20   "replacement smokers." Have we received the -- have you

21    seen research documents --

22            MR. UITERWYK: And, Your Honor, I do want to

23       offer into evidence --1 did -- Fagerstrom. I

24       believe you accepted or not?

25            THE COURT: Sir? 2714

1            MR. UITERWYK: The Fagerstrom?

2            MR. TRENTALANGE: It was in.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Huh?

4            MR. TRENT ALANGE: It was in.

5            MR. UITERWYK: It was in? Okay.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Let's go to the next exhibit, PT-3400. And

8   this going on discussion we had regarding the

9   replacement smokers.

10            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. This

11        document's not in evidence. It shouldn't be

12       published at this point.

13            MR. UITERWYK: All right.

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   Are you familiar with the document 3400?

16       A.   I am.

17       Q.   And tell the jury -

18            THE COURT: What tab number do you have?

19            MR. UITERWYK: Tab, Your Honor?

20            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Is 35.

22            THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

23            MR. UITERWYK: I thought it was.

24            May we approach, Your Honor?

25            (At the bench.) 2715

1            MR. UITERWYK: This is a document that I handed

2       up to you yesterday when we talked about youth

3       smoking and youth marketing, and we discussed it at

4       length. You said I'm going to admit these

5       documents.

6            THE COURT: I don't remember specifically,

7       but --

8            MR. WALKER: My notes reflect that with respect

9       to this and several other documents, Your Honor

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=122
10       required that a predicate be laid. And that hasn't

11        happened. He just put it on the screen.

12            MR. UITERWYK: I don't remember a predicate

13       being laid. This is an RJR document. I mean, I

14       don't think --1 don't think there is predicate laid

15       on this issue. If you want to, I'll go through the

16       motion.

17            THE COURT: Okay. Just lay some predicate and

18       then --

19            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, while we're here, I

20       don't think Mr. Uiterwyk does it intentionally, but

21        he does have a tendency to ask his questions towards

22       the jury, which I understand is something you didn't

23       want us to do. If I can't do it, he shouldn't do

24       it.

25            THE COURT: That's true, and I did -2716

1            MR. UITERWYK: I've been so bad, Your Honor.

2            THE COURT: I know.

3            MR. WALKER: In addition, Judge, he's been

4       referring to Mrs. Loyd as "Jackie Loyd," and I had

5       understood that we weren't doing that either.

6            THE COURT: Well, I don't --1 think that's

7       okay if you refer to somebody by their first and

8       last name. Just that you don't refer to somebody by

9       their first name.

10            MR. WALKER: A nickname is -- because he's

11        using a nickname that --

12            MR. UITERWYK: I think Jackie Loyd. You want

13       to call her Jacqueline Loyd?

14            THE COURT: I don't -- well, I don't -- the

15       rule is primarily designed to -- as I understand it,

16       to prevent people initially from genderized

17       primarily. I mean, we refer to males as

18        "Mr. Walker" but females as "Susan," and that's

19       totally inappropriate and --

20            MR. UITERWYK: I didn't know that.

21             THE COURT: Yeah.

22            MR. WALKER: I didn't appreciate that was the

23       concern, Judge. Now I understand.

24            THE COURT: Frankly, even people with different

25       ethnicity, maybe sort of like manners, Mr. Jones and 2717

1       black men by their first names would, likewise, be

2       totally inappropriate.

3            But if you refer to somebody as Jackie Loyd or

4       Jackie Robinson, for that matter, I don't think that

5       would be violative of the rule.

6            MR. PEDROSA: Thank you, Your Honor.

7            MR. WALKER: Very well, Judge.

8            MR. PEDROSA: Thank you.

11        Q.   All right. If we could, Doctor, before we put

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=123
12   it on the screen, refer to PT-3400.

13            What's the title of that document?

14       A.   "Younger Adult Smoker Strategies and

15   Opportunities."

16       Q.   And is this a document that you -- one of the

17   documents that you obtained through your research of all

18   this information?

19       A.   It is.

20       Q.   And from what company is that document?

21        A.   R.J.Reynolds.

22       Q.   And who is the author of that document?

23       A.   Diane Burrows.

24       Q.   And who is Diane Burrows?

25       A.   It's a market analyst at R.J. Reynolds. 2718

1        Q.   And the subject matter of that document is

2   what?

3       A.   Basically, doing a 50-year lookback at the

4   brands that were popular with younger smokers as their

5   first usual brand that they would select and purchase.

6            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Your Honor, I'm

7       going to offer and introduce in evidence PT-3400.

8            MR. WALKER: No new objections, Your Honor.

9            THE COURT: It will be received in evidence.

10            (Plaintiffs Exhibit No. PT-3400 admitted in

11    evidence.)

12            MR. UITERWYK: If we put it up on the screen,

13       please.

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   Now, at the top of that document there is a

16   term "Secret."

17            Do you see that, Doctor?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   Is that unusual that you see the word "Secret"

20   and "Confidential" on many of the documents that you

21    have reviewed in connection with your review of all the

22   industry documents?

23       A.   Well, it's not unusual. I've had other

24   documents that carry, you know, a label, "Secret,"

25    "Confidential," those kinds of things stamped onto the 2719

1    document.

2       Q.   All right. What is the date of this document?

3       A.   This is December of 1984 --or February.

4   Excuse me. February 29th, 1984.

5       Q.   Okay. And this refers to 1984.

6            Over what period was this study -- does the

7   study cover?

8            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. The

9       document speaks for itself.

10            THE COURT: Overruled.

11             THE WITNESS: Covers the 50-year period back

12       from 1984.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=124
14       Q.   1934, you mean?

15       A.   So 1934 up to 1984.

16       Q.   I got it. Because I'm saying -- it's not 50

17   years since 1994, so -- okay. Sorry. I misunderstood

18   you.

19            MR. UITERWYK: And if we could look at that

20       document, please, Baron.

21    BY MR. UITERWYK:

22       Q.   Now, does it refer in there to replacement, the

23   importance -- or "replacement smokers" at any point?

24       A.   It does.

25       Q.   Under "Volume," what does it say there, Doctor? 2720

1        A.   Well, it says "Volume. Younger adult smokers

2   are the only source of replacement smokers." And then

3   they refer to an Appendix B.

4       Q.   And what are they state -- well, we'll talk

5   about Appendix B.

6            And what is it your research studies have

7   shown, what they were referring to when they said

8   "replacement smokers"?

9            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. All Cases

10       ruling on meaning and intent.

11             THE COURT: Sustained.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   All right. Did you testify earlier, Doctor,

14   that the term "replacement smokers" is used within the

15   industry?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   And did you -- has your research shown as to

18   what they were referring to in connection with the term

19    "replacement smokers"?

20            MR. WALKER: Same objection.

21             THE COURT: Overruled.

22            THE WITNESS: Yes.

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   What was that?

25       A.   Basically, 12- to 24-year-olds. 2721

1        Q.   All right. Now, Doctor, that refers you to the

2   Appendix B; does it not?

3       A.   Right.

4       Q.   And let's look at, I believe, page 65. And on

5   top of that, what does it say?

6       A.   Title of it is, "Younger Adults Importance as

7   Replacement Smokers."

8       Q.   And what did they -- and whose words are those?

9       A.   Well, the title is from -- this document is

10   R.J. Reynolds. Diane Burrows is the author. It was

11    sent to the president of the company, Gerald Long, and

12   to the vice president for marketing, Martin Orlowsky.

13       Q.   And what did they determine in this? What

14   information did they obtain from this?

15       A.   Well, they determined that -- you know, here

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=125
16   they're citing a government survey that's indicating

17   that, you know, most smokers begin as teenagers. And

18   this is looking at uptake on a regular basis about -- as

19   you can see here, about 69 percent or so begin regular

20   smoking by the age of 18. And the median was 16.7.

21    They report similar results for females in the next

22   paragraph.

23       Q.   Yeah, let's look at that. What did they say

24   about females?

25       A.   And here's, you know, comparing different birth 2722

1    cohorts over time. They're looking at -- although women

2   of the early 1900s started smoking slightly later in age

3   as men did, they were beginning to catch up over time.

4   And then they're presenting the data for the different

5   birth cohorts for women. And you can see, you know,

6   those born in the 1930s, the average age of smoking

7   initiation, or median age, was 17.7. In the 1940s,

8    17.1. Of course, those ages have dropped and they're

9   almost identical between boys and girls today.

10       Q.   What has your research shown as to why they

11    were researching the teens as replacement smokers?

12            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning

13       and intent ruling.

14            THE COURT: Overruled.

15            THE WITNESS: Well, this document is very clear

16       about that. They say the reason they were studying

17       this is because that was the only source of

18       replacement smokers, and it was critical to the

19       profitability of brands and the companies that sold

20       those brands to get their share of the youth market.

21        And if they didn't do that, the brands would age out

22       and their profitability would go away.

23            And they provided examples of this very thing

24       happening with different popular brands that had

25       arisen with youth, and then had not successfully, 2723

1        you know, gone back and gotten younger smokers. So

2       they present stories on Pall Mall cigarettes,

3       Winston cigarettes, Marlboro, Kool cigarettes in

4       this analysis.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Winston. You mentioned it. I'm

6       not sure what Bates number it is. I know it's

7       there. I just don't remember the Bates number now.

8            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, while he's looking for

9       that, may we approach on this issue?

10            THE COURT: Okay.

11             (At the bench.)

12            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, this is exactly the

13       problem that Judge Barton's order is intended to

14       address. He's sitting there. The document has

15       already been admitted into evidence. And instead of

16       actually using the document or allowing the jury to

17       draw its own conclusions about what this document

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=126
18       says, he's asking this witness to summarize,

19       essentially as an advocate, what he thinks the

20       document means and what the companies were doing

21       based on what it says.

22            THE COURT: Well, maybe the better question

23       might be -- and let me find out what your

24       objection -- hopefully, you won't have an objection

25       to what I'm going to say, but --2724

1            MR. WALKER: I would never object to anything

2       you would say, Judge.

3            THE COURT: Anyway, I've heard that before.

4            MR. UITERWYK: I'll remind you of that.

5            THE COURT: Yeah.

6            But he is an expert. He can rely upon these

7       documents in forming an opinion. And I think

8       perhaps a more appropriate question is:  "After

9       reviewing this document, do you have an opinion

10       regarding what the defendants were doing with

11        respect to the issue about replacement smokers?"

12       And his answer would be, "Yes. Yes, I have an

13       opinion."  "And what is that opinion?"

14            I think he can base his opinion on, obviously,

15       the documents that are in evidence as opposed to

16       summarizing for the jury what the document says.

17            And as to that question, do you believe you

18       would have an objection to that question?

19            MR. WALKER: Not based on Judge Barton's order,

20       Judge, no. No, not based on Judge Barton's order.

21        I think that--

22            THE COURT: You have any objection?

23            MR. WALKER: As you have phrased it, I don't

24       think so. There may be some questions that I think

25       will be beyond his qualification -- is beyond his 2725

1        expertise.

2            THE COURT: Do you have an objection?

3            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, this is not my

4       document. It's Mr. Walker's document.

5            THE COURT: Okay. That's true.

6            MR. PEDROSA: I think there will certainly be

7       objections, because we've already heard these. Now

8       he's saying --

9            THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk, I think those are the

10       better questions after reviewing these documents,

11        and you can phrase it like that in terms of whether

12       he's stating an opinion regarding the documents in

13       his field of expertise as opposed to just, well, the

14       documents says this, the document says that. He can

15       use it in forming the basis of his opinion and say

16       why he's using it.

17            MR. UITERWYK: I understand the Court's

18       instruction in that regard, and I'll abide by it.

19       The only issue, Judge, we're looking at one

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=127
20       document. He has studied thousands of documents.

21        And if we put up all the documents, we'd be here for

22       months instead of weeks.

23            THE COURT: We may do that anyway.

24            MR. UITERWYK: And what I'm asking is -- he's

25       done his research. What I was asking for is, based 2726

1        on your experience and research and study of this

2       issue within this area, what have you seen as to

3       what use they make of this information that they

4       studied. That's what my question was. And, I mean,

5       it wasn't objected. And that's what he'd answered

6       it.

7            THE COURT: Well --

8            MR. UITERWYK: I'll try your way.

9            THE COURT: Okay.

10            MR. PEDROSA: I just want to make sure that -

11        you know, Mr. Uiterwyk may pose the question that

12       way, but if the opinion comes out, well, my opinion

13       is that what Ms. Burrows is saying is "X," that's --

14       that's the same thing as -- and I'm worried that

15       that's exactly what's going to happen.

16            THE COURT: Well, I'll have to see at the time.

17       But see if you can phrase the question a little bit

18       differently.

19            MR. UITERWYK: I'll do it.

20            THE COURT: Okay.

21             MR. UITERWYK: I don't think there is a

22       question pending.

23            THE COURT: Pardon me?

24            MR. UITERWYK: I don't think there is a

25       question pending. 2727

1            THE COURT: No.

2            (In open court.)

3   BY MR. UITERWYK:

4       Q.   Now, this particular slide refers to the

5    "Successful First Brand Strategies of the Past." And --

6            MR. WALKER: May we have a page reference. I'm

7       sorry.

8            MR. UITERWYK: Bates number?

9            MR. PHILIPSON: Page No. 8, Bates --

10            MR. WALKER: Thank you.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   And this is under Roman numeral II; is it not?

13       A.   Correct. Under the heading "Successful First

14   Brand Strategies of the Past."

15       Q.   And read that portion of the -- that you feel

16   is significant with regard to your opinions in this

17   matter, Doctor.

18       A.   Well, it says in their studying, "In their 1983

19   segment description studies, smokers of all ages were

20   asked what brand they smoked when they were

21    18 years old. By using these responses to represent the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=128
22   younger adult market of the past, the rise and fall of

23   key younger adult brands over the last 50 years can be

24   analyzed. By linking these brand trends in time to

25   demographic social marketing changes, insights into the 2728

1   factors which affected those brands and might affect a

2   younger adult brand today can be gained. This section

3   traces every brand which has risen to a 10 percent or

4   higher market share among the 18-year-old smokers since

5   the 1930s. There have been only six. They include the

6   major brands of the last half century; Pall Mall,

7   Winston, Marlboro, Kool, Salem, and Newport."

8            So they present analyses of each of those.

9       Q.   All right. And did they, in fact, look

10   specifically at Winston? Page 85.

11        A.   Yes, they do. It's on page 12 of the document.

12       Q.   Page 85 under the appendix.

13       A.   Okay. It's actually page 12 of this section.

14       Q.   Okay. Oh, in this section, page 12?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   All right. I missed that. Got it.

17            This talks about Winston; does it not?

18       A.   It does.

19       Q.   And what did they state with regard to the hit

20   of the '50s and the '60s and the external influence in

21    the '50s that contributed to the Winston opportunity?

22       A.   They said, "The rising tide of health insurance

23   which peaked with the cancer scare of 1954, so although

24   modern-filtered cigarettes have been in the U.S. market

25   since 1936, their market importance was almost nil until 2729

1   the early 1950s when Viceroy sales quadrupled in less

2   than two years.

3             "Reynolds, determined not to repeat its

4   experience introducing Cavalier against an already too

5   well-entrenched Pall Mall, rushed Winston to market in

6   March of 1954 near the crest of the health scare. With

7   the spread of television, Winston was introduced on TV,

8   a fad that spread from 90 percent of the households in

9   the 1950s to 87 percent by the 1960s. Advertising

10   dollars were a key advantage for Winston over its filter

11    competitors, and the bulk of those dollars were used to

12   leverage TV."

13            And if you look at the bottom chart, it will

14   show you the brand share for Winston over that time

15   period.

16       Q.   Go ahead.

17       A.   And as you can see, the overall market share

18   for Winston, which is the solid line, that's of all

19   smokers of all ages. And you can see the dashed line

20   which shows the rapid rise of Winston -- excuse me -- of

21   Winston cigarettes among the 18-year-old -- 18 is -- 18

22   and under share that you're seeing.

24       and intent. Move to strike.

25            THE COURT: Overruled. 2730

1   BY MR. UITERWYK:

2       Q.   Go ahead.

3       A.   So you're seeing the -- largely, that share

4   growth of Winston was driven by, you know, younger

5   smokers taking up that brand.

6            And then they summarize the success of Winston

7   on page 15 in their summary points, what drove Winston

8   to become the best-selling cigarette in the

9   United States, and the best-selling cigarette smoked by

10   teenagers in the United States.

11        Q.   And was this in 1954 timeframe?

12       A.   1954.

13            They go all the way -- because you saw it go up

14   and then go down. Winston started to lose its market

15   share, particularly among young people, in the 1970s and

16   '80s as people began to switch to other brands as that

17   age cohort that had picked up Winston began to age out

18   of the market.

19       Q.   Based on your review of the document and your

20   study of the industry, were they designing the

21    cigarettes and the ads to appeal to that youth market

22   that they were studying in this particular Exhibit 3400?

23       A.   Yes, these were the key points they found.

24   They picked up the benefit from the health scares.

25       Q.   What do you mean by "the benefit from the 2731

1   health scares"?

2       A.   Well, early information was beginning to come

3   out on the health risks of smoking and was accumulated

4   in the early 1950s, and Winston was there with a

5   solution, a filtered cigarette that would taste good

6   like a cigarette should. So it was favorable timing, as

7   they indicated, when they introduced the filtered

8   cigarette.

9            And younger smokers, they found, were more

10   likely than older ones to become the adopters of

11   Winston. So they took on that brand rather than smoking

12   the brands of older people.

13            You know, Lucky Strike, Camel, those were the

14   predominant brands that were popular among the general

15   population at that time. Peer pressure, the bandwagon

16   effect. So as teens picked it up, that became the peer

17   brand.

18       Q.   What do you mean by "peer brand"?

19       A.   Just like teenagers today, you know, the

20   popular brand of jeans or music or whatever, the fad for

21    cigarettes has followed this bandwagon effect. And

22   brands that have been successful in picking up younger

23   smokers have been sort of the in brand. Winston was the

24   in brand in the '50s and '60s among teenagers and young

25   adults.

2732

1        Q.   Let's go on, if we could, Doctor.

2            You talked about peer pressure and what's going

3   on. Does the environment that someone is in, an

4   addicted smoker, impact both their starting smoking as

5   well as their ability to stop smoking?

6       A.   Sure.

7       Q.   And let's look at some slides that I believe

8   the jury saw very briefly during opening as to some of

9   the areas where -- and this is slide 32 and 33. Let's

10   refer to 32. Some of the areas in the '50s where people

11    smoked and even after that.

12            First of all, did they have any regulations as

13   to where you could smoke and not smoke in the '50s?

14       A.   No.

15       Q.   Did they have any regulations as to smoking in

16   courtrooms?

17       A.   No.

18       Q.   Smoking in airplanes?

19       A.   No.

20            In fact, you know, the defendants here -- it

21    was Reynolds, I know -- had agreements with some of the

22   airlines.

23            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Relevance,

24       unfair prejudice.

25            THE COURT: Sustained. 2733

1   BY MR. UITERWYK:

2       Q.   All right. Did they -- did they give out

3   cigarettes on the airlines?

4       A.   Yes. That's what I was trying to say.

5       Q.   Okay. What cigarettes did they give out?

6       A.   Well, they'd give out Winston cigarettes,

7   usually little sample cigarettes. They were in like

8   four-packs.

9            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Relevance,

10       unfair prejudice.

11             THE COURT: Overruled.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   And did they give them out to the passengers as

14   they were getting on the plane?

15       A.   They would give them out to the passengers,

16   actually, usually when they would serve a meal on a

17   plane.

18       Q.   And did people smoke the cigarettes on the

19   airplanes?

20       A.   Yes, they did.

21        Q.   Did they smoke them in trains?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   Did the doctors smoke in hospitals?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   All right. And do we see some of these 2734

1   pictures here at the time, hospitals, schools, did they

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=131
2   smoke in?

3       A.   Sure.

4       Q.   In the legislature?

5       A.   Right.

6       Q.   Was it -- so what about this environment --

7            MR. UITERWYK: Let's look at the next slide, if

8       we could, Baron.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Nurses, coaches, orchestras, priest and clergy,

11    golfing, traveling. I mean, we don't have that

12   environment today, do we?

13       A.   No, it's very different. I mean, those --

14   these pictures come from the '50s and '60s. And so

15   there were really no restrictions where people would

16   smoke. It was very common to have smoking, you know, on

17   airplanes, in stores.

18            You had about close to 60 percent of men

19   smoking in the early '50s. It was about 26 percent of

20   women who were smoking. So the average prevalence of

21    smoking was about 44 percent or so. So half of all

22   people largely were cigarette smokers. So it was a

23   pretty common practice. And it was growing among women

24   at that -- you know, from the 1950s onward.

25       Q.   Do we see today that, you know, it's kind of 2735

1   like ostracized actually when you light up a cigarette

2   with somebody around? Do you have any of that during

3   the timeframe that Jackie started smoking, during the

4   timeframe that she was addicted up until the early '90s?

5            THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk.

6            MR. UITERWYK: Excuse me.

7            THE COURT: Approach.

8            MR. UITERWYK: I know, Judge. I got it. All

9       right.

10            THE COURT: Okay. Everybody's to be referred

11        in this courtroom by their surname. It's improper

12       to refer to anybody by their first name. And so

13       I've instructed counsel to do that. Please comply

14       with my order.

15            MR. UITERWYK: Thank you, Your Honor. Sorry.

16   BY MR. UITERWYK:

17       Q.   Did there -- was it anything like that, as

18   compared to today, like it's ostracized today when you

19   go somewhere and smoke, in the time that Jackie Loyd was

20   starting to smoke, continued to smoke, and smoked and

21    was addicted?

22       A.   No, it's very different today. The social

23   norms about smoking have changed dramatically today.

24   So, you know, now you're restricted where you work,

25   going into restaurants, bars, on airplanes, on public 2736

1   transportation. So that's -- that's a recent

2   phenomenon, and it's one of the reasons that smoking

3   rates have dramatically changed in this country.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=132
4       Q.   I think it depends on your age as to whether

5   you define it as recent or not, so --

6       A.   Well, I guess I'm giving my age.

7       Q.   It's relative.

8            We've talked some about quitting. And let me

9   change directions for a moment.

10            Did the fact that someone gets addicted to

11    nicotine mean that they can never quit?

12       A.   No.

13            MR. UITERWYK: Could we have slide 29?

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   And does the fact that someone still meets the

16   definition --

17            MR. UITERWYK: I don't want that. That's not

18       the one I want. Go back.

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   Does the fact that someone still meets the

21    definition, even if they -- of addicted -- even if they

22   do quit eventually?

23       A.   No. I mean, basically, the answer would be no.

24   The fact that somebody is addicted doesn't mean they

25   can't quit, and many people are over -- are able to 2737

1    overcome their nicotine addiction. And that has changed

2   over time as more and more people quit. But the factors

3   that predict quitting are different than those that

4   predict sustaining staying off cigarettes. And nicotine

5   addiction is the factor that really makes it hard to

6   sustain staying off. That's where we see the individual

7   variability.

8            The information environment, you know,

9   what you -- and the social environment you're in

10   certainly influences whether people are trying to quit.

11    So many more people are trying to quit today than they

12   were, you know, back in the 1950s. And, really, not

13   many people at all were trying to quit back then.

14       Q.   All right. Let's talk about that.

15            MR. UITERWYK: That's not what I wanted.

16       Slide 34, please.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   Have you studied the number of current smokers

19   in a given year who try and quit and stay quit for that

20   given year and then relapse and then fail?

21        A.   Yes.

22            MR. UITERWYK: 34.

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   And do you have a slide that would illustrate

25   that to the jury? 2738

1        A.   This is -- this is, you know, relatively recent

2   statistics that are showing you the number of smokers in

3   the population today. That's vastly different than what

4   it used to be. Still 45 million people are smokers.

5            If you ask them at a point in time, about 70

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=133
6   percent of them, about seven out of ten will say that

7   they wish they could quit now. So -- and then about

8   half of those people will make a quit attempt in a given

9   year. That's today.

10            And -- but when you follow out all those

11   people, eventually over a year, among those who quit and

12   are able to sustain staying off for at least a year or

13   more, it's about 3 percent. So there's a lot of

14   quitting, and most of it ends up as relapse back to

15   smoking.

16            And so the typical smoker is, you know, usually

17   asked to make multiple attempts. Anywhere from 10 to 12

18   attempts is not uncommon. And, in fact, a lot of failed

19   attempts is an indicator of stronger nicotine

20   dependence.

21        Q.   So is it -- there's 97 percent of the people

22   who try to quit relapse?

23       A.   That's right. You can -- you can alter that

24   statistic a little bit with the use of medications

25   today. So they do -- they are approved because they're 2739

1    efficacious and safe to use as directed, but they are no

2   panaceas either.

3            Wearing the patch will not make you stop

4   smoking, but it does increase your odds of quitting.

5   And, essentially, these drugs are to help you deal with

6   withdrawal that happens when you abstain, which is

7   usually most intense in the first month after somebody

8   quits and --

9       Q.   Were these numbers different during the time

10   that Jackie Loyd was smoking?

11        A.   Sure. There were many more smokers in the

12   population, a lot more smokers. And hardly anybody was

13   trying to quit in the 1950s. Half of all doctors were

14   cigarette smokers in the 1950s.

15            And as the health information came out,

16   particularly beginning in 1964 with the

17   Surgeon General's report, and then some public service

18   advertising that went on television in the late 1960s,

19   many people started to try to quit smoking. We saw

20   consumption drop right after the Surgeon General's

21    report came out in 1964, for two months, and then it

22   went back up, because a lot of people tried to quit and

23   they relapsed back to smoking.

24            But over time, the information has gotten more

25   and more. And, of course, those age cohorts that 2740

1    started to smoke earlier on got older. And as you get

2   older, you know, you get sicker. And then that

3   becomes -- all of a sudden those beliefs about smoking,

4   yeah, might be bad, I've heard something about that,

5   become a personalized deal that you can't deny. And

6   then a lot of people quit, and they quit too late.

7       Q.   Has your research been able to determine --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=134
8   have you from your research been able to determine as to

9   whether or not the cigarette companies, RJR, Reynolds,

10   Lorillard, knew what this chart depicts; that is, most

11    smokers would quit if they could?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   And how long, based on your review of this and

14   your research, review of the records, has cigarette

15   companies like Reynolds and Lorillard had that

16   knowledge?

17       A.   They've had that knowledge probably for, you

18   know, 50 years.

19       Q.   And based on your research, what did the

20   cigarette defendants, R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard,

21    choose to do with that knowledge that most people would

22   like to quit if they could?

23       A.   Well, they discussed they could -- they had a

24   couple of options. You know, they could go out of the

25   business if they made their products so people could 2741

1    easily stop using it, or they could give people excuses

2   to keep smoking and make it harder for people to quit,

3   or they could come up with alternate products to give

4   people that wouldn't, you know, be so dangerous to

5   health.

6            And, essentially, what they've done over the

7   last 50 years or so is No. 2, which is try to give

8   people an excuse to keep smoking. They offered the

9   introduction of filters and then low-tar cigarettes,

10   captured a much larger share of the market.

11             As a result, they told people that their

12   products were not injurious to health and it was all

13   just a controversy and it wasn't proven whether their

14   products were harmful to health. That's what they told

15   the consumers in the '50s, in the '60s, in the '70s, in

16   the '80s, and the '90s. It wasn't really until recently

17   that they have acknowledged their products do cause harm

18   and are addictive.

19       Q.   And in part of that choice that they make, did

20   they continue to manipulate the cigarettes to sustain

21    the addiction that they got people in?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   Now, did they -- do you agree that in order to

24   quit, you basically need three things; information,

25   motivation, and effort? 2742

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   All right. Briefly tell the jury--explain

3   those three things --

4       A.   Well-

5       Q.    how they apply to this case and smokers in

6   general.

7       A.   Sure. I mean, we all make decisions and we

8   make decisions based on information we have, so you need

9   the facts. And so there was a lot of information on

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=135
10   smoking and health coming out. And it was a lot of it

11   because of what the companies chose to do was

12   misinformation.

13            And so -- but that's what the information

14   environment was during the '60s, 70s, and '80s for many

15   smokers, so -- but -- and that affected, in my opinion,

16   people's decisions about trying to stop smoking.

17            Of course, more information was also coming out

18   about the health risks. And thanks to the efforts of

19   our Public Health Service and public health

20   professionals and doctors and so on, as the evidence

21   just grew and grew and grew over time, I mean, the

22   information balance, I think I described it in the early

23   '50s, the elephant on the scale with the marketing of

24   the cigarettes versus the grain of sand began to change.

25            MR. WALKER: Objection to the narrative. 2743

1            THE COURT: Sustained.

2   BY MR. UITERWYK:

3       Q.   All right. And, Doctor, did there -- we're

4   going to be over this.

5            As a result of this misinformation that you

6   referred to, is what they did, did that affect their

7   motive, their choice -- strike that.

8            Did that affect their ability to quit even if

9   they had motivation and effort?

10       A.   Right. As I pointed out, motivation and effort

11    to quit doesn't translate necessarily into the ability

12   to sustain staying off cigarettes. So more and more,

13   over time, people try to quit. And the predictors of

14   those are what people know and believe about the health

15   risks, whether they personalize those beliefs about the

16   health risks of smoking affecting them. But that

17   doesn't predict whether they're able to sustain staying

18   off. That's related to how dependent they are and their

19   access to the products that then sustain addiction.

20       Q.   All right. Doctor, did you assist in the

21   preparation of a quit attempt slide 48?

22       A.   Yes.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Can we have it up, please.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   And can you explain to the jury what we're 2744

1    seeing as of what -- for instance, let me start.

2            Did you look back over the records and

3   determine the methods, various things that Jackie did --

4   Jackie Loyd did in her attempts to quit smoking?

5       A.   I did.

6       Q.   And tell us about the slide and what it talks

7   about and how that confirms her addiction.

8       A.   Well, I, you know, again, went through the

9   testimony from family members who were asked about

10   things that Ms. Loyd had done to try to refrain from

11    smoking. Her husband, Mr. Loyd, talked about the fact

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=136
12   she made multiple quit attempts. And then various

13   family members mentioned things like, you know, using

14   substitutes for a cigarette, like candy and chewing gum,

15   lollipops. Switching to low-tar cigarettes, I think,

16   was mentioned as one of the methods that Ms. Loyd used

17   as an effort to try to quit.

18            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Hearsay, Your Honor.

19       Move to strike.

20            THE COURT: I'm sorry, sir. I didn't hear you.

21             MR. PEDROSA: I said, "Objection. Hearsay.

22       Move to strike."

23            THE COURT: Overruled.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   Go ahead, Doctor. 2745

1        A.   Cutting back on the number of cigarettes smoked

2   per day, that's reflected in the medical records as well

3   as testimony from family members. Use of hypnosis. The

4   nicotine patch I've talked about in '93 that she used.

5   Her husband talked about her use of a filter system.

6   And there are these filter systems you can buy

7   over the counter where you put a little device on the

8   cigarette and it tries to remove the amount of tar and

9   nicotine so you sort of ratchet down the levels that you

10   have. And then she talked with her daughters about

11    quitting, so seeking out a support. And then she

12   finally quit in December of '93.

13       Q.   All right. Now, did the medical records

14   reflect that when she started to try to quit in 1991,

15   that she had some difficulty in that regard?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   And defendants, in their opening presentation,

18   said -- they were telling the jury that only the -- she

19   only first started to first try to quit September of

20    1993 and then was able to quit by December of 1993.

21             Is that accurate, based on your review of the

22   records or a full depiction of what the evidence shows?

23            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

24            THE COURT: Sustained.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 2746

1        Q.   Doctor, what information do you have as to when

2   she first started to try to quit after she was diagnosed

3   withCOPD?

4       A.   The evidence, she started right away to quit in

5    1991 and --

6            MR. UITERWYK: Can we switch over to the ELMO,

7       please.

8            Hold on a minute, Judge.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   I'm going to show you a record. What's the

11    date of that record?

12       A.   It's June 30th, 1991.

13       Q.   All right. And that's marked for

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=137
14   identification as AU00940. And part of the medical

15   records.

16            And what does that reflect as far as her

17   quitting?

18       A.   Says, "She quit smoking recently."

19       Q.   And then I'm going to show you another document

20   which is AU0094P. And the first page, I'm not going

21    to show it, because this is in -- about a month later,

22   within a month. Actually, short period of time. Dated

23   actually a couple of days later.

24            What does it reflect with regard to her habits

25   at that time? 2747

1        A.   This is just a few days later. It's July 1st.

2   And it indicates no.

3       Q.   No tobacco?

4       A.   No smoking.

5       Q.   No?

6       A.   No.

7       Q.   All right. Now, do the records reflect that

8   she apparently had a relapse about a month later?

9       A.   Yes.

10            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

11             THE COURT: Overruled.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   I'm going to show you a document which is

14   AU0094Q dated from 8/5/91.

15            What does that reflect?

16       A.   It says, "She must stop smoking."

17       Q.   All right. Now -- so she apparently had a

18   relapse?

19       A.   That's my interpretation.

20       Q.   The fact that she had all these different

21    things that she tried, the fact that she tried and had

22   relapses, what, as an expert in addiction, does that

23   indicate to you, in your opinion, Doctor?

24       A.   Well, it's common in somebody who would be, you

25   know, heavily addicted to have relapses. And so it was 2748

1    consistent with the other things that I reviewed that

2   led me to believe that she was addicted to cigarettes.

3       Q.   Was there also even some evidence that she quit

4   for a period of time, at least, when she -- when one of

5   her daughters -- when she was pregnant with one of her

6   daughters?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   And that, unfortunately, after that she

9   relapsed?

10            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

11             THE COURT: Sustained.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   And did--what did you learn from the records

14   as far as whether or not she relapsed following that

15   attempt?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=138
16       A.   Yeah. She tried to -- well, she refrained from

17   smoking. I think there was morning sickness that --

18   with her daughter Amber when she was pregnant, and she

19   wasn't smoking. As soon as she had Amber, she went back

20   to smoking again.

21        Q.   And, ultimately, she did quit in December of

22    1993, correct?

23       A.   That's right.

24       Q.   And what ultimately led her to finally

25   quitting, in your opinion? 2749

1            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Calls for

2       speculation or hearsay.

3            THE COURT: Sustained.

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   What had happened to her during that timeframe,

6   which is -- you frequently see as an addiction

7   specialist that leads people to quitting?

8       A.   I mean, she was trying to quit and eventually

9   quit in '93 because of, you know, she couldn't breathe.

10       Q.   Have you ever heard of the term "rock bottom"?

11        A.   Yeah.

12       Q.   What does that term mean --

13       A.   Well-

14       Q.   --in your industry?

15       A.   Yeah. In the addiction field, it's -- in

16   tobacco field, it's usually when somebody is diagnosed

17   with a, you know, serious illness that's related to

18   their use of the drug. And so, you know, COPD

19   diagnosis, lung cancer.

20       Q.   She didn't have lung cancer diagnosis yet, did

21    she?

22       A.   No, she didn't.

23       Q.   All right.

24       A.   But I'm just saying, in my experience of

25   working with smokers, that's often -- it's the teachable 2750

1   moment, we call it. But it is also that rock bottom

2   moment when you've got to -- you know, there is no more

3   denying the personalized, that the belief is there, that

4   you've got to quit.

5            And I believe that she started that process in

6   '91 when she had serious breathing problems leading up

7   to the -- the other hospitalization in '93.

8       Q.   All right. I want to go back to the slide that

9   Baron put up there before, which is the addiction cycle

10   slide. I'm going to go over this very briefly, if we

11    could, Dr. Cummings.

12            MR. UITERWYK: This is in a different -

13   slide 35? Is that 35?

14            MR. PHILIPSON: You want the other one?

15            MR. UITERWYK: Yes. Sorry. I got it wrong

16       twice.

17            Yes, that's the one.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   Is this a different way of showing the

20   addiction cycle?

21        A.   Yeah. I mean, it's looking at the factors on

22   the --in the external environment that impinge on

23   people making efforts to try to overcome their physical

24   addiction to a drug. In this case, nicotine. So things

25   like the acceptability of smoking, the marketing for the 2751

1   products, and the information environment such as the

2   controversy I talked about from the tobacco company's

3   public relations, and then how that affects awareness

4   and potential harms, and then, you know, some of the

5   government regulations about where you can smoke on

6   airplanes, on public transportation, restaurants, those

7   things certainly affect smoking behavior.

8       Q.   Those external factors, would they be true

9   today?

10       A.   Sure.

11        Q.   But would they be true the way they were 50

12   years ago when Jackie smoked -- started smoking and

13   continued smoking?

14       A.   Well, the external --

15            THE COURT: You mean Ms. Loyd?

16            MR. UITERWYK: What did I say? I said

17        "Jackie Loyd."

18            THE COURT: I didn't hear that part.

19            MR. UITERWYK: I probably didn't, Judge.

20            THE WITNESS: The external factors have changed

21        over time. Obviously, the social acceptance of

22       smoking is dramatically different today than it was.

23       It was highly accepted. A right of passage for many

24       young people to take up smoking. It was on

25       television. There were celebrities, you know, 2752

1        smoking. So that has changed dramatically.

2            The marketing of cigarettes has also changed.

3       It was on radio, television -- back in the '50s and

4       '60s, over 80 different shows, popular shows of the

5       day, you know, only three channels back then, were

6       sponsored by cigarette companies.

7            There was a massive amount of advertising that

8       went on during the time that Ms. Loyd was alive,

9       probably - well, between 1940 and 19 - 2005,1

10       think the companies spent $50 billion dollars in

11        marketing. That has changed today because of some

12       of the regulations on marketing the product.

13            The cigarette controversy that existed and

14       was -- involved hundreds of millions of dollars in

15       public relations efforts that went on to counter the

16       health message has changed in the 50 years.

17            MR. WALKER: Objection. Narrative.

18            THE COURT: Sustained.

19            MR. UITERWYK: I'm asking him to go through

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=140
20       this, Your Honor.

21             THE COURT: Well, he needs to do it point by

22       point.

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   All right. The potential harms that were known

25   at that time compared to today, how --2753

1        A.   The potential harms, obviously, the awareness

2   of those harms, are much different today than they were

3   back in the 1950s, and that has changed over time.

4       Q.   And government regulations?

5       A.   There were none. There are many regulations

6   today on, you know, cigarette sales that certainly

7   affect the behavior of smokers such as where you can

8   light up. That certainly has had a big effect. We

9   know -- you know, taxes on cigarettes, those kinds of

10   things, have affected access.

11        Q.   Sorry to interrupt you, Dr. Cummings, but

12   the -- this addictive -- so the external factors are

13   different today than they were --

14       A.   That's correct.

15       Q.    when she smoked primarily, correct?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   Now, the internal factors, are they basically

18   the same?

19       A.   The internal factors are the same.

20       Q.   Has there been any change made by the cigarette

21    companies to reduce the effect of the internal factors?

22       A.   No. Actually, the changes that have been made

23   are to the product. And that actually --

24            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 2754

1        Q.   That's what I'm referring to.

2            MR. WALKER: Objection. Scientific design

3       opinion.

4            THE COURT: Overruled.

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   Go ahead.

7       A.   Yeah, the changes to the product have made it

8   easier for people to inhale the product. The filter

9   made the particle sizes smaller facilitating deeper

10   inhalation, which contributed to a greater risk of

11    diseases like COPD, lung diseases.

12       Q.   All right. Let me go, if we could, to PT-2077.

13            MR. UITERWYK: Tab 47, Your Honor.

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   What is the document that we're about to show

16   to the jury? First of all, who is this from, who is it

17   to and, in general, what is it about?

18       A.   This is from Mr. Steele to Mr. McCue at Brown &

19   Williamson. Both were in the marketing department at

20   Brown & Williamson. Mr. Steele was one of the brand

21    managers for Brown & Williamson. And they're discussing

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=141
22   some of their market data relationship to consumer

23   understanding of nicotine.

24       Q.   All right. And then you said Brown &

25   Williamson. Who owns Brown & Williamson? 2755

1        A.   They're now owned by R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

2   Company.

3            MR. UITERWYK: All right. And, Your Honor, I'm

4       going to offer into evidence PT-2077.

5            MR. WALKER: No new objections to this.

6            THE COURT: All right. It will be received in

7       evidence.

8            (Plaintiffs Exhibit No. PT-2077 admitted in

9   evidence.)

10            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Could we have that,

11       please.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   The one part that we're going to be looking at,

14   that's from -- dated August 1978?

15       A.   That is correct.

16       Q.   "The Future Consumer Reaction to Nicotine."

17            Had this -- this is a Brown & Williamson

18   document, a company owned by Reynolds.

19            At that time in '78, did the cigarette company

20   conclude, "Very few consumers are aware of the effects

21    of nicotine, i.e. its addictive nature and that nicotine

22   is a poison?"

23            Did I read that right?

24       A.   You did.

25       Q.   All right. And did the cigarette companies do 2756

1    anything -- up until 1990 whatever -- do anything to

2   help the consumers become aware of the effects of

3   nicotine?

4       A.   No.

5       Q.   Did the cigarette companies, at any time

6   between 1950s, 1940s, up until the 1990s, do anything to

7   help the consumers know about the addictive nature of

8   their cigarettes?

9            MR. WALKER: Objection. Asked and answered.

10            THE COURT: Sustained.

11             MR. UITERWYK: I actually said "aware of the

12       effects of nicotine," Judge. This time it was

13        "addictive nature." A different question.

14            THE COURT: Okay. I didn't catch the

15       difference. Put it to him again, please.

16   BY MR. UITERWYK:

17       Q.   All right. Did the cigarette companies at any

18   time during that timeframe, that 50-year timeframe that

19   we're talking about, do anything to inform potential

20   smokers, addicted smokers, or anyone about the addictive

21    nature of cigarettes?

22       A.   During that timeframe, they said that their

23   products were not addictive. So that's the information

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=142
24   they gave consumers.

25            THE COURT: All right. Would you approach, 2757

1       please.

2            (At the bench.)

3            THE COURT: I need to see Mr. Mayfield and

4       Mr. Bigger.

5            MR. UITERWYK: So you don't need to see me?

6            THE COURT: Well, yeah, I need to see all of

7       you.

8            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

9            THE COURT: All of -

10            MR. UITERWYK: As well as Mr. --

11             THE COURT: Yeah.

12            MR. BIGGER: Your Honor, may Mr. Trentalange

13       come too, or would you like him to come instead of

14       me? He understands --

15            THE COURT: Whoever knows the most about what

16       I'm going to inquire about.

17            First of all, is this a convenient break point?

18            MR. UITERWYK: It's convenient to me. I'm

19       actually going to another thing.

20            THE COURT: Okay. Well, I tried to break it

21        up.

22            Have you reached a consensus with those

23       questions to ask?

24            MR. BIGGER: I think so.

25            MR. MAYFIELD: I think we've got a consensus on 2758

1        at least three. There may be some disagreement as

2       to whether a fourth or a fifth, and you may have

3       your own, but these three, we agree, should be read.

4            MR. BIGGER: That's the same one.

5            MR. MAYFIELD: That? Yeah. I just tried to

6       clean it up because you had so much scratch.

7            THE COURT: Okay. All right. I think it's -

8       we're fine and I'll ask her to remain --1 only want

9       to do this once, so I'll ask if either of you have

10       any additional questions. If you do, then you can

11        approach.

12            MR. WALKER: Okay.

13            THE COURT: Okay. And I'll let the jury go for

14       lunch for now.

15            MR. BIGGER: Thank you, Judge.

16            THE COURT: Is that okay, Hank?

17            MR. UITERWYK: I'm not going to respond to

18       that, Judge.

19            MR. BIGGER: I'll try and enforce it.

20            THE COURT: I can't have a two-by-four by the

21       podium.

22            MR. UITERWYK: You and I are the same age. You

23       can't teach an old dog new tricks. Unfortunately,

24       I'm in the old dog school. And, Judge, I will try

25       my best. I apologize.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=143
2759

1            MR. WALKER: Judge, I could bring a two-by-four

2       if you'll authorize me to use it.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah. But, you know what? I'm

4       not sure it's going to help an old dog even if you

5       do that.

6            THE COURT: All right.

7            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, may I just make one

8       request?

9            THE COURT: Yes.

10            MR. WALKER: Instead of asking whether we have

11        questions within the earshot of the jury, maybe just

12       have us come up?

13            THE COURT: Yeah. Okay. That's fine. Yes,

14       that's a good idea. Okay. Thanks.

15            (In open court.)

16            THE COURT: All right. Members of the jury,

17       we're going to recess for lunch. Try and engage --

18       there aren't as many people in the courthouse on

19       Thursday as there is on Monday. And I don't know

20       how many of you eat -- can most of you get lunch and

21       be back by -- can all of you -- not most of you.

22       Can all of you get lunch and be back by 1:00? Is

23       that enough time for you to --

24            Okay. All right. We'll be in recess until

25        1:00 p.m. Be mindful of my instructions to keep an 2760

1        open mind and not to discuss or communicate about

2       this case in any manner, way, shape, or form.

3            Ms. Burrell, I need to ask you a couple more

4       questions, so if you would remain seated. The rest

5       of you are excused until 1:00.

6            (The jury excused from the courtroom. Juror

7   Burrell remained.)

8            THE COURT: Thank you, Dr. Cummings. Would you

9       wait outside, please.

10            THE WITNESS: Sure.

11             MR. BIGGER: Can he go to lunch?

12            THE COURT: Yeah.

13            (Witness exited courtroom.)

14            THE COURT: Thank you. You may be seated.

15            Ms. Burrell, most of these questions would have

16       been asked of you when we had jury selection, and it

17       only came to light, obviously, since after you were

18       chosen. So you shouldn't take any offense at us

19       asking this, because it would be the same questions

20       we would ask had we known of your knowledge of

21        Dr. Halsey beforehand.

22            So let me just ask you a couple of questions.

23       What years did you work for Dr. Halsey?

24            JUROR BURRELL: 2007 to 2010.

25            THE COURT: 2007 to 2010? 2761

1           JUROR BURRELL: Yeah.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=144
2            THE COURT: Okay. And did you know Dr. Halsey

3       in a professional manner, in a social manner, or

4       both?

5            JUROR BURRELL: Well, I didn't know that he

6       works at the health firm, because he has a separate

7       practice right now.

8            THE COURT: Okay.

9            JUROR BURRELL: It's only when I saw his

10       signature up there.

11             THE COURT: Right. But where did -- you worked

12       for him?

13            JUROR BURRELL: Yes.

14            THE COURT: And where did you work for him?

15            JUROR BURRELL: At Partners in Allergy &

16       Asthmas. Valrico.

17            THE COURT: And did you know him just in that

18       capacity as an employee?

19            JUROR BURRELL: Yes.

20            THE COURT: Did you socialize with him in any

21        way?

22            JUROR BURRELL: No.

23            THE COURT: Okay. And is there anything about

24       your relationship with Dr. Halsey that would cause

25       you to give any more weight or less weight to any 2762

1        evidence relating to Dr. Halsey than any other

2       witness?

3            JUROR BURRELL: No.

4            THE COURT: Okay. Regardless of your knowledge

5       of him, you could treat him the same as any other

6       witness?

7            JUROR BURRELL: Yeah.

8            THE COURT: Okay. Can I see counsel, please.

9            (At the bench.)

10            THE COURT: Anything further, Mr. Trentalange?

11             MR. TRENTALANGE: Not from the plaintiff,

12       Your Honor.

13            THE COURT: Anything, Mr. Mayfield?

14            MR. MAYFIELD: No. I think given those

15       answers, that's good enough.

16            THE COURT: Anything further, Mr. Brock?

17            MR. BROCK: Yes, Your Honor.

18            THE COURT: Okay.

19            MR. BROCK: To set the predicate, also remember

20       his records say asthma/COPD or COPD/asthma.

21        Dr. Mannino got up here and talked about the

22       overlap.

23            I think it would be important to know what did

24       she do for Dr. Halsey. Did she perform PFTs and how

25       many did they perform during the time she worked for 2763

1        him.

2            MR. TRENTALANGE: You know, Judge, I'm

3       struggling to remember jury selection. I'm pretty

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=145
4       sure that Mr. Walker asked of them generally who

5       knows anything about PFTs. And I don't --1 can't

6       recall specifically, but I know somebody actually

7       indicated -- and it might have been this juror --

8       that she had familiarity with PFTs. And that was

9       already gone into.

10            I also asked a general question, "Tell me the

11       kinds of work that you've done as an adult," as part

12       of the tell me about yourself, as one of the things.

13       And I don't recall --1 haven't had a chance to look

14       at the transcript, but I'm pretty sure she went into

15       the kinds of work that she did during general jury

16       selection.

17            So we have gone over this. I understand that

18       the bottom-line question is the last question that

19       he just asked.

20            THE COURT: I think --1 think the -- I'm going

21        to decline to hear that question.

22            MR. BROCK: I don't think there is --

23       Your Honor--

24            THE COURT: No, I know.

25            MR. BROCK: I don't think there is any harm to 2764

1        ask her what she did for him. What's the --1 think

2       it could elicit something that's very material to

3       the fact --

4            THE COURT: Shouldn't that have been asked in

5       general voir dire?

6            MR. BROCK: Well, she did. In fact, when --1

7       recall in voir dire, when asked if they had done

8       PFTs, she was one of the people that raised her

9       hand, and she talked about she did the breathing --

10       the breathing. And so she did explain that she had

11        done it.

12            What we did not know at that time, that she --

13            THE COURT: If she says, yes, she did them,

14       then where do we go?

15            MR. BROCK: Okay. Then I would say that the

16       fact that she -- my next question would be if she,

17       in fact, did perform PFTs with Dr. Halsey who gave

18       an opinion in his records that reflect asthma/COPD,

19       COPD/asthma --

20            THE COURT: Isn't Dr. Halsey a treating doctor?

21             MR. BROCK: Yes, sir. Which --

22            THE COURT: Okay. So she may have knowledge --

23       there is at least a possibility that she may have

24       knowledge of Ms. Loyd?

25            MR. TRENTALANGE: No, Your Honor. She worked 2765

1        there in 2007 to 2010. Ms. Loyd was already dead.

2            THE COURT: You're right.

3            MR. MAYFIELD: I mean, Your Honor, we're fairly

4       close to tying up all the loose ends, but it seems

5       silly to get this close and not ask --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=146
6            MR. TRENTALANGE: Judge, if I could just --1

7       said no further questions from me, but my concern is

8       we're going to be calling undue attention or giving

9       undue attention to her time period now or to this

10       doctor once we start questioning her about

11        whether -- it's like a curative instruction. You

12       know, you give a curative instruction that says

13       please don't think about the elephant, people think

14       about the elephant.

15            Now, we're going to be calling unnecessary

16       attention to these records, which are just part of

17       the entire evidence in the case. And, you know, I

18       understand their right to know the ultimate

19       question, but this area was covered in voir dire.

20       We don't get to go back and do a voir dire as the

21        case develops.

22            THE COURT: My instinct tells me not to ask any

23       further questions. And based upon the general fact

24       that she's not going to treat Dr. Halsey's testimony

25       any different than any other witness, so --2766

1            MR. WALKER: Judge, may I just correct

2       something for the record. I did not ask her if she

3       had any particular familiarity with this particular

4       doctor's practices. That didn't come up in

5       voir dire. And it wouldn't have come up because I

6       didn't know about the connection.

7            THE COURT: Okay. Fine. Well, I'm going to

8       excuse her for lunch. Thank you.

9            MR. MAYFIELD: Yes, sir. Is there anything we

10       can do to ensure she isn't going to, in jury

11        deliberations, at some point, talk to the other

12       jurors about her relationship with Dr. Halsey? I

13       don't know the answer to that question, but that's a

14       concern that I don't know that we can properly

15       address.

16            THE COURT: Do you want me to give her

17       instruction that she's not to communicate to the

18       other jurors that she worked for Dr. Halsey? I

19       really think you're spending way too much effort on

20       this, but is that what you want me to do?

21             MR. MAYFIELD: If there -- if there wasn't a

22       record with his name on it that actually answered a

23       verdict form question, we'd be less concerned about

24       it.

25            MR. TRENTALANGE: Here's the problem, Judge, 2767

1        you know. You go for a fourth down and you don't

2       make it, you don't get to go back and say, you know

3       what, I changed my mind, I want to punt. As this

4       case develops, I mean, it -- and I'm being very

5       careful, because I want to let them have due

6       process. I don't want the whole trial to be

7       tainted. But there is an element of, you know, due

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=147
8       diligence.

9            Remember where this record came from, why she

10       knows about it. It's because -- because a very

11        well-done, I think, and very well-prepared

12       cross-examination of the pulmonologist in this case

13       where one of the records the defense counsel put up

14       on the screen was this record of this treating

15       doctor.

16            And what I did in my voir dire, I asked about

17       Moffitt Cancer Center, people that worked at Moffitt

18       Cancer Center, and whether there's going to be any

19       concern, not just about witnesses, but about

20       documents that they're going to see and what they're

21        going to give undue weight to that. And that's the

22       question that was asked.

23            And now to tell this witness that she has to

24       carve out a portion of her life experience and not

25       rely on it and not discuss it with other members of 2768

1        the jury, I just don't think that's fair to do.

2            MR. BROCK: Your Honor, that begs why it's

3       important to do the further inquiry to find out, in

4       fact, whether she was doing that test and bring that

5       back.

6            MR. MAYFIELD: Ms. Burrell.

7            THE COURT: Can you just part the waters?

8            (In open court.)

9            THE COURT: Ms. Burrell, did you - in your

10       employment with Dr. Halsey, did you perform

11       pulmonary function tests?

12            JUROR BURRELL: I did have knowledge. I

13       perform pulmonary function tests.

14            THE COURT: Okay. And did you do them for

15       Dr. Halsey?

16            JUROR BURRELL: Yes.

17            THE COURT: Okay.

18            JUROR BURRELL: And I have knowledge of

19       diagnosis.

20            THE COURT: Did you discuss those when we had

21       jury selection? Were questions asked about that?

22            JUROR BURRELL: Dr. Walker did ask me question

23       about it. I'm -- not Dr. I'm sorry.

24            THE COURT: Mr. Walker.

25            JUROR BURRELL: Mr. Walker did ask me. 2769

1            THE COURT: Okay.

2            MR. UITERWYK: Congratulations.

3            JUROR BURRELL: And I demonstrate for him, yes.

4            THE COURT: Yeah. Okay.

5            JUROR BURRELL: So I do have a little bit of

6       knowledge, so if that's --

7            THE COURT: Okay. Thank you, ma'am. You may

8       go to lunch.

9            JUROR BURRELL: Okay.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=148
10            THE COURT: Please don't discuss our

11        conversation with the other jurors.

12            JUROR BURRELL: I won't. I won't.

13            (Juror Burrell excused from the courtroom.)

14            MR. UITERWYK: Congratulations, John.

15            THE COURT: Anything further?

16            MR. MAYFIELD: Your Honor, I do think we will,

17       and we'll make --

18            MR. UITERWYK: Craig, we can't hear you.

19            MR. PEDROSA: We don't need to be at sidebar

20       anymore.

21             MR. MAYFIELD:  Sorry. Right. Forgive me.

22            THE COURT: No, that's all right. You can step

23       back, please.

24            MR. MAYFIELD: Now, I'm going to speak full

25       volume, I'll back away from you. 2770

1            THE COURT: Yeah, that's fine.

2            MR. MAYFIELD: Your Honor, based on what we've

3       heard and the fact we have two alternates that don't

4       have this type of experience, the defendants are

5       making a motion to excuse this juror. Whether it's

6       now or at the end of the trial and we just seat the

7       first alternate instead of her, it will be up to the

8       Court.

9            But given that she has experience with this

10       doctor, his practices and procedures, and that

11        medical records have been published that will go

12       back into evidence that have this doctor's

13       conclusion on what will be a verdict form question

14       whether Mrs. Loyd had COPD, you know, trial courts

15       do not get reversed for seating appropriately vetted

16       alternates, but they do get reversed for allowing

17       jurors that are close calls to stay on a panel.

18            THE COURT: Well, I can tell you this, I'm

19       certainly not going to do it now.

20            MR. MAYFIELD: Understood.

21             THE COURT: I'm certainly not going to do it

22       now. Because, you know, I asked the defendants

23       whether or not they would stipulate to more than

24       two, and you wouldn't. And so with that, we only

25       have two. 2771

1            And if -- if I were to do it -- I'm not saying

2       I am or I am not --1 wouldn't do it now and run the

3       risk of a mistrial if we lost -- well, I guess we'd

4       have to lose two more. So I'm not going to do that.

5            And I -- and it's my understanding, and I want

6       to confirm on the record -- all of you may be seated

7       if you wish.

8            It's my understanding, and I want to confirm

9       that the list of -- Mr. Trentalange made a

10       representation to the Court yesterday that the list

11        of witnesses that, I believe, Mr. Trentalange read

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=149
12       to the panel was a list that was prepared either by

13       joint counsel or by defense counsel; is that

14       accurate?

15            MR. MAYFIELD: It was a joint combination of

16       witnesses anticipated to be called at trial. It was

17       not any way endeavored to be --

18            THE COURT: Well -

19            MR. MAYFIELD: -- a list of the 250 doctors and

20       treatment facilities involved.

21             THE COURT: Well, I understand that. But, you

22       know, we're in a situation where Ms. Burrell has

23       stated she did do the tests, but she can --1 mean,

24       I don't know that it's much different than -- and

25       maybe I'm -- maybe the analogy is not a fair one, 2772

1       but in criminal cases or in other civil cases, you

2       may have a cop testify or law enforcement officer

3       testify, and one of the jurors may be married to a

4       law enforcement or their son is a law enforcement.

5            And typical question is, "Are you going to

6       treat this witness any differently because your --

7       your son or husband is a law enforcement officer?

8       Are you going to believe him or disbelieve him, you

9       know, any more?"

10            Some people say, "Yes, my son's a cop, and if a

11        cop gets up there, I'm going to believe anything he

12       says even if he tells me today's Friday." And

13       others say no.

14            And so I'm -- you can renew your motion at the

15       conclusion of the case, but I am not going to excuse

16       her now.

17            MR. TRENTALANGE: Your Honor, may I be heard

18       briefly?

19            THE COURT: Yes.

20            MR. TRENTALANGE: It's important for the Court

21        to recognize and to recall that the juror did

22       discuss her doing pulmonary function tests.

23            THE COURT: Right.

24            MR. TRENTALANGE: And we spent four days on

25       jury selection, and the defendants left either four 2773

1        or five peremptory challenges unused. This juror

2       indicated at one point during jury selection that

3       she favored the plaintiff a little bit.

4            So to leave four peremptory challenges, to have

5       the resources that the defendants have in this case

6       available for jury selection, to have the name being

7       raised in exhibit that they used during

8       cross-examination, were obviously prepared to do and

9       familiar with, to me, it smacks of trying to create

10       a problem where there is none. Or certainly if

11        there was a potential problem, it could have been

12       headed off during jury selection.

13            But to leave four peremptory challenges on the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=150
14       table and then object to a juror, it just, to me,

15       does not seem to be something that you do in good

16       faith, especially when the juror discussed these

17       very issues, the pulmonary function test, which, no

18       matter who the doctor is, there are pulmonary

19       function tests involved in this case. They're key

20       to the evidence in the case. Nobody could deny that

21        they knew about the fact that pulmonary function

22       tests were going to come up.

23            So there was no further inquiry on that. The

24       peremptories that were left unused. And I think

25       what we have here is, you know, fishing for either 2774

1        creating error or creating a way to get to some more

2       favorable jurors.

3            MR. WALKER: If I might, Judge.

4            THE COURT: Well, was -- the document that

5       revealed Dr. Halsey's name, was that a document that

6       the defendants put up? Was it in evidence?

7            MR. TRENTALANGE: It's in evidence.

8            THE COURT: It's in-

9            MR. BIGGER: It's in evidence.

10            THE COURT: Okay.

11             MR. TRENT ALANGE: But on cross-examination,

12       obviously, that cross-examination was not random.

13       That was well planned and well done.

14            THE COURT: Okay.

15            MR. TRENT ALANGE: And the document went up on

16       the screen with --

17            THE COURT: All right.

18            MR. TRENT ALANGE: - that doctor's name on it.

19            THE COURT: All right. I'm not going to hear

20       any further argument on it, and I'm denying the

21        request. If you want to renew your request at the

22       end of the case, I'll -- I'll hear it again, but

23       it's denied now.

24            MR. WALKER: Judge, may I - I didn't rise to

25       argue. I just want the record to be corrected with 2775

1        respect to a few things Mr. Trentalange had an

2       opportunity to say that I didn't have a chance to

3       address.

4            THE COURT: Okay.

5            MR. WALKER: The document was introduced by

6       plaintiffs. I did not ask this juror about whether

7       she had any familiarity with that particular

8       doctor's procedures. The problem isn't just that

9       she's done PFTs, but that she has personal knowledge

10       about how PFTs were conducted by that doctor in that

11        doctor's lab.

12            To follow Your Honor's analogy, it's not just

13       somebody who's married to the policeman. It's

14       somebody who worked in the lab where, you know, an

15       autopsy was done, for example, on a criminal case,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=151
16       and there is a question about whether the autopsy

17       was done properly.

18            THE COURT: Okay. Well, your request is

19       denied.

20            Now, Mr. Uiterwyk.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Yes, sir.

22            THE COURT: Thank you. You need to do a better

23       job of addressing the witnesses and not looking at

24       the jury. It's not --1 just frown on it. Okay?

25            MR. UITERWYK: Yes, sir. 2776

1            THE COURT: And refer to all people as Mr. or

2       Mrs. or Jack --or their full name.

3            And you need to have a conversation with your

4       expert. And that is, it needs to be Q and A. And

5       you need to ask a little bit more precise questions

6       and have him respond, and it's not an opportunity

7       for him just to say everything that he wants to say

8       about a particular subject. This is -- it's his

9       opportunity to answer the question that was directed

10       to him.

11             MR. UITERWYK: Yes, sir.

12            THE COURT: Big difference between asking a

13       witness what time it is and the witness telling you

14       the time versus how to build a watch.

15            MR. UITERWYK: Yes, sir.

16            THE COURT: What is your current -- please be

17       seated.

18            What is your current schedule like for

19       remainder of the week? You going to have --1

20       assume that Dr. Cummings will probably be here

21        through tomorrow.

22            MR. UITERWYK: I anticipate that, Judge.

23            THE COURT: Okay. And then how many more

24       witnesses do you have? Do you intend to call both

25       Edward Robinson and Christy Leung by deposition? 2777

1            MR. UITERWYK: I honestly don't know at this

2       stage, Judge.

3            THE COURT: Well, here's the position you put

4       me in. You're going have to make a determination by

5       that -- on that by Friday, by tomorrow, because I do

6       read every page of this, every page of the

7       designations. And I'm not going to do -- there are

8       other things I would rather do than --

9            MR. UITERWYK: I can understand that,

10       Your Honor.

11             THE COURT: There's better reading material for

12       me than -- than this. And so I'm not going to spend

13       about six hours or more reading depositions if

14       they're not going to be used. So you need to let me

15       know by 5:00 whether or not you're going to use

16       them.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Yes, sir.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=152
18            THE COURT: Okay. Assuming that you do use

19       these, when do you think you might rest or how many

20       more witnesses do you expect to have?

21             MR. UITERWYK: Well, we're reevaluating that in

22       light of the time constraints.

23            THE COURT: Okay. Maybe you can huddle and let

24       us know on that also by tomorrow morning.

25            MR. UITERWYK: We -2778

1            MR. WALKER: Judge, I just need to add that we

2       actually need to know that too, because we need --

3       we have witnesses --

4            THE COURT: Well, I'm sure.

5            MR. WALKER: -- coming from a great distance

6       and we need to know.

7            THE COURT: Okay. Well - sure.

8            MR. UITERWYK: As do we.

9            THE COURT: Yeah. Well, okay - well, you need

10       to huddle tonight and let me know so we can have

11        sort of an overall game plan and so that, you

12       know -- starting Monday, we're starting our third

13       week here. And I told the jurors that the case

14       would be a three-week trial, but it would -- could

15       go into the fourth week. And I didn't tell them a

16       specific day.

17            So it seems to me, based upon what the parties

18       have told me previously, that it's extremely

19       unlikely, almost --

20            If you want to go to lunch, you can go to

21        lunch.

22            THE CLERK: You sure?

23            THE COURT: Yeah. That - whatever's left,

24       but -

25            I can't imagine that we're going to finish by 2779

1        the end of the third week.

2            MR. UITERWYK: No, I don't think so either,

3       Your Honor. But just so it doesn't appear that we

4       are really dragging things out, he's been on the

5       stand -- if you count just pure testimony time, it

6       hasn't been that long.

7            THE COURT: No, I understand. And I'm not-

8       but -- but look. Everybody's doing a good job, but

9       I'm -- I'm not criticizing counsel. I'm not

10       singling out any counsel. But we need --we need to

11        move forward. And, obviously, we're going to go

12       into the fourth week.

13            But I just want to make sure we're not going

14       beyond that, because we're not going beyond it. I

15       can tell you this. We are not going beyond the

16       fourth week.

17            MR. WALKER: Judge, may I raise an additional

18       concern? I think what Your Honor told the jury is

19       that we -- we would be three weeks and maybe a day

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=153
20       or two after that. My concern is, if we go past

21        what Your Honor told them, it will be during the

22       defense presentation.

23            THE COURT: Okay. I hear you on that. And I

24       told them --1 remember specifically, I can't tell

25       you a specific day, whether or not it will be 2780

1        Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. So they're here.

2       They're here.

3            And I'm not -- you know, the defense always --

4       not always, but frequently has that -- that issue,

5       and I don't --1 don't --1 think it's a nonissue.

6            MR. WALKER: They have enough witnesses to go

7       all next week. And if we start the following

8       Monday --

9            THE COURT: Okay. Well, that's why I'm asking

10       them for a game plan.

11             MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.

12            MR. UITERWYK: And, Your Honor, if we could --

13       not dispense, but reduce the number of sidebars and

14       going -- not go over the same issues over and over

15       and over again, we may very well get finished in a

16       timely manner. So I'm trying my best.

17            I've cut out some direct. I'm going to cut out

18       some witnesses to the extent that I can, but we've

19       also got to put on our case. Doing my best,

20       Your Honor.

21             THE COURT: Okay. I'm sure everybody is.

22            All right. We'll be in recess until 1:00.

1                      PROCEEDINGS

2              (Court called to order at 1:08 p.m.)

3              THE BAILIFF: All rise. Come to order.

4         Court's back in session. Check your cellphones,

5         please.

6              THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

7              Bring the jury in, please.

8              MR. UITERWYK: Judge, just for clarification,

9         so I know about these exhibits, what we're going

10         to be doing, I know -- I've got a list of what you

11         basically said that's going to be -- it's

12         admitted. And then you kind of reserved on one on

13         foundation. So what I'm going to do, when my

14         notes reflect that it's been admitted, I'm going

15         to say, This document has already been

16         pre-admitted, and then -- subject to any

17         objections and so forth --

18              THE COURT: All right.

19              MR. UITERWYK: -- or something to that effect

20         and then go on so we can move a little quicker on

21          that.

22              THE COURT: Okay. Just move to have it

23         admitted.

24              MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

25              THE BAILIFF: All rise. 2787

1               (Jury in at 1:10 p.m.)

2              THE COURT: Thank you. Be seated. We're

3         ready to continue.

4              Mr. Uiterwyk?

5              MR. UITERWYK: May it please the Court.

6              THE COURT: Yes, sir.

7              MR. UITERWYK: Counsel.

8                  CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION

9     BY MR. UITERWYK:

10         Q.   Dr. Cummings, we've now gone through with one

11      other topic, but I want to add a few little -- few more

12     things and then go move on to another subject, with

13     regard to addicted smokers.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=158
14              Based on your experience, your knowledge and

15     training, do most smokers who become addicted regret

16     having started smoking?

17         A.   They do.

18         Q.   And has your research shown that the

19     defendants in this case recognize that over the years

20     they were selling a product that most of their

21      customers would stop if they could?

22         A.   Yes, it has.

23         Q.   And are there particular documents in that

24     regard? One, for instance, is the Nordine study.

25              Are you familiar with that document? 2788

1         A.   Yeah, Richard Nordine. The document is

2     authored by Claude Teague and sent to Gerald DiMarco.

3     Dr. Teague at the time was one of the senior scientists

4     at Reynolds in part of their product development area,

5     and Dr. DiMarco was the vice president for research at

6     Reynolds at the time.

7              MR. UITERWYK: And that document has been

8         marked for identification as PT 1820, and I'm

9         going to offer and move that into evidence,

10         Your Honor, in connection with the witness's

11          testimony.

12              THE COURT: Any additional objections?

13              MR. WALKER: No new objections.

14              THE COURT: All right. It will be received

15         in evidence.

16              (Exhibit No. PT 1820 received.)

17     BY MR. UITERWYK:

18         Q.   And this is a document you were just

19     discussing; is that correct?

20         A.   Correct.

21          Q.   And I want to go on just right to the basics

22     of that document, if we could.

23              And in that document, they said, "Most of

24     those who have smoked for any significant time would

25     like to stop. Many, but not most of those who would 2789

1     like to stop smoking, are able to do so."

2              MR. UITERWYK: And then go on.

3              Second paragraph -- go to the first

4         paragraph.

5     BY MR. UITERWYK:

6         Q.   And does the document also go on then to say,

7     "We should be able to maintain/increase the size of the

8     total market by influencing entry and exit rates."

9              Who are the entry and who are the exit rates?

10              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, meaning

11          and intent.

12              THE COURT: Rephrase, please.

13              MR. UITERWYK: All right.

14     BY MR. UITERWYK:

15         Q.   Based on -- have you seen documents referring

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=159
16     to entry and exit rates and cigarette companies using

17     that term?

18         A.   Yes.

19         Q.   And what is your understanding of what the

20     term "entry and exit rates" mean?

21               MR. WALKER: Same objection.

22              THE COURT: Overruled.

23              THE WITNESS: It's basically new smokers

24         coming into the market, predominantly teenagers

25         who come in; and the exit rates are people who 2790

1         leave the market, those who quit or die.

2     BY MR. UITERWYK:

3         Q.   And based on your research and information

4     you've obtained from documents like this, were the

5     cigarette companies very sensitive about the entry and

6     exit rates?

7         A.   Yes, because it dictated their profitability.

8     They needed to have a new flow of smokers coming in to

9     replace those who were leaving the market. And they

10     understood the market is a dynamic between those

11      entering and those leaving.

12         Q.   And was it concluded in this document, "We

13     cannot ever be comfortable selling a product which most

14     of our customers would stop using if they could. This

15     is to say, if the exit gate from our market should

16     suddenly open, we would be out of business overnight."

17              Did I read that correctly?

18         A.   Well, not entirely. It says, "We could be

19     out of business overnight."

20              That's what it says.

21          Q.   Okay. Sorry.

22              And, Doctor, based on your review of this

23     document and other documents, did they take steps --

24     did people like Reynolds and Lorillard take steps in

25     order that they would not be out of business overnight? 2791

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   And briefly, what is that?

3         A.   Well, they had three things. They said, you

4     know, based on the dynamics of the market and since

5     most people would leave -- in other words, most of the

6     smokers would stop smoking if they could -- if that

7     ever were to occur, they had three options.

8              Option one was to go out of business. Option

9     two is to find a way to eliminate the desire of smokers

10     to stop. And option three was to provide other

11     products away from conventional cigarettes that would

12     meet the same needs as cigarettes now but without the

13     associated negatives.

14         Q.   And what did -- option did they choose?

15         A.   Well, they haven't gone out of business. If

16     you go to the final paragraph, they basically said

17     clearly cigarettes are going to be around for a while.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=160
18     So they say, Clearly we will remain in the conventional

19     cigarette business as long as we can. But I believe in

20     view of the Nordine study and other information, we

21      need to begin to very seriously think about where we'd

22     go when and if the market disappears.

23              And there are some long-term high risk cost

24     things that we can -- that we need to address because,

25     to repeat, we cannot be comfortable selling --2792

1      comfortable marketing a product which most of our

2     customers would do without if they could.

3              So essentially they focused on number two,

4     which is giving, you know, people reassurance that --

5              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, meaning

6         and intent.

7              THE COURT: I'm sorry, sir?

8              MR. WALKER: The meaning and intent order.

9              MR. UITERWYK: My question was what

10         alternatives.

11               THE COURT: Rephrase.

12     BY MR. UITERWYK:

13         Q.   All right. And we were discussing what

14     alternatives did they choose and why.

15         A.   They chose number two, finding ways to

16     eliminate the desire of smokers to stop smoking by

17     providing reassurance to smokers and also offering them

18     products like low tar, low nicotine cigarettes as an

19     option instead of quitting.

20              And more recently they've moved into number

21      three with a variety of new products, including oral

22     tobacco products.

23         Q.   Did the -- did their continuing

24     manipulations -- continuing design, engineering, and

25     manipulation also part of their way to eliminate the 2793

1      desire of smokers to stop?

2              MR. WALKER: Objection, argumentative.

3              THE COURT: Overruled.

4              THE WITNESS: Yes.

5     BY MR. UITERWYK:

6         Q.   All right. Now, has the attorney general

7     looked into the question as to why people continue to

8     smoke?

9         A.   The attorney general or the Surgeon General?

10         Q.   I did it twice now.

11               The Surgeon General. Go ahead.

12         A.   Yes. The Surgeon General has on many

13     occasions, but two reports in '94 and one in 2012 was

14     specifically on -- on issues of uptake of smoking; an

15     '88 report and the 2010 report, one was -- the '88

16     report was on nicotine addiction, which dealt with why

17     people continue to smoke, and the 2010 was on

18     mechanisms of smoking contributes to disease. And

19     there are sections in here that talk about addiction,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=161
20     product engineering and its link to why people get sick

21      from smoking.

22         Q.   And did also the cigarette companies like

23     Reynolds and Lorillard study issues of why people

24     continue to smoke?

25         A.   Absolutely. 2794

1          Q.   During these same time frames?

2         A.   Yes.

3              MR. UITERWYK: Let's first talk about -- look

4         at the attorney general tab -- it's slide 38.

5              MR. PHILLIPSON: Which slide number are you

6         on, sir?

7              MR. UITERWYK: Slide 54 -- not 54, slide 38.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   And what report is this quoted from?

10         A.   This is one of the conclusions in the --

11               MR. WALKER: Objection, improper bolstering.

12              THE COURT: Overruled.

13              THE WITNESS: -- 2010 Surgeon General's

14         report.

15              MR. UITERWYK: And for the record, the

16         Surgeon General report from which that is from is

17         PT 3895, which I'm going to offer into evidence as

18         well, Your Honor.

19              THE COURT: Any additional objections?

20              MR. WALKER: No additional objections.

21               THE COURT: All right. Overruled.

22              THE CLERK: Can you repeat the number for me?

23              MR. UITERWYK: 3895.

24              THE CLERK: Thank you.

25              THE COURT: It will be received in evidence. 2795

1               (Exhibit No. PT 3895 received.)

2     BY MR. UITERWYK:

3         Q.   And can you read to the jury what the

4     conclusions were of the Surgeon General in 2010?

5         A.   "Nicotine addiction is the fundamental reason

6     that individuals persist in using tobacco products, and

7     this persistent tobacco use contributes to many

8     diseases described in this report."

9         Q.   And in your opinion, is this the reason

10     Jackie Loyd continued to smoke?

11          A.   Yes, it is.

12         Q.   Now, let's talk about some of the industry --

13     cigarette industry documents, in particular the

14     defendants' documents. And let's look at 4790 -- well,

15     let me -- 4791, let's talk about, which is titled

16     "Research Planning Memorandum on the Nature of the

17     Tobacco Business and the Crucial Role of Nicotine

18     Therein," by Claude Teague.

19              Are you familiar with that document?

20         A.   I am. It's a 1972 document by Dr. Teague.

21          Q.   Who was Dr. Teague?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=162
22         A.   He was a chemist. He had been hired by the

23     R.J. Reynolds Company in 1951. He rose up the ranks to

24     a senior management position.

25              In the early 1970s, when he authored this 2796

1     particular memorandum, he was involved in their new

2     product development aspect of their business. He was a

3     chemist by training.

4         Q.   And is this one of the documents that you

5     have researched and been looking at and actually

6     obtained in connection with your archives?

7         A.   Yes.

8              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, in connection with

9         the witness's testimony, I would like to offer and

10         introduce into evidence 4791.

11               THE COURT: Any additional objections?

12              MR. WALKER: No additional, Your Honor.

13              THE COURT: All right. The exhibit will be

14         received in evidence.

15              (Exhibit No. PT 4791 received.)

16              MR. UITERWYK: Let's if we could, Baron, put

17         4791 on the screen.

18     BY MR. UITERWYK:

19         Q.   Again, is this a document which is marked

20     "confidential"?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   And can you give the jury basically a brief

23     outline of what this document is about?

24         A.   It's basically about the -- why people smoke,

25     why they continue to smoke, the importance of nicotine 2797

1     in that process, and engineering new products to give

2     smokers what they're looking for, which is the proper

3     dose of nicotine in an attractive form. And it

4     outlines at the end a series of research initiatives

5     that R.J. Reynolds should be undertaking to basically

6     maximize their profitability in selling nicotine.

7         Q.   By the way, we've talked about and we're

8     going to be talking about a lot of documents. And you

9     talked about millions of documents you've been involved

10     in.

11              We would be here for actually a couple of

12     years if we looked at the documents, all of them,

13     correct?

14         A.   You probably couldn't. I mean, there's

15     60 million pages of documents, but --

16         Q.   What have you selected to show to the jury

17     during the course of today?

18         A.   Well, I've selected documents in the area of

19     what companies knew about and how they used that

20     information in product design around nicotine

21      addiction, you know, what they knew about the health

22     risks and when they knew it, as well as what they were

23     telling the public. And there's just really a sampling

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=163
24     of those documents. There are many more documents that

25     say essentially the same thing. So it's just a --2798

1          Q.   Is this a representative sample?

2         A.   I believe it is. I've not ever seen a

3     document that said nicotine was not the reason that

4     people smoke from the companies.

5         Q.   Let's go to page 3.

6              Doctor, I'm going to read that. And this is

7     from -- it's an RJR document, confidential document,

8     correct?

9         A.   That's right.

10         Q.   "In a sense, the tobacco industry may be

11      thought of as being a specialized, highly ritualized

12     and stylized segment of the pharmaceutical industry.

13     Tobacco products uniquely contain and deliver nicotine,

14     a potent drug with a variety of physiological effects."

15              Let me stop.

16              Physiological effects are what?

17         A.   Well, they're talking about the effects in

18     the brain that's causing a release of neurotransmitters

19     which affect how you feel as well as physical things

20     like heart rate and pulse rate --

21               MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, the

22         meaning and intent order as to the answer, not the

23         question.

24              THE COURT: He can testify -- he's qualified

25         to testify what physiological means. Overruled. 2799

1     BY MR. UITERWYK:

2         Q.   Were you done?

3         A.   Yes.

4         Q.   Okay. "Related alkaloids and probably other

5     compounds with the desired physiological effects are

6     also present in tobacco and/or its smoke. Nicotine is

7     known to be a habit-forming alkaloid; hence, the

8     confirmed user of tobacco products is primarily seeking

9     the physiological satisfaction derived from nicotine

10     and perhaps some other compounds."

11               Did I read that right?

12         A.   Yeah.

13         Q.   And we talked earlier, I believe, or

14     yesterday when -- based on your research, have you

15     determined when the cigarette companies use the term

16     "seeking the psychological satisfaction," what they

17     mean by that term?

18              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, meaning

19         and intent order.

20              THE COURT: All right. Approach, please.

21               (At sidebar.)

22              THE COURT: There is a difference in my mind

23         between -- push a little bit closer so the jurors

24         don't see my lips.

25              There's a difference in my mind between the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=164
2800

1         witness explaining words that have an ordinary

2         meaning versus words that don't and have a meaning

3         that is specialized with respect to his specialty

4         or the industry in general. Because words can be

5         used differently and have a different meaning than

6         the ordinary meaning. And you need to ask him

7         that in terms of whether or not these words have

8         any specialized meaning in his field or in the

9         field of --

10              MR. UITERWYK: I understand.

11               THE COURT: --1 forgot the -- what's his

12         specialty?

13              MR. UITERWYK: It's public health. But he

14         was talking about smoking and health.

15              THE COURT: Yeah.

16              MR. UITERWYK: And the industry--

17              THE COURT: I forgot the technical name for

18         his --

19              MR. WALKER: Public health?

20              THE COURT: There's some other word I was

21          searching for, but it doesn't matter. Otherwise,

22         I'm going to sustain the objection.

23              MR. UITERWYK: I was trying to shorten the

24         time. That's all.

25              THE COURT: All right. Well, you need to --2801

1              MR. WALKER: I'm a little concerned. If

2         there's some other document that defines those

3         terms, then he should show it. He shouldn't just

4         ask it. Because this witness is going to say

5         whatever he has to say to give that opinion.

6              THE COURT: If he says -- if the word has

7         some specialized meaning and he's -- and he can

8         lay a predicate to that, I'm going to allow him to

9         testify. Otherwise if it's an ordinary word--if

10         it's the color blue and it means blue, then he

11          can't say blue means blue. But if blue really

12         means yellow in the industry, then he's entitled

13         to testify to that.

14              MR. UITERWYK: I don't think the common

15         person knows the term "psychological

16         satisfaction."

17              THE COURT: I've ruled on that one, but I

18         mean, as to these others, then you have to lay the

19         predicate for it.

20              MR. WALKER: Can I just raise one issue?

21          There's a difference between explaining what a

22         word might mean and saying, What does that mean?

23         What is this person saying?

24              THE COURT: I agree with that.

25              MR. UITERWYK: I'm not saying that. 2802

1             THE COURT: I'm saying specifically if he

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=165
2         lays the predicate, he can ask him what it means.

3              MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

4              (Sidebar concluded.)

5     BY MR. UITERWYK:

6         Q.   As part of your expertise and research, do

7     you come across phrases and have you come across

8     phrases like "psychological satisfaction"?

9         A.   Yes.

10         Q.   And have you evaluated what psychological

11      satisfaction means within the industry as it relates to

12     smoking, nicotine, and addiction?

13         A.   I have.

14         Q.   Tell the jury about psychological

15     satisfaction.

16              MR. WALKER: Same objection.

17              THE COURT: Overruled.

18              THE WITNESS: The word satisfaction,

19         pleasure, those were terms that were associated

20         with the delivery of nicotine to smokers.

21      BY MR. UITERWYK:

22         Q.   All right. Let's go on with this document,

23     please.

24              And did Dr. Teague -- actually at that time

25     Claude Teague -- put, "Thus, a tobacco product is in 2803

1      essence a vehicle for the delivery of nicotine designed

2     to deliver the nicotine in a generally acceptable and

3     attractive form." Is that the first time you've seen

4     notations like that with regards to that?

5         A.   No. I've seen other statements that are

6     identical to this in other internal business records

7     from the defendants.

8         Q.   "Our industry is then based upon the design,

9     manufacture, and sale of an attractive dosage form of

10     nicotine." And "dosage form of nicotine," is that what

11      we were talking about, the puffs?

12         A.   Well, it's the amount of nicotine that would

13     be delivered to the smoker. So they're talking about

14     the dose of the drug that would reach the smoker and

15     making sure they have the sufficient amount of nicotine

16     to keep them satisfied.

17              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, meaning

18         and intent. Move to strike.

19              THE COURT: Overruled.

20     BY MR. UITERWYK:

21          Q.   "And our company's position in our industry

22     is determined by our ability to produce dosage forms of

23     nicotine which have more overall value, tangible or

24     intangible, to the consumer than those of our

25     competitors." 2804

1              The manipulation in the level of nicotine and

2     pH actually -- part of their ability to produce a

3     dosage form of nicotine which has a more overall

4     valuable to the consumer than those of their

5     competitors.

6              MR. WALKER: Objection, leading.

7              THE COURT: Overruled.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   Go ahead.

10         A.   Yes. That was what their goal was in design.

11               MR. UITERWYK: Now, if we can go to the next,

12         please?

13     BY MR. UITERWYK:

14         Q.   "Happily for the tobacco industry, nicotine

15     is both habituating and unique in its variety of

16     physiological actions; hence, no other active material

17     or combination of materials provides equivalent

18     satisfaction?"

19              MR. UITERWYK: Let's go on.

20     BY MR. UITERWYK:

21          Q.   "If nicotine is the sine qua non of tobacco

22     products" -- let me stop there. What does it mean by

23      "sine qua non"?

24         A.   It's the essential element.

25         Q.   So if nicotine is the essential element "of 2805

1     tobacco products and tobacco products are recognized as

2     being attractive dosage forms of nicotine, then it is

3     logical to design our products, and where possible our

4     advertising, around nicotine delivery rather than the

5     tar delivery or flavor." Did I read that correctly?

6         A.   You did.

7         Q.   And did they, in fact, design their products

8     and advertising around nicotine delivery rather than

9     delivery of flavor?

10         A.   Yes, they did.

11          Q.   Tar delivery of flavor?

12         A.   Correct.

13         Q.   Now, going on to page 6. Is that where you

14     are?

15         A.   Right.

16              MR. UITERWYK: I can't see it.

17     BY MR. UITERWYK:

18         Q.   "If what we have said about the habituated

19     smoker is true, then products designed for him should

20     emphasize nicotine, nicotine delivery efficiency,

21      nicotine satisfaction and the like. What we should

22     really make and sell would be the proper dosage of

23     nicotine with as many other built-in attractions and

24     gratifications as possible; that is, an efficient

25     nicotine delivery system with satisfactory flavor, 2806

1     mildness, convenience, cost, et cetera."

2              Did they, in fact, design their cigarettes

3     and manipulate them and engineer them to provide the

4     proper dosage of nicotine, an efficient delivery of

5     nicotine with satisfactory flavor, mildness,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=167
6     convenience, cost, et cetera?

7         A.   They did.

8         Q.   All right. I'm going to go ahead and skip

9     the next line.

10              "We have deliberately played down the role of

11      nicotine; hence, the nonsmoker has little or no

12     knowledge of what satisfactions it may offer him and no

13     desire to try it. Instead, we somehow must convince

14     him with wholly irrational reasons that he should try

15     smoking, in the hope that he will all for himself then

16     discover the real satisfactions obtainable."

17              What did they do -- what did they offer the

18     nonsmoker or the pre-smoker that they referred to there

19     to convince him with wholly rational reasons that he

20     should try smoking?

21          A.   Well, their marketing, basically, was

22     directed at the new target audience of young people.

23     And they used celebrities and sports stars and

24     television and print ads and all kinds of gimmicks

25     basically to make smoking look attractive and a fun 2807

1     thing to try, the rite of passage for many young people

2     growing up. And many of those people got hooked. And

3     then once they got hooked, they were smoking for

4     nicotine.

5         Q.   And did they conclude at that time, "If, as

6     proposed above, nicotine is the sine qua non of

7     smoking, and if we meekly accept the allegations of our

8     critics and move toward reduction or elimination of

9     nicotine from our products, then we shall eventually

10     liquidate our business."

11               Did they move toward reduction or elimination

12     of nicotine in the products that were being marketed

13     during this time frame?

14         A.   No, they did not. The so-called low nicotine

15     cigarettes had sufficient amount of nicotine in the rod

16     that the smoker could extract so they would maintain

17     their smoking. So they were very concerned about

18     studying the minimum amount of nicotine below which

19     they weren't going to go. Because otherwise, that

20     would allow the addicted smoker to be able to quit,

21      which is actually part of their research agenda on page

22     8-

23         Q.   I was looking for that.

24         A.   --of the document.

25         Q.   Which page are you at? 2808

1         A.   Page 8.

2         Q.   Let me move quickly going through this.

3              Did they, in fact, determine the minimum

4     amount of nicotine to sustain and maintain addiction?

5         A.   Yes. They studied the minimum amount. Yes,

6     they did.

7         Q.   And did they design their cigarettes with

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=168
8     that minimum amount to -- so they would stay in

9     business and sustain -- and cause to sustain addiction?

10         A.   That was part of the design features of the

11      American cigarette. Yes, they did.

12         Q.   All right. Let's look at one more cigarette

13     industry document about why people smoke. And this is

14     PT 2105.

15              MR. UITERWYK: And don't put it up there yet.

16     BY MR. UITERWYK:

17         Q.   It's the working hypothesis, the GP working

18     hypothesis from RJR, dated 1/1/1982. Are you familiar

19     with that document?

20         A.   Yes.

21               THE COURT: Which tab number, Mr. Uiterwyk?

22              MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry, Your Honor. Tab

23         58. PT2105.

24     BY MR. UITERWYK:

25         Q.   And briefly, to lay a foundation for this 2809

1      document, can you tell the jury what this document is

2     about, who wrote it, what company, and so forth?

3         A.   This is a Reynolds document. Project GP was

4     part of their R&D occurring in the late 70s, into the

5     early '80s, where they were doing basically

6     manipulations of their cigarettes and comparing how

7     consumers responded to different changes in their

8     product.

9              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, as to the

10         testimony about the document before it's admitted.

11               THE COURT: Sustained.

12              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'm going to offer

13         it into evidence as PT 2105.

14              THE COURT: Any other objections?

15              MR. WALKER: Lack of a predicate, Judge.

16              THE COURT: You're going to have to work

17         more.

18              MR. UITERWYK: I understand.

19     BY MR. UITERWYK:

20         Q.   Doctor, how are you familiar with this

21      document?

22         A.   Because I've studied project GP and documents

23     related to it, and this is just one of the documents.

24         Q.   How do you know that this project GP is an

25     RJR project? 2810

1         A.   Because the other documents -- there's two

2     reasons. One, it came off the R.J. Reynolds website.

3     Number two, the other documents for project GP have

4     R.J. Reynolds scientists who are listed on it. So

5     that's how I know it's a Reynolds project.

6         Q.   And how do we know that this document is a

7     Reynolds document?

8         A.   For those two reasons. Both the numbering on

9     the document, the fact that it came off the R.J.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=169
10     Reynolds website, and it's got a title, "Project GP."

11          Q.   Is that a project that you're familiar with

12     being done by Reynolds?

13         A.   Yes.

14              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, again, I would

15         like to offer it into evidence, PT 2105

16              MR. WALKER: Same objection, Your Honor. I

17         would ask to be heard.

18              THE COURT: Okay. I need a time frame on it.

19              MR. UITERWYK: All right.

20     BY MR. UITERWYK:

21          Q.   Do you know the time frame, Doctor?

22         A.   Yes. I've seen Project GP dating from the

23     late 1970s, 1979 through 1984.

24         Q.   Do you know the time of this document?

25         A.   I believe this document -- this does not have 2811

1      a date on this particular document, so it's in that

2     time frame, but I can't give a precise date since there

3     is not one on the document itself.

4              THE COURT: All right. Your objections are

5         overruled. It will be received.

6              (Exhibit No. PT 2105 received.)

7     BY MR. UITERWYK:

8         Q.   You know what? To save time we're going to

9     talk -- can you tell what the document concludes, and

10     rather than going over details, save some time?

11          A.   These are working hypotheses for the studies

12     that they were planning as part of this project. And

13     that's what this particular document is, listing a

14     variety of hypotheses.

15         Q.   Part of the study that they were doing, were

16     they making sure that the -- early on that they -- that

17     the delivery of the nicotine properly was the key?

18         A.   Yes.

19         Q.   And did they -- strike that.

20              And the knowledge that RJR had in this area

21      with regard to the cigarette or dosage form of

22     nicotine, basically a perfect drug delivery device, was

23     that similar to knowledge that other cigarette

24     manufacturers had, including Lorillard and others?

25         A.   Yes. 2812

1              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor,

2         argumentative.

3              THE COURT: Overruled.

4              THE WITNESS: Yes, it is.

5     BY MR. UITERWYK:

6         Q.   Was this kind of information about the

7     cigarette being a drug delivery device in a perfect or

8     ideal dosage in order to sustain and maintain

9     addiction, was it something that was repeated over and

10     over again in the decades from the '50s leading up to

11      the'90s?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=170
12              MR. WALKER: Same objection.

13              THE WITNESS: In the internal -

14              THE COURT: Overruled.

15              THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.

16     BY MR. UITERWYK:

17         Q.   In the internal records ?

18         A.   In the internal records, yes.

19         Q.   All right. Now let me change directions if

20     we could, please.

21               MR. UITERWYK: If I could, Your Honor, I need

22         to get the board -- the easel.

23              THE COURT: Yes.

24              MR. UITERWYK: If you could put that, Baron,

25         also, on the screen so I can put this up here. 2813

1              THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk, are you going to be

2         writing on that?

3              MR. UITERWYK: No, I'm not. I'm going to use

4         it as an easel.

5              THE COURT: I can't see it, so I'm asking

6         questions. Are there other things already written

7         on it?

8              MR. UITERWYK: On the board, yes. We're

9         going to view the board, Your Honor, and I have

10         had Baron put the board also on the screen so you

11          can see it and the witness can see it at the same

12         time.

13              THE COURT: You can't put it on the big

14         screen?

15              MR. UITERWYK: Yeah, but I'm going to be

16         going to other documents while talking about this

17         one. Let me try to do it another way, Judge.

18              THE COURT: Okay. I just need you at the

19         podium while that's over there.

20              MR. UITERWYK: I'm going to be at the podium.

21               THE COURT: Okay.

22              MR. UITERWYK: I don't think we found a

23         practical place to put this.

24              THE COURT: I don't need to see it. As long

25         as the jury can see it and the witness can see it, 2814

1         that's fine.

2              MR. UITERWYK: Can I ask the jury if they can

3         see it, Judge?

4              THE COURT: Sure.

5              MR. UITERWYK: Can you see that all right?

6              UNIDENTIFIED JUROR: The monitor is in the

7         way.

8              MR. UITERWYK: Put it here. Baron, put it

9         right here. They can't see it.

10              UNIDENTIFIED JUROR: I can see it on the

11          screen. That's fine.

12              THE COURT: It's on the screen.

13              MR. UITERWYK: But I'm going to be moving

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=171
14         back and forth from it.

15              MR. TRENTALANGE: Where do you want it?

16              MR. UITERWYK: Right here.

17              MR. PEDROSA: Is it all right that I move?

18              THE COURT: That's fine. It's already on the

19         screen, but if you want -- counsel is free to move

20         about as they so wish.

21               MR. PEDROSA: Thank you.

22              MR. UITERWYK: Can you see that now?

23              UNIDENTIFIED JUROR: Uh-huh. (Indicates

24         affirmatively.)

25              MR. UITERWYK: Sorry, Your Honor. 2815

1              THE COURT: That's okay.

2              MR. UITERWYK: How about now?

3              UNIDENTIFIED JUROR: That works.

4     BY MR. UITERWYK:

5         Q.   Now, Dr. Cummings, in order to further

6     understand how Jackie Loyd's addiction to cigarettes

7     containing nicotine was caused and sustained by the

8     defendants and caused her to develop her COPD and lung

9     cancer, would it be helpful for the jury to understand

10     the creation and development of the modern cigarette?

11          A.   Yes.

12         Q.   And let's look at this board. I want you to

13     go through it quickly, and then we're going to go back

14     to each portion and discuss it, if we could.

15         A.   Sure. Basically, the rise of cigarette

16     smoking in this country and then the subsequent rise in

17     the diseases, COPD and lung cancer, related to

18     cigarette smoking parallel changes that are outlined on

19     this slide; changes in the tobacco processing and

20     manufacture of the product, specifically --

21          Q.   We're going to get into each individual item.

22         A.   Okay. The introduction of reconstitution of

23     tobacco that's used in making cigarettes today. There

24     were certainly external events that helped promote the

25     adoption of smoking in this country, specifically World 2816

1     War I and II. Mass marketing had a huge impact. The

2     discovery of the health hazards, certainly, has had an

3     impact on trends in tobacco use. And then as I've

4     described, the 50-year cover-up and the public

5     statements from the companies and their affiliated

6     organizations, you know, basically denying the health

7     risks of smoking over, you know, basically from the

8     early '50s through the end of 2000.

9         Q.   All right. And then will we be talking also

10     to understand how they got the teenager to smoke

11      through marketing and advertising that we've talked

12     about somewhat?

13         A.   Yes. That's been a main theme dating back,

14     you know, to basically into the '20s. Going after

15     young people to get them to smoke and --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=172
16         Q.   Will we also be talking about -- which we've

17     discussed and we'll be looking at documents regarding

18     the design, engineering, and manipulation of the

19     cigarette to make it a perfect drug delivery device and

20     effective smokers -- smoker addiction, relapse and

21      choice?

22              MR. BROCK: Objection. Repetitive.

23              THE COURT: Overruled.

24              THE WITNESS: Yes, we will.

25     BY MR. UITERWYK: 2817

1          Q.   Now let's start with the first item, "History

2     of the development of the modern cigarette and increase

3     in sales."

4              I believe the jury heard early on that, in

5     fact, the cigarettes weren't always smoked in this

6     country and how lung cancer was very rare. Can you --

7     is that true, Doctor?

8         A.   Yeah. There were fewer than 200 deaths from

9     lung cancer, for example, at the turn of the 20th

10     century. Today, there are about 160,000 deaths from

11      lung cancer every year. So --

12         Q.   Can we actually show a board -- show a slide

13     on that? Cigarette Consumption, Lung Cancer and

14     Historical Events.

15              And did you help prepare this particular

16     document?

17         A.   I did.

18              MR. UITERWYK: Can you blow it up a little

19         bit more?

21          Q.   And can you explain what we see on that

22     document? And first of all, there's a black line --

23     and we'll go over the other items a little later. But

24     there's a black line and there is a, I guess, orange

25     line in that document. It starts around the 1900s, the 2818

1     black line. And then the orange line starts in the

2      1930s. The black line is what?

3         A.   The black line is per capita cigarette

4     consumption. So that's the number of cigarettes sold

5     to 18-and-older adults in the United States. So it's

6     per capita, so you would adjust for population size.

7     And you can see it's very low in the beginning of

8     the --

9         Q.   Do you need the pointer, Doctor?

10         A.   Sure.

11               MR. UITERWYK: May I, Your Honor?

12     BY MR. UITERWYK:

13         Q.   Can you see it there or not?

14         A.   Yeah, I can. I've just got to figure out how

15     to use the pointer.

16              You can see it's very low right here at the

17     turn of the century. The predominant forms of tobacco

18     being used right around the turn of the 20th century

19     were cigars, pipe tobacco, chewing tobacco, cigarette

20     use had not really taken off. There were cigarettes.

21               The automated cigarette making machinery was

22     created in the late 1880s but, you know, really hadn't

23     taken off because of the blending of the product made

24     it hard to inhale.

25         Q.   And then the black line being the per capita, 2819

1      and then the orange line is what?

2         A.   The orange line is -- that's from lung

3     cancer. Obviously, there are deaths back here, but

4     really, as you can see, it took off beginning in the

5     late 1920s and then accelerated through the century.

6     And that's about a 10- to 15-year lag from the rise in

7     cigarette use.

8         Q.   Why is that?

9         A.   Well, you know, the duration of exposure

10     makes a difference. So there's a lag time between the

11      exposure that you see from smoking and the diseases,

12     almost the same line, by the way, with COPD deaths as

13     well.

14         Q.   All right. Now, quickly, where did Jackie

15     Loydfitinthis?

16         A.   She was born in 1935, and she started smoking

17     in the early 1950s, and -- which is indicated, you

18     know, here. And then, you know, she switches over

19     early on to Winston cigarettes.

20              Filtered cigarettes started to take off in

21      the early 1950s, particularly with the introduction of

22     Winston cigarettes. Marlboro came in in the same year.

23              And you can see there's a little dip in per

24     capita consumption that occurred in the early '50s

25     associated with that early information coming out on 2820

1     the health risks of smoking, some publicity about that.

2     The industry responded by putting the filters on their

3     cigarettes, accelerating their advertising, and per

4     capita consumption actually peaked in 1966. And then

5     it began to fall in the latter part.

6              You can see as the information changed

7     there's some events up here. And as you can see, she

8     quit smoking in 1993 -- December of 1993. And she was

9     diagnosed in '91 with COPD.

10         Q.   All right. Now, let's go over the items

11      under Item 1(A), which I believe is changes in tobacco

12     processing and manufacturing. Can you -- you touched

13     on this when you started talking about the rise in the

14     sale of cigarettes and people smoking cigarettes. Can

15     you explain that, what happened?

16         A.   Sure.

17         Q.   Why did they do it and what they did?

18         A.   What happened was the creation of a

19     blended -- the U.S. blended cigarette and,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=174
20     particularly, the incorporation of flue-cured tobacco

21      where they use heat to cure the tobacco. Rather than

22     just letting the leaves dry out in the air, they used

23     barns where they'd actually have a heat source, a flue

24     like a chimney, going through the barn. It would speed

25     up the process of curing the leaves, and it gave the 2821

1     tobacco a different character of changing the pH.

2              The flue-cured tobacco was incorporated in a

3     product called Camel cigarettes. That was introduced

4     in 1913. And the introduction of flue-cured tobacco --

5         Q.   Hold on, Doctor, we've got the wrong slide up

6     there.

7         A.   Yes.

8         Q.   Okay.

9         A.   This is a picture of the flue-curing.

10         Q.   And when they flue-cured, why did that hasten

11      the development of the modern cigarette?

12         A.   It made it possible with the addition of

13     flue-cured with the burley tobacco, which has a little

14     bit more bite, higher nicotine to it, harsh to inhale.

15     And Turkish tobacco, which doesn't have very much

16     nicotine in it, was fairly mild and inhalable, but

17     lacked the nicotine.

18              When they could put a less harsh flue-cured

19     tobacco in with those other two types and created a

20     blend, it made it possible for smokers to inhale, and

21      they started to smoke more frequently because they

22     became addicted. They started to sell more cigarettes,

23     and cigarettes began to replace the other forms of

24     tobacco as the predominant form.

25         Q.   Is this basically the start of the design, 2822

1      engineering, and manipulation we've been talking about?

2              MR. WALKER: Objection, leading.

3              THE COURT: Sustained.

4     BY MR. UITERWYK:

5         Q.   How does this -- where does this go on the

6     line as to when they started and when they continued on

7     the design, engineering, and manipulation?

8         A.   The introduction of blending of flue-cured

9     with burley and Turkish tobacco was the beginning of

10     the designing of cigarettes for features such as

11      inhalation which facilitated addiction.

12         Q.   And we also have up there, you mentioned the

13     term "blending." Can you explain what they've done and

14     continue to do with blending to adjust the level of the

15     harshness and adjust the level of nicotine to deliver

16     the ideal level?

17              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, design.

18              THE COURT: Sir?

19              MR. PEDROSA: I said objection, design.

20              MR. UITERWYK: To cause and sustain

21          addiction.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=175
22              THE COURT: Overruled.

23              THE WITNESS: They basically would blend the

24         different tobaccos. Bright tobacco is the

25         flue-cured tobacco. And in the early 1950s, they 2823

1         incorporated reconstituted tobacco in their

2         product as well.

3              Reconstituted tobacco are the stems and

4         stalks, as well as leaves, that are basically

5         ground up. They put it through an extraction

6         process and remove all the nicotine and color in

7         the product, like making a piece of paper from

8         wood pulp, it's the same process. And then they

9         will reapply nicotine and coloring on the sheet in

10         a uniform dose.

11      BY MR. UITERWYK:

12         Q.   Let me stop you, Doctor.

13              Did they, in fact, remove all the nicotine?

14         A.   Yes. They've had the capability of removing

15     nicotine through extraction methods dating back to the

16     '20s.

17         Q.   After they removed it in the reconstituted

18     tobacco, you said they -- did they put it back in?

19         A.   Yes. They sprayed it back in on the sheet.

20     Because if you take tobacco leaves just off the plant,

21      you can cure it; the amount of nicotine from one part

22     of the leaf to the next will vary tremendously. So in

23     order to get precise dosing of nicotine, if you can do

24     this reconstitution process and spray the nicotine in a

25     uniform way over the sheet, it allows the companies to 2824

1     then control more precisely the amount of nicotine

2     that's in the product. And --

3         Q.   For what purpose?

4         A.   Well, there are two purposes for

5     reconstitution. One, it's cheaper because they reuse

6     tobacco. It's not salt. So they'll take tobacco that

7     dries out on the shelf at the store, it doesn't get

8     tossed out, it goes back to the plant, and they'll

9     reconstitute it again.

10              Number two, they can use the stems and

11      stalks, things that used to get discarded when they

12     would take the leaf off the tobacco plant. So it's

13     cost. Economics is one. And number two, very

14     importantly, it allows the control of the delivery of

15     nicotine and flavors in the product because the

16     reconstitution, you add the nicotine back in the

17     precise dose. Also, the use of various additives that

18     are put in can facilitate nicotine.

19         Q.   You used the word "precise dose."

20         A.   Yes.

21          Q.   What is a precise dose?

22         A.   Well, if you just take tobacco leaves off a

23     plant and you chop them up, there's no way you can

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=176
24     guarantee in every stick that you might roll that you

25     would get the same amount of nicotine in every 2825

1      cigarette stick. But you do when you buy a pack of

2     cigarettes. It's -- the quality control is set so the

3     smoker gets the precise amount of nicotine. You might

4     get in some sticks a wallop of nicotine; in others,

5     hardly any. That would not sustain smoking.

6              So they control through blending, through the

7     use of this man-made reconstituted tobacco, you know,

8     the engineering -- the product band cast, by the way,

9     is just another type of reconstituted tobacco. There

10     are different methods that are used.

11          Q.   Particularly with regard to -- let's talk

12     about -- you have Winstons up there, and I might as

13     well talk about it when we're talking about blending.

14              And what did they do with Winston when it

15     came out in 1954? And we're going to be going over

16     this a little bit more in detail later on, but what did

17     they do with the blending of Winston to -- to cause and

18     sustain addiction for people who started to smoke?

19         A.   They changed the blend from their flagship,

20     which was Camel at the time, and they created what they

21      referred to as the filter blend in Winston cigarettes.

22     And it was basically utilizing a mix of different kinds

23     of tobacco that gave the smoker -- because now you have

24     a filter they had to smoke it through -- a little bit

25     more nicotine. 2826

1          Q.   All right. Let's go back to the history for

2     a moment. And we've discussed the changes in the

3     tobacco processing and manufacturing, the blending.

4     We've just discussed the reconstitution of the tobacco

5     product.

6              What effect did World War I and World War II

7     have as it relates to the development of the modern

8     cigarette?

9         A.   Well, basically, most of the soldiers that

10     went off to World War I --

11          Q.   I'm going to interrupt you, because I did

12     forget one thing.

13         A.   Sure.

14         Q.   Did -- at some point in time, did the method

15     of manufacturing the cigarette change where they could

16     now mass produce it?

17         A.   Yes.

18         Q.   Tell the jury about that before we get to

19     World War I and World War II.

20         A.   Sure. The Bonsack smoking machine was

21      introduced and created, actually invented, in the late

22      1880s, or mid 1880s -- John Bonsack. And it was --

23     actually, the rights to that machine were purchased by

24     Buck Duke, who was the president of the American

25     Tobacco.

2827

1          Q.   I don't mean to cut you off, but I need you

2     to kind of shorten it.

3         A.   Sure.

4         Q.   We're on a time constraint.

5         A.   Yeah. Before this time, they had people

6     rolling cigarettes. Very expensive to do. They

7     created a machine; you could make cigarettes rapidly in

8     an automated fashion. This changed the manufacture and

9     the ability to provide individual cigarettes in packs

10     to smokers. And that dramatically changed the ability

11      to cheaply produce cigarettes.

12         Q.   And is that -- after that Bonsack machine, is

13     that when they started with the idea of the blending of

14     the reconstitution in order to control the level of the

15     nicotine and give a perfect dosage to the smoker?

16         A.   Yeah. The first really successful blended

17     cigarette was Camel. That was introduced in 1913,

18     followed by Lucky Strike, introduced in 1916, and a

19     reformulation of Chesterfield in 1918. And those three

20     brands dominated the market up until the early 1940s.

21      And then you had a few other brands like Pall Mall that

22     came in.

23         Q.   And, Doctor, we were going back to World

24     War I and World War II.

25              What happened during World War I and World 2828

1     War II which basically affected the level of smoking in

2     this country?

3              MR. WALKER: Objection, relevance.

4              THE COURT: Overruled.

5              THE WITNESS: It basically gave us -- the

6         soldiers free packs of cigarettes. And -- because

7         it actually was easier to send. And they stayed

8         fresher in the packs than cigars and chewing

9         tobacco, which had been the predominant form of

10         tobacco. And, of course, you have to remember

11          they were shipping this overseas in ships, and it

12         would take weeks for them to get to the soldiers.

13     BY MR. UITERWYK:

14         Q.   What happened when the soldiers came back

15     after either one of those wars?

16         A.   Well, they came back in World War I, and they

17     were addicted to cigarettes. And they took up

18     cigarettes in large numbers. And then women, about ten

19     years later, started to take up cigarette smoking in

20     large numbers.

21          Q.   All right. And, Doctor, the next item on the

22     board is mass marketing and competition.

23              Can you explain to the jury why you have that

24     there?

25         A.   Sure. I mentioned Buck Duke. It's a little 2829

1     odd history. He had bought the rights to the Bonsack

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=178
2     machines.

3              American Tobacco pretty much had cornered the

4     market. They were sued for antitrust issues in 1907

5     and 1911. They broke up the company. They created

6     Lorillard. Reynolds actually had been bought off, a

7     good share of Reynolds, by American Tobacco. They were

8     split off. And then you had competition.

9              And then as competition comes along, more

10     people, particularly men early on and then later women,

11      took up smoking cigarettes. The companies began to

12     spend huge amounts of money to market their cigarettes,

13     and that certainly contributed to the uptake of smoking

14     in this country.

15              MR. UITERWYK: All right. Let's go back to

16         the slide -- the historical slide, if we could,

17         please. The cigarette consumption, lung cancer

18         historical slide.

19     BY MR. UITERWYK:

20         Q.   Now, on the right-hand side of that slide,

21      you have -- in correlation to the orange line, you have

22     the -- what is that level?

23         A.   These are deaths from lung cancer on the

24     right side.

25         Q.   And so did it basically go from zero to -- is 2830

1     that how many -- is that in millions or is that what?

2         A.   Well, lung cancer deaths today in absolute

3     numbers is over 160,000 deaths this year from lung

4     cancer. And in the early part of the 20th century it

5     was less than 200 deaths.

6         Q.   Why didn't they have lung cancer before the

7     rise of the modern cigarette?

8         A.   Because people weren't inhaling smoke into

9     their lungs. People were smoking cigars and pipes, but

10     for the most part, that tobacco was being held in the

11      mouth. Even cigarettes at that point with the burley

12     blend was hard to inhale.

13              So when they made an inhalable product and

14     they started to mass market it, specifically with

15     Camel, Lucky Strike, and Chesterfield, the cigarette

16     consumption goes up and so did the disease rate. So it

17     was a man-made epidemic.

18         Q.   And during the course of this manipulation

19     and so forth, did they -- at some point in time in this

20     graph, does it reflect when the hazard of smoking was

21      actually first discovered?

22         A.   Well, there are studies you can find on the

23     hazards of smoking dating back into the twenties --

24     late twenties, corresponding to the rise in lung

25     cancer. But there was a compilation of information 2831

1     that began to come out and get widely publicized in the

2     early 1950s. There were four studies in 1950 in major

3     medical journals, three in the United States and one

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=179
4     over in Great Britain.

5              And then there was additional studies, one in

6      1953 that got wide coverage with mouse painting on

7     animals where they had identified something in the

8     tobacco tar that was carcinogenic, at least in an

9     animal model.

10         Q.   And then --

11               MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I'm sorry, may we

12         approach?

13              THE COURT: Can you state the objection?

14              MR. WALKER: It relates to Your Honor's

15         ruling about use of the courtroom.

16              MR. UITERWYK: I'm doing this only to look at

17         the board, Your Honor.

18              THE COURT: Okay.

19              MR. UITERWYK: I'm not -- over here --

20              THE COURT: Why don't you move the board --

21          make -- take the easel and just move it a little

22         bit closer to the witness and stand between --

23              MR. UITERWYK: Is that all right with you?

24              THE COURT: That's fine. And just stand next

25         to the podium. 2832

1              MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

2              THE COURT: I'm sorry.

3              MR. UITERWYK: All right, Your Honor.

4     BY MR. UITERWYK:

5         Q.   On the -- we have -- you talked about the

6     hazard, and you talked about that there was some

7     publicity at that time regarding the hazard.

8              Did we see a dip in the level of smoking

9     shown on the screen during that time frame?

10         A.   Yes. I mean, it's actually sort of covered

11      up by the box there, but there was a dip in cigarette

12     sales that actually was the first dip that occurred

13     since the Great Depression in --

14         Q.   Can we see it on this slide better?

15         A.   You can. And it's right around 1952 to 1953,

16     there's a little bit of a dip there.

17         Q.   And then we see -- and I want to go through

18     this a little quickly, Doctor, because I want to speed

19     things up a little bit.

20              Did it go back up shortly thereafter?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   Why did it go back up, based on your

23     research?

24         A.   It went back up for two reasons. Number one

25     was the introduction of filtered cigarettes, which, you 2833

1     know, many smokers switched to at that time, those who

2     had been smoking nonfiltered cigarettes. And they were

3     marketed as a way of reassuring smokers they could

4     smoke and not worry about it.

5              And number two was the fact that the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=180
6     companies launched their joint public relations

7     campaign, jointly financed, basically to reassure

8     smokers that their products were not injurious to

9     health and that they were pledged to look into any

10     allegations and if there was anything wrong with their

11     product, they would fix it. That's what they told

12     people repeatedly.

13         Q.   Is that what this board is referring to as

14     the 50-year coverup and public statements from the

15     cigarette companies and their affiliated organizations?

16         A.   Yes.

17         Q.   All right. Now, the next item -- and we've

18     talked about this, so I don't want to spend a whole lot

19     of time because we'll look at some documents later --

20     getting the teenager to smoke and marketing -- through

21      marketing and advertising. We briefly touched on it

22     when we saw the Diane Burrows document 3400, PT 3400,

23     correct?

24         A.   That's right.

25         Q.   And we'll talk about it more in a minute. 2834

1              Now, during the time when they made these

2     changes in the manufacturing, the blending and the

3     reconstitution and the adjusting of the levels of

4     nicotine, did they also make other changes in the

5     design, engineering, and manipulation of the cigarette

6     to cause and sustain addiction and make it a perfect

7     drug delivery device?

8         A.   Yeah.

9         Q.   All right. And that brings us to item three

10     on the board, and that's on that issue, correct?

11          A.   Correct.

12         Q.   We have a board -- a slide up on the screen

13     that we would like to go through, if we could.

14              Did you assist in the preparation of that

15     slide?

16         A.   I did.

17         Q.   And this is what the cigarette companies did

18     in their design, engineering, and manipulation of the

19     modern cigarette in order to cause and sustain

20     addiction.

21              We talked about controlling the blend, did we

22     not?

23         A.   That's right.

24         Q.   We've also talked some, a little bit, about

25     the adjustment of pH to allow easier inhalation to 2835

1      alter the natural tobacco.

2              Can you explain -- in order to cause and

3     sustain addiction.

4         A.   Sure. In PH -

5              MR. WALKER: Objection to the design

6         testimony, Judge.

7              THE COURT: Overruled.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=181
8              THE WITNESS: PH relates directly to how

9         harsh or easy it will -- mild it will be to inhale

10         the product. So if it's too acidic, it will be

11          rejected, or if it's too basic, it will be too

12         hard to inhale. This is the reason that cigars

13         are hard to inhale, because they have a higher pH.

14         A natural midpoint -- water, for example, is a pH

15         of 7.

16              So companies can alter the pH through a

17         variety of means including the blends that they

18         use in their product. I've mentioned flue curing

19         for one. Also additives that are put in the

20         product that can control the pH --

21               MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, to the

22         additives testimony.

23              THE COURT: Overruled.

24              THE WITNESS: -- to make it easier to inhale,

25         less harsh. And that was certainly a feature that 2836

1         was important to lung delivery of nicotine and

2         also attracting people to continue to smoke,

3         because otherwise they would reject the product.

4     BY MR. UITERWYK:

5         Q.   All right. And then through this adjustment

6     of the pH, did it increase the addiction of persons,

7     cause people to be addicted and sustain the addiction

8     of people who were addicted?

9         A.   Yes.

10         Q.   And I believe we've talked about it, have we

11      not?

12         A.   Yes.

13         Q.   Now, you've also talked, I believe, about

14     controlled the nicotine level to keep it above the

15     addiction threshold. And that's what we've been

16     talking about, perfect drug delivery device, the ideal

17     level of the nicotine and so forth, correct?

18         A.   Yeah. Because a design feature in the

19     product is to maintain a minimum amount of nicotine and

20     not go below that threshold. Otherwise people would

21      not use the product.

22         Q.   All right. Before we go any further, in your

23     opinion, based on your experience, studies, and

24     research, but for their design manipulation and

25     engineering, would Ms. Loyd have been able to inhale 2837

1     those cigarettes that were sold to her?

2         A.   No.

3         Q.   In your opinion, if she couldn't inhale,

4     would she have gotten COPD and lung cancer?

5              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, not

6         disclosed.

7              THE COURT: Sustained.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   Doctor, can you get -- if you can't inhale

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=182
10     the cigarette, based on your studies and your review of

11      the epidemiological matters and your review of the

12     literatures that relate to cigarette smoking and the

13     industry documents, if you can't inhale the cigarette,

14     do you get COPD or lung cancer?

15         A.   No, not from -- you know, not from that --

16     not from the cigarette. If you can't inhale it, you

17     won't get lung cancer or COPD.

18         Q.   And but for the fact -- if she couldn't

19     inhale it, would Jackie Loyd have gotten COPD and lung

20     cancer?

21               MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. It's not

22         disclosed.

23              THE COURT: Sustained.

24              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, may we approach?

25              THE COURT: Okay. 2838

1               (At sidebar.)

2              THE COURT: Is there something you want to

3         disclose?

4              MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor. In fact, the

5         same papers we looked at the other day with

6         respect to design said that he's not going to give

7         a medical opinion, certainly not a --

8              MR. UITERWYK: He's not giving a medical

9         opinion.

10              MR. WALKER: Well, he is, because if he's

11          going to testify that she had COPD, that's a

12         medical opinion. If he's going to testify that

13         she wouldn't have gotten it but for this stuff,

14         that's a medical opinion.

15              MR. UITERWYK: If you can't inhale it -- he's

16         going to testify -- he testified if you can't

17         inhale it, you can't get a disease.

18              MR. WALKER: And I didn't object to that.

19              MR. UITERWYK: Well, that's an

20         epidemiological point of view.

21               MR. PEDROSA: He's giving a but-for cause and

22         effect medical opinion.

23              THE COURT: Well, I misunderstood your

24         objection, then. I understand your objection now,

25         but I think it is a medical opinion. 2839

1              MR. UITERWYK: I'll rephrase it later on.

2              THE COURT: Okay.

3              (Sidebar concluded.)

4              MR. UITERWYK: I'll rephrase the question,

5         Your Honor.

6              THE COURT: Okay.

7     BY MR. UITERWYK:

8         Q.   I want you to assume that Dr. Mannino has

9     testified that as a result of Jackie Loyd's smoking

10     cigarettes, that caused her to develop COPD. But for

11      her inability -- strike that.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=183
12              In your opinion, if she couldn't have

13     inhaled, would she have been able to smoke cigarettes?

14         A.   If she could not have -- she wouldn't have

15     smoked repeatedly. She wouldn't have been addicted to

16     them if she couldn't inhale it.

17         Q.   Would she have had a number of doses -- had

18     any number of doses by that?

19         A.   Not in my opinion, she would not have.

20         Q.   All right. And the same for --1 want you to

21      assume that Dr. Villa has testified that because of her

22     smoking -- that her smoking cigarettes was the

23     substantial contributing cause to her lung cancer and a

24     substantial contributing cause to her death.

25              In your opinion, if she couldn't have 2840

1     inhaled, would she have been smoking -- continued to

2     smoke?

3         A.   If she had not been able to inhale the smoke

4     from the cigarettes, she wouldn't have been addicted,

5     she wouldn't have smoked as many cigarettes. And so

6     the answer would be I don't think she would have gotten

7     the lung cancer.

8              MR. UITERWYK: All right.

9              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, move to strike.

10              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, move to

11          strike.

12              THE COURT: Sustained.

13              The jury will disregard the last portion of

14         his sentence relating to whether or not she would

15         have sustained lung cancer.

16              MR. UITERWYK: And I need to --

17              THE COURT: Go ahead.

18     BY MR. UITERWYK:

19         Q.   Okay. Doctor, assuming that she -- that

20     Dr. Villa testified that as a result of smoking it

21      caused her, in a substantial way, to develop lung

22     cancer and die, based on what you've told the jury with

23     regard to the inability to inhale had they not adjusted

24     the level of the pH and level of nicotine, Doctor, in

25     your opinion, would she have put cigarette smoke into 2841

1     her lungs and could she have inhaled -- or would she

2     have inhaled had they not manipulated and adjusted the

3     cigarette?

4              MR. WALKER: Objection, asked and answered,

5         and argumentative.

6              THE COURT: Overruled.

7              THE WITNESS: No.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   All right. Now, so, Doctor, if I walked into

10     a field -- a tobacco field in North Carolina and I

11     picked up a leaf off the tobacco -- off a plant and

12     rolled it up, stuck it on a piece of paper and then

13     somehow got a filter on the end of it, is that the same

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=184
14     cigarette that I would be smoking that RJ. Reynolds

15     and Lorillard manufactured and were selling to

16     Jacqueline Loyd?

17         A.   No.

18         Q.   Can you explain that, please?

19         A.   Well, cigarettes are highly processed. They

20     go through the curing process, which changes the

21      chemistry. There are casings and additives that are

22     put on the product that affect the product, and it's

23     also --

24              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. This is

25         design testimony. 2842

1              THE COURT: Overruled.

2              THE WITNESS: Also, the use of reconstituted

3         tobacco. So that's -- it's not anywhere close to

4         just picking off leaves, rolling them up in a

5         piece of paper and sticking a filter on it.

6              As I described, you wouldn't get precise

7         dosing of nicotine doing that.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   Now, after tobacco is cured, dried, based

10     upon your research you've done, do the cigarette

11      companies like Reynolds and Lorillard choose to add

12     additives to the tobacco that they put inside the

13     cigarette and additives to the filter and additives to

14     the paper?

15              MR. WALKER: Objection, to testimony on

16         additives and its design testimony.

17              THE COURT: Overruled.

18     BY MR. UITERWYK:

19         Q.   Go ahead.

20         A.   Yes, they do.

21          Q.   And do we have a slide reflecting how many

22     additives they do that are not natural to tobacco or

23     cigarettes?

24         A.   Yes.

25         Q.   How many additives do we have on this board? 2843

1              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, to the

2         ruling on scientific design testimony with respect

3         to-

4              THE COURT: I'm overruling it.

5              MR. WALKER: To this specific --

6              THE COURT: I thought we admitted this one.

7              MR. WALKER: We did not, Your Honor.

8              THE COURT: Okay. My error. Approach,

9         please.

10              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I need to lay a

11         predicate. That's what he --

12              THE COURT: Okay. Well, that's what I

13         thought. Okay. So lay a predicate as to -- lay a

14         predicate.

16         Q.   Now, have you participated in the preparation

17     of a slide as it relates to additives?

18         A.   Yes. My slide.

19         Q.   All right. And are you familiar with the

20     amount of additives and how these additives affect

21      smoking behavior?

22         A.   Yes, I am.

23         Q.   And have you studied and researched additives

24     and how it affects smoking behavior?

25         A.   I have. 2844

1          Q.   And have you also researched the number of

2     additives and the reason they add many of these

3     additives for the purposes of aiding in smoking

4     behavior and addiction?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   All right. And does this slide that we're

7     about to see reflect some of the additives that are not

8     natural to cigarettes?

9         A.   Well, additives are not natural. These are

10     added. And this slide is just a demonstrative to show

11      the large number of additives, around 600, that are

12     used currently in cigarette products, not all of them

13     in every brand. But this is a list of the additives

14     that the companies turn over to the government.

15              MR. UITERWYK: The jury has seen them, but

16         let's just show it one more time briefly if we

17         could, Baron.

18              MR. WALKER: Same objection.

19              THE COURT: All right. It's overruled. I

20         think a predicate has been laid.

21      BY MR. UITERWYK:

22         Q.   And is this a list of all the additives that

23     are not natural in cigarettes?

24         A.   Yes. I squeezed them on this slide. So

25     there's 600. I usually show one that has an 2845

1      alphabetical list first because you can actually read

2     the names. And it's just to illustrate there are a

3     large number.

4         Q.   All right. And did you also prepare a slide

5     that shows a more limited list of additives that we can

6     actually go over?

7         A.   Yes.

8         Q.   And based on your --

9              MR. UITERWYK: And can you show that, please,

10         Baron?

11      BY MR. UITERWYK:

12         Q.   By the way, are there additives -- before I

13     talk about these additives, are there additives in

14     connection with the manipulation of the level of the pH

15     that we talked about earlier?

16         A.   Yes.

17              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, repetitive.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=186
18              MR. WALKER: Repetitive, and Your Honor ruled

19         on this.

20              MR. UITERWYK: That was the -- that's the

21          only question I'll ask on that, Judge.

22              THE COURT: Overruled.

23     BY MR. UITERWYK:

24         Q.   All right. Are there additional additives

25     for other purposes other than adjusting the level of 2846

1     pH?

2         A.   Yes.

3         Q.   Let's go over those quickly if we could,

4     please.

5              Brown sugar. What's that for?

6         A.   Well, it imparts flavor, but it's added as a

7     casing. So a casing is when they take the leaf after

8     it's been cured and usually stored for a while, they

9     will dip it into -- or spray material on the tobacco

10     leaf to impart flavor as well as affect the moisture of

11      the product.

12         Q.   And high fructose corn syrup, I think, is one

13     of them.

14         A.   Correct.

15         Q.   What's the purpose of that?

16         A.   Again, it's just like brown sugar. It's 

17     it has a sweetness to it and a flavor. There are

18     patents from R.J. Reynolds for high fructose corn syrup

19     that were developed and used in cigarette processing.

20         Q.   And cellulose fiber, formulation aid, what do

21      you mean by that?

22         A.   Well, it's a binding aid. So it actually

23     holds the little bits of tobacco together. And the

24     size of the little leaves when they're chopped up

25     actually affect the smoke character because of the 2847

1      surface area.

2         Q.   Okay. And they have glycerol humectants?

3         A.   Yeah.

4         Q.   What is a humectant?

5         A.   Well, that's a -- it's a moisturizer. And,

6     you know, glycerol and propylene glycol are both used

7     as humectants. And they affect also the mildness of

8     the product, making it easier to inhale the particles.

9         Q.   During the time when Jackie Loyd was addicted

10     to cigarettes containing nicotine, or at any time, is

11      there anything on the pack, carton, or advertising that

12     informed the consumer what was in those cigarettes?

13              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, preemption.

14              THE COURT: Overruled.

15              THE WITNESS: Other than tobacco, no.

16     BY MR. UITERWYK:

17         Q.   And so can anyone -- like, for instance, we

18     can go get a candy bar or something like that and we

19     can look at what's in it.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=187
20              Do they have anything like that for

21      cigarettes?

22              MR. WALKER: Objection, relevance, asked and

23         answered.

24              THE COURT: Overruled.

25              THE WITNESS: No. 2848

1     BY MR. UITERWYK:

2         Q.   And does the amount of these ingredients, the

3     level of these ingredients, the additives they use for

4     the purposes of controlling pH, does that change based

5     on the particular cigarette and what they're trying to

6     do with that cigarette?

7         A.   Yes.

8         Q.   And does it change based on when a cigarette

9     was manufactured?

10         A.   Yes. It changes over time.

11          Q.   Can you explain that to the jury, how it's

12     changed? Let's use the example of Winston, how it has

13     changed over time.

14         A.   Well, Winston has changed, from internal

15     business records that I've reviewed, dramatically and

16     frequently, 28 changes in the formulation of Winston

17     cigarettes between the time it was introduced in 1954

18     right up until the early 1980s. And it included

19     changes in the amount and type of reconstituted tobacco

20     that was used, the use of other -- you know, the

21     proportion of flue-cured burley to Turkish, the use of

22     certain additives. The efficiency of the filter

23     changed. And these changes were made without knowledge

24     to consumers.

25         Q.   Now, we've discussed the manipulation, the 2849

1      additives as it relates to the pH on this. And we've

2     gone over basically the first two bullet points.

3              MR. UITERWYK: If we could have the slide on

4         cigarette manipulation.

5     BY MR. UITERWYK:

6         Q.   All right. I think we've gone over the first

7     three, have we not?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   Now -- but also in the fourth one, you have

10     added flavoring for taste, smoothness, bronchodilation

11      to overcome aversion to inhalation.

12              Can you tell the jury about what the

13     cigarette companies have done in that regard?

14         A.   Well, I mean, the flavors obviously impart

15     something that makes the product appealing and

16     affecting taste and, also, the character of the smoke

17     whether it's irritating, harsh or smooth and mild. And

18     definitely some of the additives have that effect.

19              And when you burn additives, things like

20     cocoa, for example, you actually -- it's not cocoa

21      anymore when it's burned. You get other chemical

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=188
22     byproducts from the burning of that. Some of which act

23     in a way that affect bronchial spasms in the airway.

24         Q.   What do you mean by that? How does that

25     affect the inhalability, those additives? 2850

1         A.   Essentially, a lot of the additives are

2     masking the harshness of the smoke particles, making it

3     easy so that a person can draw it deeply into their

4     lungs.

5         Q.   Are any of the additives made for the

6     purposes of making you -- to allow you to breathe

7     easier or make you feel like you're breathing easier?

8         A.   Sure.

9         Q.   Can you tell the jury about that, please?

10         A.   Well, again, things like propylene glycol

11      will have that effect, and menthol has that effect.

12         Q.   All right. The next item we have on this

13     list is "control the burn rate of the cigarette." Can

14     you explain to the jury what that's all about, what

15     they did, and what effect it had?

16         A.   Sure. You light a piece of paper with a

17     match, it goes up in a flame. You light a cigarette,

18     it burns at a specific rate and you get an ash. It's

19     not just by magic, it's by design. There are chemicals

20     that are sprayed onto the paper to control the burn

21      rate and the burn temperature so the product doesn't

22     self-extinguish on its own.

23              Like a cigar or pipe will go out because they

24     don't have those additives on the paper for the cigar

25     or in the pipe tobacco. So if you go a minute or two 2851

1     without puffing on it, you'll have to often relight the

2     product to keep it going.

3              Cigarettes will go right down the rod,

4     basically, because of the additives there. And it's

5     important because the burn temperature of the product

6     is critical to the delivery of certain chemicals in the

7     product. And cigarettes burn at a very high

8     temperature, over 800 degrees centigrade.

9         Q.   And this burn rate, how does it affect a

10     person's -- a smoker being able to inhale and how does

11      it participate in causing a sustaining addiction?

12         A.   Well, the burn temperature and the burn rate

13     effect, the character of the smoke, which you can

14     measure in terms of the pH level of the smoke. And so

15     the studies are very sophisticated, not just looking at

16     overall pH in the smoke but on a puff-by-puff basis,

17     because the cigarette rod, as it burns down, changes.

18              Because you're actually using part of the

19     tobacco as a filtering device. But when you get down

20     to the end of the cigarette, you don't have as much

21      filtering device. They actually design the cigarette

22     for literally every puff of -- puff of the way.

23         Q.   All right. And in adjusting that burn rate,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=189
24     does it also affect or will we see documents of how

25     that affects the level of carcinogens or cancer-causing 2852

1      agents that are produced by the cigarette smoke?

2         A.   Sure. The burn temperature does affect the

3     amount of byproducts that you are going to see both

4     from complete and incomplete combustion that you see.

5     Obviously, you have a whole bunch of things that happen

6     when you burn additives, as well as tobacco. And

7     adding things and burning it adds more carcinogens to

8     the mix because it's adding extra stuff to burn.

9         Q.   All right. Now, the next is "Control the

10     ventilation by controlling the porosity of the paper."

11      Can you tell the jury about this and do they need to

12     understand, in order to understand this, the FTC? Or

13     can you do it without going into that detail?

14         A.   I can do both if you want.

15         Q.   Let's try to tell it and see where we need

16     it. Let's first talk about control the ventilation by

17     controlling the porosity of the paper. How does that

18     manipulation of design and engineering affect both the

19     causing and sustaining the nicotine addiction as well

20     as the ability to -- as well as what the cigarette

21      smoker, the addicted smoker, thinks they're getting

22     versus what they are getting. And it may be -- maybe I

23     need to bring it down. Do I need to?

24         A.   I can explain it.

25         Q.   Thank you. 2853

1         A.   I think. First of all, if you measure the

2     cigarettes on a machine and smoke it in a constant way

3     on a constant rate, so many puffs and so on, you can

4     generate certain numbers; tar, nicotine, carbon

5     dioxide. People don't smoke like machines.

6              What happens when you add ventilation to the

7     paper -- so this is the paper that is used that wraps

8     around the rod of the tobacco.

9         Q.   When you say the "rod," what do you mean?

10         A.   Well, you know, if you take a cigarette

11      and --1 have a pen so that's as close as I'm going to

12     get. You know, the paper that's around the tobacco

13     that's in the center is considered the rod and then you

14     have the filter. And then over the filter you have

15     tipping paper. That's the piece of paper that's glued

16     onto the rod and around the filter. Okay? And then

17     the paper that's called tobacco wrap is basically the

18     paper that surrounds the tobacco and the product.

19              And starting the late 1950s, in an effort to

20     lower the machine yields that you would get on a

21      cigarette, they started to put ventilation holes in the

22     paper.

23         Q.   Let me stop you, Dr. Cummings, if we could.

24              You said that in order to control the levels

25     of the tar -- the nicotine that you're getting, they

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=190
2854

1     put the holes in it. From -- different from what? The

2     levels were different from what?

3         A.   They were comparing different products at

4     that point. So you would get it different than if you

5     didn't have the ventilation holes. And they introduced

6     paper that had -- was vented which would allow more

7     oxygen to circulate, which changes the burn temperature

8     because the fire is affected by the amount of oxygen

9     that's there when you're burning the cigarette. And it

10     would change the character of the smoke as well as the

11      numbers that were generated on the smoking machine.

12         Q.   Why would they do that?

13         A.   Well, you know, they were utilizing it

14     through their marketing because at this time, you know,

15     in the late '50s, more information came out about the

16     health risks of smoking, more smokers were looking for

17     products that were lower in tar and nicotine. At the

18     time the companies were putting out their own marketing

19     around that, and they were seeking ways to give lower

20     numbers for their advertising.

21          Q.   But the lower numbers that they were giving

22     in their advertising, were they accurate in the real

23     world of the smoker?

24         A.   No. The only way you really know in the real

25     world of the smoker is to measure in the smoker 2855

1     themselves. So taking a blood sample or urine sample

2     and seeing what they're actually getting exposed to.

3     And it really, the paper porosity had very limited

4     effect on 

5         Q.   Why?

6         A.   Well, it's a relatively minor design

7     modification. It does change the burn temperature

8     and -- but there are so many chemicals. And because

9     people smoke for nicotine, changing porosity of the

10     paper doesn't really matter, they're just smoking to

11      get the nicotine in the product.

12         Q.   All right. So through their design process,

13     did they know that, in fact, what the cigarette was

14     delivering versus what, in fact, the numbers said?

15         A.   Sure. The companies created human smoke

16     simulators. So they had studies going on of how people

17     actually do smoke. They created machine models to

18     measure the amount of tar and nicotine that people

19     actually would get, and they knew these modifications

20     really didn't make much difference to that.

21          Q.   Did they also -- the placement of the

22     ventilation holes, did they locate them in a certain

23     way that they may be covered up by many of the smokers?

2         think you're referring to are in the filter.

3     BY MR. UITERWYK:

4         Q.   Okay.

5         A.   And we haven't talked about the filter.

6     We're just talking about the ventilation holes in the

7     paper. Ventilation holes in the filter came into being

8     in the mid-'60s, and many of the different brands

9     adopted filter vented -- filter vents to their

10     products. And they were lasered into the filter. And

11      they would change how somebody would smoke a cigarette

12     because when you have -- without filter vents, it is

13     harder to draw the smoke. You have to take a -- you

14     know, you don't have to work as hard.

15              So if you put filter vents, it reduces

16     resistance to draw, so it sort of gives you the

17     illusion that it's easier to draw in because you're

18     mixing oxygen and air into those filter vents. But

19     actually you're taking a bigger, deeper puff, in other

20     words, drawing the smoke particles down deeper into the

21      lungs. So the introduction of the filter vents, which

22     was mainly to beat the smoking machine levels --

23     because when you smoked a cigarette with filter vents,

24     some of the tar--

1              THE COURT: Sustained.

2     BY MR. UITERWYK:

3         Q.   But we were talking about the filter vents

4     and how it affects -- did these filter vents and the

5     placement of these filter vents by the cigarette

6     companies, did it, in fact, distort what the -- not

7     distort. What I mean by that, did the cigarette smoker

8     get different levels of nicotine than was reflected on

9     the package itself?

10              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, asked and answered.

11               THE COURT: Overruled.

12              MR. WALKER: And design testimony.

13              THE COURT: Overruled.

14     BY MR. UITERWYK:

15         Q.   Go ahead.

16         A.   Yes. It was the main thing that changed the

17     numbers, tar and nicotine levels, that were advertised

18     on cigarettes.

19         Q.   So did they get more tar and more nicotine

20     with the design of the filter in the manner you just

21      discussed versus what was stated on the package?

22         A.   Yes.

23         Q.   Did the cigarette companies know that?

24         A.   Yes, they did.

25         Q.   Did they study that? 2858

1         A.   Very carefully.

2         Q.   And did they design for that specific purpose

3     intentionally?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=192
4         A.   Yes, they did.

5         Q.   For what purpose?

6         A.   Basically to sell more cigarettes, because

7     they would market their cigarettes as lower in tar and

8     nicotine even though they wouldn't really deliver to

9     the average smoker less tar and nicotine.

10         Q.   So we actually jumped a thing and we went

11      straight to the bottom which was the added filters to

12     give the illusion of filtration. Is that basically

13     what we just discussed, Dr. Cummings?

14         A.   Now, we talked about one feature of the

15     filter. The filter itself also had additional risks.

16     And the illusion is that it gave you some safety --

17              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. It's

18         design testimony.

19              THE COURT: All right. Lay a predicate,

20         please.

21               MR. UITERWYK: All right.

22     BY MR. UITERWYK:

23         Q.   Dr. Cummings, have you, in fact, studied

24     filters in-depth as it relates to how it affected

25     smoking behavior? 2859

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   And have you studied how it affected the

3     cigarette smoker in connection with the causation and

4     sustaining of addiction?

5         A.   I have.

6         Q.   Will you tell the jury, then, how -- what

7     they did to filters played a part in causing and

8     sustaining addiction to smoke and inhalability and

9     smoking behavior of the smoker of their products ?

10              MR. WALKER: Same objection, Your Honor.

11               THE COURT: Overruled.

12              THE WITNESS: Sure. The addition of a

13         filter, one, provided reassurance to smokers so

14         they would keep smoking. Number two, it actually

15         caused the smoker to change how they smoked.

16     BY MR. UITERWYK:

17         Q.   What do you mean?

18         A.   So when you put a filter on the product, you

19     have to take a bigger, deeper puff. And when you do

20     that, it actually causes you to draw smoke deeper into

21      the airways.

22         Q.   Let me stop you. When you draw smoke deeper

23     into your airways, in addition to drawing the nicotine

24     deeper into your airways, what else are you drawing

25     deeper into your airways? 2860

1         A.   The nicotine is carried on the tar particles.

2     So you're carrying the, you know, the tar which

3     contains much of the carcinogens that are in the

4     cigarettes, as well as other toxins that cause

5     inflammation in the airways.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=193
6         Q.   All right. Continue. What else did they do

7     as far as the cigarette is concerned? I'm sorry, the

8     filter.

9         A.   With the filter itself, the engineering of

10     the filter, it made the tar particles that somebody

11      would be inhaling smaller and more uniform. So the

12     smaller particles are actually more dangerous because

13     they allow the toxins to get deeper into the airways,

14     the deepest regions of the lung, and that dramatically

15     alters the disease risk that you see.

16              And finally, the filter itself, which is made

17     out of cellulose acetate that are known as photographic

18     film -- the inventor of the patent for the filter is

19     Kodak, because it's made out of the same material that

20     was used in film, painted with titanium dioxide which

21      is a white color to give it its white appearance.

22              But the tiny fibers there, some of those

23     fibers break off and can be inhaled into the lungs

24     themselves, carrying the tar on it. They call this

25      "filter fiber fallout." That was a term that the 2861

1      defendants have coined and have studied themselves as

2     we have as well.

3         Q.   All right. And the last item, the item

4     before that was control the tobacco particle size in

5     the rod. Why was that done and what effect did it have

6     on the smoking behavior?

7         A.   Well, you could actually make a product where

8     the tar particles are so large they would be rejected

9     in the airway. So in other words, they would be hard

10     to inhale it into the lungs.

11               The companies, in the late '50s, were

12     studying the deposition, in other words, the location

13     of these particles in the airway. And they made some

14     design decisions, particularly around the use of types

15     of filters that they were using, to make it smaller

16     which was more efficient for delivery of nicotine and,

17     therefore, selling more cigarettes rather than the

18     decision to make the tar particles larger and harder to

19     inhale, which would have prevented most of the diseases

20     that we see from smoking.

21          Q.   Based on your review of the records in this

22     case and based on your -- including the types and

23     brands that Jackie Loyd smoked, did these cigarette

24     companies' design, engineering, and manipulation of the

25     modern cigarette, as you've listed here, play a 2862

1      significant part in causing her to be addicted and to

2     sustain her addiction?

3         A.   Yes.

4         Q.   Now --

5              THE COURT: Let's take our -- are you at a

6         break point?

7              MR. UITERWYK: It is, Your Honor.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=194
8              THE COURT: Okay. Good. Thank you, sir.

9              Let's take our mid afternoon break. We'll be

10         in recess until three o'clock. Thank you.

11               THE BAILIFF: All rise.

12              (Jury exited the courtroom at 2:42 p.m.)

13              (Recess taken from 2:42 p.m. to 3:05 p.m.)

14              THE BAILIFF: All rise. Come to order.

15         Court's back in session.

16              THE COURT: Bring the jury in, please.

17              MR. BIGGER: Judge, before we get the jury,

18         can I just bring up --

19              MR. UITERWYK: Dr. Cummings is on the stand.

20              MR. BIGGER: I know. Dr. Cummings, if you

21          could step off.

22              Judge, there is something that we talked

23         about I feel it's important to let the Court know,

24         given the way things are going and the time it's

25         taking to do this examination. 2863

1              Dr. Cummings is going to be required to

2         testify in another case that's going on right now

3         in Fort Myers, a federal court case. They're

4         aware of that. Mr. Walker's partner,

5         Stephanie Parker from Jones Day, is the lead for

6         R.J. Reynolds. They know he's expected there as

7         well. Fortunately -- he was actually supposed to

8         be there this afternoon or tomorrow morning --

9         they're running a little behind schedule as well.

10         It's taking longer than they thought.

11               THE COURT: I'm surprised.

12              MR. BIGGER: I know. Never happens.

13         Apparently it's a retired senior judge from

14         Minnesota who's down sort of wintering in

15         Fort Myers, and he has -- anyway --

16              THE COURT: I'm also surprised.

17              MR. BIGGER: -- they're running a little

18         late.

19              MR. WALKER: It usually doesn't work the

20         other way.

21               THE COURT: Yeah. I was going to say,

22         visiting judges don't usually go from Fort Myers

23         to Minnesota in the middle of winter.

24              MR. BIGGER: They're running a little behind,

25         but they're going to need him Monday. And so, you 2864

1         know, obviously we're doing everything we can.

2         We're all apparently working hard, trying to get

3         the examination done in a timely and efficient

4         manner. But if we can't get this thing done with

5         the witness by Friday night, cross, redirect,

6         everything done, we're obviously going to need to

7         figure out what to do.

8              He's expected down there. I think he even

9         has family perhaps coming down over the weekend.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=195
10         He's going to testify Monday. If we have to bring

11          him back on Tuesday and resume his testimony,

12         wherever we are at that time, I guess that's what

13         we'll have to do. But he's got a federal subpoena

14         that he's got to honor at some point here.

15         Supposed to be there by tomorrow, but apparently

16         could be by Monday.

17              MR. WALKER: Judge, I very much doubt that

18         he's under a subpoena. He's a retained witness in

19         that litigation, just as he is here. And whether

20         or not he's --

21               THE COURT: Well, regardless of whether or

22         not he's being retained, he may be still under a

23         subpoena.

24              MR. BIGGER: And that's what I was told by

25         the plaintiffs attorney. 2865

1              THE COURT: What I need to do is -- well,

2         I'll let you finish, Mr. Walker.

3              MR. WALKER: I don't think he is. I think if

4         there's an issue with his testimony in the federal

5         trial, that's something that can be dealt with in

6         the federal trial. He's on the stand here. If

7         what Mr. Bigger is suggesting is that my

8         examination or Mr. Pedrosa's examination be

9         interrupted so he can go testify someplace else, I

10         object to that. I don't think that's appropriate.

11               THE COURT: All right. I need the telephone

12         number of the judge in -- what city?

13              MR. BIGGER: It's in Fort Myers, in federal

14         court down there.

15              THE COURT: The federal judge in Fort Myers.

16         And if need be, I'll contact him or her, and we'll

17         go from there.

18              MR. BIGGER: I believe it is a him. But I'll

19         get the name and the number for Your Honor.

20              THE COURT: Okay.

21               MR. PEDROSA: Just for the record, I would

22         join in that objection as well as any -- you know,

23         trying to parse Dr. Cummings in between the direct

24         and a cross or one cross and the other cross would

25         be hugely prejudicial to us. 2866

1              THE COURT: Okay.

2              MR. UITERWYK: I don't like that it gives you

3         maybe two days, three days to get ready for him.

4              MR. PEDROSA: I would rather -

5              THE COURT: Okay. Let's move along.

6              MR. BIGGER: Let me get the witness back.

7              THE BAILIFF: All rise.

8              (Jury in at 3:09 p.m.)

9              THE COURT: Thank you. Be seated. We're

10         ready to proceed.

11               Mr. Uiterwyk.

12     BY MR. UITERWYK:

13         Q.   Yeah. I believe that we were talking about

14     filtered cigarettes and the different levels of tar and

15     nicotine versus what the real world was. And what I

16     want to do, Doctor, is refer the jury to one of the

17     documents.

18              Are you familiar with the Brown & Williamson

19     memo -- Brown & Williamson being owned by RJR -- titled

20     "Industry Response to Cigarette Health Controversy" --

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.    by Mr. Pepples done in February of 1976?

23         A.   Correct.

24         Q.   I would like to -- and who is Mr. Pepples?

25         A.   I'm sorry. I call him Mr. Pepples. He was 2867

1      chief general counsel for Brown & Williamson. He also

2     served on their executive committee to various

3     affiliate organizations like the Tobacco Institute.

4              THE COURT: What tab number, sir?

5              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, that's tab 69.

6              THE COURT: Okay. Let me get to it, please.

7              Okay.

8              MR. UITERWYK: I would like to introduce into

9         evidence, with the witness's testimony, PT 2023.

10              MR. WALKER: No additional objection,

11          Your Honor.

12              THE COURT: Okay. It will be received in

13         evidence.

14              (Exhibit No. PT 2023 received.)

15     BY MR. UITERWYK:

16         Q.   Briefly, Doctor, what's this document about?

17         A.   This document is, you know, essentially

18     assessing how the industry has responded to the

19     cigarette health controversy up until the mid 1970s

20     when this document is produced, and then mentioning

21      that filters and low tar had been one of the responses.

22         Q.   And particularly what I want to do there,

23     Doctor, is -- it says here, first of all, "The industry

24     has moved strongly toward filter cigarettes, which have

25     increased from 6 percent to 87 percent during the time 2868

1     frame of 25 years. This became known as the tar

2     derby."

3              What do they mean by the tar derby, briefly?

4              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, meaning

5         and intent.

6              THE COURT: All right. Lay more of a

7         predicate, please.

8              MR. UITERWYK: All right.

9     BY MR. UITERWYK:

10         Q.   Are you familiar that the term "tar derby"

11      was being used during the 1950s and thereafter?

12         A.   Yes.

13         Q.   Was it being used in companies' documents as

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=197
14     well as otherwise?

15         A.   Yes.

16         Q.   And when they referred to the tar derby --

17     and did you -- have you seen this in connection with

18     your study, research, and so forth?

19         A.   Yes.

20         Q.   And when they use the term "tar derby," what

21      derby were they referring to?

22         A.   Basically a competition among the companies

23     in their marketing to -- that they promoted that they

24     had the lowest tar and nicotine cigarette on the

25     market. This happened with the introduction of filters 2869

1     in a lot of the marketing that was going on at that

2     time, and they refer to this period of time from the

3     mid '50s through the end of the 1950s as the tar derby

4     period.

5         Q.   And here they -- he concludes, "In most

6     cases, however" -- the last sentence -- or last two

7     sentences, "In most cases, however, the smoker of a

8     filtered cigarette was getting as much or more nicotine

9     and tar as he would have gotten from a regular

10     cigarette. He had abandoned the regular cigarette,

11      however, on the grounds of reduced risk of health."

12              Doctor, did your research show that this was,

13     in fact, true?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   So did the cigarette companies know this,

16     that, in fact, they were getting more tar and nicotine

17     in a filtered cigarette than they were in the regular

18     cigarettes?

19         A.   They did.

20         Q.   Did they ever tell the American smoker, their

21      customers, about this?

22         A.   No.

23         Q.   Did they ever warn their customers about

24     this?

25              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, asked and 2870

1          answered, argumentative.

2              THE COURT: Overruled.

3              THE WITNESS: Not that I'm aware, no.

4     BY MR. UITERWYK:

5         Q.   All right. And do filters reduce the risk of

6     getting cigarette-related diseases?

7              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, design

8         testimony.

9              THE COURT: Sir?

10              MR. WALKER: It's scientific design

11          testimony, Judge.

12              THE COURT: Overruled.

13              THE WITNESS: They do not.

14     BY MR. UITERWYK:

15         Q.   Do they reduce the risk of becoming addicted?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=198
16              MR. WALKER: Same objection.

17              THE COURT: Overruled.

18              THE WITNESS: The addition of filters

19         increased the risk of addiction because of deeper

20         inhalation, smaller particles into the lungs.

21      BY MR. UITERWYK:

22         Q.   And I think we referred to it in the --on

23     the board that we were looking at earlier, the illusion

24     of filtration, correct?

25         A.   Yes. 2871

1          Q.   Now, are you familiar with a document called

2     the "Market Potential of a Health Cigarette, Special

3     Report" by Johnston to Dunn, Wakeham, and Seligman?

4         A.   I am.

5              MR. UITERWYK: All right. For the record,

6         that's PT 3678 dated -

7     BY MR. UITERWYK:

8         Q.   The document is dated 6/1/1966?

9         A.   Correct.

10              MR. UITERWYK: All right. Your Honor, I

11          would like to offer and introduce into evidence

12         document number PT 3678.

13              THE COURT: Which tab is that, sir?

14              MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry. Seventy,

15         Your Honor. I'll remember to try to do that every

16         time.

17              THE COURT: I don't have my notes on this.

18         Was this one that I required more of a predicate?

19              MR. UITERWYK: No, Your Honor.

20              MR. WALKER: I don't believe so, Your Honor.

21          As redacted, we have no additional objections.

22              THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. It will be

23         received.

24              (Exhibit No. PT 3678 received.)

25     BY MR. UITERWYK: 2872

1          Q.   All right. First of all, again, is this --

2     what company is this?

3         A.   Philip Morris.

4         Q.   And was Philip Morris involved with these

5     defendants in industry organizations that we will talk

6     about later, like Tobacco Institute Research Council?

7         A.   Yes, they were.

8         Q.   Which were later known as CTR?

9         A.   CTR and Tobacco Industry Research Committee

10     were, you know, created by the defendants as well as

11      Philip Morris and other company executives in the early

12     '50s. And then they also created the Tobacco Institute

13     and jointly funded those organizations.

14         Q.   And we'll talk about more on that later.

15              But why did you select -- first of all, this

16     was 19 what? Why did you select this document?

17         A.   Well, it's a market survey of the American

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=199
18     public and -- a large study that was done by Philip

19     Morris, Myron Johnston to Bill Dunn. Bill Dunn ran the

20     human psychology program at Philip Morris. And they

21      were talking about the opportunity that existed for the

22     companies to design and market cigarettes to those who

23     were health concerned and also to women. Those were

24     the two targets that are talked about here.

25         Q.   And did they also discuss in here the 2873

1     marketing of what they called a "health cigarette"?

2         A.   Yes.

3         Q.   Did they, in fact, on the bottom say, "Women,

4     particularly young women, would constitute the greatest

5     market -- potential market for a health cigarette"?

6         A.   Correct.

7         Q.   And then they also talk about that "The

8     Surgeon General's report had markedly less effect on

9     the demand for health cigarettes than the first health

10     scare in the 1960s. Any future health scares will

11     probably have even less effect."

12         A.   The first health scare was the 1950s, not the

13      1960s.

14         Q.   Right. All right. I'm sorry. I read 1960.

15     Sorry, Doctor.

16              And did, in fact, the defendants market their

17     cigarettes as health cigarettes?

18         A.   Certain brands were definitely marketed as

19     high filtration cigarettes. And, yes, they did.

20         Q.   Did Lorillard market their Kent filter

21      cigarettes early on as a healthy cigarette?

22         A.   Yes.

23         Q.   Particularly a light cigarette as a safer

24     cigarette?

25         A.   Yes, they did. 2874

1          Q.   And did Jackie Loyd at some time during the

2     '80s actually switch to Kent --

3         A.   Yes.

4         Q.    which would -- which was marketed as a

5     health cigarette.

6         A.   She switched to Kent. And there's also

7     testimony she smoked Kent III and later True.

8         Q.   Did the cigarette companies ever tell anyone

9     or disclose to anyone that their light cigarettes that

10     were marketed as health cigarettes were, in fact, not

11      light cigarettes and were not health cigarettes?

12         A.   No.

13         Q.   Did they ever warn anybody that what they

14     were marketing as a light cigarette or health cigarette

15     was inaccurate?

16              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, preemption.

17              THE COURT: Overruled.

18              THE WITNESS: When?

19     BY MR. UITERWYK:

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=200
20         Q.   Prior to 1991.

21          A.   No, not to consumers. Certainly there was --

22     there is correspondence to the government about the FTC

23     smoking machine and the standard method that came out

24     but not to consumers.

25         Q.   Do they use the term "light" anymore? 2875

1         A.   No.

2         Q.   Are they allowed to?

3              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

4              THE COURT: Sustained.

5     BY MR. UITERWYK:

6         Q.   All right. All the things that we were

7     talking in that list before, the blending, the

8     marketing, the manipulations, the design, additives,

9     controlling level of nicotine, the burn rate,

10     controlling the ventilation, in your opinion --1 think

11      you've already testified that this causes sustained

12     addiction. Did it also remove or diminish choice as it

13     relates to their customers?

14         A.   Yes. By maintaining the addiction, they take

15     away the choice.

16         Q.   All right. If they hadn't engineered and

17     manipulated the cigarettes like we discussed, in your

18     opinion, left it alone in tobacco and paper, would we

19     have 440,000 people a year die from their product?

20              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor,

21          argumentative.

22              THE COURT: Sustained.

23              MR. PEDROSA: And repetitive.

24              THE COURT: Sustained.

25     BY MR. UITERWYK: 2876

1          Q.   Now, let's talk about some documents as it

2     relates to cigarette design. And are we going to see

3     all the documents that discuss cigarette design, filter

4     design, manipulation of the cigarettes, or are we just

5     going to see the tip of the iceberg?

6              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, argumentative.

7              THE COURT: Sustained.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   Are we going to see a representative sample?

10         A.   Yes.

11          Q.   Are we going to see all the documents?

12         A.   No.

13         Q.   All right. And the first one is 2114, an RJR

14     document called "Memo Re: Materials Presented to the

15     R&D Management on July 13th, 1979." It's identified as

16     PT2114.

17              Are you familiar with that document?

18         A.   I am.

19              MR. UITERWYK: I'm going to offer and

20         introduce into evidence, Your Honor, PT 2114. And

21          that's tab No. 71, Your Honor. And that's, I

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=201
22         believe, already been admitted.

23              MR. WALKER: No additional objection.

24              THE COURT: All right. It will be received.

25              (Exhibit No. PT 2114 received.) 2877

1              MR. UITERWYK: Can we see it up there,

2         please?

3     BY MR. UITERWYK:

4         Q.   Again, is this a document marked "Secret"?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And the subject of that document is what?

7         A.   They're doing consumer testing, nicotine

8     satisfaction.

9         Q.   To whom was this paper addressed?

10         A.   Well, it's addressed to Calvin Neumann, who

11      was basically involved in their cigarette technology

12     unit at Reynolds, and to Mr. Wallace, who was in the

13     marketing department at R.J. Reynolds. And it's

14     written by Dr. Piehl, who was the manager of the

15     chemistry unit at R.J. Reynolds.

16         Q.   All right. And was this presented to the

17     research and development management in 1979?

18         A.   Yes. It was routed. You can see "GP." So

19     that's part of the Project GP.

20         Q.   All right. That we discussed earlier?

21          A.   That's right.

22              MR. UITERWYK: All right. If we can go to

23         Bates stamp 3, please.

24     BY MR. UITERWYK:

25         Q.   Now, what was the object of this research? 2878

1         A.   Well, they were doing consumer market

2     studies, and they were varying aspects of cigarette

3     design to determine the minimum/optimum nicotine

4     delivery that maximizes consumer acceptance among

5     full-flavor Winston King Size smokers -- excuse me --

6     Winston king size smoker. Sorry.

7         Q.   What is a full-flavor smoker?

8         A.   Well, a full-flavor is somebody who's smoking

9     a regular cigarette in contrast to one that is marketed

10     as lower in tar and nicotine.

11          Q.   And when they--references are made to

12     optimum or minimum/optimum nicotine delivery, what is

13     that in layman terms?

14              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor,

15         meaning --

16              THE COURT: Lay a predicate, please.

17     BY MR. UITERWYK:

18         Q.   All right. Are you familiar in the industry

19     with the term "minimum/optimum nicotine delivery"?

20         A.   Yes.

21          Q.   Is that a term frequently used within the

22     industry?

23         A.   They were interested in both.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=202
24              THE COURT: No. "Yes" or "no."

25              THE WITNESS: Yes. 2879

1     BY MR. UITERWYK:

2         Q.   And is that something that you've researched

3     and studied on -- and studied and written on with -- on

4     issues that involve minimum/optimum nicotine delivery?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   All right. And can you explain to the jury

7     what the term "minimum/optimum nicotine delivery" is

8     meant based on your research?

9         A.   Sure. They were doing consumer satisfaction

10     studies. So basically how consumers were responding to

11      different cigarettes that were manipulated in certain

12     ways. And there were two things they were looking at.

13     One is the minimum amount of nicotine below which the

14     threshold of consumer satisfaction would fall.

15              And then secondly, they were interested in

16     the optimum amount of nicotine where they get the

17     highest ratings in terms of the products that they were

18     testing in this particular experiment that involved

19     Winston King Size smokers.

20         Q.   And in your opinion, Doctor, based on your

21      review of this document as well as your experience

22     within the -- on the issue of industry documents, why

23     were they -- what was the purpose in looking at the

24     optimum nicotine delivery?

25         A.   Well, they wanted to sell more cigarettes. 2880

1          Q.   What effect does the high optimum nicotine

2     delivery have on the cigarette?

3         A.   Well, if you had the right dosage in an

4     acceptable form for the smoker that was rated as --

5     highly in terms of giving smoker satisfaction, then

6     they felt they had a product that they would sell more

7     of. And if they went below a minimum level of nicotine

8     below which they were concerned about consumer

9     satisfaction dropping and that affecting their sales.

10              So they didn't want to go too low, and they

11      wanted to basically hit the sweet spot, which they're

12     defining as the optimum amount.

13              MR. UITERWYK: All right. Now, let's go to

14         page 5, please.

15     BY MR. UITERWYK:

16         Q.   What did they -- let me go ahead and read

17     that, Doctor.

18               "Overall satisfaction. Appendix 3B showed

19     the overall satisfaction response for all respondents.

20     The respondents indicated the maximum satisfaction with

21      respect to nicotine at 1.0 milligrams per cigarette."

22              Did I read that right?

23         A.   Correct.

24         Q.   And is this -- based on your review of all

25     the industry documents, is this what they -- the level,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=203
2881

1      about -- around the level of 1.0 milligrams per

2     cigarette about the level that they manipulated their

3     cigarettes to provide being the sweet spot or the

4     optimum minimum level?

5              MR. WALKER: Objection, leading.

6              THE COURT: Overruled.

7              THE WITNESS: Yeah. It's about that level.

8         This was for, you know, a group of full-flavored

9         Winston King Size smokers. And the optimum level

10         turned out to be about 1 milligram of nicotine in

11          the smoke. And then they also talk about looking

12         at the ratio of tar to nicotine because that was

13         another variable that they examined, as well as a

14         whole variety of other things in this study.

15     BY MR. UITERWYK:

16         Q.   Let's go to another document on the subject

17     of manipulation.

18              Exhibit No. 2114 -- sorry, that's the wrong

19     one. Exhibit No. 1835, a letter from Lawrence --

20     Laurene to Senkus on "Possible IBT Project dated 1971."

21      Are you familiar with that document?

22         A.   Yes. It's Tab 72.

23         Q.   Tab 72.

24              MR. UITERWYK: And I'm going to offer it into

25         evidence, Your Honor, Exhibit No. 1835 -- PT 1835. 2882

1              MR. WALKER: As redacted, no additional

2         objections.

3              THE COURT: It will be received.

4              (Exhibit No. 1835 received.)

5     BY MR. UITERWYK:

6         Q.   First of all, why did you select this

7     document as it relates to manipulation design,

8     manipulation, and engineering that was done by the

9     companies?

10         A.   These are two high-level scientists at R.J.

11      Reynolds. And they're talking about, again, a project

12     in the early 1970s, that is specifically looking at

13     identifying the minimum amount of nicotine below which

14     they didn't want to go and how to control the delivery

15     of nicotine to smokers. So in 1971, they're outlying

16     their research agenda for this particular series of

17     studies that were undertaken at Reynolds.

18         Q.   Is this from the Reynolds Corporation?

19         A.   Yes.

20         Q.   Absorption of nicotine in the mouth versus

21      the lungs, did they study that?

22         A.   They did.

23         Q.   Did they also study pH in the mouth in

24     response to Turkish smoke, burley smoke, and various

25     components? 2883

1         A.   Yes. They were looking at the chemo sensory

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=204
2     effects in the mouth. It's a fancy way of seeing how

3     somebody might respond and the absorption of nicotine

4     in the mouth. Because some of the factors like pH can

5     affect differentially the absorption and mouth feel of

6     the cigarette which affects somebody's perception of

7     the product.

8         Q.   And, Dr. Cummings, did they also study the

9     difference of nicotine impact from free nicotine and

10     bound nicotine, semi-colon, effect of pH of smoke?

11          A.   Yes.

12         Q.   And habituating level of nicotine; how low

13     can we go?

14         A.   Correct.

15         Q.   Now, was RJR the only company that was

16     studying these types of things and researching the

17     manipulation and what they were doing and the design

18     and engineering to get the -- to cause the sustained

19     addiction?

20         A.   No, they weren't.

21          Q.   Are you familiar with some project done --

22              MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, may we approach at

23         this point? These are the exhibits that we

24         mentioned earlier.

25              MR. UITERWYK: Forgot. 2884

1              THE COURT: Please.

2              (At sidebar.)

3              THE COURT: These are documents that were

4         skipped?

5              MR. PEDROSA: Yes.

6              MR. UITERWYK: We discussed this document.

7              Tab 174.

8              MR. PEDROSA: Yeah, it's PT 1230.

9              MR. UITERWYK: I thought we discussed that if

10         we redacted any reference to pneumonia that it was

11          going to go in.

12              MR. PEDROSA: Right. Have you redacted it?

13              MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

14              MR. PEDROSA: I didn't realize you had

15         redacted it.

16              MR. UITERWYK: Yes. That's why--1 wouldn't

17         be offering it if I hadn't --1 can check with

18         Baron again.

19              MR. PEDROSA: This is not one we discussed

20         with pneumonia. This one falls under the program

21          where I argued the motion in limine. It was an

22         experimental program at Lorillard called the

23          "Nicotine Augmentation Program." You denied my

24         motion in limine without prejudice.

25              I would renew those objections, but I can see 2885

1         that based on your rulings you would overrule

2         those objections. However, at the end of the

3         hearing, I said, Judge, without a minimum, the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=205
4         title of the document, the title of the program is

5         hugely prejudicial.

6              And I would ask that he -- that the plaintiff

7         be barred from using the title of the document.

8         And you agreed that in opening -- or he agreed

9         that in opening he wouldn't mention it and that

10         before using any of the documents he would

11          approach.

12              So that's where we are. We've approached.

13         And I would ask that just the title of the

14         document -- obviously without waiving any of my

15         other objections, which have been overruled, I

16         would ask the title of the document and the title

17         which appears on the last page and the conclusion

18         just be redacted to "Program."

19              MR. UITERWYK: I don't know why we -- it says

20         nicotine augmentation -- it has, actually, Project

21          Goal. That's a title. Why are we changing a

22         document to -- there's no reason to change the

23         document.

24              MR. PEDROSA: I argued previously that the

25         prejudice or much of the prejudice is in the 2886

1         title. They can talk about -- you'll allow them

2         to talk about the substance of it, but adding the

3         name of it does nothing but inflame the prejudice.

4         It doesn't add anything to the relevance of the

5         document itself or to its probative value in any

6         way. It merely adds prejudice. And that

7         prejudice is substantial.

8              THE COURT: I'll overrule the objection.

9         Have you redacted the names here?

10              MR. PEDROSA: No.

11               THE COURT: Have these names been redacted?

12              MR. UITERWYK: That was not discussed.

13              THE COURT: Okay. I thought you said it was.

14              MR. PEDROSA: We hadn't gotten to this

15         document in terms of arguing the objections.

16              THE COURT: There was some discussion at

17         sidebar just a minute ago that it has been

18         redacted.

19              MR. UITERWYK: He's talking about we redacted

20         issues regarding --

21               THE COURT: Okay. You have the same

22         objections to what, the next one?

23              MR. PEDROSA: I would have all the same

24         objections.

25              THE COURT: Likewise. 2887

1              MR. PEDROSA: It would be the same argument,

2         yes. I would ask that the copy -- that because

3         the markings cannot be authenticated, I would just

4         ask that the copy that actually goes into

5         evidence, that all the handwriting be redacted.

6              MR. UITERWYK: I don't have a problem with

7         that.

8              THE COURT: Okay.

9              MR. PEDROSA: Thank you, Your Honor.

10              (Sidebar concluded.)

11               MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, he's going to make

12         some -- then I'm going to come back to it.

13              THE COURT: Okay.

14     BY MR. UITERWYK:

15         Q.   Let's go back, if we can now, where we're

16     making some adjustments here.

17              Are you -- before we go back to there, are

18     you familiar with a document PT identification --

19     Exhibit No. PT 3540, dated June 8th, 1976, Application

20     of Free Nicotine to Cigarette Tobacco and the Delivery

21      of That Nicotine in Cigarette Smoke.

22              MR. UITERWYK: It's Tab No. 74, Your Honor.

23              THE WITNESS: I have it.

24     BY MR. UITERWYK:

25         Q.   And whose document is that? 2888

1         A.   It's a Lorillard document.

2         Q.   And on Bates page 4 -- now, Lorillard is the

3     manufacturer of Kent, Kent III and True, correct?

4         A.   Correct.

5         Q.   And on page 4, under Comments, what do they

6     conclude?

7              MR. PHILLIPSON: Is it in evidence?

8              MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry. It is in evidence,

9         Your Honor.

10              MR. PHILLIPSON:  1835.

11               MR. UITERWYK: PT 3540.

12     BY MR. UITERWYK:

13         Q.   Is that the document we were discussing?

14         A.   Yes.

15              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I would like to

16         introduce into evidence PT 3540.

17              THE COURT: All right. So subject to your -

18         well, I'm overruling your objections, and it will

19         be received in evidence.

20              (Exhibit No. PT 3540 received.)

21               MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I don't know if I

22         offered 3678, but we did that a little while ago

23         and I just want to make sure that I got them. And

24         2023. Have they been offered?

25              THE CLERK: Yes. 2889

1     BY MR. UITERWYK:

2         Q.   Let's go back to 3540, if we could, please.

3              And under Comments, what do they conclude

4     starting with, "This is indicated" ?

5              MR. PHILLIPSON: Bates page 4?

6              MR. UITERWYK: Page 4.

7     BY MR. UITERWYK:

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=207
8         Q.   All right. Under Summary. Let's go to the

9     last line. What -- can you -- "It appeared that adding

10     free nicotine, even when delivered at low levels,

11     provided the impact of a high delivery cigarette."

12              Are you familiar with the term "high delivery

13     cigarette"?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   Is that an industry term?

16         A.   Yes.

17         Q.   And what is a high delivery cigarette?

18              MR. WALKER: Objection, meaning and intent.

19              THE COURT: Overruled.

20              THE WITNESS: It's the same as a

21          full-flavored cigarette. It was the class of

22         cigarettes that were marketed as full flavor or

23         regular cigarettes versus those that were marketed

24         as lower yield products.

25     BY MR. UITERWYK: 2890

1          Q.   And have you researched the issue of changing

2     the pH as it relates to free nicotine and affecting the

3     impact of the high delivery cigarette?

4              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, Your Honor, your

5         ruling on additives.

6              THE COURT: Overruled.

7     BY MR. UITERWYK:

8         Q.   Go ahead.

9         A.   Yes.

10         Q.   And based on your research, was pH adjusted

11      to affect the impact of the high delivery cigarette?

12         A.   Yes, as well as the low delivery ones.

13         Q.   Okay. In addition to Lorillard, did other --

14     did RJR discuss the increase of pH to increase the free

15     nicotine and get a better kick?

16         A.   Yes.

17              MR. UITERWYK: And we want to look at PT

18         3291, Tab 75, Your Honor.

19              Baron, let me know when you're ready. We may

20         have to come back on that one later.

21               3291, Your Honor, I would like to introduce

22         into evidence, which is an RJR memo by Claude

23         Teague, dated August 14th, 1973.

24              MR. WALKER: No additional objections.

25              THE COURT: All right. It will be received. 2891

1               (Exhibit No. 3291 received.)

2     BY MR. UITERWYK:

3         Q.   All right. Now, this was also marked as

4     "secret"?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   The title of this document, "Implications and

7     activities arising from correlation of smoke pH with

8     nicotine impact, other smoke qualities, and cigarette

9     sales."

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=208
10              In this document, is he examining the smoke

11     pH, how it affects nicotine, nicotine impact, and other

12     smoke qualities and the sale of their cigarettes?

13              MR. WALKER: Objection, the document speaks

14         for itself.

15              THE COURT: Lay a predicate, please.

16              MR. UITERWYK: Let me just go ahead. Goto

17         the document.

18              Let's look at Bates 4, please, starting In

19         Essence. Where did you start?

20              MR. PHILLIPSON: On page 3, sir.

21               MR. UITERWYK: Hold on.

22     BY MR. UITERWYK:

23         Q.   Before we get to page 4, they provide in

24     there, "All evidence indicates that the relatively high

25     smoke pH, high alkalinity, shown by Marlboro and other 2892

1     Philip Morris brands, and Kool, is deliberate and

2     controlled."

3              Did your research show that some of the

4     brands actually did a high smoke pH deliberately?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And-

7              MR. UITERWYK: Can we go to the next page,

8         please? First paragraph.

9     BY MR. UITERWYK:

10         Q.   "In essence, the cigarette is a system for

11      delivery of nicotine to the smoker in an attractive,

12     useful form. At normal smoke pH, at or below 6.0,

13     essentially all of the smoke nicotine is chemically

14     combined with acidic substances, hence is non-volatile

15     and relatively slowly absorbed by the smoker."

16              Can you explain that in layman's terms?

17         A.   Yeah. The nicotine is in bound form and,

18     basically, is relatively slowly absorbed in the mouth.

19     So that's what it's talking about. So relatively

20     slower absorption of nicotine.

21          Q.   All right. And did they, in fact, adjust the

22     pH, increase it, in order to get a bigger kick?

23         A.   Yes, they did. If you alter through either

24     blending or use of additives, the pH level of the smoke

25     slightly above 6, as many of the different companies 2893

1      did, they found that the form of the nicotine went to

2     what they refer to as "bound" or "free" nicotine and

3     would facilitate more rapid absorption into the

4     bloodstream through the lining of the mouth and also

5     affect the feel of the smoke in the mouth so it was

6     less irritating and easier to inhale.

7         Q.   And did that cause sustained addiction?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   Did they conclude "As the smoke pH increases

10     above 6.0, an increasing proportion of the total smoke

11      nicotine occurs in free form which is volatile, rapidly

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=209
12     absorbed by the smoker and believed to be instantly

13     perceived as a nicotine kick"? Doctor?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   Did I read that right?

16         A.   You did.

17         Q.   And did he refer, then, to the chart and

18     compare the sales data as it relates to nicotine pH and

19     so -- did they?

20         A.   They did. They looked at the sales of both

21      their brands in terms of smoke pH as well as the brands

22     of their competitors to see how it linked. Because

23     certain brands were growing more rapidly at that time,

24     particularly Marlboro and Kool. And they

25     back-engineered their competitors' products to 2894

1      determine that a pH manipulation was likely the cause

2     of the people, you know, using those brands more than

3     the other brands.

4              MR. UITERWYK: And if we could look at PT 20,

5         please.

6              MR. PHILLIPSON: Page 20?

7              MR. UITERWYK: PT 20, Bates stamped.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   And what did they conclude there?

10         A.   Said-

11          Q.   The correlation of pH and share of market

12     performance?

13         A.   They said, "The correlation of pH and share

14     of market performance holds, but only for those brands

15     having the same nicotine levels. In the analysis of

16     differences in performance between Winston and Marlboro

17     and between Salem and Kool, pH does correlate equally

18     as well with performance as does free nicotine. The

19     total nicotine in Winston and Marlboro and Salem and

20     Kool is almost equal."

21          Q.   Let's look at another RJR document, if we

22     could. 3569. And this is entitled -- an RJR report by

23     Woods -- "Historical Review of Smoke pH Data and Sales

24     Trends For Competitive Brand Filters." This is dated

25      1973, correct? 2895

1         A.   Correct.

2              MR. UITERWYK: I'm going to offer to

3         introduce into evidence, Your Honor, 3569.

4              THE COURT: Tab number?

5              MR. UITERWYK: Tab No. 76, Your Honor.

6              MR. WALKER: Seventy-six, Your Honor, that's

7         redacted and we have no additional objections.

8              THE COURT: It will be received.

9              (Exhibit No. 3569 received.)

10     BY MR. UITERWYK:

11          Q.   Can we look at that, please? First of all,

12     what's that document about?

13         A.   It's basically looking at a review of sales

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=210
14     figures in relationship to smoke pH data in filtered

15     cigarettes.

16         Q.   Again, like all these other RJR documents,

17     it's marked "Confidential." When did those documents

18     become available to people like you who studied this

19     subject?

20         A.   These documents largely became available in

21      around the 1999-2000 period.

22         Q.   And did you have any awareness of these

23     documents before that?

24              MR. WALKER: Objection, relevance.

25              THE COURT: Sustained. 2896

1     BY MR. UITERWYK:

2         Q.   All right. Now, did they conclude -- first

3     of all, who's Mr. Woods?

4         A.   He's in the marketing department at Reynolds.

5         Q.   To whom was he making this report?

6         A.   Excuse me. Mr. Woods was in the chemistry

7     department.

8              This is basically -- I'm not sure who it was

9     copied to.

10         Q.   Let's go on, Doctor. We can just move on.

11          A.   It's copied to Mr. Senkus and Dr. Teague, and

12     Alan Rodgman, in the chemistry department at Reynolds.

13     So they head up the division of chemistry at Reynolds.

14     So senior scientists.

15         Q.   Looking at the bottom of page 1, going on to

16     page 2, did they conclude the "Correlation studies of

17     smoke pH and sales trends between 1964 and 1972 were

18     made for each brand. For Winston, pH values were

19     determined on freezer-stored cigarettes manufactured

20     between '57 and '64, and a correlation study made over

21      the period from '57 to 72."

22              Now, They froze their cigarettes like you

23     did, correct?

24         A.   That's right. It's a standard method for

25     preserving them. 2897

1          Q.   "The results of these studies show that there

2     is a strong positive correlation between smoke pH and

3     sales trends over the years studied."

4              So, Doctor, does your research show that all

5     the companies were studying how the level of pH and

6     what level of pH should be kept at to affect a smoker

7     and affect their sales?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   All right.  "A high pH is strong due to a

10     high concentration of unbound or free nicotine in the

11      smoke. Calculations of the unbound nicotine in the

12     smoke of the brands studied were made and used as

13     relative measures of strength for the cigarettes.

14     Correlation of these values with sales trends were

15     made, and the results showed even stronger positive

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=211
16     correlations than were found for smoke pH sales trends

17     studies. The results of these studies suggested that

18     the strength of a cigarette, which may be controlled in

19     part by adjustment of smoke pH, is extremely important

20     to the successful performance of the cigarette."

21               Did I read that right?

22         A.   You did.

23         Q.   Let me go one more.

24              MR. PHILLIPSON: Do you want to go back to

25          1235 and 40? They're available. 2898

1              MR. UITERWYK: Sure. Let me go back there.

2     BY MR. UITERWYK:

3         Q.   Let's look at the Lorillard document, if we

4     could please, Doctor?

5         A.   Okay.

6              MR. UITERWYK: And the first document is

7         called, The Nicotine Augmentation Project 1230,

8         which I'm going to offer and introduce into

9         evidence, Your Honor.

10              THE COURT: The objections made at sidebar

11          overruled. It will be received.

12              (Exhibit No. 1230 received.)

13     BY MR. UITERWYK:

14         Q.   Can you tell the jury, generally, what this

15     document is about rather than us going through the

16     entire part?

17         A.   Well, this particular series of projects

18     went -- went over many years. It's outlining product

19     manipulations that will be done and tested, including

20     adding nonnatural nicotine to the product as a way of

21      altering how smokers might respond. And they were

22     going to evaluate that along with a variety of other

23     design features, including how to add the nicotine, not

24     only sprayed into the tobacco but also sprayed onto the

25     filter, for example. Some of the work that they did. 2899

1          Q.   Did they examine the different ways they

2     could add to the nicotine to affect the pH --

3         A.   Yes, they did.

4         Q.   -- in this document?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And let me go on. Let's go on to the next

7     document, which is 35 and 40.

8              MR. UITERWYK: And I'm going to offer into

9         evidence, Application of free nicotine to

10         cigarette tobacco and delivery of that nicotine in

11          cigarette smoke. I'm going to offer that into

12         evidence, Your Honor, at 35, 40.

13              MR. PEDROSA: Actually, I think you already

14         did.

15              MR. UITERWYK: It's already -- hold on.

16         When?

17              MR. WALKER: About 15 minutes ago.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=212
18              MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, he skipped 73, went

19         to 74, and now we're back to 73.

20              MR. UITERWYK: My mistake, Your Honor. He's

21          right. My mistake. Already offered. Bear with

22         me, Your Honor.

23              THE COURT: Okay.

24     BY MR. UITERWYK:

25         Q.   Have we looked at all the documents in 2900

1     relation to the study, research, manipulations

2     cigarette companies did in this field, in this area?

3         A.   No. Just a really tiny fraction of the

4     similar types, and they go back in time even into the

5     early '60s.

6         Q.   And has your research shown that they

7     implemented what they were studying?

8         A.   They did.

9         Q.   And did they -- did it affect their sales by

10     implementing what they studied?

11          A.   Yes.

12         Q.   All right.

13              MR. UITERWYK: Let's go to 1552, Tab 77, Your

14         Honor. Document --a letter from Griffiths of B&W

15         to Kirwan and British American Tobacco Company,

16         dated 1973.

17     BY MR. UITERWYK:

18         Q.   Are you familiar with this document?

19         A.   I am.

20              MR. UITERWYK: I'm going to offer and

21          introduce into evidence, Your Honor, that document

22         No. 1552.

23              THE COURT: All right. I've overruled the

24         objections at sidebar. It will be received.

25              (Exhibit No. 1552 received.) 2901

1     BY MR. UITERWYK:

2         Q.   All right. Are you familiar with this

3     document?

4         A.   Yes. Dr. Griffiths was the head of research

5     and development at Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.

6         Q.   And why did you want the jury to see this

7     document, Doctor?

8         A.   Well, in 1963, Dr. Griffiths was talking

9     about the importance of nicotine to sales of different

10     brands across different companies. He is acknowledging

11      that "Nicotine is by far the most characteristic single

12     constituent in tobacco, and the known physiological

13     effects are positively correlated with smoker

14     response." And then they talk about that the nicotine

15     levels --

16         Q.   Hold on before we get to that -- go ahead

17     with that one. Go ahead.

18         A.   He says that the nicotine levels in the

19     product are not obtained by accident. He said,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=213
20     "Certainly the nicotine levels of Brown & Williamson

21      cigarettes given in the above table was not obtained by

22     accident. It may be well to remind you, however, that

23     we have a research program in progress to obtain, by

24     genetic means, any level of nicotine desired."

25         Q.   Go on to the next page, please. 2902

1              MR. PHILLIPSON: I believe that's the last

2         page.

3              MR. UITERWYK: You just did?

4              MR. PHILLIPSON: Yeah.

5              MR. UITERWYK: I'm behind you. All right.

6     BY MR. UITERWYK:

7         Q.   One last document in this area, if we could,

8     please, Dr. Cummings. And that is 3389.

9              MR. UITERWYK: Tab 72, Your Honor.

10     BY MR. UITERWYK:

11          Q.   It's called, "Enhancement of Nicotine Binding

12     to Nicotinic Receptors By Nicotine Levulinate and

13     Levulinic Acid." Did I read that right?

14         A.   You did.

15         Q.   Are you familiar with this document, an RJR

16     document?

17         A.   I am.

18         Q.   Dated 9/25/1989?

19         A.   Correct.

20              MR. UITERWYK: PT No. 3389. Your Honor, I

21          would like to offer and introduce into evidence PT

22         No. 3389.

23              THE COURT: What tab was that, Mr. Uiterwyk?

24              MR. UITERWYK: Seventy-eight, Your Honor.

25              THE COURT: Any additional objections? 2903

1              MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor.

2              THE COURT: It will be received.

3              (Exhibit No. 3389 received.)

4     BY MR. UITERWYK:

5         Q.   Are you familiar with the terms "nicotine

6     levulinate" and "levulinic acid" ?

7         A.   I wasn't until these documents became

8     available on the public website. These are additives

9     that were tested by R.J. Reynolds to enhance nicotine

10     binding in the brand.

11          Q.   And when you say to "enhance nicotine binding

12     in the brand," let's look at this first, the objective

13     of this study, and then look at the summary.

14              The objective was "To characterize the

15     effects of nicotine levulinate and levulinic acid on

16     the binding of L3H nicotine to nicotinic receptors in

17     membrane preparations derived from rat brain tissue and

18     to develop a plausible model that accounts for the

19     observed effects."

20              Now, is this what we were discussing, I

21     believe, yesterday with regard to nicotine receptors?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=214
22         A.   That's right.

23         Q.   And when they were talking about the effects

24     of this nicotine levulinate and levulinic acid, they

25     were talking about getting it to attach better to the 2904

1     nicotine receptors?

2              MR. WALKER: Objection, leading.

3              THE COURT: Sustained.

4     BY MR. UITERWYK:

5         Q.   What were they talking about in this regard,

6     Dr. Cummings?

7         A.   They were talking about testing an additive

8     that would affect the receptor binding of nicotine in

9     the brain so it would have its effect in the brain of

10     the -- in these cases, these rats. It's a very

11      sophisticated research of nicotine self-administration

12     and manipulating this to see how it would affect the

13     brain of animals.

14         Q.   Are you aware of any patents in this area?

15         A.   Yes.

16         Q.   What patents are you aware and by whom?

17         A.   Well, Reynolds has patents for this

18     particular work. And I have a collection of about

19     2,000 patents on cigarette design on all kinds of

20     topics.

21          Q.   And do they have a patent on this particular

22     work?

23         A.   Yes, they do.

24         Q.   And does the summary provide "Nicotine

25     levulinate and levulinic acid significantly increase 2905

1     the amount of L nicotine found in nicotine receptors in

2     rat brain tissue"?

3         A.   That's right.

4         Q.   What does that mean as it relates to what

5     effects it would have on a brain and the effect of

6     nicotine on the brain?

7         A.   Well, they're basically testing to see

8     whether it would enhance nicotine binding, and

9     potentially that could increase the addictiveness of

10     the product.

11          Q.   Have you brought some evidence that maybe we

12     haven't seen all the documents, that there were some

13     documents potentially destroyed?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   And I want to first look at PT 2181 --not

16     first.

17              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor-

18     BY MR. UITERWYK:

19         Q.   What -- are you familiar with the memo from

20     Senkus and Crohn, Invalidation of Some Reports in the

21      Research Department?

22         A.   Correct. 1969 Murray Senkus, who was vice

23     president for research, to Max Crohn, who was in the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=215
24     legal department at RJ. Reynolds.

25         Q.   And when this document was written, was this 2906

1      an RJR document?

2         A.   Yes.

3         Q.   And Mr. Senkus was with RJR?

4         A.   Yeah. He was one of their senior people in

5     research and development, a long-time employee from the

6     '50s.

7         Q.   And this was in December of 1969?

8         A.   Correct.

9              MR. UITERWYK: And, Your Honor, I would like

10         to offer and introduce in as evidence PT 2181.

11               THE COURT: What tab, sir?

12              MR. UITERWYK: Tab 79, Your Honor.

13              THE COURT: Any additional objections?

14              MR. WALKER: Just inadequate predicate,

15         Your Honor.

16              THE COURT: All right. Sustained at this

17         point.

18     BY MR. UITERWYK:

19         Q.   Are you familiar with this document?

20         A.   lam.

21          Q.   Did you actually locate this document?

22         A.   Yes.

23         Q.   And did you -- were you aware that it was a

24     document produced by RJR?

25         A.   Yes. 2907

1          Q.   Did you obtain it from the records from RJR?

2         A.   It came off their website, yes.

3              MR. WALKER: Objection, relevance.

4              THE COURT: Overruled.

5     BY MR. UITERWYK:

6         Q.   And are you familiar with the people who

7     signed this document, the date that it was prepared,

8     and to whom it was addressed?

9         A.   Yes.

10         Q.   And what is on this document, is it an

11      accurate reflection of that in that regard?

12         A.   Yes.

13         Q.   And is this a true copy of what you had?

14         A.   Yes.

15              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I would like to

16         offer and introduce into evidence the document,

17         which is 2181.

18              THE COURT: Yeah, I'm looking at it.

19              Approach, please.

20              (At sidebar.)

21               MR. UITERWYK: I got it.

22              THE COURT: This is a one-page document? The

23         tab has more than one page.

24              MR. WALKER: Yes, it's a one-page document.

25              MR. UITERWYK: It's just a one-page document,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=216
2908

1         just a different copy, Your Honor.

2              THE COURT: Okay. Who is it from?

3              MR. UITERWYK: It's from Mr. Senkus from the

4         research department.

5              THE COURT: How do I know that?

6              MR. UITERWYK: I've got -- you're looking at

7         the wrong document, Your Honor.

8              THE COURT: Oh, I am?

9              MR. WALKER: That's the right document, 2181.

10              MR. UITERWYK: Well, it's 2181A. We're both

11          looking at two different documents. No wonder

12         we're having some confusion here.

13              MR. WALKER: This is the first time we've

14         been provided this document, Your Honor.

15              MR. UITERWYK: I thought it was part of the

16         documents we went over. I'm confused.

17              MR. WALKER: That's what was in your binder.

18              MR. UITERWYK: Then it's the wrong copy.

19              THE COURT: Okay. It appears it's the

20         same -- it appears it's the same document, but the

21          one in the binder is essentially a larger font or

22         copy, and the author's name was deleted. And that

23         clears up at least who it came from. That's why I

24         asked the question.

25              MR. UITERWYK: I was confused, Judge. 2909

1              THE COURT: Right. I understand.

2              MR. UITERWYK: I apologize for the confusion.

3              THE COURT: Apparently counsel had the same

4         confusion as to that --

5              MR. WALKER: It appears that the document we

6         were all looking at this morning was a draft.

7         Because the information in the middle, the

8         numbered paragraphs, are actually different.

9              THE COURT: Okay. In paragraph 4?

10              MR. WALKER: Paragraph 4 and some of the

11          others. The paragraphs 3 don't match. I don't

12         know what all the differences are.

13              THE COURT: All right. I'm going to allow

14         it.

15              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I don't know what

16         the question is going to be about this --

17              THE COURT: Okay.

18              MR. WALKER: --but I suspect it's going to

19         be a question that asks him to speculate about the

20         nature of the documents that for whatever reason

21          are not available.

22              MR. UITERWYK: I'm not asking that. I'm

23         going to ask him just to read one paragraph and

24         that's it.

25              THE COURT: Just publish it. 2910

1             MR. UITERWYK: That's all I'm going to do.

2              MR. WALKER: Thank you, Your Honor.

3              THE COURT: Okay.

4              (Sidebar concluded.)

5              MR. UITERWYK: For the record, the confusion

6         we created is we had two different copies of this

7         document, Your Honor. And, in fact, the document

8         we're going to be talking about is 2181 A.

9     BY MR. UITERWYK:

10         Q.   Looking at the first paragraph, Your Honor --

11      sorry -- Dr. Cummings -- I'm getting tired --

12              MR. UITERWYK: And this is received in

13         evidence, correct, Your Honor?

14              THE COURT: Yes.

15              (Exhibit No. 2181A received.)

16     BY MR. UITERWYK:

17         Q.   What did Mr. Senkus, Murray Senkus, say to

18     Mr. Max Crohn in 1969?

19         A.   Dr. Senkus said, "We do not foresee any

20     difficulty in the event a decision is reached to remove

21      certain reports from research files. Once it becomes

22     clear that such action is necessary for the successful

23     defense of our present and future suits, we will

24     promptly remove all such reports from our files."

25         Q.   And then did he also -- what did he state in 2911

1     the last three paragraphs?

2         A.   "As to the reports which you are recommending

3     to be invalidated, we can site misinterpretation of

4     data as reason for invalidation. A further reason is

5     that many of these are" --

6         Q.   "Unwarranted repetitions."

7         A.   Yeah -- "unwarranted repetitions and are

8     being removed to alleviate overcrowding of our files.

9     As an alternative to invalidation, we can have the

10     authors rewrite those sections of the report which

11      appear objectionable. We are awaiting a decision as to

12     the action to be taken with respect to the reports in

13     question."

14         Q.   Thank you, Doctor.

15              Now, the next document we're going to be

16     talking about is 2006 -- PT 2006, a memo from Dunn to

17     Osdean, a proposed study by Levy.

18              Are you familiar with that document dated --

19         A.   November 3rd, 1977.

20         Q.   Thank you.

21               MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, it's under tab No.

22         81.

23     BY MR. UITERWYK:

24         Q.   Who did this document, Your Honor -- sorry,

25     Dr. Cummings. Go ahead. 2912

1         A.   Yeah. This is Dr. Levy, who worked in

2     research and development at Philip Morris at the time.

3     And she's writing to Bill Dunn, who's the head of

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=218
4     the -- actually, the memo is regarding Levy's study.

5     It's Bill Dunn from -- who runs the human psychology

6     program at Philip Morris to his boss, Tom Osdean, who

7     was the head of R&D at Philip Morris at the time in

8      1997. They're talking about a nicotine study that

9     Dr. Levy -- Carol Levy -- is going to carry out to

10     evaluate whether people, when they abstain from

11      smoking, whether they experience withdrawal.

12              MR. UITERWYK: And I'm going to offer and

13         introduce into evidence, Your Honor, PT 2006.

14              THE COURT: All right. Any other objections?

15              MR. WALKER: No additional, Your Honor.

16              THE COURT: It will be received.

17              (Exhibit No. PT 2006 received.)

18              MR. UITERWYK: Can we put that up, please,

19         Baron?

20     BY MR. UITERWYK:

21          Q.   And did -- Mr. Dunn -- who's the head of the

22     human psychology department?

23         A.   Yeah. Dr. Dunn, yeah.

24         Q.   And what type of project -- what type of work

25     did Dr. Dunn do at Philip Morris? 2913

1         A.   He did research on human smoking behavior,

2     what's known as the nicotine kick.

3         Q.   And were representatives of Philip Morris

4     involved in the industry organizations with RJR and

5     Lorillard?

6         A.   Yes, they were.

7         Q.   And did he say at that time, "I have given

8     Carol an approval to proceed with this study. If she

9     is able to demonstrate, as she anticipates, no

10     withdrawal effects of nicotine, we will want to pursue

11      this avenue with some vigor. If, however, the results

12     with nicotine are similar to those gotten with morphine

13     and caffeine, we will want to bury it. Accordingly,

14     here are the only two copies of this memo, the one

15     attached and the original one I have."

16              Is that a document that you obtained in

17     connection with the disclosure of those documents in

18      1990?

19              MR. WALKER: Objection, relevance.

20              THE COURT: Overruled.

21               THE WITNESS: Yes.

22              MR. UITERWYK: All right. Your Honor, I'm

23         going to be switching subjects right now.

24              THE COURT: Okay.

25              MR. UITERWYK: Do you want me to -- do you 2914

1         want to take a break now or do you want to keep

2         going?

3              THE COURT: No, I would like to see if we can

4         continue --

5              MR. UITERWYK: That's fine.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=219
6              THE COURT: -- to five o'clock if we can.

7              MR. UITERWYK: That's fine.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   I'm going to switch, Dr. Cummings, to ads,

10     marketing that we've been talking about.

11          A.   Okay.

12         Q.   And before I do that, I want to show the jury

13     a photograph of Jackie Loyd at the age of 16. And I

14     want you to assume this has been identified as a

15     photograph of Jackie Loyd at age 16.

16              MR. UITERWYK: Please show that.

17     BY MR. UITERWYK:

18         Q.   Assuming this is Jackie Loyd at age 16, is

19     this when she began smoking?

20         A.   Based on the evidence that I've reviewed,

21      yes, she began smoking at the age of 16.

22         Q.   And smokers that were born in the '20s, what

23     percent of them -- and '30s like her, what percentage

24     of them were smoking around this time?

25         A.   The percentage of women taking up smoking at 2915

1     this time was increasing. Overall prevalence in the

2     early '50s was around about a quarter, one out of four

3     were smokers.

4              MR. UITERWYK: All right. And, Your Honor,

5         what we're going to do with the Court's

6         permission, we have an ad notebook that we're

7         going to hand out to the jury to save time. It

8         has tabs on it. If we may do that, please?

9              THE COURT: All right.

10              MR. UITERWYK: May the bailiff do that,

11         please?

12              THE COURT: Yeah. Give it to the bailiff to

13         publish.

14              MR. PHILLIPSON:  Switch it to the ELMO,

15         please.

16     BY MR. UITERWYK:

17         Q.   Doctor, are we going to be looking at some

18     advertising that was representative of the type of

19     advertising going on before Jackie Loyd started

20     smoking, while she was smoking, and thereafter?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   And we've got this notebook -- ad notebook

23     that we've handed out to the jury.

24              Do you have a copy of that, Doctor?

25         A.   I do. 2916

1              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I'm sorry. May we

2         approach?

3              THE COURT: Just keep your books closed for

4         now.

5              (At sidebar.)

6              MR. WALKER: Judge, these have highlighting

7         on them that I don't believe was part of the ad.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=220
8         The copies that we received from Mr. Uiterwyk

9         previously were black and white copies.

10              MR. UITERWYK: There's highlighting we've got

11          on the ad, but I'm going to be referring to the

12         highlight to save time. The reason I used these

13         notebooks, Your Honor, is because it's very

14         difficult to see these on the ELMO or on the

15         screen.

16              THE COURT: Okay. Well --

17              MR. WALKER: I don't object to the jury

18         seeing evidence as it's going to be received, but

19         evidence with highlighting on it that's not going

20         to be received in this format, I think, is

21          inappropriate, Your Honor.

22              MR. UITERWYK: You're just now realizing

23         that?

24              MR. WALKER: You gave us black and white

25         copies. What you showed us --2917

1              MR. UITERWYK: I gave you this this morning.

2         I gave you this --

3              MR. WALKER: You told me it was the same as

4         what you gave --

5              MR. UITERWYK: How many pages are we talking

6         about? Which ones are you talking about? What

7         tab number?

8              MR. WALKER: Tab 1 is a 1959 ad with

9         highlighting.

10              Tab 5 has highlighting, extensive

11          highlighting on every ad in 5, it appears, or most

12         of them.

13              MR. PEDROSA: Looks like all but two -- or

14         all but three in tab 5.

15              MR. WALKER: Tab 7 has highlighting. Tab 8

16         has highlighting. Tab 9 has highlighting. And

17         tab 10 has highlighting.

18              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'll take the

19         highlighting off when we go back, when we offer it

20         into evidence, but I don't want to take it off

21          now. I can't, number one. Number two, it's no

22         different than if I had it on the ELMO and they

23         were looking at it.

24              THE COURT: How is it different than putting

25         it up on the ELMO and highlighting certain 2918

1         paragraphs?

2              MR. WALKER: Because he's asking them -- he

3         is giving this to them -- he's publishing this to

4         them in a way that's very different than putting

5         it on the screen. If I came in -- for example,

6         our expert historian has school books that we

7         often publish to the jury, but not with tabs and

8         highlighting. That --tabs and highlighting is

9         something you can do with a demonstrative, but

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=221
10         this is being given to them as the evidence that's

11          going into the case, and it's not. We don't hand

12         out -- we don't hand out demonstratives to the

13         jury, typically.

14              MR. UITERWYK: This is not demonstratives.

15         These are ads.

16              MR. WALKER: If you have highlighting on

17         them, they're demonstratives.

18              MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry. How many exhibits

19         have we put up there with underlining on it?

20              THE COURT: I'm going to overrule your

21          objection. The one going back to the jury will

22         have -- won't have any highlights, but --

23              MR. WALKER: In that instance, will

24         Mr. Uiterwyk explain that the highlighting was

25         done by the lawyers, the plaintiffs lawyers? 2919

1              MR. UITERWYK: Sure.

2              THE COURT: Okay. Sure.

3              (Sidebar concluded.)

4              THE COURT: Are you moving this into

5         evidence?

6              MR. UITERWYK: I was until I dropped my

7         binder.

8              THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk, give me one minute.

9              Members of the jury, it's my intention to go

10         to five o'clock today. And we had a break a

11          little while ago. If you want to just stand in

12         place and stretch for a minute, we can do that

13         because, frankly, I'm going to do that. And I

14         don't think you should be any worse off than me.

15         So if you would like to stand and stretch for a

16         second, please feel free. We'll just take a

17         30-second recess in place here.

18              (Brief recess taken.)

19              MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, may we approach

20         while taking the 30-minute standing recess?

21               THE COURT: Thirty-second.

22              MR. PEDROSA: Thirty-second. I apologize.

23              THE COURT: Yes.

24              (At sidebar.)

25              MR. PEDROSA: While we were taking the 2920

1         recess, I predict that we will be making some

2         objections on the ads based on the all cases order

3         on meaning and intent of documents. And I just

4         wanted to have an opportunity to make the point to

5         Your Honor that this should be very different than

6         some of the other testimony that you've admitted,

7         because advertisements are within the common

8         experience of the jury. It doesn't take an expert

9         to tell them what this advertisement is saying.

10              And so to the extent that this expert intends

11          to say, Well, the message being conveyed here is,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=222
12         that would be completely out of bounds and

13         inconsistent with the all cases order.

14              So because I imagine I'll be standing up and

15         just saying objection, meaning and intent, I

16         wanted to share with Your Honor what I think about

17         how it applies here.

18              THE COURT: I understand.

19              MR. UITERWYK: There is -- there are some

20         ads, Your Honor, that he's aware of what the

21         program was about where they took -- where they

22         said one out of three people who are sensitive to

23         tar did the test which showed --

24              THE COURT: Show me the ad. What number?

25              MR. UITERWYK: Under 5. 2921

1              THE COURT: All right. What do you intend to

2         ask him about that?

3              MR. UITERWYK: Just what is that referring

4         to, what he understands.

5              MR. PEDROSA: And, Your Honor, they can't

6         have it both ways. The argument is that this

7         shaped the environment and that the ads were out

8         there and this is what consumers would have been

9         impacted by, but they don't have an expert

10         following them around telling them how to

11          interpret the ad. So to have an expert come in

12         here and tell the jury how to read these documents

13         when it's not outside the common experience of the

14         jury is improper expert testimony.

15              THE COURT: Okay. It would seem to me that

16         there may be more than one way he might be able to

17         explain a document, one, if the document has

18         some -- if the words have some special meaning,

19         which I've been operating under on my rulings up

20         to this point.

21               But it would seem to me that if the words are

22         ordinary words that don't have some special

23         meaning, that he may -- if a proper predicate is

24         laid, may still testify to them in his field of

25         public health in terms of how these words affect 2922

1         the consuming public.

2              MR. UITERWYK: Particularly as it relates to

3         advertising, cigarette advertising. He's actually

4         done research and it's discussed quite a bit, the

5         research --

6              THE COURT: Well, you're going to have to lay

7         your predicate because it seems to me that based

8         on his qualifications as -- and that was the word

9         I was looking for before, epidemiologist in public

10         health -- that I don't know whether or not --1

11          suspect he does, but I'll have to hear from him,

12         he studies how ads are put together to affect the

13         consuming public from -- you know, how marketing

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=223
14         works.

15              If he establishes his expertise in that area

16         as part of his role as an epidemiologist, then he

17         may, depending upon what he says, testify as to

18         the significance of some of these ordinary words

19         because they may have some different meaning, so

20         to speak, in terms of marketing than what they

21          would have on just in ordinary print.

22              MR. UITERWYK: I'm going to actually go

23         through, Your Honor, his experience and his

24         research that he's done in the field of cigarette

25         smoking ads and the effect that it had both on 2923

1          smokers as well as the --

2              THE COURT: Well, it has to be tied into his

3         field, his expertise. He just can't testify as to

4         what it is, because the jury would be free to do

5         that if it doesn't have any special knowledge. If

6         it has some effect in terms of marketing that

7         he -- that he is -- that he uses in terms of his

8         public health, then he may. But you're going to

9         have to lay a predicate.

10              MR. WALKER: If I may, Judge, the other side

11          of the coin that you're going to hear is not so

12         much about meaning but about intent.

13              Typically, what happens is these documents

14         are put in, a document will have a word like

15          "taste" in it. And he'll say, What was the intent

16         of the company in putting out an ad like this?

17         And that is what -- that is another area that's

18         expressly precluded under Judge Barton's ruling.

19              MR. UITERWYK: I don't know what I'm going to

20         do --

21               THE COURT: Well, you need to lay a --

22              MR. UITERWYK: I understand.

23              THE COURT: -- proper predicate before you

24         ask those questions. We'll just have to take them

25         up one at a time. They may have special meaning 2924

1         in his field.

2              MR. UITERWYK: Like, for instance, there is

3         one that's called the T Zone. And it's -- the

4         T Zone is actually -- relation of what the T Zone

5         is and how they market it.

6              There's also an explanation with regard to

7         one of the ads talk about "try it for 30 days."

8         Well, that's important because from their

9         perspective and his perspective, it's an

10         introduction to an addiction. People who start

11          smoking cigarettes and regularly smoke cigarettes

12         for 30 days become addicted within 30 days.

13              THE COURT: All right. Well, lay a

14         predicate, and we'll take it up at that time.

15              MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=224
16              (Sidebar concluded.)

17              THE COURT: All right. We're ready to

18         proceed.

19              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I would like to

20         mark this ad book.

21               THE COURT: And the ad book, what is it, for

22         the record?

23              MR. UITERWYK: PT -- sorry -- AU 126.

24              THE COURT: All right. I've overruled the

25         defendants' objections. It's received in 2925

1          evidence. Please make reference to the

2         highlighting.

3              (Exhibit No. AU 126 received.)

4              MR. UITERWYK: Now, before we go -

5         Your Honor, the ad book does have, on certain of

6         the ads, highlighting. It's only for the purposes

7         of identifying those portions that I may be

8         referring to in connection with Dr. Cummings'

9         testimony. And when we bring back -- when we

10         bring back this evidence, we'll have removed the

11          highlighting.

12              THE COURT: They were added by the lawyers.

13              MR. UITERWYK: I added them. I did them --

14         correction, Dr. Cummings and I did them.

15     BY MR. UITERWYK:

16         Q.   All right. Dr. Cummings, before we start

17     talking about this ad and about ads in general, can you

18     tell the jury what work you have done in the field of

19     smoking behavior as it relates to ads? And we talked

20     about your experience with marketing and marketing to

21      the youth and marketing to the addicted smoker and

22     marketing of health -- the health -- the health --

23     safer cigarette type marketing.

24              I want you to tell the jury briefly your

25     experience that you've had, your research and study 2926

1     that you've done in this particular area.

2         A.   In advertising?

3         Q.   Yes.

4         A.   Sure. I've designed, executed, and evaluated

5     mass media campaigns on a range of topics for my

6     employer, Roswell Park, having to do with encouraging

7     people to call our state quit line, encouraging people

8     to try to quit smoking with, you know, mass media types

9     of both print, electronic, radio advertising.

10         Q.   But as it relates to cigarette advertising.

11          A.   Sure -- well, I mean, advertising is

12     advertising. You're trying to sell something,

13     essentially.

14              I've also studied extensively and have

15     collections of cigarette advertising and have plotted

16     the growth of certain brands of cigarettes and

17     categories of cigarettes, such as filters and low tar,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=225
18     as well as particular brands or brand segments, like

19     youth, in terms of the amount of advertising and the

20     type of advertising that was utilized to appeal to

21      different segments of the population.

22              So I've accumulated those ads. I've looked

23     at the marketing budgets of those ads. I've studied

24     the internal business records of the company with

25     regards to their conclusions about the statement of the 2927

1      success of their advertising, how much money they put

2     into it, the themes that were working best with which

3     audiences. I've written articles on that topic. I've

4     reviewed and contributed to monographs that have been

5     published by our federal agencies. The National Cancer

6     Institute did a monograph on the impact of advertising,

7     both pro and con, in the tobacco area, Monograph 19,

8     which is probably the most recent source of information

9     for the public on that topic.

10         Q.   All right. And turning to the first ad --

11      and we're going to go through these fairly quickly.

12     The jury has got these ads.

13              Turning to the first ad under tab 1, it says,

14     "Camels are always fresh," and they have a picture of

15     this young woman smoking.

16              Are these the kind of images that the

17     industry was putting forward in this time frame and

18     thereafter of the kind of people -- age of people who

19     smoked cigarettes?

20         A.   Yes. This is an ad from the 1930s. As I

21      mentioned before, uptake of smoking occurred in large

22     numbers primarily among men right around the end of

23     World War I. And in the early '30s, late '20s, early

24     '30s, companies like R.J. Reynolds -- this is a Camel

25     ad -- were turning their sights on trying to recruit 2928

1     young women as smokers because they were an untapped

2     market where they could expand their sales.

3         Q.   And did they -- like in this ad, they say,

4     "Switch to Camels and learn the mildness of a fresh

5     cool-burning cigarette. A blend of choice Turkish and

6     mellow, sun-ripened domestic tobaccos, Camels are never

7     parched or toasted. That's why we smoke them -- that's

8     why we say, Smoke them for one day and then leave them

9     if you can."

10              Now, did they market the mildness of

11      cigarettes particularly as it relates to the teen or

12     young smoker?

13         A.   Yes.

14         Q.   For what reason --

15         A.   Well-

16         Q.    based on your studies?

17         A.   Well, you know, basically in order -- they

18     knew mildness and the ability to inhale the smoke was

19     key to attracting, you know, new smokers to the brand.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=226
20         Q.   And do we also have additional ads that do

21      the same for Camels behind the next one?

22         A.   Yes. This is from the same period. This is

23     a little bit later into the '40s, I believe, for Camel

24     cigarettes. But again, you know, the theme there,

25     taste and mildness, that was one of the themes for 2929

1     their advertising. And going after obviously young

2     women in school.

3         Q.   And for instance, did they do a number of ads

4     with young girls in connection with football games?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And did Winston also do that as well? And

7     what time frame were you talking about here?

8         A.   Well, this is in the year --

9         Q.   Go ahead.

10         A.   The 1950s. Winston has introduced in 1954,

11      and they commonly used, I guess, boy-girl kinds of

12     themes.

13         Q.   Now, Lucky. Who manufactured Lucky?

14         A.   Lucky was American Tobacco.

15         Q.   Who owns American Tobacco Company today?

16         A.   R.J.Reynolds.

17              MR. WALKER: May we have the date of that

18         last ad, Your Honor?

19              THE COURT: Yes.

20              THE WITNESS: Lucky ad? This Lucky ad, I

21         believe, is early 1950s. Around 1953,1 believe.

22     BY MR. UITERWYK:

23         Q.   Around the time that Jackie Loyd smoked?

24         A.   Yeah. "Be Happy - Go Lucky."

25         Q.   About the time when she began to smoke? 2930

1         A.   Yes, sir.

2         Q.   And again, were they marketing the mildness

3     and rich taste? Did they actually manipulate the

4     cigarettes to give the mild flavor during -- and

5     appealing to the younger smokers?

6              MR. WALKER: Objection, compound question.

7              THE COURT: Sustained.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   Did they manipulate the cigarettes to give

10     them a milder flavor in order to have the younger

11      smokers take it up?

12         A.   Yes. They manipulated primarily through

13     blend of the product in this period, although Camel

14     introduced reconstituted tobacco. They were the first

15     to do that in commercial cigarettes in 1950.

16         Q.   And we got Lucky Strike, again. Who's that?

17         A.   Again, this is part of the same campaign.

18         Q.   Was this Lucky Strike, American Tobacco

19     Company?

20         A.   Yes.

21          Q.   RJR?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=227
22         A.   Yes. They are now RJR, right.

23         Q.   This is actually the 1952 ad, is it not?

24         A.   Correct.

25         Q.   It refers -- it has the young lady there, 2931

1     prom ticket?

2         A.   Correct.

3         Q.   Now, did Winston also continue with that, and

4     RJR continued with that ad? And we'll be talking about

5     the filter blend and Winston's secret of selective

6     tobacco especially processed for filter smoking. We

7     discussed that earlier, but we will be discussing that

8     in a little bit, correct, Doctor?

9         A.   Yeah, it was one of their main themes they

10     used.  "It's what's up front that counts." And they

11      talked about the filter blend which was actually

12     something new about Winston. They did a different

13     blend of the product.

14         Q.   And this is a Marlboro ad with a baby on it?

15         A.   Yes. This predates the -- there were some

16     Winston -- or Marlboro is primarily a cigarette aimed

17     at females prior to 1954, and then Philip Morris

18     changed it to a product aimed at men using -- macho men

19     primarily with tattoos in the '50s, and then they

20     changed that over to the cowboy in the early 1960s.

21               MR. WALKER: May we have a date on the

22         Marlboro ad?

23              THE COURT: Yes.

24              THE WITNESS: Marlboro ad?

25              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, if he wants to 2932

1          cross-examine him.

2              THE COURT: I've sustained his objection.

3         Date?

4              THE WITNESS: I don't have the actual date on

5         this particular one. It predates 1954.

6     BY MR. UITERWYK:

7         Q.   All right. Now, did the cigarette companies,

8     including Winston, Camel, RJR in particular, use common

9     type ads in order to promote their cigarettes?

10         A.   Yes.

11          Q.   And is what we're looking here the great

12     stagecoach robbery of basically marketing Winston

13     cigarettes? Do you know when this was, approximately?

14         A.   This is in the '50s, and it was part of the

15     Puck comic series which appeared in the Sunday funnies

16     and Reynolds ran advertisements as part of the Sunday

17     funnies from the '30s through the 1950s.

18         Q.   And you have another one here, another type

19     of ad like that which, "You'd be so nice to come home

20     to." And that's a Winston ad as well, "Winston tastes

21      good like a cigarette should"?

22         A.   Correct.

23         Q.   And then we have another one, a Winston ad.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=228
24     Was this all around the same time frame?

25         A.   Yes. This last one was 1957. 2933

1          Q.   You mentioned that they -- where did they

2     place these ads?

3         A.   They were in the Sunday funnies. Sort of

4     like a product placement in movies except they were

5     doing this as a product placement in the funnies pages.

6         Q.   All right. And was there evidence -- have

7     you seen the records that actually Jackie Loyd looked

8     at the funnies?

9              MR. WALKER: Objection, hearsay.

10              THE COURT: Sustained. Lay a predicate.

11      BY MR. UITERWYK:

12         Q.   Now, did Camel use, through comic strips,

13     which used athletes?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   And they have in here, "The smoke of slower

16     burning Camels gives you extra mildness, extra

17     coolness, extra flavor and" --1 don't know if it's 28

18     percent or 38 percent less nicotine. Is that --

19         A.   Twenty-eight.

20         Q.   Did they also say that they add additional

21      cigarettes to the pack?

22         A.   They said you get more because they burn

23     slower.

24         Q.   And was this again controlling the burn rate?

25         A.   Yes. 2934

1          Q.   And based on your research in this area, was

2     there less nicotine?

3         A.   Well, the smoker wouldn't get less nicotine;

4     on the machine, according to the tests. I don't know

5     the actual tests that they did for this particular ad.

6         Q.   All right.

7              MR. WALKER: May we have the date for that

8         one, Your Honor?

9              THE WITNESS: I don't have the date. I

10         believe it's in the 1940s when they ran it.

11      BY MR. UITERWYK:

12         Q.   Then did they use an ad with circus stars --

13     actual circus stars to promote Camel?

14         A.   Yes. These were in the 1930s.

15         Q.   All right. Then we go to the last ad, which

16     is, "It's fun to be fooled." Was this a series of ads

17     run by Camel?

18         A.   It was. It was where you could write away

19     and get the magic book and learn magic tricks. And

20     this was again part of -- this is in the 1930s, for

21      Camel cigarettes.

22         Q.   Now, the tobacco industry, including Reynolds

23     and Lorillard, include health claims and use

24     celebrities to promote their ads?

25         A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=229
2935

1          Q.   Let's look at Tab 2. And was Ava Gabor --

2     for those who may be younger and don't remember her,

3     but those older remember her. Was Ava Gabor a popular

4     celebrity during the times?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And did they do similar ads, "Not one single

7     case of throat irritation due to smoking Camels"?

8         A.   Correct. This was in the 1940s. And this

9     was one of their main marketing claims was it was less

10     throat irritation due to smoking Camels.

11          Q.   In the bottom right-hand corner, it says,

12     quote, Make your own sensible 30-day Camel mild test in

13     your T zone; T for throat, T for taste. Did I read

14     that right?

15         A.   That's right.

16         Q.   Based on your experience, when somebody

17     smokes 30 days, do they start absorbing -- do people

18     usually start inhaling smoke by that period in time?

19         A.   Yes, they do. That's been my experience.

20         Q.   And what were they referring to, the T zone?

21          A.   Well, they're talking about --

22              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, the

23         document speaks for itself.

24              THE COURT: Sustained.

25     BY MR. UITERWYK: 2936

1          Q.   Let's go on.

2              In the '40s and '50s and '60s, what kind of

3     resources did the industry, including Reynolds and

4     Lorillard, throw behind the marketing?

5              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, relevance, 403,

6         financial resources.

7              THE COURT: Overruled.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   Go ahead.

10         A.   They were spending --

11               THE COURT: Approach, please.

12              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'll withdraw the

13         question.

14              THE COURT: Okay.

15     BY MR. UITERWYK:

16         Q.   Again, we have another ad where they're using

17     a celebrity, "I've made those mildness tests, you've

18     read about my choice is Camels."

19              Again, do they market and is this typical for

20     what they've been doing for decades at that time, early

21      decades, '40s and '50s, marketing these cigarettes,

22     mild in order to get the pre-smoker involved in

23     smoking, through your study?

24         A.   Yes. These were celebrities, Joan Crawford,

25     who appeared in motion pictures. There was often 2937

1     cross-referencing of the pictures that they appeared

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=230
2     in.

3         Q.   If we go to tab--

4              MR. WALKER: I'm sorry. Could we have the

5         date of the Joan Crawford ad?

6              THE WITNESS: It's 1940s.

7     BY MR. UITERWYK:

8         Q.   And did they use athletes and others to

9     advertise their products and promote the healthy part

10     of like, "They don't get your wind"?

11          A.   Yes. This was a campaign from the 1930s.

12         Q.   By Camels?

13         A.   Yes. 1933 is this particular ad in the

14     Saturday Evening Post. And again, different popular

15     athletes of the day talking about testimonials of them

16     smoking Camel cigarettes.

17         Q.   And do they show a number of athletes, "And

18     so mild you can smoke all you want"?

19         A.   That's what they said.

20         Q.   All right. And was that continued in the

21      '40s and the'50s?

22         A.   They did use athletes in the '40s and '50s

23     and the '60s.

24         Q.   All right. And we're going on.

25              MR. WALKER: Can we have the date of the ad 2938

1         that's been published?

2              THE WITNESS: The "Don't get your wind" ad?

3         This is early 1930s.

4     BY MR. UITERWYK:

5         Q.   Now, Doctor, let's go to another tab in Tab

6     4. Are these some of the examples -- are we going to

7     see some of the examples of how they used doctors and

8     other medical professionals that were used by Lorillard

9     and Reynolds to sell their products?

10         A.   Yes.

11          Q.   Let's talk about this ad for a minute,

12     Doctor. Can you give us the back story of where they

13     got the information? It says, "According to a recent

14     nationwide survey, more doctors smoke Camels than any

15     other cigarette." When was this ad run?

16         A.   They ran the "More doctors smoke Camel"

17     campaign in the early 1950s. And the latest was

18     done --

19         Q.   Again -- go ahead?

20         A.   The William Esty Company, which was their

21      advertising firm, went to the American Medical

22     Association meeting. They put free cartons of

23     cigarettes in the hotel rooms for all the doctors.

24     Half of them were smoking in that period of time.

25              They waited a day for the doctors to use up 2939

1     their brand, and then they asked the doctors as they

2     came down to their meeting and said, Doctor, what brand

3     of cigarettes do you have with you today? More doctors

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=231
4     smoke Camel than any other brand; all branches of

5     medicine, all parts of the United States, all

6     specialties. And that was part of their marketing

7     claim.

8         Q.   And did they continue with those doctor-type

9     ads?

10         A.   Yes. It was a very successful ad campaign

11      for Camel. And since this occurred in the early '50s,

12     television was coming out and they had not only print

13     ads like this, but they have also had this campaign on

14     the TV ads.

15              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'm going to offer

16         and introduce into evidence PT 517, which is a

17         video.

18              THE COURT: Are you going to play it now?

19              MR. UITERWYK: lam.

20              THE COURT: Okay. Have you seen it?

21               MR. WALKER: I have not seen it. But if it's

22         represented to be, Your Honor, he's already

23         addressed our objection.

24              MR. UITERWYK: This ad --

25              THE COURT: All right. Sorry. Do you have 2940

1          any objections to it? I didn't hear.

2              MR. WALKER: None other than have already

3         been made, Your Honor.

4              THE COURT: Then it will be received.

5              (Exhibit No. PT 517 received.)

6     BY MR. UITERWYK:

7         Q.   And what -- is this ad similar to what the

8     print ad, More doctors smoke Camel than any other

9     cigarette?

10         A.   It's part of the same campaign.

11          Q.   Approximately what time was this video being

12     shown on TV?

13         A.   1951.

14         Q.   And is this --

15              MR. UITERWYK: Can we show that please,

16         Baron?

17     BY MR. UITERWYK:

18         Q.   Was this widely run?

19         A.   Yes, it was.

20              (Exhibit PT 517 was published to the jury.)

21               "How often does your job call you out of bed

22         in the middle of the night? Well, if you're a

23         doctor, it would be often. And generally, there

24         isn't much time to spare.

25               "Coffee, Doctor? 2941

1               "Oh, fine.

3               "Thanks.

6         pleasure.

7              "Yes, folks, the pleasing mildness of a Camel

8         is just as enjoyable to a doctor as it is to you

9         or me.

10              "In a nationwide survey, doctors in all

11         branches of medicine were asked, What cigarette do

12         you smoke, Doctor? The brand name most was

13         Camels. Tens of thousands of doctors, general

14         practitioners, surgeons, specialists, doctors in

15         every branch of medicine were included.

16              "And according to this nationwide survey,

17         more doctors smoked Camels than any other

18         cigarette. Try Camels yourself. The cigarette so

19         many doctors enjoy."

20     BY MR. UITERWYK:

21          Q.   Was that the same survey that was mentioned

22     in the ad that you talked about earlier?

23         A.   Yeah.

24         Q.   All right. And did they also run video or

25     advertising --1 don't know if they had video at that 2942

1     time. I guess it was films. Did they also run other

2     ads -- Camel run other ads during that time frame with

3     regard to the 30 days, Try it for 30 days?

4         A.   Yes.

5         Q.   All right.

6              MR. UITERWYK: I'm going to offer and

7         introduce into evidence, Your Honor, PT 543.

8              MR. WALKER: Can we have a date, please?

9              MR. UITERWYK: What date is it, do you know?

10              THE WITNESS: I don't know.

11               MR. UITERWYK: Have you tried a Camel?

12              THE WITNESS: Yeah, early 1950s.

13              MR. WALKER: No additional objections.

14              THE COURT: All right. It will be received.

15              (Exhibit No. PT 543 received.)

16              (Exhibit No. PT 543 was published to the

17         jury.)

18               "What cigarette do you smoke? You'll be

19         interested to know how the doctors of America

20         answered that question. Tens of thousands of

21          doctors. Doctors in all parts of the country, in

22         every state of the union. Doctors in every branch

23         of medicine were asked, What cigarette do you

24         smoke, Doctor?

25               "In this nationwide survey of general 2943

1         practitioners, surgeons, throat specialists,

8         your T zone.

9              "Smoke only Camels for 30 days. Enjoy

10         Camel's rich full flavor and see how well Camels

11          agree with your throat, pack after pack, week

13         popular with the doctors of America."

14     BY MR. UITERWYK:

15         Q.   And did they -- on these ads, did the person

16     who's smoking a cigarette inhale it?

17         A.   Yes.

18         Q.   And did they -- when they talked about

19     smoking pack after pack, what were they trying to do,

20     based on your research and study?

21               MR. WALKER: Objection, calls for

22         speculation.

23     BY MR. UITERWYK:

24         Q.   For 30 days?

25              THE COURT: Overruled. 2944

1              THE WITNESS: They were trying to sell

2         cigarettes and they were trying to get people to

3         try their brand of cigarettes for a 30-day test so

4         either they would switch away from a competitor's

5         brand or start using their brand.

6     BY MR. UITERWYK:

7         Q.   And after 30 days, did they become

8     addicted -- a high risk of becoming addicted, based on

9     your experience?

10              MR. WALKER: Objection.

11               THE COURT: Overruled.

12              THE WITNESS: Yes.

13     BY MR. UITERWYK:

14         Q.   Now, let's go back to some ads we were

15     looking at, print ads for a moment. And we're going to

16     go look at Tab No. 5, which are Kent ads.

17              And do they also use doctors to promote or to

18     basically promote their cigarettes? We were going to

19     talk about where these ads were placed.

20         A.   Sure. When Kent came out in 1952, they

21      certainly promoted it with marketing about doctors

22     smoking Kent cigarettes and they marketed directly to

23     doctors.

24              MR. UITERWYK: Can I switch to the ELMO?

25     BY MR. UITERWYK: 2945

1          Q.   Where did these ads run, the next couple,

2     three that we're going to be looking at, where they

3     talk about doctors?

4         A.   Well, the Kent campaign ran a variety of

5     places, but one of the places it ran were medical

6     journals including Journal of the American Medical

7     Association.

8         Q.   And in this ad it says, "Why is it, Doctor,

9     that one filter cigarette gives so much more protection

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=234
10     than any other?"

11               Did Kent cigarettes give so much more

12     protection than any other?

13              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, design opinion.

14              THE COURT: Mr. Pedrosa, I'm having trouble

15         hearing you.

16              MR. PEDROSA: I apologize, Your Honor. I

17         said objection, it's an opinion on design.

18              THE COURT: Overruled.

19     BY MR. UITERWYK:

20         Q.   Go ahead.

21          A.   No.

22         Q.   They also say here -- does it also say

23     here -- I'll zoom in on it again. "For these

24     reasons -- and it talks about various reasons of the

25     filter, the Micronite filter -- "and Micronite filter 2946

1     lets smokers enjoy the full satisfying flavor of fine,

2     mellow tobacco. For these reasons, Doctor, shouldn't

3     Kent be the choice of those who want the minimum of

4     nicotine and tars in their cigarette smoke?"

5              Did I read that right?

6         A.   Yes.

7         Q.   And did this Micronite filter that was

8     marketed, was it safer? Was it healthier? Did it give

9     a minimum amount of nicotine and tar?

10         A.   It was not safer and, no, it wouldn't give

11      you less nicotine and tar, because people would

12     compensate.

13         Q.   And, Doctor, looking at the next ad, "Have

14     you tried this experiment, Doctor?"

15              Where were these ads run?

16         A.   Well, these ads were run in medical journals

17     like the American Medical Association, as I mentioned.

18     They also ran in -- versions of these ads also ran

19     in -- in more public kinds of advertising.

20         Q.   All right. Were they asking the doctor to

21      test their experiment with their filter and their

22     cigarettes?

23         A.   Yes.

24              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, the document speaks

25         for itself. 2947

1              THE COURT: Sustained.

2              MR. PEDROSA: Move to strike the answer.

3     BY MR. UITERWYK:

4         Q.   Doctor, the next one --

5              THE COURT: Overruled.

6     BY MR. UITERWYK:

7         Q.    we'll go over quickly. The next one is

8     some question about filter cigarettes that may have

9     occurred to you, Doctor. Did you research why they

10     were advertising cigarettes, filtered cigarettes to

11      doctors?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=235
12         A.   Yes.

13         Q.   Why?

14              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, intent of the

15         company documents. I apologize.

16              THE COURT: It's either a little -- I'm

17         sorry.

18              MR. PEDROSA: I'll stand up.

19              THE COURT: Okay. You can project.

20              MR. PEDROSA: Meaning and intent of company

21          documents.

22              THE COURT: What was the question?

23              MR. UITERWYK: Did you research as to why

24         they were advertising to doctors the Micronite

25         filter in Kent cigarettes. 2948

1              THE COURT: That objection is overruled.

2              MR. WALKER: My objection is pursuant to Your

3         Honor's Williams' ruling with respect to this

4         Camel.

5              THE COURT: That objection is overruled, too.

6         Thank you.

7              THE WITNESS: Yes, I have.

8     BY MR. UITERWYK:

9         Q.   What did you determine in that regard?

10         A.   They were marketing to doctors because

11      doctors were reading the evidence coming out of their

12     medical journals. Half of them were smokers. And by

13     introducing filtered cigarettes to them, particularly

14     Kent cigarettes to get them to adopt that brand, they

15     would pass that information on to their patients. And

16     that was the intent of marketing to doctors. They not

17     only ran ads, but they did send free cigarettes to

18     doctors who's part of the American Medical Association

19     mailing list.

20              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, nonresponsive. Move

21          to strike.

22              THE COURT: Overruled.

23     BY MR. UITERWYK:

24         Q.   Going on to the next Kent ad. To one out of

25     every three smokers. Here's how you can get the 2949

1     protection you really need against nicotine and tar,

2     and the smoking pleasure you want.

3              Were there a series of ads ever run by Kent

4     like this?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And which cigarettes -- the next one, which

7     cigarette gives you the greatest health protection?

8              MR. WALKER: Judge, may we have the date of

9         the one just published?

10              MR. UITERWYK: Sure.

11      BY MR. UITERWYK:

12         Q.   Do you know the date on this one?

13         A.   1954.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=236
14         Q.   And the date on this one?

15         A.   '54.

16         Q.   Which cigarette gives you the greatest health

17     protection? Does any cigarette -- did any cigarette

18     of -- as a matter of fact, by Lorillard, give -- no

19     matter what, you had a Micronite filter, no matter what

20     kind of filter, did they give any health protection?

21               MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. May we

22         approach on this?

23              THE COURT: Okay.

24              MR. UITERWYK: Let me rephrase the question.

25              MR. WALKER: It won't -2950

1              MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

2              (At sidebar.)

3              MR. UITERWYK: You may overrule it, but --

4              MR. WALKER: Judge, as we discussed this

5         morning, this is a concealment case. This is not

6         a case about misrepresentations or false

7         advertising or false statements in advertising.

8         Though there were findings for misrepresentation,

9         they were not upheld by the Florida Supreme Court,

10         and they've not pled any claim for false

11          advertising or for misleading or false statements

12         in advertising.

13              And that's what we've been getting from the

14         last few of these ads. Here's what the ad says,

15         was that true? That's a misrepresentation claim,

16         and there's no such claim in this case.

17              MR. UITERWYK: What we're going to do, Your

18         Honor, we're going to show a document, but this

19         isn't misrepresentation, this is concealment.

20         They concealed all the facts. We're going to show

21          how they concealed and the facts, and how what

22         they were saying. That's all part of the

23         concealment.

24              MR. WALKER: I don't know what --

25              MR. UITERWYK: Let me finish, please. 2951

1              What they said on one hand with regard to

2         cigarettes being fine, cigarettes being healthy,

3         and what they really knew, that's what we're

4         talking about concealment.

5              THE COURT: Let me make sure there are --1

6         think there were four claims in this case. There

7         was negligence, strict liability, fraudulent

8         concealing, and what's the fourth?

9              MR. UITERWYK: Conspiracy.

10              MR. WALKER: Conspiracy to fraudulently

11          conceal. Conspiracy to fraudulently conceal.

12              THE COURT: Okay. Well, wouldn't -- could

13         there be some overlap between concealment and

14         misrepresentation?

15              MR. WALKER: Not in the questions that he's

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=237
16         asking. If you show a statement and then you ask

17         if that statement is true, that's not concealment.

18         That's misrepresentation. What he's saying he's

19         going to do in the future, maybe that will be

20         okay. I've only objected to what he's done so

21          far.

22              He's showed the "more doctors" and he talked

23         about how the study was done, the implication

24         being that it was a false or somehow misleading

25         statement. That's not concealment. The claim 2952

1         they have is based on concealment of the health

2         risks, not false statements.

3              MR. UITERWYK: This is very much concealment.

4         That's exactly --

5              MR. WALKER: That's not what the question

6         was.

7              MR. UITERWYK: They're basically concealing

8         the health risk by doing these -- number one, by

9         doing these ads. Number two, they promote these

10         ads, and then behind the scenes they know that and

11          they know that these are not healthier cigarettes,

12         and they conceal that information from the public.

13              THE COURT: You're going to have to rephrase

14         the question with respect to these particular ads.

15              MR. UITERWYK: I was going to do that.

16              MR. WALKER: All right. Thank you.

17              THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk -

18              MR. UITERWYK: Yes, Your Honor.

19              THE COURT: -- move thin into the claims that

20         you've pled in this matter.

21               MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

22              MR. WALKER: Thank you, Your Honor.

23              THE COURT: Oh, Mr. Uiterwyk, I'm sorry.

24              I would like to finish with these ads today.

25         You're not going to be able to do that by 5:00. 2953

1              MR. UITERWYK: Particularly not the Winston

2         ads.

3              THE COURT: Pardon me?

4              MR. UITERWYK: I'm not going to be able to do

5         that with the Winston ads.

6              THE COURT: What time do you think?

7              MR. UITERWYK: The Winston ads are going to

8         take a while. It also talks about reviewing

9         documents, and that's what we're going to be

10         doing. We're going to be reviewing documents.

11               THE COURT: When you reach a convenient break

12         point around five o'clock, then we'll break for

13         the day.

14              MR. UITERWYK: What I'll do is I'll try to

15         get through the ads with the exception of the

18         to you.

19              MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

20              (Sidebar concluded.)

21      BY MR. UITERWYK:

22         Q.   Now, this particular ad which is under Tab

23     No. 5,1 believe -- Tab No. 5, Which cigarette gives

24     you the greatest health protection?

25              Did -- during this -- what time frame is 2954

1     this?

2         A.   This particular ad was 1954. Kent came out

3     in 1952, and one of the top selling cigarettes in the

4     country.

5         Q.   Is this near the time or shortly before the

6     time when the 50-year cover-up started --

7         A.   Yes.

8         Q.   -- by the cigarette companies?

9         A.   Yes, it is.

10         Q.   Where they basically concealed from the

11     public the health effects as well as the addictive

12     nature of cigarettes?

13              MR. WALKER: Objection, leading and

14         argumentative.

15              MR. PEDROSA: Objection.

16              THE COURT: Sustained.

17     BY MR. UITERWYK:

18         Q.   We briefly -- what was the cover-up about?

19              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, repetitive.

20              THE COURT: Overruled.

21               THE WITNESS: Companies basically did not

22         divulge what they knew about the health risks of

23         their product and told their consumers that their

24         products were safe to use and if there were any

25         problem, they would fix them. 2955

1     BY MR. UITERWYK:

2         Q.   What they said in this particular ad was

3     cigarettes gave you the greatest health protection.

4     Did you have information that Lorillard, in fact, knew

5     that its cigarettes were not healthy?

6         A.   Yes.

7         Q.   And so what they said in this ad was

8     different than what they knew internally?

9         A.   Yes, sir.

10         Q.   We'll talk about that a little more later.

11      And did they also use other individuals to -- all over

12     America, more scientists and educators smoke Kent with

13     a Micronite filter than any other cigarette. Were they

14     marketing the Micronite filter during this time frame,

15     the '50s?

16         A.   Yes. They used the Micronite label for a

17     number of years.

18         Q.   Did they also market the Micronite filter as

19     being used or the material in the filter being used in

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=239
20     hospitals and nuclear plants?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   And were the Micronite filters serving any

23     purpose as far as the cigarette smoke was concerned and

24     inhalation?

25              MR. PEDROSA: Objection, argumentative and 2956

1         repetitive, asked and answered.

2              MR. UITERWYK: I didn't ask about the

3         Micronite filters.

4              THE COURT: Sustained.

5     BY MR. UITERWYK:

6         Q.   All right. Let me go on.

7              And in this particular ad, You feel better

8     about smoking with the taste of Kent. When was that?

9         A.   1961.

10         Q.   "And Kent with the Micronite filter refines

11      away harsh flavor, refines away hot taste, and makes

12     the taste of the cigarette mild."

13              Now, did they ventilate these cigarettes?

14         A.   Not in this time period, no.

15         Q.   All right. And going back to TV ads, if we

16     could for a few minutes before we break for the day,

17     did some of the ads even instruct or talk about --

18     about inhaling and do you inhale?

19         A.   Yes.

20              MR. UITERWYK: And we're about to see PT 588,

21          which I'm going to offer and introduce into

22         evidence in conjunction with the witness's

23         testimony.

24              THE COURT: Any additional objection?

25              MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor. 2957

1              THE COURT: All right. It will be received.

2              (Exhibit No. PT 588 received.)

3     BY MR. UITERWYK:

4         Q.   This one is by Philip Morris?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And what brand is it about; do you remember?

7         A.   Yes. Philip Morris. It was--one of the

8     brands from Philip Morris was Philip Morris.

9         Q.   And what year was this ad?

10         A.   I believe this particular ad was 1950.

11          Q.   All right. And what's the subject of this

12     ad?

13         A.   Well, it's selling Philip Morris cigarettes,

14     talking about them being mild. And it talks -- asks

15     the basic question, Do you inhale?

16              And then they talk about how Philip Morris

17     brand cigarettes are easy to inhale, and they actually

18     demonstrate how to inhale the smoke on a cigarette.

19              MR. UITERWYK: Let's see that, please.

20              (Exhibit PT 588 was published to the jury.)

21               "Do you inhale? Then you're better off

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=240
22         smoking Philip Morris. And here's how you can

23         prove it. Light up a Philip Morris. Take a puff.

24         Get a good mouthful of smoke and slowly let the

25         smoke come directly through your nose. Now light 2958

1         up your present brand and do exactly the same

2         thing. Take a puff, get a good mouthful of smoke

3         and slowly let the smoke come directly through

4         your nose. Notice any difference?

5               "Yes. The Philip Morris is so mild, while my

6         own brand seems sort of harsh and burning.

7              "That's irritation. And remember, the

8         irritation you felt in your nose is the same

9         irritation that occurs in your throat every time

10         you inhale your own brand. So for a more

11          enjoyable smoke than you've ever known before,

12         smoke Philip Morris, the one cigarette proved

13         definitely less irritating, definitely milder than

14         any other leading brand.

15               "Do you inhale? Then you certainly should:

16              "Call for Philip Morris.

17               "America's finest cigarette."

18     BY MR. UITERWYK:

19         Q.   Quickly. Is that Little Johnny?

20         A.   That's Johnny Roventini, yeah.

21          Q.   All right. And he was kind of a spokesperson

22     for Philip Morris?

23         A.   Yeah. He would make appearances at movie

24     theaters as a spokesperson for Philip Morris in the

25      1940s, became a well-known personality in the '40s and 2959

1      '50s.

2         Q.   One last -- did they also have TV

3     personalities market their cigarettes, meaning the

4     defendants and other cigarette companies?

5         A.   Yes, they did.

6         Q.   Did they have the -- actually the actors or

7     cartoons or whatever market the particular brand?

8         A.   They sponsored shows and they had actors who

9     would appear in TV shows or movies, also, you know,

10     appear in the advertising for the brands during those

11      shows.

12         Q.   All right. Let's get ready to show PT 524,

13     which is the Beverly Hillbillies.

14              Are you familiar with that?

15         A.   Yes.

16         Q.   You know what? Let me skip that. We'll do

17     that tomorrow.

18              Let's go to the Flintstones.

19              MR. PHILLIPSON: PT 570.

20              MR. UITERWYK: PT 570, which I'm going to

21          offer and introduce into evidence.

22     BY MR. UITERWYK:

23         Q.   Is this an ad by Winston?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=241
24         A.   It is.

25         Q.   And when was this ad run? 2960

1         A.   1961.

2         Q.   And on what program was it run?

3         A.   Well, during the Flintstones.

4         Q.   Not everybody --

5         A.   Well, Flintstones in this period of time was

6     a prime time television show. It appeared at 7:30 in

7     the evening, became a very popular show. And it was

8     sponsored by R.J. Reynolds and, specifically, Winston

9     cigarettes. And so they did advertising around that.

10     And actually you'll see how it's built into the show.

11              When Winston pulled -- or Reynolds pulled its

12     advertising for the Flintstones when that cartoon show

13     went to Saturday morning cartoons. So they stopped

14     their sponsorship.

15         Q.   But in the meantime, they showed it at 7:30

16     at night?

17         A.   Yes.

18              MR. UITERWYK: All right. Let's look at that

19         ad, if we could.

20              THE COURT: You're moving that in? Is that

21          in?

22              MR. UITERWYK: Yes, it is --1 offered it. I

23         don't think -- what number did you say?

24              MR. PHILLIPSON: 570.

25              MR. WALKER: It's not in. This is not one 2961

1         that we discussed. We have objections under 9402

2         and 9403 and Williams.

3              THE COURT: Your objections are overruled.

4         It will be received.

5              (Exhibit No. 570 received.)

6              MR. UITERWYK: Go ahead.

7              Baron, please.

8              (Exhibit PT 570 published to the jury.)

9              "They sure work hard, don't they, Barney?

10              "Yeah. I hate to see them work so hard.

11               "Yeah, me too. Let's go around back where we

12         can't see them.

13               "Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.

14              "Okay. How's about taking a nap?

15               "I've got a better idea. Let's take a

16         Winston break.

17               "That's it. Winston is the one filter

18         cigarette that delivers flavor 20 times a pack.

19         Winston's got that filter blend.

20              "Yeah, Fred. Filter blend makes the taste

21          difference, and only Winston has it up front where

22         it counts. Here, the head of the pure white

23         filter. Winston packs rich tobacco specially

24         selected and specially processed for good flavor

25         in filter smoking.

2962

1               "Yeah, Barney, Winston tastes good like a

2         cigarette should.

3               "The Flintstones has been brought to you by

4         Winston, America's best-selling, best-tasting

5         filtered cigarette. Winston tastes good like a

6         cigarette should."

7              MR. UITERWYK: This is a good breaking point,

8         Your Honor.

9              THE COURT: All right.

10              All right. Members of the jury, we're going

11          to -- you need to leave these notebooks in your

12         chair as well as your -- this exhibit in your

13         chair as well as your notebook. And we'll be in

14         recess until tomorrow morning at nine o'clock.

15         Bear in mind again my instructions. Keep an open

16         mind. Do not do any research regarding this case.

17         Do not discuss this case by any method, manner, or

18         means with anyone or allow it to be discussed in

19         your presence.

20              Have a good night. We'll see you at

21          9:00 a.m. tomorrow. Thank you.

1       Williams. Should I somehow just communicate that

2       to you, the first -- when the first one comes up?

3       And then we'll have your ruling for kind of the

4       ones that come after that.

5            THE COURT: Yes. If you just say Williams

6       youth marketing --

7            MR WALKER: Okay.

8            THE COURT: --then I will know.

13            MR WALKER: Tab 96.

14            THE COURT: Okay. So I just make a note on

15       that. Okay.

16            All right. Bring the jury in, please.

17            (The jury returned to the courtroom at

18       9:11 a.m.)

19            THE COURT: Thank you, sir. We are ready to

20       proceed. Be seated.

21             MR. UITERWYK: May it please the Court.

22            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Counsel.

24                CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 2995

1        Q.   Good morning, Dr. Cummings.

2       A.   Good morning.

3       Q.   I believe when we broke for the day

4   yesterday, we were discussing ads as well as video ads

5   as well as ads on television programs and things of

6   that nature. And one of the -- we've not gone through

7   all the tabs in the ad notebook, which is AU 126, but

8   did the -- and we're going to be going to one of the

9   tabs now.

10            Did the cigarette companies, in addition to

11    some of the ads that we've seen, did they use holiday

12   themes in their ads advertising during this time period

13   that we've been talking about here, the forties,

14   fifties, the sixties and so forth?

15       A.   Yes. Father's Day, Christmas were commonly

16   themes you would see in advertisements.

17       Q.   All right. And the first ad we're going to

18   show is a Camel ad. Do you have any idea of the time

19   period of that, Dr. Cummings?

20       A.   This particular ad, I believe, is in the

21    forties from Camel.

22       Q.   All right. And it's Santa Claus obviously.

23   And have you seen a number of ads where the Santa Claus

24   is being used in the ads, even some with the

25   Santa Claus smoking? 2996

1        A.   Yes. This was a very common thing. They

2   would sell gift cartons that had, you know, holiday

3   wrapping on it. And all the companies did it.

4   Lorillard did it as well as R.J. Reynolds, American

5   Tobacco. It was pretty common to give cartons of

6   cigarettes as a gift back in the forties, the fifties,

7   and even in the sixties.

8       Q.   And here we've got the Kent ad for

9   Christmas --

10            MR. PEDROSA: Objection, Your Honor. Could

11        we get a date on that one?

12            THE WITNESS: This Kent ad I believe is 1965.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   All right. And how about this Kent ad?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=247
15       A.   This one right here you're showing is 1965.

16       Q.   The one up here too?

17       A.   This one with the young lady, yes.

18       Q.   How about this one?

19       A.   That's 1955.

20       Q.   And then how about this Kent ad?

21        A.   I believe this is 19 -- early 1960s.

22       Q.   And again, they advertise here the Micronite

23   filter?

24       A.   Correct.

25       Q.   All right. Now, before we go on to another 2997

1    group of ads they did -- we started -- we looked at the

2   Flintstones yesterday. And what I would like to do now

3   is get ready to show PT 524. Are you familiar with the

4   Winstons ads on the Beverly Hillbillies?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   And about what time frame was -- did that end

7   up being shown?

8       A.   Basically 1962, '63, in that era. They were

9   one of the first sponsors of that show, which became

10   basically the top viewed show on television at the

11    time.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Can we play--1 would

13       like to offer into -- introduce into evidence,

14       Your Honor, Exhibit 524.

15            MR WALKER: Objection. 402, 403 and

16       Williams.

17            THE COURT: Overruled. It will be received.

18            MRPHILIPSON: I'm going to need a second.

19            (A video clip was played for the jury as

20       follows:)

21             A SPEAKER: This here was a dandy trip. Of

22       course, we're all a might tuckered from sleeping

23       and sitting up, but Pearl's old truck run just

24       fine, and her boy --

25            (The playing of the video clip was 2998

1        interrupted.)

2            MR. UITERWYK: Woke me up this morning. I

3       didn't need my caffeine.

4            (A video clip was played for the jury as

5       follows:)

6            SPEAKER ONE: This here was a dandy trip. Of

7       course, we're all a might tuckered from sleeping

8       and sitting up, but Pearl's old truck run just

9       fine. And her boy drove all the way.

10            SPEAKER TWO: Winston?

11             SPEAKER ONE: No. Jethro. Jethro Bodine.

12       That's that big, tall, good-looking --

13            SPEAKER TWO: No, no. Mr. Clampett, I meant

14       would you like a Winston cigarette?

15            SPEAKER ONE: I don't know that I've ever

16       seen one of them before.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=248
17            SPEAKER TWO: Oh, well, try one.

18            SPEAKER ONE: Umm, mighty good-smelling

19       tobacco. What's that white stuff in there?

20            SPEAKER TWO: Oh, that's the Winston filter,

21       but it's what up front what counts.

22            SPEAKER ONE: You mean the tobacco?

23            SPEAKER TWO: Oh, the cigarette is only as

24       good as the tobacco that's in it. With Winston's

25       filter blend up front, it's like money in the 2999

1       bank. You're going to like Winstons.

2            SPEAKER ONE: I'll reckon I'll decide that

3       for myself.

4            SPEAKER TWO: Yes, sir.

5            SPEAKER ONE: I like it. This here Winston

6       tastes good.

7            SPEAKER TWO: Like a cigarette should.

8            AN ANNOUNCER: The Beverly Hillbillies has

9       been presented by Winston. We hope you enjoyed

10       it, and we hope you'll try Winston, because

11       Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.

12            (End of video clip).

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   Did Winston come up with both a soft pack and

15   flip-top box?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   And this ad was what time frame, again?

18       A.   Early sixties,'62,'63.

19       Q.   And was this a very popular program during

20   the time?

21        A.   Yes. It was the -- it became the top, you

22   know, viewed show on television.

23       Q.   Now, talking about Winston, let's look at tab

24   No. 7, if we could.

25            Can we switch over, please? 3000

1            And we've heard references to this. Winston

2   was the first to recognize that further improvement of

3   cigarette design had to come ahead of the filter in the

4   tobacco. And that's why Winston developed filter

5   blend, exclusive formula of choice, golden tobacco that

6   is specially processed for filtered smoking. Filter

7   blend is the flavor secret that makes Winston America's

8   best selling filtered cigarette.

9            Now, have you published in the area and

10   researched in the area of consumer perception of

11    filtered cigarettes specifically?

12       A.   Yes, I have.

13       Q.   And as part of your education, training,

14   experience, have you -- and as an epidemiologist in the

15   field of public health, particularly as it relates to

16   the smoking and health, have you been examining for

17   quite some time and studying and researched the matters

18   as it relates to cigarette advertising, particularly

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=249
19   filtered cigarette advertising, and the consumer's

20   perception of that advertising?

21        A.   Yes. I have done surveys. I've asked

22   consumers what they believe about the filters, whether

23   they're safer. Virtually all smokers believe they're

24   better than a nonfiltered cigarette in terms of the

25   lower risk. And I have done consumer market studies 3001

1   where you can go out and you show people a filtered

2   cigarette and a nonfiltered cigarette and then ask them

3   which one, you know, has a stronger flavor, higher tar,

4   lower tar, higher risk, easier to quit. On all

5   indications, you know, the average consumer is picking

6   out the filtered cigarette as having lower risk,

7   delivering lower tar and nicotine and being safer. And

8   that's not true.

9       Q.   And did the companies do anything to dispel

10   that perception?

11        A.   No. They did things just the opposite, to

12   promote that perception, which is why the market

13   switched from less than one percent smoking filtered

14   cigarettes in the early 1950s to today, where it's

15   close to 90 -- over 98 percent of the market is smoking

16   a filtered cigarette.

17       Q.   Was this was right at the time that Jackie

18   Loyd switched to filtered cigarettes in '54?

19       A.   Yes. She was in the early cohort that

20   switched from virtually nobody smoking a filter and by

21    the end of -- by 1964, that decade from '54 when many

22   of the filtered cigarettes were introduced -- Marlboro,

23   Winston, I think Salem came in '55 or '56 -- it had

24   gone up to 60 percent of the market. So a dramatic

25   change in smoking behavior with people going from 3002

1   unfiltered to filtered cigarettes. Most young people

2   were starting on the filtered cigarettes and then

3   starting on the -- on the Camels that they, you know,

4   started their smoking basically after the mid 1950s.

5       Q.   All right. And let's talk specifically about

6   this ad Winston ad, which is a 1958 ad, I believe.

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   And I want to -- it says, Pure white modern

9   filter to begin with, plus Winston's secret.

10            It also refers to the filter blend as well,

11    correct?

12       A.   Correct. The modern -- pure modern white

13   filter and the filter blend, what's up front that

14   counts, that was -- you heard it in the ads, the

15   television ad from the Flintstones and the Beverly

16   Hillbillies. It was communicated in the print

17   advertising. That was the theme of Winston's

18   marketing.

19       Q.   And what has your research shown, Doctor,

20   what they were trying to convey with this ad?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=250
21        A.   Well, they were trying to convey that you

22   could get a great tasting cigarette in a filter, which

23   was snowy white, which implied, just by the name

24   itself, the filtered cigarette, that you were taking

25   out certain tars and nicotine in the product, conveying 3003

1   that it was, you know, less irritating, easier on your

2   body, particularly as the health information was

3   beginning to come out more frequently in the fifties

4   and the sixties.

5            MR. UITERWYK: And, Your Honor -- I'm sorry,

6       Your Honor. Not yet.

7   BY MR. UITERWYK:

8       Q.   Did they -- while these ads were running in

9    1958 and around that time frame and they were marketing

10   and conveying Winston secret and the filter blend, were

11    representatives of the RJR company, in fact,

12   researching internally, not with any public disclosure,

13   what effect and what was really -- what that blend --

14   effect that blend had?

15       A.   Yes. I mean, R.J. Reynolds had started

16   researching the health effects of their products,

17   revealed in the scientific literature, as early as --

18   at least in terms of my documentation, 1953. In 1954,

19   they hired Allen Rodgman, a chemist, an analytic

20   chemist who produced a number of studies. And they had

21    a large research program going on within the company

22   looking at what was in the cigarette smoke and the

23   effect of different blends that were used in their

24   cigarettes.

25       Q.   All right. And what we're going to do is 3004

1   we're going to refer to -- the next document is dated

2    11/23/1956, two years before this ad, the memo from

3   Murray Senkus to Kenneth Hoover.

4            MR. UITERWYK: It's PT 4993 under tab No. 90,

5       Your Honor. We're going to offer and move into

6       evidence that document, Your Honor, in connection

7       with the witness's testimony.

8            THE COURT: Okay. Let me get to it, please.

9            THE CLERK: Was that 4993?

10            MR. UITERWYK: 4993, correct.

11             THE CLERK: Thank you.

12            THE COURT: Any objection?

13            MR WALKER: 9402 and 9403, Judge.

14            THE COURT: Your objections are overruled.

15       It will be received.

16            (Exhibit 9402 and 9403 received.)

17            MR. UITERWYK: Can we put that up on the

18       screen? Can we switch over, please?

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   Briefly, Doctor, we do have a number of

21    documents to go over too, today, and I want to try to

22   go through all of this. This is an RJR document,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=251
23   correct?

24       A.   Correct.

25       Q.   And you've seen this document before? 3005

1        A.   Yes, I have.

2       Q.   Now -- and Kenneth Hoover, to whom this

3   document was directed, was he on the board of directors

4   of RJR as well as being the director of research?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   And look at the title. This is from

7   isolation of compounds from tobacco. What does that

8   mean, Dr. Senkus --1 mean, that Dr. Senkus -- it's

9   actually Rodgman?

10       A.   This is Murray Senkus --

11        Q.   Oh?

12       A.   -- from the chemistry department. He's the

13   author of this document, written to the director of

14   research. And they're isolating -- you know, basically

15   tried to isolate the particular chemical compounds in

16   different types of tobacco, in different brands of

17   their cigarette. Camel and Winston specifically are

18   compared, because they had slightly different blends.

19   And they're looking for the amount of polycyclic

20   aromatic hydrocarbons, which is a class of chemicals

21    that you find in cigarette smoke as a result of the

22   burning process. And several of those chemicals that

23   they were beginning to isolate in their labs at that

24   time had been identified as probable carcinogens in

25   cigarette smoke. 3006

1        Q.   All right. You said a mouthful.

2       A.   Yeah.

3       Q.   And let me just break it down for two

4   seconds. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons?

5       A.   PAHs.

6       Q.   That's what I was going to ask. Is it

7   frequently referred to as PAH?

8       A.   Yes.

9       Q.   Is it a carcinogen?

10       A.   It's a class of compounds, and yes, several

11    in that class have been identified as carcinogens.

12       Q.   All right. And is a carcinogen a

13   cancer-causing type compound?

14       A.   Yes, it is.

15       Q.   Now, in that particular document on page

16   Bates stamp 7, it says, As reported previously, the

17   composition of the smoke from Winston cigarettes with

18   and without G76 --

19            What is that? A type of the tobacco?

20       A.   The G7 product was the reconstituted, manmade

21    tobacco that was being added to the blend.

22       Q.   That's the one where they take the nicotine

23   out and put it in back in?

24       A.   That's right.

25       Q.   Differs markedly from the composition of the 3007

1    smoke from Camel cigarettes or from flue cured

2   cigarettes -- we talked about that as well -- insofar

3   as the total content of the polycyclic aromatic

4   hydrocarbons is concerned.

5            Then he goes on.

6            It was found that the fat and wax content of

7   the Winston blends do not differ appreciably from the

8   Camel blends, although the polycyclic aromatic

9   hydrocarbon -- strike that -- polycyclic -- the court

10   reporter is going to love this -- polycyclic aromatic

11    hydrocarbons content of the smoke from the Winston

12   cigarette was four and a half times of that of the

13   smoke from Camel cigarettes.

14       A.   Two and a half.

15       Q.   Did I say -- two and a half times?

16       A.   It's two and a half times.

17       Q.   Sorry. Was two and a half times that of the

18   smoke from Camel cigarettes.

19            Did I read that correctly this time?

20       A.   Yes, you did.

21        Q.   All right. So did the smoke from Winston

22   have two and a half times the cancer-causing agent that

23   Camel did?

24       A.   Yeah. They're showing that the blend makes a

25   difference in terms of the exposure. And actually, 3008

1   their study here is indicating that the amount of PAHs

2   or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons identified in

3   Winston was significantly higher than their Camel

4   cigarette.

5       Q.   What is the significance of that statement as

6   it relates to that time frame and what was going on in

7   that time frame both as to advertising, as to people

8   switching to the filtered cigarettes, that they -- in

9   fact, Winston had two and a half times the cancer

10   causing agents of Camel?

11        A.   Well, the significance is that the product

12   had more carcinogens, and yet people were switching to

13   the filtered cigarettes under the perception that the

14   filtered cigarettes were safer.

15       Q.   And did that necessarily mean, Doctor, that

16   Winstons could be more lethal than Camel cigarettes?

20   BY MR. UITERWYK:

21        Q.   What does that indicate as it relates to

22   cancer-causing agents between Camels and Winston in

23   connection with the effect on smoking and the

24   absorption of these cancer-causing agents?

25       A.   Well, they both were identified to have 3009

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=253
1    cancer-causing chemicals. That was something that

2   should be noted. But there were more in Winston than

3   in Camels. So dose makes a difference. And that was

4   not communicated to the public.

5       Q.   And on the bottom, it concludes, In view of

6   the unusually large amount of polycyclic aromatic

7   hydrocarbons in the smoke of the two types of Winston

8   blend cigarettes, a reinvestigation of the composition

9   of smoke from cigarettes composed of Winston blend

10   tobacco, with 4 and without 5, G 76 was initiated.

11             Have you studied what, in fact, they did with

12   this Winston blend during this time frame? Did it make

13   any changes of any significance?

14       A.   Sure. There were changes, as I pointed out

15   yesterday. I think there were some 28 modifications

16   that I counted up between 1954 and 1983 based on some

17   internal business records that I have seen where they

18   looked at the change. So they were constantly

19   modifying the products, but they weren't -- but that

20   was internal. They weren't communicating that to

21    consumers, that they were modifying it.

22       Q.   Did it still have, based on your research,

23   the two and a half times level of PAHs than Camel did?

24       A.   I can't say that for sure, because I have

25   not --1 have seen this document. It was two and a 3010

1   half times higher when they tested it in 1956. I can't

2   say whether it was higher or lower at other times, but

3   I've just not seen that internal --

4       Q.   And we'll -- and we'll talk about some other

5   documents which refer to the tars and nicotine in a

6   minute. Now, based on your review of the records in

7   your research in this matter during this time frame,

8   had Dr. Senkus or anybody at RJR, had they communicated

9   any of this information to the public during this time

10   frame, that they had a cigarette that they were

11    marketing with a pure white filter, with a secret

12   filter blend, and that, in fact, it had two and a half

13   times the carcinogens that the previous most popular

14   cigarettes had?

15       A.   What they communicated to the public was that

16   their product was safe to use, as intended; that if

17   there were anything bad in the product, they would

18   remove it, and they hadn't identified anything bad, so

19   nothing had to be changed. That's what they

20   communicated to the American public. This information

21    was really not available until the internal business

22   records of the companies became available in the late

23    1990s, around 1999.

24       Q.   So my question was, did they tell anybody in

25   any form -- advertising, press release, notifications, 3011

1   warning labels -- during the time frame providing any

2   information with regard to the increase of

6            THE COURT: Sustained.

7   BY MR. UITERWYK:

8       Q.   Did they warn? Did they put any warning on

9   the package?

10       A.   No.

11        Q.   Now, going to tab 9 again, if we could.

12            This is a similar ad with Winston. What time

13   frame was this?

14       A.   Late fifties, early sixties, I believe.

15       Q.   And here is -- they referred again to the

16   Winston blend. Are those a reference to the same

17   thing?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   And this says nothing about because it's a

20   different blend, it's got higher carcinogens, does it?

21             MR WALKER: Objection. The document speaks

22       for itself.

23            THE COURT: I didn't hear the objection.

25            THE COURT: Sustained. 3012

1   BY MR. UITERWYK:

2       Q.   All right. Also, if we could go back to

3   tab 8 for a moment, please. We saw reference here --

4   again, you mentioned it earlier, it was the pure white

5   filter, correct?

6       A.   That's correct.

7       Q.   And --in 1958. And did they continue to

8   promote and advertise the effectiveness of their

9   filters throughout the sixties as well?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   Fifties, sixties?

12       A.   Yes. They talked about it in, you know, the

13   Flintstones ad and also the Beverly Hillbillies ad. It

14   was part of their marketing.

15       Q.   Okay. Now, did Reynolds do it at that time,

16   but did Kent cigarettes also market their Kent

17   cigarettes, Micronite filter, as being safer?

18       A.   Yes. Definitely Kent used that and it was

19   particularly noted as a product that was targeting

20   those who were health concerned.

21        Q.   And did Congress in 1958 set up a commission

22   to investigate false and misleading advertising of

23   filter tip cigarettes?

24       A.   Yes. In 1957 actually they held hearings.

25       Q.   A report was issued? 3013

1        A.   The Blatnik hearings. And they published

2   their report in 1958.

3            MR. UITERWYK: And do we have that report

4       from the Blatnik hearings, PT 4011 ?

5            And I would like to offer and introduce into

7            THE COURT: Tab number?

18            MR. UITERWYK: Switch over again, please.

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   Give us a brief background of this. What

21    happened here?

22       A.   Well, there were a lot of claims coming up in

23   advertising of filtered cigarettes in the 1950s, during

24   this period, and so there was a government hearing, a

25   congressional hearing that was held to review the 3014

1   validity of some of the claims that were being made.

2   And the summary of those hearings and the conclusions

3   from the congressional committee that had those

4   hearings was summarized in this report.

5       Q.   And let's go to Bates page 28, if we could,

6   please, Baron.

7            And this is the conclusion, is it not?

8       A.   That's correct.

9       Q.   And did they conclude as a result of these

10   hearings -- these are the Blatnik hearings -- in this

11   particular document, which is PT4011, the cigarette

12   manufacturers have deceived the American public through

13   their advertising of filter tip cigarettes. Without

14   specifically claiming that the filter tip removes the

15   agents alleged to contribute to heart disease or lung

16   cancer, the advertising has emphasized such claims as

17   clean smoking, snowy white --

18            We saw that in the Winston ad particularly,

19   didn't we?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Pure, miracle tip, 20,000 filter traps, gives

22   you more of what you changed to a filter for, and other

23   phrases implying health protection, when actually most

24   filter cigarettes produce as much or more nicotine and

25   tar as cigarettes without filters. This effectiveness 3015

1    of this deceptive advertising is evidenced by the rise

2   in filter cigarette sales from 1.4 percent of total

3   cigarette sales in 1952 to 40 percent in 1957. The

4   American public have paid premium prices of 2 to 6

5   cents per pack for filter cigarettes' protection they

6   did not receive.

7            MR WALKER: Your Honor, under the rule of

8       completeness, I request that the single sentence

9       that's not highlighted and that Mr. Uiterwyk

10       skipped over be read.

11             THE COURT: All right.

12            MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry. I didn't read the

13       yellow. I didn't notice that.

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   Ironically, on denying the alleged health

16   hazards of the cigarette smoking, the cigarette

17   industry has, in its advertising, made these charges

18   appear true.

19            An inconsistent message?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Tell us about that.

22       A.   Well, they were giving people a rationale to

23   continue to smoke. So if you were concerned about the

24   health risks of smoking, we have a product that will

25   give you the solution -- our filtered cigarettes --3016

1   which, as they indicate, would remove certain tars and

2   nicotine. That was the perception that people had, and

3   so they could continue to smoke without having

4   any worries.

5            So on one hand, even though publicly they

6   said our products are not injurious to health, we deny

7   that there is any harm associated with smoking, they

8   knew that the information was coming out, and they used

9   it in their marketing.

10            MR. UITERWYK: Bates 19, please.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   They talk specifically in this report, do

13   they not, about Reynolds Tobacco Company and, in fact,

14   Winstons?

15       A.   Yes. Because it had became the leading

16   filtered cigarette at the time.

17       Q.   And Reynolds Tobacco introduced their

18   filter -- Winston filter tip in 1955, which filters so

19   effectively, tested at 3.1 milligrams of nicotine and

20   20 milligrams of tar. By 1957, with an exclusive

21    filter, snowy white and pure, tests on Winston improved

22   to 3.8 milligrams of nicotine and 22 milligrams of the

23   tar.

24            Did I read that correctly?

25       A.   Yes. The tar and nicotine levels went up 3017

1   because they loosened the filter fibers, so making the

2   filter less efficient.

3       Q.   And is that one of the design and engineering

4   manipulations that we talked about?

5            MR WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Design

9       Q.   In order to -- in connection with these

10   advertisements and in order to affect the smoker's

11   behavior, did they do that manipulation of the

12   cigarette, as we talked about, in the design and

13   engineering of a cigarette, in order to affect what the

14   smoker gets in their smoke?

15       A.   Yes, they did.

16       Q.   And by doing that, did they cause a smoker to

17   take in more tar?

18       A.   Yes. I mean, they -- by loosening the filter

19   fibers, it would make the filter less efficient, reduce

20   resistance to draw, so the person would take a bigger,

21    deeper puff, taking more of the particles into their

22   mouth and airways.

23       Q.   And tar is what contains the carcinogens?

24       A.   Correct.

25       Q.   And did it also allow them to bring in more 3018

1   nicotine?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   All right. And would that cause a greater

4   addiction?

8       Q.   Go ahead.

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   All right. Now, I'm not going to go through

11    and -- try to skip -- let's go quickly to page 18 for a

12   minute. Page 18. Now, if you would blow up that box

13   right there for a minute.

14            You've seen this document, have you not?

15       A.   I have.

16       Q.   And you've provided, I believe, the figures.

17   It talks about regular no filter versus king with

18   filter, does it not?

19       A.   Correct.

20       Q.   And it compares the levels of tar for regular

21    filters in the 1957 time frame -- regular cigarettes

22   without filters, versus filters, cigarettes with

23   filters. And does it compare the -- Winston they

24   talked a minute ago about 22 milligrams of tar. And

25   did they, in fact, do an average there -- did you do an 3019

1    average to show how many milligrams of tar is in the

2   nonfilter?

3       A.   Correct.

4       Q.   What is it?

5       A.   It's basically 17.

6       Q.   So the filtered cigarette has 25 percent more

7   tar -- strike that.

8            Yes. The filtered cigarette had 25 more tar

9   than a nonfilter?

10       A.   Correct.

11        Q.   And then did the -- did they give the numbers

12   for the -- for the nicotine? And they talked earlier

13   about, I believe, 3.8 milligrams per cigarette for the

14   Winston cigarettes?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   And was the nicotine for the nonfiltered --

17   what was that number that that averaged at?

18       A.   Well, if you look at the averages here, you

19   know, November of '57 is about 2.4.

20       Q.   So Winston cigarettes had basically 50

21   percent more than the nicotine in the nonfilters?

25            MR. UITERWYK: What -3020

1            THE COURT: Sustained as to leading.

2   BY MR. UITERWYK:

3       Q.   What was the difference in levels between the

4   nonfilters, like Camel, and the Winston filters,

5   cigarettes, as far as the level of nicotine is

6   concerned?

7       A.   Essentially, the unfiltered cigarettes had

8   less tar and nicotine, and the level of relative

9   difference is around 50 percent.

10       Q.   All right. So when Jackie started smoking or

11    switched from nonfilters to filters, she got 25 percent

12   more tar when she switched to Winston, did she not?

13       A.   Ms. Loyd did, yes.

14       Q.   Thank you. You helped me there. Thanks.

15            And when Ms. Loyd switched from nonfilters to

16   Winston filters, did she get 50 percent more nicotine?

17       A.   We don't know. These are machine measures.

18   So just to be, you know, straight here, these are

19   machine measured. But the machine standardized yields

20   were higher for the filtered cigarettes, the Winston

21    cigarettes, than they were for many of the unfiltered

22   cigarettes, including Camel cigarettes, on the market.

23   And that's certainly not what the perception was among

24   the smokers.

25       Q.   That was actually going to be my next 3021

1   question, so skip that one.

2            Based on your review of the records, what

3   they were doing with these cigarettes, what they were

4   doing with these filters and the way they were

5   marketing these filters, do you have an opinion as to

6   whether or not this was intentional?

7       A.   Oh, it was quite intentional. It was by --1

8   mean, these were engineering decisions that were built

9   in. When the -- when the Winston filter first came

10   out, it was more efficient. They loosened it because

11   by allowing more tar particles it gives you more taste

12   and it gives you more nicotine.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=259
13            They also changed the blend. And one of the

14   reasons you get different yields, with different blends

15   of tobacco. And they used the filter blend because it

16   had a little stronger taste. So they were going to

17   give you a good tasting cigarette in a filter, a

18   variety. That was -- that was the marketing claim. It

19   wasn't only R.J. Reynolds, but certainly R.J. Reynolds

20   did that.

21        Q.   And in your opinion, Doctor, did this play a

22   substantial part in her addiction to switching to a

23   higher nicotine filter, a higher nicotine cigarette?

24            MR WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Calls for

25       speculation, and it's an opinion that's not 3022

1        disclosed.

2            THE COURT: Sustained.

3   BY MR. UITERWYK:

4       Q.   Doctor, when people did switch from the

5   nonfilters to these filters during this time frame as a

6   result of advertising, as a result of the perceptions

7   that they had, did it affect the strength of their

8   addiction and the amount of nicotine that they took in?

9       A.   Sure. It would maintain their addiction.

10   And actually the filter, because of the way it was

11    engineered, to allow for deeper inhalation with smaller

12   particles, facilitated the exposure to not only the

13   carcinogens in the product and other toxins but also

14   nicotine. Rapid delivery of nicotine into the lungs

15   facilitated addiction and would maintain addiction in

16   somebody who was hooked.

17       Q.   All right. Let's look at the next

18   document -- sorry. Strike that.

19            Page 19 on this document. We already looked

20   at that. Let me go on. I believe we've looked at --

21    strike that.

22            Are you familiar with the document, a memo

23   from an M.G. Kramer, president and CEO of -- to him

24   from Yellen in 1964?

25       A.   Yes. Mr. Yellen was the director of sales 3023

1   for -- at the time for Lorillard, and Mr. Kramer was

2   the president of Lorillard Tobacco. And this is a memo

3   from September of 1964.

4            MR. UITERWYK: And, Your Honor, I'm offering

5       and introducing into evidence PT 2073, which is

6       the memo that we just described.

7            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, objection. 403,

8       402, Williams, remoteness in time.

9            THE COURT: Those objections are overruled.

10       It will be received.

11             MR WALKER: My objection is to hearsay and

12       reliance.

13            THE COURT: That objection is overruled.

14            (Exhibit PT 2703 received.)

15            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Can we see PT

16       2703.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   Tell the jury what that is about, please.

19       A.   Well, basically talking about their sales

20   position at the time for Lorillard and commenting on

21    Kent cigarettes. And the timing of this is

22   particularly relevant, because Kent was marketing

23   largely as a health cigarette with its Micronite

24   filter. And this comes right after the 1964 Surgeon

25   General's report, which had come out in January of that 3024

1   year. Of course, that made people more aware that

2   there were health risks, and so the marketing claims

3   were, you know, around health cigarettes or presumed

4   health cigarettes, they were looking at how they had

5   fared with regards to that and how they were planning

6   to move their marketing strategies going forward.

7       Q.   And did they, in fact, admit there -- as all

8   of us are aware, Kent was marketed as a safer cigarette

9   for the smoker who was concerned about smoking and

10   health.

11        A.   Correct.

12       Q.   And was Kent a safer cigarette for those who

13   were concerned about smoking and health?

14       A.   No, it was not a safer cigarette.

15       Q.   And we looked at yesterday, I believe --

16            If we could switch over to here, please.

17            We looked at this Kent ad in 19 -- 1954,

18   which cigarette gives you the greatest -- or health

19   protection, correct?

20       A.   Correct.

21        Q.   And they actually did -- told about a study

22   and how you could do it and compare and see it.

23       A.   Correct.

24            MR WALKER: Can we have a date of that last?

25            MR. UITERWYK: I said it. 3025

1            MR WALKER: Did you?

2            MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

3            MR. WALKER: I missed it. I'm sorry.

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   And did cigarette smokers like Jackie Loyd

6   respond to that advertising and smoke Kent cigarettes?

7       A.   She did. The testimony I reviewed indicates

8   she went --

9            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Speculation and

10       hearsay, Your Honor.

11             THE COURT: Sustained.

12            MR. PEDROSA: Also nonresponsive.

13            THE COURT: Well, sustained. Put another

14       question to him, please.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   All right. In connection with determining

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=261
17   what people do and their perception and how they react

18   to ads like this and misleading advertising like this

19   and how they react to it, do you actually look at what

20   their response is, what their brand usage is?

21        A.   Yeah. Brand history tells you a lot about

22   how they responded to the marketing.

23       Q.   And did you do that in this case?

24       A.   Yes, I did.

25       Q.   And is that something -- in your type of 3026

1    expertise as an epidemiologist and expert in the field

2   of public safety, particularly as it relates to the

3   smoking and health, is that something that's frequently

4   done in order to determine what effect, if any, these

5   ads have on a smoker?

6       A.   Yes. It's not only, based on my research,

7   evident in the business records where they look at

8   brand switching, but I have done my own studies to look

9   at smokers and their brand switching behaviors and how

10   that relates to various factors, including perceptions

11    about health risks, as well as things like price, which

12   also is a factor in brand switching.

13       Q.   And in this case, did you also review the

14   materials that were provided to you in depositions in

15   order to determine what brands they -- what brands

16   Jackie Loyd was using at various times in her life?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   And I believe we've discussed that she

19   switched to Kent at some time in the eighties, correct?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   And based on -- in your opinion, was she

22   responding to this ad -- these ads?

23            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Calls for

24       speculation.

25            THE COURT: Sustained. 3027

1   BY MR. UITERWYK:

2       Q.   All right. Do you have an opinion as to what

3   effect, if any, these ads had on Jackie Loyd?

4            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Calls for

5       speculation.

6            THE COURT: I haven't heard the answer yet.

7            THE WITNESS: In my opinion, yes.

8            THE COURT: Okay. Next question.

9            MR. UITERWYK: All right.

10            MR WALKER: Move to strike, Your Honor.

11             THE COURT: The question--overruled. The

12       question was, Does he have an opinion? The

13       opinion is yes. Next question.

14            MR. UITERWYK: Okay, Your Honor.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   What is that opinion, Doctor?

17            MR. PEDROSA: Objection.

18            THE COURT: You are going to have to rise

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=262
19       when you make an objection, because I can't hear

20       you. And you're certainly capable of making your

21        voice louder. So, please.

22            MR. PEDROSA: I will do that, Your Honor.

23       I'm trying not to be --

24            THE COURT: That's okay. But I can't hear

25       you. You're in the corner there, and for some 3028

1        reason, I can hear Mr. Walker perfectly fine.

2            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Calls for

3       speculation.

4            THE COURT: Sustained.

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   All right. Now, did -- in addition to

7   smoking nonfilters, including Camels, in the early

8   fifties and the Winstons in '54, and the fifties and

9   sixties and seventies and eighties partly and then --

10   did she also smoke True at some point in time?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   And I want you to look at an ad from True,

13   which is tab No. 11.

14            Switch over, please. Oh, I am on it.

15   Thanks.

16            And do you know what the date on that ad is?

17       A.   1976.

18       Q.   And considering all I heard, I decided to

19   either quit or smoke True. And then it goes on: I

20   smoke True.

21             Ads like this and as a person with an

22   expertise in addiction and smoking cessation, does this

23   affect your practice in that area?

24            MR WALKER: If I might, Your Honor,

25       Mr. Uiterwyk read only a portion of this document. 3029

1        Under the rule of completeness, I would ask that

2       the entire ad be shown and that the warning

3       language in the bottom left corner be read.

4            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, we're -

5            THE COURT: Go ahead. Sustained. You can

6       read it.

7            MR. UITERWYK: We're going to see it on the

8       board more times.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Warning: Surgeon General has -- the Surgeon

11    General has determined that cigarette smoking is

12   dangerous to your health. Correct?

13       A.   Yes. That was the warning at that time.

14       Q.   How does that warning then -- how does what

15   they say here compare -- what does it do to the

16   warning, these here, in little bitty type, and then

17   we've got this big type over here on the top right?

18            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Argumentative, and

19       the document speaks for itself.

20            THE COURT: Okay. Sustained.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=263
21    BY MR. UITERWYK:

22       Q.   How does -- how does it affect the perception

23   of persons who review it and who are addicted to

24   cigarettes containing nicotine?

25            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Calls for 3030

1        speculation.

2            THE COURT: Overruled.

3            THE WITNESS: Basically, people notice the

4       imagery and larger type. If you do eye tracking

5       studies, which I have done, where you can look at

6       where people focus on an ad and how long they

7       actually -- what they read and can interpret,

8       based on time of reading the ads, people hardly

9       notice the small type and warnings and they tend

10       to focus on the larger type. And this ad gives

11        you an excuse to keep smoking. That's what it's

12       about.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   Now, Doctor, what is the Federal Trade

15   Commission?

16       A.   The Federal Trade Commission is a

17   government --U.S. government agency that is charged

18   with regulating trade.

19       Q.   And in connection with that, did the Federal

20   Trade Commission examine and do a report in connection

21    with the impact that advertising by the cigarette

22   companies was having on the American public?

23       A.   Yes. They were required, as a result of

24   Congress, to put out reports on cigarette advertising

25   and the effect of cigarette advertising on the public, 3031

1   beginning in the late 1960s.  1967 was their first

2   report.

3       Q.   All right. And I would like to -- let me

4   look at my number. Yes. 38. Tab 93, 3870, which is

5   FTC report on false and misleading advertising, dated

6   6/30/1967.

7            Are you familiar with that document?

8       A.   Not that title. The one for 1967 says

9   Federal Trade Commission report to Congress pursuant to

10   the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act,

11    June 30, 1967.

12            MR. UITERWYK: All right. In connection with

13       the witness's testimony, with that correction he

14       made, I would like to offer and introduce into

15       evidence 3870.

16            THE COURT: What tab, sir?

17            MR. UITERWYK: Tab No. 93.

18            THE COURT: All right. Let me take a look at

19       it briefly. Objections?

20            MR WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. This document

21        contains hearsay opinions that do not meet the

22       requirements under 90.702, and it's improper

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=264
23       bolstering.

24            THE COURT: Specifically refer me to a page.

25            MR WALKER: I don't know which page he 3032

1        intends to show, but --

2            THE COURT: You said this report has hearsay

3       that doesn't meet 702?

4            MR WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

5            THE COURT: Okay. Can you point to it?

6       What's the basis of that objection?

7            MR WALKER: For example, page 4 is filled

8       with hearsay opinions.

9            THE COURT: Okay. Let me -

10            MR WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

11             THE COURT: Let me take a look.

12            MR WALKER: Page 7, page 8.

13            THE COURT: All right. Will counsel

14       approach, please.

15            (At the bench.)

16            THE COURT: Response, Mr. Uiterwyk?

17            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, it's a public

18       records exception, No. 1. Number 2, it's also an

19       ancient document.

20            THE COURT: It's a what, sir?

21             MR. UITERWYK: Ancient document.

22            THE COURT: Okay. What does that mean

23       with -- how is that relevant with respect to the

24       alleged hearsay statements within the report?

25            MR. UITERWYK: That's an exception to the 3033

1        hearsay rule.

2            THE COURT: An ancient document is?

3            MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

4            THE COURT: This is hearsay within the

5       hearsay, I guess. The hearsay statement -- the

6       report itself is hearsay. And the public records

7       exception would -- I'm ruling that that would take

8       it out of the hearsay. But there is hearsay

9       contained in the report itself, which was

10       Mr. Walker's objection.

11             MR. UITERWYK: I'm not sure which question

12       he's talking about.

13            THE COURT: Well, in the report -

14       specifically page 7, at the bottom of the page,

15       there is a quote from the --

16            MR. UITERWYK: Oh. I'm not going to read

17       that, Your Honor.

18            THE COURT: I know, but you're moving the

19       document in evidence.

20            MR. UITERWYK: I will delete that.

21             THE COURT: Okay.

22            MR WALKER: It doesn't address the 702

23       opinion testimony, Your Honor, that this contains,

24       nor does it address the bolstering issue.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=265
25           And I might add, we do have preemption 3034

1        objections to this document. It's an express

2       attack on warning labels. But I know those were

3       addressed pretrial.

4            THE COURT: Okay.

5            MR WALKER: But in particular, there are

6       statements -- for example, on page 4, there is

7       virtually no evidence --

8            THE COURT: Let me find what you're referring

9       to.

10            MR WALKER: It's the fifth paragraph. Byway

11        of example, on page 4, it's making an opinion or a

12       conclusion, if you will, that requires expertise

13       as to which it's not been established and cannot

14       be established for this document. This document

15       was written by lawyers, not by people who have the

16       qualifications to assess the effectiveness of the

17       warnings.

18            The same is true for page 7 that says the

19       warning statement on the package alone has proved

20       to be ineffective, mainly because few people seem

21        to pay attention to it.

22            That is opinion evidence for which there is

23       no 702 predicate.

24            THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to overrule the

25       objections. 3035

1             (In open court)

2            MR. UITERWYK: For the record, Your Honor,

3       I'm offering Exhibit No. 3870.

4            THE COURT: All right. It will be received

5       over defense counsels' objections.

6            (Exhibit 3870 received.)

7            MR. UITERWYK: Can we go to that document,

8       please, Baron?

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   And in particular, I want to go to Bates --

11             This is the report from the Federal Trade

12   Commission pursuant to the Federal Cigarette Labeling

13   and Advertising Act of June 30th, 1967?

14       A.   Correct. It's the first report issued --

15       Q.   Right.

16       A.   --by the FTC on cigarette advertising.

17       Q.   Let's go to Bates 16. Since I have not done

18   a-

19            Why don't you just read that for us,

20   Dr. Cummings?

21        A.   Sure. It says cigarette advertising reaches

22   virtually all Americans who can either read or

23   understand the spoken word. Cigarettes are advertised

24   on both network and spot television, on radio, in

25   magazines, and newspapers and outdoor media and by 3036

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=266
1   means of many types of point-of-sale advertising aids.

2   So pervasive is cigarette advertising that it is

3   virtually impossible for Americans of almost any age to

4   avoid cigarette advertising.

5       Q.   And then we go on.

6            If we could, Baron. No, not on that. Page

7   32.

8            Did they also, in addition to looking at

9   advertising, did they look at the effect of advertising

10   as it relates to the warning labels?

11        A.   Yes. The first caution label had come out in

12    1966, and they -- the FTC commission believes that the

13   warning label on cigarette packs -- packages has not

14   succeeded in overcoming the prevalent attitude toward

15   cigarette smoking created and maintained by the

16   cigarette companies through their advertisements,

17   particularly the barrage of commercials on television,

18   which portray smoking as a harmless and enjoyable

19   social activity that is not habit forming and involves

20   no hazards to health.

21        Q.   Go ahead, please.

22       A.   Many smokers would like to give up the habit,

23   but don't and won't. Some of these have switched to

24   brands that they believe, often erroneously, to be less

25   hazardous. The commission favors giving smokers as 3037

1   much information about the risks involved in smoking as

2   is possible, and to that end favors mandatory

3   disclosure of tar and nicotine content as measured by a

4   standardized test.

5       Q.   All right. And then -- before we get to that

6   paragraph --no. Let's go ahead to page 33.

7            Let me -- in fact, is that an accurate

8   statement of what -- based on your research, of what

9   was going on?

10       A.   Yes. The statements that I just read?

11        Q.   Yeah.

12       A.   Absolutely.

13       Q.   All right. And let's go ahead to the next

14   page, Bates 33.

15       A.   Would you like me to read this?

16       Q.   Please.

17       A.   Cigarette commercials continue to appeal to

18   youth and continue to blot out any consciousness of the

19   health hazards. Cigarette advertisements continue to

20   appear on programs watched and heard repeatedly by

21    millions of teenagers. Today, teenagers are constantly

22   exposed to an endless barrage of subtle messages that

23   cigarette smoking increases popularity, makes one more

24   masculine or attractive to the opposite sex, enhances

25   one's social poise, etc. 3038

1            To allow the American people, and especially

2   teenagers, the opportunity to make an informed and

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=267
3   deliberate choice of whether or not to start smoking,

4   they must be freed from constant exposure to such

5   one-sided blandishments and told the whole story.

6       Q.   Is this what you were talking about before

7   when you mentioned information is so important?

8            MR WALKER: Objection, leading.

9            MR. UITERWYK: It's a preliminary question.

10            THE COURT: Yeah. Overruled.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   Dr. Cummings?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   And what they are saying about the

15   information, what effect did it have on the behavior of

16   smokers, including Jackie Loyd, during that time frame

17   of the fifties and the sixties and thereafter?

18            MR WALKER: Objection. Improper bolstering.

19            THE COURT: Overruled.

20            THE WITNESS: They're basically saying the

21        information people are getting exposed to tends to

22       be one-sided, and people need to get the full

23       story, and that has an effect on people's

24       decisions that they make with regards to their use

25       of cigarettes. 3039

1   BY MR. UITERWYK:

2       Q.   And were these type of advertisements and

3   this type of exposure and one-sided blandishments and

4   being shown to teenagers, subtle messages, the barrage

5   of subtle messages, in your opinion, was that being

6   done also in the early fifties during the time period

7   that Jackie Loyd started to smoke in 1951?

8       A.   Yes. It was being done in the fifties; the

9   forties, the fifties, the sixties, and continued. The

10   amount of cigarette advertising was massive relative to

11    the amount of information coming out to educate the

12   American public about the dangers of smoking, although

13   more information did begin to come out following the

14   Surgeon General's report and has continued.

15       Q.   All right. And we'll talk about that a

16   little later, Doctor. But let's go now to 3165, PT

17   3165, another FTC report on cigarette advertising dated

18   May 1st, 1981.

19            Are you familiar with that document?

20       A.   lam.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, in connection with

22       the witness's testimony, I would like to offer

23       into evidence PT 3165.

24            THE COURT: Tab number, sir?

25            MR. UITERWYK: Tab 94. 3040

1            THE COURT: Let me take a look, please.

2       Objections?

3            MR WALKER: 401, 402, 403, 801, 802, 702 and

4       improper bolstering, and preemption.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=268
5            THE COURT: All right. Your objections are

6       overruled. It will be received.

7            (Exhibit PT 3165 received.)

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   If we can put up 3165, please.

10            And that's the 1981 Surgeon General -- no --

11    the FTC report on cigarette advertising investigation?

12       A.   Correct.

13       Q.   1981, May?

14       A.   Yes.

15       Q.   And on PT 95--Bates 95, please, on PT 3165.

16   And they conclude in that report that cigarettes are

17   the most heavily advertised product in America.

18            Did your research indicate that as well?

19       A.   Yes. It was the most heavily advertised

20   consumer product.

21        Q.   The National Commission on Smoking and Public

22   Policy reported in 1978 that the tobacco industry spent

23   more on advertising cigarettes in one day than the then

24   National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health, the

25   government's primary agency working in this area, spent 3041

1   in one year.

2            Did I read that correctly?

3       A.   You did.

4       Q.   Cigarette advertising expenditures have grown

5   substantially over the last decade and continue to

6   grow.

7            Now, advertising at one time -- and they

8   changed the rules as far as advertising is concerned,

9   did they not?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   Tell the jury about when they changed the

12   rules.

13       A.   Well, in 1972 -- or, excuse me, 1971,

14   cigarette advertising went off of television and radio.

15   So there was a ban on broadcast advertising. So it was

16    1971 when that went into effect. I believe the law was

17   passed in 1969.

18       Q.   Did they quit advertising totally?

19       A.   Did they quit advertising? No. They shifted

20   their advertising from broadcast into print and other

21    forms of advertising. In 19 -- in the late 1970s, half

22   of all billboards in the United States were cigarette

23   ads.

24       Q.   And then at some point, that changed as well?

25       A.   Yes. I mean, that has changed. More 3042

1   recently, in 1998, there was an agreement between state

2   attorney generals and the tobacco companies to limit,

3   you know, certain forms of advertising, print and

4   billboard advertising.

5       Q.   Do they still do what's called point-of-sale

6   advertising?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=269
7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   And tell the jury what they do in that

9   regard.

10       A.   Well, they basically -- point-of-sale

11    advertising includes the kinds of advertising you'll

12   see in a store if they're selling tobacco products. It

13   includes what we refer to as the power wall, that is

14   behind the counter. Depending on which companies are

15   spending the most money, they rent that space, they pay

16   for this space, and they dictate everything that's in

17   the store. So that's very highly controlled. And they

18   will offer incentives to the store to basically push

19   the product out the door through price incentives and

20   such.

21        Q.   Now, how does this -- well, first of all, in

22   your experience with smokers over the years and having

23   counseled tens of thousands of them and the research

24   you've done on advertising as it relates to smoking,

25   how commonplace is it for an addicted smoker to 3043

1    affirmatively state, yes, I was influenced by that

2   advertising?

3       A.   Uncommon. I think most people don't think

4   they are influenced by advertising. But we all buy

5   things. And the brand labels make a difference, and

6   the brand is a key feature of what advertising is

7   supposed to do, is to get you to buy a particular

8   product. That's what the goal of the advertiser is all

9   about.

10       Q.   How do we know whether or not it affected the

11    addicted smoker, this advertising, in particular Jackie

12   Loyd based on your review of the records and based on

13   your expertise in the field of advertising and smoking

14   behavior as it relates to public health?

15            MR WALKER: Objection. Calls for speculation

16       as to Ms. Loyd.

17            THE COURT: Overruled as to this question.

18            THE WITNESS: A simple test. You look at

19       what brand the person is smoking. So in the

20       industry, you look at trial, trying product,

21        trying a brand, and then adoption, which is

22       adoption of that brand on a regular basis 30 days

23       after the initial trial.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   What effect does advertising have on smoking, 3044

1    cigarette advertising like this, have on people? What

2   type of effect?

3       A.   The effect of cigarette advertising is you

4   get people to buy particular brands of cigarettes. So

5   it's -- the effect is measured by the market share for

6   particular brands of cigarettes. And you're either

7   building that share by getting new smokers coming into

8   the market to adopt your brand -- and brand loyalties

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=270
9   are usually established at a relatively young age --

10   and then competition to get the people to switch to

11    your brand of cigarettes or to hold them in your brand,

12   to maintain brand loyalty. That's essentially what the

13   goal of advertising is for all consumer products, and

14   it's really no different for cigarettes.

15       Q.   Have you ever heard of the term "wallpaper

16   effect" as it relates to advertising?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   Can you tell the jury your understanding of

19   the term "wallpaper effect" and how that would apply to

20   the advertising that we've been discussing --

21        A.   Well-

22       Q.   --in the last few hours?

23       A.   Sure. The wallpaper effect of cigarette

24   advertising or of any advertising is that you're

25   exposed to it and -- so you can't escape it. So it's 3045

1   literally wallpaper that you -- becomes a part of your

2   regular, normal activity of seeing the advertising.

3   And certainly cigarette advertising fits into that

4   category, because they have spent many billions of

5   dollars on an annual basis advertising, between 1940

6   and 2005, $250 billion in cigarette advertising.

7            MR WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, as to the

8       financial information. Move to strike.

9            THE COURT: Overruled.

10   BY MR. UITERWYK:

11        Q.   Go ahead. Were you done?

12       A.   Well, that was, as indicated, all forms of

13   advertising from radio, television, billboards,

14   point-of-sale, you know, promotions that were done,

15   product placements. You saw some in the comics. That

16   was also done in movies, radio shows. And then into

17   the seventies, eighties and nineties, into sports

18   sponsorships, like Winston, NASCAR racing and so on.

19       Q.   Doctor, have you in your researching the

20   company's documents and reviewing other evidence in

21    these type of cases, have you determined whether or not

22   the cigarette companies intended for people who are an

23   addicted smoker like Jackie Loyd to rely on their

24   advertising?

25       A.   Yes. 3046

1        Q.   And are you aware of a deposition that was

2   done of a head of one of those companies?

3       A.   Yeah. Robert Heimann, who was the president

4   of American Tobacco in the, you know, sixties and the

5   seventies was -- did a deposition under oath. And he

6   was asked questions about the expectations of his

7   company in terms of what people would rely on in

8   regards to advertising.

9       Q.   And this was a company that's owned by

10   R.J.Reynolds?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=271
11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   And is he going to be talking about what

13   we're going to be seeing in a minute, reliance as it

14   relates to advertising?

15       A.   Yes.

16            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Your Honor, I

17       would like to offer and introduce into evidence RH

18       001.

19            MR WALKER: I need more than five words on

20       this, Judge.

21             THE COURT: Okay. Approach.

22            (At the bench)

23            MR WALKER: Judge, what Mr. Uiterwyk is

24       proposing to do is highly improper. This is a

25       deposition that was taken of this gentleman that 3047

1        he just referred to. And there were deadlines in

2       this case by which the parties had to disclose to

3       each other what their designations were going to

4       be from depositions, any depositions, that they

5       wanted to play. There was a deadline after that

6       by which the defendants would have an opportunity

7       to submit their objections and counterdesignations

8       to that, and a deadline after at which they could

9       respond to that, those submissions.

10            None of that was done for this deposition

11        that he wants to play. We have objections. We

12       don't even know what their designations are. We

13       don't know what they intend to play. And the

14       deadline has passed for this. This is not an

15       appropriate way to deal with designations.

16            Your Honor has been ruling on, reviewing

17       deposition designations for all the depositions

18       that they intended to play except this one. It's

19       inappropriate, and it's untimely, and we object to

20       it being played in this manner.

21             MR. UITERWYK: This objection is

22       disingenuous, and it really -- this is not what

23       the intent of the designation was. The intent of

24       the designation was if we were going to call

25       witnesses. 3048

1            What we have here is an admission of a

2       corporate person that we're showing to the jury in

3       connection with his testimony. They know exactly

4       what part we're playing. They've --

5            THE COURT: Is it on your -- is it -- was it

6       furnished on your exhibit list?

7            MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

8            MR WALKER: Judge, you've just been going

9       over the deposition designations of corporate

10       representatives of Lorillard.

11             THE COURT: Well, I know. But this is a

12       little bit different. I'm not making a ruling

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=272
13       yet, but it is an exhibit --1 mean, he's not --

14       he's --

15            You're only using a portion of this

16       deposition?

17            MR. UITERWYK: Literally, ten seconds of it.

18            MR WALKER: Your Honor, it's no different.

19       The fact that he stamps "exhibit" on it doesn't

20       change the fact that it is a deposition

21        designation. There was a deadline for this.

22       Mr. Uiterwyk cannot deny that there was a deadline

23       by which deposition designations were to be

24       submitted. They didn't submit them. There is a

25       process for deposition designations, and they are 3049

1        not following it. We're being blind-sided by

2       this.

3            (In open court)

4            THE COURT: Let's --1 need to take up

5       something with the lawyers. It's going to take a

6       little more time. We're approaching the mid

7       morning break. So let's take a 20-minute break,

8       and I can deal with it.

9            Keep an open mind. Do not discuss the case.

10       We will be in recess for 20 minutes.

11             (The jury retired from the courtroom at

12        10:21 a.m.)

13            (The witness retired from the stand.)

14            (The witness exited the courtroom.)

15            THE COURT: What exhibit number are we

16       talking about?

17            MR. UITERWYK: PT 1591.

18            MRPHILIPSON:  1691?

19            MR. UITERWYK: 91.

20            MR. PHILIPSON:  1691.

21             MR. UITERWYK:  1691. Your Honor, I got a

22       transcript of what is going to be shown.

23            MR WALKER: Your Honor, under Mr. Uiterwyk's

24       theory, you didn't need to review Jack Smith,

25       Dr. Feingold, Kirsty Robinson -- sorry, Judge --3050

1        Kristy Leung, Ed Robinson, none of those. The

2       plaintiff should have just put that on their

3       exhibit list, and then you'd never have to hear

4       objections to deposition designations.

5            There is no basis under any rule of evidence

6       for which a party can simply bypass Your Honor's

7       scheduling order that sets up a way for us to be

8       protected, for Your Honor to be protected, so that

9       whatever objections there are to whatever they're

10       going to designate can be addressed in a timely

11        and proper fashion. Your Honor said a few days

12       ago that you were not going to tolerate

13       defiance -- not defiance, but a failure to follow

14       the procedure that Your Honor established.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=273
15            That's what this is. You can't just put a

16       deposition on your exhibit list and expect to play

17       deposition designations when you didn't designate

18       the testimony. Those designations were due months

19       ago.

20            And Dr. Heimann's testimony is often played

21        in these cases, but when it's properly designated

22       and we've had arguments in those cases about

23       what's going to be played, what can't be played,

24       and what the counterdesignations are.

25            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'm not sure which 3051

1        cases he's talking about, but any case I'm aware

2       of, this is exactly the way it's been offered.

3       What they're talking about is when the entire

4       deposition has been played. I'm not even aware

5       that it's done in that particular case. This is

6       the method --

7            THE COURT: Well --

8            MR. UITERWYK: -- that's been done in dozens

9       of trials.

10            MR WALKER: Mr. Uiterwyk has tried --

11             THE COURT: All right--all right. Just a

12       minute. One person at a time.

13            Mr. Walker -- you can be seated.

14            Mr. Walker's argument is, as I understand it,

15       regardless of whether you have -- you play one

16       line or 100 lines, you're still designating a part

17       of the deposition to be read into evidence. And

18       you haven't designated that according to various

19       orders that govern the procedures in this case.

20       And so that he may have -- he may have other

21        objections or may want to offer other parts of the

22       deposition, and he wasn't put on notice of your

23       designation of whatever lines you intend to show

24       to the jury.

25            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor -3052

1            THE COURT: How is that --1 mean, why isn't

2       that a valid argument, I guess.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Two reasons.

4            THE COURT: Okay.

5            MR. UITERWYK: The first is, the purpose of

6       that rule is when depositions are taken for use at

7       trial. We all know that. Every deposition that

8       we have in this case and that we've been talking

9       about designations, every one of the depositions

10       he's talked about were depositions that were taken

11        of witnesses in this particular trial.

12            This is a deposition that occurred many, many

13       years ago of the president of one of their

14       companies. And it's -- it was taken in connection

15       with another matter, with another case. And he

16       was -- it was taken as he was the corporate

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=274
17       representative in that designation, and he made

18       certain admissions.

19            And as we all know that under Rule 1.330, we

20       can use that deposition, when it's a corporate

21        officer and he makes admissions, for any purposes.

22       I don't think the intent nor the purpose nor the

23       design of the rule, or the guidelines that you had

24       or the order that you had in connection with the

25       designation of depositions contemplated this in 3053

1        the -- in the slightest. This is not the intent

2       of that rule.

3            The intent of that rule was we did

4       designations to save time in the court and, No. 1,

5       on depositions of people who are witnesses in the

6       case and whose depositions were taken in regard to

7       that case.

8            MR WALKER: Your Honor, if the testimony is

9       presented, Dr. Heimann will be a witness in this

10       case. And every argument that Mr. Uiterwyk made

11        applies to Dr. Burns. He wasn't deposed in this

12       case either. Dr. Henningfield was not deposed in

13       this case either. The deposition testimony they

14       want to play from the Lorillard corporate

15       representatives was not taken in this case.

16            None of those arguments have anything to do

17       with anything. Your Honor's order was entered,

18       signed by you on October 18th, 2012. And that

19       order, it's an agreed amended scheduling order,

20       set forth that the parties were to exchange

21        deposition designations of witnesses whose

22       testimony is expected to be presented by

23       deposition, either by transcript or video, on

24       December 18th, 2012.

25            MR. UITERWYK: This actually -3054

1            MR WALKER: And, Your Honor, I don't know why

2       he's saying Dr. Heimann is not a witness. He's

3       listed on their witness list as a witness who will

4       be testifying by deposition, which is exactly what

5       Your Honor's scheduling order went to.

6            MR. UITERWYK: And they know exactly what

7       they've done. It's a case of sabotage. It's

8       really practicing law by sabotage. They know in

9       every one of these trials it's being shown this

10       way. They've known it in every single case. And

11        what they do is sit back and lay a trap.

12            MR WALKER: That's not true.

13            MR. UITERWYK: That's exactly what they've

14       done in this case.

15            MR. WALKER: I have argued -

16            THE COURT: All right, fine.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Can I take a minute with

18       counsel --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=275
19            MR WALKER: I have argued Heimann

20       designations in at least four trials where the

21        designations were submitted, counters were

22       submitted, and the objections were gone through

23       one by one, just like every other deposition

24       designation.

25            I don't know what happened in the one Willis 3055

1        case that Mr. Uiterwyk tried, but if they followed

2       this procedure, maybe there wasn't an objection.

3       But it is not the way this testimony is typically

4       presented elsewhere in the state.

5            MR. TRENTALANGE: Can we have one moment --

6            THE COURT: Okay. Have a minute and have

7       your last say.

8            MR. UITERWYK: There may be a solution to the

9       problem that they've come up with. Let me make a

10       suggestion. There is two, maybe, solutions.

11        Number 1, the solution is we will defer this

12       particular clip, and they can look at it and then

13       they know what this is anyway. And if they want

14       to do a counterdesignation, let them do a

15       counterdesignation. And if they want to do

16       additional designations, let them do additional

17       designations. That's one solution.

18            In the alternative -- you're calling a

19       historian, correct? In this case?

20            MR WALKER: Talk to the judge. You have --

21             MR. UITERWYK: I'm asking if they're calling

22       a historian.

23            THE COURT: Well, go ahead.

24            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah. If they call a

25       historian, you know, I would like to know, because 3056

1        it affects how we can resolve this problem -- let

2       them call their historian and we can use his

3       deposition in cross-examination.

4            MR WALKER: The resolution to the problem is

5       to enforce the order that Your Honor entered. I

6       don't know how many --1 know -- maybe I'm the

7       only one in this case that finds himself at every

8       hearing saying, Your Honor signed an order that we

9       have relied on and plan to abide by when we're in

10       trial.

11             I have a cross-examination to get ready for.

12       There are witnesses who are coming next week. To

13       suggest that they bypass this deadline and we now

14       have to stop --

15            THE COURT: Well, I know. But there is-

16       there is some -- there is a large -- we've been

17       dealing with this on other hearings as well in

18       terms of prejudice and even witnesses that are

19       disclosed at trial or experts offering opinions

20       that the courts have allowed -- this is a

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=276
21        corporate representative of Reynolds, is it not?

22            MR WALKER: No, Your Honor. This is a

23       witness who had no longer been working for B&W or

24       The American Tobacco Company at the time of his

25       deposition. He was put up on the limited purpose 3057

1        of that deposition in that case to give testimony

2       on behalf of the company. He wasn't even working

3       at the company at the time of the deposition. He

4       had been out of the company for something like

5       nine years.

6            So that's the reason why when this testimony

7       comes up, there have to be deposition designations

8       so Your Honor can hear that. I'm articulating the

9       prejudice right now. We were not planning for

10       this. He was on their witness list, but when the

11        deposition designations deadline came, he, along

12       with about at least ten other witnesses who had

13       been designated by deposition, there were no

14       designations. That tells us this witness is not

15       coming to trial; we are not going to have to deal

16       with his testimony.

17            And I don't have -- to ask us to do any part

18       of what he's describing is prejudicial to us and

19       unfairly so, particularly given that all they had

20       to do was designate from his testimony in

21        accordance with Your Honor's ruling.

22            THE COURT: What if I allowed you to make

23       counterdesignations?

24            MR WALKER: It's still unfair, Judge. We

25       came into this trial expecting that this testimony 3058

1        was not going to be played. It's true --

2            THE COURT: How long is your deposition?

3            MR. UITERWYK: The part that I'm doing?

4            THE COURT: No. How long is the total

5       deposition?

6            MR. BIGGER: Probably an hour, I guess. It's

7       not very long. But he was designated at one point

8       as 310(b)(6), whatever the rule is in Mississippi,

9       as a designated representative.

10            MR WALKER: That's not true, Judge.

11             THE COURT: That's not -- that's beside the

12       point. Whether or not it -- it hasn't been

13       disclosed.

14            MR. UITERWYK: Judge, let's see if they have

15       any counterdesignations.

16            THE COURT: Well, just a minute. I'm not

17       going to allow you to play it now, and what

18       designation -- what page and line number are you

19       designating?

20            MR WALKER: I just wanted the record to

21        reflect that I have been handed today what they

22       should have given us on December 18th, if they

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=277
23       were going to do this.

24            THE COURT: All right.

25            MR. UITERWYK: Can I -3059

1            MR WALKER: This is true gamesmanship, Judge.

2       This is exactly what --

3            THE COURT: All right.

4            MR WALKER: -- is defined as unfair surprise.

5            THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to allow you to

6       make counterdesignations. I'm not going to --

7       you're not going to play it now, and, you know,

8       part of it is, these cases have been going on for

9       years. And it would be one thing if this was a

10       witness that you had no knowledge of, but you

11        yourself have said, Mr. Walker, that this

12       deposition has been played in other cases. It's

13       not as if you're unaware of what the testimony is.

14            And so there is -- there is a test of

15       prejudice. They haven't followed the rules. I

16       understand that. But -- and I agree with you on

17       that. But there is a certain amount of prejudice

18       in cases that say, you know, lots of judges say,

19       well, that witness, you can go ahead and take his

20       deposition, even -- and in some cases even allow

21        it in trial.

22            MR WALKER: Judge -

23            THE COURT: So if you're familiar with it, it

24       has been presented in other cases --1 don't think

25       you dispute that. I do recognize the fact that 3060

1        isn't according to the rules, the rules -- or my

2       scheduling order. But I don't know what real

3       prejudice that you've shown. And since the

4       deposition is only approximately an hour and he's

5       only designating one -- is it one page?

6            MR. UITERWYK: Two minutes and 37 seconds.

7            THE COURT: Well, I know. But what are the

8       pages and lines?

9            MR WALKER: It's two minutes and 31 seconds

10       that they're going to pound on in closing. And

11        what -- the question isn't what I have seen before

12       or what the global, everyone who has represented

13       Reynolds has seen before. The question is what

14       notice have we been given for this case.

15            THE COURT: All right. You'll be given--

16       you'll be given -- how much time do you want to

17       make --1 have overruled your objections. How

18       much time do you want to make your

19       counterdesignations?

20            MR WALKER: I need --1 need two or three

21       business days, Judge.

22            THE COURT: That's fine. You can have until

23       Thursday of -- well --

24            MR WALKER: We're still waiting for their

25       estimate on when they'll rest. 3061

1            THE COURT: You need to do it-

2            MR WALKER: I was supposed to get that this

3       morning.

4            MR. UITERWYK: This is an attack here, Judge.

5            THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk -

6            MR. UITERWYK: Sorry, Judge.

7            THE COURT: When do you -- when do you

8       anticipate closing? Not closing. When do you

9       anticipate resting?

10            MR. UITERWYK: Hopefully by Wednesday,

11       possibly by Thursday.

12            THE COURT: Okay. All right. Make your

13       counterdesignations by Tuesday morning.

14            MR WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

15            THE COURT: Okay.

16            MR. UITERWYK: Do you want a copy of this,

17       Judge?

18            THE COURT: No. We'll be in recess for five

19       minutes.

20            (A recess was taken at 10:34 a.m.)

21             (Court called to order at 10:42 a.m.)

22            THE COURT: We're ready.

23            (The jury returned to the courtroom at 10:44

24       a.m.)

25            THE COURT: All right. Be seated. 3062

1            Mr. Uiterwyk, proceed.

2            MR. UITERWYK: May it the please the Court?

3            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   Let's switch to one more area, kind of a

6   related area, but we've talked about it somewhat, so

7   I'm going to try to go through it a little quicker than

8   we have on some of the other matters.

9            But let's go on the subject of youth

10   marketing. And I believe we've talked about that.

11    Actually, we talked about a Diane Burrows document. I

12   think it was PT3400. Did we not?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   And studies. And also Teague. Did we look

15   at that one? I don't think we looked at Teague yet.

16       A.   No.

17       Q.   And they studied youth and their smoking

18   habits for a 50-year period, from 1934 to 1984. Am I

19   right on that?

20       A.   That's correct.

21        Q.   How far back do you have evidence that they,

22   in fact, were marketing to teenagers and younger

23   people?

24       A.   Back into the 1920s.

25       Q.   All right. And have you studied, Doctor, the 3063

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=279
1   way in which cigarette companies were marketing

2   directly to the youth of this country?

3       A.   Sure. They were -- sampling, handing out

4   free samples, making sure that their marketing was set

5   up around schools, for example.

6       Q.   And why did they do that?

7       A.   Well, because they knew that in order to be a

8   successful company they had to basically recruit the

9   new smokers because that's where brand loyalties are

10   typically established. And those who would capture the

11    largest share of younger smokers tended to be the

12   companies that were the most profitable over the

13   long-term.

14       Q.   And have you provided some documents that, in

15   fact, showed that this -- that this methodology started

16   in the 1920s?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   I'm going to -- do you have a letter, an

19   internal letter, which has been identified as PT4013

20   dated May 17, 1976, an RJR letter and another RJR

21    letter, same type of letter identified as PT415 dated

22   6/13/1928? Are you familiar with these documents?

23       A.   1926 and 1927, yes.

24       Q.   Okay. And are these documents that you

25   obtained from the records from RJR? 3064

1        A.   Yes.

2            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, in connection with

3       the witness's testimony, I would like to offer

4       4013 and 4015.

5            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, we have Williams and

6       youth objections to these documents and ask to be

7       heard.

8            THE COURT: You need a hearing on these? You

9       need -- you need to make argument on these other

10       than what you've already made?

11             MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor, pursuant to

12       Your Honor's rulings.

13            THE COURT: All right. Go ahead. Come up.

14            (At the bench)

15            MR. WALKER: Your Honor -

16            MR. UITERWYK: As far as Williams, I have

17       asked Ms. Humphries to come up.

18            MR. WALKER: I object to that, Your Honor.

19       You've announced your rule numerous times.

20            THE COURT: Yeah. No. You are the lawyer on

21        it, so you are going to handle it.

22            MR. UITERWYK: But he's renewing the

23       Williams, is the only thing I have, Judge.

24            THE COURT: Okay.

25            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, if I understood the 3065

1        ruling that you made, you're only allowing

2       evidence that isn't connected to the plaintiff, to

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=280
3       the extent that it relates to marketing campaigns

4       to the public as a whole. There is no foundation

5       with respect to these documents as to who they

6       were sent to, where this activity that's described

7       in the letter was conducted. And so this is not

8       an example of mass marketing to the public of

9       which Mrs. Loyd was a part. This is -- it's not

10       clear who this was directed to and in what

11        geographic region of the country or anything like

12       that.

13            THE COURT: Okay. Let me take a look at it.

14       Are they basically the same?

15            MR. UITERWYK: Similar.

16            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. And while I'm

17       here, Judge, to maybe avoid having to come back

18       up, we'll have the same objections to other

19       documents, for example, the 1990 letter that was

20       sent to a school in Willow Ridge, New York, at a

21        time when Mrs. Loyd was 55 years old. That --

22            THE COURT: Well -

23            MR. WALKER: I'm sorry. That, we believe, is

24       another example of -- it's not marketing to the

25       public; it's a single letter that was sent to that 3066

1        school. Even if -- even if a handful of other

2       similar letters were sent to a handful of other

3       schools, it's not mass marketing to the public.

4       And there's no connection even under footnote 7 of

5       Townsend. There is no connection between these

6       types of documents before she was born or the

7       Willow Ridge letter or some of the other

8       documents.

9            THE COURT: Well, what concerns me more, or

10       at least initially on this, is I don't even know

11        who authored the letter -- authored this letter.

12       I'm looking at a May 17, 1926 letter. And, also,

13       they were similar -- the two copies of that under

14       tab 96 and 97, which I think are identical --

15            MR. WALKER: They do appear to be identical.

16            THE COURT: But who is this to and who is

17       this from?

18            MR. UITERWYK: He will identify it.

19            THE COURT: Pardon me?

20            MR. UITERWYK: He'll identify it.

21             THE COURT: Okay. He's going to fill it in?

22            MR. UITERWYK: I hope so.

23            THE COURT: Okay. Well, what's your

24       understanding of who is it from and who is it to?

25            MR. UITERWYK: I don't know, Judge. 3067

1            THE COURT: But you think your witness knows?

2            MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

3            MR. WALKER: What he won't fill in, Judge, is

4       anything that will suggest that this was done

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=281
5       broadly to the public as a whole. There are two

6       letters here they are relying on. Again, it's not

7       clear from what geographic region they were sent

8       or that it was part of any national marketing

9       campaign to the public of which Mrs. Loyd was a

10       part, which is what I understood to be Your

11        Honor's ruling.

12            MR. UITERWYK: I think it refers to conduct

13       that they are sending out people to the schools

14       for the marketing of their product. And these are

15       schools that are high schools and prep schools.

16            THE COURT: When was Ms. Loyd born?

17            MR. UITERWYK: She was born in 1936.

18            MR. WALKER: '35.

19            MR. UITERWYK: February 14th of '35.

20            THE COURT: Wouldn't this be evidence of how

21        far back the conspiracy started?

22            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor, because this

23       witness -- and they will say that the conspiracy

24       started in 1953.

25            THE COURT: I thought he just said the 3068

1        conspiracy started in the twenties.

2            MR. WALKER: No. What he said was this --

3       these allegations of youth marketing conduct

4       started in the twenties. But they will contend

5       that the conspiracy began with a meeting in 1953.

6       You may recall Mr. Trentalange in his opening

7       showed a picture of the Plaza Hotel. There won't

8       be any argument from anyone that there was a

9       conspiracy in 1926.

10            MR. PEDROSA: That's why he refers to it as a

11        50-year conspiracy, not an 80-year conspiracy.

12            MR. UITERWYK: This has to do with conduct of

13       others, as far as the reprehensibility of their

14       conduct.

15            THE COURT: I know. But it still has to be

16       related to a class of people or general public of

17       which she was a part.

18            MR. UITERWYK: And she was a part. She was

19       in high school.

20            THE COURT: You are going to have to lay some

21        additional predicate regarding these documents in

22       order to -- in terms of not only who they were

23       directed to but whether or not they were

24       continuing during the period of time after she was

25       born. 3069

1            MR. UITERWYK: I can't specifically say, but

2       I will talk about how they were marketed. During

3       the time I know that it was marketed and that they

4       continued to market to the youth in high schools.

5       He even testified already about how --

6            THE COURT: I know.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=282
7            MR. UITERWYK: -- they gave cigarettes.

8            THE COURT: He's going to have to tie this.

9       So if you can, lay a better predicate, and then

10       I'll make a ruling from the bench.

11             MR. UITERWYK: Thank you, Your Honor.

12            (In open court)

13            MR. UITERWYK: May it please the Court?

14            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   Dr. Cummings, you have done a significant

17   amount of research in the area of youth marketing, have

18   you not?

19       A.   I have.

20       Q.   You have written on it, published on it, and

21    you have actually been awarded -- or been asked by

22   various cancer institutes and various other entities

23   that we all know in that particular area, have you not?

24       A.   I received a grant from the National Cancer

25   Institute to study the issue of youth marketing as it 3070

1   was reflected in the internal business records of the

2   tobacco companies. I've written papers on this topic

3   in peer-reviewed publications. I edited an entire

4   issue of a journal on this subject, which included my

5   own work as well as work from other academic

6   researchers who had been studying this issue that was

7   published in 2004.

8       Q.   We're talking about youth marketing as it

9   relates to cigarettes, correct?

10       A.   Correct.

11        Q.   And then in connection with that, have you --

12   during the time that Jackie was alive during any

13   decades between the 1920s until today, what have you

14   been able to -- information have you been able to

15   obtain as to how these companies market to the teens

16   and where they market to the teens?

17            Let me break that question down. Let me

18   withdraw that.

19            Have you developed, in connection with your

20   research, their marketing to high school -- high school

21    students?

22       A.   Yes, I have.

23       Q.   Tell the jury about that.

24       A.   Well, the basic research question that was

25   posed, since the defendants have represented publicly 3071

1   that they don't market to youth, was to see whether

2   their internal business records, in fact, were

3   consistent with their public statements. And so the

4   research that I did was going back in time to look at

5   evidence within the business records as to whether they

6   were studying the smoking behavior of youth, whether

7   they were actually designing products with the intent

8   of targeting youth, placing their advertising in places

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=283
9   that they knew would have an appeal to youth,

10   formulating their advertising messages that would be

11    appealing to youth, and pricing products and so on.

12            So the four P's of marketing, price --

13   product price, promotion, and placement -- were the

14   areas that I focused on. And I went back and looked at

15   every business record that I could find. I found

16   several hundred. I've created a collection that is

17   available. As I said, I've written on this topic, and

18   it's been cited widely by others, including the most

19   recent Surgeon General's report.

20       Q.   And are these part of the documents?

21        A.   They are.

22       Q.   Part of the documents you did in connection

23   with your writing, these documents that we're going to

24   be talking about?

25       A.   They were. 3072

1        Q.   All right. And what's reflected in these

2   documents similar to activities and conduct of the

3   companies for the decades following the 1920s?

4       A.   Yes. They -- clearly, there's evidence that

5   they were. Based on my review, they were targeting

6   young people, that they, in fact, studied the smoking

7   habits, conducted surveys of high school students, as

8   well as college students, and directed their marketing

9   very specifically to gain a share of the teenage market

10   because they knew that it was critical to their success

11    of the company.

12       Q.   And is the conduct reflected in these letters

13   similar to the conduct that you saw in the other

14   decades, including decades that Jackie Loyd was around?

15       A.   Yes.

16            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I would like to

17       offer in 3014 and 3015.

18            MR. WALKER: Objection. Lack of predicate,

19       Your Honor.

20            MR. UITERWYK: All right. You want me to do

21        it again.

22   BY MR. UITERWYK:

23       Q.   Let me ask you one thing. Do you know --

24   you're familiar with these two particular documents,

25   are you not? 3073

1        A.   I am.

2       Q.   And do you know who they were from and to

3   whom they were directed?

4       A.   They were from the sales department at R.J.

5   Reynolds to their division managers around the United

6   States at two different time periods. One is at the

7   end of the school year, and the other document is the

8   beginning of the school year and talking about, you

9   know, basically sales efforts aimed at certain target

10   groups.

11             MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor?

12            THE COURT: All right. Objections are

13       overruled.

14            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Now if we could,

15       please --

16            THE COURT: What are you moving?

17            MS. HUMPHRIES: Exhibit PT4013, Your Honor,

18       andPT4015.

19            THE COURT: All right. In my book I only

20       have --1 have two copies of 4015 under tab 96 and

21        97, so I don't have 4013.

22            Madam Clerk, do you have 4013 and 4015?

23            THE CLERK: No, I do not.

24            THE COURT: Do you have either one of them?

25            THE CLERK: No, I do not. 3074

1            THE COURT: Okay.

2            MR. UITERWYK: Which one do you not have,

3       Your Honor? It should be on the bottom of --

4            THE COURT: I don't have 4013.

5            MR. UITERWYK: 4013. May I approach, Your

6       Honor?

7            THE COURT: Yes.

8            MR. UITERWYK: May we publish it up to the

9       jury, Your Honor?

10            THE COURT: Let me take a look at it first.

11        Yes.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Let's publish, first, the one

13       from 1926.

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   And you mentioned that this was from the

16   sales department to regional managers of R.J. Reynolds.

17       A.   Correct. Division managers.

18       Q.   And it says here, This requires your

19   immediate attention. The spring term of prep schools,

20   colleges, and universities is rapidly coming to a

21    close.

22            What does he ask them to do? See the rest of

23   it?

24       A.   Basically, they --

25            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. The 3075

1        document speaks for itself.

2            THE COURT: Sustained.

3   BY MR. UITERWYK:

4       Q.   We want you to give every school, college,

5   university in your division, where such work is

6   permitted, a final spring drive on Camels.

7            Is that what they were marketing?

8       A.   Yes.

9       Q.   And going down: In other words, tell them to

10   make every single cigarette count and count big. For

11    instance, they can thank those of the boys who have

12   already been boosting Camels. They can say to all the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=285
13   boys, Good-bye and good luck; see you next fall.

14            Did I read that right?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   And was this the type of marketing that they

17   were doing?

18       A.   Yes.

19            MR. UITERWYK: All right. I don't have 4013,

20       so let's go to 4015.

21             MR. PHILIPSON: That was 4015.

22            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. 4013 then.

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   And this was when, Dr. Cummings?

25       A.   This is another -- this is June 13th, 1928. 3076

1        Q.   And here they refer to, Regular school is

2   over. Summer school is starting. Most all high

3   schools, prep schools, colleges, and universities have

4   finished the spring term, and summer schools are

5   getting underway. This means that thousands of special

6   students and teachers, both men and women, will be

7   assembled at various places during the summer months.

8            Going on.

9            Please get started in this work at once. Get

10   your men intensely interested in lining up these

11    students for our brands both as consumers and boosters

12   and see to it that the stores and stands near the

13   schools have a good supply of our products. In fact,

14   these are the places from which you want to secure the

15   goods to use in this special trade-building work.

16            And is this consistent with what you've seen

17   at other times, that they market to high school kids,

18   prep school kids?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   People under 18?

21        A.   Yes, sir.

22       Q.   All right. Let's go on.

23            Now, have you -- are you familiar with a

24   company called William Esty Company?

25       A.   Yes. 3077

1        Q.   And are you familiar with a Mr. Sugg at R. J.

2   Reynolds?

3       A.   Yes. He was in the marketing department at

4   Reynolds.

5       Q.   And what we are about to show to the jury,

6   after we offer into evidence, is PT1533. Are you

7   familiar with a letter dated 12/9/1959 from William

8   Esty Company to RJR, youth research institute, 1959,

9   cigarette smoking study among high school and college

10   students?

11        A.   Yes.

12            MR. UITERWYK: In connection with the

13       witness's testimony, I would like to offer and

14       introduce into evidence 1533, Your Honor, tab 100,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=286
15       Your Honor.

16            Your Honor, what I would like to do is maybe

17       we can cover this and do -- offer 1533, 3578,

18       2275, 1233, and 1641, 1836, and 1683, which are

19       all on the subject of youth marketing, Your Honor.

20            THE COURT: Give me the tab numbers again,

21        Mr. Uiterwyk.

22            MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry, Your Honor. What I

23       will do is I'll read the numbers.  1533 is tab 100

24       that we're talking about now. PT3578 is tab 101;

25       2275 is tab 102; 1233 is tab 103; 1641 is tab 104; 3078

1        1836 is tab 105; and 1683 is a video, Your Honor,

2       but it's marked under tab 106.

3            MR. WALKER: When you are ready for me to

4       respond, Your Honor --

5            THE COURT: Yes, sir. I'm looking at them.

6            Objections?

7            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. Several of

8       these were actually ones that we addressed outside

9       the presence of the jury, and I think Your Honor

10       has already addressed my objections to those. For

11        the record those are Plaintiffs 2275, tab 102;

12       Plaintiffs 1233, tab 103; Plaintiffs 1641, tab

13        104; plaintiffs 1683K, 106.

14            We do still have objections along the lines

15       of what I explained earlier to 100, tabs 100 and

16        101, which are Plaintiffs 1533 and Plaintiffs

17       3578, also tab 105, Plaintiffs 1836. And then

18       with respect to Plaintiffs 1836, tab 105, we also

19       object as to authenticity.

20            THE COURT: Okay.

21             MR. WALKER: So the -

22            THE COURT: Counsel, approach please.

23            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

24            (At the bench)

25            THE COURT: All right. As to -3079

1            MR. UITERWYK: 3400 is already in, Your

2       Honor.

3            THE COURT: Okay.

4            MR. WALKER: That's not on your list.

5            THE COURT: As to tab 100, PT1533, the

6       objections are overruled. As to 101, PT3578,

7       objections are overruled.

8            (Exhibits PT1533 and PT3578 received.)

9            What is the objection as to 102, PT2275?

10            MR. WALKER: Relevance, 403, and Williams.

11        But I do believe that's one, Your Honor, that is

12       addressed by your prior Williams ruling.

13            THE COURT: All right. That will be received

14       over counsel's objection.

15            (Exhibit PT2275 received.)

16            MR. WALKER: The same is true of --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=287
17            THE COURT:  103.

18            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

19            THE COURT: That will be received.

20            (Exhibit PT1233 received.)

21             THE COURT: Now what about 104, what are your

22       objections to 104?

23            MR. WALKER: The same ones, Your Honor. I

24       believe that is addressed by Your Honor's prior

25       rulings. There are some markings on the first 3080

1       page.

2            THE COURT: Yeah, I don't -- you are going to

3       have to lay a predicate if you want the first page

4       in.

5            MR. UITERWYK: I'll take the first page out.

6            THE COURT: Okay. Other than that, that will

7       be -- your objections are overruled.

8            (Exhibit PT1641 received.)

9            MR. UITERWYK: That, I think, covers all the

10       youth marketing.

11             MR. WALKER: Actually, no.

12            THE COURT:  105.

13            MR. WALKER:  105, yes, Your Honor.

14            MR. UITERWYK: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you

15       did that.

16            MR. WALKER: We have the same Williams, 402,

17       and 403 objections to that one, but I think it's

18       addressed by your prior ruling. All that remains

19       as to 105 is authenticity.

20            THE COURT: Well, yeah, there's an

21        authenticity with respect to the first page memo

22       from --

23            MR. UITERWYK: And he'll be able to identify

24       it.

25            THE COURT: Okay. Lay a predicate for that; 3081

1        otherwise, the other objections are overruled.

2            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

3            THE COURT: Okay.

4            MR. WALKER: And then the last one was 106,

5       but that --

6            THE COURT: Oh, there was 106?

7            MR. WALKER: Yes, but only in the sense that

8       that's --

9            THE COURT: Okay.

10            MR. WALKER: That's addressed by your prior

11        ruling.

12            THE COURT: Thank you.

13            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

14            (In open court)

15            MR. UITERWYK: Dr. Cummings, do you have 62

16       to 98?

17            THE WITNESS: I do.

18            MR. UITERWYK: You don't have 99 to 150?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=288
19            THE WITNESS: Correct.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. May I, Your Honor?

21             THE COURT: Yes.

22            (A document was shown to the witness.)

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   Pursuant to the -- where are my notes?

25            MR. UITERWYK: Bear with me, Your Honor. I 3082

1       put them down and can't -- the notes that I was

2       writing on when you ruled on various matters.

3       Sorry, Your Honor. I put it down somewhere. I've

4       got my notes of what --

5            THE COURT: You don't have trouble finding

6       things in the refrigerator, do you?

7            MR. UITERWYK: I'm getting picked on. I'm

8       going to have to do something, dye my hair or

9       something. I think I remember them anyway, Judge.

10            All right. We were discussing, Your Honor,

11        PT1533, which I'm going to offer into evidence.

12            THE COURT: All right. To the extent I've

13       already ruled on these, then they are received.

14            MR. UITERWYK: I'm going to announce them for

15       the record, Your Honor.

16            THE COURT: I've already done that.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. All right.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   Let's look at 1533, which has been received

20   in evidence, please, Dr. Cummings.

21             All right. What is this document about?

22   When is it and to whom is it?

23       A.   It's from Mr. McGovern who works for William

24   Esty, which is the advertising firm that was hired by

25   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company to Mr. Sugg at R. J. 3083

1   Reynolds. He was in the marketing department at

2   Reynolds. And they are basically talking about

3   transmittal of a survey of high school and college

4   students that R.J. Reynolds had commissioned that

5   William Esty do for them on their behalf, and they are

6   presenting the results of the survey.

7       Q.   All right. And then if we can go to the next

8   page, please.

9            MR. UITERWYK: It's a one-page document. I

10       thought there was a table in it, Table 1. Do you

11        have that --

12            MR. PHILIPSON: No.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   All right. We'll just go ahead.

15            Does this document reflect that they actually

16   were studying and continued to study high school

17   students?

18       A.   Yeah. They did a large scale survey of

19   several thousand high school students, as well as

20   college students, and they reported on the brand

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=289
21   preferences of the students, you know, basically from

22   ages 14 and older.

23       Q.   All right. And was RJR the only one doing

24   that?

25       A.   No. 3084

1        Q.   Did Lorillard do it as well?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   Did all the other cigarette companies that

4   were involved in trade organization of TIRC do it as

5   well?

6       A.   Yes. All of the companies I found evidence

7   that they are surveying high school students and

8   tracking their, you know, tobacco use behaviors and

9   what brands they were smoking.

10       Q.   Let's go to 3578, which has been previously

11    admitted into evidence. What's this document and

12   what's the subject of it?

13       A.   Well, this is, you know, 1980. It's, again,

14   an R.J. Reynolds document from Kay Duffy to Jerry Moore

15   in the marketing department. And they are talking

16   about the -- again, tracking the smoking behavior of

17   teenagers as part of their national family opinion

18   poll, which was their main tracking study that they did

19   on a regular rolling basis throughout the year to look

20   at what brands were successful. And this particular

21    report is pulling out the findings on these brand

22   preferences of 14 to 17-year-olds.

23       Q.   And let's go to the next paragraph, the

24   summary -- summary of their findings. What was the

25   summary of their findings as reflected in there? 3085

1        A.   Well, in 1980 they, you know, they said RJR's

2   share of teenage smokers has stabilized with a share of

3   about 20.2 percent in the spring of 1980, 19.9 percent

4   in the fall of '79 and 21.3 in the spring of 1979.

5   Winston realized a slight increase in the share of

6   teenage smokers in the spring of 1980 of .7 -- 7.8

7   percent versus the fall at 7.2 percent.

8       Q.   All right. We've heard from a Claude Teague

9   before with RJR, have we not?

10       A.   Yes. He was a chemist and then was promoted

11    up into their product development group in the

12   seventies.

13       Q.   And is there a document from him, PT No.

14   2275, which has been received in evidence?

15       A.   Correct. This is a 1973 document, February.

16       Q.   And, now, were all these documents that we're

17   looking at, you didn't see them when they came out, did

18   you?

19            MR. WALKER: Objection. Relevance.

20            THE COURT: Overruled.

21    BY MR. UITERWYK:

22       Q.   When did you see them?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=290
23       A.   These documents I did not see until they

24   became available on the websites in 1999 and on. That

25   was part of the research that I was undertaking. 3086

1        Q.   All right. Now, quickly, what's this

2   document about?

3       A.   This is basically a research memorandum

4   signed by Claude Teague in February of 1973. And he's

5   talking about the importance of Reynolds gaining a

6   share of the youth market to the profitability of their

7   company. And he specifically outlines the

8   characteristics of brands since he was involved in new

9   product development that would have appeal to different

10   groups of smokers. He identifies three specific

11    categories of smokers, what he refers to as presmokers

12   who have not experienced smoking at all; learners, who

13   were young people who were experimenting with smoking;

14   and then smokers or confirmed smokers, as he called

15   them, which were people who were smoking. And then he

16   looks at the various factors that were important and

17   then talks about how that translates into product

18   design features.

19       Q.   All right. Let's look briefly at a few

20   excerpts. Let's go to page 2 of PT2275, the bottom.

21    Start at the top and then go to the bottom. Right

22   there, let's go to "realistically."

23            Realistically, if our company is to survive

24   and prosper over the long term, we must get our share

25   of the youth market. In my opinion, this will require 3087

1   new brands tailored to the youth market. I believe it

2   unrealistic to expect that the existing brands

3   identified with the over-30 established market can ever

4   become the in products with the youth group. Thus, we

5   need new brands designed to be particularly attractive

6   to the young smoker, while ideally at the same time

7   appealing to all smokers.

8            Did I read that right?

9       A.   You did.

10       Q.   And then if we go on to, say, Bates 3, did

11    they then discuss how they should do this and what he

12   recommends what they should do?

13       A.   Well, he talks about the presmokers. For the

14   presmoker and learner, the physical effects of smoking

15   are largely unknown, unneeded, or actually quite

16   unpleasant or awkward. The expected or derived

17   psychological effects are largely responsible for

18   influencing the presmoker to try smoking and provide

19   sufficient motivation during the learning period to

20   keep the learner going despite the physical

21    unpleasantness and awkwardness of the period.

22            And then it goes on to talk about what

23   happens after the learning period is over in the next

24   paragraph.

25       Q.   All right. And then does he go --3088

1            MR. UITERWYK: Keep on going, Barron, to the

2       next one. Next slide up.

3   BY MR. UITERWYK:

4       Q.   Does he then do a -- he basically prepares a

5   table where he discusses the presmoker, the learner,

6   and the smoker and what effects -- or what effects that

7   are expected or derived from the cigarette as smoking

8   itself?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   And rather than hit every single point, can

11    you give in summary form what this particular table

12   shows us?

13       A.   Sure. This table is divided up into two

14   parts, physical effects and psychological effects.

15   There is a plus sign for a factor that's important,

16   that is neutral. It's a zero, and it's actually

17   aversive or negative. It's the negative sign. So

18   scoring the different factors for presmokers, learners,

19   and smokers -- actually, if you go to the first part of

20   the table, the physical part, which was on top, in

21    terms of product design, they are saying that the

22   physical effects of smoking are, you know, basically

23   unknown to the presmoker or are actually aversive, two

24   negatives, for the learner, and three plusses for the

25   confirmed smoker in terms of their nicotine response. 3089

1    So smokers are smoking for nicotine and presmokers and

2   learners it's actually either unknown or aversive.

3       Q.   And let me stop you there. What is he trying

4   to do with this analysis that he's doing?

5            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning

6       and intent.

7            THE COURT: Sustained.

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   When he talks about the smoker and learner

10   and presmoker, are they trying to -- tell us what they

11    are doing in this document, not what they're trying to

12   do?

13            MR. WALKER: Same objection, Your Honor.

14            THE COURT: Sustained.

15   BY MR. UITERWYK:

16       Q.   All right. Go ahead and let's discuss the

17   document, then. He asked for nicotine response, and he

18   has zero, which means no effect, obviously, on the

19   presmoker because they don't smoke.

20       A.   Right.

21        Q.   And on the learner, you've got negative

22   nicotine response because they haven't gotten addicted

23   yet?

24       A.   That's right.

25       Q.   And are these -- are these analyses being 3090

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=292
1    done and do they use these analyses later on for the

2   purposes of designing cigarettes that appeal to the

3   learner and then the smoker?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   And will we see evidence of that, in fact,

6   that these recommendations are then taken over and

7   taken to another department and used for the

8   manufacturing, designing, manipulation, and engineering

9   of the product and then marketing of that product?

10            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading and

11        argumentative.

12            THE COURT: Sustained.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   All right. What do they do with this

15   stuff -- with the stuff, with this analysis in

16   developing products?

17       A.   Dr. Teague, who is involved in new product

18   development and his colleagues in cigarette development

19   at Reynolds, used the information that's contained in

20   this memorandum. It's reflected in research, R&D for

21    the company, and the introduction of brands and how

22   they selected brands to have low irritation, to have,

23   you know, not too much nicotine, because it would

24   actually be too aversive for the learner. So youth

25   brands were designed with the characteristics that are 3091

1   reflected in this table so they would be able to

2   capture a share of the youth/teenage market, because

3   that was important to their profitability.

4       Q.   And they have on here irritability,

5   harshness, flavor, mouth feel, visual. Are all

6   these -- and let's go on. Manipulative effects,

7   handling, puffing, holding, ashing, and extinguishing,

8   are all these things that they take into account in

9   their designing and engineering and manipulation of the

10   product?

11        A.   Yes. With younger smokers in particular,

12   reducing the harshness of the smoke, lower irritation

13   and harshness, which they talk about here, is perhaps

14   involving pH manipulation in the research part of the

15   document at the end with recommendations. And --

16       Q.   Sorry.

17       A.   And then they talk at the bottom about the

18   psychosocial effects.

19       Q.   And let's talk about a couple there. Group

20   identification. The smoker really doesn't have group

21    identification, do they or she, following their

22   addiction?

23       A.   It's not the main driver of their smoking

24   behavior. Once one becomes addicted, what he's saying

25   is it's being driven by nicotine. However --3092

1            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Move to

2       strike as to the meaning of the document.

3            THE COURT: Sustained. Well, sustained. I'm

4       going to sustain your objection.

5            MR. UITERWYK: All right. I'm just trying to

6       speed --

7            THE COURT: Okay.

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   Do presmokers and learners, do they start to

10   smoke because the pre -- because of a group

11    identification?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   And then once they become smokers and become

14   addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine, does the

15   group identification or participation and conforming,

16   is that involved in their activities as regards to the

17   reason they smoke?

18       A.   According to Dr. Teague, it's a neutral

19   factor for a confirmed smoker, whereas it's very

20   important for pre-learners --or for learners and

21   presmokers.

22       Q.   All right. Now, under self-image

23   enhancement, they have -- is that similar to the group

24   identification for the presmoker and the learner?

25       A.   Yes. 3093

1        Q.   And they have in here identification with

2   valued persons, danger, sophisticated, and free to

3   choose. Do we see that on the presmoker and the

4   learner?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   But what do they have for the smoker as far

7   as free to choose?

8       A.   It's a negative.

9       Q.   Let's go on, if we could, please.

10            Hold on one minute. Let's go to 

11             MR. UITERWYK: This is 5 and 6, isn't it,

12       Baron? Yeah.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   Did he discuss the minimum requirements of

15   nicotine in this document?

16       A.   On page 4.

17       Q.   I'm looking for it.

18       A.   Under A.

19            MR. UITERWYK: Down, down. Right there.

20   BY MR. UITERWYK:

21        Q.   And, again, in this document, does he

22   identify what the minimum requirement of nicotine is

23   for the confirmed smoker?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   And, again, it's the level of 1.0 to 1.3? 3094

1        A.   That's correct.

2       Q.   And they should -- holding down the pH -- the

3   rate of absorption should be kept low by holding down

4   pH, probably 6.6.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=294
5            Do you know why they would do that?

6       A.   Yeah, they -- again, because these are

7   younger people, you know, pre -- the learner group, who

8   would just be starting out, if you've got too much

9   nicotine absorbed rapidly, it would have an aversive

10   effect, and they would reject continued smoking. So

11    they wanted to give enough nicotine to keep the

12   confirmed smoker smoking but not too much nicotine to

13   reject the learners, who were going to be -- become the

14   smokers.

15       Q.   And so is this consistent with what we talked

16   about earlier yesterday of how they designed,

17   engineered, and manipulated to make sure that the

18   learning smoker would cause the addiction and then the

19   sustained or what they call the confirmed smoker, or

20   whatever, would continue to sustain addiction?

21             MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading and

22       argumentative.

23            THE COURT: Overruled.

24            THE WITNESS: Yes, it is.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 3095

1        Q.   All right. Let's go on. And did they -- you

2   talked about that they actually did follow up on this

3   proposal that Mr. Teague did in '72, correct?

4       A.   Yes. It's part of their R&D, research and

5   development.

6       Q.   And let's go to Exhibit No. 1233, which has

7   been received in evidence, Mr. Teague. Tab, I believe,

8    103. And, briefly, this document is -- this is from

9   Colby, actually, not a Teague document, from Colby to

10   Blevins, right?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Are you familiar with these documents?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   This is actually a few minutes -- a few

15   months after Teague, is it not?

16       A.   That's right. Also 1973. And Mr. Blevins is

17   director of marketing. And Mr. Colby is in, you know,

18   research and development at a very high level of the

19   company.

20       Q.   And is this what they -- this, basically, is

21    following up the recommendations of Dr. Teague?

22       A.   Yes. This is a cigarette concept to assure

23   RJR a larger segment of the youth market, is the title

24   of the memo.

25       Q.   And what is the summary that they put there? 3096

1        A.   It is suggested to develop a new RJR youth

2   appeal brand based on the concept of going back at

3   least halfway to the technological design of the

4   Winston and other filtered cigarettes of the 1950s.

5       Q.   Are you familiar with the term technological

6   design?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=295
7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   What's referenced about the technological

9   design? What is there about a technological design of

10   Winstons in the 1950s?

11             MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning

12       and intent.

13            THE COURT: All right. Lay a predicate -

14            MR. UITERWYK: All right.

15            THE COURT: --as to those words.

16   BY MR. UITERWYK:

17       Q.   Are there certain key words within the

18   industry, like the high delivery cigarette that we

19   talked about, the optimum level of nicotine, those

20   satisfaction, words of that nature? Is there also,

21    like in this one, where they talked -- are those

22   standard kind of key words within the industry?

23       A.   Yes.

24       Q.   Frequently used?

25       A.   Yes. 3097

1        Q.   And as a result of your study, have you

2   learned what the meaning and how those words, what they

3   are, in fact, referring to?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   And including like, for instance, this one,

6   where they use the term, Go back at least halfway to

7   the technological design of the Winston and other

8   filtered cigarettes in the 1950s. Do you know what

9   that means?

10       A.   Yes. They are talking about the --

11             MR. WALKER: Same objection, Your Honor.

12            THE COURT: Sustained.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   What is -- in the industry, when they

15   reference technological design, what are they referring

16   to?

17            MR. WALKER: Same objection.

18            THE COURT: Sustained.

19            MR. UITERWYK: We're talking about the

20       industry, not the --

21             THE COURT: I know, but you -- approach,

22       please.

23            (At the bench)

24            MR. UITERWYK: I will rephrase the question.

25            THE COURT: This is the last time I'm going 3098

1        to go over this. Okay? The words -- the ruling

2       is if the words -- if they are plain words, they

3       are plain words, and they don't need an

4       explanation. If they have some special meaning to

5       him as an epidemiologist or in the field of public

6       health separate and apart from what the ordinary

7       meaning is, then you've laid the predicate, but he

8       hasn't said that.

9            MR. UITERWYK: Correct. I'll follow up.

10            (In open court)

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   As an epidemiologist, as an expert in the

13   field of public health, particularly smoking and

14   health, as an expert who has reviewed thousands and

15   thousands of documents, do you become familiar with

16   those words in connection with that expertise and do

17   you need to?

18       A.   Sure.

19       Q.   And do you routinely reuse those in

20   connection with your research, your awareness of those

21   particular terms?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   And let me ask the question with regard to --

24   was there a design in the fifties, a specific

25   technological design in the fifties, that you have 3099

1   learned in connection with your research, in connection

2   with your expertise as an epidemiologist, as an expert

3   in smoking behavior and public health, that you have

4   learned that they had during that time frame?

5       A.   Yes. It was brand formulation.

6       Q.   What do you mean by "brand formulation" ?

7       A.   The particular blends of tobacco, the use of

8   certain amounts of reconstituted tobacco, and the use

9   of additives, as well as engineering features built

10   into the product, such as the filter, to target certain

11    specifications in the product in regards to the

12   delivery of nicotine.

13       Q.   And do they, in this document, in fact, talk

14   about how the main characteristics of the technological

15   design of the 1950s of Winston and other filtered

16   cigarettes which they manufactured?

17            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. The

18       document speaks for itself.

19            THE COURT: Sustained.

20   BY MR. UITERWYK:

21        Q.   What do they say here with regard to the

22   cigarettes of the 1950s and how they were different?

23       A.   They said they delivered more flavor,

24   parentheses, tar. They delivered more enjoyment, more

25   kicks, nicotine, and they delivered more puffs, at 3100

1   least 20 percent more.

2       Q.   And what do they conclude?

3       A.   It said -- well, it goes on, A fringe benefit

4   which may or may not be promotable is that such a

5   cigarette would develop a much less --

6       Q.   I don't want to get into that. Let's go to

7   the bottom paragraph. Okay?

8       A.   Just the highlight?

9       Q.   Yes.

10       A.   Okay. I believe it would be possible to

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=297
11    achieve the desired effect by going to a tar level of

12   today's Pall Mall nonfilter type of about 29 milligrams

13   tar, 1.8 milligrams nicotine. Still with an old style

14   filter, any designed additional nicotine kick could be

15   easily obtained through pH regulation.

16       Q.   And the term "additional nicotine kick," does

17   that have special meaning separate and apart from the

18   ordinary meaning that we would know -- a separate

19   meaning based on your expertise as an epidemiologist

20   and an expert in public health and smoking?

21        A.   Yes. I have seen that term used many times

22   in their internal business records.

23       Q.   All right. And what is the meaning of that

24   term?

25       A.   It basically means the impact of nicotine on 3101

1   the -- on the smoker and how they would rate product

2   satisfaction.

3       Q.   And the effect of that additional nicotine on

4   the smoker would be what?

5       A.   That would be that the nicotine affecting the

6   smoker relates to satisfying their nicotine addiction.

7       Q.   And how would that be obtained as regards to

8   this particular product that they were talking about

9   here?

10       A.   Through the technological design

11    specifications of blending, the use of the additives,

12   and also the design of the filter, all would affect the

13   pH delivery of the product and would affect the amount

14   of free nicotine that one is getting unbound nicotine.

15       Q.   All right. I believe we're done with that

16   document. And if we can go to the next document, which

17   is 1641 and has been received in evidence.

18            Let's take that -

19            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, actually --

20            MR. UITERWYK: Take that page off. Go to the

21        second page.

22            THE COURT: Bates 002?

23            MR. UITERWYK: Yes. 1641,002.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   Filters. Tell us what that document is 3102

1    about?

2       A.   Sure. This is a presentation from the head

3   of marketing at R.J. Reynolds to their board of

4   directors of the company in September of 1974 in Hilton

5   Head. And Mr. Tucker is basically outlining the goals

6   for the marketing program for R.J. Reynolds over the

7   next year.

8       Q.   And would -- that paper up there, was that

9   from Mr. Tucker?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   Did you identify it as being a document from

12   Mr. Tucker?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=298
13       A.   I have.

14       Q.   Have you seen other documents by Mr. Tucker

15   similar to this --

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.    with his handwriting?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   And his signature?

20       A.   Correct.

21        Q.   All right. And does that basically appear to

22   you to be his signature and handwriting of Mr. Tucker?

23       A.   Yes. And, plus, he was the head of marketing

24   at the time, and this was -- when this document was

25   produced. 3103

1        Q.   Now -- and this is how long after the Colby

2   memorandum and Teague memorandum?

3       A.   It's really just afterwards, about, you know,

4   about eight, nine months or so.

5            MR. UITERWYK: All right. And then going, if

6       we could on there, on this document, go to the

7       next paragraph, please. Bates 4 -- that's it

8       right there.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   And were they following up on the

11    recommendations in the memoranda?

12       A.   Yes, they were.

13       Q.   And did they at that time -- let's look at

14   the growing importance of the young adult in the

15   cigarette market. In 1960 this young adult market, the

16    14 to 24 age group, represented 21 percent of the

17   population. Then they -- and then they conclude, They

18   represent tomorrow's cigarette business. And as this

19    14 to 24 age matures, they will account for a key share

20   of the total cigarette volume for at least the next 25

21    years.

22            Did they also refer to these earlier as the

23   replacement smokers?

24       A.   They did in the Diane Burrows document, yes.

25       Q.   And this is a marketing plan, is what they're 3104

1    doing here?

2            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

3            THE COURT: Sustained.

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   What is this plan that they are doing in this

6   document?

7       A.   This is an outline of their marketing plan,

8   the highest levels of the company, the board of

9   directors.

10       Q.   All right. And what -- did they develop a

11    strategy as a result of that?

12       A.   Yeah. They outlined the strategy of how they

13   are going to succeed in capturing a share of that

14    14-to-24-year-old market, and they describe exactly

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=299
15   what they are going to do.

16            MR. UITERWYK: Keep on going. The part where

17       the strategy becomes clear, that paragraph right

18       there.

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   And are they comparing their brands here

21    versus Salem, Marlboro, and Kool?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   And then they conclude, Winston is at the 14

24   percent in the 14 to 24 age group versus Marlboro at 33

25   percent, and they go on. 3105

1            It says, This suggests a slow market share

2   erosion for us in the years to come unless the

3   situation is corrected. And then they establish a

4   strategy.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Page 12.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   And is this strategy that we have up on the

8   screen?

9       A.   Yes. It says, Our strategy becomes clear for

10   our established brands. Direct advertising appeal to

11    the young -- younger smoker while being true to the

12   brand's basic product attributes, taste for Winston,

13   refreshment for Salem, without alienating the brand's

14   current franchise. So that was their marketing goal.

15       Q.   And what do they do to get that marketing

16   goal?

17       A.   Well, they go through each of their brands

18   and talk about how -- how they are going to market each

19   brand, including, you know, talking about, you know,

20   reformulating some of their brand like Camel and

21    introducing new advertising to compete directly against

22   the brands that were becoming the more successful youth

23   brands like Marlboro and Kool.

24            So for Camel they talked about introducing a

25   new campaign called Meet the Turk, which had a new 3106

1   product design. It was designed with a new

2   Marlboro-like blend in the product. And they're going

3   to increase their spending around that. And they

4   talked about exactly where they were going to spend the

5   money on certain kinds of promotions such as motorcycle

6   or motocross racing. For Winston it was NASCAR they

7   talked about. So that's what they were talking about.

8       Q.   Who was -- who was Meet the Turk?

9       A.   Meet the Turk was an ad campaign for Camel

10   cigarettes. Camel had been a popular brand in the

11    early fifties and declined. It had introduced a filter

12   in 1968 to that brand. But its share of the youth

13   market had declined dramatically. And they changed it,

14   started to change that at this meeting in 1974. And

15   they were testing, doing test markets of a new blend

16   with the new ad campaign that was very much sort of a

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=300
17   macho version of the Marlboro Man, but more updated for

18   the time period, the mid 1970s.

19       Q.   And who was that campaign directed to as far

20   as age groups?

21        A.   It was directed to 14-to-24 year-olds,

22   primarily males.

23       Q.   And did they have a Meet the Turk program set

24   up?

25       A.   They had test markets, data which had been 3107

1    done. And then in 1975 they launched the Meet the Turk

2   campaign nationally.

3       Q.   Let's look at 1836, if we could, please.

4            Is that Mr. Tucker again?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   And-

7            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

8            MR. UITERWYK: He's identified Mr. Tucker,

9       Your Honor.

10            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I don't think a

11       predicate has been laid for this document.

12            THE COURT: Okay. Agreed. Lay a predicate,

13       please.

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   All right. Is this the same Mr. Tucker --

16            MR. WALKER: May we have the document taken

17       down?

18            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah.  1836.

19            THE COURT: Take it down, please.

20   BY MR. UITERWYK:

21        Q.   1836. First of all, in the first page,

22   who -- whose -- do you recognize that handwriting?

23       A.   Yes. It's Mr. Tucker's handwriting.

24       Q.   And on whose stationery is that?

25       A.   It's Mr. Tucker's stationery. It's a memo 3108

1   from Mr. Tucker, who was the head of marketing at the

2   time for Reynolds.

3       Q.   And is there a signature on the bottom?

4       A.   Well, yeah. There is "T."

5       Q.   "T"?

6       A.   Yeah. "T" for Tucker.

7       Q.   Have you seen "T" for Tucker on other

8   documents?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   And is this an RJR document?

11        A.   It is.

12       Q.   And is it part of the records that you --

13   where you obtained this document?

14       A.   Yes. It's dated January 24.

15       Q.   What year?

16       A.   1975. And there is an accompanying memo from

17   the day before from Jim Heim to Mr. Tucker.

18       Q.   And is actually that memo addressed to

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=301
19   Mr. Tucker?

20       A.   Correct.

21        Q.   All right.

22       A.   He's responding back to the earlier memo.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'm going to

24       reoffer the cover page.

25            THE COURT: Any additional objections? 3109

1            MR. WALKER: No additional, Your Honor.

2            THE COURT: All right. It will be received.

3   BY MR. UITERWYK:

4       Q.   The test market plan of Turk is the most

5   professionally and the most conclusive --1 can't read

6   that.

7       A.   Ever done.

8       Q.   All right. And keep on going.

9       A.   On the basis of the -- and I can't read that

10   word -- attached, like to go national with Turk and the

11   known blend. The new blend, rather. I'm sorry.

12       Q.   All right. And then the letter that's

13   attached, can we quickly go to those portions you think

14   are significant as to what they did with this Meet the

15   Turk campaign?

16       A.   They said they were going to launch it in

17   April of 1975, and they did.

18       Q.   And what -- for what -- what would they do --

19   strike that.

20            What was their marketing objective that they

21    identified in that memorandum?

22       A.   This is from the day before, from Jim Heim to

23   Mr. Tucker. And he says, The goal is to increase our

24   young adult franchise. To ensure increased and longer

25   term growth for Camel filter, the brand must increase 3110

1   its share penetration among the 14-24 age group, which

2   have a new set of more liberal values and which

3   represent tomorrow's cigarette business.

4       Q.   All right. Is this the only brand that was

5   ever designed for the 14-to-24 age group?

6       A.   No.

7       Q.   Do you have records and information that they

8   manipulated, designed and engineered cigarettes for

9   this group with other brands?

10       A.   Yes, I do.

11        Q.   And that they did so in order to lure the

12   replacement smoker?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   And they did the ad campaigns to do that as

15   well?

16       A.   They did.

17            MR. WALKER: Objection, leading.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   Did they do their ad campaigns to do that as

20   well?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=302
21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   All right. Now, let's look at 1683, which is

23   an interview of Ann Browder. First of all -- 1683 K.

24            Before we get to that clip, can you tell the

25   jury a little bit of background, very briefly, as to 3111

1   what this clip is going to be showing?

2       A.   Sure. Ann Browder was a spokesperson for the

3   cigarette manufacturers. She worked for the Tobacco

4   Institute, which was a trade association funded by the

5   major cigarette manufacturers. And she appeared -- she

6   appeared on many media, but in this particular clip in

7    1983, October of 1983, she appeared on the show 20/20,

8   with John Stossel. And she was asked, basically sent

9   to represent the major manufacturers, and including R.

10   J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Brown & Williamson and

11    Lorillard, who had been asked to send representatives

12   to comment on the show, and they sent Ann Browder as

13   their representative.

14       Q.   And what is she going to be talking about?

15       A.   In this clip she is talking about the

16   position that the manufacturers had stated repeatedly

17   over many decades, which is that they do not market to

18   youth. And she is questioned about that, and she talks

19   about the age of maturity, which they define what youth

20   or adults are.

21             MR. UITERWYK: All right. Play the clip,

22       please, Baron.

23            (The video clip was played as follows:)

24            MS. BROWDER: I feel very strongly that

25       cigarette smoking is an adult custom that one 3112

1        should not even consider until they've reached the

2       age of maturity.

3            MR. STOSSEL: What's maturity?

4            MS. BROWDER: Anyone over the age of 21.

5            A SPEAKER: These pictures are from Superman

6       II. Marlboro, made by Philip Morris, was shown at

7       least 13 times. I asked the Tobacco Institute why

8       Marlboros were shown so often in Superman II.

9            MS. BROWDER: Do you think cigarette

10       manufacturers had something to do with that?

11             MR. STOSSEL: Yeah, I think that -

12            MS. BROWDER: Cigarette manufacturers don't

13       make movies.

14            MR. STOSSEL: But what do you think, that the

15       movie maker just showed Marlboro on his own?

16            MS. BROWDER: Perhaps the movie maker was a

17       Marlboro smoker.

18            (Video clip concluded.)

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   Now that was on Marlboro. Has your research

21    in this area shown that product placement was done in

23            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Outside

24       the scope of the claims in this case.

25            THE COURT: Give me a minute. 3113

1            MR. UITERWYK: Let me rephrase the question.

2            THE COURT: Okay.

3   BY MR. UITERWYK:

4       Q.   Have you seen that they have done product

5   placement in other movies that would be -- that would

6   be attractive to the youth of this country?

7       A.   Yes. Many of the manufacturers did that,

8   including R.J. Reynolds. They hired a company called

9   Cowan & Rogers that did product placements in movies

10   Brown & Williamson did the same. They hired Sylvester

11    Stallone for five of his movies to have product

12   placements. And Philip Morris did that. It wasn't

13   the-

14            MR. WALKER: Same objection, Your Honor.

15            THE COURT: All right. Approach, please?

16            (At the bench.)

17            THE COURT: I'm not sure I understand what

18       the -- what the objection is.

19            MR. WALKER: I was hoping you would give me a

20       chance to explain, Your Honor.

21             THE COURT: I was looking for the sheet of

22       paper which I had. I had negligence, strict

23       liability, fraudulent --

24            MR. WALKER: Concealment.

25            THE COURT: -- concealment. And what's the 3114

1        fourth one?

2            MR. WALKER: Conspiracy to fraudulently

3       conceal.

4            There is no claim for fraudulent

5       misrepresentation. And where this appears to be

6       headed, he's just showed the jury a clip of Ann

7       Browder essentially suggesting that the tobacco

8       companies were not behind the placement of

9       Marlboro in the movie Superman.

10            THE COURT: Right.

11             MR. WALKER: And now he wants to show that

12       that's not true. That's not a concealment claim.

13       That's a misrepresentation claim. It's some kind

14       of affirmative fraud. They don't have a claim for

15       that in this case.

16            MR. UITERWYK: That's not a concealment

17       claim? They deny -- this is a person who is a

18       representative of the tobacco industry, and

19       denying that they market to youth and they -- that

20       they are marketing cigarettes to youth? And, in

21        fact, that's just not true. That sounds to me

22       like concealment.

23            MR. WALKER: I'm not talking about the youth

24       marketing. I didn't object to that. My objection

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=304
25       is --3115

1            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah, but my question was

2       about youth marketing though.

3            MR. WALKER: But where this is headed is he's

4       played for the jury a clip of Ann Browder

5       suggesting that the companies were not behind the

6       placement of Marlboro. And where this is headed,

7       I believe, is to evidence that -- which he said

8       wasn't true, that is a misrepresentation claim.

9       If he's not going there, then I won't have an

10       objection.

11             THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to overrule --

12            MR. UITERWYK: I'm not going there.

13            THE COURT: Then I'll overrule your

14       objection.

15            MR. WALKER: Sure.

16            (In open court.)

17            MR. UITERWYK: May it please the Court?

18            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   Now, that was Ann Browder. And she was

21    speaking on behalf of what organization?

22       A.   She worked for the Tobacco Institute, but she

23   was speaking on behalf of all the cigarette

24   manufacturers that were part of the team, Tobacco

25   Institute. 3116

1        Q.   And are you aware, based on your research, of

2   who paid for the Superman II product placement?

3            MR. WALKER: Objection. Relevance, 403, not

4       a claim in this case.

5            THE COURT: Sustained.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Are you aware as to whether or not Philip

8   Morris specifically had Marlboro placed in Superman II?

9            MR. WALKER: Same objection, Your Honor.

10            THE COURT: Sustained.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   All right. Let me go on. Going to the last

13   subject that you are going to be testifying to, which

14   is the 50-year cover up.

15            I don't know if you want to start now and get

16   into it for a little while.

17            THE COURT: You are going into a new area?

18            MR. UITERWYK: Fifty-year coverup, the last

19       area, Your Honor.

20            THE COURT: Okay. And roughly, roughly,

21        approximately how much time do you think you will

22       need, you are going to need on that?

23            MR. UITERWYK: As quick as I can do it.

24            THE COURT: No, no, no.

25            MR. UITERWYK: No. I do want to get it done 3117

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=305
1        quickly, Your Honor.

2            THE COURT: Is it a 20-minute item--

3            MR. UITERWYK: No.

4            THE COURT: -- or is it an hour item?

5            MR. UITERWYK: No, no. It's a couple hours.

6            THE COURT: All right. We'll take our lunch

7       break now.

8            I have a couple of things to attend to during

9       lunch, so I'm going to give you an extended lunch.

10       We're going to be in recess until 1:30.

11             Keep in mind my instructions. Keep an open

12       mind. Do not discuss this case or communicate

13       about this case in any manner, shape, way or form.

14            We'll be in recess until 1:30.

15            (The jury retired from the courtroom at 11:51

16       a.m.)

17            THE COURT: All right. You may be seated.

18            Dr. Cummings, let me ask you --

19            Wait until the door closes. I can't see. Is

20       it closed?

21             MR. TRENTALANGE: The jury is out of the

22       courtroom. Yes, sir, the door is closed.

23            THE COURT: You may be seated.

24            It's been brought to my attention that you

25       are a witness, you are scheduled to be a witness 3118

1        in a federal court in Ft. Myers?

2            THE WITNESS: Correct.

3            THE COURT: And do you know when that trial

4       started?

5            THE WITNESS: It started on Tuesday.

6            THE COURT: Okay.

7            THE WITNESS: And they have had openings, I

8       believe. They had their first witness. My

9       understanding is Dr. Burns is on the stand.

10            THE COURT: Is this -- my intention is to

11        have you complete your direct and

12       cross-examination. So have you communicated

13       that -

14            You are testifying on behalf of the

15       plaintiffs, I assume?

16            THE WITNESS: Yes.

17            THE COURT: Have you communicated to

18       plaintiffs counsel that you are testifying here?

19            THE WITNESS: I have. I have been in touch

20       with plaintiffs counsel. They know the schedule.

21        Their schedule, I think, was a little bit delayed

22       from what they had anticipated.

23            THE COURT: Well, as far as you know, they

24       have other witnesses to put on?

25            THE WITNESS: As far as I know, yeah. 3119

1            THE COURT: Have you been, either directly or

2       through plaintiffs counsel, been told to appear

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=306
3       in federal district court by the judge, the

4       presiding judge in that?

5            THE WITNESS: No, I have not.

6            THE COURT: Is it your understanding, it's

7       more for a matter of convenience of the other

8       lawyers that you be there on Monday?

9            THE WITNESS: Well, I had anticipated, not

10       knowing how long this would take, that I would --

11        actually, I thought I would be done and there

12       today, but --

13            THE COURT: Well, it's my intention to have

14       you complete your examination, which obviously is

15       not going to be completed today. So you need to

16       communicate over lunch to plaintiffs counsel.

17            Do you expect to be more than --

18            I assume you are going to complete your

19       examination of Dr. Cummings today?

20            MR. UITERWYK: I better. Provided, Judge -

21        and I said a couple hours. That's without

22       objections, side bars and bench conferences.

23            THE COURT: Okay. Well, that's your

24       intention. Assuming we do that, do you think you

25       can complete your cross-examination in one day? 3120

1            MR. WALKER: You mean in one day total time

2       or today?

3            THE COURT: Yes. No, one. If we start with

4       cross-examination on Monday, do you think you will

5       complete your examination on Monday?

6            MR. WALKER: I think it's likely.

7            THE COURT: Mr. Pedrosa?

8            MR. PEDROSA: My cross-examination will be a

9       lot shorter than Mr. Walker's. But obviously, if

10       Mr. Walker goes until 4:00 or 4:30 in the

11        afternoon --

12            THE COURT: How much time do you think you

13       need, roughly?

14            MR. PEDROSA: I would say probably about an

15       hour, hour and a half.

16            THE COURT: Okay. All right. Well, you need

17       to communicate with the lawyers that have retained

18       you that you will be here Monday. And perhaps

19       even -- you've heard the testimony -- you have

20       heard the lawyers' comments as well as I have,

21        that it may even be --1 would think that we could

22       get your cross-examination done on Monday, but you

23       can't -- you can't tell them that anyone is going

24       to guarantee that.

25            So they need to plan at least until Tuesday 3121

1        sometime for you to appear in that case, and they

2       need to call other witnesses. Okay? If that

3       becomes a problem then they can communicate it to

4       the judge and have him call me. But that's my

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=307
5       intention. You are here in court. You are going

6       to complete your testimony unless -- unless the

7       judge --

8            What's his name?

9            MR. WALKER: Magnuson.

10            THE COURT: Unless he contacts me and there's

11        some other problem that I am unaware of. But

12       usually, once a witness -- you obviously can't be

13       in both places at the same time, and you have

14       already started here, so you are going to complete

15       your testimony unless there is some exceptional

16       circumstances that I am unaware of.

17            THE WITNESS: I will communicate that. I

18       think I have been, already.

19            THE COURT: Okay. You have probably met this

20       problem before.

21             THE WITNESS: Unfortunately, it seems to be a

22       common one.

23            THE COURT: Okay. I mean--okay.

24            All right. We will be in recess. I would

25       like counsel to review the exhibits that you have 3122

1        done this morning that seem to -- we were able to

2       pick up the pace a little bit, so maybe you could

3       have lunch for whatever period of time and then

4       we'll reconvene at 1:30.

5            MR. UITERWYK: You wanted, I believe, for me

6       to tell you this morning -- I'm not sure if it was

7       this morning or this afternoon, about designations

8       of the depositions that you needed to still

9       review, the designations.

10            THE COURT: Yeah. I hope you give me the

11        answer that I am looking for.

12            MR. UITERWYK: I'm not going to give them.

13       Provided the whole deposition isn't obliterated,

14       because they've literally objected to everything,

15       and then I have to call and do the other one. But

16       provided that be the case, that I'm basically

17       going to use Robinson, Your Honor, and not Leung.

18            THE COURT: All right. Then I'll review

19       Robinson over the weekend and give you my rulings

20       on designated portions on Monday.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

22            THE COURT: Okay?

23            MR. WALKER: Your Honor?

24            THE COURT: Yes.

25            MR. WALKER: Are we safe telling our 3123

1        witnesses that we will not need a witness before

2       Wednesday, or before Thursday, based on the

3       representation that they expect to --

4            THE COURT: Why don't you confer on that at

5       lunch and try to get a firm answer on that.

6            MR. UITERWYK: As the Court is well aware,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=308
7       it's difficult to give a firm answer on time.

8            THE COURT: Well, I know. I know. But at

9       least -- at least you could -- you could tell him

10       what -- you can discuss the remainder of the

11        witnesses that you have and then get a ballpark

12       idea of when you anticipate resting.

13            You know, it's -- it is hard to estimate

14       counsel's cross-examination. And my guess is that

15       the defendants can give a reasonable approximation

16       of how long cross might be. And so working

17       together. I mean, it's in everybody's best

18       interests to have some sort of schedule in terms

19       of when the witnesses are going to appear and when

20       the plaintiff might rest and when you can have

21        defense witnesses and so forth. So the more

22       information that you give to each other, the

23       better it's going to be for all of you.

24            MR. WALKER: And, Your Honor, I need to

25       request that at some point, it seems clear to me 3124

1        that this trial is going to extend beyond the

2       estimate that was originally given to these

3       jurors. And I don't want that news to come to

4       them while we are in the middle of our case. I

5       would ask that Your Honor inform them.

6            THE COURT: Okay. I'll do that sometime next

7       week. I've already told them, because I

8       anticipated this, and, frankly, because it's true,

9       that the lawyers have been acting -- I've said it

10       I think more than once, that I've complimented the

11        lawyers on being very professional in representing

12       their clients and that any delay has not been

13       caused by any of the lawyers. So I will -- and

14       that -- and that's a true statement. But -- and I

15       don't always make that statement. So you have

16       been cooperating and I appreciate that, although

17       there have been snags. But it's a trial. That's

18       what happens.

19            But anyway, I will, if you will remind me

20       next week --

21             MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

22            THE COURT: -- when we have a better idea of

23       where we are going and how long it's going to

24       take, I can give them a better approximation. But

25       we're not, under any circumstance --1 have said 3125

1        this more than once -- if we need the full fourth

2       week, we are not going beyond that. So, you know,

3       we'll need to do whatever we can to get the case

4       done.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. And I believe the

6       defendants know quite well Dr. Cummings's

7       testimony as it relates to the documents that we

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=309
9       testimony. And these documents have been used on

10       a number of cases and have been admitted on a

11        number of cases prior to this particular case.

12            Because one of the things that happens,

13       Judge, you know, is I've got to go back and I've

14       got to go forward and it's --

15            THE COURT: You know, I can't make a blanket

16       ruling that defendants can't object, any more than

17       I can make a ruling that you can't object. I

18       mean, the objections are what they are. They--

19       they are entitled to rulings on them. And, you

20       know, they have been condensed in the sense that

21        these are William objections. And so I rule on

22       them. So they may want to challenge, as grounds

23       for appeal, all my Williams decisions. And that's

24       their prerogative.

25            So I think --1 think the better --it seemed 3126

1        to go a little bit more smoothly this morning on

2       it, and if you can cooperate on that, get a quick

3       lunch and work through some of the remaining

4       documents, I think we can be in a better position.

5       So I'll -- we'll be in recess until 1:30.

6            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

8            THE COURT: Any further discussion regarding

9       the exhibits or 

10            MR. WALKER: We spoke a little bit just after

11        the break, Your Honor, and we've --

12            THE COURT: You think maybe you can

13       categorize some as --

14            MR. WALKER: We have tried to do that. I

15       gave him a list of the documents as to which we

16       have authenticity objections.

17            THE COURT: Okay. Well, if you use the

18       shorthand method, so to speak, that you used

19       earlier today, I think we can move along.

20            MR. WALKER: I think that should work well,

4            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

5                CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Dr. Cummings, we were talking before the

8   break -- we started to talk about that we were going to

9   be talking this afternoon about the 50-year cover-up,

10   and you were going to show some documents and evidence

11    of that 50-year cover-up.

12            MR. UITERWYK: And what I want to do first is

13       offer into evidence, Your Honor, Exhibit No. 3068,

14       Survey of cancer research by Teague under tab 108

15       dated 2/2/53.

16            THE COURT: All right. Any objections?

17            MR. WALKER: Hearsay, lack of predicate,

18       relevance, 403.

19            THE COURT: Which predicate?

20            MR. WALKER: Lack of predicate for hearsay

21        exception.

22            THE COURT: Okay. All right. Sustained.

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   All right. Doctor, that's -- this document,

25   are you familiar with this document? 3136

1        A.   I am very familiar with it.

2       Q.   How are you familiar with it?

3       A.   Well, it came off the R.J. Reynolds website.

4   It's one of the many documents that was authored by

5   Dr. Claude Teague. It's essentially one of the first

6   of a series of research reports on the topic of smoking

7   and cancer that was done internally and published by

8   R.J. Reynolds. So it provides information as to

9   when -- what the companies knew and when they knew it.

10   Dr. Teague was in there --

11        Q.   I don't want to go to the document right now.

12       A.   Sure.

13       Q.   I want to overcome the objection and move on.

14       A.   Okay.

15            MR. UITERWYK: We would offer it, Your Honor.

16            MR. WALKER: Same objection.

17            THE COURT: Overruled.

18            (Exhibit PT3068 received.)

19            MR. UITERWYK: Next, I would like to offer

20       2061, PT2061, tab 109, Your Honor. A

21        Hill & Knowlton forwarding memorandum dated

22       3/29/1953.

23            MR. WALKER: Hearsay, authenticity,

24       relevance, 403, Your Honor.

25            THE COURT: Inasmuch as the document is 3137

1        authored by the same person, I will overrule the

2       objections.

3            (Exhibit PT2061 received.)

4            MR. UITERWYK: Next, Your Honor, I would like

5       to offer in evidence PT213.

6            MR. WALKER: Your Honor. I'm sorry. That

7       document is not -- there is no indication that

8       it's authored by the same person.

9            MR. UITERWYK: It's not authored by Claude

10       Teague, Your Honor.

11             THE COURT: Okay. I beg your pardon. This

12       is 109?

13            MR. UITERWYK: Yes, Your Honor.

14            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

15            MR. UITERWYK: 2061.

16            THE COURT: It says by Claude Teague.

17            MR. UITERWYK: You know what? We replaced

18       everybody's tab but his. We replaced everybody's

19       but yours, Judge.

20            THE COURT: Okay. Well --

21             MR. UITERWYK: Yeah.

22            THE COURT: I can only rule on what's -- what

23       I'm looking at.

24            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Sorry, Judge.

25       Sorry, Judge. May I approach? And I think we'd 3138

1       better -- I'm trying to get this done now, Your

2       Honor, rather than take the time during the course

3       of his testimony.

4            THE COURT: Here you are. All right. Lay a

5       predicate regarding this document.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   All right. How are you familiar with this

8   document -- are you familiar with this document,

9   Dr. Cummings?

10       A.   I'm familiar with this document in that it

11    comes from the archive of John Hill of Hill & Knowlton.

12   It was authored by Ed Dakin, and it is part of a

13   collection of materials from Hill & Knowlton and

14   minutes of meetings that were held in December of 1953.

15       Q.   Let's stop there. I think we've done a --

16            Your Honor, I would like to reoffer the

17       exhibit, 2061.

18            MR. WALKER: Same objection, Your Honor.

19            THE COURT: Okay. You'll have to lay a

20       better predicate regarding the author and time.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

22            MR. WALKER: And -- it's not evident.

23            MR. UITERWYK: All right.

24            THE COURT: From looking at -

25            MR. UITERWYK: I was trying to save time. 3139

1            THE COURT: Well, I know. But you still have

2       to-

3            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. I will go through it.

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   Who is -- first of all, who is

6   Hill & Knowlton and who is the guy who wrote it and

7   what was -- when was it written and about what does it

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=317
8   entail?

9       A.   Ed Dakin's initials are on page 3 of the

10   document. He was an executive for Hill & Knowlton. It

11    comes out of the archives of papers of John Hill, who

16   to as a forwarding memorandum dates from December 15th,

17   or references to people who were interviewed, and those

4       Q.   Okay. And this was shared with the other

5   people at the -- at the tobacco industry?

6       A.   Yes.

8       reoffer it.

9            MR. WALKER: Hearsay within hearsay, Your

11             THE COURT: All right. It will be received.

12            (Exhibit PT2061 received.)

17            THE COURT: Let me just make --1 didn't make

18       a note to myself. Where did we start just a few

19       minutes ago?

20            MR. UITERWYK: We started on tab 108, 3608,

21        Your Honor.

22            THE COURT: Okay. Let me just make some

23       notes. Okay. We're up to 110 now.

25       up to tab 110, tab number 110, PT2135. And I 3141

1        think I identified it.

3            THE COURT: 90.802.

15            MR. WALKER: Hearsay, 402, 403, and lack of

23            MR. UITERWYK: What predicate?

24            MR. WALKER: Oh, with respect to the use of

25       the document, Your Honor. 3142

1            THE COURT: Okay. Just lay a predicate

5   the document is and how you're familiar with it and

6   how -- you said use of it in connection with your

7   expertise in the field of smoking and smoking behavior.

8       A.   Again, this is another document from

9   Hill & Knowlton. This one is written by Richard

10   Darrow, who is another executive at Hill & Knowlton.

11    And it's summarizing a meeting of the tobacco

12   presidents, of the different cigarette company

13   presidents who met on December 28th, basically talking

14   about the public relations campaign that was kicked off

15   in early January. So this is December 28th. They kick

16   off the campaign on January 4th. They talk about how

17   it will be financed and what the elements of that

18   campaign will be.

19       Q.   Okay. And is this a document that you've

20   relied on in connection with your research of the issue

21    of the -- and the people who are in that expertise,

9       offer and introduce into evidence PT307, tab

10       No. 112. It's a TIRC - actually a publication

11        from the TIRC published called the Frank Statement

12       dated 1/1/1954.

13            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, the only objection

14       is Williams. But it's addressed by your earlier

15       ruling.

16            THE COURT: Okay. It will be received.

17            (Exhibit PT307 received.)

18            MR. UITERWYK: Next, Your Honor, I will offer

19       and introduce into evidence 2295, tab No. 113.

20            Unfortunately, Judge, we've got about 30 more

21        to go.

22            It's A Frank Statement to the -- it's a draft

23       of The Frank Statement that we just identified

24       dated 12/28/1953.

25            THE WITNESS: 26th. December 26th. I'm 3144

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   Dr. Cummings, are you familiar with this

10   document?

11        A.I am.

12       Q.   And are you familiar also with the

13   handwritten -- first of all, quickly, what is the

14   document?

15       A.   The document is A Frank Statement to the

16   public, which is an ad that was drafted and presented.

17   It was drafted on December 26th and presented to the

18   presidents of the company who met on December 28th.

19   And the handwritten edits are the edits that came from

20   the meeting with the presidents of the cigarette

21    companies on the 28th of December. And then the ad,

22   the actual ad appeared --

23       Q.   Where did you obtain this record from?

24       A.   This comes from the archives of

25   Hill & Knowlton. 3145

1            THE COURT: Are the edits reflected in the

2       previous exhibit?

4       previous exhibit in terms of what things were

5       taken out, is reflected in the previous exhibit.

14            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, next I would like

15       to offer into evidence 1689, which is tab No. 114.

16       You're not going to be able -- it's a video, Your

17       Honor.

18            THE COURT: All right.

19            MR. UITERWYK: An interview of Dr. Hartnett

20       on TV, Frank DuPuis.

21             MR. WALKER: The only objections are the ones

22       you've already addressed.

23            THE COURT: Okay. Same rulings and it will

24       be received.

25            (Exhibit PT1689 received.) 3146

10       is that?

11             MR. UITERWYK: It's not really a tab. It's a

12       video, Your Honor. It's 116.

13            THE COURT: I have tab 115, white paper demo.

14            MR. UITERWYK: This is 116, Your Honor.

15       Sorry.

16            THE COURT: So there is no 115?

17            MR. UITERWYK: That's a white paper demo.

18       It's going to be basically a demo that's going to

19       be shown.

20            THE COURT: Okay.  116 is the video clip?

21             MR. UITERWYK: Correct, Your Honor.

4       report to the Tobacco Industry Research Committee,

5       rather, April 28th, 1955.

6            MR. WALKER: Lack of predicate as to the

7       document, relevance, and 403.

8            THE COURT: All right. Lay a predicate with

9       respect to this document.

11       What predicate?

13            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=321
16   when was it generated?

17       A.   Yes. The Tobacco Industry Research Committee

18   was staffed by Hill & Knowlton, the public relations

19   company that was hired. There was a subcommittee

20   called the public relations committee. This is minutes

21    of their meeting summarizing their work up to that

22   point and their assessment of the smoking and health,

23   their work on that issue as of April of 1955. So it's

24   basically minutes of the public relations committee of

25   the Tobacco Industry Research Committee on 3148

1   Hill & Knowlton letterhead. It came out of the

2   archives, again, of John Hill. His archives, his

3   papers were turned over to the University of Wisconsin.

4       Q.   Is this something that you relied on in

5   connection with your opinions in the 50-year cover-up?

6       A.   It is.

7       Q.   Is this something you have both researched

8   and written on --

9       A.   It is.

10       Q.    regarding the 50-year cover-up?

11        A.   Yes.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I would like to

13       offer it again.

14            MR. WALKER: Hearsay. Lack of predicate as

15       to the author.

16            THE COURT: All right. Objections are

17       overruled. It will be received.

23            THE COURT: I have that as PT03694.

24            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

25            MR. UITERWYK: Sorry. My mistake. 3694. 3149

1        Read the wrong column.

2            THE CLERK: Thank you.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Next is tab No. 118, PT3612,

4       dated May 28, 1956. An RJR document. Analysis of

5       cigarette smoke condensate, one. Also prepared by

6       Rodgman, who we've heard from a few times already

7       in connection with the doctor's testimony.

8            MR. WALKER: 90.402 and 90.403, Your Honor.

9            THE COURT: Overruled. It will be received.

18       A.   Ed Darr, president of RJ. Reynolds, to Paul

19   Hahn, president of American Tobacco.

20            MR. WALKER: 90.402, the 90.403.

21             THE COURT: It will be received in evidence.

22       Overruled.

23            (Exhibit PT1608 received.)

24            MR. UITERWYK: Next, Your Honor, is PT3289,

1        American Tobacco Company report on their visit to

2       the USA and Canada. I would like to offer that

3       into evidence, Your Honor.

4            MR. WALKER: A couple of objections here.

5       Principally, multiple levels of hearsay. The

6       British American Tobacco Company is not affiliated

7       with any of the defendants in this case and was

8       not a defendant in the Engle case either.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Dr. Cummings, who did the British American

11    Tobacco Company visit?

12       A.   Well, they visited a number of the U.S.

13   tobacco manufacturers, Philip Morris, American Tobacco

14   Company. They came and visited with the scientists and

15   the principals of the Tobacco Industry Research

16   Committee, which the defendants are a part of, as well

17   as other scientists in the United States, about 41

18   people by my count.

19       Q.   All right. And does this reflect the results

20   of those interviews?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   And a report regarding those interviews with

23   the tobacco industry here in the United States, as well

24   as others?

25       A.   Correct. 3151

1            THE COURT: Who is the author of this?

2            THE WITNESS: The authors are three

3       scientists from British American Tobacco, with a

4       Mr. Bentley, Dr. Felton and Dr. Reed. They

5       represented the British American Tobacco Company,

6       Imperial Tobacco, which was their Canadian

7       affiliate. And Mr. Reed was from their South

8       African affiliate. And, of course,

9       Brown & Williamson is owned by British American

10       Tobacco.

11             THE COURT: All right. What are your

12       objections?

13            MR. WALKER: Multiple levels of hearsay.

14       Hearsay within hearsay within hearsay, Your Honor.

15       Not within an exception. It's not an admission.

16            THE COURT: Okay.

17            MR. WALKER: It doesn't meet any exception to

18       the hearsay rule.

19            THE COURT: All right. Sustained.

20            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Your Honor, I will

21        go back and establish the predicate on that.

22       Okay? Later on.

23            Next is a memo from Alan Rodgman to Kenneth

24       Hoover. Again, PT2141, tab No. 121, dated

25        11/2/59. 3152

1            MR. WALKER: 90.403 and 90.403, Your Honor.

2            THE COURT: Overruled. It will be received.

3            (Exhibit PT2141 received.)

4            MR. UITERWYK: Next is another Rodgman

5       document. And I'm marking it as PT3709A, tab

6       No. 122. I can identify it more, but -- if

7       necessary.

8            MR. WALKER: Authenticity, Your Honor, as to

9       the marginalia and relevance and 403.

10            THE COURT: All right. You'll have to lay a

11       predicate regarding the notes in the margin.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   All right. Are you familiar with this

14   document, Dr. Henningfield? Sorry. Dr. Cummings.

15       A.   Yes, I'm familiar with it.

16       Q.   And are you familiar with the notations that

17   are made on it?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   And how are you familiar with those

20   notations?

21        A.   Well, these were -- first of all, this

22   document came off the R.J. Reynolds website. And

23   the -- you know, on various documents, some of the

24   documents that are on that website have notations that

25   have been made. They appear to be notations making 3153

1    corrections to documents that were being in final

2   format.

3       Q.   And are we actually going to be referring to

4   any of the notations during the course of your

5   testimony?

6       A.   No.

7            THE COURT: All right. If you can redact the

8       notations, I will admit it. Otherwise, it's

9       objectionable.

10            MR. UITERWYK: We'll do that, Your Honor.

11             (Exhibit PT3709 A received.)

12            MR. UITERWYK: Next is a document, PT2378,

13       tab No. 123, is a Philip Morris document, Tobacco

14       and Health, an R&D Approach by Wakeham dated

15        11/15/61.

16            THE COURT: Any objections?

17            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. It's an

18       internal Philip Morris document. The objection is

19       hearsay. No foundation established for a hearsay

20       exception. 90.402 and 90.403.

21             THE COURT: All right. Pursuant to the Engle

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=324
22       findings, I'm going to admit it.

23            (Exhibit PT2378 received.)

24            MR. UITERWYK: Next is PT1524, tab No. 124,

25       dated 5/6/1963. A proposed letter to the Surgeon 3154

1        General. Hold on. From White and Case, addressed

2       to DeBaun Bryant at Brown & Williamson Tobacco

3       Corporation, signed by Jack Johnson.

4            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, the objection is,

5       first off, privileged. But there is -- to explain

6       the objection, I would need more than five words

7       as to this document and four others.

8            THE COURT: Okay. Why don't you approach.

9            (At the bench)

10            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, before we get into

11        that objection, among the many obstacles to

12       getting up is this easel on the board. I wonder

13       if -- Mr. Uiterwyk doesn't seem to be referring to

14       it. Can we move it?

15            MR. UITERWYK: Sure. I'm going to be

16       referring to it before the end of the day.

17            MR. PEDROSA: I think at some point, when you

18       do, you can--

19            THE COURT: You can move it.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Judge, during the break I

21        thought this has got to be the quickest way we can

22       get through this and get this done. Do you mind

23       telling the jury that this is -- sometimes we've

24       got to go over some technical issues, and that

25       we're going to be taking some time. And do you 3155

1        want to continue to do this in front of the jury?

2       What do you want to do?

3            THE COURT: How many more do you have?

4            MR. UITERWYK: What number am I at?

5            MR. WALKER:  124.

6            MR. UITERWYK: So I have got thirty-six left.

7            MR. WALKER: Thirty-six.

8            MR. UITERWYK: I had 150,1 think.

9            MR. WALKER: That would be 25 left.

10            MR. UITERWYK: That's why I practice law,

11       because I wasn't good at math.

12            MR. WALKER: No problem.

13            Your Honor, there are --

14            MR. UITERWYK: I think it's better, rather

15       than boring this jury going through this. They

16       see what's happening.

17            THE COURT: Well, does anybody object to the

18       jury being taken out while I rule on these?

19            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor.

20            MR. PEDROSA: No, sir.

21             (In open court)

22            THE COURT: All right. Members of the jury,

23       I have to go through another 25 exhibits, and it's

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=325
24       not really necessary that you sit here and listen

25       to me and the lawyers, so we'll be in recess for 3156

1        about another 15 minutes. Hopefully, we can

2       accomplish that in that period of time. Thank

3       you.

4            (The jury retired from the courtroom at

5       2:00 p.m.)

6            (At the bench)

7            MR. WALKER: I assume you don't want us up

8       here?

9            THE COURT: No.

10            (In open court)

11             THE COURT: You can be seated.

12            All right. What's the objection to PT1524?

13            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. I think that's

14       tab 124. This belongs to --

15            Your Honor, I don't know if it's appropriate

16       to have the witness still on the stand while we do

17       this.

18            THE COURT: Well, I guess -- if there are any

19       objections regarding --

20            MR. WALKER: We've already addressed all of

21        my authenticity objections.

22            THE COURT: To the remaining exhibits?

23            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. Because I --

24            THE COURT: Okay.

25            MR. WALKER: I think we -- didn't we go 3157

1        through all the authenticity?

2            MR. UITERWYK: I have no idea.

3            THE COURT: I mean, I don't want to call him

4       back and forth if you have authenticity and he has

5       to testify to that.

6            MR. WALKER: Okay. Well, these --

7            THE COURT: So if you advise me that there

8       aren't any, then I can let him --1 agree there is

9       no need for him to be here.

10            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, would it make sense

11        to just go through the authenticity objections?

12            THE COURT: That would be fine.

13            MR. WALKER: Okay.

14            MR. UITERWYK: Anything where we need him to

15       identify the predicate, with regard to predicate

16       and authenticity --

17            MR. WALKER: So the -- so I have these by

18       category, Judge. The next authenticity objection

19       that I don't believe has been addressed yet is

20        131.

21             MR. UITERWYK: For the record, Your Honor, it

22       is 3196, dated 11/20/1967, the Tiderock

23       Corporation report. Cigarette Controversy, an

24       Action Program.

25            THE COURT: I'm sorry. This is authenticity

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=326
3158

1        or predicate or both?

2            MR. WALKER: We're just talking about

3       authenticity, Your Honor.

4            THE COURT: Okay.

5            MR. WALKER: With respect to markings or

6       unsigned documents, documents that don't show a

7       recipient, documents that don't appear on

8       letterhead.

9            THE COURT: All right. Go ahead. Lay a

10       predicate.

11             MR. WALKER: So this document, No. 131, fits

12       into several of those categories. It has a number

13       of the markings. It's not clear who made them.

14       Most of the document -- I'm not sure anyone has

15       actually signed this document.

16            MR. UITERWYK: Dr. Cummings, are you familiar

17       with this document?

18            THE WITNESS: Yes. This document came off

19       the R.J. Reynolds website. Tiderock was the

20       company hired by The Tobacco Institute. And this

21        is a proposal that was submitted to The

22       Tobacco Institute in 1967. And elements that are

23       described in this particular proposal are, in

24       fact, executed. And my research has shown that

25       many of the items, including the production of 3159

1        white papers and production of magazine articles,

2       in fact, were undertaken by The Tobacco Institute

3       as a result of hiring the Tiderock Corporation.

4            MR. WALKER: Judge, Tiderock was not found to

5       be a co-conspirator. It has no corporation

6       relationship of successor or predecessor with any

7       of these defendants. And corporations don't write

8       articles. People do. Corporations don't make

9       edits in the margins. People do. And there is no

10       foundation as to who created and who edited this

11        document or where it was sent with these markings.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Was this a document that --

13       was Tiderock, in fact, employed by the TIRC?

14            THE WITNESS: They were employed by The

15       Tobacco Institute, which was funded and overseen

16       by the defendants in this case.

17            MR. UITERWYK: And The Tobacco Institute,

18       not only with -- but were there the heads of the

19       executive committee, were there heads of some of

20       the corporations?

21             THE WITNESS: Yes, it was.

22            MR. UITERWYK: And were the -- was there

23       counsel, committee, or a committee of counsel as

24       well that was the general counsel from the

25       corporations that were involved in? 3160

1           THE WITNESS: Correct.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=327
2            MR. UITERWYK: And was Tiderock involved in

3       the publicity that was being done by The

4       Tobacco Institute?

5            THE WITNESS: Yes. They were an agent of The

6       Tobacco Institute.

7            MR. UITERWYK: And did they, in fact, issue

8       documents at the request of The Tobacco Institute

9       and were paid by The Tobacco Institute and were

10       retained by The Tobacco Institute in connection

11        with the documents to create these documents and

12       distribute them throughout as part of the program,

13       the PR program that was instituted by The

14       Tobacco Institute, including the council of

15       committee as well as the executive committee and

16       heads of the companies?

17            THE WITNESS: Yes. The budgets for The

18       Tobacco Institute were approved by the presidents

19       of the cigarette manufacturers, including the

20       defendants.

21             MR. WALKER: So we've heard testimony about

22       who Tiderock is, but we haven't heard any

23       testimony about who wrote this document and who

24       made these markings in the margins and to whom, if

25       anyone, this actual document was sent. 3161

1            MR. UITERWYK: I don't think we need to

2       identify that, who wrote it. It's a Tiderock

3       document.

4            THE COURT: Okay. I can't admit the document

5       with the edits on it, because there is no way to

6       tell who wrote it.

7            MR. UITERWYK: All right. I will take--1

8       will remove the edits.

9            Do you need the edits in connection with your

10       testimony, Dr. Cummings?

11             THE WITNESS: No.

12            THE COURT: Okay. Well, provided the edits

13       in the margin, and wherever they appear, are

14       redacted, I will receive it in evidence.

15            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. And I

16       understand you to be overruling my hearsay

17       objection.

18            THE COURT: lam.

19            MR. WALKER: Without an author, we don't

20       believe that a hearsay exception can be

21        established.

22            MR. UITERWYK: Next authenticity?

23            MR. WALKER: Next is 135.

24            MR. UITERWYK: You didn't tell me about that

25       one. 3162

1            All right, Your Honor. It is PT718, tab

2       No. 135.

3            MR. WALKER: Actually, there are two

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=328
4       objections to this.

5            MR. UITERWYK: I haven't identified it yet.

6            MR. WALKER: You just read it.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah.

8            THE COURT: What number, sir?

9            MR. UITERWYK: PT -- sorry. Tab No. 135,

10       PT718, dated 11/3/69, entitled Smoking and Health

11        Proposal.

12            THE COURT: Okay. What are the objections?

13            MR. WALKER: Well, first of all, the date

14       that Mr. Uiterwyk just read, that belongs to the

15       document that begins on, it looks like, page 6 of

16       this exhibit. The first five or six pages are

17       undated and unsigned.

18            MR. UITERWYK: Actually, let me trade that

19       out. Okay? I think -- what happened is a

20       photocopying error here, Your Honor. And

21        unfortunately, as you know --

22            The actual document, I think, starts --

23            Dr. Cummings, where does the actual document

24       start?

25            THE WITNESS: Which one are you asking about? 3163

1            MR. UITERWYK: I'm asking about the Smoking

2       and Health Proposal, Exhibit PT718, tab 135. If

3       you will look at the back of it, I think that's

4       about six or seven pages down there.

5            Is that the entire document?

6            MR. WALKER: It looks like three documents in

7       one. If you move past the first six pages, it

8       looks like there is three documents here.

9            MR. UITERWYK: I'm asking Dr. Cummings. He's

10       the one that knows.

11             THE WITNESS: Yes. This is a -- the cover

12       page of this document, is listed on PT007180007.

13            MR. UITERWYK: All right.

14            THE WITNESS: And that is the cover page.

15       And this was a report to Brown & Williamson,

16       including members of Brown & Williamson --

17            THE COURT: Well, I don't have that cover

18       page.

19            MR. UITERWYK: What actually happened, Your

20       Honor, is the pages got mixed up.

21             THE COURT: Well, give me an exhibit that I

22       can look at where the pages are in the proper

23       order --

24            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

25            THE COURT: -- so I can make an intelligent 3164

1        ruling.

2            MR. BIGGER: I think what he's trying to say,

3       Your Honor, is that if you look at the Bates

4       numbers of when this document was produced, it was

5       produced jumbled. If you see the Bates numbers

6       that are vertical --

7            THE COURT: Just put -- put it in the order

8       that it's supposed to be in.

9            MR. BIGGER: That it should appear; okay.

10            THE COURT: And show it to Mr. Walker so he

11        can have an exhibit that he can read from.

12            MR. UITERWYK: May I approach the witness,

13       Your Honor?

14            THE COURT: (Nods affirmatively).

15            MR. UITERWYK: Is this the proper order?

16            THE WITNESS: No.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Is it three

18       documents --

19            THE WITNESS: Yes.

20            MR. UITERWYK: --within one?

21             THE WITNESS: Yes.

22            MR. UITERWYK: I think I have it. What goes

23       first?

24            THE WITNESS: I believe that's the order.

25            MR. UITERWYK: Let me give you the order. 3165

1            PT18 is first. PT19--not PT. Bates

2       stamped 18 is first, Bates 19 and Bates 20 and

3       then Bates 21. And then it's followed by Bates 7

4       through 18. And then it's followed by Bates 2

5       through 6.

6            And I apologize for the mixup there, Your

7       Honor.

8            MR. WALKER: Is this being offered as a

9       single document?

10            MR. UITERWYK: It is.

11             THE COURT: All right. What--what are the

12       objections?

13            MR. WALKER: The reordering helped somewhat,

14       Your Honor.

15            I still have authenticity objections to the

16       document. I'm not sure how I can identify the

17       page to you, Your Honor. It's the one that ends

18       with Bates No. 9, has a number of the markings on

19       it. It's not clear to me who made them or what

20       they're supposed to mean.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, if there are

22       markings, we'll delete the markings prior to it

23       going to the jury.

24            THE COURT: All right. But the first

25       two-page document is authored by JWB. 3166

1            THE WITNESS: J.W. Burgard.

2            THE COURT: Pardon me?

3            THE WITNESS: J.W. Burgard was involved with

4       one of the advertising companies for -- that

5       represented Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.

6            THE COURT: Okay. And the objectives -

7            Is this part of the same exhibit,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=330
8       Mr. Uiterwyk?

9            MR. UITERWYK: It is.

10            THE COURT: Okay. Are the objectives, the

11        two-page objectives, 1820 and 1821, are they

12       referred to or mentioned in the first two pages,

13       718-18 and 718-19?

14            THE WITNESS: Yes, they are.

15            THE COURT: They are.

16            THE WITNESS: Yes.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Where?

18            THE WITNESS: They - this was the - there

19       are basically -- what this document is about is

20       talking about creating a campaign to respond to

21        the health charges of -- that were coming out.

22            THE COURT: Does it make a reference to "see

23       attached objectives" or words to that effect? How

24       do I know by looking at the document that the

25       objectives is part of this two-page memo? 3167

1            THE WITNESS: Because on page 00097180009,

2       they talk about what the purpose of their meeting

3       is and to go over a proposal to develop a response

4       to the smoking and health issue. And those --

5       what they are talking about in terms of the

6       objectives of that campaign, which they're

7       describing, is listed on --

8            THE COURT: Okay. Read - page 2 of the JWB

9       memo.

10            THE WITNESS: Sure.

11             THE COURT: Read the sentence.

12            THE WITNESS: Read the sentence that I'm

13       referring to?

14            THE COURT: Yes.

15            THE WITNESS: Okay. Under smoking and health

16       proposal.  "What we want to do this morning" --

17            THE COURT: No, I don't see that.

18            THE WITNESS: On page 0009.

19            THE COURT: Okay. Hold up the paper you're

20       looking at?

21             THE WITNESS: The first paragraph.

22            THE COURT: No. I'm looking at - I'm

23       looking at --

24            MR. UITERWYK: The letter.

25            THE COURT: - at this letter from JWB. 3168

1            THE WITNESS: Okay.

2            THE COURT: And where in that letter does it

3       reference these -- these six objectives?

4            THE WITNESS: Sure. First sentence.  "I have

5       asked you to undertake a special assignment of

6       drawing up a proposed campaign to be conducted by

7       Brown & Williamson, which would bring the industry

8       side of the smoking and health controversy to the

9       attention of the general public."

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=331
10            So this is a meeting that they have in

11        August.

12            THE COURT: Right. But where does it say

13       that these are the objectives, the objectives that

14       are attached?

15            THE WITNESS: It does not say that in --

16            THE COURT: Okay. So these objectives are

17       out. I don't know whether or not it's part of the

18       same document. There is no way for me to tell

19       whether or not these two -- these objectives are

20       part of this document. I don't know what they're

21        referencing.

22            THE WITNESS: Well, they're referencing the

23       November --

24            THE COURT: I'm talking to the lawyers.

25            THE WITNESS: Okay. 3169

1            MR. BIGGER: Judge, the only thing we can say

2       is that the documents were produced in the order

3       they were kept in the regular course of business,

4       which is what this Bates number vertically here

5       represents. You asked Mr. Walker --

6            THE COURT: Well, you haven't laid that

7       foundation. I don't know that.

8            MR. BIGGER: Which is what -- I'm happy to

9       ask him. He, I believe, knows that these numbers

10       represent different defendants and different

11        unique numbers that were produced. We can perhaps

12       ask that. That would be of help.

13            MR. WALKER: He's already testified that this

14       document was pulled off the website. That's not

15       the manner in which --

16            THE COURT: Okay. I'm not going to admit it.

17       Just because somebody stamped them that way

18       doesn't mean they were part of it. So for all I

19       know, somebody just put them together.

20            MR. WALKER: The next document is 139, Your

21        Honor.

22            THE COURT: Well, no. I haven't --1 haven't

23       gone over this other document, which is --

24            MR. WALKER: Another part of 135?

25            MR. BIGGER: Yes. 3170

1            THE COURT: -- the next part of 135.

2            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, can we -

3            MR. WALKER: There are two other parts.

4            THE COURT: Okay.

5            MR. WALKER: It appears.

6            THE COURT: Is confidential with Items 1

7       through 7. And that two-page document, any

8       objections to that?

9            MR. UITERWYK: I'm not sure what we're

10       talking about, Your Honor. Sorry.

11             THE COURT: This two-page document, 18-007

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=332
12       and 18-008.

13            MR. WALKER: There is no -- there is no

14       authenticity objection to this document, Your

15       Honor. There will -- there are some other issues,

16       and I don't -- this document also fits into

17       another category. I don't know if we 

18            THE COURT: All right. Okay. Well, while

19       we're looking at it, what other objections do you

20       have?

21             MR. WALKER: The first, the document is a

22       privileged document. This is part of a series of

23       documents that were produced over a claim of

24       privilege. There was no determination that the

25       privilege was not valid. But they were produced 3171

1        to Congress as part of a Congressional subpoena.

2       The privilege objection was never waived and it

3       was never deemed to be invalid.

4            You can see in the first sentence what this

5       document is referring to is a document -- I'm

6       sorry.

7            THE COURT: Are these in the public domain?

8            MR. WALKER: I'm sorry?

9            THE COURT: Are these in the public domain?

10            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. But that

11        doesn't vitiate the privilege. The case law is

12       very clear. Because, for example, we will to come

13       to other documents that were stolen from a law

14       firm's offices and released into the public

15       domain. If the privilege--

16            THE COURT: But it's on your -- purportedly

17       it's on your website.

18            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. But the

19       documents were stolen. It's not on our website

20       because we just make documents available on the

21        website. There was -- there are documents that

22       are maintained on a website that were produced in

23       litigation. Documents can be produced in

24       litigation that aren't authentic, that -- for

25       which there are privilege objections. 3172

1             Some of these documents are documents as to

2       which a privilege objection was never overruled;

3       the privilege was never waived. The only reason

4       they're out there is because either they were

5       stolen, which some -- if somebody steals a

6       document out of my office and publishes it on the

7       Internet, I don't lose my privilege, nor does the

8       client.

9            THE COURT: Do you have any evidence that

10       this document was stolen?

11             MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor. This is not one

12       of the documents that was stolen. This is one of

13       the documents that was produced to Congress

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=333
14       pursuant to a subpoena, but without a waiver of

15       the privilege.

16            THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to overrule --

17       I'm going to overrule the objection.

18            MR. WALKER: May we ask for a redaction,

19       then, of the first paragraph that discusses

20       litigation? This is the same issue that gave rise

21        to our mistrial motion in this case. The

22       discussion about litigation surely is not relevant

23       to this lawsuit, and it should be redacted, at a

24       minimum.

25            I think we're just talking about 7 and 8 3173

1        right now.

2            THE COURT: Right.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Judge -

4            THE COURT: That request is denied.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. And, Your Honor, the

6       document that is in connection with 718 -- and the

7       reason we put it together, because it was given to

8       us together, we've had it together, it's been

9       always together. The document that we're going to

10       be showing to the jury is 718009 through 7180017.

11       We can withdrawal these other documents so we

12       don't have that confusion.

13            THE COURT: You know what? I'll tell you

14       what. If you guys -- if you were in federal

15       court, you would be out on your ear right now,

16       because federal judges don't put up with this.

17            Take back the document and at a break show me

18       the document that you want, because now you're

19       giving me different numbers.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Part of these documents --

21             THE COURT: No, I don't want to hear any more

22       of -- unless you can tie an attachment to the

23       document, then there is no way for me to tell

24       whether or not they are correlated. They may be

25       two separate documents somebody in a law office 3174

1       put together and said, You know what? I think

2       these documents are related, so let's put them in.

3       That doesn't make any sense.

4            Move on. Let's go.

5            MR. WALKER: The next document as to which

6       there are authenticity objections, Your Honor, is

7       No. 139.

8            THE COURT: Specifically what? The

9       underlinings?

10            MR. WALKER: Let me switch to that page, Your

11        Honor. Yes, Your Honor, the underlinings and the

12       markings.

13            MR. UITERWYK: We have no problem with that,

14       Judge. We'll remove them as we did previously.

15            THE COURT: Okay. All right.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=334
16            MR. WALKER: This is another document --

17       since we are on it, this is another document that

18       has references to litigation that we would ask to

19       be redacted if the document comes in. For

20       example, under No. 1 and No. 2 

21             THE COURT: All right. Let me look at this.

22            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. Plaintiffs

23       Exhibit 1913.

24            THE COURT: What's your response to this --

25       to this? 3175

1            MR. UITERWYK: Which particular line are you

2       referring to?

3            THE COURT: Well, to the litigation

4       privilege, that they are entitled to defend cases

5       as they see it, I guess.

6            MR. UITERWYK: This goes into the same area,

7       Your Honor, that we're talking about, that they're

8       claiming. These documents have been in the public

9       domain --

10            THE COURT: No, no. It's a different

11        objection. It's an objection regarding their

12       litigation strategy.

13            MR. UITERWYK: Which portions is he talking

14       about? That's what I want to know.

15            MR. WALKER: The third and fourth paragraphs

16       on the first page.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Actually, Your Honor, yeah.

18       It's actually, what they are doing here in

19       connection with this document is actually

20       suppressing research. And the law department was

21        getting involved in the suppression of the

22       research. But during the law department

23       orientation, he says he thinks it is safest for

24       the R&D to work on the development of a less

25       autogenic cigarette. He believes this is the 3176

1       prudent, responsible thing to do, but has been

2       told by lawyers, and Jacob, that he can't do this

3       work.

4            But the problem is, that's exactly what we

5       are talking about, is in a number of these

6       organizations, they were supposed to be

7       independent, they were supposed to do independent

8       research, and the lawyers got involved and said,

9       don't do this, don't do that.

10            And that was part of the concealment. At

11        some point in time, the lawyers were even charged

12       with part of the conspiracy.

13            MS. HUMPHRIES: That would be the Kessler

14       decision.

15            THE COURT: That would be the what?

16            MS. HUMPHRIES: I'm sorry for talking so

17       quickly. The Kessler decision, the federal

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=335
18       litigation, a lengthy opinion. It has -- devoted

19       a lot to what he's saying, explaining that.

20            MR. WALKER: Those were completely different

21        claims under a statute having nothing to do with

22       Engle.

23            It goes on, on page --1 guess it's the third

24       page of this document. There are more assertions

25       about what the lawyers are doing, what the 3177

1        lawyers' involvement has been.

2            THE COURT: I'm not -- I'm going to receive

3       it in evidence, subject to the underlinings and

4       highlighting being redacted.

5            (Exhibit PT1913 received.)

6            MR. WALKER: Is that without prejudice to the

7       use of the document, Your Honor, to objections

8       to-

9            I mean, if they're going to stand up and make

10       the type of argument that led to our mistrial

11        motion, I want to have the opportunity to object

12       to that.

13            THE COURT: You'll have an opportunity to

14       object.

15            MR. UITERWYK: What number was that again?

16            MR. WALKER: That's 139, Plaintiffs 1913.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Next?

18            MR. WALKER: There are only two more

19       documents as to which we have authenticity

20       objections. And they are near each other. It's

21        tab 146, which is plaintiffs 2583, and tab 148,

22       which is Plaintiffs 1809.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Just the handwriting on the

24       top?

25            MR. WALKER: No. The objection to the first 3178

1        is it's an unsigned document. It's not clear how

2       it was used, whether it was used, if it was

3       actually sent to someone.

4            And then for 148, that's also an unsigned

5       document -- at least the copy that we have -- with

6       markings at the top and no indication of where

7       this document came from or anything of that

8       nature.

9            THE COURT: All right. See if you can

10       authenticate PT2583.

11             MR. UITERWYK: Dr. Cummings, are you familiar

12       with tab No. 146, familiar with the statement by

13       William Kloepfer, senior vice-president of The

14       Tobacco Institute?

15            THE WITNESS: Yes. This is a copy of the

16       press release that was issued by The Tobacco

17       Institute.

18            MR. UITERWYK: And was the press release

19       actually issued?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=336
20            THE WITNESS: Yes. It was sent out by The

21        Tobacco Institute. And there was coverage with

22       the statements contained in it in newspaper

23       coverage.

24            MR. UITERWYK: And was it these statements in

25       the press that was in the document? 3179

1            THE WITNESS: Yes.

2            MR. UITERWYK: And did they actually quote it

3       as being from William Kloepfer from The

4       Tobacco Institute in connection with these press

5       releases --

6            THE WITNESS: I believe so, yes.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

8            THE COURT: All right. Your objections are

9       overruled. It will be received.

10            (Exhibit PT2583 received.)

11             MR. WALKER: That was No. 146, plaintiffs

12       2583?

13            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

14            MR. WALKER: The other document was tab 148,

15        1809, plaintiffs 1809.

16            THE COURT: And your objection is what, sir?

17            MR. WALKER: Authenticity as to this

18       document. It's an unsigned document with a number

19       of markings. It's not clear who made them. It's

20       not clear whether this is --

21             THE COURT: All right. Lay a predicate for

22       that, please.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Are you familiar with this

24       document, Dr. Cummings, PT1809? PM reports smoker

25       psychology program review? 3180

1            THE WITNESS: Yes. The smoker psychology

2       program was a program of Philip Morris tobacco

3       company. This document comes off the

4       Philip Morris website. The markings in the upper

5       right are from Bill Dunn, who was the director of

6       the human psychology program at Philip Morris, and

7       Tom Osdene, who was Dr. Dunn's boss.

8            THE COURT: Mr. Mayfield, is your firm

9       counsel in all the Hillsborough County cases?

10            MR. MAYFIELD: Yes, Your Honor.

11             THE COURT: I want -- in case I forget, I

12       want you to bring to the attention of any other

13       trial judge, that hindsight is always much clearer

14       than foresight, and that I think it would be

15       beneficial to hold hearings -- a hearing with the

16       witnesses who intend to identify these documents

17       way before trial so that we don't spend hours on

18       end going through this in the middle of trial. We

19       can have an authentication hearing on these

20       exhibits and spend however many days we need to go

21        through this, and would shorten the trial

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=337
22       dramatically.

23            Would you do me a favor? I'm going to make

24       that known to my brother and sister judges. But

25       in the event I fail to do that, I'm asking you to 3181

1        do that for me.

2            MR. MAYFIELD: I understand, Your Honor.

3       Yes, sir.

4            MR. BIGGER: Judge, you may not know, but I'm

5       plaintiffs' liaison counsel.

6            THE COURT: You can do that as well.

7            MR. BIGGER: I was going to say is after this

8       experience, I actually had the same thought as

9       Your Honor's. And what happens in other places,

10       we'll serve requests for admissions to admit the

11        authenticity, and any of those that are not

12       admitted, we'll have the necessary steps taken to

13       get these admission issues, foundation issues once

14       and for all for all the cases in Hillsborough

15       County.

16            THE COURT: Well, however.

17            MR. BIGGER: Your suggestion is very valid,

18       Your Honor.

19            MR. TRENTALANGE: Your Honor, may I say

20       something? May I say something?

21             THE COURT: Yes, sir.

22            MR. TRENTALANGE: This is extraordinary. You

23       asked me before whether --1 knew whether or not

24       of this type of thing with these many objections.

25            In my experience in every --1 have been in 3182

1        tobacco cases, but this is extraordinary. And

2       Your Honor has said a number of times that you're

3       not casting aspersions at the lawyers. Well,

4       with -- respectfully, this is a making of the

5       lawyers.

6            We had a bunch of records in our case that

7       were potentially harmful for us. Their theory is

8       that there is asthma. I could have objected to

9       every medical record that had the word "asthma" in

10       it and required the defense to bring the records

11        custodian so that they would satisfy predicates

12       for the hearsay and authenticity. But I didn't do

13       that, because I know they can satisfy those

14       predicates.

15            They know that we can satisfy these

16       predicates. This is a needless consumption of

17       time and resources. And it at least partially

18       accomplished its mission, because Your Honor a

19       moment ago made the statement about being in

20       federal court, and, you know, was legitimately

21        angry, and that anger got directed to the

22       plaintiff.

23            In this case, if a case drags out and it

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=338
24       looks like time is being wasted, the plaintiff,

25       who is bringing the case, is the one who suffers. 3183

1        This is a calculated effort, I fear, to make

2       people jump through hoops that they can be

3       satisfied with respect to many documents that this

4       defendant has seen before, that are originated

5       from the defendant, at least. These objections

6       are not being made in good faith.

7            THE COURT: All right. Well, I'm not going

8       to get into that.

9            MR. WALKER: I can respond to that if I need

10       to. If I need to, I would love to respond to

11        that.

12            THE COURT: Okay. I'm not going to get into

13       that.

14            MR. TRENTALANGE: Your Honor, I just want

15       to --

16            Trial Lawyer, section No. 11. A lawyer

17       should not -- a lawyer should accede to reasonable

18       requests for waivers of procedural formalities

19       when the client's legitimate interests are not

20       affected adversely.

21             That's a standard of professional courtesy

22       that has the same weight as calling her Ms. Loyd.

23       You're supposed to do that.

24            MR. WALKER: I would love to have a

25       conversation about professional courtesy in light 3184

1        of what happened with Dr. Feingold and

2       Mr. Heimann. If that's the conversation we're

3       going to have, I will be happy to have it.

4            THE COURT: All right. I don't want to get

5       sidetracked, because we have some -- we have time

6       constraints anyway.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Right. We were talking about

8       tab 148, PT1809, Your Honor.

9            THE COURT: With respect to getting angry at

10       plaintiffs counsel on that one exhibit, the

11        exhibit was a hodgepodge and it was misnumbered to

12       begin with.

13            MR. UITERWYK: We deserved everything we got.

14            THE COURT: Okay.

15            MR. UITERWYK: We deserved everything we got.

16       It was a hodgepodge.

17            THE COURT: Okay. Okay. Let's move on,

18       then.

19            MR. UITERWYK: I'm going to straighten out

20       the hodgepodge.

21             THE COURT: I accept your acknowledgement.

22            MR. UITERWYK: That's why, Judge, I have

23       tucked my tail between my legs.

24            MR. WALKER: Those are the objections that

25       are allegedly being made in bad faith, are two

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=339
3185

1        exhibits like that.

2            THE COURT: All right. Let's move on,

3       please.

4            MR. UITERWYK: All right. What else have you

5       got? Did we do 148, tab 148?

6            MR. WALKER: We started at-

7            THE COURT: No. I need--1 need a predicate

8       for these.

9            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Dr. Cummings, are you

10       familiar with this document?

11             THE WITNESS:  148?

12            MR. UITERWYK: Yes. 149. Sorry.  148.

13       You're right.

14            THE WITNESS: Yes. I'm familiar with that

15       document.

16            MR. UITERWYK: Tell the Court about it,

17       please.

18            THE WITNESS:  148 is -- came off the

19       Philip Morris website. It's describing the human

20       psychology program. The markings on it are two

21        employees of Philip Morris, Bill Dunn and Tom

22       Osdene. And so this is describing the work that,

23       in fact, was going on within the -- that program

24       and describing the basic theoretical model that

25       they were using to study human smoking behavior, 3186

1        which was a research program within Philip Morris.

2            THE COURT: Okay. And you say this -- the

3       author of this document was who?

4            THE WITNESS: It's not clear who the author

5       is.

6            THE COURT: Dr. -

7            THE WITNESS: There are --

8            THE COURT: I'm sorry. The name?

9            THE WITNESS: Dr. Bill Dunn and Tom Osdene

10       are listed on the front page in handwriting. Bill

11        Dunn was the director of the human psychology

12       program at Philip Morris.

13            THE COURT: Well, it says sent to Dr. Osdene,

14       Bill Dunn, 10/19/77.

15            MR. WALKER: The answer to Your Honor's

16       question was it's not clear who the author is.

17            THE WITNESS: Well, actually --

18            THE COURT: Okay. How can you determine who

19       wrote this document?

20            THE WITNESS: I can't be absolutely sure who

21        wrote it. It says Bill Dunn to Tom Osdene.

22            Tom Osdene was Bill Dunn's boss, and William

23       Dunn, Dr. William Dunn was the director of the

24       program that's described in the documents, smoker

25       psychology program. 3187

1           THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to keep it out.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=340
2       I can't tell from the document itself who the

3       author is. For all I know, Bill Dunn got a copy

4       of it and sent it on to the doctor and it was

5       authored by somebody else.

6            MR. UITERWYK: But, Your Honor, it's actually

7       a Philip Morris -- internal Philip Morris

8       document.

9            THE COURT: How can I tell that by looking at

10       it?

11             MR. UITERWYK: Because it was actually sent

12       to the guy who is the head of the department.

13            THE COURT: But it doesn't -- but that

14       doesn't mean that it was created by somebody from

15       Reynolds.

16            THE WITNESS: By Philip Morris.

17            THE COURT: Philip Morris. I beg your

18       pardon.

19            THE WITNESS: It did come off their website.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, if you look in the

21       body of the document --

22            THE COURT: Okay. Well, tell me.

23            MR. UITERWYK: "First, every undertaking has

24       to have some mission. I would state our charter

25       from Philip Morris in this fashion." And then he 3188

1        says "Our charter," the Philip Morris employee.

2            THE COURT: Okay. Well, I asked him, How can

3       you tell it's from Philip Morris? Who authored

4       it?

5            MR. WALKER: Actually-

6            THE COURT: Is Bill Dunn--what's his

7       position with Philip Morris at this time?

8            THE WITNESS: He was the director of the

9       human psychology program at Philip Morris Tobacco

10       Company. He was a scientist in their R&D program.

11             THE COURT: All right. That to me provides a

12       reasonable basis, so --

13            MR. WALKER: Your Honor's point is still

14       valid. It doesn't say Bill Dunn wrote it. It's

15       just a document where somebody wrote Bill Dunn and

16       Dr. Osdene at the top.

17            THE COURT: Okay. Well --

18            MR. WALKER: Our charter from Philip Morris

19       suggests that it's not -- that it's --

20            You know, you wouldn't expect to see that.

21             THE COURT: It appears to me to be a

22       Philip Morris document. I'm going to receive it

23       in evidence.

24            (Exhibit PT1809 received.)

25            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, that's the category 3189

1        of authenticity objections.

2            THE COURT: Okay.

3            MR. WALKER: There is a small category of

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=341
4       documents that relates to the litigation issue,

5       our ability to defend. There are three of those.

6            The first is --

7            THE COURT: All right. Can the witness be

8       excused?

9            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah.

10            THE COURT: I mean, step outside.

11             MR. BIGGER: Are there any more predicate

12       foundational issues? Let's establish that.

13            MR. WALKER: There are five documents as to

14       which we have hearsay objections, if 

15            THE COURT: Okay. I don't think we'll need

16       the witness for hearsay objections.

17            MR. WALKER: Otherwise, there are three.

18            MR. UITERWYK: Have a seat, Dr. Cummings.

19            MR. WALKER: There are three documents that

20       are white papers or some type of press release for

21        which there won't be a predicate that they were

22       actually disseminated to the public.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Which one are you talking

24       about?

25            MR. WALKER: That's 115, tab 115. 3190

1            THE COURT: Bailiff?

2            MR. UITERWYK: It's a demo. It's not going

3       to be offered.

4            THE COURT: Bailiff, do we have --1 don't

5       recall, do we have --1 don't recall if, in fact,

6       we do have smokers. Do we have smokers on the

7       jury?

8            MR. UITERWYK: We do. Two.

9            THE BAILIFF: I think we have two.

10            THE COURT: Okay.

11             MR. BIGGER: We started with two. We may

12       have more now.

13            MR. UITERWYK: Either that, or we may not

14       have two anymore. I'm not sure which.

15            THE COURT: More or less. I don't know.

16            MR. WALKER: Either way.

17            THE COURT: If they would -- it's going to be

18       longer than anticipated. If they would like to --

19            Have you allowed them to go outside and

20       smoke?

21             THE BAILIFF: Yes. When we have the time, I

22       allow them.

23            THE COURT: Okay. If they choose to do that,

24       I think we'll be another 15 minutes, so --

25            THE BAILIFF: Okay. Thank you. 3191

1            THE COURT: Not any longer than that, though.

2            MR. WALKER: I'm trying to do it by category,

3       Judge. Maybe it will help.

4             115 I'm told is -

5            THE COURT: Well, do you have any objections

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=342
6       to the witness being here in case --in case it

7       comes up?

8            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor.

9            THE COURT: Okay. Then if you don't mind,

10       stay seated.

11             MR. UITERWYK: It's more comfortable than the

12       bench outside, anyway.

13            THE WITNESS: Stay here?

14            THE COURT: Yeah.

15            THE WITNESS: Okay. I'm happy to stay.

16            MR. WALKER: Apparently 115 is a

17       demonstrative that we have not been provided, so I

18       don't know whether we have an objection to it or

19       not.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Here it is.

21             THE COURT: You haven't seen it yet?

22            MR. WALKER: No. I'm seeing it for the first

23       time now. I do object to these demonstratives.

24            THE COURT: Can I see it?

25            (A document was handed to the Court.) 3192

1            MR. UITERWYK: Here it is, Dr. Cummings.

2            THE COURT: What's the objection? The

3       objection?

4            MR. WALKER: The objection to the

5       demonstrative is I don't think these documents

6       should be shown if they're not going into

7       evidence. If they were to offer the documents

8       into evidence, we would object to the documents.

9            These -- these are examples of a series of

10       white papers which were not broadly disseminated

11        to the public. They were actually sent out to a

12       limited -- a limited subset of people to which

13       Jacqueline Loyd did not pertain.

14            So, for example, they were sent to

15       politicians. She was never a politician. They

16       were sent to doctors. She was never a doctor.

17       They were sent to other people in the government.

18       She was never in government.

19            THE COURT: Are these documents in evidence?

20            MR. UITERWYK: They are not, Your Honor.

21             THE COURT: Okay. The objection is

22       sustained.

23            MR. UITERWYK: I'll move - then we'll go

24       ahead and move -- we'll bring those documents and

25       move them in, Your Honor. 3193

1            THE COURT: Okay. For now, the objection is

2       sustained.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

4            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, the last of that

5       series is tab 147, which is plaintiffs 2510. The

6       objection is relevance. This is a document, it's

7       a press release that was prepared to be sent out

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=343
8       to the media. There is not going to be any

9       evidence in this case, certainly no document, that

10       shows that this press release was ever actually

11       picked up by any media outlet, and if so, how much

12       of it was. There won't be any document, and

13       certainly no document in this series that the

14       plaintiffs have provided, that shows that this

15       press release, as they want it to go into

16       evidence, was ever published in any newspaper, and

17       if so, what portions of it.

18            THE COURT: All right. Lay a predicate with

19       respect to PT2510.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Doctor, tab 147, are you

21        familiar with this document?

22            THE WITNESS: lam.

23            MR. UITERWYK: And it has on here Brennan

24       Moran contact and Walker Merryman. Who are they?

25            THE WITNESS: They were spokespeople for The 3194

1        Tobacco Institute that represented the

2       manufacturers. And this was a written press

3       release that was issued by The Tobacco Institute

4       following the issuing of the 1988 Surgeon

5       General's report. These two spokespeople that are

6       listed here as contacts appeared on national

7       television, giving essentially the exact same

8       statements that are contained in the press

9       release.

10            THE COURT: All right. Based upon his

11        testimony and the fact that the Engle findings and

12       the defendants' state of mind would be relevant to

13       conspiracy, I'm going to receive it in evidence.

14            (Exhibit PT2510 received.)

15            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

16            MR. UITERWYK: Tab 147. And that's 2510.

17            MR. WALKER: Next, Your Honor, there are a

18       series of three or four documents that relate to

19       the broader issue about litigation in the

20       documents. The first is tab 150. It's

21       plaintiffs 2184. This actually is the document

22       that --

23            THE COURT: Right.

24            MR. WALKER: -- caused the fuss in openings.

25            We object to the document coming in, but at a 3195

1        minimum would ask, as other courts have -- some

2       other courts have ruled, that the last two

3       sentences be redacted.

4            MR. UITERWYK: Every court in this

5       jurisdiction has let that document in, Your Honor.

6       Now, there have been some courts that have

7       redacted the words "Shook Hardy" and instead

8       required "our lawyers." Some courts have said

9       we're going to leave in Shook Hardy, particularly

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=344
10       those cases where Shook Hardy, who is the attorney

11        for Philip Morris --

12            MR. BIGGER: May we have a moment, Your

13       Honor?

14            THE COURT: Yeah.

15            (A pause was had in the proceedings.)

16            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

17            MR. UITERWYK: No.

18            THE COURT: I thought Mr. Bigger asked for a

19       moment.

20            MR. UITERWYK: We had a moment.

21             MS. HUMPHRIES: One more second.

22            MR. UITERWYK: Nothing, Your Honor.

23            THE COURT: Anything else? I saw counsel

24       conferring, both plaintiff and defense counsel

25       conferring. 3196

1            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, this is the

2       document, as you well know, that has been

3       publicized to the jury, No. 1.

4            Number 2, it's been let in. This document

5       has been let in in every case involved in this

6       jurisdiction. It's very much -- it's a Tobacco

7       Institute document.

8            THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to receive it in

9       evidence. I will admonish counsel again, don't

10       make a closing argument similar to the one you

11        made in opening statement. Okay?

12            MR. TRENTALANGE: Yes, Your Honor.

13       Understood.

14            THE COURT: If there is any question about my

15       ruling, please ask it now. But I don't want any

16       reference to these lawyers are following the same

17       pattern of deceit or conspiracy.

18            MR. TRENTALANGE: I do have a question --

19            THE COURT: Okay.

20            MR. TRENTALANGE: --and a concern. They

21        don't bring anybody to trial as a corporate

22       representative. If they had a person at the table

23       representing, as Mr. Walker put it in opening, and

24       I objected, the men and women of R.J. Reynolds, I

25       would be free to talk about the defendant if it 3197

1        were a human being, and I could stand at counsel

2       table and point to him. This is what they're

3       saying and they're denying it just like they

4       denied or just like he denied all along.

5            I think that's a completely proper argument

6       to say that they are still in denial, the

7       defendant.

8            If I gestured in that direction, it would

9       be -- if the person were here, it would be in the

10       direction of the person who is the defendant.

11             I don't want to be limited by their tactical

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=345
12       decision not to bring a human being to make that

13       argument and --

14            THE COURT: Okay.

15            MR. WALKER: Your Honor -

16            THE COURT: Well, all right. We can address

17       that when we get to closing.

18            MR. TRENT ALANGE: Right. I understand your

19       ruling.

20            THE COURT: Okay.

21             MR. TRENT ALANGE: I wanted you to know where

22       I-

23            THE COURT: We'll address that at closing.

24            MR. TRENTALANGE: Right.

25            THE COURT: Bring it up again. 3198

1             (Exhibit PT2184 received.)

2            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, the next in this

3       series is tab 137. It's plaintiffs 2050.

4            MR. UITERWYK: What number?  137?

5            MR. WALKER: Yes.

6            MR. UITERWYK: The Roper Proposal?

7            MR. WALKER: Yes. This is the other document

8       that caused what we believe to be part of the

9       problem in the opening. In particular, I'm

10       referring to the second paragraph that has

11        reference to litigation, and then the first

12       underlined paragraph that, again, refers to

13       litigation.

14            THE COURT: Okay. Your objection is

15       overruled.

16            (Exhibit PT2050 received.)

17            MR. WALKER: Judge, may we ask that the stamp

18       referring to Minnesota tobacco litigation be

19       redacted?

20            THE COURT: Yes.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Sure. Baron, can you do that?

22            MR. PHILIPSON: I already did it.

23            MR. UITERWYK: He already did it.

24            MR. WALKER: The next in the series, Your

25       Honor, is tab 129, plaintiffs 3550. 3199

1            This is another document that's discussing

2       lawsuits. We don't believe it's relevant. We

3       think it's unfairly prejudicial, particularly in

4       light of the issue that arose in opening. And an

5       example of that is on page 4 of this document,

6       Bates 5.

7            We ask that the document be excluded or at

8       least all references to litigation and lawyers be

9       redacted.

10            THE COURT: All right. Your objection is

11        overruled. It will be received.

12            MR. WALKER: Is the request for redaction

13       overruled, Your Honor?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=346
14            THE COURT: Where is the redaction?

15            MR. WALKER: On page 4 there is a whole

16       section that begins "lawsuits pending." And then

17       there is an extensive --

18            MR. UITERWYK: We'll redact it. We're not

19       going to publish that, Your Honor.

20            THE COURT: Well, I know. But it's going to

21        go back. So are you going to redact it?

22            MR. BIGGER: Respectfully, Your Honor, we

23       don't believe it's appropriate to be redacted

24       because part of the reason for the fraud finding

25       in Engle --3200

1            THE COURT: Okay.

2            MR. BIGGER: -- is it was protect- --

3            THE COURT: Okay. So the question was, Are

4       you going to redact it? The answer is no.

5            MR. UITERWYK: No, Your Honor.

6            MR. BIGGER: Yes, Your Honor.

7            THE COURT: Okay. So it will be received.

8            MR. BIGGER: Thank you.

9            MR. WALKER: Your Honor overruled my request

10       for redaction?

11             THE COURT: Correct.

12            MR. WALKER: Your Honor -

13            THE COURT: I mean, isn't there evidence that

14       the defendant knew that these cigarettes were --

15       that's what he's been testifying for two days --

16       that they knew that it was harmful; that they

17       purposefully put in nicotine to make it more

18       addictive; that they adjusted the cigarettes to

19       deliver.

20            There has already been an Engle finding of

21        conspiracy to conceal.

22            MR. UITERWYK: Conceal.

23            MR. WALKER: There is no finding about

24       litigation, Your Honor. And this--

25            THE COURT: Well, I know. But if the 3201

1        defendants -- if the defendants employ tactics in

2       trial that -- that they know to be false, if

3       you --

4            Let me see if I can create a hypothetical.

5            If you took the position today that nicotine

6       is not addictive and you were instructed to take

7       that position by the company in order to continue

8       to sell cigarettes --

9            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. There could be

10       no liability for that. There is -- there can be

11        no liability for that. There is a qualified

12       privilege in Florida law that is extensively --

13       there are five or six appellate opinions that say

14       the positions taken in litigation are subject to a

15       privilege, because, for the very reason you can't

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=347
16       have people defending themselves in litigation

17       only to have somebody come behind and say, well,

18       you said something in litigation that wasn't true.

19       There is a qualified privilege in Florida on that,

20       and there is extensive First Amendment cases on

21        that, that we would be happy to provide to Your

22       Honor.

23            THE COURT: Well, I'm not -- no, I'm not

24       asking for it.

25            MR. WALKER: But if I might, Your Honor, this 3202

1        discussion about how many lawsuits are pending has

2       no relation even to the concealment. The fact

3       that the companies may have known something, what

4       they did in a handful of lawsuits has nothing to

5       do with any concealment.

6            Your Honor's Williams ruling, if I understood

7       it, if it still applies, was that it has -- there

8       has to be some connection to something that was

9       disseminated to the public.

10            What was happening in 30 to 35 lawsuits at

11        some point in the -- whenever this was, has

12       nothing to do with anything that relates to

13       Ms. Loyd. If she -- she wasn't -- she wasn't --

14       she wasn't a party to any of these lawsuits.

15            So this discussion about what was being done

16       in lawsuits has no relation to her of any kind.

17       She was neither a defendant nor a plaintiff. This

18       isn't like marketing to the public.

19            THE COURT: Where is that?

20            MR. WALKER: That's on page 4 under the

21        heading Lawsuits Pending. Some 30 to 35 lawsuits

22       have been moving recently, including some which

23       have been dismissed.

24            THE COURT: Well, this is in 1964.

25            MR. WALKER: It is, Your Honor. Of these 30 3203

1        to 35, 15 have been filed since publication of the

2       Surgeon General's report. Reynolds has been

3       served with nine suits in eight months.

4            That has nothing to do with this.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I will save time,

6       because I really want to get Dr. Cummings off, but

7       I'm not going to be able. I will go ahead and

8       agree to redact the section on the lawsuits

9       pending. I don't have any problem with that, Your

10       Honor, up to page -- up to page 4, 5, 6, up to

11       page -- influence -- but influence of the lawyers

12       on, I definitely want that in there.

13            MR. WALKER: That section beginning, In

14       consequence of the importance of the lawsuits.

15       And it goes on from there.

16            MR. UITERWYK: They talk about the influence

17       of the lawyers on a lot of the actions that the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=348
18       cigarettes companies were taking, Your Honor.

19            MR. BIGGER: The rest of that sentence says,

20       The main power in the smoking and health situation

21        undoubtedly rests with the lawyers, and more

22       particularly with the policy committee of lawyers.

23            THE COURT: All right. I'm going to admit

24       it. I'm going to admit it subject to the

25       redactions that plaintiffs are making. 3204

1             (Exhibit PT3550 received.)

2            MR. UITERWYK: We'll redact page 4 -- Bates

3       stamped, rather, Bates stamped 5, middle of the

4       page starting with the lawsuits -- yeah. I need

5       to know. For the record, 07, Bates stamped, up

6       through to visit of UK, the Green case.

7            MR. WALKER: The last in this series, Your

8       Honor, is plaintiffs 2181. This is actually a

9       document that Your Honor addressed earlier, but we

10       need to ask for a redaction.

11             MR. UITERWYK: What tab is that?

12            MR. WALKER: Sorry?

13            MR. UITERWYK: Tab.

14            MR. WALKER: I think it's 79. There is a

15       statement in the sentence that says, Once it

16       becomes clear that such action is necessary for

17       the successful defense of our present and future

18       suits, we will promptly remove all such reports

19       from our files.

20            We are just asking for the redaction of the

21        reference to defense of present and future suits.

22            MR. UITERWYK: That goes to the core of that

23       document, Your Honor.

24            THE COURT: What number is that?

25            MR. UITERWYK: Tab No -3205

1            MR. WALKER: Seventy-nine.

2            MR. UITERWYK: What is it? Seventy-nine?

3            MR. WALKER: It's 79. The document was

4       addressed in the context of other objections, but

5       not --

6            THE COURT: Seventy-nine?

7            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

8            MR. UITERWYK: Tabs.

9            THE COURT: We're going backwards.

10            MR. BIGGER: It's in evidence, Your Honor.

11             MR. WALKER: This is the only document, Your

12       Honor, that, for whatever reason, I didn't see a

13       clear ruling on whether this could be redacted.

14            THE COURT: I thought I ruled on this

15       already.

16            MR. UITERWYK: You did, and you admitted it

17       with no restrictions.

18            MR. WALKER: You ruled on the document, Your

19       Honor, but you didn't rule on the request for

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=349
20       redaction in the second sentence. It doesn't

21        change the nature of the document, but it does

22       prevent us --

23            THE COURT: And you want redacted -- I'm

24       sorry, Mr. Walker -- what page?

25            MR. WALKER: The second sentence says, 3206

1        "Defense of our present and future suits." We

2       would ask that that -- or "successful defense of

3       our present and future suits." We would ask that

4       that would be redacted.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I have got to go

6       back to the other binders. It actually goes more

7       on the document, Your Honor, because this is

8       talking about --

9            THE COURT: Mr. Walker, can you approach,

10       please, with your document?

11             MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

12            (A document was handed to the Court.)

13            THE COURT: Oh, okay.

14            MR. UITERWYK: I won't step back up, Judge.

15            THE COURT: Okay. Your request is denied.

16            MR. WALKER: The document has already been

17       received.

18            THE COURT: There is a request for redaction.

19       The document has already been received in

20       evidence. His request for redaction is denied.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

22            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, there are a couple

23       of exhibits that they have listed that don't fit

24       neatly into any category, but I think we can

25       address them relatively quickly. 3207

1            THE COURT: Okay.

2            MR. WALKER: The first is No. 149, tab 149.

3       This is Plaintiffs Exhibit 1771.

4            THE COURT: Yes.

5            MR. WALKER: This is a video that was -- of

6       coverage of a Congressional hearing. The

7       Congressional hearing was televised on CSPAN in

8        1994 after Ms. Loyd had already quit smoking.

9       There is no other example of similar testimony at

10       any prior point in the case that relates to

11        Ms. Loyd, and so we believe it's irrelevant and

12       should be excluded under 403.

13            It's also privileged. When a company or an

14       individual makes their views known to Congress,

15       that is protected activity. It's protected under

16       the First Amendment. It's protected by the

17       qualified privilege law here in Florida that I

18       mentioned. And so we object on those grounds as

19       well.

20            THE COURT: So hypothetically, people can

21       present -- can, with immunity, perpetrate frauds

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=350
22       on the Court and with immunity?

23            MR. WALKER: Your Honor -

24            THE COURT: Is that what you're telling me?

25            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor. I'm telling you 3208

1        that when a defendant in litigation takes a

2       position that's calculated to win the case --

3            THE COURT: Regardless of what the evidence

4       is?

5            MR. WALKER: Every defendant has a right --

6            THE COURT: If a defendant knows--if a

7       defendant knows that nicotine is addictive, and

8       all their documents say that, and we -- and then

9       the defendants say, You know what? We're going to

10       hide this fact. We're going to bury this fact,

11        and anything we have in our files, we're going to

12       destroy. And moreover, we're going to tell our

13       lawyers to employ the strategy that nicotine is

14       not addictive.

15            And you're saying --

16            MR. WALKER: I'm saying if you -

17            THE COURT: --that they can do that with

18       immunity.

19            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor. I'm saying if

20       you spoliate evidence, the law deals with that.

21        If you perjure yourself in court, the law deals

22       with that.

23            THE COURT: But the lawyers can take whatever

24       tactic they want?

25            MR. WALKER: One person cannot sue another 3209

1       person for a position that they have taken in

2       litigation. There can be no liability for taking

3       a position in litigation.

4            THE COURT: Okay.

5            MR. WALKER: Florida law is very, very clear

6       about that.

7            THE COURT: All right. Well, I'm allowing -

8            MR. WALKER: This doesn't address that part.

9            THE COURT: I'm not going to get off on a

10       tangent. I've got enough to say grace over.  149

11        is admitted.

12            (Exhibit PT1771 received.)

13            MR. UITERWYK: Amen, Judge.

14            MR. WALKER:  136. And, Your Honor, I think

15       to rule on this one, you need to see it. This is

16       an incredibly inflammatory --

17            THE COURT: Which one, sir?

18            MR. WALKER: Thi is tab 136. It's actually a

19       video clip. It's Plaintiffs 1780.

20            THE COURT: Okay. Can you bring it up?

21             MR. UITERWYK: By way of background, yeah,

22       right, I think we need to lay a foundation so the

23       Court can get a perspective of how this came

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=351
24       about.

25            Can you explain, first of all, who 3210

1        this Cullman is? I get mixed up.

2            THE WITNESS: Yes. Joseph Cullman was the

3       president of Philip Morris. He was also the

4       chairman of the Tobacco Institute executive

5       committee, which was a committee of all the

6       presidents of the companies that ran The Tobacco

7       Institute. He appeared on the show "Face The

8       Nation" in January of 1971, because cigarette ads

9       had come off of broadcast at that point.

10            THE COURT: You said he was chairman of which

11        institute?

12            THE WITNESS: He was the chairman of The

13       Tobacco Institute executive committee. So he was

14       there representing --in fact, in the introduction

15       of Mr. Cullman on the show, it actually says he is

16       representing the members of The Tobacco Institute.

17            THE COURT: Okay.

18            MR. UITERWYK: Let me - before you start,

19       this document or this video is being shown because

20       The Tobacco Institute, as well as the tobacco

21        companies, are taking the position during this

22       time that is contrary to what's shown in

23       television --

24            Tell the judge what position they are taking

25       that is contrary to what --3211

1            MR. WALKER: None of this is relevant to my

2       objection, Your Honor.

3            THE COURT: Okay. All right. Your voice

4       trailed off. Did you get it?

5            (The reporter requested a repetition.)

6            MR. UITERWYK: - they took at the time that

7       was contrary to what was shown in this video.

8            THE COURT: All right. Play the video,

9       please.

10            (A video clip was played for the jury as

11        follows:)

12            SPEAKER 1: From CBS Washington, in color,

13        "Face The Nation," a spontaneous and unrehearsed

14       news interview with Joseph Cullman III, chairman

15       and chief executive officer of Philip Morris Inc.,

16       and chairman of the executive committee of The

17       Tobacco Institute.

18            MR. CULLMAN: We have no program that I know

19       of to try to help people to stop smoking. We --

20       we do talk to the question of whether or not

21        cigarettes are hazardous. We do not believe that

22       cigarettes are hazardous. We don't accept that.

23       And that this industry can face the future with

24       confidence because when, as and if any ingredient

25       in cigarette smoke is identified as being

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=352
3212

1        injurious to human health, we are confident that

2       we can eliminate that ingredient.

3            I would say that I did read that report, and

4       I conclude from that report that it's true, that

5       babies born from women who smoke are smaller, but

6       they're just as healthy as the babies born from

7       women who do not smoke.

8            SPEAKER 1: What about the higher risk of

9       deaths?

10            MR. CULLMAN: And some women prefer having

11        smaller babies.

12            SPEAKER 1: How about the higher rate of

13       deaths?

14            MR. CULLMAN: I'm not familiar with that.

15       End class membership clip.

16            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, may I state may

17       objection? Which I haven't actually had a chance

18       to do that yet.

19            The objection -- we do have an objection to

20       the relevance of this clip. But Your Honor has

21        already addressed that with your Williams ruling.

22            My objection is to the unfair prejudice of

23       the inflammatory part they attached onto the end

24       of that about smaller babies. This will probably

25       be the first, perhaps the only time in this entire 3213

1        trial that the plaintiffs will ask you to disagree

2       with an evidentiary ruling that Judge Pendino

3       made, because Judge Pendino excluded that portion

4       of this clip in the Betty Faye Allen case. And

5       that's what I'm asking.

6            In terms of our additional objections over

7       and above what we've already discussed, my request

8       is that that inflammatory comment about smaller

9       babies at the end of that clip be removed, just as

10       Judge Pendino ordered.

11             THE COURT: What is it relevant to?

12            The first, you're not objecting to the first

13       part?

14            MR. WALKER: Not other than what we've

15       already discussed, Your Honor, no.

16            THE COURT: Okay. Well --

17            MR. UITERWYK: It's the position -- it shows

18       the position and the attitude that these companies

19       are taking with respect to the dangers to health

20       as it relates to smoking and the health effects as

21        it relates to smoking. They have made --

22            MR. TRENTALANGE: One second. Excuse me.

23            MR. UITERWYK: And one of the issues in this

24       case has actually been -- she did smoke when she

25       was pregnant. Mrs. -- and she was pregnant when 3214

1       this occurred, this film. It was actually before

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=353
2       this film occurred.

3            THE COURT: Is there going to be evidence of

4       that?

5            MR. UITERWYK: That she was what? Not when

6       this film occurred. She wasn't pregnant then.

7            THE COURT: No, no, no, no. Is there going

8       to be evidence that she smoked while she was

9       pregnant?

10            MR. UITERWYK: Correct.

11             MR. TRENTALANGE: There is one pregnancy then

12       when she didn't smoke, but she smoked during her

13       other pregnancies.

14            MR. WALKER: There will be no evidence that

15       she saw this video, Judge. They are not showing

16       it because it has some relationship to Jacqueline

17       Loyd. They are showing it because they think

18       people are going to be angry --

19            THE COURT: Yeah. But it would harm people

20       that would be in the same class as she was in. So

21        I'm going to allow it provided there is -- there

22       is testimony. You're making a good faith

23       representation to the Court that there is

24       testimony, there will be testimony that she smoked

25       during one of her pregnancies. 3215

1            MR. TRENTALANGE: Yes, sir. The testimony is

2       that she refrained from smoking while she was

3       pregnant with her daughter Amber. While she was

4       pregnant with her other children, she did smoke.

5            THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to allow it.

6            MR. UITERWYK: What number is that, 136?

7            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I just need to add,

8       I'm not sure there is going to be that testimony.

9       And if that clip gets played and that testimony

10       doesn't come in, I'm going to be back asking for a

11        mistrial.

12            THE COURT: Well, that's why I made sure that

13       it is.

14            MR. TRENTALANGE: I'll tell you what --

15            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I just don't want

16       there to be any confusion.

17            THE COURT: I'm not saying I'm granting it.

18            MR. WALKER: I know.

19            THE COURT: There is a lot of hoops we've got

20       to go through. I understand your objection. And

21       plaintiffs counsel has made a representation, and

22       I don't handle -- and I'm making a ruling based on

23       that.

24            MR. WALKER: I'm mostly saying it for the

25       benefit of those all here, because sometimes when 3216

1        things are getting argued, we say things to get

2       beyond the particular issue. I just want to make

3       sure --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=354
4            MR. TRENTALANGE: Judge, I want to make sure

5       we don't have testimony that was objected to on

6       whether or not she smoked, because, obviously,

7       she's deceased.

8            THE COURT: Yeah.

9            MR. TRENT ALANGE: So she's not going to be

10       able to tell us yes. So it is probably going to

11       be hearsay testimony. For them to object to

12       hearsay about what she did and keep it out that

13       way and then say, There is no basis for it to come

14       in, that poses a problem.

15            MR. WALKER: Me objecting to hearsay poses a

16       problem, Judge.

17            MR. TRENTALANGE: There is a good faith

18       basis, because we have a good faith belief -- a

19       good faith belief doesn't have to be based upon --

20            THE COURT: Okay. Make the--before I make

21        the ruling, make the proffer.

22            MR. TRENTALANGE: I believe that Cindy is

23       going to testify that, based on what she knows

24       about her mother's history, that she smoked while

25       she was pregnant. 3217

1            THE COURT: Is she going to testify that she

2       knew that -- Ms. Evers has a sibling?

3            MR. BIGGER: Correct.

4            THE COURT: And how many years apart are

5       they?

6            MR. TRENTALANGE: Correct.

7            THE COURT: How many years apart are they?

8            MR. TRENTALANGE: It's complicated.

9            THE COURT: There is another father?

10            MR. TRENTALANGE: I'm sorry?

11             THE COURT: It's complicated because there

12       was a different father?

13            MR. TRENTALANGE: Correct.

14            THE COURT: Okay.

15            MR. TRENTALANGE: But there are sisters that

16       are either sisters or half sisters.

17            THE COURT: Okay. But there is a difference

18       between knowing when your mother is pregnant when

19       you're a year old versus knowing when your mother

20       is pregnant at maybe five years old.

21             MR. TRENTALANGE: Right. And for Amber,

22       there is -- there is testimony from Vicki Gilmore,

23       who was 16 at the time -- and she specifically

24       remembers that pregnancy -- and she remembers her

25       mother having a lot of the morning sickness during 3218

1        that pregnancy and not smoking because she was too

2       sick.

3            MR. WALKER: Not smoking. Not smoking.

4            MR. TRENTALANGE: That's what I said. So

5       that's in contradistinction to her other

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=355
6       pregnancies where she had morning sickness and

7       didn't refrain from smoking.

8            THE COURT: Is there somebody going to

9       testify that she knew that Ms. Loyd was pregnant

10       and also knew that she didn't smoke during the

11       pregnancy?

12            MR. TRENTALANGE: Yeah. But it's going to be

13       hearsay, because the only way she will know is

14       that her mother --

15            THE COURT: Well, she may have been in

16       Ms. Loyd's presence and on multiple occasions and

17       saw -- and observed her refraining from smoking.

18            MR. WALKER: That's why I raise the issue,

19       Judge, because that evidence, I don't --1 don't

20       know where it's coming from.

21             MR. TRENTALANGE: There is not going to be

22       anybody that has personal knowledge of it with the

23       possible exception of one witness, and I can't

24       confirm or deny that.

25            THE COURT: Well, you may have a good faith 3219

1       belief that it happened, but I think you have to

2       have -- it is inflammatory.

3            MR. TRENTALANGE: Right.

4            THE COURT: And -

5            MR. TRENTALANGE: Can we have a minute,

6       Judge? We don't want to create error.

7            THE COURT: If there is not admissible

8       evidence, then you have a problem.

9            MR. TRENTALANGE: Right. Can I confer with

10       my client too?

11             THE COURT: Yes, yes.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Can we leave the courtroom for

13       a moment, Judge?

14            THE COURT: Pardon me?

15            MR. UITERWYK: So we can talk with our client

16       for a moment?

17            THE COURT: Okay.

18            MR. BIGGER: In the witness room.

19            THE COURT: Okay.

20            (A recess was taken at 3:08 p.m.)

21             MS. HUMPHRIES: We're taking a moment to

22       confer with one of the witnesses, Your Honor.

23            (Discussion off the record.)

24            MS. HUMPHRIES: We're on the phone with two

25       witnesses right now, Your Honor. 3220

1            THE COURT: I didn't realize you were

2       contacting your witnesses.

3            MS. HUMPHRIES: We want to be very careful

4       with our good faith representation.

5            THE COURT: Well, I would think so.

6            Ms. Humphries, you're familiar --1 just

7       recalled something. I'm not going backwards. But

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=356
8       defense counsel's argument regarding privilege

9       for, not attorney-client, but, I guess, litigation

10       privilege or immunity, whatever it's called,

11       brought to mind a case that I read not very long

12       ago involving -- and I don't recall all the

13       details of it, but it just came up in my head,

14       which you may be familiar with. It involved

15       Holland & Knight.

16            Are you familiar with that case?

17            MS. HUMPHRIES: Generally. I cannot quote to

18       you from it. I have not been immersed in it.

19            THE COURT: Is that a Second DC A or a Supreme

20       Court case? Is that one of the cases you were

21        referencing?

22            MR. WALKER: I don't think we did reference

23       that case, Judge.

24            THE COURT: Okay. Well, I recalled in

25       another case I'm presiding over that it had to do 3221

1        with --it might have been more in terms of -- now

2       that I recall, it probably is not applicable. It

3       had to do with statements, I think, that a lawyer

4       for Holland & Knight made during litigation in the

5       course of a trial that turned out to be false and

6       whether or not there was defamatory, which is a

7       far -- is far different than what we have here.

8       Anyway, it just -- it came up in my head. And I

9       said, Well -

10            MR. WALKER: You said that was one of your

11        cases?

12            THE COURT: No, no, no.

13            MR. WALKER: Okay.

14            THE COURT: I had a case where they argued

15       the decision in the Holland & Knight case.

16            MR. WALKER: I see.

17            THE COURT: Anyway, it's-

18            MS. HUMPHRIES: That sounds familiar, what

19       you're saying, Your Honor.

20            THE COURT: It came up in my head, and I --

21        it triggered some additional thought, but now that

22       I think about it, it was probably not on that

23       issue.

24            Anyway, let's get back to where we are.

25            MR. TRENTALANGE: Your Honor, I can represent 3222

1        to the Court that we will have admissible evidence

2       that Ms. Loyd smoked during two of her

3       pregnancies.

4            THE COURT: Okay. Well, then it's coming in.

5            (Exhibit PT1780 received.)

6            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, the next is 134.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Hold on.

8            MR. WALKER: Tab 134, which is Plaintiffs

9       Exhibit 2130. And the objection is relevance and

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=357
10       403. But in particular, I want to draw Your

11        Honor's attention to the numbered paragraph 2,

12       because I have argued at side bar a couple times

13       now that there is no claim in this case for false

14       or misleading statements to the public. And so we

15       don't believe it's appropriate to inject those

16       issues into this case. That paragraph does not

17       relate to concealment. That relates to

18       affirmative fraud, affirmative misrepresentations,

19       which has never been pled as an issue in this

20       case.

21             MR. UITERWYK: If they say cigarettes are

22       healthy and they know that they're not or either

23       misleading -- misleading can be the fact that

24       they're concealing it.

25            THE COURT: Okay. 3223

1            MR. WALKER: There were misrepresentation

2       claims that led to Engle findings that were not

3       upheld by the Engle -- the Florida Supreme

4       Court --

5            THE COURT: Right.

6            MR. WALKER: --in Engle.

7            THE COURT: You pointed that out. Your

8       objection is overruled.

9            (Exhibit PT2130 received.)

10            MR. WALKER: I would like to have a moment,

11        Judge, just to see if there is anything left.

12            THE COURT: Yeah.

13            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I just want to be

14       sure. We talked about one of the privileged

15       documents that had been sent to the Congressional

16       committee. And I believe Your Honor overruled our

17       objections and, essentially, held that you're not

18       going to sustain our privilege objections to those

19       documents.

20            THE COURT: Correct.

21             MR. WALKER: Okay. So I believe that

22       addresses tab 125, Plaintiffs 3651.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Say that again. Say that

24       again.

25            MR. WALKER: Tab 125, 3615, that's one of the 3224

1        documents that was stolen from attorney's offices

2       and was also sent to a Congressional committee

3       without a waiver of privilege. The next is --

4            THE COURT: I don't have any evidence that it

5       was stolen from any -- from anybody's office.

6       You're making that representation --1 don't have

7       any evidence of that.

8            MR. WALKER: Well, the document is

9       privileged, even --

10            THE COURT: Okay. But you added that--but

11        you added that statement. I'm not making a ruling

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=358
12       on that when I don't have any evidence to that

13       effect.

14            MR. WALKER: Well, then I would ask for an

15       opportunity to provide that evidence, Your Honor.

16       If it's pertinent -- if it's pertinent to your

17       ruling, we have --

18            THE COURT: Well, if it's pertinent to your

19       objection.

20            MR. WALKER: It is. It is, Judge.

21             THE COURT: Okay.

22            MR. WALKER: We would ask to provide, then,

23       the documents relating to No. 125, which is

24       Plaintiffs 3615.

25            THE COURT: Okay. So this document you 3225

1        contend -- you have a good faith belief that it

2       was stolen from whom?

3            MR. WALKER: It was stolen from offices of

4       lawyers representing Brown & Williamson Tobacco

5       Company. There was a paralegal that worked there

6       and stole the documents, stuffed them into his

7       pants and into his jacket and sold them to

8       plaintiffs lawyers, and after which they were --

9       they were put into the public domain.

10            MR. UITERWYK: I have got a letter here, Your

11        Honor.

12            MR. BIGGER: Hold on.

13            THE COURT: Okay.

14            MR. BIGGER: Can I just address that briefly,

15       Judge? They also were turned over to a

16       Congressman pursuant to a subpoena. They claimed

17       a privilege to that. So the fact they were,

18       perhaps, also stolen is irrelevant. If they were

19       turned over to Congress, there wasn't a valid

20       privilege assertion at that time.

21             THE COURT: Okay. Were they also turned over

22       to Congress?

23            MR. WALKER: We complied with a subpoena.

24            THE COURT: Right.

25            MR. WALKER: The subpoena did not make a 3226

1        determination as to our privilege.

2            THE COURT: Right. I understand that

3       argument, so I agree the alleged stealing of these

4       documents would not -- may not be relevant to my

5       ruling, so I'm not going to receive it.

6            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Judge. That was my

7       perception of Your Honor's ruling.

8            THE COURT: Right.

9            MR. WALKER: So that ruling then also applies

10       to tab 135, which is Plaintiffs Exhibit 718.

11             THE COURT: I don't have a 135.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Tab No. 135.

13            MR. WALKER: Tab No. 135.

14            THE COURT: I know.

15            MR. BIGGER: This is the garbled, jumbled

16       mess that we already talked about. I --

17            MR. WALKER: Right. We moved on from that

18       one. I'm sorry.

19            THE COURT: Okay.

20            MR. WALKER: Number 126, Plaintiffs 976 --

21        I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'm looking at the wrong

22       list. There are only two other documents that are

23       privileged documents that, essentially, have been

24       overruled by Your Honor's ruling about what was

25       provided to Congress. That's 124, Plaintiff s 3227

1        1524, and tab 145, Plaintiffs 2268.

2            MR. UITERWYK: You gave me too many different

3       numbers. I'm kind of confused. Can I repeat

4       those, Your Honor? Tab No. 124, PT1524; tab

5       No. 125, PT3615; tab No. 1 --

6            THE COURT: Let's take them one at a time.

7        125 I just ruled on. Let's take 124, please.

8            MR. UITERWYK: That would be the same ruling

9       as you said before. That's the same issues. Same

10       issue with regard to disclosures and failure --

11             THE COURT: Okay. I need to hear defense

12       objections. What are your objections? Same

13       objections in terms of privilege and turning it

14       over to Congress?

15            MR. WALKER: Which one are we talking about

16       now?

17            THE COURT: PT1524.

18            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor, the same

19       objections.

20            THE COURT: Okay. The objections are

21        overruled. I will admit that.

22            (Exhibit PT1524 received.)

23            MR. UITERWYK: And then -- and then 126, Your

24       Honor --

25            MR. WALKER:  145, tab 145. 3228

1            MR. UITERWYK: We're both going two different

2       ways.

3            MR. WALKER: Okay. You go first.

4            MR. UITERWYK: For the record, Your Honor --

5            THE COURT: Is 126 the garbled mess that you

6       gave to me before?

7            MR. UITERWYK: No, Your Honor.

8            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor.

9            THE COURT: Well, I don't have a 126. Oh,

10       wait a minute. There is a blank page.

11             MR. BIGGER: Keep flipping.

12            THE COURT: There is one behind it that says,

13       Outgoing cable, July 3rd, 1963.

14            MR. UITERWYK: That's it, Your Honor.

15            MR. WALKER: There is an objection to 126.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=360
16       It's not as to privilege. I can say it in a few

17       sentences.

18            THE COURT: Okay.

19            MR. WALKER: This is a document that relates

20       to research that was undertaken abroad as part of

21        a program that I will refer to as HIPPO. It's

22       referred that way in the documents. There is no

23       dispute in this case that the -- that the research

24       that was undertaken was faulty. And there were

25       problems with the research, that the conclusions 3229

1        were not valid. Typically, in spite of that, the

2       plaintiffs try to parade those documents in front

3       of the jury to suggest somehow that the tobacco

4       companies had knowledge from that flawed, invalid

5       research. And so that is a big part of our

6       objection to 126, in addition to hearsay relevance

7       and 403. The same argument applies to tab 125,

8       Plaintiffs 3615.

9            MR. BIGGER:  125 has already been received.

10            MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

11             MR. BIGGER: You can't go back in documents

12       in evidence and keep arguing.

13            MR. WALKER: That's not what we're doing,

14       Judge. You overruled my objection -- my privilege

15       objections. The privilege -- there was a

16       privilege objection to 125 that was overruled.

17       The other objection that I had to 125 and 126 --

18       they're right next to each other -- is that

19       they're irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial

20       because they relate to the results of research

21        that no one will contend was valid research.

22            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, if I could present

23       to the Court a letter --

24            THE COURT: Where does it say it's invalid

25       research? 3230

1            MR. WALKER: It doesn't say it in the

2       document. That's the problem. But there won't be

3       any dispute in this case that that research is

4       invalid. This is another instance like the stolen

5       documents. If there is any disagreement with my

6       representation, I can file what I need to file to

7       demonstrate that it's invalid. Plaintiffs own

8       witnesses, I think, would admit that and have

9       admitted that.

10            THE COURT: All right. Lay a foundation for

11        these, please.

12            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Two things. Are

13       you familiar with the HIPPO 1 and 2?

14            THE WITNESS: Yes.

15            MR. UITERWYK: Can you briefly tell the Court

16       what that's all about?

17            THE WITNESS: Sure. Battelle was a contract

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=361
18       organization that was hired by British American

19       Tobacco and did work on testing the hypothesis of

20       why people smoke and investigating the addictive

21        nature of nicotine in cigarettes. And their

22       conclusion that people smoke for nicotine,

23       certainly, has been validated through the research

24       that has gone on since.

25            MR. UITERWYK: And, in fact, there was a 3231

1        letter addressed from Mr. Yeaman to Mr. Jacobs, in

2       care of the Henry Ramm, Esquire, R.J. Reynolds

3       Tobacco Company in connection with this, dated

4       August 5th, 1963, which is identified at 1257?

5       Are you familiar with that?

6            THE WITNESS: lam. This is a letter that

7       was sent from Addison Yeaman. And attached to

8       that letter was tab 125, which was the implication

9       of Battelle HIPPO 1 and 2 and Griffith filter

10       dated July 17th, 1963. And Addison Yeaman sent

11        this particular letter along with that material to

12       Ed Jacobs, who represented -- who is outside

13       counsel for R.J. Reynolds and Henry Ramm. He was

14       the chief general counsel for R.J. Reynolds

15       Tobacco Company.

16            MR. UITERWYK: And then he's saying in this

17       letter, "I suggest to you and Henry that it is now

18       timely to release these reports to the SAB, that I

19       shall defer doing so until I have the benefit of a

20       further talk with you and Henry."

21             First of all, who is the SAB ?

22            THE WITNESS: That's the Scientific Advisory

23       Board of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

24            MR. UITERWYK: All right.

25            MR. WALKER: Judge, I misspoke earlier. This 3232

1        would be the second instance in which the

2       plaintiffs would ask you to disagree with

3       Judge Pendino. Judge Pendino excluded this

4       evidence and so did Judge Cook.

5            THE COURT: Okay. Well, I'm still -- I'm

6       unclear of the relevance of this document. What

7       is the relevance of this document?

8            MR. UITERWYK: We're -

9            MR. BIGGER: Which one are you asking about,

10       which tab?

11             THE COURT: I'm asking as to 976, Bates 0002.

12            MR. BIGGER: The outgoing cable?

13            THE COURT: Yes.

14            MR. UITERWYK: Judge, this was right around

15       the time that the Surgeon General report was being

16       written.

17            THE COURT: Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively).

18            MR. UITERWYK: And they were -- if you looked

19       at the letter from White & Case --1 think it's

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=362
20       important that the Court look at that letter,

21       because I think it tells you -- actually, if you

22       look at the cable, because the cable says -- and

23       in the cable itself that we're talking about,

24       before we even get to the issue of a letter --

25            THE COURT: Is this a follow-up to the 3233

1       White & Case letter?

2            MR. UITERWYK: You bet.

3            MR. BIGGER: Many of these are related to the

4       same sort of issue at the same time, Judge.

5            MR. UITERWYK: And what they say is-

6       basically, they conspired among themselves and

7       said, You know what, we agree that we don't think

8       that the Battelle and Griffith developments should

9       be sent to the Surgeon General, and we agree to

10       continue the Battelle work useful but disturbed at

11        the implications of recurrent cardiovascular

12       disorders.

13            So, basically, what they were doing, Judge,

14       is they were saying, Don't send these to the

15       Surgeon General report; don't use them in

16       connection with the first Surgeon General report

17       that is going to come out in 1964 on smoking and

18       health. Now, this is -- this is -- this is a key

19       document.

20            THE COURT: What is TIRC, T-I-R-C?

21             THE WITNESS: That was --

22            MR. UITERWYK: Go ahead.

23            THE WITNESS: TIRC was the group that was

24       formed in 1953 by the major cigarette

25       manufacturers to fund research into issues related 3234

1        to smoking and health. That was what their

2       charter said. And they were -- they had a

3       scientific advisory board that helped them select

4       the research, so that's what TIRC was. It's a

5       U.S. committee. I mean, it's an organization that

6       was founded by the U.S. cigarette manufacturers.

7            THE COURT: Okay. I still -- maybe I'm --

8       the hour is getting on here, and I'm --

9            MR. UITERWYK: Friday afternoon, five days,

10       Judge.

11             THE COURT: Well, I just don't understand the

12       outgoing cable.

13            THE WITNESS: Yeah, I can explain it.

14            THE COURT: Okay.

15            THE WITNESS: The Surgeon General's committee

16       was meeting at this time. They had written to

17       each of the cigarette manufacturers, including

18       Brown & Williamson, and asked them to turn over

19       all information and research that they had done on

20       issues related to smoking and health. In May of

21        that year -- that's the White & Case letter --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=363
22       they were getting advice as to what they were

23       going to turn over or not turn over to the Surgeon

24       General's committee.

25            In July, there is a cable talking about this 3235

1        research that Brown & Williamson and their parent

2       company, British American Tobacco, had done on

3       nicotine addiction, which was certainly a subject

4       of the Surgeon General's committee.

5            In July 17th, Addison Yeaman, chief general

6       counsel who writes, by the way -- and is the

7       author of the cable -- writes the implications of

8       the Battelle research and basically talks about

9       the fact that they determined that they're in the

10       nicotine addiction business and that there are

11        side effects associated with smoking. And they

12       are basically saying in this cable on July 3rd,

13       We're not going to turn over the results of the

14       HIPPO study to the committee; and we're not even

15       sure we're going to share it with the Scientific

16       Advisory Board, which was the appointed

17       independent scientists who were supposed to be

18       overseeing the research by the Tobacco Industry

19       Research Committee.

20            And then there is -- in August -- in fact,

21        it's August 5th of 1963, there is a letter from

22       Addison Yeaman attaching his memo on implications

23       of Battelle HIPPO 1 and 2 and the Griffith filter

24       sent to the chief general counsel, his

25       counterpart, at R.J. Reynolds. 3236

1            MR. WALKER: And that's exactly --

2            THE COURT: And so is it your position that

3       the reason why they didn't turn it over, this

4       study, was --no; I'm asking Mr. Walker -- was

5       because the study itself was flawed?

6            MR. WALKER: My position, Your Honor - and I

7       think it's the position of Judge Pendino twice and

8       Judge Cook once -- is that it's misleading to

9       suggest to the jury that we were -- that we were

10       concealing research that everyone recognized as

11        invalid research. That's not what --

12            THE COURT: Well, aren't you free to present,

13       if I admit this, to present testimony to that

14       effect? I mean, I wouldn't --

15            MR. WALKER: That's always true with evidence

16       that's unfair. If the -- if the misleading and

17       unfairly prejudicial nature of the evidence

18       outweighs any potential probative value it has, it

19       should be excluded.

20            THE COURT: Yeah, I agree with that

21       principle. But if you have a reason that is

22       different from -- if the -- if what you say is

23       accurate, couldn't you present a witness to

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=364
24       testify, Here is the reason why we didn't turn

25       that over, and we shouldn't be held responsible 3237

1        for not turning this over?

2            MR. WALKER: I think it's true that all

3       evidence that's inadmissible under 403 may be

4       evidence to which the other side can come forward

5       with some evidence. That doesn't -- and that

6       would simply lengthen this trial, but that doesn't

7       change the fact that it should be excluded, has

8       been excluded three times in this circuit. Out of

9       six trials, it's been excluded three times.

10            THE COURT: Okay. On 403 grounds?

11             MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

12            THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to admit it.

13            (Exhibit PT976 received.)

14            MR. UITERWYK: And this would be true, then,

15       Your Honor--

16            THE COURT: That was PT976.

17            MR. UITERWYK: And then PT3615, which is the

18       same subject, Your Honor.

19            THE COURT: Wait a minute. 976, which is tab

20        126.

21             And what else?

22            MR. UITERWYK: Tab 125, PT3615.

23            THE COURT: I have already done that one.

24            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. I thought we went back

25       to it. 3238

1            MR. BIGGER: No. It's in. That's in

2       evidence.

3            MR. WALKER: Judge, I am reliably informed

4       there are only four exhibits we haven't talked

5       about. If it would be okay, I would just like to

6       go through those four.

7            THE COURT: Yeah, sure.

8            MR. WALKER: Okay.

9            MR. UITERWYK: I count more. Oh, that we

10       haven't talked about.

11             MR. WALKER: Right.

12            MR. UITERWYK: We'll have to go through it.

13            MR. WALKER: The first is 120. I'm sorry.

14       Judge, we did do that one.

15            THE COURT: I sustained that one.

16            MR. WALKER: Sorry. The next one, then,

17       should be 123. Let me just double check.

18            MR. UITERWYK: Is 122 in?

19            THE COURT: Yes.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

21             THE COURT: Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

22       Yeah, as long as you redact it.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Right. I've got to redact.

24       Remember that, Baron?

25            MR. PHILIPSON: Yes.

3239

1            MR. WALKER: Just one second, Judge. Let me

2       just double check. So there are, in fact, only

3       two. Only two. My mistake. The first is 123,

4       Plaintiffs Exhibit 1817.

5            MR. UITERWYK:  123?

6            MR. WALKER: No.  128.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

8            MR. WALKER: The objection is relevance and

9       403 to 128.

10            THE COURT: What is -- what is 128?

11             MR. UITERWYK: It is a memo, PM memo, on the

12       Surgeon General report from Weissman to Cullman,

13       the head of the corporation.

14            THE COURT: And your objections are what,

15       Mr. Walker?

16            MR. WALKER: Relevance and 403, Your Honor.

17            THE COURT: All right. Be received in

18       evidence.

19            (Exhibit PT1817 received.)

20            MR. WALKER: The last one, Your Honor, is one

21        that I mentioned we would have to come back to on

22       youth marketing and Your Honor's Williams ruling.

23       That's No. 143. Again, my understanding,

24       originally, was that there was no limiting

25       principle by which -- and that no nexus would be 3240

1        required under Your Honor's Williams ruling.

2            You came back and said that to the extent

3       that the testimony or evidence was directed to

4       marketing to the public of which Ms. Loyd was a

5       part, that you felt that was an adequate nexus and

6       that no additional nexus would be required under

7       Williams.

8            Tab 143, which is Plaintiffs Exhibit 1433,

9       doesn't meet that criteria.

10            THE COURT: Okay. Let me look at it, please.

11             MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor -- go ahead,

13       please.

14            THE COURT: All right. I'm going to allow -

15       take out the handwritten notes on that, and I will

16       allow 143.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. And for the record,

18       that's PT1433.

19            (Exhibit PT1433 received.)

20            MR. WALKER: Has your Williams ruling

21        changed, or do you just believe that --

22            THE COURT: I think it's consistent with it.

23            MR. WALKER: All right. Thank you, Your

24       Honor.

25            MR. UITERWYK: Can I go for the -- quickly go 3241

1       over them to make sure we got them all, Judge?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=366
2            THE COURT: We will be in recess 10 minutes.

3       Confer with counsel on that.

4            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

5            (A recess was taken at 3:37 p.m.)

6            (Court called to order at 3:51 p.m.)

7            THE COURT: You may be seated.

8            Have we gone through all the objections --or

9       all exhibits?

10            MR. WALKER: All, Your Honor, except it turns

11        out they substituted a document into tab 130.

12            MR. UITERWYK: We did?

13            MR. WALKER: That's what I am told.

14            MR. UITERWYK: By whom?

15            MR. WALKER: Plaintiffs Exhibit 1493. It

16       wasn't on their -- it wasn't on any exhibit list

17       that they've previously given us for this witness,

18       but here it is.

19            THE COURT: Okay.

20            MR. WALKER: The objection is it wasn't -

21             THE COURT: I need to see the document at

22       issue here. Is it the October 18th, 1968,

23       document?

24            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor. I think they

25       pulled that document out and put a new document 3242

1        in. It should say PT01493.

2            THE COURT: Okay. Can I see document?

3            MR. UITERWYK: Sure.

4            MS. MCKINNISS: It was a different number.

5       Our lists were off.

6            MR. UITERWYK: It was just the list was off,

7       Judge. That list was off from ours.

8            Or the fact that we haven't talked about it?

9       Is that what you are saying?

10            MR. WALKER: I don't think it was on the -

11        it wasn't on what you gave us.

12            THE COURT: So you're offering PT1493 as

13       Exhibit 130?

14            MR. UITERWYK: No. Tab No. 130, Your Honor.

15            THE COURT: Tab NO. 130.

16            MR. UITERWYK: Correct.

17            MR. WALKER: Tab 130, Plaintiffs 1493.

18            MR. UITERWYK: Correct.

19            THE COURT: And your objections are?

20            MR. WALKER: We weren't given timely notice

21        that this exhibit would be used with this witness,

22       is the first one.

23            THE COURT: Okay.

24            MR. WALKER: And then apart from that, the

25       objection is relevance and 403 and hearsay. 3243

1            MR. BIGGER: Just a second, Judge. We have

2       this listed as admitted on our list, so I'm going

3       to check the transcript real quick.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=367
4            THE COURT: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

5            MR. BIGGER: We have this listed admitted

6       into evidence, so I'm going to look at the

7       transcript. So our list could be wrong. I'm just

8       checking real quick.

9            MS. McKINNISS: Our list may be wrong.

10            MR. WALKER: I'm happy to defer to the

11        clerk's notes, if 1493 was admitted.

12            THE COURT: How would it be admitted if it

13       was substituted for another exhibit?

14            MR. UITERWYK: It wasn't. It was placed -

15            MR. BIGGER: I see. Earlier on, Judge, it

16       came up, and I think there was a mixup. Why don't

17       you have your staff look at that, and let's move

18       on.

19            MR. WALKER: I thought that was the 2060 that

20       you gave me.

21             MR. UITERWYK: I think right now, Judge, we

22       would probably save time by just looking at the

23       exhibits.

24            MR. BIGGER: What the objections are, let's

25       just get to them. If it's twice admitted, it's 3244

1        admitted twice, so be it.

2            THE COURT: Mr. Walker, you are not saying

3       you haven't seen this exhibit before, only that

4       it's been -- hasn't been listed with this witness?

5            MR. WALKER: I'm now being told that it was

6       on their list.

7            THE COURT: Okay. It will be received.

8            (Exhibit PT1493 received.)

9            MR. UITERWYK: And you know what? With as

10       many documents as we're dealing with and numbers

11        and so forth, totally understandable, Mr. Walker.

12            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Mr. Uiterwyk.

13            MR. UITERWYK: You're quite welcome.

14            THE COURT: Are there any others ?

15            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor.

16            MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry. I get a little

17       giddy at the end of the day. How long do you plan

18       on going today, Judge?

19            THE COURT: Well, about three hours ago, I

20       was planning on going to 5:00. I mean, do you

21        really want to hold the jury here? We're not

22       going to finish Dr. Cummings anyway --

23            MR. UITERWYK: No, sir.

24            THE COURT: --1 mean, even on direct.

25            MR. UITERWYK: Not even close. 3245

1            THE COURT: Okay. So we'll end at 5

2       o'clock --

3            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

4            THE COURT: --at or about.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=368
6            THE COURT: Bring the jury in, please.

7            (The jury returned to the courtroom at

8       3:56 p.m.)

9            THE COURT: Thank you for your patience.

10       We're ready to proceed.

11             MR. UITERWYK: May it please the Court.

12            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   Dr. Cummings, I think we are going to be able

15   to get through these exhibits much quicker now.

16            I believe what we started to do before we

17   started discussing these exhibits, I was going to ask

18   you to start -- we're going to switch subjects and go

19   to the 50-year cover up. Correct?

20       A.   Correct.

21        Q.   Now, first of all, let me ask you a general

22   question. If there was a coverup, based on your review

23   when you discussed this with the jury previously, based

24   on your review of all the documents and your knowledge

25   of these documents and the documents that we're going 3246

1   to be seeing today and Monday, what was covered up?

2       A.   Basically what was covered up was what the

3   companies knew about the health risks of their products

4   and what they told the American public about those

5   risks, so internally looking at what they said versus

6   what they were telling the American public. So -- and

7   that was highly relevant.

8       Q.   And what did they do in that cover-up?

9       A.   What did they do? Well, they organized a

10   public relations campaign that was jointly created by

11    cigarette manufacturers and financed and carried out

12   over close to a 50-year period. That began in the

13   early 1950s and extended right through 1998. And they

14   hired a public relations firm to, essentially,

15   manufacture a controversy around the issue of smoking

16   and health. And they made affirmative promises to the

17   public that their products were not harmful to health;

18   that if there was anything bad about the product, that

19   they would correct it, among other things. There were

20   some other things that they talked about such as --

21        Q.   And we'll get into further detail. I just

22   want to give the jury an overview of what went on.

23            Why did they do it, based on your review?

24       A.   They did this to reassure consumers who might

25   otherwise discontinue using their product or not take 3247

1   up the use of their product to begin with.

2       Q.   And what effect did it have on consumers,

3   their consumers, like Jackie Loyd?

4       A.   It had the effect, based on my research of

5   their own internal assessments, of continuing their

6   ability to sell cigarettes and to be profitable in

7   doing so. So they did, in fact, reassure smokers that

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=369
8   it was okay to smoke. Beliefs about the health risks

9   of smoking did not change as rapidly because there was,

10   essentially, a manufactured controversy about smoking

11    and health that they basically perpetrated on the

12   American public. And they did it jointly as the

13   manufacturers. It was a financed program.

14            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

15       Narrative, nonresponsive.

16            THE COURT: Overruled.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   What did they do with the information that

19   they had internally both with regard to the health

20   effects, as well as the addictiveness of cigarette

21    smoking and their products?

22       A.   They concealed that information. They kept

23   it within the companies, although the different

24   companies shared the information internally among

25   themselves. But they did not acknowledge to the public 3248

1    or even to public health officials that their products

2   were injurious to health. And so they had the public

3   perspective versus what they said internally.

4       Q.   And did the actual cigarette companies get

5   together at some point in time in order to create this

6   cover-up?

7       A.   Yes. They -- very unusually, Paul Hahn, the

8   president of the American Tobacco, sent a telegram to

9   each of the heads of the cigarette companies, other

10   cigarette manufacturers, on December 10th, 1953, asked

11    them to come together, the heads of the tobacco

12   companies, to address the issue about smoking and

13   health that was beginning to emerge in the scientific

14   literature and decide how they would develop a unified

15   response.

16            On December 14th, the heads of the companies

17   met together. They agreed to hire Hill & Knowlton, a

18   public relations firm, which came and met with them on

19   December 15th. There were a series of meetings that

20   went on through the month of December. And they, at

21    the end of December, agreed jointly how they would

22   finance this public relations campaign that went on for

23   almost 50 years, paid for by the major cigarette

24   manufacturers.

25       Q.   And we will be looking at specific documents 3249

1   in that regard, will we not?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   And you have reviewed a number of documents

4   in order to obtain a representative sample on the issue

5   of the cover-up, correct?

6       A.   I have.

7       Q.   And audio-visual documents -- audio-visual as

8   well, as it relates to the cover-up?

9       A.   I have audio-visual or video clips that I

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=370
10   brought along at different time points representing the

11   public position by the cigarette industry. And they

12   spoke in a unified voice with their various public

13   relations spokespeople from the Tobacco Institute and

14   the various representatives from the company over --

15   over that almost 50-year period.

16       Q.   And will the documents that the jury will see

17   and that we will be -- that are in evidence now, the

18   documents that they will see, will they see what they

19   knew internally compared to what they said in the

20   public?

21             MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading,

22       argumentative.

23            THE COURT: Sustained.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   What did the documents show as to what they 3250

1   knew internally compared to what they said externally

2   or in public, and the video, in general, that we're

3   going to go over the specifics?

4       A.   Sure. My research shows that the companies

5   knew early on in the 1950s that their products were

6   likely the cause of cancer, and there was no dispute by

7   the end of the 1950s that their products did, in fact,

8   cause cancer. And what they told the American public

9   was that their products were not injurious to health,

10   that it was unproven whether smoking caused disease.

11    And, in fact, they talk about a public relations

12   campaign to reassure the public that it was okay to

13   smoke and to create doubt in the public's mind about

14   the health risks of smoking.

15       Q.   All right. You mentioned 1953. And let's go

16   to 1953, and even -- and then after that, through the

17    1990s, I think, will we not?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   And, in fact, the documents are -- that we're

20   going to be saying -- showing are pretty much -- they

21    are in chronological order, pretty much so?

22       A.   Pretty much, yeah.

23       Q.   And does it show the progression of the

24   cover-up, and does it show the progression of their

25   knowledge versus progression of what they said during 3251

1   that time frame?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   All right. Now, you mentioned they came

4   together in '53, and you mentioned that they -- there

5   was some -- some things prompted their coming together.

6   And you talked about this briefly earlier in your

7   testimony. But -- and we've heard about the mouse

8   studies and the Wynder mouse studies. Can you place

9   those in a chronological order vis-a-vis their coming

10   together and the conspiracy to cover up that we are

11    going to be talking about?

12       A.   Sure. In the early fifties, 1950 to be

13   exact, there were four major health studies that had

14   come out in major medical journals implicating

15   cigarettes as a cause of cancer in humans. These were

16   epidemiological studies. In addition, there were many

17   studies that were appearing in medical journals having

18   to do with the mouse paintings.

19            In 1953, Dr. Ernst Wynder and his colleagues

20   published a paper in the journal Cancer Research in

21    June of that year, where they took tobacco extract,

22   painted it onto the shaved backs of animals, and

23   observed tumors grow. This got published in the

24   scientific journal, Cancer Research, and also got

25   picked up in public media, including Life Magazine that 3252

1    did an expose on the research that Dr. Wynder had done

2   in the December issue of Life Magazine.

3       Q.   Let's look at 3013. And what are we seeing

4   here?

5            For the record, Your Honor, it's -- all the

6   exhibits are received in evidence that we're going to

7   be referring to.

8            THE COURT: All the ones that I admitted into

9       evidence. Obviously, don't put up anything that

10       hasn't been received.

11             MR. UITERWYK: There are only a couple, Your

12       Honor.

13            THE COURT: Okay. Well, it's your

14       responsibility to keep track of the ones that have

15       not been received.

16            MR. UITERWYK: We actually -

17            THE COURT: All right.

18            MR. UITERWYK: Go ahead. 3013, Barron.

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   What are we seeing here? Now, this is Life

21    Magazine.

22            And Life Magazine, for the younger people,

23   it was a huge publication in its time in the fifties?

24       A.   Sure. It was a large magazine that used

25   pictures as well as text. But they were well known for 3253

1   the pictures. The cover you can see on the left there,

2   I think it says Canasta pajamas. That was what they

3   were featuring there.

4       Q.   And did they, in fact -- did Life Magazine

5   talk or do an article about the mouse painting that you

6   talked about?

7       A.   Yes. You can see the inside cover. It was

8   actually the center part of the magazine. So if you

9   went to the very center where you can see the gentleman

10   with the smoking machine, that's Dr. Graham, who was

11    one of the authors of the paper. And it's just

12   demonstrating how they're smoking the cigarettes to

13   extract the tar. You can see the mice at the bottom

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=372
14   and the mouse painting that they are showing, and

15   then -- and then there's a little article written about

16   the results of this study showing that the more that

17   was painted on the skin of the mice, the more tumors

18   that they observed, as well as the larger the tumors

19   were. And then there was also a comment from American

20   Tobacco about this research that was in this article as

21    well.

22       Q.   Were there also advertisements in this

23   magazine as well?

24       A.   Yeah. Life Magazine carried colored,

25   full-page ads for cigarettes. This is the December 3254

1   issue, so you can see the three-colored ads. I think

2   Old Gold, Chesterfield, and Lucky Strike with all the

3   Christmas theme with the cartons because it is

4   December. This magazine came out in late November.

5       Q.   Of what year?

6       A.   1953.

7       Q.   All right. And were the cigarette companies,

8   including RJR and Lorillard, following this debate, as

9   they referred to it, I believe, or that it's not proven

10   yet or we don't know, or were they following this

11    debate -- the cigarette companies, were they following

12   this debate internally?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   And did they do their own review of

15   literature and scientific -- their own research on the

16   issue of cigarette smoking and health?

17       A.   Yes, they did.

18       Q.   And we've heard of this gentleman before.

19            This is 3608, if we could please, Barron?

20            It's the Survey of Cancer -- Survey of Cancer

21    Research, by Dr. Claude Teague. Why is this document

22   important as it relates to the cover-up that we're

23   going to be talking about?

24       A.   Well, the date is important. It shows, one,

25   in February of 1953, Dr. Teague, who was a chemist at 3255

1   R.J. Reynolds, essentially does a survey of the

2   published scientific literature about the relationship

3   between cigarette smoke and disease. And he looks at

4   all three categories of evidence.

5            He looks at the evidence on the chemistry,

6   what was known about the chemistry of tobacco smoke at

7   that time.

8            The animal studies, as I mentioned, there

9   were many animal studies dating back into the twenties

10   that had been done. He has about 40 of those that he

11    cites, and he summarizes that evidence. Those were on

12   the mouse painting experiments. Different kind of

13   tars, some from cigarettes, cigars, different animal

14   species that they looked at. But that's all

15   summarized.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=373
16            And then human clinical studies. That is,

17   the studies that were done --1 mentioned the four that

18   came out in 1950, but there were other studies that had

19   been published.

20            And he summarizes all that evidence, and then

21    he draws conclusions based on the findings of those

22   three lines of evidence.

23       Q.   And what was the conclusion regarding what

24   those studies revealed that he reported to the company

25   at that time, meaning RJR? 3256

1        A.   His conclusion is that the incidence of lung

2   cancer, which had been increasing in every decade, had

3   to be due to some environmental stimuli, and that he

4   points out that it closely parallels the increase in

5   cigarette smoking. And he -- as he points out, it's

6   highlighted here:

7            Studies of clinical data tend to confirm the

8   relationship between heavy and prolonged tobacco

9   smoking and incidence of cancer of the lung.

10            And it says, Extensive though inconclusive

11    testing of tobacco substances on animals indicates the

12   probable presence of carcinogenic agents in those

13   substances. And he points out that one worker has

14   identified known carcinogens in tobacco pyrosate, which

15   is the tar, essentially, that you extract from the

16   burned tobacco and paper.

17       Q.   And did he also conclude in here that it

18   raises a considerable question regarding the -- in

19   other words -- strike that.

20            Did he conclude in here -- what did he

21    conclude, Doctor? Because I can't read my own

22   handwriting.

23       A.   Well, he basically is concluding that the

24   human studies and the animals studies are --

25            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning 3257

1        and intent.

2            THE COURT: Sustained.

3   BY MR. UITERWYK:

4       Q.   All right. Does he refer to chemical

5   carcinogens in the smoke?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   And does he refer to what we talked to

8   before, polycyclic or polynuclear aromatic

9   hydrocarbons?

10       A.   Yes, he did.

11        Q.   And on page 17, what did he conclude, page

12    17?

13       A.   There is no conclusion on page 17.

14       Q.   Right here, at the bottom there. That was

15   the conclusion we went through. Sorry, Doctor.

16       A.   That's the conclusion we just went through.

17       Q.   We should have gotten together on this.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=374
18            And did he publish the conclusions that he

19   found in these publications?

20       A.   No, this document was not published. It

21   became available in the late nineties when the

22   documents became available publicly. There was never a

23   published research study. It was internal to R.J.

24   Reynolds.

25       Q.   And did RJR take the public position at all 3258

1   in 1953 that clinical studies tend to confirm the

2   relationship between heavy and prolonged smoking and

3   the incidence of cancer?

4       A.   Not publicly. Publicly, R.J. Reynolds took

5   the position that their products were -- had not been

6   proven, that there was no evidence that smoking caused

7   disease, even though internally they actually had a

8   review of the evidence that indicates just the

9   opposite.

10       Q.   Now, I want to shift gears a minute. If you

11    could, explain to the jury who -- a little bit and

12   orient them, who was the industry at that time that --

13       A.   Well, the main leaders of the industry were

14   American Tobacco and were the makers of Lucky Strike

15   and Pall Mall. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, their

16   lead brand was Camel. Later they came out with Winston

17   and Salem. You had Philip Morris, Benson & Hedges,

18   which was later bought by Philip Morris, but they were

19   separate companies at that time. Lorillard Tobacco

20   Company, they manufactured Kent cigarettes, which came

21    out in 1952, and also Old Gold cigarettes. Those were

22   their main brands, and a few others. And Brown &

23   Williamson Tobacco Company.

24       Q.   And was it these companies that came together

25   in 1953 to discuss what they were going to do about 3259

1   what had been disclosed?

2       A.   It was those companies that did come

3   together. There was one other company, Liggett &

4   Myers. They made Chesterfield and also L&M cigarettes.

5   And they were invited by Paul Hahn, American --

6   president of American Tobacco, in that telegram on

7   December 10th that I mentioned to come to the

8   Plaza Hotel in New York to meet. Liggett was the one

9   company that did not attend that meeting. The other

10   companies did come together on December 14th.

11        Q.   And prior to this meeting, was there any

12   organization called the Tobacco Industry Research

13   Committee?

14       A.   No.

15       Q.   Were there any organizations called The

16   Tobacco Institute that we've heard during the course of

17   trial yet?

18       A.   No.

19       Q.   All right. And they mentioned that they had

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=375
20   the meeting. They called this meeting at the

21    Plaza Hotel. Now -- and who came to that meeting?

22       A.   The presidents of the major cigarette

23   companies. So you had R.J. Reynolds, Philip Morris,

24   Lorillard, Brown & Williamson, Philip Morris, and

25   Benson & Hedges. 3260

1        Q.   Did they bring any epidemiologists like

2   yourself, public health doctors, scientists, medical

3   doctors or anything of that nature?

4       A.   No. People that attended the meeting were

5   the presidents of the company.

6       Q.   And did they invite anyone else to that

7   meeting as well?

8       A.   No, not on the 14th. They did on the 15th.

9   They invited Hill & Knowlton, the public relations

10   firm, that they hired.

11        Q.   And did Hill & Knowlton, following those

12   meetings -- and we're going to be talking about the

13   meeting in a minute -- but have you seen a document in

14   connection with what Hill & Knowlton -- and Hill &

15   Knowlton were the PR?

16       A.   Yes. A very large public relations firm.

17   They were located in New York City, headquartered in

18   the Empire State Building. And they attended the

19   meeting with the executives on the 15th. Not all the

20   executives stayed for the meeting, but they were all

21   kept informed. And then there were a series of

22   meetings. They went on throughout December and

23   actually -- for the next 40 years, actually.

24       Q.   Did they invite anyone to help them out with

25   the issue of the public health crisis or any public 3261

1   health issues as it related to smoking at those

2   meetings --

3       A.   No.

4       Q.   - other than a PR firm?

5       A.   No.

6       Q.   All right. Now, you mentioned that they met

7   at the Plaza Hotel. Before we do that, let's go to a

8   document that was prepared by Hill & Knowlton following

9   that meeting, tab -- sorry. PT2061, please.

10            And what is this document?

11        A.   This is a document written by an executive at

12   Hill & Knowlton, Mr. Ed Dakin, who is summarizing

13   interviews that were done with the research directors

14   of four of the cigarette companies that were actually

15   referenced that were going to be conducted in the

16   meeting minutes on December 15th. And he's preparing

17   information for the executives of the public relations

18   firm Hill & Knowlton as to what the charge would be to

19   the -- to the public relations firm and summarizing the

20   interviews that they had done with the research

21    directors of four of the companies.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=376
22       Q.   And can you tell the jury what is shown there

23   as to what these research directors of the cigarette

24   companies said to people at Hill & Knowlton?

25       A.   Sure. It said, The attitude of the men we 3262

1   must directly deal with in the industry is at once

2   interesting and important for us to understand. That

3   is why notes on the four interviews with research

4   directors are given at some length. You will get from

5   them little real information about lung cancer pro or

6   con, but you'll find some mighty interesting opinions.

7   One of the men said, It's fortunate for us that

8   cigarettes are a habit they can't break. Said another,

9   Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our company was the

10   first to produce a cancer-free cigarette. What we

11    could do to the competition.

12            Do you want me to read on?

13       Q.   No, that's fine.

14            Who was that research director at RJR? Is

15   this Mr. Hoover that we saw on an earlier document?

16            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   Who was that researcher?

19       A.   The head of research at R.J. Reynolds at the

20   time was Kenneth Hoover.

21        Q.   And was Mr. Hoover also on the board of

22   directors of RJR at this time?

23       A.   Yes.

24       Q.   And let's go to the Bates stamped -- is this

25   3 or -- no. 3263

1            And do they discuss what their role was going

2   to be -- what their purpose was going to be as it

3   relates to doing the PR that was going to be discussed

4   at the meeting at the Plaza Hotel?

5       A.   Yes. This is essentially at the end of this

6   forwarding memorandum indicating the charge back to the

7   executives of Hill & Knowlton regarding their new

8   client, the cigarette industry, and what they felt they

9   needed to do for them. They said, There's only one

10   problem, confidence and how to establish it, public

11    reassurance and how to create it in a perhaps long

12   interim when scientific doubts must remain, and most

13   important, how to free millions of Americans from the

14   guilty fear that is going to arise deep in their

15   biological depths regardless of any pooh-poohing logic

16   every time they light a cigarette. No resort to mere

17   logic ever cured panic yet, whether on Madison Avenue,

18   Main Street, or in a psychologist's office. And no

19   mere recitation of arguments pro, or ignoring of

20   arguments con, or careful balancing of the two

21    together, is going to deal with such fear now. That,

22   gentlemen, is the nature of the unexampled challenge to

23   this office.

24       Q.   And was this actually -- was this actually a

25   forecast of what they actually did do and were going to 3264

1    do or what were going to do and ultimately did do as to

2   how the tobacco companies and public relations was

3   going to approach smoking and the health issues?

4            MR. WALKER: Objection. Argumentative.

5            THE COURT: Sustained.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   How does this compare to what they did do?

8       A.   It's exactly what they did.

9       Q.   All right. Now, going back to this meeting,

10   counsel in opening said that the -- that the meeting

11    was not a public meeting -- that it was a public

12   meeting and --

13            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

14            THE COURT: Excuse me one moment, please.

15            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

16            THE COURT: I'm sorry. What's the --

17            MR. UITERWYK: I'll rephrase the question,

18       Your Honor.

19            THE COURT: Okay.

20   BY MR. UITERWYK:

21        Q.   Counsel in opening said there was nothing

22   secret with the meeting itself.

23            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. I object

24       to his representation about what I did or didn't

25       say. 3265

1            MR. UITERWYK: That's fair. Fair enough.

2            THE COURT: All right.

3            MR. UITERWYK: I'll withdraw it.

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   Defendants -- we've heard some evidence that

6   there was nothing secret about the meeting itself. The

7   fact that the meeting was held may not have been

8   secret, but was what happened at the meeting kept

9   secret?

10            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading and

11        argumentative.

12            THE COURT: Overruled.

13            THE WITNESS: Yes.

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   Tell the jury about that.

16       A.   Well, basically, the plan that was hatched

17   due to a public relations campaign was very different

18   than what was announced publicly as to what the joint

19   industry efforts was all about.

20       Q.   All right. Now, do we have minutes of those

21    meetings?

22       A.   Yes.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Minutes, PT2135.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   And what meeting was this the minutes of?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=378
3266

1        A.   This is the December 15th meeting, so it

2   preceded the forwarding memo. And it basically

3   indicates that they have hired Hill & Knowlton. These

4   minute -- meeting -- these minutes are written by an

5   executive for Hill & Knowlton, Burt Cass, and they are

6   basically talking about who attended the meeting on the

7    15th and that Liggett had been, you know, invited and

8   had chosen not to come to the meeting.

9       Q.   In fact, did that document reflect that those

10   executives from R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, U.S.

11    tobacco companies, etc., have agreed to go along with a

12   public relations program on the health issue?

13       A.   Correct.

14       Q.   Did any minutes reflect that we -- well,

15   we'll talk about that in a minute.

16            And did they have another -- go ahead here.

17            And what was discussed as reflected in those

18   minutes?

19       A.   Well, they were talking about, you know, how

20   they would respond --

21             MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. The

22       document speaks for itself.

23            THE COURT: Sustained.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   We'll read that. Tommy Ross, counsel for 3267

1   American Tobacco Company, has almost completed a white

2   paper on the scientific facts involved in the health

3   issue, which he will make available to us for use or

4   inclusion in something, and we will want to distribute

5   to all the press and magazines.

6            Do you know what that was referring to?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Tell the jury what it was referring to.

9       A.   Tommy Ross was a lawyer for American Tobacco

10   that had, basically, collected up research articles

11    that claimed that smoking did not cause disease, and he

12   had compiled these in a white paper. And that white

13   paper was later widely distributed to the public, to

14   editorial -- newspaper editorial leaders and members of

15   the press as the tobacco company's position that, in

16   fact, there was a controversy about whether smoking

17   caused disease. And so -- and this was the first of

18   the white papers that was issued in April of 1954. And

19   then there are internal records that talk about how

20   widely that was distributed and used and how effective

21    it was in changing the position that companies felt

22   they were in, in early 1953.

23       Q.   Is that what we saw earlier, which was

24   referring to creating the controversy?

25       A.   Yes. In fact, they used the title of it, was 3268

1   The Smoking Controversy. And they later issued white

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=379
2   papers from 1968 to 1984, every year.

3            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

4       Nonresponsive, narrative.

5            THE COURT: Overruled.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Go ahead.

8       A.   Every year they would issue these white

9   papers, you know, basically as a counter to the Surgeon

10   General's reports coming out. In fact, the white

11   papers were issued after they talked about

12   reestablishing the controversy in internal records

13   after the Surgeon General's report had come out in

14    1964.

15       Q.   And did they have another meeting then on

16   December the 28th, between the heads of all the

17   companies?

18       A.   Yes, they did.

19       Q.   And we're going to go over this document very

20   quickly, but are there minutes of that meeting as well?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   And tell the jury what the heads of Philip

23   Morris, Reynolds, Lorillard, American Tobacco Company,

24   Brown & Williamson and other companies like that at

25   that meeting. 3269

1        A.   Right. It indicates who attended the

2   meeting. This -- the minutes describe what they're

3   planning to do in terms of a public relations campaign

4   to kick it off, which was a newspaper article that

5   would appear in major newspapers with large population

6   basis around the country, a full page add, a paid ad.

7   So not just a press release but, in fact, a full page

8   ad so they would get their position out. They talked

9   about how they would jointly pay for this.

10            They also talked about the creation of the

11    Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which was a

12   jointly funded research effort that John Hill of Hill &

13   Knowlton had insisted that the tobacco companies create

14   in order to basically present a front that they were

15   actually concerned about, the emerging evidence coming

16   out around smoking and health. That's described in the

17   December 15th minute meeting -- minutes.

18       Q.   And you mentioned they discussed at that time

19   the running of a full page ad.

20       A.   That's right.

21        Q.   And did they discuss the ad at that meeting.

22       A.   They did.

23       Q.   And what, in fact, did they discuss in that

24   regard?

25       A.   Well, they had received a draft of what was 3270

1   referred to as the Frank Statement ad that had been

2   prepared by Hill & Knowlton, and they made edits to

3   that draft. And the edited version was eventually

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=380
4   published January 4th of 1954. So the -- they were

5   meeting throughout Christmas. I think the original

6   draft of the minutes were December 26th. They edited

7   those, as a result the meeting, of the executives

8   getting together to approve the add on the 28th. And

9   then the final ad appeared on January 4th, 1954.

10       Q.   And we will talk about -- and did all the

11    heads of the companies agree to that ad and to the

12   contents of that ad?

13       A.   Yes, they did.

14       Q.   Including the president of R.J. Reynolds and

15   the president of Lorillard, Mr. Kent, chairman of

16   P. Lorillard Company?

17       A.   Correct.

18       Q.   And let's look at the Frank Statement itself.

19            First of all, it's called the Frank

20   Statement. Why is it called the Frank Statement?

21             MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning

22       and intent.

23            THE COURT: Lay the predicate for that,

24       please.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 3271

1        Q.   All right. Was the statement named after

2   Frank?

3       A.   No.

4       Q.   All right. Has your research shown as to,

5   when they discussed this statement, what they would

6   call it and why they would call it that?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   And what was decided in that regard?

9       A.   Well, they would use a statement, a frank

10   statement, a direct statement, to cigarette smokers in

11    the United States. So a statement to their customers,

12   cigarette smokers.

13       Q.   And can we go over this Frank Statement for a

14   moment, please?

15            And this is PT307.

16            Do you have any idea how many papers this

17   Frank Statement ran in?

18       A.   Yes. Over 400.

19       Q.   And in January of 1954, Jacqueline Loyd is

20   addicted to cigarettes containing nicotine?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   And-

23       A.   Based on my assessment.

24       Q.   And Jacqueline Loyd is 19 years old?

25       A.   Correct. 3272

1        Q.   And caught in the addiction cycle at that

2   period?

3            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Leading

4       and argumentative.

5            THE COURT: Sustained.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=381
6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Was Jacqueline --1 asked that question.

8   Withdrawn.

9            Now, we've also got -- let's go back. We've

10   got Tobacco Institute --

11             MR. UITERWYK: Zoom out a little bit, please,

12       Barron.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   We've got the Tobacco Industry Research

15   Committee; is that correct?

16       A.   That's correct.

17       Q.   And that was the one that was set up in the

18   meetings?

19       A.   Correct.

20       Q.   And it was designed by them, as well as all

21    the sponsors, particularly Reynolds, Philip Morris,

22   Lorillard, Brown & Williamson, and American Tobacco

23   Company?

24       A.   Correct. And you can see the location is at

25   the Empire State Building. In fact, the Tobacco 3273

1   Industry Research Committee was one floor below.

2            MR. WALKER: Objection. Nonresponsive;

3       narrative.

4            THE COURT: Sustained.

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   All right. Let's go, Doctor, if we could

7   look at the actual statement on the left side of the

8   statement. And which particular statements do you

9   think are significant and why?

10       A.   Sure. They are referencing in the first

11   paragraph the mouse painting experiments that had come

12   out and were publicized in Life Magazine, as we have

13   seen in that December issue. And then they talk about

14   distinguished authorities indicating that there wasn't

15   complete agreement on what causes of lungs cancer were.

16   They point out, under No. 3, that there is no proof

17   that cigarette smoking is one of the causes.

18       Q.   Now, this is in--when did this ad come out?

19       A.   This is in January 4th, 1954.

20       Q.   And when was it that the Claude Teague paper

21    came out with regard to polycyclic aromatic

22   hydrocarbons, cancer-causing agents?

23       A.   That was in February of 1953, so almost a

24   year earlier.

25       Q.   All right. Go on, please. 3274

1        A.   So then they talk about three affirmative

2   promises that they make as the companies to the

3   American public. And the first is --

4            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning

5       and intent. Move to strike.

6            THE COURT: Okay. I don't know where you

7       are.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=382
8            THE WITNESS: Sure. "We accept."

9            THE COURT: All right. Sustained. Put

10       another question, please.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   All right. You talked about No. 3. And can

13   you read to the jury No. 4?

14       A.   Sure. It says, The statistics purporting to

15   link cigarette smoking with disease could apply with

16   equal force to any one of many other aspects of modern

17   life. Indeed, the validity of the statistics

18   themselves is questioned by numerous scientists.

19       Q.   Keep on going.

20       A.   We accept an interest in people's health as a

21   basic responsibility paramount to every other

22   consideration of our business. We believe the products

23   we make are not injurious to health. We always have

24   and always will cooperate closely with those whose task

25   it is to safeguard the public health. 3275

1        Q.   The last statement they made, We always have

2   and always will cooperate closely with those whose task

3   it is to safeguard public health, did they?

4       A.   No, not based on my research, they did not.

5       Q.   All right. Now, before this -- this was

6   published in 400 -- how many papers?

7       A.   Over 400.

8       Q.   Four hundred papers. Was it in every major

9   metropolitan area?

10       A.   Yes. They selected areas with populations of

11    25,000 or more.

12       Q.   And did they, in fact -- did they have a

13   draft of this statement?

14       A.   Yes.

15            MR. UITERWYK: And if we can look at 2295.

16   BY MR. UITERWYK:

17       Q.   Is that the draft?

18       A.   Yes. This draft was put together on December

19   26th, the day after Christmas in 1953, and then

20   corrected by the committee, in other words, by the

21    executives who met on December 28th, 1953, at the Plaza

22   Hotel.

23       Q.   And what changes were made in the draft --

24   well, what changes did they make on the draft that were

25   reflected in the final document that we've reviewed? 3276

1        A.   Well, they did have markings that indicate

2   that they changed certain words. In fact, those edits

3   that are reflected in this draft do not appear in the

4   final version. So, in fact, they accepted the edits as

5   they are shown here. So they say, you know, we believe

6   the products we make are not injurious to health.

7   Science has no proof to the contrary. The section

8   "science has no proof to the contrary" was stricken in

9   they draft and did not appear in the final version.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=383
10       Q.   All right. What other changes did they make?

11        A.   We will never produce and market a product

12   shown to cause -- to be the cause of any serious human

13   ailment. We always have and always will cooperate

14   closely with the government -- governmental authorities

15   whose task it is to safeguard the public health.

16            And what appeared in the final version is, We

17   believe the products we make are not injurious to

18   health. We always have and always will cooperate

19   closely with those whose task it is to safeguard the

20   public health.

21        Q.   Now, the first part of that paragraph, where

22   they say, We will never produce and market a product

23   shown to be the cause of any serious human ailment, did

24   they ever do that?

25       A.   No. Their products do cause great harm to 3277

1   human health.

2       Q.   All right. Now, were there any other changes

3   in that document?

4       A.   Yes. One other one, on the last page. Under

5   the No. 4, it says, The committee will undertake to

6   keep the public informed of such facts as may be

7   developed relating to cigarette smoking and health and

8   other pertinent matters.

9            They're talking in relationship to the

10   research program that they were pledging to, you know,

11    to support.

12       Q.   And -- sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt

13   you.

14       A.   Yeah. So they took that part out.

15       Q.   Let's go back to the final -- the draft --

16   the final Frank Statement that appeared in the paper.

17            Now, did -- how many times did that draft

18   appear in the papers?

19            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Asked

20       and answered.

21    BY MR. UITERWYK:

22       Q.   Not the draft, the Frank Statement itself,

23   how many times?

24            THE COURT: Sustained. Asked and answered.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 3278

1        Q.   Was it publicized -- other than the placing

2   of the ads, was it publicized, widely publicized?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   Tell the jury about how widely publicized

5   that Frank Statement was.

6       A.   Well, they had spokespeople who went out on

7   the road to give, you know, talks, essentially, in

8   talking about the pledges that were made in the Frank

9   Statement. And they also had their spokespeople who

10   would appear on television and radio stations,

11    essentially, you know, reiterating the statements in

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=384
12   the Frank Statement.

13       Q.   And were there articles in newspapers

14   throughout the country regarding this Frank Statement?

15       A.   Yes, there were.

16       Q.   And regarding the positions that the

17   companies were taking with regard to the smoking and

18   health issue?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   And was it not just over one day, but was it

21    over a period of time?

22       A.   Yes. I mean, the Hill & Knowlton company,

23   they created a public relations committee of the

24   Tobacco Industry Research Committee, largely run by

25   Hill & Knowlton, that had a large amount of publicity 3279

1   putting out white papers, press releases, helping write

2   articles that appeared in major, you know, magazines

3   around the country. And they reprinted some of those

4   articles and distributed articles, like, "Smoke Without

5   Fear" was one of the article titles that they helped

6   create.

7       Q.   Let me stop you for a minute -- for a moment,

8   Dr. Cummings. And so we can move on from this Frank

9   Statement before we get into what they did continuing

10   on, what do they say on the right side as it relates to

11    what they would do?

12       A.   Well, they were announcing the creation of

13   the Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

14       Q.   Hold on. What did they announce there?

15       A.   They say, At one time or another during those

16   years, critics have held it responsible for practically

17   every disease of the human body. One by one these

18   charges have been abandoned for lack of evidence.

19            And then they went on to pledge --

20       Q.   Go ahead to the pledge.

21        A.   We are pledging aid and assistance to the

22   research efforts into all phases of tobacco use and

23   health. This joint financial aid will, of course, be

24   in addition to what is already being contributed by

25   individual companies. 3280

1        Q.   Let's skip 2, because we already know about

2   that.

3            And then what do they say that they will do

4   with the -- do with the scientific advisory board?

5       A.   Well, they said they would appoint, you know,

6   committees of high standing and unimpeachable integrity

7   to serves as an advisory board to oversee the research

8   that they were going to pledge to support. And so

9   that's what they said they were going to do.

10       Q.   And did they, in fact, appoint a scientific

11    director for the Tobacco Industry Research Committee?

12       A.   They did.

13       Q.   Who did they appoint?

14       A.   Clarence Cook Little, eventually.

15       Q.   All right. And, also, was Mr. Hartnett

16   involved in this committee?

17       A.   Well, they had a chairman of the Tobacco

18   Industry Research Committee. The original chairman was

19   Paul Hahn, the president of American Tobacco. And then

20   later Parker McComas took over that role for about

21    three months in 1954. And then Mr. Hartnett, who had

22   been the president of Brown & Williamson Tobacco

23   Company, resigned his position as president of Brown &

24   Williamson and took over as the chairman for the

25   Tobacco Industry Research Committee. So he was sort of 3281

1   the executive in charge of the whole operation.

2       Q.   And you mentioned that there was some

3   interviews as regards this statement.

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   And was Mr. Hartnett interviewed on TV as

6   well --

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   -- in regard to it?

9       A.   He was interviewed in 1955. There was a

10   series of interviews done with people involved in the

11    smoking and health issue, both pro and con, who were

12   interviewed on the "See It Now" show, the Edward R.

13   Murrow Show, a very popular news show of the day,

14   and --

15       Q.   Kind of like a Tom Brokaw?

16       A.   More like 60 Minutes, I would say.

17       Q.   Okay.

18       A.   And there were two segments that they devoted

19   to the smoking and health issue in the spring of 1955.

20   And Mr. Hartnett appeared, as well as other

21    representatives of the Tobacco Industry Research

22   Committee, on that show.

23       Q.   All right. Let's play that, please.

24            (A video clip as played for the jury.)

25            A SPEAKER: This is Timothy V. Hartnett, 3282

1        former president of a major tobacco firm and

2       chairman of the Industry Research Committee.

3            Mr. Murrow, I would like to quote from a

4       statement released at the time the Tobacco

5       Industry Research Committee was formed. At that

6       time we stated, We accept an interest in people's

7       health as a basic responsibility paramount to

8       every other consideration in our business. And

9       that's where we stand today.

10            (End of video clip.)

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   Was he reading from the Frank Statement?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   All right. Now, let me --1 want to go a

15   little bit -- we talked about the Tobacco Industry

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=386
16   Research Committee. I want to go over quickly, not in

17   great detail, the setup of that committee.

18            Is that important for the jury to understand,

19   the setup of the committee as it relates to what that

20   committee did, how it was controlled, who controlled --

21    actually controlled the committee?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   All right. And what will you be conveying in

24   summary form as it relates to the Tobacco Industry

25   Research Committee? 3283

1        A.   Essentially, the committee was run by the

2   presidents of the tobacco companies that contributed

3   the resources to it, and so there was an executive

4   committee. And they approved all budgets and had the

5   final say over everything. Under them was a legal

6   committee referred to as the lawyer committee,

7   committee on counsel. There are a variety of names

8   that were used. They oversaw the day-to-day

9   operations, basically, of the -- of the organization in

10   terms of them meeting more regularly, and there are

11    minutes of their meetings.

12       Q.   Who was on the executive committee?

13       A.   The executive committee was the presidents of

14   the tobacco companies. The lawyer committee was, for

15   the most part, the general counsel -- chief general

16   counsel or their designee. Also, the executive

17   committee could be the president or their designee.

18       Q.   And the committee--was it called the

19   committee of counsel?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   And can you describe for the jury that --

22   what their role was within the organization, the

23   committee of counsel, generally, believe?

24       A.   Yes.

25            MR. PEDROSA: Objection. Repetitive. 3284

1            THE COURT: Overruled.

2            THE WITNESS: Yes. They said, essentially,

3       the policies, what statements would be issued were

4       all approved by the committee on counsel before

5       they would be released to the public, because they

6       would speak -- the industry spoke with one voice

7       on issues related to smoking and health during

8       this time period.

9            And they also later were involved in

10       selecting some of the research that ultimately got

11        funded.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   Did they, counsel -- the committee of counsel

14   actually do some control or have some control over what

15   emanated from the scientific advisory board over the

16   years?

17       A.   Yes. There was a scientific advisory board

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=387
18   of very well-known scientists who did oversee some of

19   the research. But there were two types of research.

20   There was the public research that was selected and

21    reviewed by scientists under a peer review process.

22   And then the research referred to as special projects,

23   which was research that was undertaken by scientists

24   who were recruited by the lawyers for the various

25   companies. And that research, the special project 3285

1   research was considered the research that was most

2   valuable to the tobacco companies according to their

3   own internal business records.

4            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. 403, as

5       to the portion of the answer that relates to the

6       motion that was made earlier in the case.

7            THE COURT: Overruled.

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   And will we see evidence of that in some of

10   the documents we'll be looking at probably tomorrow

11    now?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   Now --

14            THE COURT: Monday.

15            MR. UITERWYK: Oh, sorry. Yes, thanks,

16       Judge. It would be difficult to get to the

17       courthouse tomorrow, I think.

18            THE COURT: It would be for you.

19            MR. UITERWYK: Yes, Judge.

20   BY MR. UITERWYK:

21        Q.   Now, we're going to jump ahead of time for a

22   minute, just so we can get a little bit of the lay of

23   the land and the setup. Was there also set up in the

24   thing that we referred to earlier as The Tobacco

25   Institute? 3286

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   And when was that set up?

3       A.   The Tobacco Institute came about in 1958. It

4   was originally the Tobacco Industry Research

5   Committee's communications committee. And they spun

6   that off, and it became The Tobacco Institute, which

7   was a trade association that, from 1958 through the end

8   of the 1990s, was the primary spokespersons for the

9   members of The Tobacco Institute.

10       Q.   And was it a PR?

11        A.   It primarily did public relations. They also

12   did, you know, various government relations work.

13       Q.   And did they have a similar committee in the

14   Tobacco Institute that they had in TIRC, meaning a law

15   committee?

16       A.   Yeah, it was the -- they had an executive

17   committee. The presidents, the same presidents ran the

18   TIRC that ran the Tobacco Institute, and they also had

19   a law committee made up usually of the same people who

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=388
20   oversaw the Tobacco Institute activities.

21        Q.   And do we have records and will we see

22   evidence that, in fact, the lawyers played a role in

23   the PR that was coming, emanating from the Tobacco

24   Institute?

25       A.   Yes. 3287

1        Q.   Now, my question also is, over time, were

2   there representatives of Lorillard and RJR on these

3   committees?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   One of them was Ed Horrigan?

6       A.   Yes. He was chief executive officer for R.J.

7   Reynolds.

8       Q.   And Mr. Ramm?

9       A.   Mr. Ramm was the was chief general counsel

10   for R.J. Reynolds.

11        Q.   Now, earlier we were looking at this

12   forwarding memorandum. And we talked about, I believe

13   it was -- we were talking about the biggest hurdle is

14   public confidence or something to that effect. Is that

15   right?

16       A.   Public reassurance.

17       Q.   Public reassurance. And they made

18   recommendations. What did they want to give them

19   public reassurance about, what?

20       A.   To continue to smoke.

21        Q.   And after they issued the Frank Statement in

22    1954 and made that promise in the statement and made

23   the statements to the American people and set up TIRC,

24   as we discussed, later set up TI, what type of PR

25   machine did they set up through TIRC and Hill & 3288

1   Knowlton?

2            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

3       Argumentative.

4            THE COURT: Sustained.

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   What did they set up with regard to PR? You

7   have talked about the white papers.

8       A.   Yeah. The white papers. They issued press

9   releases. They had spokespeople for the companies, or

10   they sometimes used scientists who disputed the link

11   between smoking and disease to make sure, if there was

12   ever an article published about smoking being harmful,

13   there would be a counter response from the companies.

14   They had spokespeople appear on, you know, television,

15   radio.

16       Q.   Let's talk -- let's look at that for a

17   moment. Are we going to see some -- some of those

18   videos as to these spokespeople, spokespersons either

19   from TIRC or TI?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   And the first is 16 -- 1682 B. And this is

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=389
22   "See It Now."

23       A.   This is also the "See It Now" show. This

24   is-

25       Q.   Who is this we are going to be seeing? 3289

1        A.   Robert DuPuis, who was director of research

2   for Philip Morris. He also served, as did many of the

3   research directors, on the technical research committee

4   of the -- of TIRC, of the Tobacco Industry Research

5   Committee. And that's how he's represented in the clip

6   from the "See It Now" show, 1955.

7            MR. PHILIPSON: Do you want to show the clip?

8            MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry. I was waiting for

9       you to play it.

10            (A video clip was played for the jury as

11        follows:)

12            A SPEAKER: As Dr. Little said earlier, all

13       of the research of the tobacco Industry Research

14       Committee is done independent of the cigarette

15       companies. Nonetheless, each major cigarette

16       producer has been conducting its own experiments

17       on this problem.

18            This is the Richmond laboratory of one of the

19       major producers.

20            MR. DUPUIS: I am Dr. Robert M. DuPuis,

21        chairman of the industry technical group of the

22       Tobacco Industry Research Committee.

23            Our primary objective is to analyze all of

24       the components of smoke. Of course, we do a great

25       deal of research on analysis and technology of 3290

1        tobacco itself. But even if we knew all of the

2       components of tobacco, we still would not know the

3       components of smoke. And since smoke is what we

4       sell, we feel that we should emphasize this phase

5       of research.

6            After we have produced the smoke and

7       separated it into fractions, the next step is to

8       identify these fractions. These are then

9       identified, either photographically or on the

10       oscilloscope. The oscilloscope is now

11        demonstrating the means of identification of one

12       of the smoke components.

13            Using these instruments, we have isolated and

14       identified some three dozen components of smoke.

15       Many more will be identified. As we find these

16       components, we publish the results of our work in

17       technical journals which are available to any

18       scientist in any part of the world. So far we've

19       found none that give us any cause for concern. If

20       we do find any that we consider harmful -- and so

21        far we have not --we will remove these from smoke

22       and still retain the pleasure of your favorite

23       cigarette.

24            (The video clip was concluded.)

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 3291

1        Q.   And who was he with?

2       A.   He was the research director of Philip Morris

3   and also was the chairman of the Technical Research

4   Committee which was made up of the research directors

5   of the companies for TIRC.

6       Q.   He made some comments as to what they were

7   going to do and what they did. Did they do it?

8       A.   Remove the harmful constituents? No, they

9   did not.

10       Q.   Are we going to see evidence that they knew

11    about it and didn't?

12       A.   We are going to see evidence that they knew

13   that there were harmful components, and we're going to

14   see evidence that they knew they could not remove them

15   all.

16       Q.   When smokers like Jackie Loyd -- this was

17    1955?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   When smokers who were addicted to cigarettes

20   like Jackie Loyd see a piece like this, "See It Now,"

21    as an addicted smoker and as an expert on addicted

22   smokers and the message that they receive, how do they

23   react? What does that give them from an addiction

24   point of view?

25            MR. WALKER: Objection. Assumes facts not in 3292

1        evidence with respect to Mrs. Loyd.

2            THE COURT: All right. Sustained. Rephrase.

3       Please.

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   When smokers hear statements like this,

6   addicted smokers, what does it do as far as their

7   addiction is concerned to promote it and foster it and

8   continue with it?

9       A.   It gives people reassurance that it's okay to

10   continue to smoke; that the product, in fact, was

11    represented as, you know, nothing harmful has been

12   found, but if one harmful ingredient is found, we would

13   take it out. So it's reassuring and it gives somebody

14   who is an addicted smoker and might be hearing evidence

15   coming out about the health risks of smoking

16   reassurance that it's okay to continue the product,

17   continue smoking the product.

18       Q.   All right. And I want you to refer to a

19   memo. Are you familiar with a memo dated 1955 by Hill

20   &Knowlton?

21             Exhibit No. 3694, if we could, please,

22   Barron.

23            Now, what's this memo about? It's marked

24   confidential.

25       A.   Yes.

3293

1        Q.   And to whom was this memo provided for?

2       A.   Well, this is, you know, the public relations

3   report from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee

4   produced by Hill & Knowlton. It's on Hill & Knowlton

5   stationery, to Mr. Hartnett, who is the chairman of the

6   TIRC. And they are talking about essentially the

7   effect of their announcing TIRC and the announcing

8   their research program that they were undertaking to

9   fund and how -- whether it's been successful or not.

10       Q.   And what do they reflect in that regard?

11        A.   Well, they say factors show improved

12   position. The first big scare continues on the wane.

13   And they said the research program of the Tobacco

14   Industry Research Committee has won wide acceptance in

15   the scientific world as a sincere and valuable and

16   scientific effort.

17       Q.   All right. And are they also -- during this

18   time it mentions --

19            Are they doing research themselves

20   internally?

21             MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I'm sorry, under the

22       rule of completeness, may I ask that the remainder

23       of the second paragraph be read?

24            THE COURT: Yes.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 3294

1        Q.   Sure.

2       A.   Under No. 2?

3       Q.   Sure.

4       A.   This is due primarily to the stature of the

5   men serving on the scientific advisory board, the

6   soundness of the research program developed, the

7   caliber of the research so far approved, and of the

8   investigators receiving grants.

9            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Your Honor.

10   BY MR. UITERWYK:

11        Q.   Now, did they continue with their own

12   scientific research?

13       A.   They being?

14       Q.   The cigarette companies.

15       A.   The cigarette companies, yes.

16       Q.   And if we could look at 3612. First of all,

17   what is the date of 3612?

18       A.   September 28, 1956.

19       Q.   And I can't recall. Have we seen Rodgman

20   before in this trial?

21        A.   I'm not sure if we have. I think I've

22   mentioned him. Alan Rodgman was an analytic chemist

23   hired at R.J. Reynolds to lead their chemistry division

24   in 1954.

25       Q.   And what is this particular document about? 3295

1       A.   This is one of a series of reports that came

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=392
2   from Dr. Rodgman summarizing their research on the

3   smoke components, the smoke chemistry of different

4   brands of cigarettes that RJ. Reynolds manufactured.

5   So he is summarizing both some of the scientific

6   literature as well as talking about some of the

7   internal literature or studies that Reynolds had

8   undertaken and had not published at that time.

9       Q.   And I don't want to get too technical here,

10   but what I want you to do, Doctor, is if you can point

11    out the portion of the summary where he refers to the

12   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or what are called

13   PAHs. And are these the cancer causing agents?

14       A.   Yes. The context is important.  1956, they

15   are really inventing at this point the methodology for

16   isolating these chemicals. And what he's summarizing

17   here is that five polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons --

18   and he names them -- have been isolated and identified

19   in the cigarette smoke condensate from Camel brands or

20   blends of tobacco.

21             These hydrocarbons were identified by

22   standard chemical technique and conversion to one or

23   more known derivatives.

24       Q.   All right. And so in 1956, did they, at that

25   time, RJR's own scientists identify polycyclic 3296

1   hydrocarbons in the smoke of RJR cigarettes?

2            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. The

3       document speaks for itself. Argumentative.

4            THE COURT: Sustained.

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   Did they -- would these be the same type of

7   compounds that were talked about by Claude Teague back

8   in 1953?

9       A.   Yes, some of them. Benzo[a]pyrene

10   specifically was talked about by Dr. Teague.

11        Q.   And how many did they find?

12       A.   He had isolated five, you know, PAHs in smoke

13   of Camel cigarette blended tobacco.

14       Q.   And what is the significance of this document

15   and what it related -- and as it relates to what we are

16   talking about in this case right now?

17       A.   Well, they are isolating why in those animal

18   studies, when you paint tar extract onto the animals,

19   they develop tumors. They are now identifying the

20   specific chemical compounds in the tar that are cancer

21    causing. And this is in 1956.

22       Q.   When they discovered this, did they do any

23   press releases?

24       A.   No.

25       Q.   Did they make any disclosure to the public, 3297

1   what they found in their own cigarette smoke, in the

2   smoke of their own cigarettes?

3       A.   Well, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=393
4   did do a press release in 1957 saying that they had not

5   identified any harmful constituents in cigarette smoke.

6       Q.   Did RJR ever disclose what they found in

7    1956, their own scientists, in their products?

8       A.   No, sir.

9       Q.   All right.

10            THE COURT: Approach, please.

11             (At the bench)

12            THE COURT: We are going to break soon.

13            MR. UITERWYK: As good a time as any.

14            THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

15            (In open court)

16            THE COURT: Members of the jury, we are going

17       to grant a recess at this point in time, and tell

18       you that we appreciate your patience and your

19       interest in the ongoing litigation, and to remind

20       you to -- of my instructions to keep an open mind.

21        You have all taken an oath to refrain from doing

22       any research whatsoever on the Internet or in any

23       other means or communicating about this case to

24       anyone by using any means whatsoever. And I'm

25       just reminding you of your oath regarding that 3298

1        fact.

2            So we'll be in recess until 9:00 a.m. Monday

3       morning. Have a nice weekend. Thank you. Please

4       leave your pads on the chair.

5            (The jury retired from the courtroom at 5:01

6       p.m.)

7            THE COURT: All right. You may be seated.

8            Let me -- let's go over --1 think by --

9            Dr. Cummings, you are excused until nine

10       o'clock Monday morning. Thank you.

11             THE WITNESS: Thank you.

12            (The witness retired from the stand.)

13            MR. UITERWYK: And, Judge, Your Honor, I take

14       it counsel doesn't have any problem if I talk to

15       him about arrangements and scheduling and things

16       of that nature?

17            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor.

18            THE COURT: That's fine. Monday, you can

19       give defense counsel an approximation of when you

20       think you might rest?

21             MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

22            THE COURT: At least how many more witnesses

23       you have?

24            MR. UITERWYK: Yes.

25            THE COURT: And do you know approximately --3299

1        do you know the names of the witnesses you intend

2       to call at this point?

3            MR. UITERWYK: Some of them.

4            THE COURT: Okay. All right.

5            MR. TRENTALANGE: Your Honor we --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=394
6            THE COURT: You talk about it over the

7       weekend.

8            MR. TRENTALANGE: Right. We know who they

9       are. And, you know, the only potential will be

10       that we cut one or two of them out.

11             MR. UITERWYK: That's why I said some of

12       them.

13            MR. WALKER: I think they don't want to tell

14       us, Your Honor.

15            THE COURT: Pardon me?

16            MR. WALKER: I think they just don't want to

17       tell us.

18            MR. UITERWYK: No. You know what? We will

19       be glad to tell you.

20            MR. TRENTALANGE: Here is the deal. I don't

21       know how long Mr. Walker is going to be in

22       cross-examination. We have Dr. Tan, who is

23       definitely coming. We have Dr. Vasquez, who is

24       definitely coming. As to when they can come, they

25       are both practicing physicians, and it depends on 3300

1        the time of day that Mr. Walker finishes as to

2       which one of those. We have my client, Ms. Evers,

3       who is going to be a witness. And I'm not being

4       cute with her, but we can plug her in because

5       she's here all the time.

6            THE COURT: Right.

7            MR. TRENTALANGE: So depending on what time,

8       knowing that Your Honor's rule is if you don't

9       have a witness, you have rested, she's our

10       fail-safe.

11             THE COURT: Right.

12            MR. TRENTALANGE: So and we also have some

13       videos that we told counsel that we could play to

14       fill any dead time, and they don't need notice for

15       those.

16            THE COURT: Okay.

17            MR. TRENTALANGE: So, you know, it's just a

18       timing situation and the availability of treaters.

19            THE COURT: All right.

20            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Mr. Trentalange.

21        That's helpful.

22            THE COURT: Let me return to you,

23       Mr. Uiterwyk, the deposition designations for

24       Kristy Leung, because you've advised me you are

25       not going to be calling her. 3301

1            MR. UITERWYK: I don't think that's mine.

2            MR. PEDROSA: I'll take that Your Honor.

3            MR. UITERWYK: I will be glad to take the

4       notebook and save me 30, 40 cents, but --

5            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor-

6            MR. UITERWYK: This is, Judge, as I

7       indicated, I don't intend to use it, but things

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=395
8       change with regard to other designations.

9            THE COURT: Well, you are going to have a

10       hard time getting me to rule on it. I can tell

11        you that.

12            MR. UITERWYK: I understand that.

13            MR. PEDROSA: I will save it in the

14       courtroom, and if Mr. Uiterwyk wants to bring it

15       back up --

16            THE COURT: And you intend to call

17       Mr. Robinson?

18            MR. UITERWYK: I do, Your Honor.

19            THE COURT: Okay. Then I will review that.

20            MR. PEDROSA: And, Judge with respect to Mr.

21        Robinson --

22            MR. UITERWYK: All things being equal.

23            MR. PEDROSA: It's actually Dr. Robinson. He

24       is a chemist.

25            THE COURT: Oh, okay. 3302

1            MR. PEDROSA: With respect to Dr. Robinson,

2       we did not at the time we created this binder,

3       include objections as to cumulative, because

4       obviously we didn't know what other evidence would

5       be on. We've now heard a great deal of evidence,

6       much of which I would contend there are

7       designations in Dr. Robinson that would be

8       cumulative to things the plaintiffs have already

9       put on. Rather than swap out the binder again,

10       what I had someone do just today, based on what

11        Dr. Cummings has testified to so far, is just

12       prepare a list of places where we think that the

13       designated testimony from Dr. Robinson is

14       cumulative to what Dr. Cummings or another witness

15       has already testified to.

16            I don't think I need to be heard on it or

17       argue it. But I would like to hand that up and

18       put it to sleep.

19            MR. UITERWYK: Before you do that, hold on a

20       minute. This is the first I've heard about it.

21             MR. PEDROSA: It's 

22            MR. UITERWYK: Let me finish, please.

23            MR. PEDROSA: -- been e-mailed to you.

24            MR. BIGGER: Okay. Well, obviously I've been

25       somewhere I could not get e-mails. 3303

1            MR. PEDROSA: I understand.

2            MR. UITERWYK: There is two issues. Number

3        1,1 have had no notice. I haven't reviewed this.

4       This is something that they are going to give you

5       now that's going to be reviewed over the weekend.

6       And I think it's inappropriate for them to pop

7       this on me in the courtroom at 5 o'clock on a

8       Friday afternoon with regard to a deposition that

9       you are reviewing.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=396
10            One more thing. And that is, this particular

11        witness, Dr. Robinson, was designated as a

12       corporate representative. It's like he is -- what

13       he says is what he's saying on behalf of the

14       corporation. Anything that he says in a

15       deposition on behalf of the corporation is not

16       cumulative to what an expert witness is going to

17       be saying before the trial. You know that they

18       are going to be talking to the jury about the

19       expert witness, and about maybe the biases he may

20       have or about -- we all know about the instruction

21        as it goes to the expert witnesses. It can not in

22       any way be cumulative to what Dr. Robinson is

23       saying in his deposition as the designated

24       corporate rep. And I object to them presenting it

25       to you now. 3304

1            THE COURT: You know what? I'm not going to

2       review the addition objections, because that would

3       prompt plaintiffs counsel from -- to issue a

4       reply to those cumulatives. So I'm just going to

5       review it the way it is. So your request is

6       denied.

7            MR. PEDROSA: All right. Judge, just -

8            THE COURT: You can file the papers.

9            MR. PEDROSA: Okay. I think they have

10       already been filed.

11             THE COURT: Okay.

12            MR. PEDROSA: Just so Your Honor knows, the

13       cumulative objections were in our original

14       objections that were served and exchanged with the

15       deadlines for deposition designations. We just

16       didn't highlight them because Your Honor had

17       previously said that you couldn't rule on

18       cumulative type objections until you had heard the

19       evidence. What we are doing here is basically

20       adding them back in. They were in our original

21        objections as served back in December when the

22       deadline came about. They are just not marked on

23       your binder, based on the fact that Your Honor had

24       said that you couldn't rule on cumulative

25       objections until evidence started coming in. Now 3305

1        that evidence has started coming in --

2            We're talking about six hours of video right

3       now, which -- some of which we contend is

4       cumulative. So that's the only thing we are

5       trying to accomplish with this.

6            THE COURT: All right. Well, maybe -

7            You know, I get bits and pieces, and then I

8       make a ruling, and then I get the rest of the --

9       and here is the rest of the story.

10            You are too young to know what that means.

11             MR. PEDROSA: I actually do know what it

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=397
12       means, Judge. And my intention was not to argue

13       this at any length. And that's why I didn't go

14       into the whole background.

15            THE COURT: So you are representing to me

16       that these were designations that were previously

17       made?

18            MR. PEDROSA: The designations we made back

19       in December. We objected in December.

20            THE COURT: I said, these were objections

21        which were previously made and not -- are not

22       being made now?

23            MR. PEDROSA: I did the objections myself for

24       this video, and I asserted cumulative objections

25       where I believed, kind of predicting what other 3306

1        evidence would come in, would be cumulative.

2            THE COURT: And when did you to that?

3            MR. PEDROSA: I did that back in December.

4       Now --

5            THE COURT: Based upon plaintiff s

6       designations?

7            MR. PEDROSA: Based on plaintiff s

8       designations as my belief as to what other

9       witnesses would likely testify.

10            THE COURT: Right.

11             MR. PEDROSA: I knew, for example, Dr.

12       Cummings was going to come in here and talk about

13       the Frank Statement.

14            THE COURT: Okay.

15            MR. PEDROSA: So I objected to the Frank

16       Statement section of Dr. Robinson because it's

17       cumulative.

18            What I cannot represent to the Court is that

19       this is identical, because I've had --1 had

20       people, while we have been here, go through and

21        delete things that Dr. Cummings hasn't testified

22       to yet, and if there's something I didn't

23       anticipate at the time he might testify to but he

24       did in fact testify to, to add it in. So I'm --

25       unfortunately, I'm not in a position to tell you 3307

1        it is line by line.

2            THE COURT: Okay.

3            MR. PEDROSA: But I am in a position to tell

4       you that the starting point for this were the

5       objections that I myself --

6            THE COURT: Okay. So I can't tell which ones

7       you asserted earlier and which ones you asserted

8       now?

9            MR. PEDROSA: I would be happy to resend a

10       version of this that deletes anything that's new.

11             THE COURT: No. I'm going to do the best I

12       can.

13            MR. TRENTALANGE: Your Honor, can I point

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=398
14       something out to the Court that I think would be

15       expeditious?

16            I accept counsel's representation of every

17       one of those designations that he's handing up

18       today is an area of Dr. Cummings testimony that

19       his client will touch on. It can't be cumulative.

20       His client will either disagree with what Dr.

21        Cummings has to say, in which case the jury will

22       be entitled to know about that disagreement, but

23       from the party, or the party will agree, in which

24       case the jury will know that the party agrees with

25       what Dr. Cummings said. 3308

1            THE COURT: Yeah.

2            MR. TRENTALANGE: So those portions are the

3       most relevant and most important portions of the

4       testimony. The testimony of a party defendant

5       cannot be cumulative to anybody else in the case.

6            THE COURT: Okay. I'm not going to review

7       it.

8            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, what I would

9       suggest then, based on what Mr. Trentalange has

10       said, just so that I can have a ruling on my

11        objections, it sounds like we don't have a

12       disagreement that these are cumulative, let's say,

13       in fact, in that they cover the same topics. His

14       argument is that as a matter of law.

15            THE COURT: All right. Let me make it easy.

16       Okay? He's not -- my understanding is he

17       accepted -- he's not agreeing that -- he's

18       accepting your statement that -- as to when you

19       made these objections. He's not agreeing that

20       they are, in fact, valid. And based upon what he

21        said in terms of that they cannot be cumulative,

22       that's my -- that's my ruling. And so --

23            MR. PEDROSA: That's your ruling. So you are

24       overruling my objections on that ground?

25            THE COURT: Correct. 3309

1            MR. PEDROSA: That's what I was suggesting.

2            THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

3            MR. PEDROSA: All right. Thank you.

4            THE COURT: All right. Anything else we need

5       to take up now so that we could make the trial go

6       more smoothly next week?

7            MR. UITERWYK: I think, Judge, we started

8       today, I think your idea of an all-cases order.

9       We saw today how much more -- how much more? --

10       yeah, how much more smoother his testimony went

11        once we got resolved on the exhibits. And I think

12       it's a great idea that we do that, all that.

13            THE COURT: Well, you know -- okay. Well,

14       that's fine.

15            MR. TRENTALANGE: The short answer is no,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=399
16       Judge. Nothing else.

17            THE COURT: Yeah.

18            MR. WALKER: Nothing I can think of either,

19       Judge.

20            THE COURT: All right. Have a nice weekend.

21             MR. WALKER: You too, Judge.

22            MR. PEDROSA: You as well.

3            THE COURT: Good morning. Good Monday

4       morning.

5            Mr. Pedrosa, here is your binder.

6            MR. PEDROSA: Thank you, sir. We'll get a

7       copy.

8            MR. UITERWYK: If you can. I've got to get

9       it to down to Baron's people and we've got to

10       cut --

11             MR. PEDROSA: I have talked to Baron about

12       that.

14            MRPHILIPSON: Yeah.

15            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

16            THE COURT: Be seated. Thank you.

17            MR. WALKER: Judge, are you feeling any

18       better?

19            THE COURT: A little bit. Thank you.

20            MR. WALKER: Good.

21             THE COURT: How are you?

22            MR. WALKER: So far so good.

23            THE COURT: Juror No. 6, Edward Macht,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=403
24       M-A-C-H-T, told my bailiff that he wanted to speak

25       with me. I have no idea what it's about. So 3316

1        we're going to call him in and have him say in

2       open court what he wants to tell me.

3            Anybody have any objection to that?

4            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor.

5            MR. UITERWYK: None.

6            THE COURT: Okay. All right. Ask him to

7       come in, please. Just have him take his seat.

8            THE BAILIFF: Okay.

9            (Juror Edward Macht entered the courtroom.)

10            THE COURT: Good morning, Mr. Macht. Be

11        seated. Thank you. How are you this morning?

12            JUROR MACHT: Fine, Your Honor.

13            THE COURT: I understand from my bailiff that

14       you wanted to tell me something.

15            THE WITNESS: Yes, sir. May I approach the

16       bench?

17            THE COURT: Yes, certainly.

18            (At the bench)

19            JUROR MACHT: I don't know if this has

20       anything to do with anything. It certainly

21        doesn't with me, but I feel like I need to tell

22       you. I was reading a newspaper Saturday morning,

23       reading about the Bubba/Schnitt, and

24       Mr. Trentalange's name popped up in the article.

25       As soon as I saw his name, I just quit reading the 3317

1        article.

2            THE COURT: Okay.

3            JUROR MACHT: I just wanted to let the -

4            THE COURT: Okay. Well, I appreciate that.

5       I need to let the lawyers know about that.

6            JUROR MACHT: Yes, sir.

7            THE COURT: So - and that's it?

8            JUROR MACHT: Yes, sir. That's all.

9            THE COURT: Okay.

10            JUROR MACHT: I just wanted to-

11             THE COURT: We appreciate that. If you

12       wouldn't mind just resuming your seat.

13            JUROR MACHT: Yes, sir.

14            THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Macht.

15            (In open court)

16            THE COURT: Mr. Macht advised me that he was

17       reading the newspaper on Saturday about the

18       Schnitt/Bubba the Love Sponge, Clem, litigation

19       and noticed that Mr. Trentalange was a witness in

20       the motion for mistrial that was heard by Judge

21        Arnold on Friday. And Mr. Macht advised me that

22       as soon as he read that, he put down the article.

23            Anything further?

24            MR. UITERWYK: Nothing from the plaintiff,

25       Your Honor.

3318

1            MR. WALKER: Nothing from us, Your Honor.

2            THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Pedrosa?

3            MR. PEDROSA: No, sir.

4            THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Macht, we appreciate

5       you bringing that to our attention. That's fine.

6       And you can go back into the jury room. Thank you

7       so much.

8            JUROR MACHT: Okay.

9            (Juror Edward Macht retired from the

10       courtroom.)

11            THE COURT: Okay. Are we ready to -- is the

12       witness here?

13            MR. UITERWYK: He is, Your Honor.

14            THE COURT: Are we ready to proceed?

15            MR. UITERWYK: I'm missing my client. She's

16       caught in the line.

17            THE COURT: Okay.

18            MR. UITERWYK: I know that the line was out

19       to the parking lot when I went around it.

20            Your Honor, while we're doing that, you asked

21        us to give you some kind of timing. And I believe

22       everything is going according to plan, which is 

23            THE COURT: Which it never does.

24            MR. UITERWYK: I beg your pardon?

25            THE COURT: Which it never does. 3319

1            MR. UITERWYK: I know. But I have to do

2       something. Friday morning is when I think we'll

3       be done.

4            THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Walker, about how many

5       days do you think your case is going to take?

6            MR. WALKER: Approximately four, Judge.

7            THE COURT: Four days. Mr. Pedrosa?

8            MR. PEDROSA: I think Mr. Walker's estimate

9       is for the total defense case.

10            THE COURT: Okay.

11             MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

12            MR. PEDROSA: I think it's right for all of

13       the defendants.

14            THE COURT: Okay. That would put us right at

15       the end of next week.

16            MR. UITERWYK: We're going to try to get it

17       done by Thursday, but I just wanted to --

18            THE COURT: Okay. Well --

19            MR. WALKER: I would just ask that the jury

20       be so advised, because I think what Your Honor

21        originally told them was maybe that Tuesday.

22            THE COURT: Yes, I will tell them that.

23            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Your Honor.

24            THE COURT: That's fine.

25            MR. WALKER: Am I safe not having a witness 3320

1       here until Friday?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=405
2            THE COURT: Let's take it a little bit

3       further into the week before I do that.

4            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

5            THE COURT: At least maybe some time

6       tomorrow, so that --1 would hate to give up -- if

7       it's -- we miss it by an hour or two, it's not

8       that big a deal. If we miss it by a half a day or

9       more, then it could be. So --

10            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

11             THE COURT: Okay.

12            MR. WALKER: Thank you. May we ask for a

13       little bit more information about the upcoming

14       lineup?

15            THE COURT: Sure.

16            MR. WALKER: At least for tomorrow and --

17            MR. UITERWYK: I will know tomorrow,

18       depending on how far we get today. I mean, I will

19       tell them this afternoon who the lineup will be.

20            THE COURT: Okay.

21             MR. UITERWYK: But we're planning on Jack

22       Smith and Amber so far. I don't know how much

23       he's going to go into tomorrow with his cross with

24       Dr. Cummings, so it's kind of -- we're waffling on

25       that a little bit. But I think Jack Smith will be 3321

1        one and Amber will be the only other one, and if

2       we have to, we can always have Cindy as well. But

3       we also have the deposition. Hopefully, we'll

4       have the cuts done.

5            THE COURT: I don't know who these people are

6       without a last name.

7            MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I'm

8       sorry. Jack Smith is the brother of Ms. Loyd, and

9       Amber Norris is the daughter, one of the daughters

10       of Ms. Loyd.

11             THE COURT: Okay. That was a subtle dig, but

12       I guess --

13            MR. SEIDEN: I got it, Your Honor.

14            MR. PEDROSA: It wasn't that subtle, Your

15       Honor.

16            THE COURT: Does anybody know the phrase --1

17       said this to -- maybe this side of the room

18       wouldn't know it, but maybe the other side might.

19       You said if things go according to plan. I said

20       in a hearing, well -- about a couple weeks ago,

21        according to Hoyle, and nobody knew who I was

22       talking about.

23            MR. TRENTALANGE: Come on. Hoyle has got to

24       do with the rules for cards.

25            THE COURT: Yeah. You younger lawyers, have 3322

1        you heard of that phrase, "according to Hoyle"?

2            MR. SEIDEN: When you said it, I thought, on

3       the deck. I thought, obviously, on the deck of

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=406
4       the cover for cards. I thought that was a

5       reference.

6            THE COURT: Yeah. He's the --

7            MR. SEIDEN: It's a bridge reference?

8            THE COURT: Bridge and other card games. He

9       was like Prosser on Torts or something. You know,

10       according to Hoyle. But, I mean, it was a phrase,

11        and--

12            MR. TRENTALANGE: He's who you refer to when

13       you want to figure out whether a full house beats

14       a straight or straight flush.

15            THE COURT: Yeah, yeah. So--but people

16       were looking at me like, What are you talking

17       about?

18            All right. Are we ready now?

19            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah, we are, Judge.

20            THE COURT: Okay. Bring the jury in, please.

21             Your witness, Dr. Cummings, is here?

22            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah, he's here.

23            THE COURT: Okay.

24            (The witness returned to the stand.)

25            THE COURT: Good morning. 3323

1            THE WITNESS: Good morning.

2            (The jury returned to the courtroom

3       9:09 a.m.)

4            THE COURT: Thank you. You may be seated.

5            Good morning to you all. Happy good Monday

6       to you. We appreciate your patience, and we're

7       ready to continue.

8            Just for planning purposes, I know I told you

9       during jury selection that the case would go three

10       weeks and possibly into the fourth week a

11        couple --1 don't know exactly what I said, but I

12       may have indicated a couple of days.

13            As I explained to you, there are a lot of

14       technical rules that I'm required to rule on,

15       technical matters I'm required to rule on, and

16       it's extremely unlikely that we would finish

17       before the end of next week. So we're probably

18       going to use all of next week.

19            Of course, if I'm -- it won't go beyond that,

20       but if I'm wrong, it would be sooner than that.

21        But in order for you to make whatever plans you

22       need to make, it's important that you know that.

23       So if it's sooner than that, of course, I will

24       advise you accordingly. But for planning

25       purposes, it's likely that we will be in court 3324

1        through the end of next week. So I thought I

2       would let you know that as soon as I -- as soon as

3       I could.

4            We're ready to continue, Mr. Uiterwyk.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Thank you, Your Honor. May it

6       please the Court.

7            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

8                CONTINUED DIRECT EXAMINATION

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Good morning, Dr. Cummings.

11        A.   Good morning.

12       Q.   When we broke off, I believe, on Friday

13   afternoon, I think we were talking about at that time,

14   and we got -- we talked about the meeting and then we

15   started talking about the cover-up and we started

16   talking about what the cigarette companies knew and

17   what they did or did not disclose during that time

18   frame. And I think we were actually examining some

19   documents by a Dr. Rodgman from RJR regarding that

20   disclosure, and talked about --1 believe we discussed

21    also whether they had disclosed it to anyone outside of

22   the company and warned anybody about the disclosure

23   regarding PAHs.

24            The next document I want us to look at, if we

25   could, please, Dr. Cummings, is 1608, a letter on 3325

1   Reynolds' stationery dated July 30th, 1957. Can you

2   tell the jury what this document is and who is whom, or

3   who is who?

4       A.   Sure. This is a letter from Ed Garr,

5   president of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, to Paul

6   Hahn, president of American Tobacco Company. And he's

7   commenting on the successful effort of the creation of

8   the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and their

9   public relations efforts that had taken place since

10    1953 through 1957.

11        Q.   And TIRC is the entity that's -- was the

12   signature that was created during the meeting, correct?

13   In'53?

14       A.   Correct.

15       Q.   You took a bold and courageous action in

16   December 1953 when you called for a meeting of

17   manufacturers and other industry groups to discuss ways

18   and means of presenting a united front against the

19   claims that were being made that cigarette smoking

20   causes lung cancer. The formation of the Tobacco

21    Industry Research Committee was the result.

22            There is absolutely no question in my mind

23   that if this committee had not been formed, the

24   cigarette industry by now would have been in a

25   deplorable position. Instead, a very fine job has been 3326

1    done in counteracting unverified, unjustified and

2   unsubstantiated claims of the anti-cigarette fanatics.

3   In other words, the TIRC has been a successful

4   defensive operation.

5            Let me talk to you a little bit about a

6   couple things that are said in there. Were there --

7   very briefly. Did they themselves verify as of this

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=408
8   date, had already verified and substantiated some of

9   those claims made by what they call the anti-cigarette

10   fanatics?

11        A.   Yes, they had.

12       Q.   And is this one of the documents we looked

13   at, for instance, with Dr. Rodgman?

14       A.   Well, Dr. Teague in 1953 had done their

15   literature review, the 1956 Rodgman review of the

16   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that had been

17   identified in cigarette smoke, including

18   benzo[a]pyrene, a suspect carcinogen, had been isolated

19   from the smoke of the Camel cigarettes, as well as the

20   document we reviewed from Dr. Senkus to -- or to

21    Mr. Hoover, the head of research at R.J. Reynolds,

22   where they had found the levels of polycyclic aromatic

23   hydrocarbons two and a half times higher in the blend

24   of Winston cigarettes compared to the blend of Camel.

25       Q.   Now, during your research of these activities 3327

1    of the cigarette companies, did you during -- shortly

2   around this time frame or shortly thereafter, did you

3   determine based on some interviews that had been done

4   and so forth about what did the cigarette companies

5   know and what they had been told about smoking and the

6   relationship with cancer that was, in fact, in regard

7   to the visit by the British American Tobacco Company?

8       A.   Yeah. There was a visit by three scientists

9   from one of the tobacco companies, British American

10   Tobacco and their affiliated organizations. They owned

11    companies all over the world, including

12   Brown & Williamson in the United States. And they had

13   interviewed over 40 scientists. They had gone to speak

14   to the scientists of some of the major cigarette

15   companies. They went to talk to the scientists who

16   were part of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee

17   scientific advisory board. These minutes were widely

18   shared, including shared with R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

19   Company, and they had concluded that on the question --

20            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

21             THE WITNESS: -- of whether smoking caused --

22            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Hearsay.

23       The referenced document was excluded under Your

24       Honor's ruling. You sustained the hearsay

25       objections. 3328

1            THE COURT: All right. Sustained.

2   BY MR. UITERWYK:

3       Q.   All right. Dr. Cummings, did the tobacco

4   companies jointly -- basically, at some point in time

5   during 1958, did it become the consensus within the

6   industry that, in fact, cigarette smoking did cause

7   lung cancer?

8       A.   Yes.

9       Q.   And was this something that the companies

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=409
10   knew among themselves?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Did they do anything to disseminate this

13   information? Did they ever go out and say, You know

14   what? What we said in the Frank Statement in 1953 is

15   wrong.

16            MR. WALKER: Objection. Argumentative.

17            THE COURT: Overruled.

18   BY MR. UITERWYK:

19       Q.   Go ahead.

20       A.   No, they did not.

21        Q.   And did they still continue even to do more

22   research with regard to cancer causing agents and the

23   relationship between smoking and cancer?

24       A.   Yes, they did.

25            MR. UITERWYK: And if we could look at 2141, 3329

1       please.

2   BY MR. UITERWYK:

3       Q.   Is this another document by Dr. Rodgman

4   addressed to Mr. Hoover?

5       A.   Right.  1953 -- or '59. Excuse me.

6       Q.   Okay. And this is an RJR document again?

7       A.   This is an R.J. Reynolds internal document,

8   yes, it is.

9       Q.   And this was authored by Dr. Rodgman?

10       A.   It was.

11        Q.   And if we look at page 3, Bates page 3, if we

12   look at some of the conclusions of Dr. Rodgman -- and

13   he was telling this to Mr. Hoover. And who is

14   Mr. Hoover?

15       A.   Director of research at R.J. Reynolds.

16       Q.   And if we could look at page 3. He's talking

17   about there, he says, Cigarette smoking should contain

18   as little as possible, preferably at the zero level, of

19   polycyclic hydrocarbons --

20            The same thing as polycyclic aromatic

21    hydrocarbons, right?

22       A.   Correct.

23       Q.   And then he says down at the bottom, the

24   asterisk, the footnote: We consider the zero level to

25   be impossible to achieve as long as the combustion 3330

1   temperature of the cigarette is greater than

2   700 degrees Celsius.

3            What is the combustion level temperature of

4   the cigarette?

5       A.   Over 800 degrees Celsius. So essentially

6   they were -- he was acknowledging they can't remove --

7            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning

8       and intent. The document speaks for itself.

9            THE COURT: Sustained.

10   BY MR. UITERWYK:

11        Q.   Can -- have they lowered the temperature of

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=410
12   cigarettes below 700 degrees Celsius?

13       A.   No.

14       Q.   You mentioned with regard to the manipulation

15   that they, in fact -- they control the burn rate, do

16   they not?

17       A.   Correct.

18       Q.   And they -- and so is it always at

19   800 degrees or more?

20       A.   Typically, yes.

21        Q.   All right. And so when he said cigarette

22   smoke should contain as little of poly cyclic aromatic

23   hydrocarbons, we consider zero level to be impossible,

24   from a scientific view, do you understand what was

25   being said there, that they couldn't reduce the level 3331

1   to 700 degrees and therefore they couldn't get the

2   polycyclic hydrocarbons to zero?

3            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning

4       and intent. The document speaks for itself.

5            THE COURT: Sustained.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Doctor, based on your research as it relates

8   to cigarettes in relation to the cigarettes that we

9   talked about and the burn rate of cigarettes that we

10   talked about before, did they reduce it to below

11    700 degrees?

12       A.   No.

13       Q.   And as a result, did they remove the

14   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons?

15       A.   No.

16       Q.   Then they go on. It relates more to the

17   issue of the design, engineering, manipulation. They

18   say, Sufficient nicotine to supply the necessary

19   requirements --

20            Well, let me go on.

21             Should -- cigarette smoke should contain as

22   little as possible of the polycyclic hydrocarbon,

23   should possess satisfactory flavor to please the

24   consumer, and should contain sufficient nicotine to

25   supply the necessary requirements of the smoker with 3332

1   respect to this compound.

2            Is that what we were discussing last week

3   about the manipulation?

4       A.   We were talking about the optimum

5   composition. So this is the optimum composition.

6   Reduce the polycyclics but make sure you have a

7   sufficient amount of the nicotine to keep somebody

8   smoking. They're talking about extraction of nicotine

9   and putting it back.

10            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning

11        and intent.

12            THE COURT: Overruled.

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=411
14       Q.   And should have a flavor comparable with that

15   of the CamelAVinston blend and should yield nicotine in

16   the smoke in an amount ranging from 1.5 to

17   2.0 milligrams per cigarette.

18            Is this what you're referring to as the

19   optimum level?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Okay. And then he goes on.

22            The physiological requirements of the smoker

23   with respect to nicotine can be met by the application

24   of the optimum amount of nicotine to the extracted

25   tobacco. 3333

1             Can you explain in laymen's terms what the

2   application of the optimum amount of the nicotine to

3   the extracted tobacco means?

4       A.   Sure.

5       Q.   In connection with the manufacturing process.

6       A.   Sure. He's talking about the reconstituted

7   tobacco, the extracted tobacco. You take the nicotine

8   out, and you're talking about putting it in back in,

9   into the product. So they can take it out, and they're

10   talking about putting it in at this optimum amount that

11    they had described in this memo.

12       Q.   Okay. Let's look at another document, if we

13   could. 2378.

14            First of all, can you set up the background

15   of this document and explain to the jury?

16       A.   Sure. This is a presentation by Dr. Helmut

17   Wakeham, who is the director of research at

18   R.J. Reynolds, to the research and development

19   committee on the issue of tobacco and health, R and D

20   approach, where he does a presentation about what they

21   knew about carcinogens in the product and their ability

22   to remove those carcinogens that have been identified

23   from the product.

24       Q.   And Dr. Wakeham, what relationship did he

25   have to TIRC, T-I-R-C? 3334

1        A.   He was on the technical research committee.

2   He had replaced, actually, Dr. DuPuis. We had seen

3   Dr. DuPuis in the See It Now video.

4       Q.   Is that the one with the oscilloscope?

5       A.   Exactly. He retired in 1960 from

6   Philip Morris, and Dr. Wakeham came in as the director

7   of research.

8       Q.   And this is a 1961 document?

9       A.   Correct.

10       Q.   Now, let's, if we could, go to Bates 12,

11   please. Carcinogen.

12            Can you blow that up, please, Baron?

13            A substance which, if applied to the tissue

14   of a test animal, gives rise to tumor formation. In

15   tests of carcinogens, it is assumed that tumors

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=412
16   ultimately lead to cancerous growths and that a

17   carcinogen so demonstrated in test animals is dangerous

18   to man.

19            Is this the conclusion that he had in this

20   report?

21        A.   Well, he's giving definitions here to

22   different terms. And so for the purposes of the

23   presentation, he was just defining the different

24   terms -- carcinogen, tumor promoter, and some other

25   terms -- which he later describes. 3335

1            You can see this chart, which is the partial

2   list of some of the compounds that have now been

3   identified as carcinogens in cigarettes. And the

4   little plus signs relates to a scoring system based on

5   these animal experiments in terms of the potency. So

6   the more plus signs, it was more highly carcinogenic in

7   the animal models when they would paint the tar extract

8   onto the backs of the animals.

9       Q.   This is in 1961?

10       A.   Yeah. You can see the list is much larger

11    than -- because the chemistry had gotten better and

12   they were isolating more and more chemicals. Not only

13   the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but other classes

14   of carcinogens were being identified as well. The

15   tobacco specific nitrosamines and other things as well.

16   Metals, for example.

17       Q.   And did they discuss or did he discuss the

18   reduction of carcinogens in that particular -- in that

19   article?

20       A.   Yeah. I mean, he's outlining some strategies

21    that they could take. And one of the slides that he

22   prepared was in order to make the cigarettes, to lower

23   the carcinogen levels, he basically says carcinogens

24   are found in practically every class of compounds in

25   smoke, and the present technology in 1961 does not 3336

1   permit selective filtration of the particulate smoke.

2            In other words, they couldn't take out

3   everything that they were finding.

4       Q.   Could they take out the carcinogens?

5       A.   No.

6       Q.   And did they know that in 1961?

7       A.   They knew it in 1959. That was Dr. Rodgman.

8   And Dr. Wakeham is essentially saying the same thing at

9   Philip Morris.

10       Q.   And in spite of knowing that at the time, did

11    members of the TIRC at this time, or The Tobacco

12   Institute as well, come out on TV after this and still

13   say they haven't identified anything harmful?

14       A.   The TIRC basically said that they hadn't

15   identified anything in sufficient quantities that would

16   be harmful to human health, that more research was

17   needed. That was essentially the line that they had.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=413
18       Q.   Did they also have lines that if we did find

19   anything like they did here, that they would remove it?

20            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

21             THE COURT: Sustained.

22   BY MR. UITERWYK:

23       Q.   What did they say -- what did they say in

24   public as to what they would do if they did find it?

25       A.   They told the public if they found anything 3337

1   that was harmful to human health, they would remove it.

2       Q.   All right. Let's look at another document,

3   3709 A, if we could, please.

4            Is this Dr. Rodgman again from Reynolds?

5       A.   Yes. 1962.

6       Q.   And what's this a document about, Doctor?

7       A.   Basically, he's updating what he did

8   regularly, reports on the smoking and health issue. So

9   this is a literature review that has over 100

10   citations. And it's basically reviewing the evidence

11    on chemistry, on animal studies, and human clinical

12   studies in relationship to smoking and health.

13       Q.   And what does he conclude in this particular

14   document as it relates to the health hazards of

15   cigarettes?

16       A.   He said the evidence to date, obviously, the

17   amount of evidence accumulated to indict cigarette

18   smoke as a health hazard is overwhelming and the

19   evidence challenging such an indictment is scant.

20       Q.   Was this conclusion released to the public?

21        A.   No.

22       Q.   Did they -- as a result of this, all this

23   information coming out in the fifties, early sixties,

24   did they put any warnings, voluntarily put any warnings

25   on the cigarette packs? 3338

1        A.   No.

2       Q.   Did they put any warnings in the fifties,

3   early sixties on any of the cigarette packs?

4       A.   No, they did not.

5       Q.   Was this an opportunity, when they started to

6   find this out, for them to make a choice?

7            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

8       Argumentative.

9            THE COURT: Sustained.

10   BY MR. UITERWYK:

11        Q.   All right. Now, in addition to this internal

12   research, did they contract out other research as well?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   And was there a project called the Battelle

15   project? Are you familiar with that?

16       A.   Yes, I am. Battelle is the contract lab.

17       Q.   Tell the jury what that was about. Where was

18   that contract lab?

19       A.   Well, Battelle has offices all over the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=414
20   world, but in the early 1960s, Battelle in Switzerland

21    had been hired to do research on basically why people

22   smoke and examine the effects of nicotine as an

23   addictive substance. And they funded literature

24   searches; they funded Battelle to do animal and human

25   experimental studies. 3339

1        Q.   And while this was going on in the sixties,

2   was the Surgeon General in the process of getting

3   together the information necessary for their report

4   that was issued in 1964?

5       A.   Yes. The Surgeon General's -- you know, the

6   stimulus for that report, John F. Kennedy, president at

7   the time in 1962, was asked about a report that had

8   come out in Great Britain in March of 1962, the Royal

9   College, by a reporter. And that reporter asked him

10   about the study, and he didn't really know anything

11    about it. And he said we would have our U.S. Public

12   Health Service look into it.

13            And basically beginning in the summer of 1962

14   through January of 1964, an advisory committee was

15   appointed, and the government, led by the Surgeon

16   General, asked all the tobacco companies to turn over

17   information on what they knew about the health risks of

18   smoking and factors involved in smoking behavior to the

19   advisory committee that was putting together the U.S.

20   Surgeon General's report.

21        Q.   And let's look at the response with regard to

22   that -- or the information as it relates to that.

23   Let's look first at 1524, Tab 124.

24            Now, this was addressed to

25   Brown & Williamson. They're now owned by RJR, correct? 3340

1        A.   That's correct.

2       Q.   And was Brown & Williamson kind of like --

3   kind of led this Battelle project?

4       A.   Yes, they did. It was their parent

5   organization, British American Tobacco, that led that,

6   but they shared that with all their affiliates,

7   including Brown & Williamson here in the United States.

8       Q.   And did they share that, the information,

9   also with RJR?

10       A.   Brown & Williamson did. Yes, they did.

11        Q.   All right. And if we could look at what --

12   who is White & Case?

13       A.   They were outside counsel for

14   Brown & Williamson, so they're a law firm.

15       Q.   All right. And what is he talking about here

16   in general?

17       A.   Essentially they're talking about what

18   information they're going to turn over. The date of

19   the article or this letter is significant, because it's

20   May of 1963.

21             So the Surgeon General's scientific advisory

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=415
22   committee is actively meeting, they're gathering

23   material for their report, and the companies have all

24   received letters asking each of the companies to turn

25   over information. 3341

1             So he's referencing what Brown & Williamson

2   would be turning over to the -- the Surgeon General

3   advisory committee.

4            MR. UITERWYK: Can we see the paragraph above

5       that, Baron?

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Did he say, Please find enclosed the

8   substance of a proposed letter to the Surgeon General,

9   in that letter?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   And did he say, I'm of the further opinion

12   that any description in the letter to the committee of

13   the methods and steps involved in the various

14   scientific research programs conducted by

15   Brown & Williamson must necessarily be so vague and

16   incomplete as to be irksome to the reader?

17            Did I read that correctly?

18       A.   You did.

19       Q.   And then he goes on. Therefore --

20            If we go to the bottom there. Therefore.

21    Up, up, up. Therefore.

22            Do you see under --

23       A.   Do you want me to read it?

24       Q.   Therefore, it is my suggestion.

25       A.   Yeah. Sure. Therefore, it is my suggestion 3342

1   that we state simply that we have conducted no medical

2   research, having left that to the TIRC, and then

3   proceed to enumerate the various scientific research

4   programs sponsored or financed by Brown & Williamson,

5   without commenting upon them, and informing the Surgeon

6   General's committee that in the event any particular

7   program is of interest to the committee, it may be

8   assured of Brown & Williamson's full cooperation. In

9   the event a program proves to be of interest to the

10   committee and a request for details is made, we will

11    meet that problem when it arises.

12            I repeat, it is unfortunate that

13   Brown & Williamson must submit anything, but this

14   approach seems to me to be the most innocuous of the

15   alternatives. I have enclosed a copy of Bowman Gray's

16   letter about which I spoke to you.

17            Reynolds' handling of the matter is, of

18   course, simplified by its being in a position to

19   deliver a considerable amount of published matter.

20       Q.   And did he also, in the next page, conclude,

21    From a litigation standpoint? The last paragraph.

22       A.   Sure. From a litigation standpoint, I

23   believe it is axiomatic that it is best to submit the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=416
24   least scientific material possible, consonant with the

25   objective of not irritating the committee. As I 3343

1   mentioned on the telephone, I would prefer to see only

2   previously published material submitted, if you find

3   you have enough such material to warrant submitting it.

4   I await the outcome of your research in that regard.

5       Q.   Was this what they -- what this White and

6   Case was -- was this consistent with what they promised

7   to do in the Frank Statement?

8       A.   No. They promised in the Frank Statement to

9   work with the medical authorities.

10       Q.   And who is Mr. Yeaman?

11        A.   Addison Yeaman was the chief general counsel

12   for Brown & Williamson. He also served on the law

13   committee, the committee on counsel that oversaw the

14   activities of the Council for Tobacco Research, TIRC.

15   It's the same organization; they just changed their

16   name.

17       Q.   And did he get involved in connection with

18   the disclosure of the information of this Battelle

19   project that was being done?

20       A.   Yes, he did.

21        Q.   And did he prepare a memorandum in that

22   regard, a strictly privately and confidential

23   memorandum?

24       A.   Yes. Summarizing the findings with the

25   Battelle Hippo study. 3344

1        Q.   And what was the Green Monster?

2       A.   The Green Monster? The Green Monster was a

3   compilation of about 6,000 abstracts of articles that

4   had been published in the scientific literature on

5   smoking and health. It was actually produced by

6   scientists at the University of Virginia Medical

7   School, Larson, Haag and Silvette.

8            Larson was actually on the payroll of

9   American Tobacco. Dr. Haag received, going back into

10   the 1940s, funding from American Tobacco.

11             And they put together this compilation of

12   material. And they called it the Green Monster,

13   because it has a green cover. And it covers issues

14   related to smoking and health, a lot of topics. No

15   conclusions whatsoever. So it didn't try to summarize

16   and say, Well, based on the evidence, smoking causes X,

17   Y or Z. There were no conclusions. It was just a list

18   of the abstracts of the articles showing that, in fact,

19   that they were tracking these articles.

20       Q.   And is that what that letter referred to when

21    they referenced in there about Bowman Gray's letter?

22       A.   Well, certainly -- no, not entirely. The

23   TIRC did turn over the material from the Green Monster,

24   and it's actually cited in the introduction of the

25   Surgeon General's report, because they used -- there

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=417
3345

1   was a list of the articles that have been published.

2   So it was helpful in review. But Reynolds turned over

3   a list of some of the work that they had done on

4   identifying, you know, chemicals in cigarette smoke, as

5   did Philip Morris.

6            Their statement essentially said that none of

7   the chemicals had been found in the amounts that have

8   been identified to be harmful to human health. That's

9   what they concluded in their communications to the

10   Surgeon General's committee.

11        Q.   And going back to the Yeaman discussions that

12   we were having with respect to the Battelle project, I

13   had asked you --1 believe you said they prepared a

14   memo. Is what we see on the screen, 3615, strictly

15   private and confidential, is that the memo that he

16   prepared?

17       A.   Yeah. This was the memo you had asked me

18   about from -- written by Addison Yeaman from

19   Brown & Williamson that was summarizing implications of

20   the Battelle research that had been done over in

21    Switzerland, as well as the Griffith filter.

22   Dr. Griffith was the head of R&D at Brown & Williamson.

23       Q.   Let's go back, if we could, to Bates 2.

24            MR PHILIPSON: 2?

25            MR. UITERWYK: Bates 2, yes. 3346

1   BY MR. UITERWYK:

2       Q.   And did he point out at that time that TIRC

3   cannot, in my opinion, provide a vehicle for such

4   research? What research was he referring to?

5            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning

6       and intent.

7            THE COURT: Overruled.

8            THE WITNESS: He's referencing on the prior

9       page the research having to do with smoking and

10       health that would be turned over to the Surgeon

11        General's committee, and said that TIRC cannot, in

12       my opinion, provide the vehicle for such research.

13       It was conceived of as a public relations gesture.

14       However, on the file, the Scientific Advisory

15       Board in its grant, SAB, it functioned as a public

16       relations operation.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   All right. And then if you go on, starting

19   on page Bates 4 --

20            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I'm sorry. Under

21        the rule of completeness, may we have read the

22       rest of that paragraph?

23            THE COURT: Yes.

24            THE WITNESS: Moreover, its organization,

25       certainly in its present form, does not allow the 3347

1       breadth of research, cancer, emphysema,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=418
2       cardiovascular disorders, etc., essential to the

3       protection of the tobacco industry. I suggest

4       that in the new research effort, we enlist the

5       cooperation of the Surgeon General, of the Public

6       Health Service, the American Cancer Society, the

7       Heart Association, the American Medical

8       Association, and any and all other responsible

9       health agencies or medical and scientific

10       associations concerned with the question of

11        tobacco and health. The new effort should be

12       conducted by a new organization lavishly financed,

13       autonomous, self-perpetuating and uncontrolled,

14       save that its efforts be confined to the single

15       problem of the relation of tobacco to human

16       health.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   Did they do an autonomous, self-perpetuating,

19   uncontrolled, lavishly financed organization?

20       A.   No. They did finance the American Medical

21    Association. I think the Educational Research Fund was

22   funded beginning in '63. So AM A took money and came to

23   the same conclusion that the U.S. Surgeon General had

24   in'64.

25       Q.   All right. Did they provide -- strike that. 3348

1            Let's go on to what he concluded with regard

2   to nicotine in this report about the Battelle project.

3            MR. WALKER: May we have -

4            MR. UITERWYK: Bates 4.

5            MR. WALKER: Thank you.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   He concluded, Moreover, nicotine is

8   addictive. We are, then, in the business of selling

9   nicotine, an addictive drug effective in the release of

10   stress mechanisms.

11             And then before I read on, had they ever

12   publicly said that nicotine is addictive?

13       A.   In 1963, no. They didn't say publicly that

14   nicotine was addictive until -- these defendants --

15   until 2004.

16       Q.   And then they go on to say, But cigarettes,

17   we will assume the Surgeon General's committee to say,

18   despite the beneficent effects of nicotine, have

19   certain unattractive side effects: They cause or

20   predispose to lung cancer; they contribute to certain

21    cardiovascular disorders; and they may well be truly

22   causative in emphysema, etc.

23            We challenged those charges, and we have

24   assumed our obligation to determine their truth or

25   falsity by creating the new tobacco research 3349

1   foundation. In the meantime we say here is our triple

2   or quadruple or quintuple filter capable of removing

3   whatever constituent of smoke is currently suspect

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=419
4   while delivering full flavor, and incidentally, a nice

5   jolt of nicotine. And if we are the first to be able

6   to make and sustain that claim, what price Kent?

7            Did they -- is there such a filter?

8       A.   No. I mean, they came out with filter

9   claims, certainly, and promoted low tar and nicotine

10   delivery, much like Kent had done, but those products

11    were no safer.

12       Q.   And he goes on. Wait a minute.

13            What did he do, what did he tell them to do

14   with regard to the Battelle report?

15       A.   Well, this particular memo was written

16   July 17th, 1963, so -- and he, you know, essentially

17   did share it with his counterpart, the chief legal

18   counsel at R.J. Reynolds, in August, but he did not

19   share -- there was some discussion about whether to

20   turn this over to the Surgeon General's committee or

21    even members of the Scientific Advisory Board, who were

22   the so-called independent scientists who oversaw the

23   independent research funded by the Tobacco Industry

24   Research Committee. And so there was a cable that, you

25   know, Mr. Yeaman sent to his boss over at British 3350

1   American Tobacco where he discussed --

2       Q.   Let's go on and turn -- let's look at that

3   page, Exhibit 976. And is this the cable that you're

4   referring to?

5       A.   Correct.

6       Q.   And is the cable from Brown & Williamson?

7       A.   Correct.

8       Q.   From Mr. Yeaman?

9       A.   That's correct.

10       Q.   Prior to receipt of your Telex July 3rd, Hoyt

11    of TIRC agreed to withhold disclosure of the Battelle

12   report to TIRC members or SAB until further notice from

13   me. Finch agrees submission of Battelle or Griffith

14   developments to Surgeon General undesirable.

15            And did they, in fact, release the Battelle

16   information to the Surgeon General?

17       A.   No.

18       Q.   And was the Surgeon General report of 1964

19   issued without this information?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Without the conclusion of Mr. Yeaman that

22   nicotine is addictive?

23       A.   Correct.

24       Q.   In the meantime, while this was going on, did

25   they go out in public on TV shows and other programs 3351

1    and so forth and continue with their denial and

2   cover-up?

3       A.   Yes.

4            MR. UITERWYK: And if we could, please, we're

5       about to show the tape involving Howard Cullman,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=420
6       PT 1685. If we could get ready to show that.

7            MR. WALKER: Objection, as Williams, Your

8       Honor, one that Your Honor previously addressed.

9            THE COURT: All right. Overruled.

10   BY MR. UITERWYK:

11        Q.   And first of all, can you explain to the jury

12   who Howard Cullman is?

13       A.   Sure. Howard Cullman was on the board of

14   directors at Philip Morris. He was also the president

15   of the Tobacco Merchants Association. And essentially

16   he appears on television the day after the Surgeon

17   General's report was released in --

18       Q.   When was--sorry. You were about to say

19   that. Go ahead.

20       A.   January 11th, 1964, which was a Saturday. So

21    the Sunday talk shows had various spokespeople from

22   both sides who were on the shows, because it was a big

23   news story. And Mr. Cullman appeared representing the

24   Tobacco Merchants Association to answer questions of

25   Harry Reasoner, I believe. 3352

1            MR. UITERWYK: Play that, please.

2            (A video clip was played for the jury as

3       follows:)

4            A SPEAKER: This is a CBS News Extra on

5       smoking and health, the findings of the Surgeon

6       General's committee.

7            A SPEAKER: In our studio this afternoon,

8       following the Surgeon General's news conference,

9       CBS news correspond Richard C. Hottelet put some

10       questions to one of the leading spokesmen for the

11        industry, Howard Cullman, president of the Tobacco

12       Merchants Association and a long-time director of

13       the Philip Morris Company.

14            Mr. Cullman, prominent in the New York

15       theater and civic affairs, is a third-generation

16       member of the tobacco family.

17            R.C. HOTTELET: Mr. Cullman, the conclusions

18       are pretty stark and pretty solid. They say quite

19       flatly they express the judgment that cigarette

20       smoking contributes substantially to mortality

21        from certain specific diseases and to the overall

22       death rate than they have the rate that ten times

23       as high for smokers in the case of lung cancer,

24       and rather higher in other cases.

25            MR. CULLMAN: Well, that's awful hard to 3353

1        define, the word "substantial." I don't believe

2       that most people who smoke get lung cancer. We

3       are now in an era, as you know, of moderation. We

4       eat more carefully. We have cholesterol habits.

5       We have drinking habits of lighter whiskey. We

6       have smoking habits, which incidentally are today

7       changing the type of cigarettes from regular

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=421
8       cigarettes to filters.

9            Now, I was surprised at the beginning of the

10       conference when Dr. Terry is supposed to have said

11        that there is very little evidence, if any, on the

12       effect, if any, of filter cigarettes.

13            So when we have today 60 percent of the

14       business in the filter field compared to

15       three percent 10 years ago, I think we need a

16       little more research.

17            I'm convinced that eventually they will find

18       some element through a filter or through leaf

19       growing or a special type of seed growing that

20       will eliminate the mysterious thing they're

21        looking for. We want to be the detectives just as

22       much as the Surgeon General and the AMA, and we'll

23       cooperate in every way.

24            R.C. HOTTELET: Well, are you saying, then,

25       sir, that there is something toxic about tobacco 3354

1        which is removable by filter?

2            MR. CULLMAN: Well, obviously, a filter takes

3       out certain tar and nicotine. I don't think the

4       industry admits there are any bad elements. If

5       there are bad elements, through our laboratories,

6       through the Surgeon General, through the AMA,

7       through acts of God and luck, we hope we may find

8       them. And if they are found, they will be

9       removed. But at this point, we do not know.

10            R.C. HOTTELET: Now, does any of the research

11        that the tobacco industry has been engaged in

12       refute any part of the findings here or the

13       conclusions as a whole?

14            MR. CULLMAN: Well, without reading the

15       report, I couldn't answer that. To begin with, I

16       don't think that the tobacco industry as a whole

17       agrees with the conclusions.

18            (The video clip concluded.)

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   All right. And were there more things like

21    this done in the public as well?

22       A.   Sure.

23       Q.   Both particularly around the time that we

24   will be looking at in a little bit, around the times of

25   the Surgeon General reports? 3355

1        A.   The -- before the Surgeon General's report as

2   well as after the Surgeon General's report, there was a

3   massive public relations effort financed by the

4   companies jointly to basically refute evidence about

5   smoking and health.

6       Q.   And did they examine -- did they review how

7   their campaign of deception and denial was being -- how

8   it was doing?

9            MR. WALKER: Objection. Argumentative.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=422
10            THE COURT: Sustained.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   How was their PR campaign being done?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   And I want to take a look at PT 1817, if we

15   could.

16            It's confidential, stamped January 29th,

17    1964. Again, this is around the time of the Surgeon

18   General report?

19       A.   Correct. This is to Joseph Cullman, brother

20   of Howard Cullman. You saw Howard. But Joe Cullman

21    was the president of Philip Morris. He was also on the

22   executive committee for The Tobacco Institute, as well

23   as the -- as well TIRC. And George Weissman was, you

24   know, the director of marketing for Philip Morris; also

25   served on the TI communications committee. 3356

1            And they're talking about the Surgeon

2   General's report that had come out. You can see this

3   letter is -- or memo is dated January 29th, so just a

4   few weeks after the Surgeon General's report had come

5   out. And they're talking about how they had weathered

6   sort of the public relations storm around that and what

7   their plans needed to be moving forward.

8       Q.   What do they conclude?

9       A.   Well, they concluded that the restraint and

10   unity of the industry has been very effective in this

11   period, that the opponents have had their inning and

12   the-

13       Q.   And the opponents, based on your research, do

14   you know who the opponents are?

15            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. The

16       document speaks for itself. Meaning and intent

17       ruling.

18            THE COURT: Overruled.

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   Go ahead.

21        A.   They're talking about the Surgeon General,

22   public health officials.

23            The industry has demonstrated its seriousness

24   and responsibility in saying we would study the report.

25   However, at some point, reflecting the same seriousness 3357

1   with which we met the report, we must in the near

2   future provide some answers which will give smokers a

3   psychological crutch and a self-rationale to continue

4   smoking.

5       Q.   All right. Briefly, Doctor, as an expert on

6   addiction, to give a smoker a psychological crutch and

7   self-rationale to quit smoking, what is that from an

8   addictive standpoint? How does that affect the

9   addicted smoker?

10       A.   Giving somebody a rationale, an excuse to

11   keep smoking cigarettes. Telling addicted smokers that

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=423
12   it wasn't proven that smoking caused disease, that it

13   was merely a controversy, and if there were anything

14   bad in the product, they would remove it, and we have

15   filters and we have low tar. All of these were

16   calculated to give people an excuse to keep smoking.

17       Q.   The psychological crutch?

18       A.   That's right.

19       Q.   And was Jackie Loyd smoking during this time

20   period?

21        A.   Yes, she was.

22       Q.   And if you're taking this approach the

23   industry is taking, do they have to convince the smoker

24   that the industry is right and everything is fine with

25   smoking and the Surgeon General is wrong? 3358

1            MR. WALKER: Objection.

2            THE WITNESS: No.

3            MR. WALKER: Argumentative.

4            THE COURT: Overruled.

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   Go ahead.

7       A.   They have just to really create doubt about

8   the health charges that are being made about smoking

9   and health, so one has a doubt or a rationale or excuse

10   to hold on to. So they don't have to prove, because it

11    would be impossible to prove, that smoking wasn't

12   harmful, but they just needed to create enough doubt in

13   people's mind to give them an excuse to keep smoking.

14       Q.   And was there another visit during 1964 by

15   the --by the British American Tobacco Company?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   And did they evaluate what was going on and

18   what, in fact, role TIRC -- how TIRC was being run and

19   what effect, if any, the lawyers had in it?

20       A.   Yeah. They came over, again, to meet with

21    the heads of the companies as well as their affiliated

22   organizations, The Tobacco Institute and Tobacco

23   Industry Research Committee, which, by the way, in

24   March of 1964 was renamed to Council for Tobacco

25   Research. Same organization. 3359

1        Q.   So when we refer to TIRC, T-I-R-C, it's now

2   known as CTR, but the same organization?

3       A.   Right. They wanted to get rid of the word

4   "tobacco industry," so they made it Council for Tobacco

5   Research in the name.

6       Q.   And did they issue a report?

7       A.   They issued reports. They reissued a report

8   on their '64 visit of how things -- how the

9   organizations were responding to the growing evidence

10   about smoking and health.

11        Q.   And did they also issue a report and talk

12   about how, in fact, the involvement of the lawyers was

13   as it relates to TIRC, CTR and The Tobacco Institute?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=424
14       A.   Yes.

15            MR. WALKER: Objection. 403.

16            THE COURT: Overruled.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   Let's look at PT 3550, if we could, please,

19   Tab 129. And in particular, I want to look at Bates

20   stamp page 7, if we could.

21            Well, first of all, that report is dated

22   when?

23       A.   October of 1964. So, you know, about nine

24   months or so after the original report.

25       Q.   Okay. And let's look at PT --1 mean, Bates 3360

1   7 if we could, please.

2            And they're talking about influence of

3   lawyers. And they say in here, In consequence of the

4   importance of the lawsuits, the main power in the

5   smoking and health situation undoubtedly rests with the

6   lawyers and more particularly with the policy committee

7   of lawyers.

8            First of all -

9            MR. WALKER: Same objection, Your Honor.

10            THE COURT: Overruled.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   What is a policy committee of lawyers?

13       A.   Well, they had various names -- the law

14   committee, the committee on counsel. But they were the

15   essentially chief general counsel or their designee

16   from each of the companies that oversaw the activities

17   of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and then The

18   Tobacco Institute, sort of establishing what the

19   companies would say on the issue of smoking and health,

20   so they would speak with a unified voice rather than

21    each company offering their own comments.

22       Q.   Were they also involved in which research

23   projects, how they would be handled, how the research

24   projects would be handled?

25       A.   Sure. The committee --3361

1            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. May I

2       have a continuing objection on this line of

3       inquiry?

4            THE COURT: On 403?

5            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

6            THE COURT: Yes, you may.

7            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Judge.

8            THE COURT: Overruled.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Go ahead.

11        A.   This committee also helped select research

12   projects under the category of special projects that

13   was funded by TIRC, CTR. So these were projects that

14   didn't go through peer review; they weren't reviewed by

15   scientists based on scientific merit. They were

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=425
16   selected on other criteria that were important to the

17   companies, and so they had the public SAB, Scientific

18   Advisory Board research that was funded, most of which

19   had little to do with smoking and health. And then

20   they had the lawyer selected projects that they funded,

21    which were primarily the defensive nature, to help them

22   create a controversy around smoking and health. That

23   was the special projects.

24       Q.   And were representatives of this committee

25   people from Reynolds and Lorillard as well? 3362

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   And in that report, did they conclude, The

3   committee is extremely powerful and determines the high

4   policy of the industry on all smoking and health

5   matters, research and public relations matters, for

6   example, as well as legal matters, and it reports

7   directly to the presidents?

8       A.   Right. The presidents were the executive

9   committee.

10       Q.   All right. In addition to controlling what

11    was published or not published, what was disclosed and

12   what was not disclosed, did they still -- were they

13   still doing -- creating doubt, controversy, the

14   cigarette controversy that we were talking about

15   before?

16            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading and

17       argumentative.

18            THE COURT: Overruled.

19   BY MR. UITERWYK:

20       Q.   Go ahead.

21        A.   Yes. I mean, that was the goal of their --

22   the research that they did under special projects, was

23   to try to fund research to cast doubt on the smoking

24   and health charge. These were either methodologic

25   studies that were challenging some of the studies that 3363

1   had come out on methodologic bases, as well as funding

2   research into alternative causation, what they referred

3   to as the constitutional hypothesis or the

4   multifactorial hypothesis, anything but cigarettes

5   essentially that would account for why cigarette

6   smoking had been found in all these studies that were

7   then beginning to appear in the literature and Surgeon

8   General's reports implicating smoking as a cause of

9   disease.

10       Q.   All right. If we could look at 3196, if we

11    could, please.

12            We've seen the Tiderock before, have we not?

13   No?

14       A.   I don't think so.

15       Q.   Okay. The Tiderock Corporation, who retained

16   the Tiderock Corporation? What was it and what's this

17   program about?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=426
18       A.   Sure. Tiderock was a marketing company that

19   was hired by The Tobacco Institute, and they were hired

20   in 1967. This is a cover page of a proposal to The

21    Tobacco Institute that was, in fact, funded and

22   executed after this proposal was made to The Tobacco

23   Institute. This is in 1967.

24            And they're talking about the cigarette

25   controversy and action program, the need to reestablish 3364

1   for the companies the cigarette controversy and a

2   public relations campaign to get that message out to

3   the general public, to editorial leaders so that, you

4   know, that the word that there was a controversy would

5   appear.

6       Q.   Was this part of the psychological crutch?

7            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

8            THE COURT: Sustained.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   How did this relate to the psychological

11    crutch that we discussed earlier?

12       A.   Sure. This is the public relations program

13   that they had talked about needing to give to smokers.

14   This is the actual operational description of the

15   program that was planned and then subsequently

16   implemented and beginning in 1968 really going forward

17   to the time that these organizations went out of

18   business.

19       Q.   And let's look at, if we could, Bates stamp

20   2, please.

21             And did they at that time -- that is actually

22   strategy, is it not, under the section Strategy?

23       A.   Yeah. They were talking about their

24   objective and they said the program needs to

25   reestablish the cigarette controversy and the program 3365

1   must be massive, because they estimated that the

2   clearinghouse, which was the organization set up by the

3   federal government to issue Surgeon General's reports,

4   was getting a lot of coverage because, when these

5   reports came out, the media would pick them up. And

6   they estimated in media terms -- this is not paid

7   media, because the clearinghouse didn't pay for media,

8   but they got earned media valued at about 50 million a

9   year. So they were talking about a program that would

10   help counter that.

11        Q.   And did they, in fact, continue to discuss

12   the program?

13       A.   They did.

14       Q.   And did they have a -- five-program targets?

15   We'll go over this quickly on page 3. And briefly, so

16   we don't have to go through this entire document, what

17   do they recommend to be part of that program?

18       A.   Well-

19            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. The

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=427
20       document speaks for itself.

21             THE COURT: Sustained.

22            THE WITNESS: The action program -

23            THE COURT: Sustained.

24            THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry.

25            MR. UITERWYK: Hold on. 3366

1            THE COURT: That's okay.

2   BY MR. UITERWYK:

3       Q.   Did they have, part of the program for the

4   general public, molders of public opinion, lawmakers,

5   tobacco industry groups and things of that nature?

6       A.   Yeah. These were the target audiences for

7   the reestablished controversy.

8       Q.   And did R.J. Reynolds and Lorillard and the

9   other cigarette companies through TI, The

10   Tobacco Institute, contract and, in fact, establish and

11    create the massive campaign to establish, and continue

12   to establish the cigarette controversy?

13       A.   Well, at various times -- R.J. Reynolds

14   certainly did throughout the entire period. To be

15   fair, Lorillard came in and out of The

16   Tobacco Institute at different periods in time.

17       Q.   And did the -- did they continue to issue the

18   white paper that we discussed, I believe, last Friday?

19       A.   They did.

20       Q.   What else did they do with regard to that

21   program?

22       A.   Well, they had articles ghost-written that

23   appeared in popular magazines, again, to reassure

24   smokers that it was okay to smoke. They put out the

25   Tobacco and Health Research Newsletter, which was a 3367

1    summary of articles essentially challenging the link

2   between smoking and health and, you know, sent that out

3   widely to medical doctors, hospitals. The white papers

4   were reissued beginning in 1968, called The Cigarette

5   Controversy. They helped them produce films. They

6   trained spokespeople. They created a public relations

7   campaign called Project Truth that was aired as a

8   public service ad in the early seventies, so there was

9   a variety of things that they did.

10       Q.   Did they ever disclose what we saw in those

11    documents earlier today and later on Friday in these

12   publications that you are referring to?

13       A.   No. The publications, which were written

14   very much in laymen's language, essentially said that

15   cigarette smoking hadn't been proved to be the cause of

16   any harm to human health and it was all based on

17   statistics, and so they did not highlight the

18   conclusions of Dr. Rodgman or Dr. Wakeham or any of the

19   other things that we've seen so far.

20       Q.   All right. Let's look at Exhibit No. 1941.

21   We've seen the company Hill & Knowlton. They were

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=428
22   actually the PR firm that was retained at the Plaza

23   Hotel meeting?

24            MR. WALKER: Objection under Williams, Your

25       Honor, as previously addressed. 3368

1            THE COURT: Overruled.

2            THE WITNESS: Yes.

3   BY MR. UITERWYK:

4       Q.   And what is this document? This document is

5   dated 1968, and tell the jury what this document is

6   about.

7       A.   Here they're talking about the tobacco and

8   health research newsletters that were written and

9   distributed to the doctors and medical groups. And

10   they were talking about the criteria for selection,

11   because these were just really taking excerpts of

12   research findings and then reprinting them in this

13   little newsletter.

14            And they were talking about the criteria for

15   the selection of studies that they would highlight in

16   the tobacco and health research that The

17   Tobacco Institute widely distributed to doctors and

18   hospitals around the country.

19       Q.   And did they discuss in this particular

20   memorandum on page 2 what type of documents, the story

21    that they wanted to get out?

22       A.   Yeah. They said the most important type of

23   story is that which casts doubt on the cause-and-effect

24   theory of disease and smoking, and that, you know,

25   thus, the headline should strongly call out the points, 3369

1    controversy, contraindication, other factors unknown.

2   And that's exactly what they did.

3       Q.   And did these stories get out?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   That cast doubt?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   And let's look at another document, if we

8   could, in that regard, 2130, where they talk about the

9   cigarette controversy, and that's what they were

10   talking about in setting up this program to create the

11    cigarette controversy.

12       A.   Right. I mean, the prior document was

13   Carl Thompson, an executive of Hill & Knowlton, writing

14   to William Kloepfer, who was the vice president in

15   charge of public relations for The Tobacco Institute.

16   This particular document is written by William Kloepfer

17   to Earle Clements. Earle Clements was the president --

18   he was a former senator, but he was the president of

19   The Tobacco Institute at the time that this was --

20       Q.   The Tobacco Institute, all the defendants in

21    this case and all the cigarette companies were members

22   of that?

23            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=429
24            THE COURT: Sustained.

25   BY MR. UITERWYK: 3370

1        Q.   Who was in The Tobacco Institute?

2       A.   Well, the founders of The Tobacco Institute

3   were all the major cigarette manufacturers, including

4   Reynolds and Lorillard. I think in 1968,1 believe,

5   Lorillard had dropped out for a period of time, and

6   were not members at this time.

7       Q.   Okay. And so anyway, now we're talking about

8   The Tobacco Institute. And this is from Kloepfer and

9   addressed to Clements. What do they say about their --

10   about regarding what their position was as it relates

11    to the cigarette controversy?

12       A.   Our basic position in the cigarette

13   controversy is subject to the charge and may be subject

14   to a finding that we are making false and misleading

15   statements to promote the sale of cigarettes.

16       Q.   Did they even at some point refer to, as

17   doubt being their product?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   And did they refer to it, the doubt which

20   they wanted to create, as being a product?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   And did they continue to market that product

23   of doubt?

24       A.   They engineered their public relations

25   campaign specifically to create doubt in the public's 3371

1   mind about the relationship between smoking and health.

2       Q.   All right. And I believe we've talked about

3   how doubt is important as a psychological -- or the

4   rationalization for the cigarette -- the addicted

5   smoker. And I'm not going to go into that again.

6            Can we -- can we have some examples -- you

7   suggested we show some examples of creating doubt,

8   videos that they have done and publications -- not

9   publications, but public appearances that they did in

10   that regard?

11        A.   Sure. There are many videos that came to me

12   as part of The Tobacco Institute archive that was

13   turned over, where they have their spokespeople

14   speaking on various television and radio shows,

15   including shows like "Face The Nation," where

16   Joe Cullman, who was president of Philip Morris but

17   also the chairman of the Tobacco Industry Research

18   Committee, represented all the members of the TI at

19   that time and was asked a variety of questions about

20   smoking and health.

21             The relevance of the 1971 appearance on "Face

22   The Nation" was because cigarette advertising had just

23   been removed from television and radio at that time.

24   And so he appeared on that show and he was asked a

25   variety of questions and he gave essentially the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=430
3372

1    standard line that you heard from the companies, you

2   know, over decades.

3       Q.   And this was --1 mean, we saw previous clips

4   where they showed -- like, for instance, where we

5   had --1 can't remember the guy's name. Weissman. No.

6   The other Cullman, Howard Cullman?

7       A.   Howard Cullman, right.

8       Q.   Went on and talked about the issues like

9   that. And there are more like that, are there not?

10       A.   Many more.

11        Q.   Okay.

12       A.   Thousands.

13       Q.   All right. We're just seeing a

14   representative example?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   All right. Let's look at that, please.

17            MR. WALKER: Renew my objection under 90.403

18       and the other rulings of this circuit.

19            THE COURT: Same ruling.

20            (A video clip was played for the jury as

21        follows:)

22            From CBS Washington in color, "Face The

23       Nation," a spontaneous and unrehearsed news

24       interview with Joseph Cullman, III, chairman and

25       chief executive officer of Philip Morris, 3373

1        Incorporated, and chairman of the executive

2       committee of The Tobacco Institute.

3            MR. CULLMAN: We have no program that I know

4       of to try to help people to stop smoking. We do

5       talk to the question of whether or not cigarettes

6       are hazardous. We do not believe that cigarettes

7       are hazardous. We don't accept that. And this

8       industry can face the future with confidence

9       because, when, as, and if any ingredient in

10       cigarette smoke is identified as being injurious

11        to human health, we are confident that we can

12       eliminate that ingredient.

13            I will say that I did read that report. And

14       I concluded from that report that it's true, that

15       babies born from women who smoke are smaller, but

16       they're just as healthy as the babies born from

17       women who do not smoke.

18            A SPEAKER: What about the higher rate of

19       death?

20            MR. CULLMAN: And some women would prefer

21        having smaller babies.

22            A SPEAKER: How about the higher rate of

23       death?

24            MR. CULLMAN: I don't --1 don't -- I'm not

25       familiar with that. 3374

2   BY MR. UITERWYK:

3       Q.   He mentioned here -- how much airplay did a

4   program like this get, Face The Nation, during this

5   time frame? This was in 1971?

6       A.   Sure.

7       Q.   I mean, they were still denying that there

8   was an association between cigarette smoking and

9   health?

10            MR. WALKER: Objection. Leading.

11             THE COURT: Sustained.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   Did they -- did this -- did they change their

14   refrain at all from the fifties to the 71 time frame

15   as far as cigarettes and smoking and health?

16       A.   Not really, no.

17       Q.   All right. And there was mention, I

18   believe -- strike that.

19            They also said -- apparently there was a

20   question with regard to whether cigarette companies did

21    anything to make cigarettes less addictive, and we

22   don't -- and I believe they said we don't have any

23   program to help people stop smoking. Is that what he

24   said?

25       A.   Yes. 3375

1        Q.   Up until the nineties, late nineties, did

2   they ever have any type of program to inform, educate,

3   help or suggest to people how -- what they needed to do

4   to stop smoking?

5       A.   No. The earliest programs I'm aware of,

6   Philip Morris had a program for young people, for

7   parents, in 2003. That was the earliest I'm aware of.

8       Q.   Okay. Did the cigarette companies ever do

9   anything, the cigarette industry, particularly the

10   defendants, anything to make the cigarettes less

11    addictive in this time frame?

12       A.   No. Just the opposite. The things that they

13   did to their products probably made them more

14   addictive, because they made them easier to inhale.

15   That's why the relative risk or diseases went up, not

16   down.

17       Q.   And did they also -- have you also brought

18   records that reflect that they reviewed their program

19   from a historical perspective, looked back to see how

20   it was doing?

21        A.   Sure. They were always reassessing the

22   success of their strategy to see what was working and

23   then planning based on that moving forward, so that was

24   done frequently.

25       Q.   And, you know, I think we mentioned it, but 3376

1   you said it was -- how many documents have you reviewed

2   in connection with developing your expertise in the

3   area of the cover-up?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=432
4       A.   Oh, many thousands --

5       Q.   Okay.

6       A.   -- of documents I have reviewed, cited,

7   written about. I developed the index that allowed

8   searching across different categories. So I have

9   focused on different categories of documents.

10       Q.   Are you familiar with a document called --

11    regarding the Roper Proposal?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   2050, please, Baron.

14            And this is dated May 1st, 1972?

15       A.   Correct. This is a Tobacco Institute

16   document from Fred Panzer, who was the vice president

17   at The Tobacco Institute, to Horace Kornegay, a former

18   congressman, now the president of The

19   Tobacco Institute. So he came after Earle Clements.

20   And so in 1972, Horace Kornegay is the president of The

21    Tobacco Institute.

22       Q.   Okay. And this is 20 -- almost 20 years from

23   the date of the meeting at the Plaza Hotel?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   All right. And what is this document about? 3377

1        A.   Well, basically, they're doing a

2   retrospective look back on the strategy that had been

3   employed by the manufacturers through the creation of

4   the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and then

5   spinning off the Communications Committee, which became

6   The Tobacco Institute in 1958, and talking about that

7   for nearly 20 years this industry has employed a single

8   strategy to defend itself on three major fronts:

9   Litigation, politics and public opinion. And while the

10   strategy was brilliantly conceived and executed over

11    the years, helping us win important battles, it is only

12   fair to say that it is not, nor was it intended to be,

13   a vehicle for victory. On the contrary, it has always

14   been a holding strategy, consisting of creating doubt

15   about the health charge without actually denying it.

16   Advocating the right to smoke, and encouraging

17   objective scientific research is the only way to answer

18   the question, essentially.

19       Q.   And what else did they say with regard to

20   their strategy as it relates -- Baron.

21        A.   It said, In the cigarette controversy, the

22   public, especially those who are present and potential

23   supporters, such as tobacco state congressmen and heavy

24   smokers, must perceive, understand, and believe in

25   evidence to sustain their opinions that smoking may not 3378

1   be the causal factor. As things stand, we supply them

2   with too little in the way of ready-made credible

3   alternatives. And the alternatives, they talk about

4   the two credible ones are the constitutional

5   hypothesis, which essentially says that people who

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=433
6   smoke tend to differ importantly from people who do not

7   in their hereditary and constitutional makeup and their

8   patterns of life and pressures under which they live;

9   and then the multifactorial hypothesis, you know, as

10   science advances, more and more factors come under

11    suspicion as contributing to illness for which smoking

12   is blamed, such as air pollution, viruses.

13       Q.   And did they also actually discuss in here

14   how the success of their strategy was in affecting

15   public opinion, particularly that of their customers

16   and particularly their heavy smokers?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   Can you --

19       A.   Sure. They talk about a public opinion poll

20   that had been done in 1970 that showed that the

21    majority believe that cigarettes are only one of many

22   causes of smokers having more illness. It also shows

23   that half of the people who believe that smokers have

24   more illnesses than nonsmokers accept the

25   constitutional hypothesis as the explanation. Thus, 3379

1   there are millions of people who would be receptive to

2   a new message stating cigarette smoking may not be the

3   health hazard that the anti-smoking people say it is

4   because other alternatives are at least as probable.

5       Q.   So, was this an analysis of their -- of their

6   program?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Did their program work?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   How well?

11        A.   Well, it certainly delayed people becoming

12   aware of the health risks of smoking, so it gave

13   smokers an excuse to keep smoking. And I think what --

14   the analysis that I have seen in terms of the number of

15   deaths from smoking, had cigarettes disappeared --

16            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

17       Nonresponsive.

18            MR. UITERWYK: I asked him --

19            THE COURT: Sustained. Ask another question,

20       please.

21    BY MR. UITERWYK:

22       Q.   All right. What effect did this program have

23   on what was going on with smokers?

24       A.   It worked. Smokers consistently in the polls

25   that I have done, as well as others have done that I 3380

1   have studied, during this period and going forward,

2   show that smokers consistently, compared to nonsmokers

3   or former smokers, believe that cigarettes have not

4   been proven to be harmful, you know, sort of challenged

5   whether cigarettes were addictive. In other words, you

6   know, those beliefs did change over time but smokers

7   were always about 20 percent behind the nonsmokers and

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=434
8   the former smokers.

9            So it suggests, and their own evidence says

10   that it was working by creating doubt, particularly

11    among their target audience of heavy smokers.

12       Q.   All right. And in following this program of

13   denial and creating doubt and covering up, did they do

14   a number of appearances during a ten-year -- over a

15   ten-year time frame on the media?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   And do we have a clip which kind of puts them

18   all together?

19       A.   Right. I mean, as I mentioned, I had had,

20   you know, literally thousands of these video and audio

21    clips. This is from spokespeople from The Tobacco

22   Institute, I believe, and also Ed Horrigan from

23   R.J. Reynolds, all public appearances between 1975 and

24    1985.

25            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I object. This is 3381

1       plaintiffs 4007?

2            MR. UITERWYK: It is.

3            MR. WALKER: My objection is under Williams

4       that Your Honor has addressed previously.

5            THE COURT: Okay. Did I previously rule on

6       it, Mr. Walker?

7            MR. UITERWYK: You did, Your Honor.

8            MR. WALKER: Only in the context of your

9       broader Williams ruling.

10            THE COURT: Okay. Objection is overruled.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   What are we going to see here?

13       A.   So these are -- it's just a compilation, very

14   quickly, of statements from these representatives who

15   were the paid public professionals from The

16   Tobacco Institute. They referred to themselves as The

17   Truth Squad. That was their term. And so ten years of

18   what they told the American public.

19            MR. UITERWYK: Please, Baron.

20            (A video clip was played for the jury as

21        follows:)

22            A SPEAKER: Cigarette smoking may be

23       hazardous to your health; it may not be. We just

24       don't know.

25            A SPEAKER: I don't know. Frankly, I think 3382

1        that smoking may be hazardous; it may not be.

2            A SPEAKER: Smoking may be hazardous; it may

3       not be. No one, including TV 7, knows for

4       certain.

5            A SPEAKER: It may be, or it may not be. We

6       don't know.

7            A SPEAKER: I don't know if cigarettes are

8       bad or they're not bad.

9            A SPEAKER: We don't know what causes the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=435
10       illness that have been attributed to cigarette

11        smoking.

12            A SPEAKER: I am saying that the science to

13       date and over $100,000,000 of our industry

14       indicates that there is no causal link.

15            A SPEAKER: I am not denying the fact that

16       cigarette smoking could be a risk factor involved

17       with some people.

18            A SPEAKER: You know, what we know is that

19       the rabbit runs through the briar patch. It's

20       pretty hard for him to look back and see which

21       briar stuck him.

22            (The video clip concluded.)

23   BY MR. UITERWYK:

24       Q.   Who was that right there?

25       A.   That's Horace Kornegay, president of The 3383

1   Tobacco Institute.

2       Q.   Who was the gentleman who apparently was in

3   front of a microphone, appeared to be --

4       A.   That was R.J. Reynolds' Ed Horrigan, former

5   CEO. He appeared with Mr. Kornegay in 1982 in a

6   congressional hearing.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, it may be a good

8       time to break here if you wish.

9            THE COURT: All right. It's about mid

10       morning. We'll take a 15-minute break. Bear in

11        mind my instructions to keep an open mind and

12       not -- and to not discuss this case. We'll be in

13       recess for 15 minutes.

14            (The jury retired from the courtroom at

15        10:20 a.m.)

16            THE COURT: All right. We'll be in recess.

17            (A recess was taken at 10:20 a.m.)

18            (Court called to order at 10:42 a.m.)

19            THE COURT: All right. Are we ready?

20            MR. UITERWYK: I am, Your Honor.

21             (The jury returned to the courtroom at

22        10:44 a.m.)

23            THE COURT: Thank you, be seated.

24            MR. UITERWYK: May it please the Court --

25            THE COURT: Yes, sir. 3384

1            MR. UITERWYK: --Counsel?

2   BY MR. UITERWYK:

3       Q.   Let's move to -- a little bit to January

4    10th, 1979. Can you tell the jury why that date is

5   important?

6       A.   Sure. The January 10th was the date that the

7   Tobacco Institute held a press event at the Mayflower

8   Hotel in Washington, D.C., to launch their 15-year

9   cigarette controversy document and comment on the

10   Surgeon General's report, the 15th anniversary report,

11    which was scheduled to come out the very next day. So

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=436
12   they did a preemptive press event on January 10th. As

13   was often the case, they would often put out press

14   releases on the 10th, because the U.S. government would

15   issue their Surgeon General's report. They tried to do

16   it on the anniversary date of the report, which was

17   January 11.

18       Q.   And we're going to be showing a clip.

19   What's -- what is he going to be talking about?

20       A.   Well, Bill Dwyer was, again, one of the paid

21   public relations people who worked for The Tobacco

22   Institute, and he ran the press event. And he is

23   talking about Mr. Califano, who was the then secretary

24   of Health, Education and Welfare, now known as Health

25   and Human Services. So he was a cabinet member in 3385

1   Jimmy Carter's presidency, and he was -- he had written

2   the forward, and Mr. Dwyer has some comments about him.

3       Q.   When you say he had written the forward, he

4   had written the forward in the 1978 

5       A.   '79.

6       Q.   '79, rather. Thank you. --the'79

7   Surgeon General's report?

8       A.   Yes. Because the report at that time came

9   out from the Department of Health, Education, and

10   Welfare.

11             MR. WALKER: Can we have the exhibit number?

12            MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry, PT4007-8.

13            (A video clip was played for the jury as

14       follows:

15            It was suspect from the start. HEW Secretary

16       Calif ano launched his anti-smoking campaign with

17       all the zeal of a reformed sinner. And now in an

18       apparent attempt to bring some science to the side

19       of his evangelism, the former three-pack-a-day

20       secretary told the Surgeon General, Prepare a new

21        report. Its issuance, an internal HEW memo

22       said -- and I quote -- would be a media event,

23       closed quote. Turning a significant health

24       question into a publicity stunt is an insult to

25       serious science. America, beware if Joe Calif ano 3386

1        ever gives up drinking or other pleasure pursuits,

2       even the most intimate.

3            (The video clip concluded.)

4   BY MR. UITERWYK:

5       Q.   And when did that report come out? What was

6   it about, that report?

7       A.   Well, the '79 Surgeon General's report was a

8    15-year summary of the evidence on smoking and health,

9   you know, really, over that 15-year period. So it was

10   a massive report. It was close to 900 pages long, and

11    it covered just about every topic you could ask about

12   in smoking and health, so it was a pretty significant

13   report at the time.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=437
14       Q.   Now, in addition to attacking HEW, did they

15   actually attack the reports as well -- as well as the

16   Surgeon General and the scientists involved in these

17   reports?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   On an ongoing basis, both in the past as well

20   as in the future, from that period on?

21        A.   Sure. I mean, it was -- you will find press

22   releases that were issued on a routine basis attacking

23   the Surgeon General's reports, often in a preemptive

24   way, you know, basically claiming that they -- the No.

25    1 health problem wasn't smoking, that it was the 3387

1    Surgeon General.

2       Q.   And did they also work behind the scenes as

3   well, internally, in order to see that certain things

4   were covered up or that not the entire truth was

5   disclosed?

6            MR. WALKER: Objection: leading;

7       argumentative.

8            THE COURT: Sustained.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   What do they do behind the scenes as it

11    relates to some of the matters that were coming out

12   that they wanted to make sure didn't come out?

13       A.   Essentially, the companies controlled the

14   information that would come out so that they were

15   speaking with a unified voice regarding the issues

16   related to smoking and health. So they would

17   communicate that it wasn't proven; it was a

18   controversy; if anything was found to be harmful, they

19   would remove it but nothing had. So that was,

20   essentially, the mantra over close to 50 years.

21        Q.   And did the law -- the lawyers get very much

22   involved, as we discussed earlier in this area?

23            MR. WALKER: Objection. 402,403.

24            THE COURT: Overruled.

25            THE WITNESS: The lawyers oversaw the 3388

1        communications from TI and CTR and also within

2       their own companies of what their spokes you

3       know, what their scientists would be able to

4       communicate in any kind of form. And they very

5       carefully regulated what their scientists would be

6       able to say and where they would be able to say

7       it.

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   And let's look at Exhibit No. 1913, please,

10   tab 139.

11             First of all, who is this document from? Who

12   is it to? And what's it regarding? And this is dated

13   December 13th, 1983, correct?

16   the head of the legal department at Reynolds, at the

17   time, Mr. Witt. And they are talking about a new

18   employee who had been hired as one of their

19   vice-presidents for R&D at the time, Gerald DiMarco.

20       Q.   Let's see what they say during -- and he is

21    talking about "during his." Is he talking about

22   Mr. DiMarco?

23       A.   Yes. The law department had interviewed

24   Mr. DiMarco --or Dr. DiMarco, when he had come into

25   the company, and they had asked him a variety of 3389

1   questions, and they are summarizing their interview.

2       Q.   During his law department orientation, he,

3   Mr. DiMarco, said that he thinks it is essential for

4   R&D to work on a development of a less mutagenic

5   cigarette. What is a less mutagenic cigarette?

6       A.   Well, every puff of a cigarette does your

7   body damage, does DNA damage. And they are really

8   talking about the, you know, cellular damage when they

9   are talking about mutagenic genetic damage to the cells

10   from cigarette smoke.

11        Q.   He believes that this is a prudent,

12   responsible thing to do but has been told by the

13   lawyers, Ed Jacobs, that he can't do this work.

14            And then the writer of this, Mr. -- how do

15   you say that?

16       A.   Juchatz.

17       Q.   -- Juchatz says, I explained our legal

18   concerns about the admission implicit in the words

19    "less mutagenic" or "safer," that our existing products

20   are "mutagenic" or "unsafe." He seemed to understand

21    our concern but refused to accept it as a rationale for

22   not doing what he felt we had an obligation to do as a

23   responsible manufacturer.

24            Did I read that correctly?

25       A.   You did. 3390

1        Q.   And then also -- he also said, Although I

2   can't recall his exact words, that our

3   medical/scientific witnesses will say whatever we want

4   them to say, clearly implying, if not stating that they

5   lacked credibility and integrity.

6            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I renew the motion

7       that I made during openings.

8            THE COURT: All right. Overruled.

9   BY MR. UITERWYK:

10       Q.   Now, do we have another clip done in 1983

11    with regard to Ann Browder, 30 years actually after the

12   mouse study?

13       A.   Correct.

14       Q.   And this is decades after the internal

15   documents or the reports regarding carcinogens and

16   cancer agents in cigarettes?

17            MR. WALKER: Objection: leading;

18       argumentative.

19            THE COURT: Sustained.

20   BY MR. UITERWYK:

21        Q.   How long is this particular program after we

22   saw -- after Teague, Rodgman, Hoover, Senkus, and these

23   type of doctors?

24       A.   It's about 25 to 30 years.

25       Q.   All right. And let's -- and who is Ann 3391

1   Browder?

2       A.   Ann Browder was one of the spokespeople for

3   The Tobacco Institute. We saw her in some of the clips

4   previously. And she appeared on the show 20/20 in

5   October of 1983 to answer questions asked by John

6   Stossel. Actually, other representatives for the

7   companies were asked to send their representatives, and

8   they nominated Ann Browder to speak on behalf of them

9   on the show.

10            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Play the clip,

11       please. And this is 168 -- oh, sorry. It's 1913.

12       All right. Yes.  1913.

13            MR. PHILIPSON: This is 1680, Mr. Uiterwyk.

14            MR. UITERWYK: What?

15            MR. PHILIPSON:  1683.

16            MR. UITERWYK: Oh, I'm sorry.  1683.

17            (A video clip was played for the jury as

18       follows:)

19            We asked Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown

20       & Williamson, and Lorillard to appear on this

21       program. None would. They told us to talk to The

22       Tobacco Institute. The institute said Ann Browder

23       would speak for them.

24            MS. BROWDER: The case is still open. The

25       jury has not come in. 3392

1            MR. STOSSEL: It may not be harmful. You're

2       not convinced?

3            MS. BROWDER: It may be, or it may not be.

4       We don't know.

5            (The video clip concluded.)

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Did this continue?

8       A.   Yes.

9       Q.   In addition to doing TV, did they also place

10   advertising in the newspapers?

11        A.   Yes, they did.

12       Q.   And, particularly, did R.J. Reynolds do some

13   advertisements in the newspapers as it relates to

14   creating doubt, controversy, and those things that we

15   have been discussing?

16       A.   Yes. In 1984, that was the last of the white

17   papers published by The Tobacco Institute, so they

18   published one every year since they started in '54, and

19   they did '68 to '84. They had one that came out every

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=440
20   year. They discontinued it in '84. And R.J. Reynolds

21    launched its own campaign called the Open Debate

22   Campaign, which ran for two years. It had print ads.

23   It had pamphlets that they would send out to consumers

24   who would write into the company or media who would

25   want information about the company's position on 3393

1    smoking and health. They also had their spokespeople

2   go out and make appearances on behalf of this, what

3   they referred to as the Open Debate Campaign. So I've

4   brought along examples of the print ad and a clip of

5   their president of the company speaking about the

6   campaign, the Open Debate Campaign.

7       Q.   How long did this campaign last?

8       A.   Basically -- well, I mean, essentially it

9   went on until the -- until the end of the 1990s. But

10   this particular Open Debate Campaign, which was a, you

11   know, paid-for public relations effort, went for about

12   two years.

13       Q.   And this is PT467?

14            MR. WALKER: Same objection under Williams,

15       Your Honor. It's already been addressed.

16            THE COURT: Overruled.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   And did this appear --

19            THE COURT: Overruled.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Sorry.

21    BY MR. UITERWYK:

22       Q.   Did this appear in various newspapers?

23       A.   It did, newspapers, magazines, like Time and

24   Newsweek ran it. This is New York Times, USA Today. I

25   mean, it was -- it appeared in major publications 3394

1    around the country.

2       Q.   And was this an ad that's paid for by

3   Reynolds?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   And, Doctor, the information -- and I'm going

6   to go through in a minute -- but the information that's

7   in these type of things, is this the type of thing that

8   we've talked about, creating the psychological crutch,

9   creating the doubt in order to cause people to continue

10   to smoke?

11             MR. WALKER: Objection: leading;

12       argumentative.

13            THE COURT: Sustained.

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   What effects do these types of articles have

16   on the addicted smoker?

17       A.   Oh, they give --

18       Q.   More ads?

19       A.   Yeah. I mean, they are intended by design to

20   give consumers, anybody reading the ad, the impression

21    that there was a controversy about whether smoking

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=441
22   caused disease. And so it would give people an excuse

23   and a rationale to keep smoking if they were and if

24   they hadn't started to smoke, to start up, because

25   there was no need to worry. 3395

1        Q.   And do they frequently, in these types of

2   articles and ads and white papers, use the word "open

3   controversy," "debate," "we don't know," "other side of

4   the story," and these type of words --

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   -- to create that doubt?

7            MR. UITERWYK: All right. Baron, if we could

8       look above, the paragraph right above this one,

9       We, at Reynolds. Down, down, studies.

10       Starting -- studies, right there.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.   And studies which conclude that smoking

13   causes disease have regularly ignored significant

14   evidence to the contrary. These scientific findings

15   come from research completely independent of the

16   tobacco industry.

17            First of all, were those scientific findings

18   completely independent from the tobacco industry?

19       A.   Well, many of the scientific findings that

20   they cited in their white papers and in their reports,

21    in fact, came from the special projects and indicates

22   that those investigators who published their papers, in

23   fact, had received funding from the tobacco companies

24   or gave testimony -- now, whether they believed it or

25   not, they may have. But there was money that was 3396

1   transferred for that special project work, so they

2   weren't completely independent, in my view.

3       Q.   We at R.J. Reynolds think you will find such

4   evidence very interesting. We think reasonable people

5   who analyze it may come to see this issue, not as a

6   closed case, but as an open controversy.

7            Going on to the last paragraph of this ad:

8   Like any controversy, this one has more than one side.

9   We hope the debate will be an open one.

10            And then does he also go on TV and talk about

11    this?

12       A.   Yes. Ed Horrigan, who was then the CEO of

13   R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, did appear on the show

14   Nightline with Ted Koppel in 1984 when this was

15   launched. And, you know, he was asked about this new

16   public relations campaign. The timing is relevant

17   because this is the period of time that C. Everett Koop

18   was the Surgeon General of the United States and had

19   put out his reports on smoking and health. So this is,

20   essentially, a countereffort against that.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Let's see 1751, please.

22            MR. WALKER: And, Your Honor, just for the

23       record, our objections to these are addressed by

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=442
24       Your Honor's Williams ruling.

25            THE COURT: Thank you. Same ruling. 3397

1            What tab are we on, sir?

2            MR. UITERWYK: We're on tab 143, Your Honor.

3            THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

4            MR. UITERWYK: This is actually a video, Your

5       Honor.

6            THE COURT: Right, I understand.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Actually 142.

8            (A video clip was played for the jury as

9       follows:)

10            A SPEAKER: Earlier this week the R.J.

11        Reynolds Tobacco Company took out this ad in a

12       number of major newspapers and magazines, calling

13       for an open debate about smoking. In brief, the

14       ad contends that medical studies which show that

15       cigarette smoking causes disease are ignoring

16       significant evidence to the contrary.

17            MR. KOPPEL: Cigarette smoking does not cause

18       cancer, yes or no?

19            MR. HORRIGAN: It is not known whether

20       cigarettes cause cancer.

21             MR. KOPPEL: All right, sir.

22            MR. HORRIGAN: It has not been causally

23       established.

24            MR. KOPPEL: Cigarette smoking, no causal

25       relationship between cigarette smoking and 3398

1        emphysema?

2            MR. HORRIGAN: Despite all the research to

3       date, there has been no causal link established.

4            MR. KOPPEL: No causal relationship between

5       cigarette smoking and heart disease?

6            MR. HORRIGAN: No. As a matter of fact,

7       there are studies that, while we are accused of

8       being associated with heart disease, there have

9       been studies conducted over 10 years that would

10       say, again, that science is still puzzled over

11        these forces.

12            (The video clip concluded.)

13   BY MR. UITERWYK:

14       Q.   This was in 1984 still?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   All right. Now, did -- do we have evidence

17   that, in fact, they continued with this -- this

18   proposition that it's not been proven, that we don't

19   know, in other forms of evidence as well?

20       A.   Yeah. I mean, they had the print ads; they

21    had the television appearances. You have the

22   spokespeople from The Tobacco Institute, essentially,

23   coming out and doing the same thing. They have

24   responses to consumer letters that came in to the

25   company, as well as letters that would come in from

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=443
3399

1    school children that the companies would respond to.

2   And there were form letters that were developed for --

3   by the company to respond to these comments,

4   essentially reiterating what we just saw in that video.

5       Q.   And let's look at one of those letters you

6   are referring to, PT1433, if we could, please.

7            And can you briefly tell the jury the

8   background of this particular letter?

9       A.   Sure. This was a letter --

10       Q.   And this is in 1990?

11        A.   Yeah, this was 1990. So 25 years after

12   the -- almost to the date of the Surgeon General's

13   report, January 11th. It was sent to the principal of

14   the Willow Ridge Elementary School in Amherst, New

15   York. This letter I received, actually, from the

16   nurse, because I had gone in to talk to the fifth

17   graders at this school in the fall and had encouraged

18   the children who were --1 asked the teachers, What are

19   the kids learning?

20            They said, They are learning how to write

21    letters, business letters.

22            And I said, Well, why don't they write the

23   companies and ask them why they allow their logos to be

24   used on toy and candy products.

25            I gave my lecture as I, by the way, did for 3400

1    about 20 years, to the students at Willow Ridge

2   Elementary School. I have gone every year, as I did to

3   many of the schools in western New York. And to my

4   surprise, this letter came back to the principal in

5   January, because the students had written letters. And

6   they got this response back from R.J. Reynolds

7   indicating that the tobacco industry considers smoking

8   to be a custom for those adults who derive pleasure

9   from it. We believe that whether to smoke or not is a

10   decision that should be freely made by individuals who

11    have reached the age of mature judgment, and that the

12   tobacco industry itself was concerned about the charges

13   being made about smoking.

14       Q.   And what do they say -- continue on to the

15   bottom of the page.

16       A.   This is what I found most interesting,

17   because they said in the last paragraph, on the first

18   page, said, Despite all the research going on, the

19   simple and unfortunate fact is that scientists don't

20   know the cause or causes of chronic diseases reported

21    to be associated with smoking. The answer to these

22   many unanswered controversies surrounding smoking and

23   the fundamental causes of the diseases often

24   statistically associated with smoking, we believe, can

25   only be determined through much more scientific 3401

1   research. And our company intends, therefore, to

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=444
2   continue to support such research and a continuing

3   search for answers. We would appreciate you passing

4   this information along to your students. You may also

5   be interested in the enclosed publication representing

6   the position of our company and the tobacco industry on

7   the issue of youth smoking.

8            MR. UITERWYK: Would you put up the second

9       page there? Okay. Just a circle there. There is

10       a line through it that, Judge, we should have

11        redacted.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   You read from that letter, right?

14       A.   I did.

15       Q.   And in that letter, they basically -- what

16   they said is, Besides, we do not know the cause. And

17   then they go on that --

18            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Meaning

19       and intent.

20            MR. UITERWYK: He's right. I'll withdraw it.

21             THE COURT: Sustained.

22   BY MR. UITERWYK:

23       Q.   But did he say in that letter, We would

24   appreciate your passing this information along to your

25   students? 3402

1        A.   That's right.

2       Q.   Have you seen other letters like this --

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.    involving other schools?

5       A.   Yes. I have letters -- a whole collection of

6   them. I have seen the form letters that are identical

7   that they would send out to school children, and I've

8   seen letters -- almost the identical letter written to

9   school children, a fourth grade class in 1968. So

10   between 1968 and 1990, there was no change in the

11   position of R.J. Reynolds as to what they would

12   communicate to elementary school children about the

13   science of smoking and disease.

14       Q.   In your review of all the documents, the many

15   documents that you reviewed, have you ever seen

16   anything to indicate that the cigarette industry, and

17   particularly these defendants, did not want the public

18   and particularly their customers to rely on their

19   statements that cigarettes were not injurious to their

20   health?

21             MR. WALKER: Observation: leading; compound

22       question.

23            THE COURT: Sustained.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   In your review of the documents, did you see 3403

1    anything from these defendants indicating that they did

2   not want the public to rely on their statements that

3   cigarettes were not injurious to their health?

4            MR. WALKER: Objection. Relevance.

5            THE COURT: Overruled.

6            THE WITNESS: No. Just the opposite. They

7       expected their customers to rely on their public

8       statements that they made representing their

9       product as, basically, safe to use.

10   BY MR. UITERWYK:

11        Q.   Now, we've seen some documents publicly

12   disavowing or disagreeing with the Surgeon General --

13   strike that.

14            Have you seen documents from RJR and

15   Lorillard publicly disavowing or disagreeing with the

16   Surgeon General's warning on the cigarettes?

17       A.   Have I seen documents with them disagreeing?

18   Yes.

19       Q.   Okay. And did they actually fight the

20   warning labels?

21        A.   Yes, they did.

22            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

23       Relevance, privilege.

24            THE COURT: Approach.

25            (At the bench) 3404

1            THE COURT: Refresh my memory. What's the

2       privilege?

3            MR. WALKER: There is a First Amendment

4       privilege for activities that a person or company

5       engages in petitioning government for -- with

6       respect to pending legislation. It's a privilege

7       under the United States Constitution, the First

8       Amendment. It's also a privilege under Florida

9       law. There are numerous cases on it, including a

10       case called Lodar.

11             MR. UITERWYK: But it's not only testifying,

12       but they did it in many different ways. They

13       fought the labels in the correspondence

14       themselves. They have fought the labels -- we

15       discussed the labels. I mean, they can have the

16       privilege, but it doesn't mean that I can't talk

17       about it.

18            MR. WALKER: That's what a privilege is.

19            MR. PEDROSA: It does mean that. The First

20       Amendment guarantees all citizens, including

21        corporations, the right to petition and to lobby

22       for what they want out of legislation, to punish a

23       company for exercising that right. It would

24       violate the First Amendment. To put on evidence

25       in a case for the purpose of convincing a jury to 3405

1       punish a defendant for doing that is equally

2       violative of the First Amendment.

3            MR. UITERWYK: And they did not -- they

4       fought the warning labels, not only in Congress,

5       but they fought it in other arenas as well.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=446
6            MR. PEDROSA: But it all goes back to trying

7       to affect public policy via legislation, and that

8       is absolutely protected by the First Amendment.

9            MR. UITERWYK: Everything is protected by the

10       First Amendment. That doesn't mean that we can't

11        talk about it.

12            MR. WALKER: That's exactly what it means,

13       Judge.

14            MR. UITERWYK: Just because it's protected by

15       the First Amendment doesn't mean it's not

16       admissible.

17            MR. WALKER: The case law relates to

18       imposition of liability or the imposition of

19       punitive damages for engaging in First Amendment

20       protected activity.

21             THE COURT: So if the company knows that what

22       they are selling is absolutely poison, a

23       hypothetical, and it's poison in the amount that

24       consumers would purchase, whatever that amount is,

25       and government wants to put a label on it and they 3406

1        tell Congress it's not poison; it's perfectly good

2       for you; it may taste bad like spinach but it's

3       good, that that's protected?

4            MR. WALKER: The statements made to Congress

5       are protected because otherwise you can have

6       people suing each other over what they told

7       Congress. It would be like trying to sue the NRA

8       over statements they might make about the extent

9       to which guns kill people. You cannot do that.

10            MR. PEDROSA: And to be clear, if you make a

11        false statement to Congress while under subpoena

12       or under oath, there are perjury ramifications

13       and--that's criminal--and civilly. If you

14       don't warn and you need to warn, there may be a

15       claim for failure to warn. But the only fact

16       relevant there is whether or not there was a

17       warning. The activity taken in lobbying Congress,

18       petitioning Congress whether or not to pass

19       legislation is what's protected.

20            THE COURT: All right. I'm going to have to

21        look at that issue and that line. So can you move

22       forward on around that?

23            MR. UITERWYK: I can move forward. I may be

24       done before -- before we break for lunch, so I

25       just don't -- they are going to embrace these 3407

1        warnings. They're going to be talking like these

2       warnings are the best thing that they've ever done

3       for the industry.

4            THE COURT: Well, maybe on redirect. Do you

5       have the cases handy you can give me?

6            MR. WALKER: I don't have the cases. I could

7       probably find the cites for you relatively

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=447
8       quickly.

9            MR. UITERWYK: Well, what I'll do is, Judge,

10       he -- can I tell you? He will bring up the

11        warnings, I guarantee you, during cross.

12            MR. WALKER: I will not bring up the

13       legislation about the warnings and the issue of

14       whether --

15            THE COURT: I don't know where he is going or

16       I would rule on it.

17            MR. UITERWYK: I'll cross-examine him about

18       it --1 can do it by redirect, rather.

19            THE COURT: This isn't my computer, and I

20       don't have the access to my password with me to

21        get -- get on Westlaw, so --

22            MR. UITERWYK: Judge, I'll just go ahead --

23            THE COURT: Yeah, go ahead.

24            MR. UITERWYK: -- and then come back to it if

25       necessary. 3408

1            THE COURT: Okay.

2            MR. UITERWYK: Okay.

3            THE COURT: And if you have anything you can

4       give me that I can look at while he's questioning

5       the witness on this issue?

6            MR. WALKER: I can find the cites, but I

7       don't have the cases here.

8            THE COURT: Okay.

9            MR. WALKER: I know one case is SINART.

10       That's a fairly distinct name that might be easy

11        to find.

12            THE COURT: Ask one of the attorneys if they

13       could find something for me.

14            MR. UITERWYK: Can I take two seconds, Judge?

15            THE COURT: Yeah. That's fine, take a

16       couple.

17            (In open court)

18            MR. UITERWYK: What I'm going to do is move

19       on.

20            THE COURT: Okay. That's fine.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Fine.

22   BY MR. UITERWYK:

23       Q.   Was there anything preventing these

24   defendants and the other cigarette companies or the

25   members of the TIRC and TI from putting warning labels 3409

1    on their cigarettes in the 1940s, 1950s, and the 1960s,

2   up to 1966?

3       A.   No.

4       Q.   Did they ever look at putting warning labels

5   on their packs of cigarettes, voluntarily put warning

6   labels on their cigarettes prior to 1966?

7       A.   No.

8       Q.   The ones that were put on in 1966, were they

9   voluntary?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=448
10       A.   No. Those were required by Congress.

11        Q.   Now, we're going to go through a number of

12   documents fairly quickly, and I'll try to see if we can

13   finish your direct before lunch. And we've talked

14   about there's a whole lot of other documents that we

15   could go through, but we're going to go through some

16   examples of that. And we are going to look at first a

17   few documents with regard to CTR and -- which was the

18   successor to TIRC -- and how the lawyers were involved.

19   Let's first look at 2268, which is tab No. 145.

20            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, there's a privilege

21        objection as to this document, but it's one of the

22       Bliley documents that were discussed last week.

23       But Your Honor's ruling --

24            THE COURT: What tab is it?

25            MR. WALKER:  145. 3410

1            MR. UITERWYK: You did rule on this, Your

2       Honor.

3            THE COURT: Okay. Then my ruling will

4       remain.

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   Have you seen this document?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   And what is this document about?

9       A.   It's about -

10       Q.   Maybe give the background a little bit.

11        A.   A summary of minutes, a meeting of the

12   Committee on Counsel talking about the function of CTR,

13   and it gives a little history on TIRC and CTR up

14   through, you know, when they were created in 1954 up

15   through 1978. It was written by Robert Seligman, who

16   was vice-president for Philip Morris. It indicates who

17   attended. You can see that it's, again, primarily the

18   general counsels, some outside counsel as well, that

19   attended this particular meeting.

20       Q.   And Lorillard and RJR were there?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   And what did they suggest at the very

23   beginning of the meeting?

24       A.   They indicated -- this is where one of the

25   lawyers reminded all of the participants of the meeting 3411

1   that there should be, you know, no written record of

2   what transpired issued for distribution. So this is to

3   be kept internal.

4       Q.   And then on the next page, does Mr. Shinn,

5   who is a lawyer for Shook, Hardy, does he discuss a

6   little bit of the background for CTR and then, in fact,

7   tell all the participants what CTR, how they -- what

8   CTR really has been doing?

9       A.   Well, I mean, they were described in 1963 by

10   Addison Yeaman as primarily, you know, were created as

11    a public relations gesture. In 1965 they basically

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=449
12   started funding these special projects, which were the

13   lawyer-controlled projects to provide counter evidence

14   against the smoking and health that got widely picked

15   up in the white papers and carried out as part of the

16   public relations campaign, the controversy.

17            So he says, CTR -- as an organization called

18   Tobacco Industry Research Council, or TIRC. It was set

19   up as an industry shield in 1954.

20       Q.   And then he goes on. What did he tell in the

21    rest of the report?

22       A.   He says, CTR has helped our legal counsel by

23   giving advice and technical information which was

24   needed at court trials. He said, CTR has supplied

25   spokespersons for the industry at Congressional 3412

1   hearings. The monies spent at CTR provided a base for

2   the introduction of witnesses. And Bill Shinn feels

3   that special projects are the best way that monies are

4   spent. On these projects, CTR has acted as a front;

5   however, there are many times when CTR has been

6   reluctant to serve in that capacity and, in rare

7   instances, they have refused to serve in that capacity.

8   In other words -- that's what it says.

9            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I renew the motion

10       that I made during opening.

11             THE COURT: Overruled.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   Are there other documents that also reflect

14   that CTR and TIRC were, in fact, a shield, that they

15   have acted as a front on these special projects, and

16   that they supplied information to the lawyers including

17   scientists for at trials and so forth?

18            MR. WALKER: Objection: compound question

19       and 90.403.

20            THE COURT: Sustained.

21    BY MR. UITERWYK:

22       Q.   Let me rephrase the question. Are there

23   other documents which reflect that they provided legal

24   counsel with technical information and witnesses?

25       A.   Yes. 3413

1        Q.   Did CTR also provide information in

2   connection with litigation?

3            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

4       Relevance; 90.403.

5            THE COURT: Sustained.

6   BY MR. UITERWYK:

7       Q.   Did CTR continue -- were there other

8   documents which reflected that CTR was a front,

9   continued as a front?

10       A.   Yes. I've reviewed all the science, and I

11    interviewed scientists who got grants from CTR. And

12   most of the science that was funded by the Scientific

13   Advisory Board --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=450
14            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, nonresponsive.

15            THE COURT: Sustained.

16   BY MR. UITERWYK:

17       Q.   Who controlled, based on your review of the

18   documents, when it continued to act as a front, as a

19   shield, like that described in this document, and

20   thereafter, who controlled the work that was done by --

21    was decided who would do the work and where it would go

22   and how it was done and so forth?

23       A.   Well, the special projects work was selected

24   by the lawyers and managed by the lawyers who were

25   working for the companies. 3414

1        Q.   And I'm going -- going over some kind of

2   the -- going over some additional documents, you know.

3   We talked about the -- their press releases as it

4   relates to the Surgeon General. And there's one more

5   that I wanted you to see before we finished today. And

6   that's PT2583.

7            Is that another one that you've selected?

8       A.   Yes.

9       Q.   That's tab No. 146. What is the significance

10   of that date, again, '72? It says January 10th.

11        A.   Yeah. Typically, the Surgeon General's

12   reports get issued on the 11th of January, so this was

13   a press release from William Kloepfer from The Tobacco

14   Institute commenting on the Surgeon General's report

15   that was going to be released.

16       Q.   In pursuing their press conference science,

17   some government officials maintain that cigarette

18   smoking is the No. 1 public health problem. We believe

19   the No. 1 problem is the extent to which these

20   officials knowingly mislead the American public. The

21    Surgeon General's statement that there is no honest

22   disagreement among experts on effects of smoking is

23   false.

24            Did I read that right?

25       A.   Yes. 3415

1        Q.   Now, did -- have you seen any statements from

2   anyone else saying that the Surgeon General's statement

3   that there was no disagreement among experts on effects

4   of smoking as being false, anyone else say that other

5   than the tobacco industry?

6       A.   No, I've not seen that.

7       Q.   And did, based on your review of the

8   information and the documents and your review of this

9   entire field and CTR and TIRC and the industry in

10   general, did they knowingly mislead the American

11   public, in your opinion?

12       A.   Yes. I mean, The Tobacco Institute was

13   created, basically, to put out the tobacco industry's

14   position on smoking and health. And they said

15   consistently it was a controversy over 50 years.

16       Q.   And did they continue with this attack on the

17   scientists and the Surgeon General in the following

18   years, including up to 1988?

19            MR. WALKER: Objection: leading;

20       argumentative.

21             THE COURT: Sustained.

22   BY MR. UITERWYK:

23       Q.   Did they continue with their press releases

24   as it relates to the Surgeon General reports?

25       A.   Yes. 3416

1        Q.   Did they do a press release in connection

2   with the 1988 Surgeon General report?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   What was the 19 the subject matter of the

5    1988 Surgeon General report?

6       A.   It was on why people smoke and, specifically,

7   nicotine addiction.

8       Q.   And did they issue a release in connection

9   with that on May 16th, 1988?

10       A.   They did.

11        Q.   And we're going to show PT2510. Are you

12   familiar with this document?

13       A.   lam.

14       Q.   And what did they say about the Surgeon

15   General's report?

16       A.   Well, they said that the claim that cigarette

17   smoking is a drug addiction similar to cocaine, heroin,

18   or alcohol use is irresponsible. The message to the

19   American public and, in particular, American youth is

20   that using illegal drugs such as crack or heroin or

21    alcohol has the same risk of addiction as smoking. To

22   convey this message is to invite disaster and

23   trivialize the serious drug problem faced by society.

24            So they, you know, as you can see from the

25   title, said, Claims that cigarettes are addictive, 3417

1   irresponsible and scare tactics.

2       Q.   Claims that cigarettes are addictive, what

3   was the date of Mr. Yeaman's memo regarding cigarettes

4   being addictive?

5       A.   The implications of Battelle and HIPPO?

6       Q.   Yes.

7       A.   That was July 17th, 1963.

8       Q.   And were there other documents that also

9   talked about cigarettes being addictive?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   And during this entire time frame from the

12   fifties to even here?

13       A.   Sure. I've found documents in the 1950s,

14   sixties, seventies, eighties, nineties. Internal, they

15   knew their products were addictive, and they made their

16   cigarettes to make them addictive.

17       Q.   Did the cigarette companies admit that

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=452
18   cigarettes were addictive in the public?

19            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor. Asked

20       and answered.

21             THE COURT: Sir?

22            MR. WALKER: Asked and answered.

23            THE COURT: Overruled.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   Go ahead. 3418

1        A.   No. They did not admit that their cigarettes

2   were addictive to the public in 1988 or actually

3   through the 1990s.

4       Q.   And did they, in fact -- were they questioned

5   on that issue before Congress and asked about

6   cigarettes being addictive?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   And what we are going to see is PT1771 and

9    1772. Can you give the jury a background of this

10   particular thing that we're going to be -- of the

11   particular clip that we're going to be seeing?

12       A.   Sure. This is a clip of the Congressional

13   hearing that was held in April of 1994, and the

14   executives for each of the major cigarette

15   manufacturers was requested to provide -- you know,

16   appear before Congress and provided written statements

17   or testimony in advance. And this particular clip was

18   at the end of that process. And I believe it is

19   Congressman Ron Wyden -- now Senator Wyden, but at the

20   time he was a Congressman -- asked each of the

21    executives under oath what their opinion was about

22   whether cigarettes were addictive or not.

23            MR. WALKER: First Amendment privilege

24       objection, Your Honor, in addition to the

25       objections made earlier. 3419

1            THE COURT: All right. Approach on this one.

2            (At the bench)

3            MR. UITERWYK: This video has been used in

4       every single --

5            THE COURT: I just want to make clear on my

6       understanding. Is this the same First Amendment

7       privilege as you talked about --

8            MR. WALKER: Yes.

9            THE COURT: - a few minutes -

10            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. These

11        executives who appear in this video were called to

12       give testimony at a Congressional hearing at

13       which -- that the committee was considering

14       legislation, or additional legislation. And the

15       comments --

16            THE COURT: There was already legislation at

17       this point on cigarettes, was there not?

18            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. But the

19       committee was considering further legislation or

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=453
20       making changes. That was the point of it. It was

21        a Congressional hearing to consider legislation.

22       The testimony was given in that context.

23            MR. UITERWYK: This has been admitted for

24       every --

25            THE COURT: Yeah, I know. But I've got to 3420

1        make up my own mind.

2            What did they say in this?

3            MR. UITERWYK: They answered the question,

4       Are cigarettes addictive? And they go, No.

5            THE COURT: And is that the extent of it?

6            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah. They ask each one of

7       them.

8            MR. WALKER: By the way, it was after she had

9       already quit smoking.

10            THE COURT: Sir?

11             MR. WALKER: It was after Mrs. Loyd had

12       already quit smoking.

13            THE COURT: Oh, okay. Well, that's a

14       different objection. I was just focusing -- okay.

15       I'm going to allow it.

16            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Thank you, Judge.

17            (In open court)

18            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, before I show

19       this, I actually skipped over an exhibit that I

20       wanted to do, and I was reminded that I had

21        skipped over it, and it's sitting right here. I

22       apparently turned the page and missed it.

23            THE COURT: All right.

24   BY MR. UITERWYK:

25       Q.   If I could, before I show this Waxman 3421

1   hearing, what I would like to do -- in connection with

2   this video and in connection with the subject of

3   addiction and nicotine addiction, are you familiar with

4   a document called Smoker Psychology, PT1809?

5       A.   Yeah. Smoker Psychology, a program review,

6    1977, from Philip Morris.

7       Q.   And why is this document important at this

8   particular point in your testimony, as we talk about

9   addiction again and we talk about what they said to

10   Congress and so forth?

11        A.   Well, the Smoker Psychology program at Philip

12   Morris was very much focused on trying to understand

13   the scientific basis of why people smoked and continued

14   to smoke. And they provide in this particular document

15   a, you know, a fairly deep understanding of the factors

16   that contribute to continued smoking in people. And

17   that's 1977.

18       Q.   And who prepared this document?

19       A.   Bill Dunn.

20       Q.   And who is Mr. Dunn, again?

21        A.   He was the director of that program, the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=454
22   Smoker Psychology research program at Philip Morris.

23   And it's copied to Tom Osdene, who was the then

24   director of research at Philip Morris.

25       Q.   All right. And was he involved -- was Osdene 3422

1    also involved in the TIRC, The Tobacco Institute?

2       A.   Well, they were certainly -- they were

3   involved on the technical research committee, Dr.

4   Osdene in particular.

5            MR. UITERWYK: All right. All right.

6       Let's -- if we could go to that, please, 1809,

7       PT1809.

8   BY MR. UITERWYK:

9       Q.   And he said, I have taken this as an occasion

10   to review our basic premises, to ask myself, Why are we

11    doing the things we're doing? It isn't easy to examine

12   the rationale for one's own existence. First, every

13   undertaking has to have some mission. I would state

14   our charter from Philip Morris in this --1 would state

15   our charter from Philip Morris in this fashion: Study

16   the psychology of a smoker in search of information

17   that can increase corporate profits. Our charter is

18   unique in that we are given the smoker to study.

19            And did they, in fact, study the smoker?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Did all the cigarette companies study the

22   smoker?

23       A.   Yes, they did.

24       Q.   And all the cigarette companies studied why

25   the smoker smokes, becomes addicted? 3423

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   And he goes on: We get the whole smoker to

3   ourselves, but there isn't that much freedom, really,

4   because the charter demands that the research have some

5   promise for dollar payout.

6            And then he goes on in the next page -- next

7   pages, Bates 3. And he's talking here about cigarette

8   smoking addiction and how it works. Is that correct?

9       A.   That's right.

10       Q.   And in doing that, he said, There are some

11    distinctive features about the cigarette market. We

12   sell a product that is bought often and used from 10 to

13   60 times a day, day in and day out. We provide a

14   product that is an essential commodity in a habitual

15   act. It is inevitable, therefore, that we focus upon

16   habit formation and habit maintenance and that we make

17   use of the conceptual model specifically designed to

18   explain habit formation.

19            And is this -- during this time, is Philip

20   Morris and the others doing their designing,

21    engineering, and manipulation to cause and sustain

22   addiction?

23       A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=455
24       Q.   The model is known within psychology as the

25   Skinnerian --3424

1        A.   Skinnerian.

2       Q.    Skinnerian operant conditioning model.

3   You are all familiar with Pavlov's dog.

4            What is Pavlov's?

5       A.   Well, in psychology, Pavlov's dog was the

6   experiment where they showed how they could, you know,

7   basically give a reward to an animal and condition a

8   certain response from that animal. So they used a

9   bell. So every time that the animal received food, it,

10   you know, heard the bell. So the bell always preceded

11    the food. So when you removed the actual food and you

12   just rang the bell after this learning process had gone

13   on, just ringing the bell, the dog would salivate.

14            And so they are describing here, you know,

15   You are familiar with Pavlov's dog. Present a dog

16   food. He salivates. Ring a bell each time you present

17   the food. And in due time you can ring the bell

18   without the food, and he will salivate. This is

19   classical conditioning. The bell, a conditioned

20   stimulus, will elicit the unconditioned response.

21             Operant Conditioning is quite different.

22   Consider the classical operant experiment. Put a

23   hungry rat in a cage. Put a lever in the cage. Make

24   it so that a push on the lever delivers a pellet of

25   food. In its random movements, the rat will push the 3425

1   lever. He will get one pellet. The rat will soon

2   associate lever pushing with the food pellet. In time

3   he will rapidly -- he will be rapidly pushing the lever

4   for food.

5       Q.   Does he go on and actually compare what he

6   describes as a rat in a cage and pushing the lever with

7   that of a smoker?

8            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, the

9       document speaks for itself.

10            THE COURT: It's preliminary. Yes.

11        Overruled.

12   BY MR. UITERWYK:

13       Q.   And what does he say in that regard?

14       A.   He says consider the smoker. Smoking the

15   cigarette is the lever press. The effect of that

16   smoking act upon his person is the reward. The effect

17   reinforces the smoking act. He comes to push the lever

18    10 to 60 times per day. Our task is to understand the

19   reinforcing mechanism or process whereby the habit is

20   established and maintained. Such is our model,

21    conceptually simple on the surface, but the

22   complexities lurk in numbers beneath the surface.

23       Q.   And then on next page, I believe, does he

24   talk about what chemical compound is needed to

25   continue?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=456
3426

1        A.   That's right. He said without the chemical

2   compound, the cigarette market would collapse, Philip

3   Morris would collapse, and we would all lose our jobs

4   and our consulting fees.

5            When he talks about chemical, nicotine is the

6   component.

7       Q.   Now with that in mind, and also in mind the

8   discussions we've had regarding the press releases as

9   it relates to the 1988 Surgeon General report on

10   addiction and other documents in that regard, we're

11    going to be watching the Waxman hearings; is that

12   correct?

13       A.   Correct.

14       Q.   And this was all the heads of all the

15   companies?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   Who is the one from Lorillard and who is the

18   one from R. J. Reynolds?

19       A.   Mr. Tisch is the president of Lorillard who

20   appeared at this hearing, and, you know, Mr. Johnston

21    is the president of R.J. Reynolds who appeared on

22   behalf of R.J. Reynolds at the hearing.

23            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Let's go ahead and play

24       the clip.

25            (A video clip was played for the jury as 3427

1        follows:)

2            A SPEAKER: I would like you to rise, and

3       those who will be testifying as well, you to rise.

4       If you would raise your right hand? Do you swear

5       that the testimony you are about to give is the

6       truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

7            (Persons responded.)

8            A SPEAKER: Please consider yourself to be

9       under oath.

10            A SPEAKER: Let me begin my questioning on

11        the matter of whether or not nicotine is

12       addictive.

13            Let me ask you first, and I would like to go

14       down the row, whether each of you believes that

15       nicotine is not addictive. I heard virtually all

16       of you touch on it. Just yes or no. Do you

17       believe nicotine is not addictive?

18            A SPEAKER: I believe nicotine is not

19       addictive, yes.

20            A SPEAKER: Mr. Johnston?

21             A SPEAKER: Congressman, cigarettes and

22       nicotine clearly do not meet the classic

23       definition of addiction. There is no

24       intoxication --

25            A SPEAKER: We will take that as a no. And 3428

1       again, time is short. If you could just --1

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=457
2       think each of you believe nicotine is not

3       addictive, and we just would like to have this for

4       the record.

5            A SPEAKER: I don't believe that nicotine or

6       our products are addictive.

7            A SPEAKER: I believe nicotine is not

8       addictive.

9            A SPEAKER: I believe that nicotine is not

10       addictive.

11             A SPEAKER: I believe that nicotine is not

12       addictive.

13            A SPEAKER: And I too believe that nicotine

14       is not addictive.

15            A SPEAKER: Mr. Campbell, you were also

16       deposed, and you said, quote, to my knowledge it

17       has not been proven that cigarette smoking causes

18       cancer. This is a rather passive and puzzling

19       approach, especially in the light of the consensus

20       not by some but all of the scientific community.

21       Will you ever be convinced, and what evidence are

22       you waiting for? Let's have the microphone passed

23       over.

24            A SPEAKER: Yes, I may be convinced. We

25       don't know what causes cancer in general right 3429

1        now, so I --1 think that we may find out what

2       causes cancer and we may find out some

3       relationship, which has yet to be proven.

4            (The video clip at concluded.)

5   BY MR. UITERWYK:

6       Q.   What year is this?

7       A.   1994.

8       Q.   Now, Doctor, and we also saw Mr. -- we saw

9   Mr. Johnston from Reynolds, we also saw Mr. Tisch from

10   Lorillard as well, was one of those people?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Now, I wanted to ask, as we close out your

13   testimony, Dr. Cummings, all that we've talked about --

14            THE COURT: Close out direct.

15            MR. UITERWYK: Direct testimony. I meant to

16       say that. Yes. Thanks.

17   BY MR. UITERWYK:

18       Q.   All that we've heard and talked about today

19   and yesterday and the last few days about the

20   conspiracy, about the cover-up, about the creation of

21    doubt, about the public concealment and those issues

22   that we've talked about yesterday and today in that

23   regard, what does this have to do with Jacqueline Loyd

24   as an addicted smoker?

25       A.   I think everything. 3430

1        Q.   Tell the jury, please.

2       A.   Sure. She got started as a young person at a

3   time when, you know, many young people were taking up

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=458
4   smoking. It was a normative thing to do. The

5   companies early on during the time that she took up

6   smoking knew that their products were harmful, and

7   certainly concealed that information from her

8   throughout her lifetime. And you can't make decisions

9   without having effects.

10            They -- as information began to come out

11    about the smoking and health issue, they basically

12   denied the risks and said it was unproven, a

13   controversy, we have filters, we have low tar. And

14   she, in fact, went to filters. She later went to low

15   tar. She even used low tar under the misguided belief

16   that she was getting less nicotine and would help to

17   quit.

18            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

19       Speculation and conduit for --

20            THE COURT: Sustained.

21    BY MR. UITERWYK:

22       Q.   Those smokers who used -- who switched to

23   filters in the fifties, '54, who switched to low tar in

24   the 1980s, what has your research shown as to what was

25   their perception for doing so? 3431

1        A.   People who went to filters did so because

2   they felt they were lowering their -- lowering their

3   risk of developing disease. They thought the filter

4   would take out certain tars and nicotine. They did not

5   know they would actually get more carcinogens,

6   potentially, they would actually be drawing stuff

7   deeper into the lungs. They didn't know about all the

8   design changes that went on in products like Winston --

9   28 design changes just during the period from 1954 to

10    1983. That was not told to the consumers of those

11   products. Every one of those modifications potentially

12   could be affecting how somebody might be inhaling their

13   product. And as a result, a lot of people got sick.

14       Q.   All right. Now, let's look at one more

15   document, if we could, please, Dr. Cummings, before we

16   finish with your direct. 2184.

17            Are you familiar with this document which is

18   between Mr. Kloepfer and Mr. Knopick?

19       A.   Yes, I am.

20       Q.   First of all, who are -- we've seen, I think,

21    their names before. But briefly, who are they and who

22   are they with and your -- when was this document?

23       A.   Well, Mr. Knopick was the editor of the

24   Tobacco Observer, which was essentially the Tobacco and

25   Health Report. They changed the name, calling it the 3432

1   Tobacco Observer. This was sent out widely. It would

2   track evidence about smoking and health, and this was a

3   publication that the Tobacco Institute would regularly

4   publish.

5            And so Mr. Knopick would be tracking things

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=459
6   appearing in publications on smoking and health. Mr.

7   Knopick was vice-president in charge of essentially

8   public relations for The Tobacco Institute. And so

9   those are the two employees.

10            So this is an internal memo from The Tobacco

11    Institute, September 9th, 1980. And they are talking

12   about the issue of addiction, which had started to come

13   out as a result of some -- a meeting that had been held

14   at NIDA, the National Institute on Drug Abuse at that

15   time.

16       Q.   And why did you choose to show this document

17   to the jury today, Dr. Cummings?

18       A.   Well, it's talking about -- again,

19   understanding from the companies about what their goal

20   was on the issue of smoking and health, and

21   particularly as it relates to nicotine addiction. And

22   they're basically talking about the issue of whether

23   it's choice or not.

24            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor.

25            THE COURT: Overruled. 3433

1   BY MR. UITERWYK:

2       Q.   Let me, before -- were you done?

3       A.   They are basically talking about whether this

4   is about choice or whether addiction impedes free

5   choice. That's what they are talking about.

6       Q.   And was this -- this also, all those years in

7   the past, the cigarette companies insisted that

8   cigarettes were not addictive and smoking was just a

9   matter of choice --

10            MR. WALKER: Objection, leading.

11    BY MR. UITERWYK:

12       Q.    prior to this day?

13            THE COURT: Sustained. Sustained.

14   BY MR. UITERWYK:

15       Q.   Leading up to this particular document, had

16   the cigarette -- did the cigarette companies deny

17   addiction?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   And say it was all a matter of choice?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   And what did -- was concluded in this

22   particular document in 1980, if we could read that,

23   please?

24       A.   Sure. It says, I don't think the questions I

25   now raise are academic. 3434

1            And this is over the question of nicotine

2   addiction.

3            It says, The lawyers remind us, I'm told,

4   that the entire matter of addiction is the most potent

5   weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung

6   cancer/cigarette case. We can't defend continued

7   smoking as "free choice" if the person was "addicted.

8       Q.   In your opinion, was Jackie Loyd addicted?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   And in your opinion, did the cigarette --

11    strike that.

12            Let me ask you a couple more questions.

13            In your opinion, did the defendants' design,

14   engineering and manipulation of their cigarettes cause

15   Jackie Loyd's addiction?

16       A.   Caused her continued use of cigarettes.

17       Q.   And continued to maintain her addiction?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   But for her addiction, would she have smoked

20   one to two packs a day for over 40 years, in your

21    opinion?

22       A.   No.

23       Q.   Whose choice was it to design, engineer and

24   manipulate their cigarettes to cause and sustain

25   Jacqueline Loyd's addiction? 3435

1            MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor,

2       argumentative.

3            THE COURT: Overruled.

4            THE WITNESS: It was the defendants' choice

5       to engineer the cigarettes to be addictive and to

6       maintain nicotine addiction.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Thank you, Dr. Cummings.

8            No further questions, with the exception of

9       that one thing we discussed, Your Honor.

10            THE COURT: All right. All right. Do you

11        want to take a lunch break now before you get

12       started?

13            MR. WALKER: No, I'd actually prefer to get

14       started.

15            THE COURT: You do? Okay.

16            MR. WALKER: Yes, sir, Your Honor.

17                     CROSS-EXAMINATION

18   BY MR. WALKER:

19       Q.   Good morning, Dr. Cummings.

20       A.   Good morning.

21        Q.   I'm John Walker. You understand that I'm

22   here on behalf of the defendant R. J. Reynolds Tobacco

23   Company?

24       A.   I do.

25       Q.   All right. And you took the stand in this 3436

1    case on Tuesday of last week; is that right?

2       A.   No.

3       Q.   What day was it, sir?

4       A.   Wednesday at 11:00.

5       Q.   Wednesday. So that makes today, what, the

6   fourth day of your testimony? Is that right?

7       A.   Well, I was on for Wednesday for, you know,

8   just a couple of hours. I think most of the time was

9   spent where I was out in the hallway. And then

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=461
10   Tuesday -- Thursday I was on and Friday, but, again, a

11    lot of that time was spent not testifying before the

12   jury.

13       Q.   So this is your third day here?

14       A.   That's right.

15       Q.   Okay. I don't plan to take three days with

16   you, Dr. Cummings.

17       A.   That's good to hear.

18       Q.   I thought you might like to hear that. But

19   in order for me to do that I do want to ask, and you

20   tell me if you can do this, if I ask you a question

21    that can fairly be answered with a yes or a no, I would

22   like you to do that. Will you try to do that?

23       A.   I will do so. If I feel the need to offer an

24   explanation, I will -- I'll tell you that I feel a need

25   to offer an explanation. 3437

1        Q.   Okay. Thank you. One of the questions that

2   Mr. Uiterwyk just asked you, actually, was something

3   along lines of this, right? What does this have to do

4   with Jacqueline Loyd? You remember when he asked you

5   that question, right?

6       A.   I do.

7       Q.   He didn't ask you that question on Wednesday,

8   did he?

9       A.   No.

10       Q.   He didn't ask you that question on Thursday?

11        A.   No.

12       Q.   He didn't ask you that question on Friday?

13       A.   No.

14       Q.   So today is the first day that you actually

15   answered this question about What does this have to do

16   with Jacqueline Loyd?

17       A.   I answered a lot of questions about

18   Jacqueline Loyd, but that specific question was asked

19   today.

20       Q.   Okay. Well, I want to talk with you some

21    more about some issues that relate to that. First of

22   all, I want to ask you about this book of cigarette

23   ads.

24       A.   Sure.

25       Q.   All right. Now, before I do, I just want to 3438

1    confirm, did you testify that you have 10,000 print ads

2   in your collection?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   Ten thousand?

5       A.   Well, around that.

6       Q.   Somewhere in that vicinity.

7       A.   Uh-huh (Affirmative response).

8       Q.   Now, this book has 37 ads in it; is that

9   right?

10       A.   About that, yeah.

11        Q.   Okay. Who put this book of cigarette ads

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=462
12   together? Did you do that or did the lawyers do that?

13       A.   I had -- identified some ads that I had sent

14   as part of my preparation before I was deposed in this

15   case. And but then the actual printing of the ads and

16   so on were selected by the attorneys.

17       Q.   But the choice of ads, that was your doing?

18       A.   It was I think jointly done.

19       Q.   Okay. And it was selected for this case,

20   right?

21        A.   Yes, sir.

22       Q.   And that was selected for this case about

23   Jacqueline Loyd?

24       A.   That's right.

25       Q.   And when you put this book together, you had 3439

1    already done some research into the facts as they

2   pertained to Jacqueline Loyd, right?

3       A.   Right.

4       Q.   So you knew, for example, when she was born?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   You knew when she passed away?

7       A.   That's correct.

8       Q.   You knew what her brand history was, or at

9   least what the reports were of her brand history,

10   right?

11        A.   Yes, sir.

12       Q.   All right. And you chose these ads

13   presumably because you thought they would in some sense

14   be helpful to the jury, right?

15       A.   They were a representative of ads that I

16   thought would be helpful in terms of explaining to the

17   jury something of the culture of advertising during the

18   time that she grew up, yes.

19       Q.   So out of the 10,000 ads that you have at

20   your disposal, you chose these ads presumably because

21    you thought they would be helpful to the jury --

22       A.   I did.

23       Q.    in this case about Jacqueline Loyd?

24       A.   Yes, sir.

25       Q.   All right. Let's take a look at what you 3440

1    chose.

2       A.   Sure.

3       Q.   And first let me ask you, did you realize

4   when you put this together that out of the 10,000 ads

5   that you had at your disposal and the 37 you chose for

6   this book, there are only nine ads for Winston in this

7   book? Did you know that?

8       A.   No.

9       Q.   Does that surprise you?

10       A.   At the -- does it surprise me, no?

11        Q.   It doesn't surprise you that only had nine

12   ads for Winston?

13       A.   We weren't going to sit here and show the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=463
14   jury 10,000 ads.

15       Q.   Right. Nine is what you are going to show,

16   right?

17       A.   No. I mean I can go onto my website and you

18   can type in for a given year and, you know, the brand,

19   and it will give you all of the ads.

20       Q.   You've done this before. You know that the

21   jury can't go online and run searches for these ads,

22   right?

23       A.   Right.

24       Q.   They are only going to see what you brought

25   in your presentation, right? 3441

1        A.   Yes, sir.

2       Q.   Okay. So the first ad that you pick is

3   actually an ad for Camels, right?

4       A.   That's right.

5       Q.   And you said that this ad was from the late

6    1920s or the early 1930s, right?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   I wrote it down when you said that. So this

9   ad came out before Jacqueline Loyd was born; is that

10   right?

11        A.   Yes, sir, that's true.

12       Q.   Now this ad doesn't appear to show a

13   newspaper or a magazine. Can you tell the jury exactly

14   when and where this ad ran?

15       A.   I indicated when previously, as you just

16   indicated. I don't know what publications that it

17   appeared in.

18       Q.   Well, you said you indicated when. You gave

19   kind of a general indication of when, right?

20       A.   That's right.

21        Q.   If this ad had run in the newspaper that you

22   had, you would be able to give an exact date, wouldn't

23   you?

24       A.   If I had the actual newspaper, yes,

25   certainly. 3442

1        Q.   Or if it ran in a magazine. If you had the

2   magazine that ran this ad, you would be able to give an

3   exact date?

4       A.   That's true.

5       Q.   And you would be able to tell this jury

6   where, if anywhere, this ad ran, wouldn't you?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   Let's take a look at the next one. All

9   right? This is another ad for Camel. This one

10   actually has written on it 1932, right?

11        A.   That's right.

12       Q.   So we know that this is another ad that came

13   out before Mrs. Loyd was even born, right?

14       A.   That's correct.

15       Q.   Can you tell the jury where this ad ran, if

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=464
16   at all?

17       A.   I don't know the actual publication. It may

18   have run in many publications. I don't know.

19       Q.   When you say you don't know the publication,

20   you can't name a single publication that your research

21    has shown that this ad ran that you showed the jury?

22       A.   No. The -- this particular ad I received

23   from Dr. Polife.

24       Q.   Okay. So you got this from someone else, but

25   you didn't go to see if you could actually find this ad 3443

1   in a newspaper or magazine where it actually ran?

2       A.   No. I do have -- there is a 1953 --

3       Q.   Actually, that was one of those yes or no

4   questions. Right?

5       A.   Well, I need --1 can give you the

6   explanation of the source for the ad campaign if you

7   would like.

8       Q.   I'm not asking you for that.

9       A.   You don't want that?

10       Q.   No.

11        A.   That's part of the research that I have done.

12       Q.   Right. And you talked for quite a bit of the

13   research that you have done. I'm actually asking you

14   if you have examples of this ad from a magazine or a

15   newspaper where it actually ran to show this jury.

16   That's a yes or no question, right?

17       A.   I don't have the -- the answer is no. I have

18   other sources that talk about that particular ad and

19   how much they spent on it.

20       Q.   But your other sources don't tell you where

21    exactly it ran, do they?

22       A.   I would be happy to explain the other sources

23   of information--

24            THE COURT: You need to answer yes or no.

25            THE WITNESS: What was your question again? 3444

1   BY MR. WALKER:

2       Q.   Your other sources don't tell you exactly

3   where and exactly on what date that ad ran, do they?

4       A.   It didn't run on a given date. It ran over a

5   period of time, based on the sources that I have

6   reviewed. They were referred to as magazine ads and

7   newspaper ads in the source, and it indicates the

8   amount of money that was spent. These were national

9   campaigns. They weren't just run in a single local

10   newspaper or magazine.

11        Q.   Dr. Cummings, I can appreciate that's the

12   testimony you want to tell me. I'm actually asking you

13   if by any source you can tell us where that ad ran,

14   what newspaper and what magazine specifically that that

15   ad ran. You can't, can you?

16       A.   No, I can't.

17       Q.   Okay. Now let's look at another one. This

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=465
18   one now is --

19            MR. WALKER: I'm going to object. He's got

20       the demonstrative up there. That has not anything

21        to do with his questions. Underneath --

22            THE COURT: Overruled.

23   BY MR. WALKER:

24       Q.   All right. Dr. Cummings, this one, this is

25   under tab --1 guess we're still under Tab 1, right? 3445

1   This one is a Marlboro ad, right?

2       A.   That's right.

3       Q.   And you --1 believe you said you don't even

4   have the exact date for this one, right?

5       A.   I said it predated 1954.

6       Q.   You said it was sometime before 1954, right?

7       A.   Correct.

8       Q.   Okay. And you know from your review of this

9   case that Mrs. Loyd was never really a -- was never a

10   smoker of Marlboro, right?

11        A.   We don't know that precisely based on my

12   review of the case.

13       Q.   There is no evidence that she smoked

14   Marlboro, is there?

15       A.   Well, there's some but that was not -- it was

16   not her primary brand.

17       Q.   And there's no evidence that she smoked

18   Marlboro sometime before 1954 when this ad ran,

19   correct?

20       A.   There is no evidence either way.

21        Q.   Okay. But you chose to include this Marlboro

22   ad from sometime before 1954 in this case about

23   Jacqueline Loyd?

24       A.   I did choose that, yes.

25       Q.   All right. 3446

1        A.   It shows the culture of advertising.

2       Q.   All right. And then we have this Great

3   stagecoach Robbery. Do you remember that one?

4       A.   I do.

5       Q.   All right. And the date for this one, you

6   don't have an exact date when this particular thing

7   that you want to show the jury ran, do you?

8       A.   No.

9       Q.   All right. You said it was sometime in the

10    1950s, right?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   And you said this was the --1 hope I wrote

13   this down right -- the Puck Comic series?

14       A.   That's right.

15       Q.   And you said this was in the Sunday funnies,

16   right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   Which Sunday funnies was this in?

19       A.   The New York Times.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=466
20       Q.   The New York Times.

21        A.   Yeah.

22       Q.   Okay. Did you find any evidence that

23   Jacqueline Loyd was reading the New York Times?

24       A.   The New York Times syndicated their funny

25   pages, and it appeared in Sunday newspapers all over 3447

1   the country, reaching 5 million households.

2       Q.   Let's start with my question.

3       A.   Okay.

4       Q.   That was one of those yes-or-no ones. Did

5   you find any evidence that Jacqueline Loyd was reading

6   the New York Times?

7       A.   No.

8       Q.   All right. Here is another one of the ads

9   that you picked for the jury in this case about

10   Jacqueline Loyd. This is -- we're back to Camel now,

11    right?

12       A.   That's right.

13       Q.   And you said -- well, first of all, what you

14   provided doesn't even have a date anywhere on there,

15   does it?

16       A.   No.

17       Q.   Okay. But when you were asked, you said that

18   you believe that this ad was from the 1940s, right?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   Okay. So the 1940s, that would have been

21   before Mrs. Loyd ever started smoking?

22       A.   True.

23       Q.   Okay. Oh, by the way, can you tell the jury

24   exactly where this was run, if anywhere?

25       A.   That was part of the national campaign 3448

1   because of the 28 percent less nicotine. I've seen

2   many other ads for Camel cigarettes in this period in

3   the 1940s that use that market. But, I can't tell you

4   the precise locations. Again, these were the funded --

5   you know, the comic strips that were run.

6       Q.   That's your way of saying no, you can't tell

7   the jury where this particular ad ran, can you?

8       A.   I was trying to --1 think you asked two

9   questions, about time and place, so.

10       Q.   So no, you can't tell the jury where this ad

11    ran?

12       A.   That's true. All right.

This particular ad, that's right. This is the one you included, right? That's right. All right.

Yeah. It's a national campaign. Okay. Let's take a look at the next one.

20   Stars of the Circus. This one is from 1937?

21        A.   Correct.

13       Q

14       A

15       Q

16       A

17       Q

18       A

19       Q

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=467
22       Q.   How old was Mrs. Loyd in 1937?

23       A.   She would have been two.

24       Q.   Okay. Can you tell the jury exactly where

25   this ad ran when Mrs. Loyd was two years old? 3449

1        A.   Again, this is part of the Puck Comic series,

2   so the Sunday funnies.

3       Q.   In the New York Times?

4       A.   Well, you are misrepresenting the New York

5   Times. New York Times syndicated their Sunday funnies

6   and, you know, sent it to newspapers all over the

7   United States, so it wasn't just the New York Times.

8   It would have been any Sunday paper. I doubt at two

9   years old she was reading the funnies.

10       Q.   Fair enough. Let me ask -- let me ask you

11    the next question then. Where was two-year-old

12   Mrs. Loyd living in 1937?

13       A.   I believe she was living in Michigan.

14       Q.   And what would have been the paper where she

15   was living in Michigan?

16       A.   Well, I lived in Michigan, and most of us on

17   Sunday would buy the Detroit Free Press.

18       Q.   Did you look to see if this ad ever appeared

19   in a Detroit Free Press article, did you bring -- in

20   fact, let me ask you a different question. Did you

21   bring a Detroit Free Press newspaper with this ad in

22   it-

23       A.   No.

24       Q.   -- syndicated from the New York Times? No?

25       A.   No. It was part of a national campaign that 3450

1    showed the culture of advertising. That was the

2   purpose of bringing it with me.

3       Q.   So this and some of the other ones, you keep

4   coming back to that national campaign. So these are

5   about a national campaign more so than Mrs. Loyd,

6   right?

7       A.   Well, no. It's all about Mrs. Loyd because

8   Camel -- there were a few brands that were more

9   regional, but brands like Camel, Lucky Strike,

10   Chesterfield of the day were all national campaigns.

11    It's one of the things that set them apart and made

12   them among the best selling brands in the United States

13   at the time.

14       Q.   So your testimony is that this national

15   campaign when Mrs. Loyd was two years old is really

16   about Mrs. Loyd?

17       A.   It's about the culture of marketing

18   cigarettes and the brands that eventually -- you know,

19   the records that I reviewed indicate that she smoked.

20       Q.   So this ad is not really about Mrs. Loyd,

21    it's about the national campaign that you wanted to

22   talk about?

23       A.   It's about the culture of smoking and culture

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=468
24   of marketing and what the companies were communicating

25   to consumers at that time. 3451

1        Q.   All right. I could --1 don't know how many

2   of these we'll go through.

3       A.   Sure.

4       Q.   Here is another one. It's fun to be fooled.

5   This one you said was from the 1930s, right?

6       A.   That's right.

7       Q.   Do you know whether this ad ran when

8   Mrs. Loyd was already born or not?

9       A.   I believe it ran before she was born.

10       Q.   Before she was born?

11        A.   Uh-huh (Affirmative response).

12       Q.   Where did this one run?

13       A.   Again, a precise location, I don't know.

14       Q.   Okay. All right. Then you started showing

15   the jury a series of ads that relate to athletes,

16   right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   This was one of them?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   And this one you said was from 1935, right?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   It says it -- this one actually has the date

23   on there, right, 1935?

24       A.   Saturday Evening Post, yeah.

25       Q.   Saturday Evening Post? 3452

1        A.   Yeah.

2       Q.   And where did this fall in relationship to

3   Mrs. Loyd's life?

4       A.   Well she was born in 1935.

5       Q.   All right. So this is the same year she was

6   born?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   So you are showing this not so much about

9   Mrs. Loyd but about what you said earlier, the national

10   campaign, cultural -- what was it? Cultural context?

11    That's why you showed this, right?

12       A.   When I was asked about this ad, the

13   questioning was about the use of athletes who were, you

14   know, basically giving testimonials for smoking certain

15   brands of cigarettes, something that was common in the

16    1930s and 1940s and 1950s and the 1960s.

17       Q.   So this ad shows something that was common

18   the year that Mrs. Loyd wasn't even one year old yet?

19       A.   Yes. It shows that, you know, R.J. Reynolds

20   was utilizing athletes to -- and celebrities to market

21    their cigarettes.

22       Q.   In 1935?

23       A.   And 19 --1 believe when I was asked about

24   it, I said that the thirties, forties, fifties and

25   sixties.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=469
3453

1        Q.   Right. So this would be another ad that's

2   from the early 1930s, I think you said, right?

3       A.   Yeah. You can see they are talking about

4   their cigarettes are so mild you can smoke all you

5   want.

6       Q.   Okay. So you testified about these types of

7   ads in the thirties, forties, fifties and sixties, but

8   the one that you brought, the ones -- these two that

9   you brought out of the 10,000 that you have are from

10   the time period either before she was born or right

11    when she was born, right?

12       A.   No, there are some that cover her entire life

13   span.

14       Q.   I am just asking about these two that you

15   included. The last two out of the 37 are from the year

16   she was born or before, right?

17       A.   It's the last two, that's true.

18       Q.   Okay.

19       A.   Not the entire 37.

20       Q.   All right. Then at some point you started

21    showing some ads for Kent cigarettes, right?

22       A.   That's right.

23       Q.   And again we heard this highlighted, and that

24   wasn't in the original ad was it?

25       A.   No. 3454

1        Q.   And this is an ad, can you tell -- this one,

2   you do know where this one ran, right?

3       A.   That's right.

4       Q.   This one ran in the Journal of the American

5   Medical Association, right?

6       A.   That's right.

7       Q.   All right. And you can agree with me that

8   there's no evidence in record for this case that

9   Mrs. Loyd in 1954 or at any other time was ever reading

10   the Journal of the American Medical Association, was

11    she?

12       A.   There's no evidence that she was reading

13   JAMA, no.

14       Q.   All right. Nevertheless, you've included --

15   what is it? -- three ads from JAMA. Here is the next

16   one, right? That one is from JAMA, right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   All right. And then the very next one.

19   That's another ad from JAMA.

20       A.   That's correct.

21        Q.   All right. Ten thousand ads, 37 in the book,

22   three from JAMA, right?

23       A.   That's right.

24       Q.   Okay.

25       A.   Pointing out the culture, again, half of all 3455

1   doctors were smoking in that period right around the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=470
2   time period that she began smoking.

3       Q.   Uh-huh (Indicating affirmatively). Now let's

4   see. Here is another ad for Kent. I made a note of

5   this one because -- tell me if you remember this. When

6   you were answering questions about this Kent ad, you

7   started talking about brand switching, right?

8       A.   That's right.

9       Q.   You said brand switching can be an indication

10   that ads are working, right?

11        A.   Sure.

12       Q.   This ad is from 1954, isn't it?

13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   But with respect to Mrs. Loyd, she didn't

15   switch to Kent until, by some reports, sometime in the

16    1980s, right?

17       A.   Right. I believe she switched to Winston

18   right around that time.

19       Q.   Right. So that would be 30 years after this

20   ad, correct?

21        A.   That's right.

22       Q.   Okay. Let's keep going.

23       A.   Okay.

24       Q.   So out of the 10,000 ads, this is one of the

25   Kent ads you decided to show, right? 3456

1        A.   That's right.

2       Q.   And this one is from the 1950s also, right?

3       A.   That's right.

4       Q.   She wasn't smoking Kent in the fifties?

5       A.   No.

6       Q.   Okay.

7       A.   But it is showing the introduction. I can

8   explain why I selected these, if you would like.

9       Q.   I think you did explain why you selected

10   them.

11        A.   No, I did not.

12       Q.   Let's talk about this one. Maybe you can

13   explain why you selected this one after I ask you a

14   couple of initial questions.

15       A.   Okay.

16       Q.   This ad, you know where this one ran, don't

17   you? You wrote it at the top, right?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   This is Ebony Magazine?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Tell the jury what the demographic is of the

22   readers of Ebony Magazine, please?

23       A.   Primarily African American.

24       Q.   African American?

25       A.   Yes. 3457

1        Q.   Okay. And this is an ad that you chose to

2   include in this book for this case about Jacqueline

3   Loyd, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=471
4       A.   That's right.

5       Q.   Okay. By the way, didn't you see evidence in

6   this case that the types of magazines that Mrs. Loyd

7   read were not the Journal of the American Medical

8   Association or Ebony Magazine, but, in fact, she read

9   livestock magazines. You saw that didn't you?

10       A.   Yeah. She had lots of magazines.

11        Q.   Did you -- did you research to see if any

12   ads -- any of these ads or any ads like these appeared

13   in any livestock magazine? Did you do that work?

14       A.   No, I didn't do an analysis of the livestock

15   magazines.

16       Q.   Can you even name a livestock magazine? You

17   saw that referenced in the case, did. You at least try

18   to find out?

19       A.   No.

20       Q.   Okay. All right. So by the way, you said --

21    why did you include this ad from Ebony Magazine from

22    1962? I assume it wasn't because you think that

23   Mrs. Loyd was reading Ebony? That's not why you

24   included it, is it?

25       A.   No, it's not. I mean, it's part of a 3458

1   national campaign, so the actual text in the selling

2   message is identical to ads that they were running in

3   other magazines and also in in-store point of sale and

4   billboards and so on, talking about designing for

5   pleasure and talking about the filter blend, which

6   Winston has. And we did have some discussion of that

7   during my testimony.

8       Q.   So you are saying there were some other ads

9   that were similar to this that weren't in Ebony

10   Magazine?

11        A.   Sure. You can see some of it.

12       Q.   But nevertheless, you decided to include this

13   Ebony Magazine ad in this collection, right?

14       A.   Yes, because it gives a date, 1962.

15       Q.   All right. Then way in the back, this is the

16   last ad, right?

17       A.   That's the last one we included, yeah.

18       Q.   Last one, No. 37 out of 37, you decided to

19   include a single True ad, right?

20       A.   That's right.

21        Q.   So again, you have 10,000 print ads at your

22   disposal and 37 in the book one ad, one ad on True,

23   right?

24       A.   That's right.

25       Q.   By the way, this is also the only ad that you 3459

1    selected for this jury to see that actually shows the

2   Surgeon General's warning in the ad, right?

3       A.   That's true.

4       Q.   Even though that warning would have appeared

5   in all print ads for cigarette products from '72

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=472
6   forward, right?

7       A.   For print ads, yeah, that's true.

8            MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor this would be

9       a good time to stop.

10            THE COURT: Okay. All right.

11             MR. WALKER: Thank you.

12            THE COURT: All right. Members of the jury,

13       we're going to take our lunch break. We'll be in

14       recess until 1:30. Please bear in mind my

15       instructions to keep an open mind and not to

16       communicate about this case amongst yourselves or

17       with anyone.

18            You will be in recess until 1:30.

19            (The jury retired from the courtroom at 12:06

20       p.m.)

21             THE COURT: Doctor, you obviously are on

22       cross-examination, so please do not discuss your

23       testimony with plaintiffs counsel, with any

24       counsel.

25            THE WITNESS: No problem. 3460

1            THE COURT: Okay, thank you. We'll be in

2       recess until 1:30.

3            MR. UITERWYK: One issue briefly, Your Honor.

4       He keeps showing this "What does this have to do

5       with Jackie Loyd?"

6            It's argumentative, is what it is. It's very

7       argumentative.

8            MR. WALKER: I will take it off.

9            THE COURT: Okay.

16                CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Cummings.

19       A.   Good afternoon.

20       Q.   Where we started off this morning, I sort of

21    followed up with you on this question that Mr. Uiterwyk

22   asked you, and we talked a little bit about that. He's

23   asked me to stop showing you that, so I'm going to put

24   that away for now. But I do want to ask you some more

25   questions about your book of ads. 3467

1        A.   Sure.

2       Q.   Actually, just one question. I looked

3   through all 37 ads, and I didn't see a single ad in the

4   book that you selected for this jury that said that

5   cigarette smoking is safe. Can you confirm for me that

6   that word "safe," "cigarette smoking is safe" does not

7   appear anywhere in the 37 ads you showed the jury?

8       A.   Yes. That was not in this ad. I think we

9   showed another ad called the Frank Statement. "Not

10   injurious to health" was the term.

11        Q.   Did you understand that I was asking you

12   about the Frank Statement or about this book of ads?

13       A.   This book of ads.

14       Q.   Okay. So you agree with me that there is no

15   ad in these 37 that you selected from your collection

16   of 10,000 that has the word "safe" in it anywhere,

17   correct?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=477
18       A.   Yes, sir.

19       Q.   Okay. Now, you also mentioned that you have

20   a collection of --1 wrote it down -- 600 television

21    advertisements.

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   Okay. And then from your collection of 600

24   television advertisements, you showed the jury five,

25   right? 3468

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   Does that sound about right to you?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   Okay. And one of those ads that you showed

5   was for a product that you know Jacqueline Loyd never

6   smoked, the Philip Morris brand cigarette products,

7   right?

8       A.   Well, we don't know one way or the other.

9       Q.   Okay.

10       A.   There is no testimony that she smoked

11    Philip Morris.

12       Q.   Let's be clear. I'm talking about the

13   commercial you showed with little Johnny who does the

14   call for Philip Morris. That was for Philip Morris

15   brand cigarettes, right?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   And you know from your review of this case

18   that not a single witness in this case testified that

19   Ms. Loyd actually smoked a brand of cigarettes called

20   Philip Morris, correct?

21        A.   That's true.

22       Q.   Okay. So that was one of the five. And then

23   you showed another two ads that ran on television

24   shows, right?

25       A.   That's right. 3469

1        Q.   One was for the Beverly Hillbillies?

2       A.   Correct.

3       Q.   The other one was the Flintstones?

4       A.   Correct.

5       Q.   And you know, just the same, that there is no

6   evidence in this case from anyone that Ms. Loyd was

7   watching either of those shows, is there?

8       A.   There is no evidence one way or the other.

9       Q.   Okay.

10       A.   They were popular shows.

11        Q.   Now, the next thing I want to ask you about

12   are a couple things that you mentioned today. And

13   these are press releases. You showed the jury --

14            Way zoomed out too far here.

15            You showed the jury this press release,

16   right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   Remember this one? This is Plaintiffs 2510.

19   And then a little bit before or a little bit after

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=478
20   that, you showed them this document, Plaintiffs 2583,

21    and you said this was a press release also, right?

22       A.   That's right.

23       Q.   Okay. Now, you know that not all -- that not

24   all press releases are actually picked up by the media;

25   is that right? 3470

1        A.   That's true.

2       Q.   Okay. And you didn't bring a single example

3   for either of those press releases of a newspaper story

4   or magazine article or anything of the kind in print,

5   black and white, that actually picked up either one of

6   these press releases, did you?

7       A.   I did not bring the coverage. I could.

8       Q.   Well, you didn't. The fact of the matter is

9   you didn't, right?

10       A.   I can certainly express that those both were

11    covered and did get picked up in the popular media.

12   The '81 was widely covered and the spokespeople

13   appeared on television shows. But I was just trying to

14   save time.

15       Q.   You can express that and you did express

16   that, right? You said all of that before, didn't you?

17       A.   No, I didn't comment on the TV coverage for

18   the'88 report.

19       Q.   Okay. Have you heard the expression trust

20   but verify?

21        A.   Sure.

22       Q.   Okay. Did you bring for this jury any

23   document, any newspaper article, any magazine article

24   that actually picked up the language from this press

25   release or this press release so that this jury could 3471

1   verify with their own eyes in black and white that

2   these press releases that you showed them actually ran

3   in some newspaper somewhere? Did you bring anything

4   like that?

5       A.   I did not bring that with me here. I have

6   got a TV clip, if you would like, on a flash drive for

7   the '88 report that states that from the two people who

8   were listed.

9       Q.   Okay. Now, let me ask you this. Did you

10   bring -- same question, but I want to make it a little

11   bit more narrow.

12       A.   Okay.

13       Q.   Did you bring a newspaper article for either

14   of these press releases from a newspaper that was

15   published in an area where Ms. Loyd lived? Do you have

16   that?

17       A.   No.

18       Q.   No. Okay. The same would be true if I asked

19   you that question for magazines, right? You don't have

20   any magazine that you brought that would allow this

21   jury to verify with their own eyes, instead of just

22   taking your word for it, that these press releases

23   actually ran in a magazine that Ms. Loyd might have

24   seen. Do you have that?

25       A.   Well, certainly, there are advertisements. I 3472

1    didn't present that to the jury, as you saw on direct.

2       Q.   Right. I'm not asking you about

3   advertisements. We covered that a little while ago.

4   What I'm now asking about are these press releases. If

5   this jury wants to verify with their own eyes with

6   black-and-white evidence that these press releases

7   actually ran in a magazine that Ms. Loyd might have

8   read, you didn't bring that with you, did you? You

9   don't have anything to show them right now?

10       A.   I certainly presented clippings of

11    advertisings of press releases that I brought.

12       Q.   These press releases, you have the newspaper

13   articles --

14       A.   I mentioned the TV coverage, because press

15   releases, since I have been in the business of doing

16   communications, often are intended to get you on the

17   news media. And the best news media to get on are

18   radio or television. So I explained to you, I can give

19   you --1 have the flash drive, if you would like me to

20   show it to you, the coverage with Brennan Moran and

21   Walker Merryman --

22       Q.   Right?

23       A.   -- commenting on the '88 report. There are

24   press clippings --1 haven't memorized every one --

25   that I do have that talk about other releases. I can't 3473

1    say specifically regarding the '72 one, but I believe

2   there are.

3       Q.   That was a much longer answer than I

4   expected. Did you understand that I was asking you

5   about TV, or was I asking you about black and white

6   newspaper or magazine articles where these press

7   releases ran?

8       A.   I thought I answered the question.

9       Q.   And the answer is you don't have it?

10       A.   I told you I didn't bring it along.

11        Q.   Thank you. Then you showed the jury a couple

12   of clips. Let's see. You had one that was a composite

13   clip of Ann Browder and other people saying different

14   things. Do you remember showing that?

15       A.   Sure, I do.

16       Q.   And then you mentioned that in that series of

17   clips, there was one of Mr. Horrigan speaking at a

18   congressional hearing, right?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   And that was what? 1982?

21        A.   That's right.

22       Q.   All right. And then later at the end there,

23   you showed a clip from what I will refer to as the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=480
24   Waxman hearings. You know what I'm talking about,

25   right? 3474

1        A.   That's right. Uh-huh (Indicates

2   affirmatively).

3       Q.   Okay. And that was 1994, right?

4       A.   That's right.

5       Q.   Now, you've been through the record in this

6   case, have you not?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   There is no evidence that Ms. Loyd saw either

9   of those congressional clips, is there?

10       A.   There is no evidence one way or the other.

11        Q.   Okay. And then by 1994, at the time of the

12   Waxman hearing clip you showed, the last one there, the

13   fact of the matter is Mrs. Loyd had already quit

14   smoking by that time, hadn't she?

15       A.   She wasn't smoking at that time, that's

16   right.

17       Q.   Okay. And after that testimony in 1994,

18   Ms. Loyd did not go back to cigarette smoking after

19   that, did she?

20       A.   No.

21        Q.   Okay. Next, I want to ask you about -- we

22   started talking about other ads. This was one of the

23   other ads that we showed the jury, right?

24       A.   That's right.

25       Q.   Okay. Can we have an open debate about 3475

1    smoking? And this exhibit that's going into evidence

2   says right at the top that this is from the New York

3   Times, right?

4       A.   True.

5       Q.   Okay. That's the same New York Times you

6   were referring to when we were going through some of

7   the advertisements, right?

8       A.   It's the New York Times newspaper.

9       Q.   The New York Times newspaper that --

10       A.   Yes. But the advertisements we were talking

11    about, the comic series, which was owned by the New

12   York-

13            THE COURT: No, no. Just answer the question

14       before you, please.

15            THE WITNESS: It wasn't the same. lean

16       explain if you would like.

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q.   Well, let me ask you this, because if it's

19   different, I guess I need to ask you again. There is

20   no evidence in this case that Ms. Loyd was ever reading

21    the New York Times newspaper, is there?

22       A.   No evidence one way or the other that she was

23   reading the New York Times.

24       Q.   Just to be clear, there is no evidence that

25   she ever saw this particular ad, wherever it might have

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=481
3476

1   run, is there?

2       A.   There is no evidence one way or the other. I

3   don't think people recall specific issue ads. I don't

4   think anybody who was deposed was actually shown this

5   ad.

6       Q.   All right. Now, you said that this ad --1

7   think you said that this ad might have run in Time and

8   Newsweek.

9       A.   Time, Newsweek. Popular, you know, magazines

10   as well.

11        Q.   And there is no evidence that Ms. Loyd was

12   reading Time or Newsweek either, is there?

13       A.   No.

14       Q.   All right. Then you said maybe -- maybe you

15   showed a clip with Ted Koppel?

16       A.   That's right. Nightline.

17       Q.   Nightline. No evidence Ms. Loyd was watching

18   Nightline either?

19       A.   No evidence one way or the other. I don't

20   think any family members ever asked -- were asked at

21    that time, that I recall.

22       Q.   Okay. Then you showed --1 shouldn't say

23   then, because I honestly don't remember the sequence of

24   these. But you showed this document. This is

25   Plaintiffs 718. Do you remember showing that one? 3477

1        A.   No.

2       Q.   You don't remember showing this document?

3       A.   No. But I'd be happy to talk to you about

4   it. I'm fully aware of it.

5       Q.   Okay.

6       A.   It's the Project Truth.

7       Q.   If you didn't show it, we don't need to talk

8   about it.

9       A.   No. That's all right. It's Project Truth,

10   Brown & Williamson.

11        Q.   Let's talk about this one, then. You did

12   show this document, did you not?

13       A.   I did.

14       Q.   This is Plaintiffs 3550. That one you did

15   show, right?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   Okay.

18       A.   This is the October 1964 BAT report.

19       Q.   I want to make sure I'm sticking to the right

20   ones now. You talked about BAT a few times now.

21    That's the British American Tobacco Company, right?

22       A.   Right. They were the parent organization for

23   Brown & Williamson.

24       Q.   And they were not an American tobacco

25   company, were they? 3478

1       A.   Brown & Williamson was, and they were the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=482
2   parent organization of -- they owned companies all over

3   the world.

4       Q.   I'm sorry. Do you understand that I am

5   asking you about the British American Tobacco Company?

6       A.   I am.

7       Q.   Okay. So my question is, was the British

8   American Tobacco Company a United States cigarette

9   manufacturer?

10       A.   They were. They owned Brown & Williamson.

11        Q.   You're saying that the British American

12   Tobacco Company was an American corporation?

13       A.   Saying they owned Brown & Williamson, which

14   was an American cigarette company.

15       Q.   Okay. Did you understand that I was asking

16   you about who they owned?

17       A.   I'm saying they manufactured cigarettes and

18   profited from the sale of those cigarettes here in the

19   United States.

20       Q.   Okay. I'm surprised -- okay. The British

21    American Tobacco Company is not an American company,

22   right?

23       A.   They're located in the UK.

24       Q.   Okay. Thank you.

25       A.   They own many different manufacturers. 3479

1        Q.   You're just going get that in there each

2   time, aren't you, whether I ask you about it or not?

3       A.   I guess so.

4       Q.   Okay.

5            THE COURT: Dr. Cummings, you need --

6       Dr. Cummings, you need to answer the question

7       directly if it calls for an answer that you can

8       answer directly with a yes or no.

9            THE WITNESS: Yes, Your Honor.

10   BY MR. WALKER:

11        Q.   So, Dr. Cummings, you said that this was a

12   document that was reporting on discussions that people

13   from the British American Tobacco Company had with

14   different people in the United States, right?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   Okay. I want to ask you about the sentence

17   that I don't think you read to the jury.

18       A.   Sure.

19       Q.   This is from the same document that you

20   showed the jury, if I can make it fit. Tell me if I

21    read this correctly.

22            This report may be clearer if we record at

23   the outset that Mr. Bowman Gray, parentheses, Reynolds;

24   Mr. Walker, parentheses, ATCO; and Mr. Finch,

25   parentheses, B&W, firmly and sincerely believe that it 3480

1   has not been proved that smoking is harmful to health.

2            Did I read that correctly?

3       A.   You did.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=483
4       Q.   And by the way, that Mr. Walker is no

5   relation to me, right?

6       A.   No.

7       Q.   Just a coincidence?

8       A.   Yes.

9       Q.   Okay. All right. Now, you spent quite a bit

10   of time talking about youth marketing. Remember that?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   And in connection with doing that, you said a

13   couple of times, Mr. Uiterwyk asked you a couple of

14   times that you're aware of 16 million documents that

15   have been collected relating to the tobacco companies'

16   documents, right?

17       A.   No, that's not what I said. I can explain

18   what I said with regards to the 16 million.

19       Q.   Sixteen million documents are collected

20   relating to the industry documents, right?

21        A.   No. Sixteen million pages of documents were

22   turned over to Roswell Park under my direction to scan

23   and digitize as part of the Council for Tobacco

24   Research and Tobacco Institute collections. That's

25   what the 16 million refers to. 3481

1        Q.   I thought you said there were 60 million

2   pages of documents.

3       A.   In total, there are 60 million pages of

4   materials, because the companies, as part of an

5   agreement, put up websites, each company, that had

6   documents as well. And we developed the searching

7   mechanisms -- they call it spidering -- across all of

8   those different websites. You could -- because they

9   each had different search technologies, so it wasn't --

10   you weren't able to search on a word the same way

11    across all the companies. So we developed the

12   searching methodology and actually copied those and

13   made those available on two websites: The

14   tobaccodocuments.org, which was the website that I ran,

15   and the University of California San Francisco Tobacco

16   Documents Digital Library is the other location.

17       Q.   So what's the right number? Sixteen million

18   pages or 16 million pages in terms of the documents at

19   your disposal that you had to choose from for what you

20   brought to show this jury?

21        A.   Well, the total is 60 million.

22       Q.   Sixty million?

23       A.   Yeah. And it's increasing, because there is

24   agreements that as new material is discovered, it's

25   supposed to be put up on the websites. 3482

1        Q.   Okay. So from 60 million pages of documents

2   on the issue of youth marketing, you brought, by my

3   count, ten. And we'll go through them. I want to ask

4   you about all ten of them.

5       A.   Sure.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=484
6       Q.   And you said, by the way, that you looked --

7   I think you said -- maybe you will tell me I'm wrong --

8   that you looked at every business document that relates

9   to the issue of youth marketing; is that right?

10       A.   Well, if I said "every," I mean, I don't know

11    what I haven't seen, so --

12            But I certainly did a very detailed

13   assessment of the topic of youth marketing as part of

14   an NIH grant and created a collection that included

15   some 2,500 or so documents, of which I have written

16   articles. I mentioned the issue of the Journal of

17   Tobacco Control that I edited and had several papers,

18   and myself as well as other academic researchers who

19   were published in that issue.

20       Q.   Okay. So 60 million pages of documents, and

21    you have your own personal collection of some 2,500 or

22   so documents?

23       A.   It's not a personal collection. You know,

24   when you do the research on a topic, you will go out

25   and use key words, just like going into a library to 3483

1   identify various, you know, things that might be in

2   publications in a library, and then you collect those.

3       Q.   And that's the 2,500 documents?

4       A.   I had about 2,500. We provided the access to

5   that website --

6       Q.   I'm not asking you who you provided --

7            THE COURT: Take the jury out, please.

8            (The jury retired from the courtroom at

9        1:51 p.m.)

10            THE COURT: We're not going to go through

11        this all afternoon. Counsel has a right to

12       cross-examine you. If the question is vague, if

13       you don't understand it, you could ask him that.

14       But if it's a question you can answer with a yes

15       or no, I expect you to answer that. You've

16       testified probably -- you've testified many times

17       before, I suspect. You're not new to this. Is

18       that right?

19            THE WITNESS: That's correct.

20            THE COURT: Okay. So let's not do this

21        again.

22            THE WITNESS: Okay.

23            THE COURT: Bring the jury back.

24            (The jury returned to the courtroom at

25        1:53 p.m.) 3484

1            THE COURT: Thank you. Be seated.

2            You may proceed.

3   BY MR. WALKER:

4       Q.   So, Dr. Cummings, we were talking about the

5   youth marketing documents that you showed this jury

6   from the collection of 2,500 that you referenced. And

7   I don't remember what order you went through them. I

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=485
8   put them in chronological order, and I want to ask you

9   about them.

10            The first is Plaintiffs 4015 in evidence --

11    if I can readjust this. Now, this was a letter that

12   you showed the jury, and it's dated 1926; is that

13   correct?

14       A.   Correct.

15       Q.   That would be nine years before Ms. Loyd was

16   born, right?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   And that would be -- and if you need to stop

19   and do math, that's okay -- but that would be about

20   25 years before she even started smoking, right?

21        A.   Correct.

22       Q.   Okay. The next document in this series that

23   you brought for this jury was another letter, right?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   This one is from June, it looks like 13, 3485

1    1928, right?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   So that would be seven years before Ms. Loyd

4   was born and 23 years before she started smoking?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   Okay. Now, you didn't bring any what I'm

7   calling youth marketing documents from the 1930s, did

8   you?

9       A.   No.

10       Q.   And none from the 1940s?

11        A.   Not dated 1940s, correct.

12       Q.   Okay. So the next one is, by my count, 1959.

13   December 9th, 1959, right?

14       A.   That's right.

15       Q.   By this time, Ms. Loyd is 24 years old,

16   right?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   And not only that, she's a smoker, right?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   She's been smoking for about eight years,

21    right?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   Okay. From 1959, we next go to 1973,

24   Plaintiffs 2275, Research planning memo on some

25   thoughts about new brands of cigarettes for the youth 3486

1   market, right?

2       A.   Right.

3       Q.   That was a Teague document you showed,

4   correct?

5       A.   Right.

6       Q.   By this time in 1973, Ms. Loyd is 38 years

7   old, right?

8       A.   That's right.

9       Q.   Okay. And you had another document from

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=486
10    1973. This is Plaintiff s 1233, right? December 4th,

11    1973?

12       A.   That's right.

13       Q.   She's still 38, right?

14       A.   Correct.

15       Q.   Okay. I will set that one to one side for a

16   moment.

17            The next document, we're now, I don't know,

18   five or six documents in to what you brought the jury

19   about youth marketing. You remember this document,

20   right?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   This is Plaintiffs 1641 that you showed the

23   jury, isn't it?

24       A.   That's right.

25       Q.   And this one is dated September 30th, 1974, 3487

1   right?

2       A.   That's right.

3       Q.   By this point Ms. Loyd was 39 years old,

4   correct?

5       A.   Correct.

6       Q.   Okay. Plaintiffs 1836. The number is

7   actually at the bottom. But you remember this

8   document, right?

9       A.   That's right.

10       Q.   This was a 1975 document, right?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   If I turn the page, you can actually see it

13   there. By 1975, Ms. Loyd was now 40 years old, right?

14       A.   Correct.

15       Q.   Continuing on in the youth marketing

16   documents you showed the jury, Plaintiffs 3578. You

17   remember showing them this document, right?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   This is teenage smokers 14 to 17 and new

20   adult -- new adult smokers and quitters. That was the

21    subject, right?

22       A.   That's right.

23       Q.   And this is October 29th, 1980, right?

24       A.   Correct.

25       Q.   By this time, Ms. Loyd is 45 years old, 3488

1   right?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   Okay. Set that one to one side. That was

4   the eighth youth marketing document you showed. This

5   is No. 9. This is, let's see, February 29th, 1984,

6   right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   For the record, this is Plaintiffs 3400.

9   This is a memorandum by Diane Burroughs, right?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   You spent quite a bit of time talking about

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=487
12   this document, didn't you?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   Okay. And at the time this document was

15   created, Ms. Loyd was 49 years old, was she not?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   Okay. And then just today, I think this is

18   the most recent one you showed, this is a letter from

19   January 11th, 1990, right?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Okay. You showed this one just today, didn't

22   you?

23       A.   I did.

24       Q.   All right. And in 1990, Ms. Loyd was now

25   55 years old, was she not? 3489

1        A.   That's right.

2       Q.   Okay. Now, I pulled out a couple of these.

3   These are some of the ones that, I don't know, it

4   appears to me that you talked about a little bit more

5   than some of the others. I want to go back to them. I

6   want to go back to this 1973 memo you showed the jury.

7   You know which one I'm talking about now, right?

8       A.   I do.

9       Q.   This Colby to Blevins, 1973, right?

10       A.   That's right.

11        Q.   Okay. Now, by the way, Frank Colby never

12   worked in the marketing department at Reynolds, did he?

13       A.   No, not in marketing.

14       Q.   Okay. There is no information that you've

15   ever seen to suggest that Reynolds ever implemented the

16   suggestions in this memo, is there?

17       A.   They did reformulate Winston.

18       Q.   That's not what I'm asking you. There is no

19   information that you've seen to suggest that RJR ever

20   implemented the suggestions made in this memo?

21        A.   That would be incorrect.

22       Q.   Okay. There is no evidence that Reynolds

23   ever introduced a retro cigarette in an effort to

24   appeal to youth, is there?

25       A.   They didn't use those terms. I would agree 3490

1   with that.

2       Q.   All right. Let's talk about Duffy. Let's

3   see. This is 3578. I just showed you this one. You

4   remember this one, right?

5       A.   I do.

6       Q.   Okay. Now, I want to focus on a part you

7   didn't read from when you showed this to the jury

8   earlier. I'm just going to read. If you can follow

9   along with the highlighted portion and tell me if I get

10   any part of this wrong. Okay?

11        A.   Sure.

12       Q.   For the past 15 years, RJR has used NFO for

13   product testing and regularly tracking adult smoker

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=488
14   profiles and switching information. The data regarding

15   teenagers, new smokers, and quitters is a natural

16   byproduct of the tracking of adult smokers. No special

17   effort is made to gather this data and it is not to be

18   used for marketing strategy purposes.

19            Did I read that correctly?

20       A.   You did.

21        Q.   All right. That's the first page. I want to

22   turn now to --1 don't know -- the third page in. This

23   is another section that the jury didn't see when you

24   were talking about this document, right? This

25   highlighted language, you didn't read earlier, did you? 3491

1        A.   No, we did not.

2       Q.   I'm going to read it now. You tell me if I

3   get it wrong.

4            Smoking behavior of 14-to-17-year-olds is

5   analyzed in order to improve our ability to forecast

6   trends. It is not designed to be used as a tool for

7   developing marketing strategies for this age group.

8            Did I read that correctly?

9       A.   You did.

10       Q.   All right. Let's have a look, then, at the

11    Burroughs document. This is Plaintiffs 3400. We

12   looked at it a couple seconds ago. This is the one

13   from 1984, right?

14       A.   That's right.

15       Q.   Okay. Let's go to the -- just the first

16   page. Let me start there. And I'm going to -- it's a

17   thick document. I'm going to have to take it apart

18   here.

19            Let's see. Right there on the first page,

20   first paragraph, do you see there that the term

21    "younger adult smokers" is defined as 18 to 24?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   Okay. And the truth is, you know from having

24   looked at this document that younger adult smokers is

25   referred to as 18 to 24 more than 200 times in this 3492

1    document alone, right?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   All right. Let's turn to page 8. Okay.

4   Right at the top there under Introduction, I'll read.

5   You tell me if I get it right -- if I get it wrong.

6            RJR's consistent policy is that smoking is a

7   matter of free, informed adult choice which the company

8   does not seek to influence.

9            Did I read that right?

10       A.   You did.

11        Q.   All right. And then the next highlighted

12   part there says, Furthermore, if we are to compete

13   effectively, we must recognize the imperative to know

14   and meet the wants of those who are 18 and have already

15   elected to smoke, as well as those of older smokers.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=489
16            Did I read that right?

17       A.   You read it correctly.

18       Q.   Okay. I'm turning now to the 21st page of

19   this document. And, again, that's document --

20            MR. UITERWYK: Excuse me. Is that Bates

21        stamped?

22            MR. WALKER: Bates 21.

23   BY MR. WALKER:

24       Q.   And that has more references to 18-year-old

25   smokers, right? 3493

1        A.   The 18-year-olds' share. I can explain what

2   that means if you would like.

3       Q.   No. I'm just asking you if this page has

4   more references to 18-year-old smokers.

5       A.   It does.

6       Q.   Okay. You just offered to explain it, but

7   first let me ask you, this here right where my finger

8   is in this chart, the dotted line, it says 18-year-old

9   share, right?

10       A.   That's right.

11        Q.   Okay. Now, one more. I want to turn now to

12   Bates 65. This is a chart that you showed the jury.

13   And you talked about some of the numbers in this area,

14   right?

15       A.   What page is this?

16       Q.   This is the 65th page. This is appendix B.

17       A.   Okay.

18       Q.   All right. Are you with me?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   All right. Now, the data that's collected

21    here, you can see -- and I think you'll agree with

22   me -- that data is from the federal government; is that

23   right?

24       A.   Health, Education and Welfare, HEW.

25       Q.   HEW is Health, Education and Welfare. In 3494

1   fact, that's now what would be called Health and Human

2   Services, right?

3       A.   That's right.

4       Q.   Okay. That's publicly available data, is it

5   not?

6       A.   It is.

7       Q.   And so the surveys that are reflected in this

8   information on this page, that's -- those are not

9   surveys that were conducted by Reynolds?

10       A.   No.

11        Q.   They're surveys that were conducted by the

12   federal government?

13       A.   Correct.

14       Q.   Okay. Let's see if I can reassemble this and

15   move on to the next one.

16            All right. Let's go back to this letter from

17    1990, when Mrs. Loyd was 55 years old. Do you know the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=490
18   one I'm talking about?

19       A.   I do.

20       Q.   Now, let's be clear. Mrs. Loyd was not

21    living in Amherst, New York, was she?

22       A.   No.

23       Q.   She wasn't in fifth grade?

24       A.   No.

25       Q.   She wasn't even in elementary school? 3495

1        A.   No.

2       Q.   She had no --

3       A.   Obviously.

4       Q.   -- no connection at all with the Willow Ridge

5   School, did she?

6       A.   No.

7       Q.   Okay. And there is no evidence in this case

8   that Mrs. Loyd ever saw this letter, is there?

9       A.   No.

10       Q.   In fact, there is no evidence in this case

11    that Mrs. Loyd ever saw a letter even like this, is

12   there?

13       A.   There is no evidence one way or the other.

14       Q.   All right. Now, you talked about sort of the

15   role that you played in the creation of this letter,

16   the circumstances that led to this letter, right?

17       A.   Yes, I did.

18       Q.   Okay. And you said that, in fact, you were

19   the one who encouraged these students to write Reynolds

20   in the first place, right?

21        A.   That's right.

22       Q.   Now, I want to make sure that -- because you

23   said a few things about this. I want to make sure

24   we're clear. Reynolds did not respond directly to the

25   students, did it? 3496

1        A.   No. The letter is addressed to the

2   principal.

3       Q.   The letter is addressed to the principal and

4   it was left up to the principal whether or not to share

5   this letter with the students, right?

6       A.   True.

7       Q.   And, in fact, you know that this letter was

8   not shared with the students, right?

9       A.   Yes, it was.

10       Q.   It was?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   You remember testifying that it wasn't?

13       A.   Well, it was -- at a certain point of time it

14   was shared with the students.

15       Q.   Haven't you testified that this letter was

16   not shared with students?

17       A.   I'm not sure which students you're referring

18   to.

19       Q.   You're not sure which students I'm referring

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=491
20   to?

21        A.   Right.

22       Q.   I'm referring to the students at Willow Ridge

23   School.

24       A.   The students at Willow Ridge School

25   participated --1 can explain if you would like. 3497

1        Q.   First I just want to understand if you're now

2   testifying that this letter was shared with students at

3   Willow Ridge School.

4       A.   It was at one time. I can explain if you

5   would like.

6       Q.   We'll come back to it.

7            All right. Now, by the way, the highlighted

8   part there, The tobacco industry considers smoking to

9   be a custom for those adults who derive pleasure from

10   it, right?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Okay. Incidentally, once you received a copy

13   of this particular letter, that's when it started

14   making the rounds in litigation, cases like this,

15   right?

16            MR. UITERWYK: Objection, Your Honor.

17       Relevance, argumentative.

18            THE COURT: Overruled.

19            THE WITNESS: No.

20   BY MR. WALKER:

21        Q.   No?

22       A.   I found the letter. I did share it with

23   others, because I was alarmed by it.

24       Q.   And you --

25       A.   I wasn't involved in litigation in 1990. 3498

1        Q.   But in cases where you testify, this letter

2   that you were involved in the back story now gets used,

3   right?

4       A.   Sure.

5       Q.   Okay.

6       A.   It's relevant.

7       Q.   Okay. By the way, you mentioned that you've

8   seen other letters like this. You don't have a letter

9   to show this jury that it went to any school in

10   Florida, do you?

11        A.   Not with me, no.

12       Q.   And you don't have any letter that's

13   connected to any school that Mrs. Loyd was connected

14   with in any way, do you?

15       A.   No.

16       Q.   All right. All right. We can turn this off

17   for now.

18            Let me ask you. You've described yourself as

19   an anti-tobacco advocate, right?

20       A.   That's correct.

21        Q.   And, in fact, you even wrote an article

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=492
22   entitled The War On Tobacco, right?

23       A.   Yes.

24       Q.   And that's because you believe you're in a

25   war against tobacco companies, right? 3499

1        A.   I guess you could describe it that way. I

2   wouldn't use that term. I wrote that article for the

3   Journal of Cancer.

4       Q.   You could describe it that way, and you could

5   be described as a mercenary in that war, could you not?

6       A.   Well, some people have described me that way.

7       Q.   Okay. You charge $200 an hour for the time

8   you spend reviewing documents and depositions and

9   underlying materials?

10       A.   Today I do.

11        Q.   And you charge $500 an hour for testimony,

12   whether it's at a trial like this or a deposition,

13   right?

14       A.   That's right. Today I do.

15       Q.   That works out to -- if it's an eight-hour

16   day, that works out to $4,000 a day, right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   All right. And today -- we did this earlier

19   and I think I got it wrong. Today is actually your

20   third day of testimony, not your fourth day; is that

21    right?

22       A.   That's right.

23       Q.   Okay. So you earned somewhere in the

24   neighborhood of $4,000 on Wednesday, right?

25       A.   No. 3500

1        Q.   No. What was -- what did you get for

2   Wednesday?

3       A.   I only charge for the time I'm sitting in

4   this seat speaking to the jury.

5       Q.   What's the number, sir?

6       A.   I haven't actually added it up. I will add

7   it up when it's done.

8       Q.   Okay. What about on Thursday? What's the

9   number for Thursday?

10       A.   Again, I haven't added it up. Most of

11    Thursday was spent sitting in the hallway.

12       Q.   Ballpark it for me. Three thousand?

13   Thirty- five hundred ?

14       A.   I would rather not.

15       Q.   You'd rather not?

16       A.   I'd rather not ballpark it for you.

17       Q.   Okay. What about Friday? How much did you

18   make on Friday testifying here?

19       A.   Again, I haven't calculated the numbers, so I

20   would have to go back. But, you know, $500 an hour

21    when I'm sitting in the chair answering questions.

22       Q.   You would rather not ballpark Friday for me?

23       A.   I haven't gone back to really think about it.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=493
24       Q.   Two thousand dollars, 2,500, 3,000? Give us

25   an idea. 3501

1        A.   It might be in that range.

2       Q.   In that range?

3       A.   Yeah.

4       Q.   So just from Wednesday to today, how much

5   would you say your bill is going to be, just ballpark?

6       A.   I really haven't added it up. It's 

7       Q.   Over $10,000, right?

8       A.   It may be, yeah.

9       Q.   Do you have any doubt that it's over 10,000?

10       A.   No. I mean, I don't know how long you're

11    going to be questioning me, so I don't really know.

12       Q.   I just mean up to this point. You don't

13   think you've got $10,000 in at this point?

14       A.   I don't know. Half of that goes to the

15   foundation I have set up.

16       Q.   It's your bill, though, right? You send the

17   bill, right?

18       A.   That's right, sure.

19       Q.   And if you bill $10,000, you then at some

20   point get a check for $10,000, right?

21        A.   That's right.

22       Q.   The check for the whole $10,000 comes to you,

23   right?

24       A.   That's right.

25       Q.   And then like all people who receive checks, 3502

1   you decide what to do with the money at that point,

2   right?

3       A.   That's true.

4       Q.   Okay. Now, you've testified in

5   tobacco-related lawsuits for over 16 years?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   And you've testified in cases against tobacco

8   companies more than 50 times, haven't you?

9       A.   Yes, I have.

10       Q.   Okay. Even if we look back just to the

11   beginning of 2010, just since 2010 you've testified

12   live in 40 trials like this, right?

13       A.   That's probably accurate.

14       Q.   Eleven trials just in 2010, right?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   Twelve times in 2011?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   Sixteen times last year?

19       A.   I think that's an overestimate for last year.

20       Q.   What would sound better to you? Fourteen,

21    15, 13? What?

22       A.   I think 13.

23       Q.   Thirteen.

24       A.   Is what I count.

25       Q.   Okay. All right. Now, let's see. You

	A.
	Okay.

7
	Q.
	By the way, Mack 2, that was with some of

8
	these
	same lawyers, right?

9
	A.
	That's right.

10
	Q.
	So it is 16 times, right?

11
	A.
	You keep track of it better than I do.

12
	Q.
	Well, I've got the list here. It's more than

13
	you can keep up with in your mind, right?
	
14
	A.
	It's a lot of trials. That's true.

15
	Q.
	Okay. Now --

16
	A.
	I keep up with each one, though.

17
	Q.
	I'm sorry?

18
	A.
	I keep up with each one.

19
	Q.
	Okay. This is your first trial of this year,

20
	right?
	
21
	A.
	It is.

22
	Q.
	But it won't be your last, will it?

23
	A.
	No.

24
	Q.
	No. In fact, as soon as you finish here,

25
	you're going down to Ft. Myers for another $500 an
	
3505
		

1
	hour,
	right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=495
2       A.   I'm going down to testify in another case,

3   yes.

4       Q.   And when you testify in this case, you will

5   be paid $500 an hour?

6       A.   That's right.

7       Q.   Okay. In fact, you've testified that

8   testifying against cigarette companies is almost a

9   second job for you?

10       A.   I have said that.

11        Q.   You've been paid over $450,000 just since the

12   beginning of 2009 in litigation against tobacco

13   companies, right?

14       A.   I don't dispute that.

15       Q.   More than $225,000 in 2011 alone?

16       A.   I don't dispute it. I haven't really added

17   it up.

18       Q.   Sounds right, though, doesn't it?

19       A.   Yeah.

20       Q.   Okay.

21        A.   It's a lot of cases.

22       Q.   Now, that's in addition to whatever salary

23   you get in South Carolina, right?

24       A.   That's right.

25       Q.   That's also in addition to whatever your 3506

1   pension is from Roswell Park?

2       A.   That's correct.

3       Q.   Okay. Now, if we were just looking at 2011,

4   you've estimated that your litigation work was

5   somewhere around 60 percent of your total income from

6   all sources; is that right?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   And that would be true for 2012 also, right?

9       A.   Probably, yes.

10       Q.   Last year you testified that you personally

11    had grossed -- grossed -- more than $700,000 working as

12   an expert against tobacco companies?

13       A.   Since 1996, correct.

14       Q.   Okay.

15       A.   So in total.

16       Q.   And you believed at that time, in the Hancock

17   case, you believed that you would hit -- you might hit

18   a million dollars total testifying against tobacco

19   companies by the end of last year, right?

20       A.   I said I might. I didn't know.

21        Q.   Did you? Did you hit a million dollars last

22   year?

23       A.   No.

24       Q.   Okay. How close did you come?

25       A.   I haven't added it up. 3507

1        Q.   Okay. Now, you've also participated in

2   conferences to help plaintiffs lawyers like these

3   develop strategies for suing cigarette companies,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=496
4   right?

5       A.   Well, I've given lectures to the lawyers.

6   That's true.

7       Q.   You've given lectures to lawyers at

8   conferences where plaintiffs lawyers are developing

9   strategies for suing cigarette companies?

10       A.   Yes, sir.

11        Q.   Okay. One of those was in Boston in 2002,

12   right?

13       A.   It was.

14       Q.   That was a conference that was devoted to

15   litigation strategy in tobacco cases?

16       A.   That was run by The Tobacco Product Liability

17   Group, and yes.

18       Q.   The conference was called, How to win a just

19   tobacco verdict, right?

20       A.   That's right.

21        Q.   And just -- a just verdict means a verdict

22   for plaintiffs that hire you, right?

23       A.   I didn't plan the conference, but I believe

24   that, yes.

25       Q.   Yeah. One agenda item at that conference 3508

1   that you spoke at was the keys to giant verdicts,

2   right?

3       A.   That was somebody's talk. That wasn't mine.

4       Q.   That wasn't your talk?

5       A.   No.

6       Q.   Okay. But you encountered a number of

7   plaintiffs lawyers who later hired you as a witness

8   for them in their smoker cases, right?

9       A.   Sure. They became aware of the archive.

10   Yeah, that's true.

11        Q.   Now, you say you weren't the speaker on that

12   one, but you were a speaker at that conference, right?

13       A.   I gave two talks.

14       Q.   Two talks. And for somebody to have seen the

15   talks that you gave at that conference, to even attend

16   it at all, you had to sign an affidavit saying that you

17   would never work for a tobacco company; is that right?

18       A.   They did. The sponsors did require people to

19   sign affidavits that they didn't work for cigarette

20   companies.

21        Q.   And you signed one of those affidavits,

22   right? Saying that you would never work for a tobacco

23   company, in order to participate in that conference?

24       A.   I signed the affidavit that says I don't --

25   at the time I didn't work for a cigarette company, no. 3509

1        Q.   All right. Now, you've been asked before,

2   and you're usually frank about this, that you have a

3   significant bias against tobacco companies, don't you?

4       A.   Sure, given what I know.

5       Q.   No question about that, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=497
6       A.   Absolutely. Based on my training and

7   experience, I have developed that bias.

8       Q.   Well, whatever the reason, when you testify,

9   you want the plaintiff in the case to win, don't you?

10       A.   I testify, and that's what I do. But if I

11    think -- and if you want my opinion, I'll be happy to

12   give you my opinion --

13       Q.   When you --

14       A.   --that the plaintiff should win.

15       Q.   I'm sorry. When you testify, you want the

16   plaintiff in the case to win the case, right?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   Okay. In fact, you've said in past cases

19   that you're rooting for the plaintiffs to win cases

20   like this, right?

21        A.   I have been asked, Are you rooting, and I

22   said yes. I don't walk away from that.

23       Q.   And so you're not walking away either from

24   the fact that you're rooting for Ms. Evers to win this

25   case, right? 3510

1        A.   Based on the facts that I reviewed, yes.

2       Q.   All right. Now, we went through just a

3   little bit of what you showed the jury in terms of

4   advertisements. And you talked about advertising and

5   marketing in your direct, right?

6       A.   I did.

7       Q.   Okay. But to be clear, you don't have any

8   kind of formal degree in advertising, do you?

9       A.   I have a degree in health communications.

10       Q.   Okay. But I'm asking you if you have a

11    formal degree in advertising.

12       A.   I'm just clarifying. I don't have a -- my

13   official degree is not in advertising.

14       Q.   Okay. And -

15       A.   Health behavior.

16       Q.   So the same question. You don't have an

17   official degree in marketing, do you?

18       A.   No, I do not have an official degree in

19   marketing.

20       Q.   You've never worked in an advertising agency?

21        A.   I have never worked in an advertising agency.

22   I have always been a scientist.

23       Q.   You've never worked for a marketing company?

24       A.   No. Hired them but not worked for them.

25       Q.   You've never worked in marketing for any 3511

1    consumer products company, have you?

2       A.   True.

3       Q.   Now, you talked about this idea of the

4   wallpaper effect. Do you remember giving that

5   testimony?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   And that's the idea --1 won't say it the way

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=498
8   you did precisely, but that's the idea --

9            Actually, let me just ask you a different

10   question in connection with your testimony about the

11    wallpaper effect. Everyone has seen advertisements for

12   cigarettes. Is that -- would you agree with that?

13       A.   Hard to escape it.

14       Q.   Okay.

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   And you showed advertisements from

17   magazines --

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.    according to you, right?

20       A.   That's right.

21        Q.   You showed magazines that you say ran in

22   newspapers?

23       A.   Magazines that ran in newspapers?

24       Q.   Did I say "magazines"?

25       A.   Yes, you did. 3512

1        Q.   I didn't mean to say that.

2            You showed advertisements that you say ran in

3   newspapers, right?

4       A.   That's right.

5       Q.   Okay. And you showed advertisements that you

6   say ran on television, right?

7       A.   Correct.

8       Q.   Okay. But you know from your review of this

9   case that the plaintiff in this case, Cindy Evers,

10   testified that her mother, Mrs. Loyd, didn't watch a

11    lot of TV. You saw that, didn't you?

12       A.   I did.

13       Q.   Okay. You know that Ms. Evers couldn't

14   recall her mother ever subscribing to any newspapers,

15   right?

16       A.   I do recall that.

17       Q.   You remember reading that Ms. Evers doesn't

18   recall her mother ever regularly reading newspapers,

19   right?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   And the testimony that you saw was that she

22   didn't like to read newspapers. You saw that in

23   Ms. Evers' deposition, didn't you?

24       A.   I recall reading the statements in the

25   deposition. 3513

1        Q.   In fact, the plaintiff in this case,

2   Ms. Evers, testified that the only magazines her mother

3   subscribed to were livestock magazines; isn't that

4   right?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   And you didn't bring anything from any

7   livestock magazine, did you?

8       A.   No.

9       Q.   You didn't even research livestock magazines?

10       A.   Sorry, I did not.

11        Q.   Okay. Now, tell me if I have this right.

12   Isn't it true that millions and millions and millions

13   of people who have seen advertisements for cigarettes

14   nevertheless have been lifelong nonsmokers?

15       A.   Sure.

16       Q.   And you would agree with me that 60 million

17   people have quit smoking, right?

18       A.   Yes. As of today.

19       Q.   Well, those are the same 60 million people

20   that would have been exposed to all the advertising

21    campaigns or at least some of them that you described,

22   right?

23       A.   I think everybody has been exposed, but --

24       Q.   Even the 60 million people who quit smoking?

25       A.   Sure. 3514

1        Q.   Okay. Now, with respect to first picking up

2   a cigarette, what you called uptake?

3       A.   That's right.

4       Q.   Okay. The most important factor is actually

5   whether a person's friends and family members smoke,

6   right?

7       A.   Peer pressure is an important factor, yes.

8       Q.   You've stated not that -- not just that it's

9   important but that it's the single most important

10   factor that leads underage people to start smoking,

11   period?

12       A.   First experimentation, yes, I agree with

13   that.

14       Q.   Smoking by a teen's friends make it more

15   likely that a teen will start smoking, right?

16       A.   Absolutely.

17       Q.   And you know from your review of the

18   depositions that Mrs. Loyd began smoking because her

19   friends were smoking, right?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   The story for Ms. Evers was that she snuck

22   down to a park with two other friends, right?

23            MR. UITERWYK: Objection. Hearsay, Your

24       Honor.

25            THE COURT: Sustained. 3515

1            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, it's an admission

2       per Your Honor's prior rulings.

3            THE COURT: All right. Approach, please.

4            (At the bench)

5            THE COURT: Explain that to me.

6            MR. WALKER: It's Ms. Evers's testimony I'm

7       asking about. She's a party opponent. It's not

8       hearsay. It's within an exception because it's an

9       admission of a party opponent being used against

10       the party who made the statement.

11             MR. UITERWYK: It's not her admission.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=500
12            MR. WALKER: It's in her deposition.

13            MR. UITERWYK: It's not her admission. She

14       just simply said what her mother said. That's

15       still hearsay.

16            MR. WALKER: And Your Honor ruled what the

17       decedent said is also an admission by a party

18       opponent, because she's in privity with Ms. Evers.

19            THE COURT: Are you saying both party

20       opponents? Wouldn't it be one or the other?

21       Wouldn't it be just Mrs. Loyd as the party

22       opponent? I think that was -- the point that

23       Mr. Pedrosa made when we had this discussion a few

24       days ago, that it was an admission of a party

25       opponent. That would be Mrs. Loyd. I mean --3516

1            MR. WALKER: Whether it's Mrs. Loyd or

2       Ms. Evers, it's still within an exception, either

3       way.

4            MR. PEDROSA: My argument, Judge, was that

5       they are both party opponents under the rule.

6       Even if they aren't both party opponents, the rule

7       is not so narrow. The rule is a party or someone

8       closely associated with the party. So whether you

9       consider the decedent formally a party or just

10       closely associated with the plaintiff, the point

11        is they both come in under the rule of admissions

12       of a party opponent.

13            THE COURT: The only way the -- Ms. Evers

14       would know would be based upon what the mother

15       told her.

16            MR. WALKER: Which is not hearsay.

17            THE COURT: Well, that's probably true.

18            MR. UITERWYK: You're saying -- you're saying

19       it's an admission. He's saying --1 assume he's

20       saying it's an admission against interest. I

21        don't know how it could be.

22            MR. WALKER: No. It's an admission of a

23       party opponent.

24            MR. UITERWYK: I don't -

25            THE COURT: Okay. I will allow it. 3517

1             (In open court)

2   BY MR. WALKER:

3       Q.   Dr. Cummings, I bet you forgot my question,

4   because I have, so I'm going to ask it again.

5            You know from your review of the deposition

6   testimony that Ms. Evers -- Mrs. Loyd snuck down to a

7   park with two of her friends, right?

8       A.   I remember in the depositions the age that

9   she started, and it was with friends. But that is

10   about it.

11        Q.   So you don't remember the testimony I'm

12   referring to?

13       A.   No, I don't.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=501
14       Q.   Okay. Now, you know from your review --

15            Well, let me ask you. You said that you

16   reviewed about a dozen depositions, right?

17       A.   Over a dozen.

18       Q.   Over a dozen?

19       A.   Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively).

20       Q.   Okay. And we've already discussed that

21    Ms. Evers' deposition was one of those that you

22   reviewed, right?

23       A.   There were two volumes. Correct.

24       Q.   Okay.

25       A.   One I reviewed in 2009 and the other more 3518

1   recently.

2       Q.   How much more recently, by the way?

3       A.   I received the depositions probably the fall

4   of this year.

5       Q.   Can't be the fall of this year.

6       A.   Or the fall of last year -- I'm sorry --of

7   2012.

8       Q.   Okay. All right. And that would be true for

9   the other --

10            In 2009, you only had two, right?

11        A.   That's right.

12       Q.   All right. So-

13       A.   Plus the medical records.

14       Q.   All of the other ones you received in the

15   fall?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   Did you ask for them?

18       A.   Yeah.

19       Q.   Okay. Why did you ask for them?

20       A.   Because I knew the case was being scheduled,

21    and I asked to see everything that I had seen

22   originally, because it was 2009 when I did the original

23   deposition.

24       Q.   Okay. So one of the depositions that you

25   reviewed just last fall was the deposition of Jack 3519

1    Smith, right?

2       A.   That's right.

3       Q.   Okay. And by the way, you -- the reason you

4   were asking for all of those depositions was so that

5   you would have that information in giving your

6   opinions, right?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   Okay.

9       A.   Well, it was to see whether it would change

10   my opinions that I gave originally in that -- the

11    original deposition.

12       Q.   Okay. So you know from your review of the

13   records that, growing up, Mrs. Loyd's family did not

14   agree with smoking. You know that, right?

15       A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=502
16       Q.   You know that from the time Mr. Smith and

17   Mrs. Loyd were children, smoking was not allowed in

18   their house, right?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   You know that the high school that she

21    attended did not allow smoking, right?

22       A.   I'm not aware of that.

23       Q.   You don't remember reading that in Jack's

24   deposition?

25       A.   No. 3520

1        Q.   All right. You're not disagreeing with me

2   that it's there, you just don't remember it?

3       A.   I don't remember it.

4       Q.   Okay. You saw that Mr. Smith and

5   Mrs. Loyd -- they're brother and sister, right?

6       A.   Uh-huh (Indicates affirmatively). That's

7   right.

8       Q.   You know from your review of the case that

9   they actually hid their smoking from their parents,

10   right?

11        A.   That's right.

12       Q.   And even as adults, you know from your review

13   of the case that Ms. Evers refrained from smoking in

14   her parents' home, right?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   Now, you showed the jury some advertisements

17   with celebrities in them, right?

18       A.   That's right.

19       Q.   All right. Celebrities were used to

20   advertise lots of products from the 1950s, right?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   Not just cigarettes?

23       A.   Not just cigarettes.

24       Q.   Even today we see the use of celebrities and

25   movie stars in advertisements, don't we? 3521

1        A.   Sure do.

2       Q.   For example, the Snickers ads with Betty

3   White?

4       A.   That's right.

5       Q.   The Weight Watchers ads with Jennifer Hudson?

6   You've seen those, haven't you?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Charles Barkley? You've seen those?

9       A.   That's right.

10       Q.   Okay. Now, you also showed the jury a number

11    of ads that you said had military themes or holiday

12   themes, endorsements by athletes. Do you remember that

13   testimony?

14       A.   I remember talking about the holiday themes

15   and the athletes.

16       Q.   The holiday and the athletes. That's right.

17   Those were popular ad themes at that time, weren't

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=503
18   they?

19       A.   Still are.

20       Q.   None of the themes that you showed in the ads

21    were actually unique to cigarette products in the

22    1950s, were they?

23       A.   No, I wouldn't say they were unique.

24       Q.   Now, up until 1971 there was -- it was legal

25   for a company to buy advertising time on TV, right? 3522

1        A.   For cigarettes?

2       Q.   For cigarettes.

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   Yes. Okay. And up until 71, it was legal

5   for a cigarette company to run an ad on TV, right?

6       A.   That's right.

7       Q.   Okay. And then after 1971, the law changed,

8   right?

9       A.   The law changed in 1969. It went into effect

10   in 1971.

11        Q.   Okay. Fair enough. And then there was no

12   more cigarette advertising on TV after 1971, was there?

13       A.   Correct.

14       Q.   And the same would be true for radio, right?

15       A.   True.

16       Q.   Okay. And then starting in 1972, the Surgeon

17   General's warnings that we saw on at least one of the

18   ads that you brought went onto all cigarette

19   advertisements, right?

20       A.   That's right.

21        Q.   Okay. Now, you showed the jury some ads

22   called "more doctors smoke Camels." Do you remember

23   that?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   You know that in 1994, the Surgeon General 3523

1    concluded that the advertisements like "more doctors

2   smoke Camels" actually backfired and reminded smokers

3   of the health risks of smoking, right?

4       A.   Well, there is a reference to that.

5       Q.   You saw that reference, right?

6       A.   I don't -- that was not a conclusion of the

7   Surgeon General's report in 1994.

8       Q.   Didn't -- didn't the Surgeon General in 1994

9   conclude -- conclude that ads in the 1950s, such as ads

10   about filters, throat irritation, more doctors smoke

11    Camels, etc., actually increased consumer awareness of

12   the health risks of smoking?

13       A.   I don't think that was the conclusion. They

14   did -- there was a reference to it, and certainly they

15   did mention that. I remember a citation in the report.

16       Q.   Haven't you testified that in 1994, the

17   Surgeon General made that conclusion?

18       A.   I don't know if I have -- if I was asked

19   about it as a conclusion. It was not a conclusion. I

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=504
20   have testified that I am aware of the reference in the

21    report where there is a sentence that talks about that.

22       Q.   Okay. You remember giving testimony in the

23   Webb trial, don't you?

24       A.   Sure.

25       Q.   That was in 2010? 3524

1        A.   That's right.

2       Q.   Okay. And you were sitting in a witness box

3   then just like you are now, right?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   And before you started, you raised your right

6   hand and you were placed under oath?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   And there was a court reporter there just

9   like -- maybe not just like, but similar to the court

10   reporters that we have here, right?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Okay. I'm going to give you a copy of your

13   testimony from the Webb case on this very topic.

14       A.   Okay.

15            MR. UITERWYK: Can you provide a copy?

16            MR. WALKER: Yes.

17            MR. UITERWYK: I didn't know if you were

18       going to provide me a copy.

19            MR. WALKER: Yes, I am.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Thank you.

21    BY MR. WALKER:

22       Q.   I'm going to put it on the ELMO, but would

23   you like a copy?

24       A.   Yes, I would.

25            MR. WALKER: How about this ? May I approach, 3525

1        Your Honor?

2            THE COURT: Yes.

3            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

4   BY MR. WALKER:

5       Q.   You take my copy, and I'll put it on the

6   screen. This is page 1195 of your testimony at the

7   trial of Webb on November 5th, 2010.

8            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I don't believe

9       that's proper impeachment, to put it on the

10       screen. He's not even established that it's --

11             THE COURT: Overruled.

12            MR. UITERWYK: -- an inconsistent statement.

13   BY MR. WALKER:

14       Q.   We'll start at line 5. This is the question

15   and answer. Okay?

16       A.   Okay.

17       Q.   Question: And with regard to the company

18   response, that they thought their advertising was

19   actually causing more of a health problem or concern,

20   it's true, isn't it, that in 1994 the Surgeon General

21    concluded that ads in the 1950s such as ads about

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=505
22   filters, throat irritation, more doctors smoke Camels,

23   etc., actually increased consumer awareness of the

24   health risks of smoking?

25            Do you see that? 3526

1        A.   Correct.

2       Q.   And then the first thing out of your mouth in

3   answer to that question was "That's true," right?

4       A.   That's what I said.

5       Q.   And then you go on to talk about some of the

6   reasons that you believe there were for the dip in

7   sales, right?

8       A.   That's right.

9       Q.   Okay.

10       A.   I was clarifying. It wasn't a conclusion.

11        Q.   Maybe just hold onto that.

12       A.   Sure.

13       Q.   Now, we were talking about the 1994 Surgeon

14   General's report. You were actually a contributor to

15   that report, weren't you?

16       A.   I was.

17       Q.   Okay. Let's take a look at, then, what the

18   Surgeon General actually said about this. This is

19   page 171 of the Surgeon General's report, 1994. And

20   let's zoom in, if we could, on the highlighted

21    language.

22            You said there was a reference in this

23   report -- let's see if we are talking about the same

24   thing.

25            With greater public concern about cancer, 3527

1   however, these continuing health claims, although

2   intended to reassure consumers, were likely increasing

3   consumer awareness of the suspected health risks of

4   smoking.

5            Do you see that?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   That's the reference you were talking about,

8   right?

9       A.   Correct.

10       Q.   Okay. All right. Now, I want to ask you --

11    one of the ads that you showed the jury was from the

12   Flintstones. Remember that?

13       A.   Yes, I do.

14       Q.   That was at the end of the day. What was

15   that? Thursday?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   Okay. That was an ad that was from 1960,

18   right?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   And Mrs. Loyd would have been 25 years old in

21    1960, right?

22       A.   That's right.

23       Q.   Okay. And she had already been smoking

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=506
24   Winston before that time, right?

25       A.   Yes. 3528

1        Q.   Okay. You can agree with me that there is no

2   evidence that you saw in the record that Mrs. Loyd was

3   ever watching the Flintstones, is there?

4       A.   No. There is no evidence one way or the

5   other.

6       Q.   All right. And the Flintstones was not a

7   Saturday morning cartoon when it premiered, right?

8       A.   No.

9       Q.   Let's take a look at the New York Times from

10   September 30th, 1960. That was the day that the

11    Flintstones premiered. Let's just zoom in, if we can,

12   on the highlighted portion there. You tell me if I've

13   got this right.

14            Flintstones, tonight: The first, the

15   freshest, the funniest comedy of its kind. An adult

16   comedy in cartoon form relating to very modern muddles

17   of some very prehistoric neighbors.

18            Did I read that right?

19       A.   You did.

20       Q.   And then that was aired at 8:30 p.m., right?

21        A.   That's right.

22       Q.   Okay. Now, the other sponsor of the

23   Flintstones was Alka-Seltzer, right?

24       A.   Correct.

25       Q.   And you know Alka-Seltzer to be a product for 3529

1   heartburn, indigestion, that sort of thing?

2       A.   That's right.

3       Q.   That's another product -- well, that's a

4   product that was for adults, right?

5       A.   Sure.

6       Q.   By the way, the Flintstones was modeled after

7   another TV show called the Honeymooners, right?

8       A.   That's right.

9       Q.   Now, there did come a point in time when the

10   Flintstones went from a prime time television show for

11    adults to a Saturday morning cartoon, right?

12       A.   That's right.

13       Q.   But by then, Reynolds had stopped advertising

14   on the show, right?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   So to be clear, it was not a Saturday morning

17   cartoon when Reynolds sponsored it, was it?

18       A.   That's what I had testified to, correct.

19       Q.   Other companies in the United States have

20   used cartoon characters or animated figures to

21    advertise adult products, right?

22       A.   Sure.

23       Q.   Nothing unusual about that, is there?

24       A.   Well, in regards to cigarettes, yes.

25       Q.   Well, you've seen these examples, haven't

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=507
3530

1   you? Peanuts for MetLife. Pink Panther for housing

2   insulation, in the upper right corner. Mr. Clean, a

3   cleaning product. You've these before, haven't you?

4       A.   I have seen these kind of ads, yes.

5       Q.   And certainly children aren't usually

6   interested in buying life insurance, are they?

7       A.   No.

8       Q.   Now, another one of the shows that you showed

9   was a Winston ad from the Beverly Hillbillies, right?

10       A.   That's right.

11        Q.   Once again, you said you looked at more than

12   a dozen depositions. There is just no evidence in this

13   case that Mrs. Loyd ever watched the Beverly

14   Hillbillies, is there?

15       A.   No evidence either way, as I had mentioned

16   earlier.

17       Q.   No evidence either way. But that's the one

18   you brought to show the jury, right? One of them?

19       A.   Yeah, sure.

20       Q.   Okay. Now, Reynolds terminated its

21    sponsorship of the show in 1967, right?

22       A.   Of the Beverly Hillbillies, yes.

23       Q.   Of the Beverly Hillbillies. Right. And that

24   was -- a report came out that said high levels of

25   minors were watching, and when that report came out, 3531

1   Reynolds stopped sponsoring the show, right?

2       A.   Right. The FTC report.

3       Q.   Okay. Now, you showed us a document about

4   the Meet the Turk ad campaign, right?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   And you showed the jury a sentence on the

7   second page of that that had a reference to people in

8   the 14-to-24 age group, right?

9       A.   That's right.

10       Q.   Okay. Now, the page that you showed was a

11    cover memo, right? Transmitting the actual plan for

12   the Meet the Turk campaign?

13       A.   I think we showed both pages, but --

14       Q.   You showed both?

15       A.   Yeah.

16       Q.   Okay. But nowhere in that plan does it

17   mention any age group under 18, does it?

18       A.   On the second page of that, it mentions

19    14-to-24-year-olds.

20       Q.   Well, the age group that was identified was

21    18-to-34, was it not?

22       A.   No, sir. In the 1975 memo from Mr. Himes, it

23   says 14-to-24, as I recall.

24       Q.   Okay. Do you remember being asked the same

25   question in a case called Willis? 3532

1       A.   No. But we can look at the document. I can

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=508
2   guarantee you it's 14-to-24.

3       Q.   First I want to start with what you already

4   testified about that, and then we'll look at your

5   testimony today. Do you remember being asked this

6   question in Willis?

7       A.   No.

8       Q.   You don't?

9       A.   I don't remember being asked in Willis about

10   that.

11        Q.   Well, you do remember that Mr. Uiterwyk was

12   the lawyer asking you questions in the Willis case,

13   right?

14       A.   Yes.

15       Q.   Okay. Well, let's take a look at what your

16   testimony was from Willis in September of 2010.

17            Do you want a copy again?

18       A.   Sure.

19       Q.   Okay. As it happens, I have got several.

20       A.   Okay.

21             MR. UITERWYK: May I approach, Your Honor?

22            THE COURT: (Nods affirmatively).

23            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

24            MR. WALKER: You're welcome.

25   BY MR. WALKER: 3533

1        Q.   All right. I'm going to refer you to

2   page 2494 of your trial testimony in Willis. And,

3   again, you were in the witness box, right? This wasn't

4   a deposition?

5       A.   Correct.

6       Q.   You were talking to another jury just like

7   this jury, right?

8       A.   True.

9       Q.   Under oath?

10       A.   True.

11        Q.   With a court reporter?

12       A.   Correct.

13       Q.   Okay. Let's start at line 10.

14            And this was a cover memo from Mr. Hind to

15   Mr. Tucker, but you didn't show the actual

16   recommendation of the campaign below, so let me show

17   you that.

18            The target audience, according to the actual

19   marketing plan, was 18-to-34, correct?

20            ANSWER: Said it appeals to young adult males

21    18-to-34.

22            QUESTION: It says Turk advertising is on

23   target. It appeals to young males 18-to-34, correct?

24            ANSWER: That's right.

25            Do you remember giving that testimony now? 3534

1        A.   I do.

2       Q.   You stand by that testimony, don't you?

3       A.   Sure.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=509
4       Q.   Okay. Have you ever gone back to actually

5   look at the advertisements from RJR that were a part of

6   that campaign?

7       A.   I have.

8       Q.   Okay. But you didn't show any of those to

9   the jury in your examination, did you?

10       A.   We did not, but I'd be happy to show them.

11        Q.   Well, let's take a look.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Before - can I get a -

13            Hold on. Take it off.

14            He's showing -- and I have not even seen

15       these documents. I have not seen these, any of

16       them.

17            THE COURT: All right. Do you want to

18       approach, please, before you make speaking

19       objections?

20            (At the bench)

21             THE COURT: Don't make speaking objections.

22            MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry, Your Honor.

23            He's putting things on the screen. He's not

24       providing me a copy. I have never seen them.

25            THE COURT: Okay. 3535

1            MR. UITERWYK: I have no idea what's coming.

2            THE COURT: Okay.

3            MR. UITERWYK: And so I think he should hand

4       them to me before he talks with the witness about

5       them, before he asks the witness to identify them

6       and so forth.

7            THE COURT: All right. Before you put it up,

8       make sure you give it to the witness and have him

9       corroborate that he's seen it before, because it

10       wouldn't be -- if you're intending to impeach him

11        or whatever use, if he says he's never seen it

12       before, that may put an end to your questioning.

13            MR. WALKER: Okay.

14            THE COURT: So give a copy to counsel. Show

15       it to the witness before you project it.

16            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

17            THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

18            MR. UITERWYK: Can I have a copy?

19            MR. WALKER: Yes.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Thank you.

21             (In open court)

22   BY MR. WALKER:

23       Q.   So we were talking about the Meet the Turk

24   campaign, right?

25       A.   Yes, we were. 3536

1        Q.   All right. And I was about to show

2   something, but I should show it to you first.

3            MR. WALKER: Can I approach, Your Honor?

4            THE COURT: Yes, certainly.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=510
6       Q.   You take a look at what I was about to

7   display, and you tell me if you've seen those examples

8   from the actual Meet the Turk ad campaign.

9       A.   Yeah. This is a small sample. I have seen

10   many other examples, so this is just a selection of

11    some of them.

12       Q.   Okay.

13       A.   There are others.

14       Q.   Can I have that back?

15       A.   Sure, you may.

16       Q.   All right. So you're familiar with these

17   ads, right?

18       A.   I am.

19       Q.   All right. Thank you.

20            Okay. Can we display it now?

21     THE COURT: Yes.

22 BY MR. WALKER:

23       Q.   Let's be clear. Are these the ads that

24   you're telling this jury were designed to appeal to

25   youth? 3537

1        A.   These were from the pilot tests of the Meet

2   the Turk campaign that was done before they went with

3   the national campaign. So they are ads that were run

4   as part of that pilot, and then there are other ads

5   from Meet the Turk when it went national. That was

6   just a reference to the document that I showed the jury

7   was in regards to.

8       Q.   Yeah. Let me try that again. Are you

9   telling this jury that these Meet the Turk ads are ads

10   that are supposed to appeal to youth?

11        A.   Yeah. I mean, the campaign was definitely of

12    14-to-24-year-olds.

13       Q.   So you're asking this jury to believe that

14   this Armenian guy in the sweaty T-shirt on the left

15   there, that's part of a campaign to youth?

16            MR. UITERWYK: Objection. Argumentative,

17       Your Honor.

18            THE COURT: Sustained.

19   BY MR. WALKER:

20       Q.   How about the one with the cockatoo in the

21   bottom left one? Is that part of the same campaign to

22   appeal to youth?

23       A.   The campaign was aimed at 14-to-24-year-olds,

24   according to the documents.

25       Q.   Okay. And according to you, right? That's 3538

1   what you told this jury, didn't you?

2       A.   I was just reading the documents from your

3   client.

4       Q.   But you've seen these before, haven't you?

5       A.   Oh, yeah. I have seen them, and I have seen

6   the other Turk ads that came out as part of the

7   national campaign.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=511
8       Q.   I'm asking you. Is it your testimony that

9   this campaign, these types of ads, were calculated to

10   appeal to youth smokers?

11        A.   Yeah. There's no doubt. They modified the

12   blend, they placed advertising where young people would

13   see it, and they --

14       Q.   I'm not asking you about the blend. I'm

15   asking you about the ads.

16       A.   Well, that's part of the marketing, is the

17   blend.

18       Q.   Okay. All right. Now, you showed the jury a

19   snippet from the 1994 congressional testimony of the

20   heads of the tobacco companies, right?

21        A.   I did.

22       Q.   All right. And we talked earlier about -- if

23   I refer to those as the Waxman hearings, you'll know

24   what I am talking about, right?

25       A.   I will. 3539

1        Q.   Okay. By the way, once again, you said you

2   reviewed over a dozen transcripts in this case and

3   other materials. The fact of the matter is, there is

4   no evidence anywhere in this record that Mrs. Loyd ever

5   saw the testimony that you showed this jury, is there?

6       A.   There is no evidence one way or the other.

7       Q.   Now, at the time of the 1994 testimony,

8   Mrs. Loyd had already quit smoking, right?

9       A.   Correct.

10       Q.   Okay. And 1994 is the same year that

11    Mrs. Loyd starting telling other people that one

12   cigarette can kill you. You saw that in the record,

13   right?

14       A.   I'm not recalling what you're referring to.

15   Which record?

16       Q.   Well, in the testimony of Ms. Evers. Didn't

17   you see that she said, in 1994, Mrs. Loyd was talking

18   about one cigarette can kill you? You saw that, right?

19       A.   I'd have to have a look back at the context

20   of that statement.

21        Q.   Okay. You just don't remember?

22       A.   That's right.

23       Q.   Okay. Well, 1994 was also the same year that

24   Mrs. Loyd was telling people that cigarettes hurt your

25   health, right? 3540

1            MR. UITERWYK: Objection. Relevance, Your

2       Honor.

3            THE COURT: Overruled.

4   BY MR. WALKER:

5       Q.   Right?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   Okay. Now, when you showed that Waxman clip,

8   the one from 1994, you show -- you were identifying the

9   people at some point as to who they were as they went

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=512
10   along. And one of them was Jim Johnston, right?

11        A.   That's right.

12       Q.   And he was the CEO of my client,

13   R.J.Reynolds?

14       A.   That's right.

15       Q.   Okay. And the question he was asked was, Do

16   you believe that nicotine is addictive? Right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   Okay. And then he started by answering,

19   Smoking and nicotine clearly do not meet the classic

20   definition of addiction because there is no

21    intoxication.

22            That's how he started, right?

23       A.   Yes. He had a hard time answering yes or no.

24       Q.   You don't see anything wrong with that, do

25   you? 3541

1        A.   Sometimes it helps to have an explanation.

2       Q.   Sometimes it helps. All right. Touche.

3            Now, Congressman Wyden cut him off, though,

4   didn't he?

5       A.   He did.

6       Q.   All right. Now, that reference to the

7   classic definition, that's what the Surgeon General of

8   the United States was using in 1964, right?

9       A.   That's right.

10       Q.   That was a definition of addiction that

11    included intoxication, right?

12       A.   The requirement of the drug causing

13   intoxication, correct.

14       Q.   And when Mr. Johnston, the Reynolds CEO, said

15   that smoking and nicotine doesn't meet the classic

16   definition of addiction, that would be true because

17   smoking doesn't cause intoxication, does it?

18       A.   Well, that's --1 can't answer --1 can't

19   give a direct answer to that question. I can give you

20   an explanation.

21        Q.   Would it surprise you that you have given a

22   direct answer to that question when you were asked it

23   previously?

24       A.   Nothing would surprise me.

25       Q.   Well, let me break it up. 3542

1        A.   Sure.

2       Q.   It's true that smoking doesn't cause

3   intoxication, right?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   Okay. Intoxication was a requirement of the

6   classic definition of addiction, right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Now, Mr. Johnston never said that quitting

9   smoking was easy, did he?

10       A.   No.

11        Q.   All right. He never denied that quitting

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=513
12   smoking could be hard?

13       A.   No, he did not.

14       Q.   Now, even though you showed the jury that

15   little clip, you know that Mr. Johnston gave additional

16   testimony to Congress that you didn't show them, right?

17       A.   That's right. I have read the testimony.

18            MR. WALKER: All right. At this time, Your

19       Honor, under the rule of completeness, I would

20       like to show another portion of Mr. Johnston's

21        testimony.

22            THE COURT: All right. Show it to counsel,

23       first.

24            MR. UITERWYK: This is the first time I've

25       seen it. 3543

1            THE COURT: Okay. Well, go take a look at

2       it, please.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. I can see it but I

4       can't hear it.

5            MR. WALKER: It's a short clip, Your Honor.

6            THE COURT: Pardon me?

7            MR. WALKER: It's short.

8            (A pause was had in the proceedings.)

9            MR. UITERWYK: May we approach?

10            THE COURT: All right.

11             (At the bench)

12            MR. UITERWYK: It's not a question and an

13       answer. It's a prepared statement, a written

14       prepared statement that he's reading from. It is

15       argumentative and it's self-serving. I think the

16       Court needs to see it before you can rule on the

17       admissibility.

18            MR. WALKER: Judge, the argument when the

19       original video was played over our objection was

20       that the answer to the simple question about

21        whether nicotine was addictive was somehow

22       represented by some people saying no and

23       Mr. Johnston saying what he started to say and

24       wasn't allowed to finish.

25            What I want to play under the rule of 3544

1        completeness and as part of my cross is what

2       position was actually presented on behalf of the

3       company.

4            THE COURT: Okay. It's probably best if I

5       take a look at it. Can you go to another area?

6       And then I will take a look at it at a break. Or

7       do you want --

8            MR. WALKER: I would rather do it now.

9            THE COURT: Okay. All right. I will do it

10       now. All right. We'll take a break now and I

11        will look at it.

12            MR. WALKER: All right. Thank you, Judge.

13            (In open court)

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=514
14            THE COURT: All right. On this point, I need

15       to look at the exhibit, and so the most convenient

16       thing to do would be to take our midafternoon

17       break. Some of you are already poised like a cat

18       ready to -- we all could use a break. So we'll

19       take our midafternoon break, and we'll be in

20       recess for 20 minutes. Thank you.

21             (The jury retired from the courtroom at

22       2:53 p.m.)

23            THE COURT: Okay. Be seated. Be seated,

24       please.

25            Do you want to show the clip now? 3545

1             (A video clip was played for the jury as

2       follows:)

3            MR. JOHNSTONE: I'm Jim Johnston -

4            (The video clip was interrupted.)

5            MR. BIGGER: Do you want the witness to step

6       down?

7            THE COURT: He can stay here.

8            (A video clip was played for the jury as

9       follows:)

10            MR. JOHNSTONE: Good morning, Mr. Chairman,

11        members of the subcommittee. Again, I am Jim

12       Johnston, chairman and chief executive officer of

13       R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

14            I think the subcommittee should also be aware

15       that Dr. Kessler's definition of addiction would

16       classify most coffee, cola, and tea drinkers as

17       addicts, caffeine addicts. Many people experience

18       a strong urge for a cup of coffee each morning,

19       and there is a well-documented physical withdrawal

20       syndrome associated with the consumption of coffee

21        and caffeinated soft drinks. Nonetheless, I

22       seriously doubt that the American public would say

23       that these characteristics put caffeine in the

24       same class as addictive drugs such as cocaine and

25       heroin. 3546

1            During the past several years, there have

2       been a wide variety of attempts to convince the

3       American public that cigarettes are addictive and

4       that some public officials have even gone so far

5       as to put cigarettes in the same class as cocaine

6       and heroin. You don't need to be a trained

7       scientist to see this isn't true. All you need to

8       do is ask and honestly answer two simple

9       questions.

10            First, would you rather board a plane with a

11       pilot who just smoked a cigarette or one with a

12       pilot who just had a couple of beers or snorted

13       cocaine or shot heroin or popped some pills?

14            Second, if cigarettes were addictive, could

15       almost 43 million Americans have quit smoking,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=515
16       almost all of them on their own, without any

17       outside help?

18            The answers are obvious, and that is

19       precisely my point. Cigarettes are clearly not in

20       the same class as addictive mind-altering drugs

21        like heroin and cocaine.

22            I agree that for some people cigarette

23       smoking is habit forming, in the same way that

24       other pleasurable activities such as watching TV,

25       eating your favorite foods -- sometimes overeating 3547

1        your favorite foods -- and drinking coffee can be

2       habit forming. And, yes, some smokers find it

3       difficult to quit. But there is nothing about

4       cigarette smoking that prevents a person from

5       clearly thinking and making reasoned decisions,

6       including the decision to quit.

7            (The video clip concluded.)

8            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, it's basically a

9       narrative, self-serving statement that's read by a

10       party. That's what we are basically doing here --

11        totally self-serving, totally argumentative, and

12       it's -

13            THE COURT: Mr. Walker, I don't know that the

14       rule of completeness requires this. In my

15       understanding, the rule of completeness requires a

16       complete answer to a question.

17            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor. I was just

18       going to pull it up. The rule of completeness

19       allows a party to introduce another portion that,

20       in fairness, ought to be played with what was

21       played. It doesn't have to be the same Q and A.

22            They -- it was over our objection.

23            THE COURT: I understand.

24            MR. WALKER: They presented his original

25       answer as if that was the position of 3548

1        R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. And it wasn't.

2       The position of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was

3       what he just presented there, and the jury is

4       entitled to know that. Anything else leaves them

5       with a highly misleading impression about what the

6       testimony was during that hearing.

7            THE COURT: Okay. Let me see -- let me see

8       the authority that says -- that you're relying

9       upon.

10            MR. UITERWYK: I think he's relying on

11        90.108, Your Honor.

12            THE COURT: I know the rule. But in terms of

13       what it says specifically.

14            MR. WALKER: Just one moment, Your Honor.

15            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, one more point.

16       What they're trying to do is invalidate the Engle

17       finding in this case. The Engle found that

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=516
18       nicotine in cigarettes is addictive. And they're

19       now presenting testimony that -- apparently from

20       this gentleman, Mr. Johnston, that they're trying

21        to say, well, it technically is not addictive, and

22       they're basically trying to invalidate findings

23       that have already been found in this case.

24            MR. WALKER: Just trying to see to it that

25       the whole story is displayed, not just the part 3549

1        that the plaintiffs want, that they think favors

2       their theory.

3            The rule is 90.108. When --

4            THE COURT: Let me take a look at it.

5            MR. WALKER: Subsection one, Your Honor.

6            THE COURT: Yeah. I'm reading it to myself.

7            MR. WALKER: Okay. It also goes to

8       reprehensibility, Judge. The clip that they

9       played has nothing to do with Mrs. Loyd because it

10       was after she quit. They only showed it and they

11        were only allowed to show it because they claim it

12       goes to reprehensibility.

13            THE COURT: Okay.

14            MR. WALKER: This clip that shows the other

15       side of that coin is evidence that what he

16       actually said was not nearly as reprehensible as

17       the plaintiff suggested it was.

18            THE COURT: All right. I will sustain the

19       objection. I don't think it meets the test of the

20       rule of completeness.

21             I'm not ruling --so that counsel is clear,

22       I'm not ruling one way or the other on its

23       admissibility under any other ground, but I'm --

24       you asked it be admitted under the rule of

25       completeness. It's not going to be shown. We 3550

1        will be in recess.

2            (A recess was taken at 3:00 p.m.)

3            (Court called to order at 3:11 p.m.)

4            THE COURT: Okay. Bring the jury back,

5       please.

6            (The jury returned to the courtroom at

7       3:17 p.m.)

8            THE COURT: Thank you for your patience.

9       We're ready to continue.

10            Mr. Walker?

11             MR. WALKER: Thank you, judge.

12   BY MR. WALKER:

13       Q.   Dr. Cummings, we were just talking about the

14   Waxman hearings, right?

15       A.   Correct.

16       Q.   All right. I just want to show the jury

17   again the clip of the Waxman hearing that you chose to

18   show this jury. Okay?

19       A.   Okay.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=517
20       Q.   Just up to the part of what Mr. Johnston

21    said.

22            MR. WALKER: Can we have that? It's in

23       evidence.

24            (A video clip was played for the jury as

25       follows:) 3551

1            MR. WYDEN: Let me begin my questioning on

2       the matter of whether or not nicotine is

3       addictive. Let me ask you first -- and I would

4       like to just go down the row -- whether each of

5       you believes that nicotine is not addictive. I

6       heard virtually all of you touch on it. Just yes

7       or no, do you believe nicotine is not addictive?

8            A SPEAKER: I believe nicotine is not

9       addictive, yes.

10            MR. WYDEN: Mr. Johnston?

11             A SPEAKER: Congressman, cigarettes and

12       nicotine clearly do not meet the classic

13       definition of addiction. There is no --

14            MR. WYDEN: We'll take that as a no. And,

15       again, time is short, if I can just --1 think

16       each of you believe --

17            (Video clip concluded.)

18   BY MR. WALKER:

19       Q.   How long would you say that clip was, Dr.

20   Cummings, just that part that we saw right there?

21        A.   Maybe 40 seconds.

22       Q.   Forty seconds.

23       A.   Just guessing.

24       Q.   That's a good guess. How long would you say

25   the Waxman hearings were, all told? 3552

1        A.   Well, the hearings went for about two days.

2       Q.   Over two days?

3       A.   Yeah.

4       Q.   Okay. How long would you say is the clip

5   where Mr. Johnston was actually speaking?

6       A.   That particular clip there?

7       Q.   Yeah.

8       A.   Maybe 10 seconds or so.

9       Q.   Okay. Ten seconds out of two days of Waxman

10   hearings, right?

11        A.   Okay.

12       Q.   Okay. But you know, because you've testified

13   in 40-plus trials, you know that Mr. Johnston had other

14   things to say on that topic, don't you?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   Okay. So if all you saw was the 10-second

17   clip, do you know how many words he spoke right there?

18       A.   No, I didn't count them.

19       Q.   If I told you he had 16 words before he was

20   cut off, would you argue with me over that?

21        A.   No.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=518
22       Q.   Would you agree with me that if all you saw

23   was the 16 words that Mr. Johnston spoke over a

24    10-second clip out of the two days of the Waxman

25   hearings, you would have an incomplete picture of the 3553

1   full measure of Mr. Johnston's testimony? Is that

2   fair?

3       A.   That would not be fair, I believe. It was

4   pretty clear that he was indicating that he didn't

5   agree that cigarettes were addictive.

6       Q.   I don't think I asked you that question. I

7   asked you if you saw a 10-second clip out of two days

8   of hearings, would you agree with me that you would

9   have an incomplete picture of what Mr. Johnston's

10   remarks were?

11             MR. UITERWYK: Objection. Argumentative,

12       Your Honor.

13            THE COURT: Overruled.

14            THE WITNESS: No.

15   BY MR. WALKER:

16       Q.   Do you think that 10 seconds is all of his

17   testimony on this?

18       A.   No, I didn't say that.

19       Q.   You know he said more, right?

20       A.   I do.

21        Q.   You know he said a lot more than those 16

22   words, right?

23       A.   He gave a prepared statement.

24       Q.   Right. And you knew that before you came in

25   here with that 40-second clip, right? 3554

1        A.   I did.

2       Q.   So when you decided, just like the ads, just

3   like everything else, you made some decisions. Or

4   maybe you didn't. Who made the decision to show the

5   40-second clip out of the two days of Waxman hearings

6   that you showed this jury?

7       A.   It's an exhibit that I use in my testimony as

8   to -- so I did.

9       Q.   You made that decision?

10       A.   Yes, sir.

11        Q.   You decided that the jury was going to see

12   that 40 seconds and no more?

13       A.   No. Actually, I -- we showed all of the

14   executives. It was longer.

15       Q.   Okay. How much longer was it? How much did

16   you show the jury out of the two days? How much longer

17   than 40 seconds? I'm sorry.

18       A.   About a minute and a half.

19       Q.   Okay. Ninety seconds?

20       A.   That's about right.

21        Q.   So showing the jury 90 seconds of this

22   testimony instead of more, that was your call?

23       A.   That particular clip, yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=519
24       Q.   Okay. And then there were parts that you

25   have seen in prior litigation where Mr. Johnston goes 3555

1    on to say more, right?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   And it was your call not to include that in

4   what this jury got to see?

5       A.   It was just -- it was my call to show what

6   the executives of the companies said about nicotine

7   addiction when they were asked that question directly.

8       Q.   My question is, Was it your call to include

9   other clips from Mr. Johnston?

10       A.   No, sir.

11        Q.   That wasn't your decision?

12       A.   No.

13       Q.   Whose decision was that?

14       A.   I don't think there was any discussion about

15   it.

16       Q.   Well, you didn't play it. Somebody made the

17   decision, right?

18       A.   No, sir.

19       Q.   Were you intending to hide Mr. Johnston's

20   other remarks on this topic?

21        A.   No.

22       Q.   You just only wanted the jury to see that

23   90-second clip?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   Now, earlier, when we were talking, we had a 3556

1   moment of laughter there where you told me that

2   sometimes you need to see the full explanation.

3            Do you remember that?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   Okay. There is a more complete answer on

6   this topic than 16 words, right?

7       A.   As I indicated, yes, there is. He gave a

8   written testimony.

9       Q.   And the fair thing to do for somebody who

10   wants all the facts would be to see that, wouldn't it?

11             MR. UITERWYK: Objection. Argumentative,

12       Your Honor.

13            THE COURT: Sustained.

14   BY MR. WALKER:

15       Q.   You've seen it, haven't you?

16       A.   Yes.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor -

18            THE COURT: Sustained. Move on, Counsel,

19       prior to my ruling. Move on, please.

20            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, at this time I would

21        ask to show the clip.

22            THE COURT: I've already ruled that out.

23   BY MR. WALKER:

24       Q.   Okay. Earlier, we were talking about the

25   Willow Ridge letter. Do you remember that?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=520
3557

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   And I asked you about whether the Willow

3   Ridge letter was shown to the students, was shared with

4   the students. Do you remember that?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   And you said it was, right?

7       A.   I was asking for clarification on which

8   students, and I -- yes, it has been shared with

9   students at Willow Ridge but not the students who wrote

10   the letter.

11        Q.   Okay. So tell me if you would agree with me

12   on this, because I'm not sure where you are on this

13   now.

14       A.   Sure.

15       Q.   You don't have any evidence that the

16   principal shared that letter with the students, do you?

17       A.   No, they did not. The principal did not

18   share the letter with the students.

19       Q.   All right. Thank you.

20            All right. Now, in 1988 the Surgeon General

21    issued a report on smoking and health, right?

22       A.   Correct.

23       Q.   And that was -- in that report, the Surgeon

24   General labeled smoking as an addiction, right?

25       A.   Nicotine as an addictive drug, yes. 3558

1        Q.   And that was the first Surgeon General's

2   report that had that conclusion, right?

3       A.   That's not the first one.

4       Q.   Okay.

5       A.   It's the first one that had that as a

6   conclusion, correct.

7       Q.   That was what I meant to ask you.

8            Okay. Now, that report was released about 10

9   years before any internal company documents were

10   released that you talked about, right?

11        A.   That report was issued, yes, before the

12   internal records became available, that's true.

13       Q.   Okay. So the authors of that Surgeon General

14   report didn't need those internal company documents to

15   reach those conclusions, did they?

16       A.   True.

17       Q.   Now, in 1988 when the Surgeon General said

18   what it said about addiction, it was using a different

19   definition, one that did not include intoxication as an

20   element, right?

21        A.   Correct.

22       Q.   But in 1964, under the Surgeon General's

23   definition, intoxication was required, right?

24       A.   Well, that's not entirely right, the way you

25   phrased it. 3559

1       Q.   Okay. In 1964 under the classic definition

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=521
2   of addiction, intoxication was required, right?

3       A.   That was the WHO definition at the time, and

4   the committee -- the advisory committee adopted that

5   definition.

6       Q.   That means yes, right?

7       A.   That's what I -- that was the clarification I

8   was trying to give you.

9       Q.   Okay. Now, you've talked a lot about

10   cigarette smoking generally and smokers generally, and

11    you even showed a chart that had per capita consumption

12   rates.

13            Do you remember that?

14       A.   You said --

15       Q.   Per capita consumption rates, that's not any

16   individual's consumption, right?

17       A.   No. It's per capita, 18 and older in the

18   population.

19       Q.   And per capita also means that's not

20   Ms. Loyd's smoking. Her smoking wasn't going up and

21    down and all around like you were showing on that

22   chart, was it?

23       A.   No. It's per capita.

24       Q.   That chart wasn't really about Mrs. Loyd

25   specifically, was it? It was about per capita? 3560

1        A.   It was.

2       Q.   Okay. And, now, we're going to talk about

3   your opinions about that, but, first, I actually want

4   to ask you about Mrs. Loyd --

5       A.   Sure.

6       Q.    and the information that was available in

7   her environment and her cultural context. Okay?

8       A.   Sure.

9       Q.   All right. First of all, Mrs. Loyd's parents

10   did not agree with smoking, did they?

11        A.   No.

12       Q.   And Mrs. Loyd's parents didn't smoke

13   cigarettes, did they?

14       A.   True.

15       Q.   And they didn't want Mrs. Loyd or her brother

16   Jack to smoke, did they?

17       A.   According to the brother Jack, yes.

18       Q.   Well, they had a rule that smoking was not

19   allowed in their home, right?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   And Mrs. Loyd never smoked inside her

22   parents' home even when she was older and was just

23   visiting, right?

24       A.   As far as I know, that's from the testimony.

25   That's true. 3561

1        Q.   Okay. And in the late 1940s, Mrs. Loyd's

2   father had breathing problems, right?

3       A.   Correct.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=522
4       Q.   And you saw the evidence in the record that

5   the family associated that with his use of other types

6   of tobacco, right?

7            MR. UITERWYK: Objection. Hearsay, Your

8       Honor.

9            THE COURT: Overruled.

10   BY MR. WALKER:

11        Q.   You saw that, right?

12       A.   I believe he smoked cigars.

13       Q.   Cigars.

14            All right. Now, Mrs. Loyd was aware that the

15   family associated her father's breathing difficulties

16   with his tobacco use, right?

17       A.   I don't know that.

18       Q.   You don't remember that?

19       A.   I don't know that.

20       Q.   Okay. In fact, Mrs. Loyd's brother quit

21    smoking in 1970, right?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   Okay. And he told her why he quit smoking,

24   didn't he?

25       A.   He did. 3562

1        Q.   He told her that he quit because his mother

2   had requested on her deathbed --

3            MR. BIGGER: Your Honor, objection. Hearsay.

4            THE COURT: Sustained.

5            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I need to be heard

6       on that.

7            THE COURT: Okay.

8            (At the bench)

9            THE COURT: This is a question the Court --

10            MR. WALKER: To her. It's not being used for

11        the truth, it's being used for a notice. It's a

12       warnings occasion.

13            THE COURT: Okay. Get the question out that

14       you were going to ask that was objected to.

15            MR. WALKER: The question was that he told

16       her he quit smoking because his mother asked him

17       to quit smoking on her deathbed. And the next

18       question is it was because it's unhealthy. That's

19       what's told her. It's notice.

20            MR. UITERWYK: It's actually double hearsay.

21             MR. WALKER: It doesn't matter whether it's

22       true; it only matters that she was told it.

23            MR. UITERWYK: But he's offering it -- he --

24            THE COURT: Let me hear from Mr. Pedrosa.

25            MR. PEDROSA: Mr. Smith, Jack Smith, made up 3563

1        the story to tell it to Jackie Loyd to try to get

2       her to quit. And it was absolutely conceded by

3       all that it's not true. It would still be just

4       relevant because it would go to Mrs. Loyd's

5       knowledge about what she knew about the health

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=523
6       risk of smoking. It doesn't matter whether the

7       story is true; it only matters if that's what she

8       thought or believed, based on what Jack Smith told

9       her.

10            MR. WALKER: And that's why -

11             THE COURT: It goes to the issue of what?

12            MR. WALKER: Of her awareness.

13            MR. PEDROSA: Her notice, knowledge.

14            THE COURT: Her notice of what?

15            MR. WALKER: The health risks of cigarette

16       smoking.

17            THE COURT: Then --so you're offering it for

18       the truth of the matter asserted?

19            MR. WALKER: No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

20            THE COURT: Why not?

21             MR. WALKER: Because if somebody says to you,

22       You need to quit smoking; it's bad for your

23       health, it doesn't matter whether it's true; it

24       only matters that you are told.

25            THE COURT: But you're offering it to show 3564

1        that she had notice that smoking was bad for her.

2            MR. WALKER: It's not hearsay that the

3       statement was made to her. Jack Smith says that.

4       He testified that he told her.

5            THE COURT: It has to be - but the

6       statement -- you're offering it for the truth that

7       smoking is bad.

8            MR. WALKER: No. I'm offering it for the

9       truth that she was told that smoking was bad.

10       Whether it's bad or not, she was told it. They

11        are saying that we concealed information. We're

12       saying she got that same information from other

13       people, including her brother Jack, whether it's

14       true or not.

15            MR. UITERWYK: He's conveying what her mother

16       told Jack, or stated that Jack told her mother.

17            MR. WALKER: It's what Jack told her that's

18       important.

19            THE COURT: Yeah. Well, but Jack heard it

20       from their mother, correct? Right?

21             MR. WALKER: If it mattered - if it mattered

22       whether it was true, yeah. But it doesn't matter

23       where Jack heard it.

24            MR. PEDROSA: If Mrs. Loyd believed that her

25       mother told Jack Smith X, Y, or Z, that's all that 3565

1        matters. It doesn't matter whether it's true or

2       not. It's only what Mrs. Loyd knew, what she was

3       aware of, what warnings she got.

4            MR. WALKER: They're saying she wasn't

5       warned. This is evidence that she was warned.

6            THE COURT: It goes to - what I'm having

7       trouble with is understanding the using. It goes

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=524
8       to the notice issue, but it has to be true.

9            MR. WALKER: It doesn't have to be true to be

10       notice.

11             MR. UITERWYK: They are --

12            MR. WALKER: If -- Your Honor, if there is a

13       car accident and somebody comes in here and made

14       up a story and said, Hey, I heard this story that

15       there was this car accident outside, the fact of

16       the matter is everybody who hears it is on notice

17       of it, whether it's true or not. It doesn't

18       matter whether it's true; it only matters that she

19       received the warning. She heard the warning.

20            MR. UITERWYK: But the warning -

21             MR. WALKER: They've showed countless

22       documents that they say were made available to the

23       public and wasn't true. It doesn't matter.

24            MR. PEDROSA: And there's no dispute in this

25       case that cigarette smoking causes harm to your 3566

1        health. Nobody is up here trying to prove that.

2       That's --

3            THE COURT: Right. I need to -

4            MR. PEDROSA: We don't need to prove that.

5            THE COURT: I need to think through this a

6       little bit more. Just go to a different topic,

7       and we'll -- I'm not sure. And I know it's

8       important to all of you, but it seems to me it's

9       being offered for the truth of the matter. But I

10       need -- what if she said -- well, I don't want

11        to -- go to another area.

12            MR. UITERWYK: I'm going to pull the

13       transcript.

14            (In open court)

15   BY MR. WALKER:

16       Q.   Okay. Dr. Cummings, we were talking about

17   what Jack told Mrs. Loyd. Do you remember that?

18       A.   I think you were --

19       Q.   That's what we were talking about.

20       A.   Okay. I thought you were talking about the

21    fact that Jack had quit smoking.

22       Q.   What I was getting to -- where we need to be

23   right now is what Jack told Mrs. Loyd. Okay? Are you

24   with me in time and place?

25       A.   Sure. 3567

1        Q.   Okay. You saw the evidence in the record

2   that Mr. Smith, Jack Smith, told his sister that

3   quitting would be beneficial to her health, right?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   You also read Ron Cahill's deposition, right?

6       A.   I did.

7       Q.   Okay. And you know about the discussions

8   that Ron Cahill had had with Mrs. Loyd too, right?

9       A.   I read the deposition.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=525
10       Q.   All right. But one of those was, Ron Cahill

11    also encouraged Mrs. Loyd to quit smoking, didn't he?

12       A.   Yes.

13            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'm going to

14       object again. We've got hearsay again.

15            THE COURT: Overruled.

16   BY MR. WALKER:

17       Q.   And Mr. Cahill told her that he thought it

18   would be better for her health if she stopped smoking,

19   right?

20       A.   I don't recall that.

21        Q.   Are you telling me he didn't say that or you

22   just don't remember it?

23       A.   I'm saying I don't recall it.

24       Q.   Okay.

25       A.   I mean, I don't dispute it; I just haven't 3568

1   memorized every word.

2       Q.   Now, you read the deposition of

3   Ms. Hart-Casper, right? That was one of the ones?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   And you know from the deposition that

6   Mrs. Evers, the plaintiff, from the time she was a

7   little girl, asked Mrs. Loyd not to smoke cigarettes,

8   right?

9       A.   I don't recall that.

10       Q.   Okay. You are not telling me it's wrong; you

11   just don't remember?

12       A.   Correct.

13       Q.   Okay. And Mr. Loyd, Ellis Loyd, Mrs. Loyd's

14   husband for whom she has the last name Loyd, you know

15   that he also encouraged her to quit smoking, right?

16       A.   I'm not sure about encourage. I mean, he was

17   aware that she was trying to quit many times.

18       Q.   I'm asking you if you remember reading where

19   he said that he encouraged her to stop smoking.

20       A.   I think so, yes.

21        Q.   Okay. You also know from your review of the

22   record that Mrs. Loyd actually caught the plaintiff in

23   this case, Mrs. Evers, smoking when she was young,

24   right? You saw that?

25       A.   Who caught her smoking? 3569

1        Q.   Mrs. Loyd caught Mrs. Evers smoking?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   You remember that, right?

4       A.   I do.

5       Q.   And she punished her for that. You remember

6   that?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Okay. Now, I want to move back to your

9   testimony more about smokers generally. We've now

10   talked a bit about Mrs. Loyd. I want to get back to

11    your testimony about smoking generally. Okay?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=526
12       A.   Okay. Sure.

13       Q.   And I think you testified that, in your

14   opinion, the vast majority of information that was out

15   there was promoting smoking. Did you say that?

16       A.   Yes, sir.

17       Q.   Okay.

18       A.   Just based on the amount of money that was

19   being spent.

20       Q.   And a lot of what you were talking about in

21    terms of what you showed the jury were TV ads. You

22   testified about newspapers and magazines, right?

23       A.   Yes. What time frame are you referring to?

24       Q.   Just all of your testimony?

25       A.   No. I need to know specifically the time 3570

1   frame, because it's changed over time.

2       Q.   Okay. Well, at some point in time your

3   opinions are based on what was available on TV, right?

4       A.   That's --

5       Q.   All right. That would be, what, sometime in

6   the fifties forward?

7       A.   Sure.

8       Q.   Okay. But before that and after that, you

9   are relying on information that was available in

10   newspapers and magazines too, right?

11        A.   All forms of advertising.

12       Q.   All forms of advertising.

13            Now, of course, we've already discussed and

14   you know from your review of the deposition testimony

15   that Mrs. Loyd didn't watch much TV, right?

16       A.   Yes, I do.

17       Q.   And we talked earlier about how the testimony

18   is that she wasn't reading newspapers either, right?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   Or magazines, right?

21        A.   Wasn't subscribing to magazines.

22       Q.   Okay. Other than livestock magazine, right?

23       A.   Correct.

24       Q.   Okay. But you would agree with me that it's

25   been common knowledge, common knowledge in this country 3571

1   for more than 100 years, that it can be difficult for

2   people to quit smoking, right?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   Smoking has been referred to as addictive and

5   as an addiction for more than 100 years, right?

6       A.   Yes. You can find references to that in

7   various publications.

8       Q.   And you can find references to the term

9   "nicotine fiend" for 100 years, right?

10       A.   I have not done that calculation, but I don't

11    dispute that.

12       Q.   Okay. You are also familiar with the term

13    "nicotine fit," right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=527
14       A.   Sure.

15       Q.   A person can say, I'm having a nicotine fit.

16   You're familiar with that expression, right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   Okay.

19       A.   A craving for, you know, nicotine.

20       Q.   Those were popular terms that people in this

21    country have used to talk about cigarettes and their

22   use of cigarettes, right?

23       A.   Those are the terms that have been used. I'm

24   not sure how popular they are.

25       Q.   Well, they all convey the notion that 3572

1    cigarette smoking, tobacco use in general is hard to

2   give up, right?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   They also convey that nicotine is a factor in

5   why people smoke?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   Now, since you talked about the popular

8   press, you would agree with me that the popular press

9   in this country has talked about the fact that smoking

10   can be dangerous and difficult to quit for well over

11    100 years, right?

12       A.   You can find references. There are many more

13   in recent times than there were in the earlier times in

14   this century.

15       Q.   And you can go back even to Christopher

16   Columbus, right?

17       A.   In what regards?

18       Q.   Well, when Christopher Columbus and his

19   sailors were going back to Europe, you know that

20   Columbus observed that many of his men had a hard time

21    giving up tobacco, right?

22       A.   Yes. It's mentioned in the Surgeon General's

23   report.

24       Q.   And that was more than 500 years ago, right?

25       A.   I'm recalling the reference from the '88 3573

1    Surgeon General's report.

2       Q.   Okay. He didn't need an internal company

3   document to tell him that, did he?

4       A.   Tell him what?

5       Q.   To tell him that it can be hard to give up

6   tobacco.

7       A.   Well, no. He didn't have internal documents.

8   It might have been helpful.

9       Q.   It's been known going back to the 1820s that

10   nicotine is in tobacco, right?

11        A.   Sure.

12       Q.   And that's almost 200 years ago?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   Now, nicotine was named for a Frenchman,

15   right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=528
16       A.   Jean Nicotina (sic). Yeah.

17       Q.   How did you say that?

18       A.   Jean Nicotina.

19       Q.   Jean Nicotina. Okay. And he was someone who

20   lived in the 17th century, right?

21        A.   That's right.

22       Q.   And you've also seen a letter written by

23   president John Quincy Adams in 1845 about these issues

24   more than 170 years ago, right?

25       A.   Yes. At trial. 3574

1        Q.   Okay. And he was writing to his reverend,

2   Samuel Cox?

3       A.   Correct.

4       Q.   Now, John Quincy Adams was not a doctor or a

5   scientist, right?

6       A.   No.

7       Q.   But he wrote, In my early youth I was

8   addicted to the use of tobacco in two of its mysteries,

9   smoking and chewing. Right? You know that, don't you?

10            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I -- withdrawn.

11    BY MR. WALKER:

12       Q.   Okay. You mentioned that the Surgeon

13   General's report, the 1988 Surgeon General's report,

14   indicated that it was known from the 1920s that smokers

15   smoked for nicotine, right?

16       A.   I wouldn't say it was known. What I would

17   say is you can find a reference to articles in the

18   published literature at that time.

19       Q.   I'm asking you what the Surgeon General said

20   in the 1988 Surgeon General's report. Didn't that

21    report indicate that it was known in the 1920s that

22   smokers smoked for nicotine?

23       A.   Yes, it did say. They were referencing back

24   published papers.

25       Q.   Now, you're familiar with Reader's Digest, 3575

1   right?

2       A.   Sure.

3       Q.   In the 1930s and the 1940s and even into the

4    1950s, Reader's Digest was the No. 1 publication in

5   this country --

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.    for people who were reading magazines,

8   right?

9       A.   That's right.

10       Q.   Okay. Reader's Digest went into hundreds of

11    thousands of households across America?

12       A.   It was a popular magazine, yes.

13       Q.   One in four -- one in four American

14   households subscribed to Reader's Digest during this

15   time period in the thirties, forties, and fifties?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   Now, I'm going to give you a chance to clear

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=529
18   something up for this trial. Reader's Digest never

19   accepted tobacco advertising, did they?

20       A.   No, they did not.

21        Q.   Okay. Not only did they not accept tobacco

22   advertising, they published a number of anti-tobacco

23   articles, right?

24       A.   A number of them. Out of the many thousands

25   of articles, they wrote a handful on tobacco. 3576

1        Q.   Did you think I was asking you to quantify

2   and compare to the total number of articles?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   That's what you thought I was asking you?

5       A.   You said a number.

6       Q.   Okay.

7       A.   I was just trying to give you a frame of

8   reference.

9       Q.   Okay. Reader's Digest first published an

10   article describing smoking as a cause of cancer in

11    1924, right?

12       A.   That's right.

13       Q.   And that article wouldn't have been based on

14   any secret documents, would it?

15       A.   It was on tobacco, no. It wasn't based on

16   secret documents.

17       Q.   Because that was 70 years before you say

18   internal company documents were released, right?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   Now, the Reader's Digest articles weren't

21    written for scientists, were they?

22       A.   No.

23       Q.   They were written for the general public?

24       A.   Correct.

25       Q.   So they used language that ordinary people 3577

1    could understand, right?

2       A.   They did.

3       Q.   And, in fact, the Surgeon General has

4   recognized that Reader's Digest articles had an impact

5   on what Americans knew about the dangers of smoking,

6   right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Okay. And just to be clear, Reader's Digest

9   wasn't the only publication that carried information

10   about the health risks of smoking in this period, was

11    it?

12       A.   What period are we referring to?

13       Q.   The 1930s, forties, and fifties.

14       A.   It was the main one. But you can --

15   particularly in more recent times, like in the fifties,

16   you can find references in popular media. I think we

17   showed Life magazine, for example.

18       Q.   Well, it's not just Life; it's Time magazine,

19   Newsweek, and others, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=530
20       A.   Sure.

21        Q.   Okay. Now, Reader's Digest articles that

22   were publish in the thirties, forties, and fifties

23   refer to nicotine as a drug, right?

24       A.   Some of them do.

25       Q.   Okay. And their articles reported that 3578

1   people could be addicted to nicotine, right?

2       A.   A handful of them do. Most talk about it as

3   a habit, just to be fair about it.

4       Q.   And you're familiar with those articles from

5   Reader's Digest, right?

6       A.   Sure.

7            MR. WALKER: May I approach the witness, Your

8       Honor?

9            THE COURT: (Indicating affirmatively).

10            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

11             MR. WALKER: You are welcome.

12   BY MR. WALKER:

13       Q.   All right. So I've just handed you a copy of

14   a Reader's Digest article. The cover page is first,

15   and then the article starts on the second page.

16            Do you see that?

17       A.   I do.

18       Q.   That's from 1935, right?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   Okay. And this is an article that you have

21    seen before, right?

22       A.   In trial, yeah.

23       Q.   You have taken articles like that into

24   consideration when you have given your opinions, right?

25       A.   I have. 3579

1            MR. WALKER: Okay. Judge, I would like to

2       display this particular Reader's Digest article

3       from 1935.

4            THE COURT: Any objection?

5            MR. UITERWYK: Just a minute, Your Honor.

6            THE COURT: Sir?

7            MR. UITERWYK: Just a minute. I just got it.

8            THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Uiterwyk?

9            MR. UITERWYK: I'm sorry, Your Honor. I

10       thought he was waiting. I have no objection.

11             THE COURT: Okay.

12            MR. WALKER: All right. Can we display this,

13       please? I would like the first page.

14   BY MR. WALKER:

15       Q.   All right. So this is Reader's Digest.

16            MR. WALKER: Can we just zoom in on the date

17       there.

18   BY MR. WALKER:

19       Q.   All right. February 1935, right?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Some of the same time period of some of the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=531
22   ads you showed the jury, right?

23       A.   That's right.

24            MR. WALKER: Okay. Can I have the next page?

25   BY MR. WALKER: 3580

1        Q.   All right. The title there is, what, On

2   Giving Up Smoking?

3       A.   Correct.

4       Q.   All right. And can we just zoom in on the

5   part that's highlighted there? Tell me if I have this

6   right, on this article from 1935. Quote, surely you, a

7   rational being, are not going to admit yourself a slave

8   to this drug.

9            Do you see that?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   And they are talking about cigarettes, right?

12       A.   That's right.

13            MR. WALKER: Okay. May I approach the

14       witness, Your Honor?

15            THE COURT: Yes.

16            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

17            MR. WALKER: You're welcome.

18   BY MR. WALKER:

19       Q.   All right. I just handed you another article

20   from Reader's Digest, right?

21        A.   You have.

22       Q.   And this one is from 1938?

23       A.   Correct.

24       Q.   And you've seen this article before, haven't

25   you? 3581

1        A.   I have.

2       Q.   Took it into account in giving your opinions?

3       A.   I did.

4            MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, at this time

5       I would like to display this 1938 Reader's Digest

6       article.

7            MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

8            THE COURT: All right.

9   BY MR. WALKER:

10       Q.   All right. Again, Reader's Digest, we see

11    the date there is August 1938.

12            Do you see that?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   Okay.

15       A.   Three dollars a year.

16       Q.   Three dollars a year. That doesn't sound too

17   bad, does it?

18            Let's take a look at the -- well, let me ask

19   you. This article refers to cigarette smoking as an

20   addiction that an individual is wrestling with; is that

21    right?

22       A.   That's right.

23       Q.   Okay. Let's take a look at the highlighted

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=532
24   part there just right at the beginning.

25            So you're going to stop smoking. Sooner or 3582

1   later, nearly every cigarette smoker discovers that he

2   is not smoking by choice but by habit and that the

3   habit is probably harmful.

4            And then a little bit below that, Sometimes

5   halfheartedly, sometimes earnestly, he wrestles with

6   his addiction but in vain.

7            Did I read that correctly?

8       A.   Yes.

9            MR. UITERWYK: Under the rule of

10       completeness, can he read the line also that's not

11        highlighted?

12   BY MR. WALKER:

13       Q.   So he tries to break free from it, but finds

14   that he doesn't know how, sometimes halfheartedly,

15   sometimes earnestly. He wrestles with his addiction

16   but in vain.

17            MR. UITERWYK: Keep on going.

18   BY MR. WALKER:

19       Q.   His self-control has been perilously

20   undermined by a mere mechanism of habit.

21             Did I read all that right?

22       A.   You did.

23            MR. WALKER: Okay. May I approach the

24       witness, Your Honor?

25            THE COURT: Yes. 3583

1            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

2            MR. WALKER: You're welcome.

3   BY MR. WALKER:

4       Q.   All right. I have just handed you another

5   Reader's Digest article, have I not?

6       A.   You have.

7       Q.   This one is from 1940?

8       A.   Correct.

9       Q.   And, certainly, you're familiar with this

10   article, are you not?

11        A.I am.

12       Q.   Took it into consideration when giving your

13   opinions?

14       A.   I have.

15            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, at this time I would

16       ask to publish this 1940 article from Reader's

17       Digest.

18            MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

19            THE COURT: All right.

20   BY MR. WALKER:

21        Q.   Another Reader's Digest article, this time

22   from July 1940.

23            Do you see that?

24       A.   Yes.

25            MR. WALKER: Okay. Can we have the next

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=533
3584

1       page, please?

2   BY MR. WALKER:

3       Q.   Let's just get the title first. I Quit

4   Smoking, or, Cooper's Last Stand. Bless you.

5            Do you see that?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   All right. If we could zoom in on the second

8   column there. For more than 40 years I had sucked up

9   nicotine like a filling station sponge.

10            Do you see that?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Now, this article that you've seen before,

13   it's recounting the author's experience in quitting

14   smoking, right?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   And he's advocating consumers to quit, right?

17       A.   Yes.

18            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

19            (A document was shown to the witness).

20            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

21    BY MR. WALKER:

22       Q.   I've just handed you another Reader's Digest

23   article, right?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   This one from 1941? 3585

1        A.   Correct.

2       Q.   Same time period as some of the

3   advertisements that you were showing, right?

4       A.   That's right.

5       Q.   Okay. And you're familiar with this article

6   as well, aren't you?

7       A.   I am.

8       Q.   Took it into account in giving your

9   testimony, right?

10       A.   Yes, sir.

11             MR. WALKER: Your Honor, at this time I will

12       ask to publish this 1941 Reader's Digest article.

13            MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

14            THE COURT: All right.

15   BY MR. WALKER:

16       Q.   Reader's Digest, December 1941, right?

17       A.   Correct.

18       Q.   Okay. This one is called -- can we have the

19   next page -- Nicotine Knockout, or, The Slow Count by

20   Gene Tunney.

21             Do you see that?

22       A.   Tunney.

23       Q.   Tunney.

24       A.   Yeah. He's the former heavyweight champion

25   of the world. 3586

1       Q.   All right. And he certainly wasn't a

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=534
2   scientist, right?

3       A.   No. He was not a scientist, but he was

4   involved in the military in the Navy fitness program.

5       Q.   Very famous boxer, right?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   And he had fought Jack Dempsey twice for the

8   title, right?

9       A.   That's right.

10       Q.   In fact, there was a very famous moment in

11    sports relating to Mr. Tunney, right, for people who

12   followed it? Do you know what I am talking about?

13       A.   No.

14       Q.   Well, he survived the second fight with

15   Dempsey because the referee gave him a slow count

16   getting back up to his feet, right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   Now you know what I am talking about, don't

19   you?

20       A.   Right.

21        Q.   And he took that title, and he put it as a

22   part of this article, right?

23       A.   Yes, he did.

24       Q.   It was good marketing for the article, wasn't

25   it? 3587

1        A.   Yes, sir.

2       Q.   Okay. Now, by the time he writes this

3   article in 1941, Mr. Tunney is retired from boxing,

4   right?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   The heavyweight champ by this time was Joe

7   Louis?

8       A.   That's right.

9       Q.   Okay. Now, in this article, Gene Tunney

10   says, You know what, I'll challenge Joe Louis if he'll

11    start smoking cigarettes before we have the fight,

12   right?

13       A.   He was smoking.

14       Q.   Sorry?

15       A.   Joe Louis was smoking. He was one of those

16   celebrities advertising cigarettes at that time.

17       Q.   Okay. But in this article -- you understand

18   I'm asking you about this article, right?

19       A.   Okay.

20       Q.   In this article, Gene Tunney says, I'll

21    challenge Joe Louis for the title if he'll start

22   smoking before we have the fight, right?

23       A.   That's right.

24       Q.   Okay. And he's saying that because it's

25   understood that smoking would prevent Joe Louis from 3588

1   really putting out his best effort, right?

2       A.   Yes, sir.

3       Q.   Okay. Now, Mr. Tunney was hired by the Navy

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=535
4   during World War II, you mentioned, right?

5       A.   Yes, that's right. He was in the military.

6       Q.   He was the chief health officer?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   Okay. And one of the things he did was to

9   address smoking with people in the Navy, right?

10       A.   Correct.

11        Q.   All right. Let's take a look at what he says

12   in this particular article on the left side.

13            Heavy smoking has a positive and demonstrably

14   bad effect on longevity, physical and nervous energy,

15   and general health. With every puff, heavy smokers

16   shorten their own lives.

17            Did I read that right?

18       A.   You did.

19       Q.   Okay.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Can you read the rest, please,

21        under the rule of completeness?

22            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I don't think that's

23       a proper use of the rule of completeness.

24            THE COURT: Okay. I need to see the article.

25            (At the bench) 3589

1            THE COURT: How much do you want to read?

2            MR. BIGGER: Just through the 43,436 died

3       before that age, of nonsmokers.

4            MR. WALKER: To where?

5            THE COURT: You don't have your copy.

6            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Judge. Just to 60.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Keep on going, before that

8       age.

9            MR. WALKER: I'll read that, yeah.

10            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. That's what I wanted to

11        do.

12            (In open court)

13   BY MR. WALKER:

14       Q.   All right. Dr. Cummings, I have been asked

15   to read a little bit more. Okay?

16       A.   Sure.

17       Q.   So I'm going to start on the left side. I'm

18   just going to start with that paragraph and read what I

19   have been asked to read from this 1941 article. Okay?

20       A.   Okay.

21        Q.   With every puff heavy smokers shorten their

22   own lives. Dr. Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins found

23   that among 100,000 heavy -- over 10 cigarettes a day --

24   smokers, 53,774 died before the age of 60. Among the

25   same number of nonsmokers, only 43,436 died before that 3590

1    age.

2            Is that it? Did I read that correctly?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   Okay. So this same article that Mr. Tunney

5   has put out that says -- the most popular magazine in

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=536
6   America is actually reporting on this study from Dr.

7   Raymond Pearl of Johns Hopkins, right?

8       A.   That's right.

9       Q.   And that's in 1941?

10       A.   Correct.

11        Q.   Now, let's take a look at -- no. Let's go

12   back, first.

13            MR. WALKER: Okay. Right side of the page,

14       the cause.

15   BY MR. WALKER:

16       Q.   Okay. Same article. The cause of most of

17   the trouble is, of course, nicotine. No one has ever

18   denied that nicotine is poison.

19            Do you see that?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Okay. Let's go down to the bottom of that

22   page. Still talking about nicotine, right?

23       A.   Yes.

24       Q.   This powerful poison is the source of all the

25    "pleasure" derived from smoking. 3591

1            And pleasure is in quotes, right?

2            MR. UITERWYK: Judge, could we go back,

3       please?

4            THE COURT: Let him finish this, please.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6       Q.   "Pleasure" is in quotes?

7       A.   It is.

8       Q.   Okay. It touches off the mechanism by which

9   the adrenal glands release quick energy from the liver

10   and muscles. You do get a "lift" when you light a

11    cigarette, but it's exactly like the lift you get from

12   cocaine, heroin, marijuana.

13            Did I read that correctly?

14       A.   You did.

15       Q.   And this is all in 1941, right?

16       A.   Correct.

17            MR. UITERWYK: If we can go back to the

18       paragraph that you were reading from, please.

19       Rule of completeness, Your Honor, Luckily the bulk

20       of nicotine --

21    BY MR. WALKER:

22       Q.   All right. I don't know if you can get it

23   there, but I have been asked to read you the following

24   sentence from the right column. Okay?

25       A.   Okay. 3592

1        Q.   Okay. Luckily, the bulk of the nicotine in

2   tobacco is volatilized in smoke; you do not get the

3   poison straight.

4            Did I read that right?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   And that's right before it says, The powerful

7   poison is the source of all the "pleasure," in

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=537
8   quotation marks, derived from smoking; is that right?

9       A.   That's right.

10       Q.   Okay. Now, by the way, that comparison of

11    nicotine to cocaine, heroine, and marijuana, you saw

12   that, right?

13       A.   I did.

14       Q.   That's not -- that's pretty similar to what

15   the Surgeon General said in 1988, isn't it?

16       A.   In different context, yes.

17       Q.   Okay. But, of course, this was 47 years

18   earlier, right?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   All right. Now, you can agree with me, can't

21    you, that cigarette smoking has been one of the most

22   studied causes of disease in human history, right?

23       A.   I would agree with that.

24       Q.   And we are probably coming up on something

25   like 100,000 scientific studies on smoking and health 3593

1   in the world literature today?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   All right. No other health issue has

4   received more attention from the Surgeon General than

5   cigarette smoking, has it?

6       A.   I would agree with that.

7       Q.   The dangers of smoking have been discussed by

8   the media in this country for over 100 years, right?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   Now, people in this country have also

11    referred to cigarettes as coffin nails, right?

12       A.   I've heard that term.

13       Q.   That term goes back to the late 1800s, early

14    1900s, right?

15       A.   I don't know the original source, but it goes

16   back a long time.

17       Q.   Okay. And the idea being that a cigarette is

18   another nail in your coffin, right?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   People have also referred to cigarettes as

21    cancer sticks, right?

22       A.   I have heard that.

23       Q.   And you've seen that -- you have seen

24   references to cancer sticks and coffin nails in the

25   media, haven't you? 3594

1        A.   I have.

2            MR. WALKER: All right. May I approach, Your

3       Honor?

4            THE COURT: Yes.

5            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

6   BY MR. WALKER:

7       Q.   By the way, Dr. Cummings, these Reader's

8   Digest articles that I am showing you, they are part of

9   telling the whole story about this issue, aren't they?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=538
10       A.   In what regards?

11        Q.   Well, you didn't show any Reader's Digest

12   articles in your presentation, did you?

13       A.   No, I did not show any Reader's Digest

14   articles in my presentation.

15       Q.   Okay. All right. I will hand you a Reader's

16   Digest article from 1952. Do you see that?

17       A.   I do.

18       Q.   And this is another one of those Reader's

19   Digest articles that you have seen before, right?

20       A.   I have.

21        Q.   You're familiar with it?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   You took it into account in giving your

24   testimony, right?

25       A.   I certainly did. 3595

1            MR. WALKER: Okay. I would ask to publish

2       this 1952 article from Reader's Digest.

3            MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

4            THE COURT: All right.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6       Q.   Now, the truth is, this is a pretty

7   well-known article, isn't it --

8       A.   It is.

9       Q.    this particular one?

10       A.   Well-

11        Q.   All right.  1952. Let's get to the title.

12   Cancer by the Carton, right?

13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   When you're buying a carton of cigarettes,

15   you're buying a carton of cancer. That's the theme,

16   right?

17       A.   The theme is talking about the research that

18   was coming out, yes.

19       Q.   It's a pretty graphic theme, right?

It's a good title.

Easy to understand?

Yes, sir.

Definitely not a secret, right?

What is not a secret?

This article.

20       A.

21        Q.

22       A.

23       Q.

24       A.

25       Q. 3596

1        A.   No.

2       Q.   Okay. Now, by the way, this is 1952. That's

3   a year before the 1953 document by Claude Teague that

4   you showed the jury, right?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   All right.

7       A.   Referencing some of the same studies.

8       Q.   And 40 years before the tobacco company

9   internal documents were released, right?

10       A.   Correct.

11        Q.   Now, you showed some clips from "See It Now"

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=539
12   on direct, right?

13       A.   I did.

14       Q.   All right. But you didn't show the whole

15   program, did you?

16       A.   No. It was two -- two segments that I

17   mentioned.

18       Q.   Two segments. And you just showed the part

19   that you wanted the jury to see in your presentation,

20   right?

21        A.   I selected two clips from it that were a

22   reflection of the industry's position, yes.

23       Q.   Okay. Now, "See It Now" was like 60 Minutes

24   of its day, right?

25       A.   Yes, sir. 3597

1        Q.   But it was even more popular because at that

2   time there were only three stations, right?

3       A.   That's right.

4       Q.   And the host of "See It Now" was Edward

5   Murrow?

6       A.   That's right.

7       Q.   And he was a very respected journalist?

8       A.   Yes, he was.

9       Q.   In fact, they even made a movie about him

10   with George Clooney, right --

11        A.   That's right.

12       Q.   --Good Night and Good Luck?

13       A.   Correct.

14       Q.   And that was his catch phrase when he signed

15   off. He would say, Good night and good luck?

16       A.   Yes.

17       Q.   Now, maybe this is what you were just

18   referring to. The "See It Now" program actually ran

19   two consecutive weeks of shows on smoking and health in

20    1955, right?

21        A.   No.

22       Q.   No?

23       A.   They weren't consecutive weeks.

24       Q.   Okay. Two segments?

25       A.   It ran two segments, different months. 3598

1        Q.   You are listening to every word, aren't you?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   All right. That's good. That was a "yes" or

4   "no."

5            The last week of May and first week of June

6    1955, right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   There were a number of scientists that

9   appeared on that show, right?

10       A.   Correct.

11        Q.   People like Dr. Wynder?

12       A.   That's right.

13       Q.   Dr. Hammond?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=540
14       A.   Correct.

15       Q.   Okay. And Dr. Cameron from the American

16   Cancer Society?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   Dr. Hess from the American Medical

19   Association?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Okay. Dr. Hammond, when he appeared on the

22   show, he was asked about whether the public should be

23   warned about the dangers of smoking, right?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   And you know what he said about that, right? 3599

1        A.   I do.

2       Q.   You have seen that part of the show, right?

3       A.   At trial, yes.

4       Q.   You took it into account when you were giving

5   your testimony, right?

6       A.   I have.

7            MR. WALKER: Okay. At this time, Your Honor,

8       I would ask to play the clip of Dr. Hammond

9       answering that question from the "See It Now"

10       show.

11             MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

12            THE COURT: All right.

13            MR. WALKER: Okay.

14            (A video clip was played for the jury as

15       follows:)

16            A SPEAKER: Good evening. This is "See It

17       Now" produced by the partnership of Friendly and

18       Murrow.

19            Tonight is the first of two reports on

20       cigarettes and lung cancer.

21             In 1952, Drs. Hammond and Horn of the

22       American Cancer Society began an extended study of

23       the smoking habits of American men. Here is

24       Dr. Hammond reporting on the results of the first

25       two years. 3600

1            DR. HAMMOND: It is now established in my

2       opinion beyond a reasonable doubt that cigarette

3       smoking greatly increases the probability of

4       developing lung cancer.

5            In my opinion, people should be warned of the

6       dangers, and they are being warned. What they

7       then want to do, whether they wish to smoke or

8       not, is their own business.

9            (Video clip concluded.)

10   BY MR. WALKER:

11        Q.   1955. People should be warned and are being

12   warned, right?

13       A.   That's what he said.

14       Q.   Whatever they do with that information is up

15   to them?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=541
16       A.   That's what he said. I don't dispute that.

17       Q.   Now, in the 1950s the Surgeon General also

18   spoke about whether Americans were aware of the risks

19   of smoking, right?

20       A.   In 1964?

21        Q.   In the 1950s.

22       A.   Leroy Burney, yes, at the Blatnik hearings.

23       Q.   Okay. I'll fill in the blanks for everybody

24   else.

25       A.   Sure. 3601

1        Q.   In 1957, Surgeon General Burney was asked

2   whether there should be a warning label on cigarettes,

3   right?

4       A.   I'm not --1 don't recall what specific

5   questions -- or all the details. I have read it but

6   just don't recall it all.

7       Q.   You know what I'm talking about, though,

8   right?

9       A.   Yeah.

10       Q.   Okay.

11        A.I remember his testimony in general.

12       Q.   But the bottom line is he said he didn't

13   think so, right? He didn't think there needed to be a

14   warning label on cigarettes?

15       A.   I'm not sure if that's what he said. I think

16   he thought that -- as I recall, he thought that the

17   American public, that they had -- when he was asked

18   whether the -- whether they were doing a good job, that

19   is, the Public Health Service educating the public, he

20   said he thought they were.

21        Q.   Now, you've been asked before whether he,

22   Surgeon General Burney, said he didn't think there

23   needed to be a warning. You have been asked that

24   question before, right?

25       A.   I don't remember. 3602

1        Q.   Lots of -- lots of cases you have testified

2   in, right?

3       A.   I was certainly shown the Blatnik report as I

4   did in this trial.

5       Q.   Well, let me ask you, You remember testifying

6   in a case called Gray, right?

7       A.   I don't recall, you know, the specificness of

8   the testimony regarding that.

9       Q.   All right. Are all the trials beginning to

10   run together in your mind?

11        A.   No, sir.

12       Q.   No? Okay.

13       A.   Do you want to show me the testimony on

14   that-

15       Q.   Yeah, I do, actually.

16       A.   -- so I can refresh my memory?

17            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=542
18            THE COURT: Yes.

19            (A document was shown to the witness).

20            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

21    BY MR. WALKER:

22       Q.   Sure. All right. So you certainly do

23   remember testifying in a case called Gray, right?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   Does January 2010 sound right to you? 3603

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   Okay. And you were in the witness box just

3   like you are today?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   Under oath?

6       A.   Yes, sir.

7       Q.   With a court reporter, right?

8       A.   Correct.

9       Q.   Okay. I want you to take a look at page

10    1149.

11        A.   Okay.

12       Q.   Do you see that?

13       A.   All right.

14            MR. WALKER: And I'll ask to display this

15       testimony for the jury to follow along, Your

16       Honor.

17            THE COURT: Well, first, ask him if he

18       recognizes it.

19   BY MR. WALKER:

20       Q.   Dr. Cummings, you are looking at your

21    testimony in black and white. Do you recognize that?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   Okay.

24       A.   I clarified the statement.

25            THE COURT: Well, before publishing it --3604

1            THE WITNESS: I do. I do. It refreshes my

2       memory.

3            MR. WALKER: May I ask him, Your Honor?

4            THE COURT: Yes.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6       Q.   This is page 1149 of your testimony in Gray.

7   Let's start at line 12.

8       A.   Sure.

9       Q.   And let's have 12 through 16, please, for

10   now.

11             All right. This is what I was just asking

12   you about, right?

13       A.   That's what you were just asking me about.

14       Q.   Dr. Burney was asked whether there should be

15   a warning label on cigarettes in 1957, correct?

16            And your answer was: Yes.

17            QUESTION: And he said that he didn't think

18   so, correct?

19            And your answer was: That's what he said.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=543
20            Do you remember that now?

21        A.   Yes. And that's not what exactly he said.

22   What he said was reflected in the next two sentences.

23       Q.   Was it wrong when you gave this testimony in

24   Gray?

25       A.   He was asked about whether the public needed 3605

1   to be communicated to about the health risks.

2       Q.   You told me what you think he said. I'm now

3   asking about what you said in Gray. Is this not right?

4   Did you --

5       A.   No. It's right in the sense that what I

6   heard the word -- or was asked the question about a

7   warning, I wasn't thinking about a warning label. I

8   was thinking about what I had read in his testimony,

9   which is whether the American public needed to be

10   educated about the health risks of smoking, not warning

11    labels.

12       Q.   Okay. So the answer to that question was no?

13       A.   The answer to the --

14       Q.   What you thought he was asking you, whether

15   the American public needed to be educated, the answer

16   to that question was no?

17       A.   It depends on how you interpret the question.

18       Q.   Well, it's your answer. I'm trying to

19   understand what you thought you were answering at the

20   time.

21        A.   I thought I was answering what I had said, is

22   that he answered the question. He thought the American

23   public was being communicated about -- to about the

24   health risks of smoking.

25       Q.   Well, let's talk about that, then. 3606

1        A.   Sure.

2       Q.   All right. Surgeon General Burney said that

3   he thought that the risks were being communicated to

4   the public through the excellent coverage of the press,

5   radio, and television, right?

6       A.   That's what he said.

7       Q.   All right. That's what you were remembering,

8   right?

9       A.   Yes, not that he was asked about a warning

10   label.

11        Q.   And you also--

12       A.   He wasn't.

13       Q.   Oh, I'm sorry.

14            You are also familiar with Dr. Heller, right?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   He was with the National Cancer Institute in

17   the same time frame, right?

18       A.   That's correct.

19       Q.   And he made similar comments in 1957, didn't

20   he?

21        A.   He did.

22       Q.   You're familiar with what he had to say about

23   this topic, aren't you?

24       A.   If you would like to show the testimony, I

25   would be happy to look at it. 3607

1        Q.   Well, let me -- let me tell you what -- let

2   me ask you if you said this. All right? It will save

3   some time.

4            Did he -- did Dr. Heller of the National

5   Cancer Institute say in 1957 -- '57 -- Newspapers,

6   radio, TV, and other media have done an excellent job

7   covering this problem and a very objective job. This

8   is an exceedingly valuable way of informing the public.

9            Did he say that?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   All right. Now, he was the director of

12   carcinogenesis -- the carcinogenesis division of the

13   National Cancer Institute, right?

14       A.   Yes, sir.

15       Q.   And Dr. Burney and Dr. Heller were both among

16   the top public health officials in the United States

17   charged with protecting the public health with respect

18   to smoking?

19       A.   Yes, they were.

20       Q.   Now, earlier, when I was asking about what

21    the Surgeon General said in 1957, you thought I was

22   asking about 1964.

23            Do you remember that mixup we had?

24       A.   Yes, sir.

25       Q.   All right. So let's talk -- let's move to 3608

1    1964.

2       A.   Okay.

3       Q.   In 1964, the Surgeon General issued the first

4   Surgeon General's report on smoking and health, right?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   And that one is dated January of 1964?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   All right. And among the conclusions in that

9   report, the Surgeon General determined that cigarette

10   smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men,

11    right?

12       A.   That's right.

13       Q.   And he concluded that it was likely a cause

14   of lung cancer in women, right?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   He concluded that cigarette smoking is the

17   most important of the causes of chronic bronchitis and

18   increases the risk of dying from chronic bronchitis and

19   emphysema, right?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Now, the release of that 1964 Surgeon

22   General's report with those conclusions was a major

23   historical event in this country, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=545
24       A.   I would agree with that.

25       Q.   It was literally front page news all over the 3609

1    country?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   Including right here in Florida?

4       A.   Many newspapers, that's true.

5       Q.   It was front page news in the Tampa Tribune?

6       A.   I don't know that for sure. I wouldn't

7   dispute it. It was in many newspapers.

8       Q.   Have you -- have you not researched Florida

9   newspapers to find out what they were carrying about

10   smoking and health?

11        A.   Sure. I've looked at Florida papers. I've

12   looked at papers from all over the country.

13       Q.   Well, surely you saw the Tampa Tribune

14   article that was reporting on the 1964 Surgeon

15   General's report?

16       A.   I'm sorry. I don't remember if I have or

17   not.

18       Q.   All right. Well, let me ask you about--

19   certainly, you don't doubt that the coverage was there,

20   do you?

21        A.   No.

22       Q.   You just don't -- you can't call it up in

23   your mind?

24       A.   That's right. There are a lot of cities.

25       Q.   Maybe I can help you out. 3610

1        A.   Sure.

2            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

3            (A document was shown to the witness).

4            THE WITNESS: Okay. Thank you.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6       Q.   Sure thing.

7            By the way, you said there were a lot of

8   cities, but you knew you were coming to testify in

9   Tampa, didn't you?

10       A.   I did.

11        Q.   Okay. You didn't review the Tampa Tribune

12   coverage of these issues before you came to give your

13   testimony?

14       A.   No. Because the coverage was pretty much the

15   same all around the country. And I'm familiar with the

16   coverage, so I did not make a special effort to look at

17   the Tampa paper.

18       Q.   Well, now that I've handed it to you, you've

19   certainly seen this before, right?

20       A.   I don't know if I've seen this or not, but

21    it -- you know, it appears to be an accurate

22   representation. I don't dispute it.

23       Q.   Well, you have seen probably this and

24   certainly others like it, reports of the Surgeon

25   General's report from this January 1964 time period,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=546
3611

1   right?

2       A.   Oh, yeah. I've got many of them.

3       Q.   Took them into account in giving your

4   testimony, right?

5       A.   Sure.

6            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I would ask to

7       display the January 12, 1964 Tampa Tribune article

8       at this time.

9            MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

10            THE COURT: All right.

11    BY MR. WALKER:

12       Q.   So I guess I was asking you, That -- you know

13   that's the Tampa Tribune, right?

14       A.   Yeah.

15       Q.   And article there, Result of 14-month blue

16   ribbon study, U.S. says cigarettes cause cancer.

17            Do you see that?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   So surely now you can agree with me that's

20   front page news --

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   --above the fold?

23       A.   Exactly.

24       Q.   Okay. And that date, January 12th, 1964,

25   that's the day right after the report was released, 3612

1   right?

2       A.   That's right.

3       Q.   Okay. Now, you talked a little bit about the

4   New York Times in your testimony earlier, right?

5       A.   I did.

6       Q.   All right. The New York Times also had this

7   story as front page news, right?

8       A.   They did.

9       Q.   The title there was, Cigarettes peril health,

10   U.S. report concludes, remedial action urged. Does

11    that sound familiar to you?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   Okay. And there were other articles even

14   within the New York Times newspaper that addressed

15   this, right?

16       A.   Sure.

17       Q.   Articles like, Cancer Link Cited?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   Smoking has also found important cause of

20   chronic bronchitis, right?

21        A.   Correct.

22       Q.   Okay. The 1964 Surgeon General's report was

23   also covered in all of the weekly news magazines,

24   right?

25       A.   Correct. 3613

1       Q.   Like U.S. News?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=547
2       A.   That's right.

3       Q.   Life magazine?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   Newsweek?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   A lot of those magazines even put it on their

8   covers, right?

9       A.   Some of them did, yes.

10            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

11             (A document was shown to the witness.)

12            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

13   BY MR. WALKER:

14       Q.   You're welcome.

15            All right. I've just handed you a copy of

16   U.S. News & World Report, right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   And this one is from 1964, isn't it?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   And you've seen this article before, have you

21    not?

22       A.   I have.

23       Q.   This isn't one that you showed the jury,

24   though, is it?

25       A.   No. 3614

1        Q.   Okay. I would ask to -- by the way, this is

2   an article that you took in account in giving

3   testimony, right?

4       A.   Correct.

5            MR. WALKER: All right. I would like to show

6       this U.S. News & World Report article, if I might.

7            MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

8            THE COURT: All right.

9   BY MR. WALKER:

10       Q.   All right. So that's the front of the

11    magazine, is it not?

12       A.   It is.

13       Q.   All right. Let's turn to the article. Let's

14   start with the title, actually. Here is the Latest on

15   Tobacco and Health. That was the title, right?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   Okay. And the bulk of this article is

18   talking about the 1964 Surgeon General's report, right?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   Okay. Let's start with just the left corner

21    there. Zoom in there.

22            The overall judgment of the committee was

23   stated in these words: Cigarette smoking is a health

24   hazard of sufficient importance in the United States to

25   warrant remedial action. 3615

1            Did I get that right?

2       A.   You did.

3       Q.   Let's look a little further down. And

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=548
4   there's a little subheading there. Do you see that?

5   It says, Linked With Death?

6       A.   Correct.

7       Q.   All right. And you are going to really have

8   to watch my reading here.

9            At the top of this list of, quote, principal

10   findings, quote, the committee stated, In view of the

11    continuing and mounting evidence, it is the judgment of

12   the committee that cigarette smoking contributes

13   substantially to mortality from certain specific

14   diseases and to the overall death rate. Heading the

15   committee's list of specific diseases due to cigarette

16   smoking is lung cancer. The report said, Cigarette

17   smoking is causally related to lung cancer in men. The

18   magnitude of the effect of cigarette smoking far

19   outweighs all other factors. The data for women,

20   though less extensive, point in the same direction.

21    Other lung ailments may also be caused or aggravated by

22   cigarettes, the report says, adding, Cigarette smoking

23   is the most important of the causes of chronic

24   bronchitis in the United States and increases the risk

25   of dying from chronic bronchitis and emphysema, 3616

1    congestion of the lungs. The notion that polluted air

2   or type of work is mainly responsible for lung and

3   breathing troubles is dismissed in the report. It

4   says, For the bulk of the population of the United

5   States, the relative importance of cigarette smoking as

6   a cause of chronic bronchopulmonary disease is much

7   greater than atmospheric pollution or occupational

8   exposures.

9            I know that was a mouthful, but did I read

10   that correctly?

11        A.   You did.

12       Q.   All right. And then in the next column, The

13   risk of developing lung cancer increases with the

14   duration of smoking and the number of cigarettes smoked

15   per day and is diminished by discontinuing smoking.

16            Did I say that right?

17       A.   You did.

18       Q.   All right. Now, you've agreed, have you not,

19   that the 1964 Surgeon General's report was one of the

20   most publicized public health stories ever in this

21    country?

22       A.   I agree.

23       Q.   In fact, publication of the 1964 Surgeon

24   General's report was so important that you called for

25   an issuance of a stamp by the U.S. Postal Service 3617

1    commemorating its 50th anniversary next year, right?

2       A.   That's true.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Can you read the next page,

4       please.

5            MR. WALKER: The next page?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=549
6            MR. UITERWYK: Under the rule of

7       completeness, Your Honor, not the whole page.

8       Experience -- starting with the paragraph

9        "experience."

10            THE COURT: I need to see the document unless

11        the parties can agree.

12            (At the bench)

13            MR. UITERWYK: I'm asking under the rule of

14       completeness that he read this paragraph,

15        "experience."

16            THE COURT: Mr. Walker, can you tell where

17       you left off?

18            MR. WALKER: On the first page, Your Honor.

19       That document is highlighted the same as what was

20       shown on the screen.

21             THE COURT: Right.

22            MR. WALKER: It's all talking about the 1964

23       findings.

24            THE COURT: And what do you want, on the next

25       page? 3618

1            MR. UITERWYK: Correct. Experience suggests,

2       Your Honor.

3            THE COURT: Where?

4            MR. UITERWYK: Right here. I'm sorry.

5       Experience suggests, right there.

6            MR. WALKER: That paragraph doesn't relate to

7       the findings at all. It's about consumption,

8       which I didn't read anything about consumption.

9            THE COURT: Can I read it to myself before I

10       make a ruling?

11             MR. UITERWYK: Yeah, Judge. I'm not

12       saying --1 thought he was talking, not me.

13            THE COURT: Okay.

14            MR. UITERWYK: You looked at the wrong

15       person.

16            THE COURT: All right. How much do you want

17       to read?

18            MR. UITERWYK: Just that paragraph, Judge.

19            THE COURT: Just the paragraph.

20            MR. UITERWYK: Starting with "experience" and

21        ending with "filter cigarettes."

22            MR. WALKER: It's not even on the same topic,

23       Judge.

24            THE COURT: Okay. The request is denied.

25            (In open court) 3619

1   BY MR. WALKER:

2       Q.   Now, so far we've looked at coverage of the

3   Surgeon General's 1964 report in, I guess, newspapers

4   and magazines, right?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   I'm just trying to orient us here. But at

7   the time that it came out, it was also covered on

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=550
8   television, right?

9       A.   That's right.

10       Q.   Okay. But there were only -- still only

11    three channels, right?

12       A.   CBS, ABC, and NBC.

13       Q.   No Internet in 1964, was there?

14       A.   That's probably a good thing.

15       Q.   Maybe so. There was no CNN or hundreds of

16   channels like we see now, just three?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   Okay. So the Surgeon General's report in

19    1964 was the lead story on the nightly news on all

20   three networks the night it came out, right?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   Now, you recall that in 1964 the news

23   programs at the time were only about 15 minutes long,

24   right?

25       A.   That's right. 3620

1        Q.   Okay. But for the publication of the 1964

2   Surgeon General's report, there were special editions

3   that were added, you know, on the order of a half hour

4   or so, right?

5       A.   That's right. They did half hour shows on

6   it.

7       Q.   And you've seen the Harry Reasoner report on

8   CBS from the night the 1964 Surgeon General's report

9   was released, right?

10       A.   Yes. I showed a brief clip of Howard Cullman

11    on that show.

12       Q.   And, once again, you showed a little bit of a

13   clip, but there was more that you didn't show, right?

14       A.   Sure. It was a half hour show.

15       Q.   Okay. The truth of the matter is the

16   overwhelming majority of that program, 75, 80, 90

17   percent of that program was devoted to telling the

18   American public about the results of the Surgeon

19   General's report, right?

20       A.   Appropriately, yes.

21        Q.   Okay. But you didn't show the 75, 80 to 90

22   percent of the report that did that, did you?

23       A.   No. I focused on what the committee said.

24       Q.   All right. But, certainly, you've seen the

25   rest of the show, and you took it into account in 3621

1    giving your testimony, right?

2       A.   Yes, I did.

3            MR. WALKER: All right. Your Honor, I would

4       like to show a clip from the same show that the

5       jury has not yet seen.

6            THE COURT: Has counsel seen it?

7            MR. UITERWYK: I'm not sure which portion of

8       the clip he's talking about, which portion of the

9       show he is talking about.

10            THE COURT: How long is it, approximately?

11             MR. WALKER: The clip?

12            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

13            MR. WALKER: I think it's just a minute or

14       two. Maybe a minute and a half.

15            THE COURT: All right. Mr. Uiterwyk, would

16       you take a look at it, please, over counsel --

17            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'm not going to

18       object. They can go ahead and play it.

19            THE COURT: All right. Go ahead.

20            (A video clip was played for the jury as

21        follows:)

22            A SPEAKER: This is a CBS News Extra on

23       smoking and health, the findings of the Surgeon

24       General's committee.

25            A SPEAKER: Almost from the moment that 3622

1        cigarettes were introduced they were attacked, but

2       the attacks took a new turn 10 years ago and

3       culminated in today's report by the Surgeon

4       General's committee. This, in summary, is what

5       the committee said. Cigarette smoking is a major

6       cause of lung cancer in men, and data on women

7       smokers points the same way. Cigarette smoking is

8       a significant cause of cancer of the larynx and

9       probably the most important cause of chronic

10       bronchitis. Cigarette smoking may be related to

11        other lung diseases. Male smokers have a much

12       higher death rate from heart disease, although

13       it's not proven that smoking is the cause.

14            On the question of filters, the committee

15       says there is no evidence that they do any good,

16       but it didn't exclude the possibility that an

17       effective filter might be developed.

18            In short, the committee says if you smoke

19       cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying

20       early. The sooner you start, the more you smoke,

21        the more you inhale, the worse your chances are.

22            A SPEAKER: The Surgeon General's committee

23       presented its report at a news conference in

24       Washington.

25            A SPEAKER: After a long and exhaustive 3623

1        deliberation, the committee has reached the

2       overall judgment that cigarette smoking is a

3       health hazard of sufficient importance to the

4       United States to warrant remedial actions. This

5       overall judgment was supported by many converging

6       lines of evidence, as well as by data indicating

7       that cigarette smoking is related to higher death

8       rates in a number of disease categories.

9            More specifically, the committee states on

10       page 61 of the report -- and I quote -- In view of

11        the continuing and mounting evidence from many

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=552
12       sources, it is the judgment of the committee that

13       cigarette smoking contributes substantially to

14       mortality from certain specific diseases and to

15       the overall death rate.

16            A SPEAKER: In this kind of a country, it

17       comes down to you whether you like it or not. No

18       one is going to forbid an adult to smoke, and it

19       is now quite clear that no one is going to tell

20       him it's good for him either. The decision is

21        his, the decision and the health that may depend

22       on it.

23            This is Harry Reasoner. Good night.

24            (Video clip concluded.)

25            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, they've actually 3624

1        cut a portion of his statement out --

2            THE COURT: All right.

3            MR. UITERWYK: --right before that.

4            THE COURT: On redirect you can ask him or --

5            MR. UITERWYK: I just wanted it played for

6       the rule of completeness, Your Honor, but they --

7            THE COURT: Do you have it? Do you have it

8       now?

9            MR. UITERWYK: No. They have it.

10            MR. PHILIPSON: We have it too.

11             MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I don't know what

12       they want to play.

13            THE COURT: Okay. Well, I need to see it

14       then. Do you want to look at it now or on

15       redirect?

16            MR. UITERWYK: I would rather do it now, Your

17       Honor, because --

18            THE COURT: Okay. I need to see it.

19            MR. UITERWYK: -- of the context of that

20       particular setting.

21             THE COURT: I need to see it. I need to see

22       it first. Do you have the transcript of it?

23            MR. UITERWYK: Do I? No. But we have,

24       actually, the clip.

25            THE COURT: How long is the portion that you 3625

1        want to be played?

2            MR. UITERWYK: It's about a minute.

3            MR. BIGGER: It's less than a minute.

4            MR. UITERWYK: And the problem is, Your

5       Honor, they played the first part --

6            THE COURT: I understand. I understand your

7       argument, but I can't make a ruling on it without

8       seeing it.

9            MR. UITERWYK: Right.

10            THE COURT: Do you know the part that they

11        want to show -- they want --

12            MR. WALKER: I don't, Judge. I would like to

13       move on with my cross.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=553
14            THE COURT: Well, I know. I'm not going to

15       break now. If you feel it relevant, we'll deal

16       with it on redirect. I'm not going to break now.

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q.   Dr. Cummings, the Surgeon General's findings

19   from the 1964 report, we've now talked about the

20   coverage in newspapers, magazines and on TV. Those

21    findings were never hidden from public view, were they?

22       A.   The Surgeon General's report?

23       Q.   The Surgeon General's findings, they weren't

24   hidden from the public, were they?

25       A.   No. 3626

1        Q.   Now, the first health warnings started to

2   appear on cigarette packages in 1966, right?

3       A.   That's right, April.

4       Q.   And Congress told the companies through

5   legislation exactly what the warnings had to say,

6   right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   And Congress told the companies through

9   legislation where on the package the warnings had to be

10   placed, right?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   And how big the print should be?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   And so starting in 1966, there were warnings

15   on every pack of cigarettes sold in America?

16       A.   Yes. Beginning in April.

17       Q.   Beginning in April. And that would include

18   Mrs. Loyd's cigarettes, right?

19       A.   True.

20       Q.   All right. Now, the first warning label that

21    came out starting in 1966 --

22            MR. WALKER: And, Your Honor, I would like to

23       display, if I might, the warning label.

24   BY MR. WALKER:

25       Q.   You know what the language is; right? 3627

1        A.   I do.

2            MR. WALKER: I would like to display the 1966

3       warning.

4            THE COURT: Go ahead.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6       Q.   All right. Caution: Cigarette smoking may

7   be hazardous to your health, right?

8       A.   Yeah.

9       Q.   Okay. And you don't know anything about

10   Mrs. Loyd's level of awareness of the risks of smoking

11    at the time these warnings were placed on the pack, do

12   you?

13       A.   No, not precisely.

14       Q.   All right. Now, you -- you testified earlier

15   about a Federal Trade Commission report from 1967. Do

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=554
16   you remember that?

17       A.   I do.

18       Q.   And one of the things that you stated was

19   that the report concluded that the -- that warning that

20   we just looked at was not effective. That was one of

21    the conclusions from the report that you talked about,

22   right?

23       A.   Yes.

24       Q.   Okay. But you also know that within four

25   years, four years of that first warning label, between 3628

1    1966 and 1970, 13 million smokers had quit smoking,

2   right?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   Okay. In fact, that was when the largest

5   number of people in history had ever quit smoking in

6   any four-year period of time, right?

7       A.   That's true. I can explain why if you would

8   like me to.

9       Q.   Let's just stick with my questions for now.

10       A.   Sure.

11        Q.   I'm sure you could go on for days about what

12   you want to talk about.

13       A.   It would be very brief, but --

14       Q.   And then in 1969 the United States Congress

15   decided to strengthen the warning label on cigarettes,

16   right?

17       A.   They did.

18       Q.   Okay. And the warning was changed to, The

19   Surgeon General has determined that cigarette smoking

20   is dangerous to your health. Right?

21        A.   That's right.

22       Q.   You have seen that warning before, right?

23       A.   I have.

24            MR. WALKER: I'd like to display that.

25   BY MR. WALKER: 3629

1        Q.   That's the warnings we were just talking

2   about, right?

3       A.   Correct.

4       Q.   1970 to 1984?

5       A.   On cigarette packs in 1970 and then in '72 on

6   advertisements in addition to the packs.

7       Q.   Right. And once again, Congress specified

8   through its legislation how big the warning had to be?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   And where the warnings should be placed on

11    the package?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   And the type face or the print of the

14   warning, right?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   And the language of the warning?

17       A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=555
18       Q.   And as you have just mentioned, by 1972 the

19   warnings started -- had to be -- had to appear in

20   cigarette ads, right?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   So that goes to 1984. Then effective in 1985

23   Congress mandated four rotating warnings, right?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   And they specifically said that smoking 3630

1    causes lung cancer and emphysema, right? That was one

2   of them?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   By the way, there is no evidence that you've

5   seen anywhere in this record that Mrs. Loyd tried to

6   quit smoking in 1985, is there?

7       A.   No. We don't know one way or the other.

8       Q.   Okay. But those are the same warnings that

9   are on the packs today, right?

10       A.   Yes, sir.

11        Q.   That series of rotating warnings?

12       A.   That's right. They have not changed.

13       Q.   Okay. So from 1966 all the way up until

14   Mrs. Loyd quit in 1993, there was a warning label on

15   every single package of cigarettes that Mrs. Loyd

16   smoked, right?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   Now, speaking of what's on the side of the

19   package, I want to ask you, you showed the jury a

20   document about levulinic acid.

21        A.   That's correct.

22       Q.   Okay. And you are familiar with that, right?

23       A.   Yes.

24       Q.   And because you are familiar with it -- and

25   you were showing that document in the context of 3631

1    cigarettes, right? Nicotine and levulinic acid?

2       A.   I was showing --1 was showing that document

3   in the context of the research that Reynolds was doing.

4       Q.   Okay. But because you are familiar with that

5   acid, you know that levulinic acid is in other consumer

6   products like beer, right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Bread?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   Roasted coffee?

11        A.   Right.

12       Q.   Okay. Now, if you go to Starbucks and you

13   buy a cup of roasted coffee, the cup of coffee doesn't

14   say this coffee contains levulinic acid, does it?

15       A.   I don't know if Starbucks contains levulinic

16   acid or not.

17       Q.   Have you seen levulinic acid on the side of

18   any coffee you've ever bought?

19       A.   I don't recall.

20       Q.   Okay. Now, you are also familiar with public

21    service announcements related to smoking, right?

22       A.   lam.

23       Q.   And you talked about how celebrities and

24   other famous people were used in advertising at

25   different points in time, right? 3632

1        A.   That's right.

2       Q.   Okay. But many famous people in the 1960s

3   were also making public service announcements, right?

4       A.   Right, as part of the Fairness Doctrine

5   period.

6       Q.   Well, one of those was William Talman, right?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   Now, William Talman was an actor who was on a

9   TV show called Perry Mason, right?

10       A.   That's right. He was the DA that always lost

11    the cases.

12       Q.   He was the guy that always lost, right?

13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   Kind of like the Washington Generals? Same

15   concept, right?

16            Okay. You know that William Talman?

17            THE COURT: His name was Hamilton Burger,

18       also known as Ham Burger.

19            MR. WALKER: Probably tough to win with a

20       name like that, Judge.

21    BY MR. WALKER:

22       Q.   All right. You've seen the public service

23   announcements that William Talman did on the subject of

24   cigarette smoking, right?

25       A.   Sure. 3633

1        Q.   And the clip that I wanted to show is the

2   same clip you've seen many times before, right?

3       A.   Yes, probably.

4       Q.   You took it into account when reaching your

5   opinions and giving your testimony, right?

6       A.   Yes. It was a very effective public service

7   campaign.

8            MR. WALKER: All right. At this time, Your

9       Honor, I would like to play the William Talman

10       public service announcement.

11             THE COURT: All right.

12            (A video clip was played for the jury as

13       follows:)

14            MR. TALMAN: This is the house we live in.

15       That's Billy. He's pretty handy to have around.

16       Steve, home from college. Barbie, looking after

17       her brother Tim. Debbie, who will soon graduate

18       from high school. Susan, our youngest. And my

19       wife Peggy, who looks after all of us.

20            And that's me, Will Talman, with a friend of

21        mine whom you might recognize.

22            You know, I didn't really mind losing those

23       courtroom battles. But I'm in a battle right now

24       I don't want to lose at all, because if I lose it,

25       it means losing my wife and those kids you just 3634

1        met. I've got lung cancer.

2            So take some advice about smoking and losing

3       from someone who has been doing both for years.

4       If you don't smoke, don't start. If you do smoke,

5       quit. Don't be a loser.

7   BY MR. WALKER:

8       Q.   Now, we were just talking about Perry Mason.

9   But another popular television show was the Mary Tyler

10   Moore Show, right?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   And one of the actors on that show was named

13   Ed Asner, right?

14       A.   That's right.

15       Q.   And Mr. Asner also did public service

16   announcements about the health risks of cigarette

17   smoking, didn't he?

18       A.   In the 1980s, yeah. In the 1980s.

19       Q.   You've seen some of those public service

20   announcements, have you not?

21        A.   Sure.

22       Q.   And you took them into account when giving

23   your testimony in this case?

24       A.   Yes.

25            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, at this time I would 3635

1        like to display the Ed Asner Great American

2       Smokeout clip.

3            THE COURT: All right.

4            (A video clip was played for the jury as

5       follows:)

6            MR. ASNER: Hi. I'm Ed Asner. Last year the

7       American Cancer Society asked me to stop smoking

8       just for a day. I said, Okay, but just for a day.

9       That was November 16th. Well, I got through it.

10       So I tried it again on November 17th and 18th and

11        19th, and you know, to this day I still haven't

12       had a cigarette.

13            Why don't you try it. Join the Great

14       American Smokeout this November 15. Tell yourself

15       it's just for a day.

16            (The video clip was concluded.)

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q.   Now, the Great American Smokeout, that was a

19   campaign by the American Cancer Society, right?

20       A.   That's right. Created in the mid 1970s.

21        Q.   And the idea of the campaign was that people

22   like Ed Asner would say to the public, Let's all quit

23   smoking for one day and see if we can keep it going,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=558
24   right?

25       A.   That was the concept. 3636

1        Q.   And then the Great American Smokeout became

2   an annual tradition, picked up all around the nation

3   because of its early successes, right?

4       A.   1977 onward.

5       Q.   Now, by the way, in the 1970s, when the Great

6   American Smokeout was going on, there's no evidence in

7   this case from anyone in any of the dozen or more

8   depositions that you read, no evidence that Mrs. Loyd

9   was trying to quit smoking, is there?

10       A.   No evidence either way.

11        Q.   All right. Now, another popular TV show was

12   Dallas, right?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   And one of the main stars on Dallas was Larry

15   Hagman, right?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   He played J.R. Ewing on that television show?

18       A.   Correct.

19       Q.   And he was doing public service announcements

20   warning people about the health risks of smoking and

21    encouraging people to quit also, right?

22       A.   That's right.

23       Q.   And you've seen a number of the public

24   service announcements that Larry Hagman did on this

25   topic, have you not? 3637

1        A.   I have.

2            MR. WALKER: At this time, Your Honor, I

3       would like to show the Larry Hagman public service

4       announcement.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Can we get a time frame on

6       that, please?

7            MR. WALKER:  1981.

8            THE COURT: Okay.

9            (A video clip was played for the jury as

10       follows:)

11             MR. HAGMAN: Do you know what would happen if

12       you stopped smoking cigarettes right now, right

13       this minute? I'll tell you what would happen.

14       Your lungs would immediately start to repair

15       themselves. Even if you have been smoking for

16       years and years, once you stop assaulting your

17       lungs, it's only a matter of time before they are

18       healthy and in the pink again. Now, you have

19       every reason in the world to stop smoking

20       cigarettes, because now you know what will happen

21        if you do. And what will happen if you don't.

22            (The video clip was concluded.)

24       Q.   You are also familiar with Yul Brynner, are

25   you not?

3638

1        A.   I am.

2       Q.   He was a celebrity famous for the King and I,

3   right?

4       A.   That's right.

5       Q.   And he also did a public service announcement

6   for the American Cancer Society, right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   You mentioned a few times when you were

9   looking at some of the earlier public service

10   announcements, you mentioned about the Fairness

11    Doctrine. Do you remember saying that?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   But Yul Brynner did public service

14   announcements for the American Cancer Society even

15   after the Fairness Doctrine came to an end, right?

16       A.   Yes. I believe this was in the eighties.

17       Q.   Okay. And you know the ad that I am -- that

18   we're about to look at, right?

19       A.   Sure. I'm familiar with the Yul Brynner ad.

20       Q.   And you took it into consideration in giving

21    your testimony, didn't you?

22       A.   Sure.

23            MR. WALKER: Okay. At this time I would like

24       to display the Yul Brynner public service

25       announcement from the 1980s. 3639

1            MR. UITERWYK: When in 1980?

2            THE COURT: What period of time, sir?

3            MR. WALKER: It's in the 1980s, Your Honor.

4            THE COURT: All right.

5            THE WITNESS: What was the actual date?

6            MR. UITERWYK: The year is what I want.

7   BY MR. WALKER:

8       Q.   Oh. Do you know the year?

9       A.   Not offhand.

10       Q.   You are just able to give us a decade, kind

11    of the way you did with some of the things you showed,

12   right?

13       A.   That's right. I thought it was in the

14   eighties, late eighties, but I'm guessing at that.

15       Q.   I think you are probably right, but I won't

16   hazard a guess either. But it's in the 1980s, Your

17   Honor.

18            THE COURT: Okay.

19            (A video clip was played for the jury as

20       follows:)

21             A SPEAKER: Ladies and gentlemen, the late

22       Yul Brynner.

23            MR. BRYNNER: I really wanted to make a

24       commercial when I discovered that I was that sick

25       and my time was so limited, to make a commercial 3640

1       that says simply, Now that I am gone, I tell you,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=560
2       don't smoke. Whatever you do, just don't smoke.

3       If I could take back that smoking, we wouldn't be

4       talking about any cancer. I'm convinced of that.

5            (The video clip was concluded.)

6   BY MR. WALKER:

7       Q.   All right. Now, you are familiar with Daniel

8   Horn?

9       A.   Sure.

10       Q.   Now, Daniel Horn was not a celebrity, was he?

11        A.   Well, it depends on --

12       Q.   Not in the same sense as Yul Brynner and

13   Larry Hagman, right?

14       A.   He was an important public health official.

15       Q.   He wasn't an actor?

16       A.   No. He wasn't a public figure, I would say,

17   in the same ways as the actors we have seen.

18       Q.   But he was a very well respected public

19   health figure?

20       A.   That's true.

21        Q.   And he was a co-author of some of the studies

22   that you talked about or that you looked at with Dr.

23   Hammond, right?

24       A.   Hammond and Horn, that's right.

25       Q.   Now, Dr. Horn had a tremendous amount of 3641

1    expertise as a doctor in the field of smoking and

2   health, right?

3       A.   Sure.

4       Q.   He was the director of the National

5   Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health in 1968, was he

6   not?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   Okay. And that office was established after

9   the Surgeon General's report, to issue all of the later

10   Surgeon General's reports that came after it?

11        A.   That's correct.

12       Q.   All right. And in your research on -- and

13   working on these cases, you know what Dr. Horn had to

14   say about the question of awareness in 1968, do you

15   not?

16       A.   I've reviewed many of his statements on

17   smoking and health.

18       Q.   And you are familiar with the statement he

19   made about standing on a rooftop, aren't you?

20       A.   Sure. I have been shown that in court. I

21    think I was in Syracuse, New York, a quote in the

22   paper, and I've seen other quotes that he's given.

23       Q.   And you took that in account when you were

24   giving your testimony, right?

25       A.   I have taken it all into account. 3642

1        Q.   Okay. I would like to display the Daniel

2   Horn quote from 1969, please. It's a demonstrative.

3            THE COURT: All right.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=561
4   BY MR. WALKER:

5       Q.   All right. This is Daniel Horn of the

6   National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health in 1968.

7            You could stand on a rooftop and shout

8   "smoking is dangerous" at the top of your lungs and you

9   would not be telling anyone anything they did not

10   already know.

11             Did I read that correctly?

12       A.   You did.

13       Q.   All right. Now, we can take that down.

14            Now, the prevalence of cigarette smoking,

15   that is the percentage of the population that are

16   current smokers, has steadily declined since the 19

17   since the late 1960s forward, right?

18       A.   That's right. It peaked in around 1966-'67

19   period.

20       Q.   And during that same period of time, the

21    number of people who had quit smoking steadily went up

22   during that whole period of time, right?

23       A.   That's right.

24       Q.   And the Surgeon General estimates that by

25    1965, 17.6 million U.S. smokers had quit, right? 3643

1        A.   1965?

2       Q.   1965.

3       A.   I'm not familiar with that one.

4       Q.   All right. Well, tell me if this sounds

5   familiar to you. In 1965, there were about 17.6

6   million adult former smokers. Ring a bell?

7       A.   No, not offhand.

8       Q.   Okay. You are not telling me that I am

9   wrong, you just don't remember it?

10       A.   That's right.

11        Q.   Okay. Now, looking at the time period

12   between 1964 and 1979, this country experienced the

13   highest rate of quitting smoking ever in this country;

14   is that right?

15       A.   Yes, I would agree with that.

16       Q.   And in 1979 the Surgeon General reported that

17   30 million smokers had quit smoking over that 15-year

18   period from 1964 to 1979, correct?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   That's an average of 2 million Americans

21    quitting smoking every single year over that 15-year

22   period, right?

23       A.   That's right.

24       Q.   In fact, the Surgeon General described that

25   as an era of unprecedented quitting, right? 3644

1        A.   In the '79 report, that's true.

2       Q.   Now, that's one of the same periods of time

3   that you told this jury that the defendants and others

4   were making statements about that it wasn't proven that

5   cigarette smoking caused disease, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=562
6       A.   That's true also. That's what they were

7   saying.

8       Q.   And it's still almost 20 years before you say

9   tobacco company internal documents were released,

10   right?

11        A.   Those were, yes.

12       Q.   All right. Now, during your direct

13   examination, you showed the jury a slide with a variety

14   of cessation aids. Do you remember that?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   That's the slide. Yours was a little

17   prettier than my black-and-white copy. But that's your

18   slide, right?

19       A.   Sure.

20       Q.   And so you have Chantix on there, it looks

21    like Wellbutrin and some others, right?

22       A.   That's right.

23       Q.   Now, of those quit aids, not a single quit

24   aid on that chart was available during that 15-year

25   period between 1964 and 1979, right? 3645

1        A.   That's true.

2       Q.   Okay. But nevertheless, that's the same time

3   period when 30 million smokers had quit, right? '64 to

4   '79.

5       A.   That's right. Were classified as former

6   smokers.

7       Q.   And you said before that there -- today there

8   are about 60 million people who have quit smoking in

9   the United States; is that correct?

10       A.   Yes.

11             MR. WALKER: Your Honor, this is right at a

12       point where I will be going into a new area. This

13       is a good time.

14            THE COURT: Okay. Give me a minute.

15            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

16            THE COURT: Counsel approach, please?

17            (At the bench.)

18            THE COURT: I appreciate your letting me know

19       that you are going into a new area. About how

20       long do you think this new area will be?

21             MR. WALKER: I think it's about 30 or 40

22       minutes, Judge.

23            THE COURT: All right.

24            MR. WALKER: That's why I wasn't sure.

25            THE COURT: We'd better break. Okay. I'm 3646

1        going to break for the day.

2            MR. PEDROSA: Okay.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Okay. Thank you, Judge.

4            THE COURT: Thank you.

5            (In open court.)

6            THE COURT: All right. Members of the jury,

7       we're going to call it a day. It's about 10

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=563
8       minutes to 5:00, and counsel has advised me that

9       he wants to move into a new area of

10       cross-examination, but that area in and of itself

11        would probably run another 30 minutes or so, and I

12       don't want to keep you that along after 5 o'clock.

13            So we'll be in recess until tomorrow morning

14       at nine o'clock. Please bear in mind, keep in

15       mind my instructions. Keep an open mind. Do not

16       discuss this case or communicate about this case

17       in any manner, shape, method or means. Do not

18       allow the case to be discussed in your presence or

19       discuss it amongst yourselves.

20            We will be in recess until 9:00 a.m. tomorrow

21        morning. Thank you and have a good night.

22            (The jury retired from the courtroom at

23       4:50 p.m.)

24            THE COURT: All right. Dr. Cummings, we'll

25       see you tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m. 3647

1            THE WITNESS: Okay.

2            (The witness retired from the stand.)

3            THE COURT: Mr. Walker, regarding the

4       question of what Mrs. Loyd's brother said their

5       mother said, I've determined that that's hearsay

6       and I'm sustaining the objection.

7            MR. WALKER: I understand your ruling, Judge.

8            THE COURT: All right. We'll be in recess

9       until --

10            Mr. Mayfield?

11             MR. MAYFIELD: Yes, Your Honor. And along

12       that same vein, there are several areas of

13       testimony tomorrow through Jack Smith, who I think

14       we now understand will take the stand at some

15       point tomorrow.

16            This is just another short -- and when I say

17       short, two or three pages at most -- bench brief

18       that's been filed today that kind of covers

19       several of the topics that we have gone over

20       today. It may even, I dare say, cause you to

21        reflect further on the ruling you have just made.

22       But if not, I understand. But we wanted to hand

23       that up so you have it in anticipation of

24       tomorrow's testimony.

25            THE COURT: Okay. That's fine. 3648

1            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I just want to ask

2       again, because I think this morning Mr. Uiterwyk

3       said he might tell us --

4            THE COURT: Right.

5            MR. WALKER: He might have new information

6       this afternoon.

7            THE COURT: Right.

8            MR. WALKER: Is it Jack and Amber, and the

9       other possibilities are what?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=564
10            MR. UITERWYK: It depends on when you think

11        you are going to be done. Any estimate?

12            MR. WALKER: I don't know. But I mean --

13            MR. UITERWYK: Are you going to be all

14       morning?

15            MR. WALKER: If you assume lunch.

16            THE COURT: You should be through with

17       cross-examination no later than lunch?

18            MR. WALKER: No, Your Honor. I think it may

19       go later than that. But in order to assist

20       Mr. Uiterwyk and give him more a reasonable

21        estimate of who they might call, I could finish as

22       early as lunch, but I expect it will be a little

23       bit after that.

24            THE COURT: Okay. What's the latest?

25            You may be seated if you wish. 3649

1            What's the latest you reasonably believe that

2       you will be through with cross-examination?

3            MR. WALKER: My guess would be the

4       midafternoon break, Your Honor.

5            THE COURT: Okay. All right. So-

6            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, on that estimate, I

7       don't believe Mr. Walker is factoring in my time.

8       I think he's just talking about him.

9            THE COURT: Okay. How much time do you

10       think?

11             MR. PEDROSA: I'm still where I told you last

12       week. I think it's about an hour for me.

13       Obviously, if I have to impeach a lot, that gets

14       longer. But I think it's about an hour.

15            THE COURT: Okay. So let's say from - I

16       hate to use the words worst or best case, but a

17       worst case scenario in terms of having to fill the

18       time, assume for the moment, it doesn't sound like

19       cross-examination will be completed, under any

20       circumstance, prior to lunch, with both parties

21        crossing? Is that a fair statement?

22            MR. WALKER: That's fair, Judge.

23            MR. PEDROSA: I would agree with that.

24            THE COURT: So assuming, assuming that to be

25       true, that even if they finished at noon, which is 3650

1        highly unlikely, that you needed witnesses for the

2       afternoon, who would you have?

3            MR. UITERWYK: And I've got redirect,

4       obviously, too, Judge.

5            THE COURT: Correct.

6            MR. UITERWYK: We would have Jack and Amber.

7            MR. TRENTALANGE: Jack Smith and Amber

8       Norris.

9            MR. UITERWYK: Sorry, Judge. I did it again.

10            MR. BIGGER: You know Jack and Amber? They

11        are pals.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=565
12            MR. UITERWYK: I thought by now you would

13       know them.

14            MR. TRENTALANGE: Judge, is that -

15            THE COURT: That will fill up the afternoon.

16            MR. UITERWYK: And if not, we still have the

17       Heimann deposition that they are going to go

18       designating tomorrow, but not very long from

19       either perspective.

20            THE COURT: Okay.

21             MR. UITERWYK: The Court could probably rule

22       within 10, 15 minutes about any objections we may

23       have.

24            THE COURT: All right. Does that answer your

25       question, Mr. Walker? 3651

1            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor. Thank you.

2            MR. TRENTALANGE: Your Honor, I have a

3       serious question. I understand your rule about

4       surnames --

5            THE COURT: Right.

6            MR. TRENTALANGE: --of parties. When I am

7       addressing Mr. Smith -- Mrs. Loyd, frankly has had

8       several different last names during her life --

9       may I refer -- when I am addressing Mr. Smith, may

10       I say, Your sister, Jacqueline? Is that okay? Or

11        is that -- does that run afoul? Do I have to say

12       your sister --

13            THE COURT: I think it would be - yes,

14       except that why don't you -- whenever you --

15            A preliminary statement may be in order in

16       terms of I'm going to refer to her as Jacqueline

17       Loyd, because that's how the papers have been

18       filed. So if I say Jacqueline Loyd, you know who

19       I am talking about, your sister?

20            MR. TRENTALANGE: Right. I understand. If

21        it just comes out--

22            THE COURT: If comes out, yeah, I understand

23       that. I understand that. Yeah. I mean, the

24       whole purpose, as I explained, as I understand it,

25       is not so much familiarity but more in terms of 3652

1        the general respect that we have for everybody

2       here.

3            MR. TRENTALANGE: Right. Right.

4            THE COURT: And we don't treat people

5       differently by race or gender calling them first

6       names and other people by their surnames. So I

7       try to enforce it even handedly. But yeah, I

8       understand that.

9            MR. BIGGER: Judge, in light of Mr. Walker's

10       indication of the length of his cross remaining,

11        and Mr. Pedrosa as well, I have the phone number

12       of the judge in Fort Myers. I think they are

13       expecting Dr. Cummings potentially tomorrow

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=566
14       afternoon. It sounds like that's obviously not

15       going to be case.

16            If you wouldn't mind, could I give you this

17       number and perhaps you could communicate with that

18       judge, just to make sure --

19            THE COURT: I don't -- you know, this is

20       going to sound worse than --1 don't mean it in

21        this sense.

22            MR. BIGGER: Yes, sir.

23            THE COURT: But I don't know why I need to

24       get involved in terms of somebody's litigation

25       strategy. I mean, he's clearly testifying. He's 3653

1        still on the witness stand. I don't know what I

2       could communicate. It's not that I mind, I just

3       don't know why I need to get involved.

4            MR. BIGGER: If I may. The judge down

5       there -- and this is just -- again, I'm relating

6       my understanding.

7            THE COURT: Right. I understand.

8            MR. BIGGER: I have not been in Ft. Myers.

9            THE COURT: I understand.

10            MR. BIGGER: From my understanding in

11        communicating with plaintiffs counsel as I have

12       been requested to do, trying to help facilitate,

13       the judge in Ft. Myers has been informed that the

14       problem is that due to the length of the direct of

15       the witness that the plaintiff retained. And so I

16       don't want there to be some suggestion that

17       somehow the plaintiffs have created this problem

18       and, therefore, the judge is going to punish that

19       plaintiff. Because, obviously, Your Honor is

20       here, you saw the direct went substantially faster

21        once we got those document issues resolved.

22            THE COURT: Well, that gives me even more

23       pause in terms of --

24            The situation is what it is. I mean, it's a

25       complicated subject. He's testified about matters 3654

1        that have occurred, at least on direct, more than

2       50 years, and on cross, hundreds of years. And

3       so --

4            MR. BIGGER: I understand. I understand what

5       Your Honor is saying.

6            THE COURT: Certainly if the federal district

7       court judge has any questions, I'm happy to

8       address those questions. But for me to make a

9       call initially when the witness is on the stand, I

10       hesitate to get involved.

11             MR. BIGGER: Right. I understand what you

12       are saying, and I'll pass that on.

13            THE COURT: Given the number of cases that

14       Dr. Cummings testifies in, it's a problem that he

15       may encounter from time to time, as any expert

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=567
16       does who does a significant part of his work in

17       terms of litigation.

18            So I'm happy to talk to the district court

19       judge. But unless he has an inquiry directly to

20       me, then I hesitate to get involved.

21             MR. BIGGER: And you had previously asked

22       last week for his phone number, and that's why I

23       gave it to Your Honor.

24            THE COURT: I appreciate that. And I did,

25       but I thought a little bit more about it, and I 3655

1        realized that I don't need to interject myself in

2       that unless he has a question.

3            MR. BIGGER: No problem. I'll relate that,

4       Your Honor.

5            THE COURT: Okay. All right. Thank you very

6       much. Have a good night.

7            MR. PEDROSA: Thank you, Your Honor.

8            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Your Honor.

20            THE JURORS WHO RESPONDED: Good morning.

21                   KENNETH MICHAEL CUMMINGS, Ph.D.,

22   plaintiffs witness herein, being previously duly sworn

23   on oath, testified as follows:

24                   CROSS-EXAMINATION (CONTINUED)

25   BY MR. WALKER: 3662

1        Q.   Good morning, Dr. Cummings.

2       A.   Good morning.

3       Q.   So we spent some time yesterday talking about a

4   number of topics. Today what I want to move to is what

5   you discussed with Mr. Uiterwyk. And he referred to it

6   as the 50-year coverup. I think you both used that

7   term, I don't know how many times, in your examination.

8   Remember that?

9       A.   Sure.

10       Q.   Okay. So first of all, you believe that the

11    coverup involving Reynolds and other tobacco companies

12   began in 1953, the conspiracy, right?

13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   Okay. And you've admitted previously that

15   anyone who began smoking before 1953 was not influenced

16   in their decision to begin smoking by that conspiracy,

17   right?

18       A.   That's right.

19       Q.   And that would include Mrs. Loyd, right?

20       A.   That's right.

21        Q.   Because she started smoking before 1953, right?

22       A.   Based on the evidence I've seen, that's

23   correct.

24       Q.   All right. Now, you talked a little bit about

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=572
25   the epidemiological studies from the early 1950s in your 3663

1    direct examination, right?

2       A.   And before that, yes.

3       Q.   And before that.

4            Now, those studies caught the attention of some

5   people in the public health community, right?

6       A.   They were written by people in the public

7   health community.

8       Q.   And some people in the public health community

9   called on the tobacco industry to fund research in

10   smoking and health, right?

11        A.   I believe that's true.

12       Q.   Okay. And one of those groups was the American

13   College of Surgeons, right?

14       A.   Yes.

15       Q.   At their convention in Chicago, they called on

16   the tobacco industry to fund research, right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   And that was reported in the New York Times,

19   right?

20       A.   What year?

21        Q.   1953.

22       A.   Okay.

23       Q.   Sound familiar?

24       A.   Um-

25       Q.   Let me help you out. 3664

1        A.   Sure. I have to look at the date.

2            MR. WALKER: May I approach?

3            THE COURT: Yes.

4            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

5            MR. WALKER: Sure.

6   BY MR. WALKER:

7       Q.   All right, sir. I have just handed you a

8   New York Times article dated October 5th, 1953, right?

9       A.   Right.

10       Q.   The title is "Cigarette Makers Prodded on

11    Cancer."

12            You see that?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   You know what I'm talking about now, right?

15       A.   Yes, I do.

16       Q.   You've seen this article before?

17       A.   I'm not sure I've seen it before.

18       Q.   But you've seen this coverage before, right?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   You took it into account in giving your

21    opinions?

22       A.   Certainly.

23            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I would like to

24       display this New York Times article from 1953.

25            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor. 3665

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=573
1            THE COURT: All right.

2   BY MR. WALKER:

3       Q.   All right. So there is -- right at the top,

4   this is the New York Times, one of those newspapers you

5   talked about in your examination, right?

6       A.   Right.

7       Q.   And the title, "Cigarette Makers Prodded on

8   Cancer." Let's just look at the first part there that's

9   highlighted.

10            "The major"  this is October 4th, Chicago.

11             "The major cigarette companies were challenged

12   today to conduct research projects to prove or disprove

13   recent medical suggestion that cigarette smoking leads

14   to lung cancer."

15            Did I read that right?

16       A.   You did.

17       Q.   And we won't read the whole article. Let's

18   just look down a bit further.

19             "In these circumstances, they declared, 'It is

20   the clear responsibility of the cigarette manufacturers

21    to finance the research necessary to prove or disprove

22   the point.'"

23            Did I read that right?

24       A.   You did.

25       Q.   Okay. And we were just talking about the 3666

1   New York Times, but you're also familiar with the

2   New England Journal of Medicine, right?

3       A.   I am.

4       Q.   And that's a prestigious medical journal,

5   certainly today, right?

6       A.   Very prestigious, yes.

7       Q.   And it was also in the 1950s, right?

8       A.   Yes, it was.

9       Q.   Okay. Now, the New England Journal of Medicine

10   also published an editorial asking the companies to fund

11    research, right?

12       A.   They did.

13       Q.   And you've seen that editorial also, haven't

14   you?

15       A.   I have.

16            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

17            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

18            MR. WALKER: Sure.

19   BY MR. WALKER:

20       Q.   So what I've just handed you is the New England

21    Journal of Medicine editorial from 1953 that we were

22   just talking about, right?

23       A.   Yes.

24       Q.   And you've seen that before?

25       A.   Yes. 3667

1        Q.   Taken it into account in giving your testimony?

2       A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=574
3            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I would like to

4       display this New England Journal of Medicine.

5            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

6            THE COURT: All right.

7   BY MR. WALKER:

8       Q.   All right. So as I've just mentioned,

9   New England Journal of Medicine, it looks like July,

10   December 19 

11             MR. WALKER: Can we zoom in on the --

12            THE WITNESS: September 10th, 1953.

13            MR. WALKER: Okay. September 10th, 1953.

14       We'll go with that.

15            If we could turn to page 466 of this document.

16       Maybe just give me the ELMO.

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q.   Okay. New England Journal of Medicine. It is

19   the same article that was just on the screen. It just

20   so happens that I have it tabbed. We can get to it a

21    little faster this way.

22            All right. This is right near the end of this

23   particular editorial.  "The situation affords unusual

24   opportunities for the vast tobacco interests to support

25   impartial researches into the effects that their 3668

1   products may have on the human health."

2            Did I read that right?

3       A.   You did.

4       Q.   Okay. Now, the companies first met together in

5   New York on December 14th, 1953, right?

6       A.   That's right.

7       Q.   And that ultimately led to the formation of

8   TIRC, right?

9       A.   Correct.

10       Q.   And the publishing of the "Frank Statement"?

11        A.   Correct.

12       Q.   Now, I think you even explained on direct that

13   Hill & Knowlton, that you talked a lot about, was not at

14   the meeting on the 14th?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   All right. Now, you showed a number of

17   Hill & Knowlton memos, but there was one that you didn't

18   show that I want to ask you about, and it was written by

19   a man named Bert Goss.

20            You know who he was, right?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   He was an employee of Hill & Knowlton?

23       A.   That's right.

24       Q.   The executive vice president at the time,

25   right? 3669

1        A.   That's right.

2       Q.   Second only to John Hill?

3       A.   He was a senior executive. There were a number

4   of them at Hill & Knowlton.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=575
5       Q.   All right. Now, when John Hill retired,

6   Mr. Goss actually became the president of

7   Hill & Knowlton, right?

8       A.   That's true.

9            MR. WALKER: All right. May I approach,

10       Your Honor?

11    THE COURT: Yes.

12 BY MR. WALKER:

13       Q.   Now, help me out, Dr. Cummings. Did you show

14   this one or didn't you show this one? I'm reliably

15   informed that you may actually have already shown this.

16       A.   And you've gotten reliable information. We did

17   show it.

18       Q.   All right. I usually do. All right. Thanks.

19            So this is the memo that's already in evidence.

20            MR. WALKER: Do we have this one? Okay.

21             MS. MCKINNIS: Yes.

22            MR. WALKER: We could show this.

23   BY MR. WALKER:

24       Q.   This is the memo that's recounting the

25   December 15th meeting at the Plaza Hotel, right? 3670

1        A.   That's true.

2       Q.   Okay. And it says that the presidents of

3   leading tobacco companies were there, right?

4       A.   That's right.

5       Q.   Okay. Now, if you look at the last page, by

6   the way --

7            MR. WALKER: Do we have that?

8   BY MR. WALKER:

9       Q.   -- it actually lists who was present at the

10   meeting, right?

11        A.   That's right.

12       Q.   And there is actually no evidence from this

13   memo that anyone from Reynolds was actually present at

14   this meeting, is there?

15       A.   No. I think I pointed out that they were all

16   there on the 14th, except for Liggett, and then some of

17   them stayed over for the meeting on the 15th, but not

18   Reynolds.

19       Q.   Not Reynolds. Okay.

20            All right. Now, if we could turn back to

21   page 2. Under Section 3, the heading there is "The

22   Industry's Position."

23            Do you see that?

24       A.   Yes, I do.

25       Q.   All right. So the very first sentence, "The 3671

1   industry is strongly convinced that there is no sound

2   scientific basis for the charges that have been made."

3            Did I read that right?

4       A.   You did.

5       Q.   Now, that sounds pretty similar to what they

6   said publicly in the "Frank Statement" when they said,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=576
7   "We believe the products we make are not injurious to

8   health," right?

9       A.   Correct.

10       Q.   All right. And then in the next paragraph, it

11    says -- where it's highlighted -- make it easier for you

12   and me and the jury -- they point out that, "The

13   National Cancer Institute of the United States Public

14   Health Administration, which is a government agency and

15   supported by Congressional appropriations, has

16   officially refuted the tie-up between cigarette smoking

17   and cancer."

18            Did I read that correctly?

19       A.   You did read it correctly.

20       Q.   And that was true at the time, right?

21        A.   There wasn't unanimity of opinion at that time.

22       Q.   That was a true statement at the time, right?

23       A.   I don't think they had taken an official

24   stance. There were some in the government who were

25   scientists who didn't believe a link had been proven. 3672

1        Q.   It was true at the time that the U.S. Public

2   Health Administration, a government agency, supported by

3   Congressional appropriation, had officially reviewed the

4   tie-up between cigarette smoking -- refuted the tie-up

5   between cigarette smoking and cancer, correct?

6       A.   No. I think that's a misinterpretation of the

7   evidence at the time.

8       Q.   Okay. But you've been asked that question

9   before and you've testified that that's correct; have

10   you not?

11        A.   I testified that this was written as it is.

12       Q.   Okay. You remember testifying in a case called

13    "Webb," don't you?

14       A.   Sure.

15       Q.   All right. That was what, a couple of years

16   ago?

17       A.   I don't know. I'd have to look at the date on

18   the transcript.

19       Q.   Fair enough.

20            But when you testified in Webb, you were in the

21    witness box just like you are today?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   Under oath?

24       A.   Yes.

25       Q.   With a court reporter? 3673

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   All right. Let's take a look at how you

3   answered this question then.

4       A.   Sure.

5            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

6            THE COURT: Sure.

7            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

8            MR. WALKER: Sure.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=577
9   BY MR. WALKER:

10       Q.   All right. This is your testimony -- a

11    transcript of your testimony from the Webb case on

12   November 5th, 2010.

13            You see that?

14       A.   Yes.

15       Q.   If you would, turn to page 1191, please.

16       A.   Okay. I'm there.

17       Q.   You're there.

18            And we could start at line -- let's look at

19   lines 8 through 16.

20            You have it in front of you, right?

21        A.   I do.

22       Q.   All right. So the first question is reading

23   from the document, just like I was reading from the

24   document, right?

25       A.   That's right. 3674

1        Q.   So it says "Question."

2            And then if we go to the next paragraph of this

3   memo, it says, "They point out that the National Cancer

4   Institute of the U.S. Public Health Administration,

5   which is a government agency, and supported by

6   Congressional appropriations, have officially reviewed

7   the tie-up between cigarette smoking and cancer,

8   correct?"

9            And then your answer was "Correct," right?

10       A.   Yes, they did point that out.

11        Q.   Now, it says "reviewed" there, but the quote

12   actually is "refuted," right? We just read that in the

13   document, right?

14       A.   Right. The question is asking me whether they

15   pointed that out, and they did state that in their memo.

16       Q.   Okay.

17       A.   It wasn't a true statement.

18       Q.   And then the next--Dr. Cummings, try to stay

19   with me. All right?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   The next question is, "And that was true at

22   that time, correct?" And your answer was, "That was

23   true at that time." Right?

24       A.   They pointed that out, yes.

25       Q.   Okay. All right. Now, the NCI study that 3675

1   they're referring to was an article by Dr. Sadowski,

2   Gilliam, and Cornfield of the National Cancer Institute,

3   right?

4       A.   What article are you referring to?

5       Q.   The article that was referred to in the memo we

6   were just looking at.

7       A.   I'm not sure they mentioned that article in the

8   memo.

9       Q.   I'm not asking you what they mentioned. I'm

10   asking you if that's the article they were referring to.

11   A.I have no idea.

12   Q. You have no idea?

13   A. No.

14   Q. Okay.

15       A.   There is no mention of that article in the

16   memo.

17       Q.   All right. Let's stick with your Webb

18   testimony then. The same page, the very next line,

19   starting at line 17 through 21.

20       A.   Okay.

21        Q.   "Question: And the NCI study, the National

22   Cancer" --

23       A.   What page?

24       Q.   The same page, line 17.

25             "The National Cancer Institute study that they 3676

1   referred to was in the Journal of the National Cancer

2   Institute by Drs. Sadowski, Gilliam, and Cornfield of

3   the NCI, correct?"

4            Your answer, "Answer: That's right."

5            Did I read that right?

6       A.   You did.

7       Q.   So you didn't have any question about this when

8   you were asked about it in Webb, did you?

9       A.   No, because the article was brought up as the

10   next exhibit.

11        Q.   You think -- you think that an exhibit was

12   brought up between this question and the last question?

13       A.   They-

14       Q.   Let's look -- let's look at lines 8 through 21.

15   Take a look at it.

16       A.   I'm looking at the next --

17       Q.   And the question in Webb was whether the

18   statement was true. And the very next question was

19   whether the NCI study that was referred to was this

20   article by Sadowski, Gilliam, and Cornfield.

21             Do you see that?

22       A.   I do.

23       Q.   There is no exhibit brought up in between

24   there, is there?

25       A.   Not in between, no. 3677

1        Q.   Okay. All right. Now, the article that we're

2   talking about, you are familiar with it, right? The

3   article by Sadowski, Gilliam, and Cornfield.

4       A.   I am.

5       Q.   It was published in the Journal of the National

6   Cancer Institute, right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Okay. And then and now, that's a prestigious

9   publication, right?

10       A.   Sure.

11        Q.   You're familiar with the conclusions of that

12   study, aren't you?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=579
13       A.   lam.

14       Q.   All right. And that was a study where they

15   said there was an association between smoking and lung

16   cancer, but more work needs to be done to establish it

17   as a real association, right?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   Okay. Let's have a look now. Let's have a

20   look at the exhibit.

21             MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

22            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

23            MR. WALKER: Sure.

24   BY MR. WALKER:

25       Q.   All right. So this is the article from the 3678

1   Journal of the National Cancer Institute that we were

2   just talking about, right?

3       A.   Correct.

4       Q.   The one you said you're familiar with and have

5   seen before, right?

6       A.   Yes, sir.

7       Q.   And you took this into account in giving your

8   testimony?

9       A.   I did.

10       Q.   All right. I'd like to show this document from

11    the NCI journal.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'm just looking at

13       it for the first time.

14            THE COURT: Sir?

15            MR. UITERWYK: It's a, I don't know, 30-page

16       document. I'm just seeing it for the first time.

17            THE COURT: Okay. Well, do you have an

18       objection?

19            MR. UITERWYK: I don't know yet, Your Honor,

20       because I haven't seen it before today. They

21        haven't given it to me.

22            May we approach, Your Honor?

23            (At the bench.)

24            MR. UITERWYK: First of all, I'm not sure for

25       what purpose that he's going to be using it. If 3679

1        he's going to be using it for -- to impeach the

2       doctor, then fine, let him ask the question whether

3       he considered it to be authoritative.

4            Because what this is, Your Honor, it's the type

5       of document is statistical association between

6       smoking and carcinoma of the lung. And he

7       hasn't laid any predicate for the offering of this

8       particular document.

9            MR. WALKER: I have laid a predicate, Judge.

10       This is the document that was referred to in the

11        other document that's already in evidence that he

12       talked about in his direct examination.

13            They've argued that the companies entered into

14       this 50-year coverup knowing that there really was

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=580
15       an association between cigarette smoking and lung

16       cancer. And this document that was referred to in

17       the same internal document that he showed the jury

18       says otherwise. So it goes to the issue of

19       reprehensibility and particularly --

20            MR. UITERWYK: Goes to the issue of what?

21             MR. WALKER: Reprehensibility. It shows that

22       these men were --

23            THE COURT: What is it you want to publish to

24       the jury?

25            MR. WALKER: It's actually tabbed and 3680

1        highlighted in this copy, Your Honor.

2            MR. UITERWYK: What pages?

3            MR. WALKER: This is evidence about the state

4       of mind of the so-called -- of the people who were

5       supposedly knowingly misleading the public. This is

6       the information that they had available to them as

7       directly referenced in the document that he showed

8       the jury and that this witness said he has seen and

9       considered in giving his opinions.

10            THE COURT: Let me understand your objection.

11        I'm not sure I understand what your objection is.

12            MR. UITERWYK: Is he offering it for the truth

13       of the matter stated in the document, then it's a

14       hearsay document, number one. And number two, he

15       hasn't established a foundation for the purpose of

16       using it for this particular witness.

17            THE COURT: Well, he's saying -- he hasn't laid

18       the predicate in terms of Dr. Cummings taking this

19       article into account in rendering his opinion. It's

20       not coming into evidence, you're using it for

21        impeachment?

22            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

23            MR. UITERWYK: He hasn't -- impeached him

24       regarding what? Because he hasn't set up any of

25       basis --3681

1            MR. WALKER: Regarding what -

2            THE COURT: Regarding the 50-year conspiracy,

3       his opinion that there was a 50-year conspiracy.

4            MR. WALKER: Also -

5            MR. UITERWYK: It's already been given.

6       There's already been a finding in Engle that there

7       was a 50-year conspiracy. There was a finding in

8       Engle that there was a conspiracy, there was a fraud

9       and a fraud to conceal.

10            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor-

11             MR. WALKER: Nevertheless, he put on proof,

12       presumably not to -- either he's reproving the

13       finding, which allows me to respond to that

14       evidence, or he went into that evidence because he

15       believes it's relevant to reprehensibility. In

16       either case, I'm entitled to respond to show the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=581
17       other side of it.

18            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, we actually had a

19       motion in All Cases seeking to preclude plaintiffs

20       from reproving the 50-year conspiracy, and that

21        motion was denied. And we obviously objected to the

22       whole process of reproving all that. But if the

23       plaintiffs are allowed to do it, we have to be

24       allowed to respond to it.

25            In addition, as far as the hearsay objection, 3682

1        it's an ancient document. There's no hearsay

2       objection. He --

3            THE COURT: Say what document?

4            MR. PEDROSA: It's an ancient document. It's

5       from 1953. There's no hearsay objection.

6            MR. WALKER: I'm not admitting the document

7       anyway.

8            THE COURT: No, I understand.

9            MR. WALKER: And there's no --

10            MR. UITERWYK: Admitting and reviewing it,

11        there's no -- really a distinction without a

12       difference, sir.

13            MR. WALKER: There's no Engle finding on

14       reprehensibility.

15            MR. UITERWYK: And for the record, we also --

16       and to be fair, we have used -- went into the

17       coverup to show how it -- what it affects addicted

18       smokers like Jackie Loyd. That was the significant

19       reason for doing it.

20            THE COURT: I'm going to overrule your

21        objection.

22            MR. WALKER: Thank you.

23            (End of bench conference.)

24   BY MR. WALKER:

25       Q.   All right. So, Dr. Cummings, this is the 3683

1   Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the same one

2   that we were just talking about, right?

3       A.   Correct.

4       Q.   Okay. I want to go to page 12 -- let's see --

5    1255 of this article.

6       A.   Okay.

7       Q.   This is the article that was -- you testified

8   was referenced in the -- excuse me -- in the

9   Hill & Knowlton document from earlier. Tell me if I

10   read this right.

11             "It would therefore appear that though the

12   association between cigarette smoking and lung cancer

13   seems real, the significance of this association remains

14   unestablished."

15            Did I read that correctly?

16       A.   You read it correctly.

17       Q.   Okay. Let's look at the next page. Right at

18   the end before the references. Tell me if I get this

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=582
19   right or wrong.

20            "Considerations are presented which lead to the

21    conclusion that the etiological significance of these

22   associations remains unestablished."

23            Did I read that right?

24       A.   You did.

25       Q.   And etiological means cause, right? 3684

1        A.   Correct.

2       Q.   Okay. Now, if we go back to the Bert Goss memo

3   we were just talking about --

4            MR. WALKER: Can we pull that up again? All

5       right.

6   BY MR. WALKER:

7       Q.   If we move to Section 4 --

8       A.   Okay.

9       Q.    the companies were asked a number of

10   questions by John Hill himself, right?

11        A.   Correct.

12       Q.   All right. And the first question asked was

13   whether the companies would organize and openly sponsor

14   public relations. And it says, "The companies replied

15   that they had no desire to set up a smoke screen or,

16   quote, front, end quote, type of organization."

17            Did I read that correctly?

18       A.   Correct.

19       Q.   Okay. Now, we've been talking about this

20   public relations firm called Hill & Knowlton. It's

21    common for institutions that want to communicate with

22   the public to hire public relations consultants, right?

23       A.   Sure.

24       Q.   For example, the American Cancer Society uses a

25   public relations consultant, doesn't it? 3685

1        A.   They probably do.

2       Q.   And even where you work at Roswell Park, it has

3   its own PR department, doesn't it?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   Now, you showed the jury a forwarding memo from

6   Hill & Knowlton, right?

7       A.   Correct.

8       Q.   And you said that was an internal

9   Hill & Knowlton document, right?

10       A.   Yes, sir.

11        Q.   Okay. There is no evidence that it was ever

12   sent to any tobacco company, is there?

13       A.   There's no evidence either way.

14       Q.   There's an absence of evidence about whether it

15   was sent to the company?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   Okay. There's also no evidence of who it went

18   to at Hill & Knowlton, is there?

19       A.   It's not to and from. There's not a cover note

20   to it, although it was written to the executives who

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=583
21    were handling their new client, the tobacco industry.

22       Q.   Okay. But there's no evidence of who precisely

23   it went to at Hill & Knowlton, is there?

24       A.   There's no list of who it was sent to.

25       Q.   You've testified that the author is Ed Dawkins, 3686

1   right?

2       A.   That's right.

3       Q.   And you say that just because there are three

4   initials at the back of the memo, right?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   Okay. Now, Ed Dawkins' specific position at

7   Hill & Knowlton in 1953 was what?

8       A.   He was an employee of Hill & Knowlton.

9       Q.   I'm not asking you if he was an employee. Do

10   you know what his exact position was there?

11        A.   No.

12       Q.   Okay. Do you know how long he was at

13   Hill & Knowlton?

14       A.   No, not --1 don't have his itinerary of his

15   career.

16       Q.   All right. You don't know his position and you

17   don't know how long he worked there?

18       A.   No, I don't.

19       Q.   The only thing you know about the authors of

20   this memo is that they were working at Hill & Knowlton

21    at some point in the early 1950s, right?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   As far as you know, these could be people who

24   were just out of school or could have been there for

25   years, right; you just don't know one way or the other? 3687

1        A.   I don't know one way or the other.

2            These were in the files, the archive of John

3   Hill, who was the owner of the company.

4       Q.   Be that as it may, there's a lack of evidence

5   about what their positions were, how long they were,

6   what their positions were?

7       A.   The memo speaks for itself.

8       Q.   Well, you talked about a lot of these memos.

9   You said you've got these collections. You've got all

10   these documents. You've written about all these

11    documents. I'm just asking you --

12       A.   Sure.

13       Q.   --is there a lack of evidence about the people

14   who wrote this memo?

15       A.   There's -

16            MR. UITERWYK: Objection.

17            THE WITNESS: - no dispute-

18            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, argumentative.

19            THE COURT: Overruled.

20            THE WITNESS: There's no dispute it was written

21       by Ed Dawkins who was an employee at

22       Hill & Knowlton.

23   BY MR. WALKER:

24       Q.   You understand that's not what I'm asking you,

25   right? We know -- you've already said it's an employee. 3688

1            What I'm asking you, sir, you told this jury

2   about all the documents you reviewed and how you've

3   written about them and how you have this expertise.

4            The fact of the matter is, there's a complete

5   lack of evidence about what Mr. Dawkins' position was,

6   how long he had worked there, and what his credentials

7   were; isn't that true, sir?

8       A.   No.

9       Q.   That's not true?

10       A.   No. I've seen he worked for Hill & Knowlton.

11    I just don't know how long he worked for them. And I

12   don't know what his latest position was at the time he

13   wrote the memo.

14       Q.   Okay. Well, let's look at page -- let's see.

15   Just a moment.

16            All right. So let's look at the second -- now

17   that I have the right document, let's look at page --

18            MR. WALKER: Can we have that on the screen?

19       This is in evidence.

20            THE WITNESS: You want to provide me a copy.

21             MR. WALKER: Sure, if you need one.

22            THE WITNESS: Sure.

23            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

24            THE COURT: Yes.

25            THE WITNESS: Thank you. 3689

1   BY MR. WALKER:

2       Q.   All right. So page 2.

3            Now, you showed the jury, if I recall

4   correctly, this page talking about the, quote-unquote,

5   research directors, right?

6       A.   That's correct.

7       Q.   And we have one of the people saying, "It's

8   fortunate that this is a habit they can't break."

9            You showed that part, right?

10       A.   That's right.

11        Q.   Another says, "Wouldn't it be wonderful to be

12   first out with a cigarette that didn't cause cancer,"

13   right?

14       A.   That's right.

15       Q.   Okay. And then somebody else says, "What would

16   happen if they smoked one fewer cigarettes a day,"

17   right?

18       A.   Correct.

19       Q.   All right. We have no idea who said what, do

20   we?

21        A.   Well, we know that they interviewed four

22   research directors, because that's referenced in the

23   December 15th meeting.

24       Q.   My question to you, sir, is, we have no idea --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=585
25   or maybe I should say, you have no idea which person 3690

1    said which thing, do you?

2       A.   No, we don't know which research director said

3   which thing.

4       Q.   There's just no evidence about that?

5       A.   No, they did not name them.

6       Q.   The author of this document didn't share any of

7   the names, right?

8       A.   No.

9       Q.   Okay. You also don't know, because there's no

10   evidence, why there are quotation marks around the term

11    "research directors," right?

12       A.   I don't know.

13       Q.   Okay. The sum total of what we know is

14   contained in this memo, right?

15       A.   No, sir.

16       Q.   It's not?

17       A.   No.

18       Q.   Okay. Do you remember being asked this

19   question before and giving a different answer?

20       A.   No.

21        Q.   Okay. Let me help you out.

22            You do remember testifying in a case called

23   Gray, right?

24       A.   Sure.

25       Q.   That's because we've already looked at some of 3691

1   your testimony from Gray, haven't we?

2       A.   Sure.

3       Q.   Okay. Let's look at some more.

4            MR. WALKER: May I approach?

5            THE COURT: Yes.

6            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

7            MR. WALKER: Sure.

8   BY MR. WALKER:

9       Q.   All right. So in Gray, you were testifying

10   from the witness box under oath and with a court

11    reporter, right?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   Okay. I want you to turn, if you would,

14   please, to page -- let's see -- 1227.

15       A.   Okay. I'm there.

16       Q.   You got there faster than I did, but we have it

17   on the screen. Let's look at lines 23 through 25.

18       A.   Okay.

19       Q.   "Question: But, again, the sum total of what

20   we know is contained in this memo, right?

21             "Answer" --

22            MR. UITERWYK: Where are you reading from?

23            MR. WALKER: Lines 23 through 25.

24   BY MR. WALKER:

25       Q.   "Answer: The memo, yes, speaks for itself." 3692

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=586
1            That was what your testimony was, right?

2            MR. UITERWYK: Objection. Move to strike,

3       Your Honor. That's not what he said.

4            THE COURT: Overruled.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6       Q.   That was your testimony, right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Okay. Thank you.

9            Now, so far, the two memos that we've been

10   looking at, they're internal Hill & Knowlton memos,

11    right?

12       A.   That's correct.

13       Q.   There is no evidence that they were routed to

14   any of the tobacco companies or that they were copied or

15   anything like that, right?

16       A.   No, that's not true, because there's minutes of

17   meetings of the executives with Hill & Knowlton

18   throughout the December that have -- who attended those

19   meetings, included the presidents of the companies.

20       Q.   Okay. You're still holding your Gray testimony

21    there, right?

22       A.   Sure.

23       Q.   All right. Let's look at -- take a look at

24   page 1228 of your testimony, sworn testimony in the Gray

25   case. Page 1228, starting at -- let's look at lines 9 3693

1   through 12.

2            "Question: The companies never saw this stuff?

3   There's no indication that it was routed to them or that

4   they were copied on it or anything like that?

5             "Answer: That's true."

6            Did I read that correctly?

7       A.   You did.

8       Q.   Okay. Now, the companies never had an

9   opportunity to respond to any of this information in

10   these Hill & Knowlton memos that we've been looking at,

11    correct?

12       A.   I don't understand your question.

13       Q.   They never had an opportunity to respond to the

14   information in the memos that we were just looking at,

15   correct?

16       A.   Yeah, they did.

17       Q.   They did?

18       A.   Yes, they did.

19       Q.   You still have your Gray testimony in front of

20   you?

21        A.   Sure.

22       Q.   Same page, 1228. Let's look --

23            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, may we approach?

24       I'm going to object.

25            THE COURT: Okay. 3694

1             (At the bench.)

2            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor --

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=587
3            THE COURT: Just need to state your objection

4       because I can't have --1 can't have the lawyers

5       approaching every objection if we're going to get

6       through it.

7            MR. UITERWYK: I didn't this time, Your Honor,

8       because there are a couple of things.

9            THE COURT: Okay.

10            THE UITERWYK: The problem, what he's doing is,

11        he's not allowing him to explain an answer. He's

12       instructed him just to answer the question yes or

13       no.

14            THE COURT: Okay.

15            MR. UITERWYK: For instance, this particular

16       impeachment here says they never had an opportunity

17       to respond to any of this, which is different than

18       the question that he asked him at the time. So

19       he -- he's not asked to clarify. There's no

20       clarification, because he hasn't had chance to

21        explain.

22            And what -- Your Honor, I think it's improper

23       impeachment, number one. I think it's collateral

24       impeachment too. I really don't think this is as

25       to -- to the issues in this case, it's not pertinent 3695

1        impeachment.

2            THE COURT: Okay. I think he's asked him the

3       same question. I think it's proper impeachment.

4            He's asked him a question, and then the witness

5       gives an answer, and then Mr. Walker asked him the

6       same question from a prior deposition, and he gives

7       a different answer. So why isn't that --

8            MR. UITERWYK: It was not the same question,

9       Your Honor.

10            THE COURT: Okay. Well, I -- to me, I thought

11        it was.

12            MR. UITERWYK: No, he didn't use the word -- he

13       used the word -- in the other question, he didn't

14       say the word to respond to any of this.

15            MR. WALKER: Seven lines earlier than this that

16       they're talking about is the Hill & Knowlton

17       documents. I can read the whole thing if I need to.

18            THE COURT: Okay. Your objection is overruled.

19            (In open court.)

20   BY MR. WALKER:

21        Q.   Okay. So let's take a look at -- let's see --

22   lines 13 through 15. Or better yet, let's look at line

23   6 through 15. Let's make absolutely sure we know what

24   we're talking about.

25            Are you with me, Doctor? 3696

1        A.   I'm with you, and I can explain my answer, if

2   you'd like.

3       Q.   Well, first, let's make sure --

4       A.   Sure.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=588
5       Q.   Let's see what you said before. Okay?

6            Line 6. "And that's a good point. These are

7   internal Hill & Knowlton memos?

8            "Answer: That's right.

9            "Question: The companies never saw this stuff?

10   There's no indication that it was routed to them or they

11    were copied on it or anything like that?

12            "Answer: That's true.

13             "Question: They never had an opportunity to

14   respond to any of this?

15             "Answer: That's right."

16            That's what your testimony was, right?

17       A.   I can explain.

18            MR. UITERWYK: He can, Your Honor.

19            THE WITNESS: Would you like me to explain?

20   BY MR. WALKER:

21        Q.   First, I want you to acknowledge that your

22   testimony then is not the same as what you said today.

23       A.   No.

24       Q.   Okay. You think that when I asked you that

25   question, they never had an opportunity to respond, you 3697

1   think you gave the same answer today that you gave then?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   Okay. We're going to move on.

4            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, he can explain.

5            THE COURT: You can ask him on redirect.

6   BY MR. WALKER:

7       Q.   All right. Now, the -- I'm going to go ahead

8   and ask you this next question. And if we need to look

9   at what you said before, we will.

10            The so-called research directors never had an

11    opportunity to clarify what they meant if that's, in

12   fact, what they said; true or false?

13       A.   It's true.

14       Q.   Okay.

15       A.   We don't know.

16       Q.   All right. Now, you talked about how the

17   companies all met at the Plaza Hotel in December 1953,

18   right?

19       A.   That's correct.

20       Q.   All right. Now, these meetings at the Plaza

21    Hotel didn't stay secret for very long, did they?

22       A.   Well, they came out with an ad. I don't know

23   about the meetings at the Plaza Hotel you're referring

24   to.

25       Q.   Well, you've talked quite a bit about the 3698

1   New York Times. The fact of the matter is, the New York

2   Times actually reported on them within a week, didn't

3   they?

4       A.   That's true.

5       Q.   All right.

6            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=589
7            THE COURT: Yes.

8            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

9            MR. WALKER: Sure.

10   BY MR. WALKER:

11        Q.   All right. Now, I've just handed you a

12   New York Times article dated January of 1954. Looks

13   like January 2nd.

14            Do you see that?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   And this is an article you've seen before,

17   right?

18       A.   I have.

19       Q.   And this article isn't from some secret company

20   document; this is a public newspaper article, right?

21        A.   It says "Secret Meetings."

22       Q.   I'm asking you if this article is from a secret

23   publication, the New York Times?

24       A.   It's from the New York Times. I'll refer to

25   that. 3699

1        Q.   All right. And you took this into account in

2   giving your testimony; did you not?

3       A.   Sure.

4            MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I'd like to

5       display this New York Times article from

6       January 2nd, 1954.

7            THE COURT: Any objection?

8            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

9            THE COURT: All right.

10   BY MR. WALKER:

11        Q.   Let's have the title first. "Industry Confers

12   to Aid Cigarettes."

13            And then let's look at the first paragraph. "A

14   plan for concerted" --

15            Dr. Cummings, you're smiling. Is that -- did

16   you want me to read some more of what's under the title?

17       A.   Read whatever you like.

18       Q.   Okay. All right. Thanks.

19             "A plan for a concerted action to clear

20   cigarettes of guilt for causing lung cancer is being

21    mapped by the major cigarette manufacturers at

22   highly-secret meetings now going on at a midtown hotel

23   daily."

24            Did I read that right?

25       A.   You did. 3700

1        Q.   Okay. Let's skip down a couple of paragraphs.

2            MR. UITERWYK: Before that, Your Honor, if we

3       could read the subtitle above it, please.

4   BY MR. WALKER:

5       Q.   Well, that's what I was just asking about.

6   Happy to.

9   Cancer Charges."

10            Did I read that right?

11        A.   You did.

12       Q.   Okay. So this is an article about what was

13   going on at those meetings, right?

14       A.   Correct.

15       Q.   Okay. Further down, "While none of the

16   companies would talk or even concede that such meetings

17   were going on, it was known that the manufacturers are

18   shaping plans for a joint effort involving heavy

19   expenditures for impartial research."

20            Did I read that correctly?

21        A.   You did.

22       Q.   All right. Now, before -- now, the industry

23   actually contacted the Department of Justice in late

24    1953 before the "Frank Statement" to discuss the

25   formation of the TIRC, right? 3701

1        A.   Correct.

2       Q.   You're familiar with that, aren't you?

3       A.   Stanley Barnes, yes.

4       Q.   Stanley Barnes. Okay.

5            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

6            THE COURT: Yes.

7            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

8            MR. WALKER: Sure.

9   BY MR. WALKER:

10       Q.   Now, before I even gave you the document, you

11    mentioned Stanley Barnes, right?

12       A.   Correct.

13       Q.   And the document that I've just handed you is a

14   document that was sent to Judge Stanley Barnes, right?

15       A.   Correct.

16       Q.   Now, that was the Assistant Attorney General,

17   right?

18       A.   That's right.

19       Q.   Not Surgeon General. This time we're actually

20   talking about the Assistant Attorney General, right?

21        A.   Department of Justice.

22       Q.   Okay. The Attorney General is the most senior

23   law enforcement officer in the entire nation; is that

24   right?

25       A.   Yes. 3702

1        Q.   Now, the date of the letter that I handed you

2   is January 26, 1954, right?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   Same month as the "Frank Statement," correct?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   Now, you've seen this document before, right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Taken it into account in giving your testimony

9   and opinions, right?

10       A.   Yes.

11             MR. WALKER: At this time, Your Honor, I would

12       like to publish this January 26, 1954 letter to

13       Stanley Barnes.

14            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

15            THE COURT: All right.

16   BY MR. WALKER:

17       Q.   All right. So right at the top there we see

18   the date. We see it's addressed to the Honorable

19   Stanley N. Barnes, Assistant Attorney General, in

20   Washington, D.C. and let's start at the beginning of

21    the first paragraph. Tell me if I have this right.

22            "Dear Judge Barnes, I wish to acknowledge

23   receipt of your letter of January 21 in which you

24   request me, as Chairman of the Tobacco Industry Research

25   Committee, to furnish you details of the plans of our 3703

1    committee."

2            Next paragraph.

3             "I appreciate the interest you are taking in

4   this matter, and I wish to assure you of our desire to

5   keep you informed. Of course, the committee is in its

6   initial and formative stage at the present time and is

7   charting its future course and formulating its plans and

8   functions. We have already made an initial statement of

9   our origin, purpose, and proposed functions, two copies

10   of which I am pleased to enclose herewith."

11             Did I read that right?

12       A.   You did.

13       Q.   Okay. Now -- and attached, in fact, was a

14   Statement of Purpose, right?

15       A.   Articles of Incorporation.

16       Q.   Let's look at page -- let's see -- 6. Page 6.

17            All right. So this is page 6 of the Statement

18   Of Purpose, Articles Of Incorporation, whatever you

19   would like to call it.

20            But it says right there in this communication

21    to the Department of Justice that they're going to use

22   Hill & Knowlton as the PR firm for TIRC, right?

23       A.   Yes.

24       Q.   Okay. Now, if we could, take a look at the

25   next page, page 7. 3704

1        A.   Okay.

2       Q.   This communication to the Department of Justice

3   also told the Department of Justice that the committee

4   would be proceeding under the advice of legal counsel

5   selected from among the counsel or nominees of its

6   members, right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Okay. All of that was sent to the Department

9   of Justice in January of 1954, correct?

10       A.   Yeah, the end of the month, January 26th.

11        Q.   Okay. Now, the TIRC's formation was announced

12   publicly in the "Frank Statement," right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=592
13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   And you spent some time showing the jury the

15    "Frank Statement" and kind of going through some of the

16   parts of the "Frank Statement," right?

17       A.   Correct. January 4th, I think.

18       Q.   Okay. And you've already explained that TIRC

19   later was called Council for Tobacco Research or CTR?

20       A.   Changed it's name in March of 1964.

21        Q.   To Council for Tobacco Research, or CTR, right?

22       A.   Right.

23       Q.   Okay. Now, first, let's start where I usually

24   do with Mrs. Loyd.

25            You've reviewed the record and you can agree 3705

1   with me, can't you, that there is simply no evidence at

2   all in this case that Mrs. Loyd ever heard of the TIRC

3   or CTR?

4       A.   We don't know one way or the other.

5       Q.   Total lack of evidence about whether she ever

6   heard of those, right?

7       A.   There is no evidence. She's not around to tell

8   us.

9       Q.   Okay. Now, the "Frank Statement" was published

10   on January 4th, 1954. That's when it ran, right?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Okay. And it only ran as an ad in a newspaper

13   that one time, right?

14       A.   As an ad in the newspaper?

15       Q.   Yeah.

16       A.   Yeah, as an ad in the newspaper, it only ran

17   one time. It went on for a lot longer.

18       Q.   Okay. That was -- that was one of those "yes"

19   or "no" questions.

20       A.   Yes, it ran in the newspaper article one time.

21        Q.   Now, same question back to Mrs. Loyd. There is

22   no evidence from anyplace or from anyone in this case

23   that Mrs. Loyd ever saw the "Frank Statement," is there?

24       A.   That ad, no.

25       Q.   Okay. Now, before we talked about the document 3706

1   itself, you talked a lot about the cultural environment

2   back then.

3            When it comes to frank statements, the use of

4   that type of a title, "Frank Statement," was not unique

5   to the tobacco industry in the early 1950s, was it?

6       A.   No.

7       Q.   Okay. Other companies and industries used

8   advertisements known as "frank statements," right?

9       A.   Referred to as issue ads, yes.

10       Q.   Okay. In fact, you've testified that it's a

11    common method used in public relations to issue frank

12   statements, right?

13       A.   Sure.

14       Q.   Okay. And you've seen other examples of frank

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=593
15   statements that weren't related to tobacco companies at

16   all, right?

17       A.   Sure. BP, for example.

18            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

19     THE COURT: Yes.

20 BY MR. WALKER:

21        Q.   I'm actually --1 just handed you four

22   demonstrative exhibits with some examples of other frank

23   statements that were issued in this period in the early

24    1950s. You've seen those before or ones like it in your

25   research; have you not? 3707

1        A.   I've seen it at trial, yeah.

2       Q.   Okay. In your work, right, your second job as

3   testifying, you've seen frank statements like those

4   before, right?

5       A.   Yes, I've seen it at trial presented by

6   defense.

7       Q.   Okay. Is that because you didn't find -- you

8   didn't see it in your research? You didn't find these?

9       A.   No, I haven't gone to look for frank statements

10   on constipation or baldness or fur.

11        Q.   Okay. But you talked about all of your

12   expertise in marketing and advertising and how you

13   researched in these areas. You haven't seen examples

14   like these in your own work?

15       A.   I've seen frank statements, but my work is

16   focused on what the cigarette companies knew and what

17   they said.

18       Q.   Okay. But you took into account, did you not,

19   when you were giving your testimony, that there are

20   these types of frank statements in this time period,

21    right?

22       A.   Yes. I answered that question before, and the

23   answer was yes.

24            MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I'd like to

25       display demonstratives 12, 13, 14, and 15 that I've 3708

1       just handed to Dr. Cummings and to opposing counsel.

2            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

3            THE COURT: All right.

4   BY MR. WALKER:

5       Q.   Let's take a look at the first one. All right.

6   So these are some examples of other frank statements.

7   This one is "A Frank Statement on a, Quote, Delicate

8   Subject: Constipation," right?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   All right. That one's from 1950.

11             The next one from 1950, "A Frank Statement to

12   Men and Women Over 35 Who Are Tired." All right.

13   That's another frank statement, right?

14       A.   We're probably getting stuck in this quote.

15       Q.   Okay. Let's look at the next one. This one is

16   from 1953. "A Frank Statement to Men About Baldness."

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=594
17   Another frank statement, right?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   Okay. Let's look at the next one. A 1954, "A

20   Frank Statement About Fur Prices."

21             Do you see that?

22       A.   I do.

23       Q.   Okay. Now, let's go back to the frank

24   statement that you showed the jury.

25            MR. WALKER: This is Plaintiffs 307 in 3709

1        evidence. Can we pull that up?

2   BY MR. WALKER:

3       Q.   All right. Let's start at the beginning.

4            By the way, you didn't start at the beginning

5   when you were showing this document to the jury, did

6   you? Did you read these highlighted parts here?

7       A.   I mentioned the first sentence when I

8   testified, yes.

9       Q.   I'm sorry. I'm asking if you actually read

10   these initial parts.

11        A.   No, I don't believe I read those.

12       Q.   Okay. Let's read them now.

13       A.   Sure.

14       Q.   "Recent reports on experiments with mice have

15   given wide publicity to a theory that cigarette smoking

16   is in some way linked with lung cancer in human beings."

17            Right? That's what it says?

18       A.   That's what it says.

19       Q.   And that first paragraph is a true statement,

20   isn't it?

21        A.   Is it a true statement that recent reports --

22   yes.

23       Q.   Okay.

24       A.   There were -- there were mouse experiments. I

25   think I showed major experiments that were publicized in 3710

1   LIFE Magazine.

2       Q.   That was in 1953, right?

3       A.   Right.

4            Plus the Teague work that had 40 of the mice in

5   the experiments.

6       Q.   Well, the Wynder and Graham studies from 1953

7   did, in fact, receive wide publicity, didn't they?

8       A.   They did.

9       Q.   They were written in mainstream magazines like

10   LIFE, Time, Newsweek, Reader's Digest, right?

11        A.   True.

12       Q.   LIFE Magazine even ran a spread showing

13   pictures of the mice with tumors on their backs from

14   application of the tar, right?

15       A.   That's right. We showed the jury that.

16       Q.   Who showed the jury that?

17       A.   We did.

18       Q.   You did?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=595
19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   Okay. All right. Next paragraph. "Although

21    conducted by doctors of professional standing, these

22   experiments are not regarded as conclusive in the field

23   of cancer research."

24            Did I read that correctly?

25       A.   You did. 3711

1        Q.   And that is a correct statement, right?

2       A.   At the time.

3       Q.   Okay. These experiments, at the time, were not

4   regarded as conclusive in the field of cancer research,

5   were they?

6       A.   I would agree.

7       Q.   Okay. Now, you would agree that when the

8   "Frank Statement" came out in 1954, there was not a

9   medical consensus on whether smoking cigarettes caused

10   lung cancer? You'd agree with that, wouldn't you?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   All right. In fact, Dr. Wynder himself said

13   the purpose for doing his study with the mice was not to

14   prove that smoking causes lung cancer in men, right? He

15   said that, didn't he?

16       A.   Which study are you referring to of

17   Dr. Wynder's?

18       Q.   I'm referring to the study that we were just

19   talking about.

20       A.   Which one is that?

21        Q.   The mice study. That's the one you're talking

22   about, isn't it?

23       A.   I'm asking you. You're asking the question.

24   What study are you referring to?

25       Q.   Weren't you talking about the study with the 3712

1   painting of the tar on the backs of mice?

2       A.   I wasn't. You were.

3            Yes, Dr. Wynder wrote a study. I was just

4   wondering which of the 600 publications from Dr. Wynder

5   you're referring to.

6       Q.   Okay. I'm sorry. I thought when we were

7   talking about the first paragraph, we were both talking

8   about the same study from 1953.

9       A.   If you were talking about that study, I was

10   just wondering whether you knew when that study was.

11        Q.   You understand that this is my opportunity to

12   ask you questions, Dr. Cummings.

13       A.   Sure. You would like me to tell you when it

14   was?

15       Q.   Not the other way around, right?

16       A.   Cancer research in June --

17       Q.   Okay.

18       A.   -- of 1953, that was the mouse painting

19   experiment that Wynder did. But I'm wondering where

20   you're getting the quote from. He wrote 600

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=596
21   publications. I knew Dr. Wynder personally, and he, you

22   know, wrote many things.

23            So you're asking me about what Dr. Wynder is

24   saying, and I'm just asking you--

25       Q.   Do you think it's important to your testimony 3713

1   to add in there that you knew Dr. Wynder personally? Do

2   you think that's important to help the jury do its job

3   in this case?

4       A.   Sure.

5       Q.   You do?

6       A.   Absolutely.

7       Q.   All right. Let's go back to the National

8   Cancer Institute. The National Cancer Institute was and

9   is a division of the National Institutes of Health,

10   right?

11        A.   That's right.

12       Q.   Okay. That's part of the U.S. Public Health

13   Service?

14       A.   Yes, it is.

15       Q.   Okay. And that, in turn, is part of the

16   federal government, right?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   Now, you would agree with me that the National

19   Cancer Institute is and has been the largest cancer

20   research organization in the United States?

21        A.   Yes, in the world.

22       Q.   In the world.

23            Back in the 1950s, it was regarded by the

24   medical and scientific community as one of the most

25   authoritative organizations on cancer research, correct? 3714

1        A.   Yes. Still is.

2       Q.   Now, in 1953, the head of the National Cancer

3   Institute, Dr. John Heller, said there wasn't enough

4   proof that smoking caused lung cancer, correct?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   By the way, you're not telling this jury that

7   the National Cancer Institute was part of a 50-year

8   coverup, are you?

9       A.   No.

10       Q.   Okay. You're not telling this jury that

11    Dr. John Heller, head of the National Cancer Institute,

12   was part of a 50-year coverup, are you?

13       A.   No, I'm not.

14       Q.   Okay. Now, in 1953 and 1954, this time period,

15   there were other scientists in the United States who

16   didn't believe that smoking had been scientifically

17   proven to cause lung cancer in humans, correct?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   All right. In fact, you've seen an interview

20   of Dr. Cuyler Hammond in U.S. News and World Report from

21    February of 1954, right?

22       A.   Yes.

23            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

24            THE COURT: Yes.

25   BY MR. WALKER: 3715

1        Q.   All right. The document that I've just handed

2   you is a copy, is it not, of the interview of

3   Dr. Hammond in U.S. News and World Report from

4   February 1954, right?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   Okay. And you've seen this article before,

7   you're familiar with it, right?

8       A.   Yes, I am.

9       Q.   Took it into consideration in giving your

10   testimony and your opinions, right?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Okay. Before we show this, Dr. Hammond was the

13   Director of Statistical Research at the American Cancer

14   Society, right?

15       A.   True.

16       Q.   Okay. And Dr. Hammond thought that the

17   connection between cigarette smoking and lung cancer was

18   just a theory, right?

19       A.   Well, it started out as a theory, sure.

20            MR. WALKER: Okay. I'd like to display,

21        Your Honor, this U.S. News and World Report article

22       from 1954.

23            THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk?

24            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

25       Sorry. 3716

1            THE COURT: All right.

2            MR. WALKER: So U.S. News and World Report,

3       February 26, 1954. Let's get the other highlighted

4       part there.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6       Q.   "Is there proof smoking causes cancer?

7   Exclusive interview."

8            MR. WALKER: All right. And let's turn to the

9       actual interview, please.

10   BY MR. WALKER:

11        Q.   "Is there proof that smoking causes cancer?

12   Interview with Dr. E. Cuyler Hammond." Let's just look

13   at the very first question right off the bat. Tell me

14   if I have this right.

15             "Question: Does smoking really cause lung

16   cancer, Dr. Hammond? People are saying all sorts of

17   things about cigarette smoking.

18             "Answer: That's just what we are trying to

19   find out. There is some evidence that it may be so.

20   For example, material collected from cigarette smoke

21    will produce cancer on the skin of a susceptible mouse

22   if you keep up the experiment long enough. That's an

23   important piece of information, but taken alone, it

24   doesn't prove a thing about the occurrence of lung

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=598
25   cancer in human beings. It has to be weighed together 3717

1   with other evidence, and we are still collecting

2   information."

3            Did I read that correctly?

4       A.   You did.

5       Q.   Now, let's be clear. That's what Dr. Hammond,

6   a scientist at the American Cancer Society, is telling

7   the American public one month after the "Frank

8   Statement," right?

9       A.   True.

10       Q.   That cigarette smoking had not been

11    scientifically proven to cause lung cancer, correct?

12       A.   Well, that's true. He said there is some

13   evidence in converging lines, which he talks about in

14   the remainder of the article.

15       Q.   By the way, are you telling this jury that the

16   American Cancer Society was part of the 50-year coverup?

17       A.   No, sir.

18       Q.   And when Dr. Hammond expressed his opinion that

19   the mouse painting studies alone didn't prove a thing

20   about the occurrence of lung cancer in human beings, are

21    you telling this jury that Dr. Hammond was part of a

22   50-year coverup?

23       A.   Dr. Hammond -- that's a multiple question. He

24   wasn't part of a coverup. It's true that the mouse

25   painting experiments by themselves would not be 3718

1    sufficient. He talks about other converging lines of

2   evidence and the fact, at this time, that the American

3   Cancer Society was collecting that evidence, which they

4   later released.

5       Q.   All right. Now, let's see. In 1955 -- you

6   talked with the jury about the See It Now show, right?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   And on that same show, Dr. Hueper, head of the

9   National Cancer Institute's cancer studies, was

10   interviewed on that show, right?

11        A.   That's correct.

12       Q.   Okay.

13       A.   Carcinogenesis lab.

14       Q.   What was that?

15       A.   Carcinogenesis lab.

16       Q.   Carcinogenesis lab. Okay.

17            By the way, I've already asked you about the

18   National Cancer Institute. Let me ask you about

19   Dr. Hueper specifically and what he said in 1955.

20            Are you telling this jury -- let me just ask

21    you, was Dr. Hueper part of a 50-year coverup?

22       A.   No, sir.

23       Q.   Was he part of a conspiracy with the tobacco

24   companies?

25       A.   No. 3719

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=599
1        Q.   Okay. But you're aware of the interview that

2   he gave on the See It Now show that you showed to the

3   jury, right?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   You've seen it before, you're familiar with

6   what he said?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   You took it into account in giving your

9   testimony, right?

10       A.   Yes.

11             MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I would like to

12       display a portion of the See It Now show involving

13       Dr. Hueper.

14            THE WITNESS: Hueper. It's not "Hooper." It's

15       Hueper.

16            MR. WALKER: Hueper. Thank you.

17            THE COURT: Any objection?

18            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

19            THE COURT: All right.

20            (The video was published to the jury in open

21        court as follows:)

22            "Next we went to the National Cancer Institute

23       of the U.S. Public Health Service. This is

24       Dr. W.C. Hueper, Chief, Environmental Cancer

25       Section. 3720

1             "Doctor, do you believe that cigarette smoking

2       is a major factor among possible causes of lung

3       cancer?

4            "I do not believe that cigarette smoking is one

5       of the major causes of cancer of the lung amongst

6       the various causes which may be responsible for

7       cancer of the lung."

8            (Whereupon, publishing of the video stopped.)

9   BY MR. WALKER:

10       Q.   Now, similar to Dr. Hammond, Dr. Hueper said

11    that the link between smoking and cancer at that time

12   had not been proven, right?

13       A.   That's true at that time.

14       Q.   See It Now also interviewed the incoming

15   president of the American Medical Association, right?

16       A.   It did.

17       Q.   That was a Dr. Elmer Hess?

18       A.   Correct.

19       Q.   All right. Now, you're not going to tell this

20   jury that the American Medical Association was part of a

21    50-year coverup, are you?

22       A.   Well, there were -- there is some evidence

23   about the American Medical Association getting --

24       Q.   I'm not asking you -- I'm just asking you "yes"

25   or "no." 3721

1            Are you telling this jury that the American

2   Medical Association was part of a 50-year coverup?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=600
3       A.   No. The coverup was the industry.

4       Q.   All right. What about Dr. Hess, are you

5   telling this jury that Dr. Elmer Hess was part of a

6   50-year coverup?

7       A.   No.

8       Q.   Was he involved in a conspiracy with the

9   tobacco companies?

10       A.   Dr. Hess, no.

11        Q.   Okay.

12       A.   Others at AM A, yes.

13       Q.   But you understood I was just asking you about

14   Dr. Hess, right?

15       A.   Yes. I just wanted to clarify.

16       Q.   What you wanted to clarify is that you believe

17   some other people in the American Medical Association

18   were involved in a conspiracy with the tobacco

19   companies, yes or no?

20       A.   Yes.

21             I can explain, if you like.

22       Q.   Actually, remember we talked about getting you

23   out of here in less than three days. I'd just like to

24   continue on with my questions. All right?

25            So we were talking about how Dr. Hess was also 3722

1   interviewed on the See It Now show, right?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   Okay. And he said pretty much the same thing,

4   right, that the link between smoking and lung cancer had

5   not been proven?

6       A.   That's right.

7       Q.   You've seen what he said on the See It Now

8   show; you took that into consideration in giving your

9   opinions?

10       A.   Yes.

11             MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I would like to

12       publish at this time the portion of the See It Now

13       involving Dr. -- hold on a second.

14            THE WITNESS: Hess.

15            MR. WALKER: Yes, Dr. Hess.

16            THE COURT: Any objection?

17            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

18            THE COURT: All right.

19            (The video was published to the jury in open

20   court as follows:)

21             "Next Tuesday, Dr. Elmer Hess of Erie,

22   Pennsylvania, becomes president of the American Medical

23   Association. He speaks now, however, as a physician who

24   does not believe there is any important relationship

25   between smoking and cancer. 3723

1             "Well, I think you have to depend upon the man

2   who prepares the statistics more than anything else.

3   You've heard the old saying, "Lies, damn lies, and

4   statistics." You can make statistics do anything if

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=601
5   you're interested in coming up with a certain objective.

6   I don't mean to say that the statistics that are given

7   to us on various things are incorrect, but very often

8   the individual is so enthusiastic that he points the

9   statistics to prove his point."

10            (Whereupon, publishing of the video stopped.)

11    BY MR. WALKER:

12       Q.   And we talked a little bit earlier about

13   Dr. Heller, right, of the National Cancer Institute?

14       A.   Yes.

15       Q.   And I think you agreed with me that Dr. Heller

16   was not part of some 50-year coverup, right?

17       A.   No. The National Cancer Institute wasn't part

18   of a coverup.

19       Q.   And Dr. Heller was not involved in a conspiracy

20   with the tobacco companies, was he?

21        A.   No.

22       Q.   All right. He was interviewed on See It Now

23   also, wasn't he?

24       A.   Yes, he was.

25       Q.   By the way, these clips of these people from 3724

1   the public health community, you didn't show that in

2   your presentation, did you?

3       A.   No.

4       Q.   Okay. Well, let's take a look at what

5   Dr. Heller had to say on the See It Now show.

6            (The video was published to the jury in open

7   court as follows:)

8            "We ask Dr. John R. Heller, Director, National

9   Cancer Institute, U.S. Public Health Service to comment.

10            "I'm director of the National Cancer Institute.

11    I have been requested by the Surgeon General of the

12   United States Public Health Service to indicate our

13   interest and activity in the increasing problem of lung

14   cancer. There seems to be, without any doubt, a

15   reasonableness that the risk of acquiring lung cancer is

16   greater among smokers than in nonsmokers. We do not say

17   that smoking is a cause of cancer."

18            (Whereupon, publishing of the video stopped.)

19   BY MR. WALKER:

20       Q.   All right. Let's see. You -- certainly you're

21    familiar with the Mayo Clinic, right?

22       A.   Sure.

23       Q.   All right. And you're familiar with

24   Dr. Charles Mayo of the Mayo Clinic, right?

25       A.   lam. 3725

1        Q.   Okay. In 1958, Dr. Mayo also took the position

2   in 1958 that it had not been proven that smoking caused

3   lung cancer, right?

4       A.   He did take that position.

5       Q.   Okay. Would you tell this jury whether you

6   believe that Dr. Mayo of the Mayo Clinic was part of a

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=602
7   50-year coverup, yes or no?

8       A.   I don't know.

9       Q.   You don't know?

10       A.   No. I know Mayo Clinic received a lot of

11    money--

12       Q.   I'm not asking you -- Doctor, that was -- I'm

13   trying to make these easy for you. Okay?

14       A.   That was the explanation.

15       Q.   Well, I didn't ask you for your explanation. I

16   just think the jury ought to know --

17            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I think he has the

18       right to explain and finish his answer.

19            THE COURT: It was a "yes" or "no" question.

20   BY MR. WALKER:

21        Q.   Are you telling this jury that the Mayo Clinic

22   was part of a conspiracy with the tobacco companies?

23       A.   Yes, they were. And I can explain.

24       Q.   Are you telling this jury that Dr. Mayo of the

25   Mayo Clinic was in a conspiracy with the tobacco 3726

1    companies?

2       A.   I don't know specifically about Dr. Mayo.

3       Q.   All right.

4       A.   I know others took money also.

5       Q.   Now, in 1962, Dr. Lewis Robbins of the Public

6   Health Service publicly said there wasn't enough

7   evidence for a cause-and-effect relationship between

8   smoking and lung cancer, right?

9       A.   Yes, I remember that statement.

10       Q.   All right. Same question. Was the Public

11    Health Service in a conspiracy with the tobacco

12   companies?

13       A.   No, not at all.

14       Q.   Was the Public Health Service part of the

15   50-year coverup?

16       A.   No. Dr. Robbins wasn't speaking on behalf of

17   the Public Health Service.

18       Q.   Was Dr. Robbins -- in your view, yes or no, was

19   Dr. Lewis Robbins part of a 50-year coverup?

20       A.   No.

21        Q.   Okay. Was Dr. Lewis Robbins in some kind of

22   conspiracy with the tobacco companies?

23       A.   No, just misinformed.

24       Q.   All right.

25            MR. WALKER: Okay. Let's go back to the "Frank 3727

1        Statement" in evidence, Plaintiffs 307. Let's go

2       to the second -- it's the second paragraph.

3   BY MR. WALKER:

4       Q.   All right. We started -- we were just talking

5   about the first sentence there, but I don't want to

6   leave out the second sentence.

7            "However, we do not believe that any serious

8   medical research, even though its results are

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=603
9   inconclusive, should be disregarded or lightly

10   dismissed."

11             "We do not believe that any serious medical

12   research" -- goes on to say -- "should be disregarded or

13   lightly dismissed."

14            That's what that says, right?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   Okay. And that's a responsible statement,

17   isn't it?

18       A.   Sure.

19       Q.   Okay. All right. Let's move to the next

20   paragraph.

21             "At the same time, we feel it is in the public

22   interest to call attention to the fact that eminent

23   doctors and research scientists have publicly questioned

24   the claimed significance of these experiments."

25            You see that? 3728

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   All right. Now, let me ask you, it's true, is

3   it not, that eminent doctors and research scientists

4   have publicly questioned the claimed significance of the

5   experiments? True or false?

6       A.   You're reading down to the next statements?

7   Just could I see the full statement?

8       Q.   No, I'm just asking you a question.

9       A.   I'm trying to answer that.

10            True.

11        Q.   Okay. You can see the rest of it.

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   Now, again, my question to you, sir, is, true

14   or false, eminent doctors and research scientists have

15   publicly questioned the claimed significance of these

16   experiments? True or false?

17       A.   True.

18       Q.   Okay. All right.

19            Now, you wanted to look at the --1 guess,

20   let's start with No. 1. That was what you wanted us to

21   bring up, right?

22       A.   That's right. That's what I thought we were

23   referencing.

24       Q.   So let me read that. It's not what I was

25   referencing then, but I'll -- let's talk about it now. 3729

1            It says --No. 1 says that medical --

2   "Distinguished authorities point out that medical

3   research of recent years indicates many possible causes

4   of lung cancer."

5            Did I read that right?

6       A.   Yes, you did.

7       Q.   Okay. And it was true, was it not, that

8   medical research of recent years had indicated many

9   possible causes of lung cancer? True or false?

10       A.   True.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=604
11        Q.   Okay. All right. The next one, No. 2, "There

12   is no agreement among the authorities regarding what the

13   cause is."

14            Did I read that right?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   Okay. And it was true at that time that there

17   was no agreement among the authorities regarding what

18   the cause is? True or false?

19       A.   True.

20       Q.   In 1954, medical research still indicated many

21   possible causes of lung cancer, didn't it?

22       A.   Sure.

23       Q.   And there was, in fact, disagreement at that

24   time among medical authorities regarding what the cause

25   would be, right? 3730

1        A.   Correct. There wasn't unanimity.

2       Q.   Okay.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, rule of

4       completeness, that he read paragraph 3 as well,

5       please.

6            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I object. They've

7       already had more than their fair opportunity to

8       discuss this document.

9            THE COURT: Okay. Let me see paragraph 3,

10       please.

11             All right. You can publish paragraph 3.

12   BY MR. WALKER:

13       Q.   Okay. Paragraph 3 says that, "There is no

14   proof that cigarette smoking is one of the causes."

15            Did I read that correctly?

16       A.   Yes. That's a false statement.

17       Q.   Okay. Well, you went on at length about that

18   in your presentation with Mr. Uiterwyk, right?

19       A.   I did.

20       Q.   Okay. Now, we were talking about

21    Hill & Knowlton, the public relations firm that helped

22   out with the "Frank Statement," right?

23       A.   Yes.

24       Q.   Okay. And you've reviewed a number of

25   documents from Hill & Knowlton. You talked about your 3731

1   review of those documents in your direct examination,

2   right?

3       A.   That's correct.

4       Q.   I want to ask you about one of them.

5            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

6            THE COURT: Yes.

7            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

8   BY MR. WALKER:

9       Q.   Okay. All right. This is a memorandum on

10   Hill & Knowlton letterhead, right?

11        A.   It is.

12       Q.   Dated March 5th, 1954, correct?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=605
13       A.   Correct.

14       Q.   And it's from B.R. Litton to Mr. John Hill,

15   correct?

16       A.   Correct.

17       Q.   You've seen this document before, haven't you?

18       A.   I don't recall it offhand, but I may have. I

19   don't know.

20       Q.   Take a minute and take a look at it. You told

21    us about all the Hill & Knowlton documents you've looked

22   at, how you've written about them, you've got these

23   collections. Take a look at it and tell me if you've

24   seen it before. And I'm not asking if you've memorized

25   it; just whether you're familiar with it. 3732

1        A.   No. No.

2       Q.   No, you don't know that one?

3       A.   No.

4       Q.   Okay. All right. Just by the way, the date of

5   that document that you have, that's a few months after

6   the "Frank Statement," right?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   Okay. Did you look at other documents from

9   this time period from Hill & Knowlton after the "Frank

10   Statement"?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Just not this one?

13       A.   I don't recall this one.

14       Q.   Okay. Now, you're aware, are you not, that the

15   Surgeon General reported that when the "Frank Statement"

16   was published, it actually caused an increase in the

17   belief that smoking was dangerous, right?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   All right. Now, I want to move on to the

20   organization that was created in this time period and

21    announced through the "Frank Statement," the Tobacco

22   Industry Research Committee, right?

23       A.   Okay.

24            THE COURT: Mr. Walker, are you moving to a new

25       area now? 3733

1            MR. WALKER: Yes, I am, Judge.

2            THE COURT: All right. This might be a

3       convenient time for a midmorning break.

4            MR. WALKER: It would be.

5            THE COURT: So we'll be in recess for 15

6       minutes. And be mindful of my instructions. Thank

7       you.

8            (The jury excused from the courtroom at

9    10:15 a.m.)

10            THE COURT: All right. Be in recess for 15

11        minutes.

12            (Recess taken from 10:16 a.m. to 10:37 a.m.)

13            (Court was called to order at 10:37 a.m.)

14            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, can we have one

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=606
15       moment --

16            THE COURT: Yeah.

17            MR. UITERWYK: -- before the jury --

18            MR. TRENTALANGE: Your Honor, I have a matter

19       to discuss with the Court before the jury gets back

20       in.

21             THE COURT: Okay.

22            MR. TRENT ALANGE: If it please the Court.

23            THE COURT: Okay.

24            MR. TRENT ALANGE: Your Honor, I just wanted to

25       make two observations, and one of them kind of in 3734

1        the form of an objection. Actually, both in the

2       form of an objection.

3            But one -- these witness -- the witness and

4       counsel, obviously, have some sort of track record,

5       and it's understandable that there is a little bit

6       of back and forth, but I would just ask that any

7       admonishments come from the Court based on motion;

8       that we not have questions from counsel like "Do you

9       think you need to slip that in there," things of

10       that nature, because that's inappropriate.

11             If the answer is nonresponsive, then the

12       objection is that it's nonresponsive. Any

13       admonishment or admonition should come from the

14       Court. So I just want to ask that that not occur.

15            THE COURT: Okay. A couple of those questions

16       have been somewhat -- when the witness may have

17       provided more information than what was called for

18       in the answer, counsel said those comments, "You

19       needed to slip that in there." I think that is

20       argumentative.

21             So while the answer -- and I'm not passing on

22       making judgment on whether or not the answer may --

23       may or may not have been somewhat unresponsive. I

24       don't think it's appropriate to do that.

25            MR. WALKER: I won't do it again, Your Honor. 3735

1            THE COURT: Okay. That's fine.

2            MR. TRENT ALANGE: The second and more

3       substantive objection, Your Honor, is that these

4       questions -- and I have followed along on the screen

5       at sidebar. As I understand it, the basis for these

6       questions is that they go to reprehensibility.

7            There has already been an Engle finding that

8       the defendants in this case did conceal information,

9       so there is a coverup. And questions like Do you

10       think so and so was part of the coverup, Do you

11        think so and so was part of the coverup, the clear

12       implication of those questions is to suggest that

13       there was no coverup, because it would have

14       necessarily had to involve people of high respect.

15       There is --

16            THE COURT: All of you can be seated if you

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=607
17       choose to be.

18            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Judge.

19            MR. TRENTALANGE: There is a coverup in this

20       case. There is a finding of concealment in this

21        case. Your Honor read those findings to the jury

22       during voir dire. You declined to do it again at

23       opening. And voir dire was a long, long time ago.

24            So if those types of questions are allowed, we

25       would request a limiting instruction that, first of 3736

1        all, the Engle finding of concealment be read again

2       and that these questions go only -- the answers to

3       these questions, evidence adduced from them, go only

4       to reprehensibility. Because right now the jury is

5       probably thinking that whether or not --or they're

6       thinking, in its mind it's going to have to

7       determine whether or not there was some sort of

8       concealment, because of question after question

9       about do you think so and so was part of the coverup

10       so -

11             THE COURT: Okay. Response.

12            MR. WALKER: Actually, Judge, I think the jury

13       has already heard about a day of testimony from

14       Dr. Cummings that would lead them to believe that

15       they had to decide whether there was a coverup.

16       Mr. Uiterwyk introduced this topic.

17            My questions about people like Dr. Mayo, like

18       Dr. Heller, those questions, I don't think anyone

19       could have come away with the impression that

20       Mr. Trentalange apparently did.

21             The clear point of those questions was to show

22       that there were some people in the 1950s who

23       believed that there was no link between cigarette

24       smoking and lung cancer, and you didn't have to be

25       part of a conspiracy to think that. And that shows 3737

1        that it was reasonable or certainly not

2       reprehensible for people to have that belief and to

3       communicate that belief in public statements.

4            THE COURT: Well, we're dealing with a very

5       unusual situation. I think counsel -- all counsel

6       would admit that.

7            What I mean by that is this. First of all, I'm

8       not sure the Engle findings say that there was a

9       50-year conspiracy. It says there was a conspiracy.

10       I don't -- the question, as I read the verdict,

11        doesn't say how long the conspiracy was.

12            But leaving that aside, we have a situation

13       where we already have a finding by another jury that

14       this Court is bound by. But notwithstanding that

15       fact, the plaintiffs have chosen to put on evidence

16       that they believe corroborates that finding or at

17       least with respect to the issue of reprehensibility.

18       Primarily, I would assume, that the reason for

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=608
19       that -- the reason for that is so that -- is for

20       punitive damages so the jury can make a finding that

21        this case warrants the finding of punitive damages.

22            So notwithstanding the fact that there isn't a

23       finding, the plaintiff has chosen to put on

24       additional evidence. So the defendant certainly, as

25       to that, has a right to put on a defense to those 3738

1        matters that you assert. I can't let it -- only one

2       side put on affirmative evidence without allowing

3       the opposing side to put on evidence that they

4       believe disproves that they acted in a reprehensible

5       manner.

6            MR. TRENTALANGE: And I'm not suggesting that

7       they be prohibited from doing that. The point that

8       I'm making is, the matter in which the questioning

9       is proceeding is creating the impression,

10       deliberately, I think, that there is or was no

11        concealment.

12            We also have to introduce that evidence,

13       Your Honor, for -- to show legal cause, because the

14       defense will try to point out, and I think will

15       point out, that we have to prove that there was a

16       connection, a causal connection, between the

17       concealment and the injuries sustained by the

18       plaintiff in this -- or plaintiffs decedent in this

19       case. We have to prove reliance. So it's

20       absolutely -- you know, on the one hand, we chose to

21       put that evidence on, but our choices are driven by

22       the pleadings and their denials in the pleadings.

23            So, you know, this evidence is required because

24       I'm pretty sure at the close of our case there is

25       going to be directed verdict motion. And if we 3739

1        haven't dotted all the Is and crossed all the Ts,

2       that's going to be pointed out.

3            So it's not the evidence itself. It's the

4       manner in which that evidence is being adduced by

5       the questioning. And it'd be quite easy to phrase

6       those questions in a manner that didn't suggest the

7       absence of any concealment. But that's not been

8       done. And I think deliberately so.

9            So that's why we would ask again either for the

10       Engle findings to be read again or for limiting

11        instruction that the evidence can be considered to

12       you on -- by you on the issue of reprehensibility.

13            MR. UITERWYK: Not on the issue of concealment.

14            MR. TRENTALANGE: And not on the issue of

15       concealment.

16            MR. WALKER: I have to object to both of those.

17       I think the jury will find them confusing.

18            No similar instruction was given when they were

19       putting on their evidence about this topic. And the

20       fact of the matter is, there's no finding about

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=609
21        Dr. Mayo and there's no finding about Dr. Heller or

22       Dr. Hueper or any of the people that I asked that

23       question about.

24            I've not asked any question to suggest anything

25       about whether there was a conspiracy among the 3740

1        tobacco defendants. The point that I made through

2       my questioning is that the -- first of all, the

3       statements made in the "Frank Statement," many of

4       them were true, and that the position that was taken

5       by some of these people -- some of these people

6       during this time period was sincerely held. And

7       that's in some of the documents that they themselves

8       admitted.

9            MR. TRENTALANGE: I'm not objecting to those

10       questions, Judge. I mean, those questions are

11        unobjectable. The specific questions naming

12       individuals and asking them whether they were part

13       of the conspiracy and then, you know -- you got

14       to -- they like to quote Mark Twain. One of his

15       quotes is --

16            THE COURT: I'm familiar with it.

17            MR. TRENTALANGE: -- "Light can travel halfway

18       around the world before the truth gets out of bed."

19            THE COURT: Oh, that one, I'm not familiar

20       with.

21             MR. WALKER: Judge, I think that's peculiarly

22       applicable to the fact that Dr. Cummings was on the

23       stand and I didn't get him until the fourth day. So

24       I knew --

25            THE COURT: All right. One at a time, please. 3741

1            MR. UITERWYK: The reason that occurred,

2       because you objected to him seeing the documents.

3            MR. WALKER: Well, maybe it would have been

4       three days without an objection.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Because we only-

6            MR. TRENTALANGE: I have the talking stamp.

7       Okay?

8            MR. UITERWYK: All right. You do.

9            MR. TRENTALANGE: So the point is, it's

10       particularly harmful when he's not permitted to

11        explain things like was the AMA part of the

12       conspiracy. Well, he's got an explanation about

13       that, but he's --

14            THE COURT: Well, I know, but that's the

15       purpose of redirect. I'm not going to -- he

16       can't --

17            MR. TRENTALANGE: I'm not arguing with that,

18       Your Honor--

19            THE COURT: He -

20            MR. TRENTALANGE: -- but the point is, the

21        question invited it and that the nature of the

22       question itself is inappropriate with that.

23            THE COURT: Well, okay. All right.

24            MR. UITERWYK: I don't think it's relevant to

25       whether the doctors or AMA was part of the 3742

1        conspiracy. That's not the issue in this case.

2            MR. WALKER: It's absolutely relevant for the

3       reasons I mentioned, and it goes to his credibility.

4            THE COURT: All right. I'm going to

5       respectfully decline your request, Mr. Trentalange.

6       I think they'll get an additional -- they'll be

7       instructed on the Engle findings at the close of the

8       case. I think now, if I gave that finding, it would

9       emphasize one jury instruction over another. And I

10       think the cross-examination has been appropriate on

11        the issue of reprehensibility. And so your motion's

12       denied.

13            MR. TRENTALANGE: Are you denying it on the

14       limiting instruction as well, Your Honor?

15            THE COURT: Yes.

16            MR. TRENTALANGE: Okay.

17            THE COURT: Okay. Bring the jury in.

18            (The jury entered the courtroom at 10:48 a.m.)

19            THE COURT: Thank you. You may be seated.

20            Let me see counsel briefly.

21             (At the bench.)

22            THE COURT: I'd like to go to about 12:15

23       rather than 12:00 because of our discussion here for

24       the last 15 minutes.

25            MR. WALKER: Okay. 3743

1            THE COURT: So it doesn't have to be exactly,

2       but just something to shoot for.

3            MR. WALKER: I'll try to keep that in mind,

4       Your Honor.

5            (In open court.)

6            MR. WALKER: May it please the Court?

7            THE COURT: Yes, sir.

8   BY MR. WALKER:

9       Q.   Hello again, Dr. Cummings.

10       A.   Hello.

11        Q.I want to turn to a new area and talk a little

12   bit more about the TIRC and the CTR. Okay?

13       A.   That's fine.

14       Q.   You would agree with me that you made some

15   pretty strong allegations about the conduct and the

16   purpose of those -- of TIRC and CTR, right?

17       A.   It's factual ones.

18       Q.   Okay. Well, you were -- let's be clear. You

19   were critical of the way that those organizations were

20   used, right?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   Okay. But truth be told, you would agree that

23   a lot of the CTR-funded research was excellent, right?

24       A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=611
25       Q.   And you agree that CTR funded some very 3744

1   important work related to smoking and health, right?

2       A.   Some of it was.

3       Q.   CTR funded top scientists from around the

4   country?

5       A.   Yes.

6       Q.   And some of the people who were funded by the

7   TIRC were also funded by groups like the National

8   Institute of Health or the National Cancer Institute,

9   right?

10       A.   Yes, they were.

11        Q.   Some pretty notable scientists received grants

12   from TIRC and CTR?

13       A.   Yes, several Nobel Prize winners.

14       Q.   Well, you say "several." There are actually

15   ten of them, right?

16       A.   Today there are, yes.

17       Q.   Baruj Benacerraf was one, right?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   Bruce Beutler, M.D.?

20       A.   I haven't memorized the names of all the Nobel

21    Prize winners, but --

22       Q.   Just tell me the ones you recognize.

23            Aaron Ciechanover?

24       A.   I don't recognize the name.

25       Q.   Stanley Cohen? 3745

1        A.   Recognize that one.

2       Q.   Paul Greengard?

3       A.   Recognize that.

4       Q.   Carol Greider?

5       A.   Don't recognize that one.

6       Q.   Avram Hershko.

7       A.   No.

8       Q.   Louis Ignarro?

9       A.   Okay.

10       Q.   Ferid Murad?

11        A.   Okay.

12       Q.   And Harold Varmus?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   All Nobel Prize winners who did research that

15   was funded by or received grants from TIRC/CTR, right?

16       A.   Not their Nobel Prize winning work, but they

17   received grants from CTR during their career, yes.

18       Q.   Well, you're not claiming that the work by

19   these Nobel Prize winners was fraudulent, are you?

20       A.   Not at all.

21        Q.   In fact, your former institution, Roswell Park,

22   received CTR funding from the 1950s all the way through

23   to 1992, right?

24       A.   That's correct.

25       Q.   And no one from TIRC ever interfered with that 3746

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=612
1   research, did they?

2       A.   No.

3       Q.   Your predecessor at Roswell Park was a

4   well-known scientist by the name of Fred Bock, right?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   He was a well-respected cancer researcher?

7       A.   Yes, he was.

8       Q.   He did a lot of research on smoking and health

9   issues, didn't he?

10       A.   That's right.

11        Q.   And he worked with the federal government's

12   National Cancer Institute Tobacco Working Group, right?

13       A.   He did.

14       Q.   And he also conducted research that was funded

15   by CTR, didn't he?

16       A.   In the '50s, that's correct.

17       Q.   And with that CTR funding, he looked at what

18   was in cigarette smoke to try to identify specific

19   compounds, right?

20       A.   In the '50s, that's true.

21        Q.   All right. And you're not saying Dr. Bock of

22   the Roswell Park -- of Roswell Park was somehow part of

23   the conspiracy, are you?

24       A.   No, Dr. Bock was not.

25       Q.   And Dr. Bock wasn't part of a 50-year coverup? 3747

1        A.   No, sir. He uncovered a lot of the facts.

2       Q.   And you're certainly not saying that any of

3   Dr. Bock's research was fraudulent, are you?

4       A.   No, sir.

5       Q.   Now, TIRC funded research on nicotine being

6   addictive, didn't they?

7       A.   They did. Some of it was.

8       Q.   And the results of some of that research was

9   published, right?

10       A.   Some was.

11        Q.   Well, you've seen some of it that was published

12   on nicotine being addictive, right?

13       A.   I've seen some of the statements that have

14   CTR-funded research. Some of it was on nicotine and

15   addiction.

16            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

17            THE COURT: Yes.

18            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

19            MR. WALKER: Sure.

20   BY MR. WALKER:

21        Q.   Let's look at one of the publications that we

22   were just talking about. You're familiar with the

23   American Journal of Psychiatry, right?

24       A.   Yes, I am.

25       Q.   And the article that I've handed you, 3748

1    "Addictive Aspects in Heavy Cigarette Smoking," you've

2   seen that article before; have you not?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=613
3       A.   I have.

4       Q.   It's from -- looks like it was published in the

5    1962, 1963 edition of the American Journal of

6   Psychiatry, right?

7       A.   1963.

8       Q.   '63. Okay.

9       A.   Yeah.

10       Q.   Thank you.

11        A.   No problem.

12       Q.   By the way, the American Journal of Psychiatry

13   is a peer-reviewed journal published by the American

14   Psychiatric Association, right?

15       A.   Yes.

16       Q.   Okay. You already told me that you've seen

17   this article. You must have then taken it into

18   consideration in reaching your opinions and giving your

19   testimony, right?

20       A.   Yes, I did.

21             MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I would like to

22       display this American Journal of Psychiatry article

23       from 1963.

24            THE COURT: All right.

25            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor. 3749

1            THE COURT: All right. You may.

2   BY MR. WALKER:

3       Q.   So here we see the cover. It looks like it's

4   Volume 119, Hanover, New Hampshire. And this is the

5   article we were just talking about, right?

6       A.   That's right.

7       Q.   All right. Let's turn to the first page there.

8   And I want to go down to --1 guess it's one of the

9   first footnotes there. Tell me if I read this

10   incorrectly.

11             "This work was supported in part by grants from

12   the American Cancer Society and the Tobacco Industry

13   Research Committee."

14            Did I read that correctly?

15       A.   You did.

16       Q.   That's the TIRC, right?

17       A.   That's correct.

18       Q.   Okay. Let's look at what was published in this

19   article that was supported by research from TIRC.

20   "Nicotine is an active agent, though not necessarily the

21    only noxious agent, in tobacco. It appears to have

22   certain addictive quality."

23            Did I read that correctly?

24       A.   You did.

25       Q.   Okay. Let's turn to the next page. 3750

1        A.   Okay.

2       Q.   Left column near the top.

3             "Thus, considerable evidence suggests that true

4   physical dependence may develop to tobacco."

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=614
5            Did I read that correctly?

6       A.   Yes.

7       Q.   All right. Let's turn to the summary and

8   conclusions so we don't have to go through the entire

9   document. Let's look at the second conclusion in this

10   TIRC-funded publication article.

11             "Heavy cigarette smokers thus appear to be true

12   addicts, showing not only social habituation but mild

13   physiologic withdrawal effects."

14            Did I read that correctly?

15       A.   You did.

16       Q.   By the way, this article using that term

17    "addicts" with respect to heavy smokers in 1963, that

18   would have been about 25 years before the

19   Surgeon General's 1988 report on addiction, right?

20       A.   True.

21        Q.   And this 1963 paper that was funded by TIRC

22   stating that nicotine was addictive, that would have

23   been available to the Surgeon General a year later,

24   right?

25       A.   Yes. 3751

1        Q.   Nevertheless, the Surgeon General concluded in

2    1964 that nicotine was not addictive, right?

3       A.   Using the World Health Organization definition

4   that required intoxication.

5       Q.   What we referred to earlier as the classic

6   definition?

7       A.   I think Mr. Johnston used that term.

8       Q.   Okay. Now, this article was actually cited in

9   the 1988 Surgeon General's report, wasn't it?

10       A.   Yes. I'm thinking earlier reports as well.

11        Q.   Now, moving back to TIRC and CTR. They funded

12   about 500 million dollars in research, right?

13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   Over 6,000 articles were published as a result

15   of CTR research?

16       A.   That's correct.

17       Q.   Most of them in peer-reviewed journals?

18       A.   Correct.

19       Q.   Professional journals like the Journal of the

20   American Medical Association, right?

21        A.   Correct.

22       Q.   And six or seven hundred of those articles that

23   were funded -- published as a result of CTR and TIRC

24   research, six to seven hundred of them ended up being

25   cited in Surgeon General reports, right? 3752

1        A.   Correct. About 10 percent are on smoking and

2   health.

3       Q.   Now, TIRC and CTR also funded millions of

4   dollars in grants to researchers and research

5   institutions, not just in the United States, but around

6   the world, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=615
7       A.   Yes. I surveyed some of the recipients.

8       Q.   Including individuals and institutions right

9   here in Florida, right?

10       A.   That's right.

11        Q.   The University of Florida?

12       A.   Correct.

13       Q.   Florida State University?

14       A.   Yes.

15       Q.   The University of Miami?

16       A.   Correct.

17       Q.   University of South Florida?

18       A.   Yes.

19       Q.   Now, you're familiar with the "Tobacco:

20   Experimental and Clinical Studies" by Larson, Haag, and

21    Silvette, right?

22       A.   Right. Talked about that green monster.

23       Q.   The green monster.

24            And that was 1961, right ?

25       A.   That's when it was published; that's correct. 3753

1        Q.   Now, you mentioned that the green monster is

2   called the green monster partly because it has a green

3   cover, right?

4       A.   That's right. It's a thick book.

5       Q.   But -- that's the monster part. It's a

6   monster-size book, right?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   Okay. And that book was funded by the TIRC;

9   was it not?

10       A.   Partially. And American Tobacco.

11        Q.   And the first volume was initially published in

12    1961, right?

13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   That's a book that reports on -- reviews and

15   reports on more than 6,000 articles on experimental and

16   clinical smoking and health studies, right?

17       A.   It has the abstracts of those articles. No

18   conclusions.

19       Q.   It was a collection of articles that were

20   available in the published literature, right?

21        A.   True.

22       Q.   And they didn't editorialize on what the

23   articles meant. They put it all together in the green

24   monster and let the reader review it and decide what

25   those articles meant, right? 3754

1        A.   It's just a collection of abstracts, correct.

2       Q.   Now, let's put this in a little bit of context.

3            50 years ago, at the time of the green monster,

4   you couldn't pull up Google and Google smoking and

5   health issues, could you?

6       A.   No.

7       Q.   All right. You couldn't get a list from

8   Google of all the articles that might be appropriate or

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=616
9   use any kind of internet search engine to find out what

10   all the articles were that addressed that topic, could

11    you?

12       A.   No. Google didn't exist then.

13       Q.   But this compendium, this green monster,

14   provided researchers, scientists, medical doctors,

15   public health officials, and others with a tool to

16   identify the articles that might be of interest as

17   they're reviewing issues relating to "Tobacco"

18   Experimental and Clinical Studies," right?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   Then those people could go to the library,

21    decide what they wanted to see, and get the full

22   article, and make whatever conclusions they wanted to

23   make; is that right?

24       A.   Only the published research, yes.

25       Q.   All right. I am reliably informed that while 3755

1   we don't have a green monster with the green cover, I've

2   got a copy of the green monster. This is about -- when

3   you were gesturing with your hands about the size of it,

4   this is consistent with that, right?

5       A.   Yes, sir.

6       Q.   Okay.

7            MR. UITERWYK: I don't want a copy of --1

8       don't want a copy of the whole thing.

9            MR. WALKER: I won't give you the whole thing.

10            I won't give you the whole thing either,

11        Doctor.

12            May I approach?

13    THE COURT: Yes.

14 BY MR. WALKER:

15       Q.   All right. This is just a portion of it that I

16   want to ask you about.

17       A.   Okay.

18       Q.   Let's see. Among --1 want to take a look at

19   the Table of Contents. It looks like -- let me see.

20            MR. WALKER: Do you have this on the -- all

21        right.

22            Any objection to pulling up the Table of

23       Contents of the green monster?

24            MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

25            MR. WALKER: Okay. 3756

1   BY MR. WALKER:

2       Q.   All right. So instead of giving you the big --

3   the big book or a copy of the book, I just want to ask

4   you first about some of the topics that are addressed in

5   the green monster. And one of those topics is the

6   effect of tobacco and smoking on the human organism as a

7   whole, right?

8       A.   Correct. Longevity.

9       Q.   And then there is another whole chapter, I

10   guess you could call it, on tobacco and disease, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=617
11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   Then there's another on smoking and lung

13   cancer, right?

14       A.   Smoking in relationship to specific diseases,

15   including lung cancer.

16       Q.   Oh, I see. You're right. Tobacco in relation

17   to specific diseases, and there's a list of different

18   diseases, and one of them is lung cancer, right?

19       A.   That's right.

20       Q.   Okay. Now, the green monster also included and

21    organized and indexed articles on the subject of

22   nicotine, right?

23       A.   It did.

24       Q.   And there are articles on hypersensitivity to

25   nicotine? 3757

1        A.   Correct.

2       Q.   Tobacco habituation? The tobacco habit, right?

3       A.   Correct.

4       Q.   Some of the literature, it included -- said

5   that nicotine had addictive qualities, right?

6       A.   Some of it did.

7       Q.   It included medical opinions concerning tobacco

8   use, right?

9       A.   Correct.

10       Q.   And, in fact, in talking about the funding of

11    this book, the authors of this book gratefully

12   acknowledged support from the Tobacco Industry Research

13   Committee, right?

14       A.   They did.

15       Q.   Let's pull up that page.

16            By the way, you would agree that it was a

17   tremendous amount of work to assemble all of the

18   articles in the green monster, right?

19       A.   Sure.

20       Q.   Okay. All right. So here is what it says in

21    the preface. Tell me if I read this wrong.

22            "We gratefully acknowledge grant-in-aid support

23   from the Tobacco Industry Research Committee during the

24   final stages of this long project. We deem it only

25   proper to inform the reader that all responsibility for 3758

1   the data presented and views expressed herein, either

2   explicitly or implicitly, rests entirely upon the

3   authors. The Tobacco Industry Research Committee

4   support having been in accordance with its established

5   policy of leaving complete freedom of planning and

6   action to grant-in-aid recipients."

7            Did I read that correctly?

8       A.   You did.

9       Q.   Now, the green monster, at the time that it was

10   published, was the biggest and best compilation of

11    tobacco studies ever done, right?

12       A.   It was the biggest, I'll grant you that, up

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=618
13   through 1959.

14       Q.   It wasn't just the biggest; it was the biggest

15   and the best effort to date, as of that date, right?

16       A.   It was the biggest.

17       Q.   You've testified that it was also the best,

18   haven't you?

19       A.   I may have been asked that question. I

20   don't --1 don't remember being asked it.

21        Q.   You may have been asked and you may have

22   testified it was the biggest and the best, right?

23       A.   I don't dispute it.

24       Q.   Okay. It was a key research tool for the

25   Surgeon General's committee that produced the 1964 3759

1    Surgeon General's report, right?

2       A.   I think I testified that it was referenced in

3   the '64 Surgeon General's report.

4       Q.   I'm not asking you if it was referenced. I'm

5   asking you if it was a key research tool for the

6   Surgeon General's committee that produced the 1964

7   Surgeon General's report.

8       A.   Sure, among the other tools that were used.

9       Q.   The information in this compendium in the green

10   monster was not secret or hidden from the

11    Surgeon General's committee, was it?

12       A.   No, it was turned over to the committee.

13       Q.   It was affirmative -- turned over. It was

14   affirmatively turned over to them by TIRC on behalf of

15   the tobacco industry, right?

16       A.   Yes, sir.

17       Q.   And then in the 1964 Surgeon General's report,

18   the report specifically referenced the green monster as

19   one of the primary sources of information for that

20   report, correct?

21        A.   That's what I said, yes.

22       Q.   All right. So this is the 1964

23   Surgeon General's report. I'm not going to try to hand

24   you the whole thing unless you want it.

25       A.   No, I'm very familiar with it. 3760

1            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

2            THE COURT: Yes.

3            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

4            MR. WALKER: You're welcome.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6       Q.   All right. Sir, I've handed you a few pages

7   from the 1964 Surgeon General's report. Not the whole

8   book. Just the ones I want to ask you about.

9            And first of all, you --1 think you just said

10   you're obviously very familiar with the '64

11    Surgeon General's report, right?

12       A.   That's right. Working on the 50-year history

13   right now --

14       Q.   Okay.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=619
15       A.   -- of all the reports.

16       Q.   We talked about that earlier and you -- you

17   certainly took the Surgeon General's report into account

18   in giving your testimony and your opinions, right?

19       A.   Sure.

20            MR. WALKER: All right. Your Honor, I would

21        like to display page 14 of the '64 Surgeon General's

22       report.

23            MR. UITERWYK: I assume he's going to offer it

24       in evidence, Your Honor.

25            THE COURT: I don't know. 3761

1            MR. WALKER: I'm not going to offer anything --

2            THE COURT: He's not at this point.

3            MR. UITERWYK: If he's not -- if he's not

4       offering it in, Your Honor, he's going to publish

5       the document. He's publishing only parts of it

6       without offering it in.

7            THE COURT: Okay. So you have an objection?

8            MR. UITERWYK: Yes, Your Honor. Not in

9       evidence.

10            THE COURT: Okay.

11             MR. WALKER: I don't think it needs to be in

12       evidence for me to ask him about the basis of his

13       opinions, Your Honor.

14            THE COURT: Okay. Your objection is overruled.

15            MR. WALKER: Can we see page 14, please. Let's

16       just zoom in on that first paragraph there.

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q.   Tell me if I have this right, Dr. Cummings.

19             "As the primary duty of the committee was to

20   assess information about smoking and health, a major

21    general requirement was that of making the information

22   available. That requirement was met in three ways. The

23   first and most important was the bibliographic service

24   provided by the National Library of Medicine, as the

25   annotated monograph by Larson, Haag, and Silvette, 3762

1    compiled from more than 6,000 articles published in some

2    1200 journals up to and largely into 1959, was available

3   as a basic reference source. The National Library of

4   Medicine was requested to compile a bibliography by

5   author and by subject covering the world literature from

6    1958 to the present."

7            Did I read that correctly?

8       A.   That's right.

9       Q.   And the Surgeon General specifically thanked

10   them for the contribution of the green monster; is that

11    right?

12       A.   Yes, they did.

13       Q.   The green monster was so comprehensive that

14   when the Surgeon General began putting together the

15   information for the 1964 report, in 1962, the

16   Surgeon General's office relied on this book for all

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=620
17   research prior to 1958, correct?

18       A.   Prior to 1958, the published literature, yes.

19       Q.   So up until 1958, the Surgeon General basically

20   said we don't even need to do that research pre 1958

21   because it's already been done in this green monster

22   that was paid for by TIRC, right?

23       A.   What research are you referring to? You mean

24   the published articles? Yes, they relied on the green

25   monster as the source for published research prior to 3763

1    1958.

2       Q.   And the tobacco companies didn't stop funding

3   this work in 1964 when the Surgeon General came out with

4   its report, did it?

5       A.   No, they did not. They continued to put out

6   updated versions of the green monster.

7       Q.   And the companies kept providing money to the

8   CTR, which, in turn, continued to fund Larson, Haag, and

9   Silvette, correct?

10       A.   That's right. They were already funding them

11    through American Tobacco.

12       Q.   Even though the conclusion of the

13   Surgeon General's report was adverse to the tobacco

14   company, they didn't take their money and go home, did

15   they?

16       A.   Go home where? I'm not sure I understand.

17       Q.   They didn't stop funding Larson, Haag, and

18   Silvette, did they?

19       A.   No, they continued to fund these abstracting of

20   the literature. They had a program called the Legal

21    Research Department. It was part of TIRC.

22       Q.   And Larson, Haag, and Silvette continued to

23   publish subsequent volumes in 1968, 1971, and 1975,

24   right?

25       A.   Yes, the industry tracked the published 3764

1   research.

2       Q.   All of that was publicly available, right?

3       A.   Well, those volumes were made publicly

4   available.

5       Q.   Those volumes were all available to the

6   Surgeon General, right?

7       A.   Sure.

8       Q.   And the Surgeon General reports that came out

9   in those years consistently referred to those materials,

10   right?

11        A.   They would reference all published literature,

12   yes.

13       Q.   Now, TIRC, and then later the CTR, they had a

14   Scientific Advisory Board, right?

15       A.   They did.

16       Q.   You mentioned that in your direct examination,

17   right?

18       A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=621
19       Q.   The members of CTR Scientific Advisory Board

20   were, in fact, reputable scientists, right?

21        A.   Yes.

22       Q.   They were experts in a variety of scientific

23   disciplines, correct?

24       A.   Yes, they were.

25       Q.   And they were not employed by the tobacco 3765

1   industry, were they?

2       A.   No, that's not entirely true. They received

3   payment for their service on the SAB, but they worked at

4   independent institutions that were part of the industry.

5       Q.   The members of the Scientific Advisory Board

6   were not members of the tobacco industry, were they?

7       A.   No, they weren't employed directly by the

8   tobacco industry. They did receive fees for their

9   service on the Scientific Advisory Board.

10       Q.   And they retained their affiliations with

11    whatever universities, medical, and scientific

12   organizations they came from, right?

13       A.   Yes, sir.

14       Q.   In other words, they didn't -- the Scientific

15   Advisory Board scientists didn't quit their day jobs,

16   did they?

17       A.   No.

18       Q.   They continued in their regular occupations

19   while also serving on the Scientific Advisory Board?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Now, the members of the Scientific Advisory

22   Board of TIRC and later CTR came from places like the

23   Institute for Cancer and Research -- the Institute for

24   Cancer and Research at Johns Hopkins, right?

25       A.   Yes. 3766

1        Q.   Members of the Scientific Advisory Board came

2   from places like Cornell University?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   The University of Pennsylvania?

5       A.   Correct.

6       Q.   Harvard?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   And the scientific director was Clarence Cook

9   Little, right?

10       A.   The first one, yeah.

11        Q.   You mentioned him in your examination. He had

12   been a president of the University of Michigan, right?

13       A.   Good school. Yeah.

14       Q.   You say it's a good school because it's your

15   alma mater, right?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   Okay. But he was also president of the

18   American Association for Cancer Research, wasn't he?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   He was a former managing director of the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=622
21    American Society for the Control of Cancer, right?

22       A.   That's right.

23       Q.   He was a member of the National Cancer

24   Institute Advisory Council?

25       A.   Correct. 3767

1        Q.   A member of the National Academy of Sciences?

2       A.   Yes.

3       Q.   All right. Now, I want to change topics and

4   talk a little bit about cigarette design now or at least

5   about some of the testimony you gave about cigarette

6   design.

7       A.   Okay.

8       Q.   You talked in your testimony about how

9   cigarettes are engineered and designed, but you,

10   yourself, have never designed a commercial cigarette,

11    have you?

12       A.   No.

13       Q.   All right. You don't have any formal training

14   in cigarette design?

15       A.   I'm not aware of how you get formal training

16   other than work for the companies.

17       Q.   You're not an expert in nicotine extraction

18   from tobacco?

19       A.   I'm familiar with the process, but I am not

20   a --1 would not consider that something I do for my day

21   job.

22       Q.   I want you to try to focus on my question. I'm

23   not asking you what you're familiar with.

24            You are not an expert in nicotine extraction

25   from tobacco? 3768

1        A.   No.

2       Q.   You've never designed a cigarette filter?

3       A.   Never designed a cigarette or cigarette filter.

4       Q.   You've never designed a cigarette with or

5   without ventilation?

6       A.   Wrong. I have.

7       Q.   When did you do that?

8       A.   We've done experiments where we have engineered

9   the filters to see what the effect --

10       Q.   Try to stay with me, Dr. Cummings.

11            When did you do that?

12            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, could he finish?

13            THE COURT: Yes, let him finish his statement.

14       You can put another statement to him -- another

15       question to him.

16   BY MR. WALKER:

17       Q.   When did you -- when are you telling us you

18   designed a cigarette with or without ventilation?

19   W-h-e-n.

20       A.   2009.

21        Q.   2009?

22       A.   Yeah. We've been doing those experiments on

23   cigarette ventilation.

24       Q.   Okay. But you were asked in 2011 whether

25   you've ever designed a cigarette with or without 3769

1   ventilation; were you not?

2       A.   I don't remember.

3       Q.   Do you remember testifying in the Tullo case?

4       A.   Sure.

5       Q.   All right. Let's take a look at what you said

6   in 2011.

7            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

8            THE COURT: Yes.

9            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

10            MR. WALKER: Sure.

11    BY MR. WALKER:

12       Q.   All right. I've handed you a copy of your

13   testimony at the Tullo trial.

14            You remember that trial, don't you?

15       A.   Sure.

16       Q.   And you testified there, just like you are

17   today, under oath from the witness box with a court

18   reporter, right?

19       A.   Yes.

20       Q.   All right. Let's take a look at page 2406.

21        A.   Okay.

22       Q.   I want to look at lines 3 through 5. You see

23   that?

24       A.   I do.

25       Q.   "Question: You've never designed a cigarette 3770

1   with or without ventilation?

2            "Answer: No."

3            Did I read that correctly?

4       A.   You read it correctly.

5       Q.   Okay. Now --

6            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, may he explain the

7       answer?

8            THE COURT: Sir?

9            MR. UITERWYK: Is he permitted to explain why

10       the difference in the answer?

11             MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I'm doing the best I

12       can to move through this cross.

13            MR. UITERWYK: But -

14            THE COURT: Your objection is overruled.

15   BY MR. WALKER:

16       Q.   All right. Now, the truth is, you've never

17   designed a cigarette at all, have you?

18       A.   I have not manufactured a cigarette for

19   commercial purposes. I've engineered cigarettes with

20   design features for testing in the laboratory.

21        Q.   Do you remember being asked whether you've ever

22   designed a cigarette at all and saying that you haven't?

23       A.   I think it was in the context of for commercial

24   purposes, as I recall.

25       Q.   You remember testifying in a case called 3771

1   Hargroves, don't you?

2       A.   I do.

3       Q.   That was right here in this courthouse; was it

4   not?

5       A.   Yes, it was. And across the hall, I believe.

6       Q.   A couple of years ago sound right?

7       A.   Yeah.

8            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

9            THE COURT: Yes.

10            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

11             MR. WALKER: Sure.

12   BY MR. WALKER:

13       Q.   So when you were right across the hall giving

14   testimony in the Hargroves case, you were under oath

15   then just as you are today, right?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   And there was a court reporter taking down your

18   every word, right?

19       A.   Yes, sir.

20       Q.   All right. Let's have a look at page 1259,

21    lines 4 through 6.

22            "Question: And you have never designed a

23   cigarette at all, correct?

24            "Answer: That's true."

25            Did I read that correctly? 3772

1        A.   Yes, but the context was over commercial

2   cigarettes, the prior question and answer.

3       Q.   Now, you hold no patents in cigarette design or

4   construction, do you?

5       A.   No, I don't.

6       Q.   Now, I guess it was Wednesday you talked about

7   a testing lab that you had at Roswell, right?

8       A.   Still do.

9       Q.   Still do?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   You showed some pictures of the freezer and

12   some boxes and all that, right?

13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   Okay. Now, that was a lab that you oversaw,

15   right?

16       A.   Still do.

17       Q.   You oversaw the director of that lab?

18       A.   That's right.

19       Q.   And the director of that lab is a Ph.D., right?

20       A.   That's right.

21        Q.   And he's the one who has unique experience to

22   do the work that he's doing, right?

23       A.   What work are you referring to?

24       Q.   The work that's done by the director of the

25   lab. 3773

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=625
1        A.   Well, there is a director of the lab as part of

2   my research grant that I oversee from the National

3   Cancer Institute and, you know, he directs that aspect

4   of the research that we do.

5       Q.   Yeah. He's the one who has the unique

6   experience to do the work that he's doing in the lab,

7   right?

8       A.   He certainly does have unique experience, as I

9   do.

10       Q.   He's the one who is actually doing the physical

11    research in the lab, right?

12       A.   I've been involved with physical research, but,

13   yes, he does more of the physical research than I do.

14       Q.   His Ph.D. is in biobehavioral medicine, right?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   You don't have a Ph.D. in biobehavioral

17   medicine, do you?

18       A.   No, my Ph.D. is in health behavior.

19       Q.   All right. Now, there are a number of

20   scientists and M.D.s, medical doctors, who work in that

21    lab, right?

22       A.   There is a number of scientists who work in

23   that lab.

24       Q.   And it's their job to do the research in the

25   lab, the actual research in the lab, right? 3774

1        A.   It's all our jobs.

2       Q.   Your job--well, your job was to oversee the

3   research, right?

4       A.   Well, I'm the principal investigator. So I'm

5   the director of the research grant that provides the

6   resources for it. And certainly my responsibility is to

7   oversee all the research under -- under the grant that I

8   lead.

9       Q.   So when it comes to the physical research that

10   goes on at the lab, you're not the one doing it

11   primarily. Your job is to oversee that work, right?

12       A.   No, I've been involved in both aspects in the

13   lab, as well as overseeing the work in the lab.

14       Q.   All right. You still have your transcript from

15   the Tullo case?

16       A.   I do.

17       Q.   All right. From April 1st, 2011?

18       A.   Sure. What page?

19       Q.   2417.

20       A.   Okay.

21             MR. UITERWYK: Wait a minute. Let me get my

22       copy.

23            MR. WALKER: Sure. Take your time. Here you

24       go.

25            MR. UITERWYK: Thank you. 3775

1   BY MR. WALKER:

2       Q.   So I want to look at -- are you there -- or are

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=626
3   you at 2417?

4       A.   I am.

5       Q.   Okay. I would like to take a look at page --

6   at page -- let's see. 2417. Let's go from 6 to, oh,

7    14. Lines 6 through 14.

8       A.   All right.

9       Q.   "I'm talking about the physical research that

10   goes on in the lab. Your job is to oversee that, right?

11             "Answer: That's right.

12            "Question: You actually have people who come

13   in on a day-to-day basis and perform that research?

14            "Answer: True.

15             "Question: That is not your function?

16            "Answer: That's true."

17            Did I read that correctly?

18       A.   You did.

19            I don't do it on a day-to-day basis.

20       Q.   Now, let's talk about filters. You talked

21    quite a bit about filters in your examination, right?

22       A.   I did.

23       Q.   You would agree with me, wouldn't you, that

24   since 1964, probably even earlier, the public health

25   community in America has made it clear that the best 3776

1   thing smokers can do for their health is to quit

2   smoking, right?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   And they made that same recommendation to the

5   entire American public regardless of whether people were

6   smoking filtered or unfiltered cigarettes, correct?

7       A.   Told smokers the best thing you can do is

8   quit --

9       Q.   But-

10       A.   --or not start.

11        Q.   But if a smoker was going to continue to smoke

12   cigarettes, there was, in fact, a time in this country

13   when the public health community recommended that if

14   you're not going to quit, you should smoke a filtered

15   cigarette, right?

16       A.   So long as you don't compensate, yes.

17       Q.   Well -- all right. You don't dispute that the

18   public health community encouraged Reynolds and

19   Lorillard and other tobacco companies to develop

20   cigarettes with filters on them for decades, do you?

21        A.   I'm not familiar with any correspondence from

22   the federal government to Reynolds or Lorillard asking

23   them to develop filters. I'm not familiar with that.

24       Q.   You don't dispute -- try again.

25            You don't dispute that the public health 3777

1    community encouraged -- encouraged Reynolds, Lorillard,

2   and other cigarette companies to develop cigarettes with

3   filters on them for decades, do you? You don't dispute

4   that?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=627
5       A.   I just said I'm not familiar with any

6   correspondence between the federal government and the

7   manufacturers of the cigarettes to develop filters.

8   There were people who did say, if you're going to smoke,

9   you should probably be switching to a filtered

10   cigarette. I don't dispute that.

11        Q.   Can you translate that answer into a "yes" or

12   "no"?

13            You do or you do not dispute that the public

14   health community encouraged Reynolds and Lorillard and

15   other cigarette companies to develop cigarettes with

16   filters on them for decades?

17            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'm going to object

18       to the question as vague regarding the public health

19       community.

20            THE COURT: Okay. Sustained.

21    BY MR. WALKER:

22       Q.   Have you answered this question before?

23       A.   I have.

24       Q.   All right. And when you answered it before,

25   you said you don't dispute --3778

1            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, he didn't rephrase

2       the question.

3            THE COURT: Okay. He's asking another

4       question. Your objection's overruled.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6       Q.   You testified that you don't dispute that, do

7   you?

8       A.   I don't dispute it based on the explanation I

9   just gave.

10       Q.   All right.

11        A.   There were a few people that said that you

12   should, if you're going to continue to smoke, go to the

13   filter so long as you don't compensate.

14       Q.   The public health community encouraged

15   Reynolds, Lorillard, and other cigarette companies to

16   develop low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes over many

17   years, right?

18            MR. UITERWYK: Same objection, Your Honor.

19            THE COURT: Which is?

20            MR. UITERWYK: Vague, argumentative.

21             THE COURT: Sustained.

22   BY MR. WALKER:

23       Q.   Doctor, do you understand what the term "public

24   health community" means?

25       A.   No, I'm having a difficult time understanding 3779

1   what you're referring to.

2       Q.   Okay.

3       A.   I think you're referring to the Surgeon General

4   or federal government.

5       Q.   Actually, I just want to know if you know what

6   the term "public health community" means.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=628
7       A.   No.

8       Q.   You've testified here for -- this is day five

9   for you?

10       A.   Yes.

11        Q.   Four?

12       A.   Well, I started on Wednesday. As I said, I

13   spent a lot of time out in the hall while lawyers were

14   arguing.

15       Q.   And your degree is in public health, you said?

16       A.   That's right.

17       Q.   But you don't know what "public health

18   community" means?

19       A.   I'm not sure what you're referring to. I

20   wouldn't want to answer the wrong way, give a vague

21    answer --

22       Q.   Well, actually --

23       A.   -- that would come back and be used

24   inappropriately when I'm examined.

25       Q.   We've talked about a number of people already 3780

1   now who are in the public health community. You don't

2   know what that means?

3       A.   I'm asking for a clarification on your

4   question.

5       Q.   I'm asking you --

6            MR. UITERWYK: Objection. Argumentative.

7            THE COURT: Okay. Sustained.

8   BY MR. WALKER:

9       Q.   I'm asking you if anyone that you consider to

10   be in the public health community, by your own

11    definition as a person who has a degree in public

12   health.

13       A.   Sure.

14       Q.   Okay. Did anyone in the public health

15   community encourage Reynolds, Lorillard, and other

16   cigarette companies to develop low-tar and low-nicotine

17   cigarettes over a period of many years?

18       A.   Yes, based on that clarification.

19            MR. WALKER: May I approach the witness,

20       Your Honor?

21     THE COURT: Yes.

22 BY MR. WALKER:

23       Q.   So first -- just handed you a document, but I

24   guess I should ask you first, do you consider

25   Ernst Wynder to be a member of the public health 3781

1    community?

2       A.   Sure do.

3       Q.   No question in your mind about that, right?

4       A.   No question in my mind.

5       Q.   I've just handed you a magazine article from

6   TIME magazine from 1959, right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   And the article -- okay.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=629
9            And so the article is "Smoking and Cancer,"

10   right? Do you see that?

11        A.   Yes.

12       Q.   You've seen this article before, haven't you?

13       A.   I have.

14       Q.   And you're familiar with Dr. Wynder's comments

15   in this article; are you not?

16       A.   I am.

17       Q.   You took them into consideration in giving your

18   testimony and your opinions, right?

19       A.   Yes, sir.

20            MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I'd like to

21        display this TIME magazine article that quotes from

22       Dr. -- that refers to Dr. Wynder in 1959.

23            MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

24            THE COURT: All right. Give me a minute before

25       you put that up, please. 3782

1            Thank you. Go ahead.

2            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Judge.

3            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'm going to object

4       to showing the document. It's not in evidence.

5       It's not been offered in evidence.

6            THE COURT: Okay. Your objection's overruled.

7            MR. UITERWYK: Objection. Hearsay.

8            MR. WALKER: Let's take a look at page 73.

9       Let's zoom in, if we could, on the bottom area

10       there. All right.

11    BY MR. WALKER:

12       Q.   "Dr. Wynder despairs of persuading 55 million

13   Americans to quit the habit. But to make it safer, he

14   urges manufacturers to use low-tar tobaccos and the most

15   potent filters they can find."

16            Did I read that correctly?

17       A.   Right. In a -- about their compensation --

18       Q.   Ultimately, you agree with me that Dr. Wynder,

19   at least, is a member of the public health community,

20   right?

21        A.   Yeah.

22       Q.   Okay. All right. Until recently, in 2008, the

23   Federal Trade Commission, the FTC, directed tobacco

24   companies to use a smoking machine to measure the tar

25   yield of each brand of cigarettes, right? 3783

1        A.   Yes.

2            MR. UITERWYK: I thought he - are you finished

3       with the document, because I would like you to

4       read -- like the rest of that paragraph to be read

5       for the rule of completeness, please.

6            THE COURT: I need to see it first, unless you

7       have -- unless you don't have an objection to it.

8            (At the bench.)

9            MR. WALKER: I do have an objection. I just

10       don't think it's relevant to what was read.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=630
11             THE COURT: Okay. Let me read it.

12            All right. As far as the rule of completeness

13       is concerned, I'm going to ask that you publish it.

14            MR. WALKER: Will do.

15            (In open court.)

16            MR. WALKER: Just give me that whole paragraph.

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q.   "No smoker himself, Dr. Wynder despairs of

19   persuading 55 million Americans to quit the habit. But

20   to make it safer, he urges manufacturers to use low-tar

21    tobaccos and the most potent filters they can find. For

22   smokers themselves, he recommends to try to cut down,

23   inhale less, never smoke down to the butt, not more than

24   half of a king-sized cigarette, because 60 percent of

25   the tar is in the last half." 3784

1            All right. Now, until recently, in 2008, the

2   FTC directed -- I'm sorry. I asked you that one

3   already, but I don't know if I got an answer.

4            The FTC directed tobacco companies to use a

5   smoking machine to measure the tar yield of each brand

6   of cigarette until 2008, right?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   All right. In the 1960s, one of the things the

9   FTC wanted to do was to develop a standardized protocol

10   for machine-measured smoking to evaluate tar and

11    nicotine data, correct?

12       A.   Yes.

13       Q.   But before the FTC smoking machine went into

14   use, before it was required to be used, the tobacco

15   companies told the FTC that the machine would not

16   measure the actual tar and nicotine levels that human

17   smokers would actually get, correct?

18       A.   They did communicate that.

19       Q.   That the machine-measured smoking data might

20   not reflect the experience that actual smokers have in

21    smoking?

22       A.   It doesn't, yes.

23       Q.   Okay. Now, you've seen the cigarette

24   companies' actual submission to the federal government

25   about that, haven't you? 3785

1        A.   Yes, I have.

2       Q.   Okay. And you took that submission into

3   account in giving your testimony, right?

4       A.   Yes.

5            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

6            THE COURT: Yes.

7            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

8            MR. WALKER: Sure.

9   BY MR. WALKER:

10       Q.   Okay. So you've just been handed by me the FTC

11    submission that we were just talking about, right?

12       A.   Correct.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=631
13       Q.   It's from 1966, right?

14       A.   Correct.

15       Q.   Okay. This is the same report that you just

16   told me you reviewed and took into consideration in

17   giving your opinions, right?

18       A.   Yes, sir.

19            MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I'd like to

20       display the 1966 FTC submission.

21             THE COURT: Any objection, Mr. Uiterwyk?

22            MR. UITERWYK: No, Your Honor.

23            THE COURT: All right.

24   BY MR. WALKER:

25       Q.   Okay. Before the FTC -- there's the date, 3786

1    1966.

2            MR. WALKER: Let's jump, if we could, to the

3       last page of this document first. Just want

4       to maybe just zoom in on the "respectfully

5       submitted" and what's under it.

6   BY MR. WALKER:

7       Q.   You see there, Dr. Cummings, where it says,

8   "Respectfully submitted, the American Tobacco Company,

9   Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation, Liggett & Myers

10   Tobacco Company, Philip Morris, Incorporated, and

11    R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company," right?

12       A.   Correct.

13       Q.   Okay. Now, Lorillard isn't listed there,

14   right?

15       A.   No.

16       Q.   But that's because they did their own separate

17   submission on November 30th of that same year, right?

18       A.   That's correct.

19       Q.   And the Lorillard submission essentially joined

20   in with the other companies' submission we're about to

21    look at, right?

22       A.   Yes. They didn't agree with some of the other

23   things the companies were doing.

24       Q.   Okay. Let's go back to Reynolds and the other

25   companies' submission to the FTC. And I want to turn 3787

1   first to page 1.

2       A.   Okay.

3            MR. WALKER: Just let me have the ELMO.

4            MS. MCKINNIS: Technical glitch.

5            MR. WALKER: It happens.

6   BY MR. WALKER:

7       Q.   All right. Let's be clear. The same document.

8   You see that?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   All right. First page. So there's a heading

11    here, "What is Being Measured," right?

12       A.   Correct.

13       Q.   And it says, "Whether you call it tar or

14   particulate matter (PM), the so-called" -- is it O-g-g

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=632
15   or Ogg? What-

16       A.   Ogg.

17       Q.   Ogg.

18             "The so-called Ogg method employing the

19   Cambridge filter seeks to determine the non-vapor

20   material in cigarette smoke as generated in the

21    automatic standardized smoking of a cigarette by a

22   machine, not by a human being, according to necessary

23   prescribed standard technical directions."

24            Did I read that right?

25       A.   Correct. 3788

1        Q.   Now, that -- the Ogg method, that was the FTC

2   machine, right?

3       A.   That's right.

4       Q.   Okay. Now, it goes on to say in the next page,

5   under the heading "What is Not Being Measured" -- you

6   see that?

7       A.   Yes.

8       Q.   Okay. So the company submission to the FTC

9   goes on to say, "The Ogg method does not measure the

10   volume of smoke or the PM" -- particulate matter -- "or

11    nicotine in the volume of smoke that any human being

12   will draw from smoking any particular cigarette."

13            Did I read that correctly?

14       A.   You did.

15       Q.   And then, of course, "human being" is

16   underlined, right?

17       A.   That's right.

18       Q.   Okay. Okay. And then below that it says, "No

19   two human smokers smoke in the same way. No individual

20   smoker always smokes in the same fashion."

21             Did I read that correctly?

22       A.   You did.

23       Q.   All right.

24            MR. WALKER: Now, we can turn it off.

25   BY MR. WALKER: 3789

1        Q.   Now, in spite of that submission, the Federal

2   Trade Commission decided to adopt the Ogg method, the

3   FTC machine, anyway, right?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   And actually announced that in a press release

6   in 1967?

7       A.   That's right.

8       Q.   You've seen that press release before, haven't

9   you?

10       A.   I have.

11             MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

12            THE COURT: Yes.

13            MR. WALKER: Okay.

14            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

15            THE COURT: All right.

16            MR. WALKER: All right. Let's display this

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=633
17       one.

18   BY MR. WALKER:

19       Q.   Okay. So we see at the top, "News Release,

20   Federal Trade Commission." And then just below that --

21             MR. WALKER: If we could capture also a little

22       bit below that.

23   BY MR. WALKER:

24       Q.   There's the date, Tuesday, August 1st, 1967.

25            Do you see that? 3790

1        A.   Yes.

2       Q.   All right. And so this is the press release we

3   were just talking about where the FTC is telling the

4   public about this new test, right?

5       A.   Correct.

6       Q.   And you would agree with me that in this press

7   release, the FTC makes some statements that are

8   remarkably similar to what the tobacco companies said in

9   their submission, right?

10       A.   They do.

11        Q.   Okay. Let's look at one of those. It's

12   already highlighted on the screen.

13            MR. WALKER: If we could just zoom in.

14   BY MR. WALKER:

15       Q.   "No test can precisely duplicate conditions of

16   actual human smoking."

17            Did I read that correctly?

18       A.   Correct.

19       Q.   And that's exactly what the tobacco companies

20   had told the FTC about the FTC method, right?

21        A.   That's right.

22       Q.   You would agree that the FTC knew when they

23   adopted this method that they would get an average, but

24   that the machine would not tell precisely what an

25   individual would get, right? 3791

1        A.   Would give -- you know, under standardized

2   smoking parameters, it would give a measure for the

3   cigarette, but not for the individual necessarily.

4       Q.   All right. Same press release on the second

5   page.

6            MR. WALKER: May I have the second page,

7       please?

8   BY MR. WALKER:

9       Q.   First full paragraph goes on to say, "In

10   determining the testing method, the commission has not

11    attempted to gauge the test to the amount of smoke or

12   tar and nicotine which the, quote, average smoker will

13   draw from any particular cigarette. No two human

14   smokers smoke in the same way. No individual smoker

15   always smokes in the same fashion."

16            Did I read that right?

17       A.   You did.

18       Q.   And a little bit below that, it goes on, "The

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=634
19   Cambridge filter method does not and cannot measure

20   these many variations in human smoking habits."

21             Right?

22       A.   Correct.

23       Q.   That's what the tobacco companies told the FTC,

24   right?

25       A.   That's what was well known, yes. 3792

1        Q.   Okay. A little bit below that, "The purpose of

2   testing is not to determine the amount of tar and

3   nicotine inhaled by any human smoker, but rather to

4   determine the amount of tar and nicotine generated when

5   a cigarette is smoked by a machine in accordance with

6   the prescribed method."

7            Did I read that correctly?

8       A.   You did.

9       Q.   All right. And, again, despite these known

10   limitations, the FTC adopted this Ogg method, right?

11        A.   Sure.

12            I can explain why they adopted the method.

13   There was rationale for it.

14       Q.   The FTC -- the method that the FTC adopted was

15   actually derived from a methodology that had originally

16   been recommended by Lorillard scientists, right?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   Now, I want to get back to filters.

19            You're familiar with the 1979 Surgeon General's

20   report, right?

21        A.   Sure.

22       Q.   All right. I've got the whole report here.

23   And I'll make the same deal with you. I'm going to hand

24   you the part I want to ask you about, but if you need

25   the rest of it, you let me know. Okay? 3793

1        A.   Okay. I don't have any problems getting the

2   whole report.

3       Q.   What's that?

4       A.   You can give me the whole report if you like.

5       Q.   Is that what you prefer to have?

6       A.   Sure. I think all the reports ought to come

7   in.

8       Q.   Just remember, you asked me to give you this.

9       A.   Sure. That's fine.

10            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

11             THE WITNESS: Thank you.

12            MR. WALKER: Sure thing.

13            THE COURT: Excuse me a minute.

14            Okay. Thank you. All right.

15            MR. WALKER: Thank you, Judge.

16   BY MR. WALKER:

17       Q.   I'd ask you to turn to Roman XII.

18       A.   Okay.

19       Q.   Should be towards the front.

20       A.   I'm there.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=635
21        Q.   That was good.

22            Okay. First of all, let me ask you, you're

23   certainly familiar with this report, right?

24       A.   I am.

25       Q.   You took it into consideration in giving your 3794

1   testimony and your opinions, right?

2       A.   True.

3            MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I would like to

4       display page XII of this report, Roman XII.

5            MR. UITERWYK: Should probably display the

6       whole document in evidence, Your Honor.

7            THE COURT: Okay. Any objection to showing it?

8            MR. UITERWYK: No, Your Honor.

9            THE COURT: Okay.

10   BY MR. WALKER:

11        Q.   Okay. I want you to follow along with me and

12   tell me if I get any of this wrong.

13       A.   Okay.

14       Q.   "By 1964, at the time of the Surgeon General's

15   first report, the market share of filter cigarettes had

16   reached 60 percent." Then "Appendix."  "The average,

17   quote, tar, end quote, delivery of a cigarette was about

18   23 milligrams. The average nicotine delivery was

19   approximately 1.3 milligrams. Chapter 14 and Appendix.

20            "Since then, the average, quote, tar, end

21    quote, and nicotine deliveries have continued to

22   decline. This was encouraged by a series of government

23   actions beginning in 1966. In that year, the Public

24   Health Service issued its finding that, quote, the

25   preponderance of scientific evidence strongly suggests 3795

1   that the lower the tar and nicotine content of a

2   cigarette, the less harmful will be the effect."

3            Did I read that correctly?

4       A.   You did. You read it correctly.

5            I can explain it, if you'd like.

6       Q.   Well, I want to move on, actually, to page XIV.

7       A.   All right. I'm there.

8       Q.   You're there?

9       A.   Uh-huh. (Indicates affirmatively.)

10       Q.   Okay. Can you see on your screen where I'm

11    referring to?

12       A.   Sure, I can see here.

13       Q.   "The preponderance of scientific evidence

14   continues, as in 1966, to suggest that cigarettes with

15   lower tar and nicotine are less hazardous."

16            Did I read that correctly?

17       A.   You did.

18       Q.   And this is the 1979 report, right?

19       A.   Correct.

20       Q.   Okay. And then a little bit below that, "They

21    should be warned that in shifting to a less-hazardous

22   cigarette, they may, in fact, increase their hazard if

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=636
23   they begin smoking more cigarettes or inhaling more

24   deeply."

25            That's what the Surgeon General said in 1979, 3796

1   right?

2       A.   Yes. They got it wrong, but that's what they

3   said.

4       Q.   Now, the Surgeon General's report about the

5   preponderance of scientific evidence, that's scientific

6   evidence including studies that occurred before then,

7   right?

8       A.   Sure. I mean, they're reviews of the

9   scientific evidence. So they were looking at the

10   handful of studies that had come out, because low-tar

11    cigarettes really had just been introduced in the early

12   '70s.

13       Q.   Okay. But Dr. Wynder -- we talked about

14   Dr. Wynder earlier, right?

15       A.   You did.

16       Q.   And you confirmed with me that Dr. Wynder is

17   part of the public health community?

18       A.   I did.

19       Q.   Okay. He's the one who did the mouse skin

20   painting studies, right, in the '50s?

21        A.   He did mouse skin painting experiments in the

22   '50s, that's true, among others.

23       Q.   He wrote an article in 1970 called "The

24   Epidemiology of Lung Cancer," right?

25       A.   Yes. 3797

1        Q.   That was published in the Journal of the

2   American Medical Association, right?

3       A.   Yes, sir.

4       Q.   Sometimes people refer to that as JAMA?

5       A.   Correct.

6            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

7            THE COURT: Yes.

8            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

9            MR. WALKER: Sure.

10   BY MR. WALKER:

11        Q.   All right. And this is -- what I've just

12   handed you is the article we've been talking about,

13   right?

14       A.   Yes.

15       Q.   You've seen this before, and you've taken it

16   into consideration in giving your opinions and

17   testimony, right?

18       A.   Yes, sir.

19            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, at this time, I would

20       like to publish the JAMA article from 1970 by

21        Dr. Wynder.

22            MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

23            THE COURT: All right.

24   BY MR. WALKER:

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=637
25       Q.   Okay. So right at the top there it says 3798

1    "JAMA." And you'll understand, if I say "JAMA," I'm

2   referring to the Journal of the American Medical

3   Association?

4       A.   Yes.

5       Q.   All right. Thank you.

6            And the title there, "The Epidemiology of Lung

7   Cancer." And Dr. Wynder is the first in a series of

8   authors listed, right?

9       A.   Correct.

10       Q.   Okay. Let's take a look at just the top part

11    there.

12            "New trends in this study show that there is a

13   decrease in relative risk for those patients developing

14   lung cancer ten years after they have switched to filter

15   cigarettes, possibly due to the lower tar content in

16   filter cigarettes smoked by these patients."

17            Did I read that correctly?

18       A.   Yes, that was the hypothesis -- proven wrong.

19   But that was the hypothesis or the speculation.

20       Q.   Well, he doesn't say anything about a

21    hypothesis, does he?

22       A.   No.

23       Q.   It says, "New trends in this study show,"

24   right?

25       A.   No, no. He says "possibly." He's speculating. 3799

1        Q.   You're talking about the second half of the

2   sentence?

3       A.   Yes.

4       Q.   Okay. The first half of the sentence says,

5    "New trends in this study show that there is a decrease

6   in relative risk for those patients developing lung

7   cancer ten years after they have switched to filter

8   cigarettes."

9            That's not a hypothesis, right?

10       A.   No, that's not a hypothesis. He did find that.

11             MR. UITERWYK: Can you read the rest of the

12       paragraph, please, rest of that sentence?

13   BY MR. WALKER:

14       Q.   Okay. The rest of the sentence is, "possibly

15   due to the lower tar content in filter cigarettes smoked

16   by these patients."

17            That's the part I just read a second ago,

18   right?

19       A.   Correct.

20       Q.   Okay. Now -- and Dr. Wynder, I think you told

21    me earlier, was not part of any 50-year coverup, right?

22       A.   No, sir.

23       Q.   Okay. That would be true even in 1970 when

24   this article was published, right?

25       A.   No, but there were issues with the ability to 3800

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=638
1   look at the effects of low-tar cigarettes --

2       Q.   Let's take a look --

3       A.   -- at that time.

4       Q.   Let's take a look at the last page of that same

5   document.

6       A.   Sure.

7       Q.   All right.  "Since filter cigarettes tend to be

8   lower in tar than non-filter cigarettes, the results

9   suggest that a reduction in tar yield of a given

10   strength will be associated with a decreased risk for

11    lung cancer unless the smoker compensates for the lower

12   tar dosage by smoking more cigarettes."

13            Did I read that correctly?

14       A.   Yes.

15       Q.   And that's what Dr. Wynder said in 1970, right?

16       A.   That's what he said. He didn't take account of

17   the fact that people could smoke the same number of

18   cigarettes and just take bigger puffs, a bigger volume

19   of smoke.

20       Q.   Who didn't take account of that?

21        A.   Dr. Wynder in this study, as well as the other

22   studies that came out in this period.

23       Q.   You're also familiar with Dr. Michael A.H.

24   Russell, right?

25       A.   Yes, I am. 3801

1        Q.   And you're familiar with an article that

2   Dr. Russell wrote in 1974 called "Realistic Goals for

3   Smoking and Health: A Case for Safer Smoking," right?

4       A.   I am.

5            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

6            THE WITNESS: Thank you.

7            MR. WALKER: Sure.

8            MR. UITERWYK: I am going to object and would

9       like to approach.

10            THE COURT: All right.

11             (At the bench.)

12            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, in this whole line

13       of questioning, the presenting of these articles,

14       these are hearsay, obviously, number one.

15            Number two, he's using the doctor and

16       publishing certain portions of stuff. I have no

17       opportunity to cross-examine the person who wrote

18       this article. I have no opportunity to explain what

19       flaws there may be in the article.

20            THE COURT: Right.

21             MR. UITERWYK: I have no - basically, what

22       they're getting in is, they're getting hearsay in

23       through the back door. They're not even admitting

24       the articles. They're just showing them to the

25       jury. And then Dr. Cummings is trying to explain 3802

1        it, and then he's not allowed to explain it, what

2       the flaws in the article may be.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=639
3            THE COURT: Okay. Well, experts can take into

4       consideration -- this is what experts do. They read

5       materials and they use it in forming their opinions.

6       They can't -- you can't use the expert as a vehicle

7       to introduce documents. But if -- if an expert

8       takes into account documents in forming his opinion,

9       then counsel is free to ask him about the

10       document -- the document itself that he's using to

11        form his opinion.

12            It is -- there is no question that it's

13       hearsay, but experts rely upon hearsay in forming

14       their opinions. They do that every day.

15            You'll have an opportunity to look at these

16       and -- and I'm not suggesting that this is the only

17       way to do it, but you may certainly be free to say

18       Mr. Walker referred to paragraph whatever on page

19       such and such, now I want you to take a look at

20       paragraph -- Mr. Walker referred to paragraph 10,

21        and I want you to refer to paragraph 11.

22            You agree with that, Mr. Walker?

23            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor, it happens that

24       way all the time.

25            MR. UITERWYK: Yeah. Well, first of all, it 3803

1        doesn't happen all the time, even with the articles

2       being presented to him in this manner, number one.

3            Number two, these documents have not been

4       produced to us beforehand. I'm going to be doing

5       redirect this afternoon. There's no way that I can

6       review them.

7            THE COURT: Well, this is the first time you've

8       made that objection.

9            MR. UITERWYK: The final argument, the main

10       argument that I have, Your Honor, is that they have

11        not established these articles being authoritative.

12       He cannot do it without -- I've made the objection

13       and you ruled on it.

14            Finally, it's getting to the point where it's

15       just going ad nauseam and I had to approach the

16       bench on it.

17            THE COURT: The witness has already testified

18       that he's relied upon this information in forming

19       his opinion. If he didn't rely upon it, then he

20       would have to ask him whether or not he regards it

21        as authoritative.

22            MR. UITERWYK: Did he consider this article,

23       but not in forming his opinion, because -- what the

24       question, I believe, was was not that he relied on

25       this article in connection with the forming of his 3804

1        opinion. I think the question was did he consider

2       this argument -- this article in connection with his

3       opinions. He didn't rely in his opinion -- because

4       his opinions don't agree with those articles.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=640
5            MR. WALKER: Actually, Mr. Uiterwyk objected

6       before I got to those questions with this document.

7       But for all of the other documents, I did ask him

8       whether he took the materials into account in

9       reaching his opinion.

10            MR. UITERWYK: Took the materials into account.

11        That is not relying on the material in connection

12       with the formation of his opinion.

13            MR. WALKER: I think we're splitting hairs,

14       Judge. The witness has said that he's reviewed

15       these materials.

16            THE COURT: Go ahead and -- your objection,

17       generally, is denied. But with respect to whether

18       or not he relied upon it, I think that ought to be

19       the proper question, so you need to ask him that

20       question.

21             MR. WALKER: Sure.

22            (In open court.)

23   BY MR. WALKER:

24       Q.   You had a little extra time to review what I

25   gave you. Have you taken a look at that? 3805

1        A.   Just briefly.

2       Q.   Okay. Certainly, you've seen that article

3   before, right?

4       A.   I've seen the article before.

5       Q.   It's one of the many articles and documents

6   that you reviewed in coming up with your opinions in

7   this case, right?

8       A.   No, I didn't review it. Most of these articles

9   you've showed me, I have not specifically studied in

10   relationship to giving my opinions in this case. I'm

11    familiar with the articles. As a scientist, I have

12   reviewed scientific articles.

13       Q.   Well, this is a scientific article by

14   Dr. Russell, right?

15       A.   That's right.

16       Q.   Are you telling this jury that you didn't take

17   this article by Dr. Russell into account in forming your

18   opinions for this case?

19       A.   I take account of everything that I've

20   reviewed, you know, as a scientist.

21        Q.   But you didn't rely on the article that

22   Dr. Russell wrote?

23       A.   I don't -- you know, specifically for this case

24   to come in as part of my reliance materials, no. I

25   focused on -- most of the information I focused on was 3806

1   the material that I shared with the jury previously.

2       Q.   Well, didn't you say that your testimony is

3   pretty much the same in every case? Didn't you say it's

4   the same story every time you testify?

5       A.   Yeah.

6       Q.   Okay. So are you telling this jury that with

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=641
7   respect to Dr. Russell and what he had to say about

8   filters, you didn't rely on that?

9       A.   I didn't make a specific study to pull this

10   out. I mean, I'm familiar with the article.

11        Q.   I'm asking you if you relied on it. You told

12   us about all the documents you saw, and now you're

13   telling us that this document, perhaps others that I

14   showed you, you didn't rely on in reaching your

15   opinions?

16       A.   I'm not sure what you're -- your use of the

17   term "reliance." It wasn't something that I

18   specifically went to in forming my opinions for this

19   case. I'm familiar with the body of literature that

20   you're talking about. I'm familiar with this article.

21        Q.   What do you think "reliance" means? Don't you

22   think it covers all the documents that you reviewed and

23   took into account in reaching your opinions?

24       A.   Well, you know, everything that I have done, my

25   training, experience, my review of the scientific 3807

1   literature, my writings that I have done, my own

2   research, that's all part of the basis for my opinions.

3       Q.   Are you telling the jury that you only relied

4   on the documents that support your view?

5       A.   I'm telling you that I rely on, you know, what

6   I've just stated. My training, experience, my review of

7   the scientific literature, my review of

8   Surgeon General's reports, my personal research that I

9   have done, the research of others, you know, research of

10   the internal industry documents, all of that is -- forms

11    the basis for my opinion.

12       Q.   Yeah. Did you just rely on documents that

13   support your opinion?

14       A.   No, sir.

15       Q.   Did you rely on documents, including documents

16   that don't support your opinion, like the article from

17   Dr. Russell?

18       A.   I don't know how to answer the question any

19   other different -- differently than I've just stated.

20       Q.   Okay.

21        A.   I rely on everything that I review. I'm

22   familiar with this article.

23       Q.   I showed you a number of things that you didn't

24   show the jury. Did you rely on any of those, or you

25   just didn't take those into account in reaching your 3808

1    opinions?

2       A.   I don't know how to answer that question. I

3   don't know what you didn't show the jury.

4       Q.   No, I'm talking about what you showed the jury.

5            You know what you showed the jury, right?

6       A.   Sure.

7       Q.   Okay. And I've shown you some things you

8   didn't show the jury, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=642
9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   Did you rely on those or did you just rely on

11    the things that you showed the jury that you think

12   support your opinion?

13       A.   I relied on my training, experience, my review

14   of the scientific literature. I bring that into all of

15   what has formed my opinions over the last 33 years of my

16   professional career studying this issue. That's what

17   I've relied on.

18       Q.   But not Dr. Russell, right?

19       A.   I said I'm familiar with the work of

20   Dr. Russell.

21        Q.   I'm not asking you what you're familiar with.

22   I'm asking you what you relied on.

23            You didn't rely on this article of Dr. Russell?

24       A.   Rely on it for what? I'm familiar with the --

25   I've reviewed it. The basis of all my opinions are 3809

1    everything that I have reviewed and studied over the 33

2   years, including the work that I've done with smokers,

3   my own research, material that I've read. And I'm

4   familiar with this article.

5       Q.   Including this article from Dr. Russell?

6       A.   Yeah, I'm familiar with this article.

7       Q.   Well, you just started talking about what you

8   based your opinions and your testimony on.

9       A.   I've read this article.

10       Q.   Okay.

11        A.   That's what I said.

12       Q.   Are your opinions and your testimony in any way

13   based on your review of this article from Dr. Russell?

14       A.   No. I'm familiar with the article. I don't

15   think it's the basis of any opinions. No, it's not.

16       Q.   Was it part of the collection of documents that

17   you've seen that has formed your opinions?

18       A.   Yes. As I described, it's part of the material

19   I reviewed. In my professional career, I'm familiar

20   with Dr. Russell's work and I've read many of his

21    articles, including this one.

22            MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I would ask to display

23       this article from Dr. Russell.

24            THE COURT: You may do so. Go ahead.

25   BY MR. WALKER: 3810

1        Q.   All right. The title of this article is

2   "Realistic Goals for Smoking and Health," right, "A Case

3   for Safer Smoking"?

4       A.   That's the title.

5       Q.   And that's M.A.H. Russell, right?

6       A.   Michael Russell.

7       Q.   Michael Russell.

8            Now, Michael Russell, you can agree with me, he

9   was part of the public health community, right?

10       A.   Sure. I knew Dr. Russell.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=643
11        Q.   All right. He had a section of his article

12   that was entitled "Switch to Filters," right?

13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   On page 256?

15       A.   Where he talks about a variety of things that

16   make smoking safer.

17       Q.   And one of them was "Switch to Filters," right?

18       A.   That was part of the article.

19       Q.   Okay. Let's see what it says. "It is unlikely

20   that any single measure has saved more lives or done

21    more to reduce smoking-related disease than the switch

22   from plain to filter-tipped cigarettes which began in

23   the late 1950s and continued throughout the 1960s."

24            Did I read that correctly?

25       A.   Yes. 3811

1        Q.   This article is from 1974, correct?

2       A.   That's right.

3       Q.   Okay.

4       A.   It's an incorrect conclusion.

5       Q.   Are you telling this jury that Michael Russell

6   was part of a 50-year coverup?

7       A.   No. I'm just saying that in the time when he

8   wrote this article, that particular statement, which I'm

9   sure he felt was true, has turned out -- when you follow

10   the cohorts of smokers over time -- turned out to be

11    untrue.

12       Q.   Was he part of a conspiracy to mislead the

13   American public about filters?

14       A.   No, he's part of the scientific community

15   trying to understand how to reduce the risks associated

16   with smoking.

17       Q.   So he's part of the public health community and

18   the scientific community?

19       A.   He was a scientist, yes.

20       Q.   And what he said at this time in 1974 was that,

21    "It's unlikely that any single measure has saved more

22   lives or done more to reduce smoking-related disease

23   than the switch from plain to filter-tipped cigarettes,"

24   right?

25       A.   And I responded you read it correctly, and I 3812

1   pointed out he got it wrong. When you look at the

2   evidence available now, we follow out the smokers who

3   did the switching, there is no difference, There's no

4   doubt. The ultimate risk went up, not down.

5       Q.   So this is 1974. And then a year later there

6   was a Surgeon General's report, right, 1975?

7       A.   That's true.

8       Q.   You're familiar with that?

9       A.   Yes.

10       Q.   It's part of the body of documentation that you

11    reviewed and analyzed and relied on for your opinions in

12   this case?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=644
13       A.   It's the same answer as I gave before. I've

14   reviewed Surgeon General's reports, as well as other

15   scientific literature, and all of that helps form my

16   opinions.

17            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

18    THE COURT: Yes.

19 BY MR. WALKER:

20       Q.   Actually, I meant to make you the same deal.

21    I've given you the part I'm going to ask you about, but

22   if you want the whole document, you're welcome to it.

23       A.   Sure.

24       Q.   I'll give it to you in a Redwell. Might be

25   easier. 3813

1        A.   Okay. Okay.

2       Q.   So we talked earlier about how the

3   Surgeon General came out with these reports every year,

4   every couple of years, right?

5       A.   Yeah. They were mandated to come out on an

6   annual basis for a period of time.

7       Q.   So this is the one from 1975?

8       A.   Correct, yes.

9       Q.   Okay.

10       A.   Actually, this one is reprinted from 1977.

11             MR. WALKER: Okay. Can we display this?

12            MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

13            THE COURT: All right.

14   BY MR. WALKER:

15       Q.   All right. So there is the cover. And,

16   actually, I want to refer you to numbered page 4.

17       A.   Okay.

18       Q.   About halfway down that paragraph there, you

19   can probably see on your screen, "Smokers of filter

20   cigarettes have been shown to have a lower risk of

21    developing lung cancer than smokers of non-filter

22   cigarettes, but the risk remains well above that for

23   nonsmokers."

24            Did I read that right?

25       A.   You did. 3814

1        Q.   That's the Surgeon General in 1975, right?

2       A.   That's correct.

3       Q.   Okay. Now, you're familiar with the Banbury

4   Conference in 1980?

5       A.   I am.

6       Q.   And there was a report out of the Banbury

7   Conference, right?

8       A.   That's right. The Banbury Report.

9       Q.   The Banbury Report from the Banbury Conference?

10       A.   Correct.

11        Q.   Got it.

12            MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

13    THE COURT: Yes.

14 BY MR. WALKER:

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=645
15       Q.   All right. Now, the Banbury Report, you're

16   obviously familiar with it, because you've just told me

17   that was the name of it, the Banbury Report.

18            It's another one of the documents that was part

19   of the larger collection of documents that you reviewed

20   and on which you base your opinions, right?

21        A.   It's a document I'm familiar with. And like

22   all documents that I've reviewed, you know, they all

23   contribute to my knowledge and the basis for my

24   opinions.

25       Q.   Okay. And by the way, the -- one of the 3815

1    authors or editors, I should say, of the Banbury Report

2   was Fred Bock, right?

3       A.   That's right.

4       Q.   That's the same Fred Bock that we talked about

5   earlier from Roswell Park, right?

6       A.   Right. When Dr. Bock retired, I basically took

7   over the tobacco research program at Roswell from him.

8       Q.   Okay. Now, the report that I've given you is

9   actually the year before you arrived at Roswell, right?

10       A.   That's right.

11        Q.   Okay. And there was a conference at a place

12   called Cold Springs Harbor before this book came out,

13   right?

14       A.   That's right.

15       Q.   And that's where a group of scientists who were

16   interested in smoking and health came together, right?

17       A.   Correct.

18       Q.   Including members of the public health

19   community, right?

20       A.   Yes.

21        Q.   Like Dr. Hammond, right?

22       A.   Correct.

23       Q.   That's the same doctor that the jury saw from

24   the See It Now clip earlier?

25       A.   That's right. 3816

1        Q.   And Dr. Wynder was also there, right?

2       A.   That's right.

3       Q.   Okay. There was Dr. Lawrence Garfinkel, head

4   of statistics at the American Cancer Society. He was

5   there too, right?

6       A.   Yes, sir.

7       Q.   He's the person who took over at the American

8   Cancer Society for Dr. Hammond?

9       A.   Yes, Garfinkel and now Mike Thun.

10       Q.   And let's see. Dr. Michael Russell, we just

11    saw his article. He was there at the Banbury Conference

12   too, right?

13       A.   That's right.

14       Q.   Okay. And so then after the conference, they

15   took all the papers that were presented at the

16   conference and they put them all together in a book,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=646
17   right?

18       A.   Yeah, a monograph.

19       Q.   A monograph. Okay.

20            And that's what this Banbury Report is, right?

21        A.   Yes, sir.

22       Q.   Publicly available?

23       A.   Yes.

24       Q.   You can check it out in some libraries, right?

25       A.   A few libraries have it. 3817

1        Q.   You have your own copy though, right?

2       A.   I do.

3       Q.   And you're familiar with Dr. Hammond's paper in

4   the Banbury Report, right?

5       A.   Sure.

6       Q.   And as we mentioned, Dr. Hammond was with the

7   American Cancer Society, correct?

8       A.   Correct.

9            MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I would like to

10       display the Banbury Report co-edited by Fred Bock

11        from 1980.

12            MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

13            THE COURT: All right.

14            THE WITNESS: Which of the articles are you

15       referring to, because he has a couple that he

16       co-authored?

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q.   I'll give you a page reference in just a

19   moment.

20       A.   Okay.

21        Q.   So this is the -- the early part of the book,

22   right, the title, the editor, Gio Gori of the National

23   Cancer Institute, right?

24       A.   That's right.

25       Q.   Worked on this with Fred Bock? 3818

1        A.   Correct.

2       Q.   Okay. And there then are some pictures on the

3   left of some of the other people who participated,

4   right?

5       A.   That's right.

6       Q.   So let's turn to -- let's see. I think it's

7   page 13. Actually, let's start at the top. You had

8   asked me which article. At the top. There we go.

9            So this article is "The Long-Term Benefits of

10   Reducing Tar and Nicotine in Cigarettes,"

11    E. Cuyler Hammond, American Cancer Society, New York.

12            You see that?

13       A.   Yes.

14       Q.   So you know which article I'm talking about

15   now, right?

16       A.   I do.

17       Q.   Okay. Let's see what Dr. Hammond wrote in

18    1980. Right at the beginning.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=647
19             "Sometime in the early 1960s, the first

20   committee meeting ever on the subject of the

21    less-harmful effects of low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes

22   was convened in Washington. At this meeting,

23   Ernst Wynder and I drafted a resolution that was

24   approved by the committee and was quoted in the

25   Congressional record and by the Surgeon General. 3819

1             "It said, The preponderance of scientific

2   evidence strongly suggests that the lower the tar and

3   nicotine content in cigarettes, the less harmful would

4   be the effects (U.S. Congress 1967).'"

5            Then it goes on to say, "This statement has

6   been relevant ever since. Today, I would change this

7   wording. Instead of saying that, quote, the

8   preponderance of scientific evidence strongly suggests,

9   I'd now say, quote, the preponderance of scientific

10   evidence very strongly suggests, and I'd leave the rest

11    of the wording unchanged."

12            Did I read that right?

13       A.   You did read that right.

14       Q.   That's Dr. Hammond in 1980, right?

15       A.   Correct.

16       Q.   Not part of a coverup, was he?

17       A.   No. He was a scientist.

18       Q.   Not a co-conspirator in a --

19       A.   No. If you get low tar, you actually get less

20   tar. It's safer.

21        Q.   All right. If we go on in Dr. Hammond's paper,

22   he discusses the study he was doing on low-tar and

23   low-nicotine cigarettes, right?

24       A.   That's right.

25       Q.   Let's go to page 14. Start at 14 and then 3820

1   we'll read over to 15. Okay?

2       A.   Okay.

3       Q.   "Dr. Hammond's findings: Males smoking

4   low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes showed 17 percent to 21

5   percent lower lung cancer mortality than those smoking

6   high-tar, high-nicotine cigarettes. In women, the

7   mortality ratio was 38 percent to 43 percent lower in

8   the low category compared to those smoking high-tar,

9   high-nicotine cigarettes."

10            Did I read that correctly?

11        A.   You read that correctly.

12       Q.   All right. Those were among Dr. Hammond's

13   findings in 1980, right?

14       A.   That's right.

15       Q.   And then Dr. Hammond had a summary on page 18.

16   You see that?

17       A.   Yes.

18       Q.   "Summary:  Smokers now in their 30s and 40s

19   shorten their life expectancy considerably if they

20   continue to smoke. If they must smoke, they would be

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=648
21    well advised to switch to a low-tar, low-nicotine

22   cigarette."

23            Did I read that correctly?

24       A.   You did.

25       Q.   All right. The next year, there was another 3821

1    Surgeon General's report in 1981, right?

2       A.   That's right.

3       Q.   This one was focused on cigarette design,

4   right?

5       A.   "The Changing Cigarette," yes.

6       Q.   "The Changing Cigarette."

7            If I recall correctly, you want the whole

8   thing, right?

9       A.   Sure.

10       Q.   All right. This Surgeon General's report, like

11    the other Surgeon General's report, is just one of the

12   many documents that you reviewed on which you base your

13   testimony and your opinions, right?

14       A.   I'm familiar with Surgeon General's reports and

15   have reviewed them. And everything that I've reviewed

16   in my professional career has helped form my opinions.

17            MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I'd like to

18       display the 1981 Surgeon General's report.

19            THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk?

20            MR. UITERWYK: I have no objection, Your Honor.

21             THE COURT: All right.

22   BY MR. WALKER:

23       Q.   And sure enough, just as you said, this one is

24   entitled "The Changing Cigarette," right?

25       A.   That's right. 3822

1        Q.   Okay. Let's take a look at page 18 of the

2   report.

3            All right. Right there it says, "Cancer.

4   Today's filter-tipped, lower tar and nicotine cigarettes

5   produce lower rates of lung cancer than do their higher

6   tar and nicotine predecessors. Nonetheless, smokers of

7   lower tar and nicotine cigarettes have much higher lung

8   cancer incidence and mortality than do nonsmokers."

9            Did I read that correctly?

10       A.   You did.

11             MR. UITERWYK: Can we go to the next paragraph,

12       please? Rule of completeness, Your Honor, second

13       paragraph.

14            MR. WALKER: Judge, I don't think it's -

15            THE COURT: I need to see the document then

16       before I can rule on it.

17            (At the bench.)

18            THE COURT: All right. I'm going to ask that

19       you publish it.

20            MR. WALKER: Sure thing, Judge.

21             THE COURT: And after that, we can take our

22       break.

23            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

24            (In open court.)

25   BY MR. WALKER: 3823

1        Q.   Okay. I'm going to read these -- the complete.

2   Okay?

3       A.   Okay.

4       Q.   You tell me if I get it wrong.

5             "Today's filter-tipped, lower tar and nicotine

6   cigarettes produce lower rates of lung cancer than do

7   their higher tar and nicotine predecessors.

8   Nonetheless, smokers of lower tar and nicotine

9   cigarettes have much higher lung cancer incidence and

10   mortality than do nonsmokers.

11             "Smokers of lower tar and nicotine cigarettes

12   may tend to smoke larger numbers of cigarettes, to

13   inhale more deeply, to have relatively higher amounts of

14   carboxyhemoglobin than predicted from machine

15   measurements of carbon monoxide yield and to have higher

16   than predicted carbon monoxide in exhaled air."

17            Did I read that correctly?

18       A.   No. Carboxyhemoglobin is the, you know,

19   talking about the amount of carbon monoxide that someone

20   would inhale from the burning byproduct.

21        Q.   Let me try again. Carboxyhemoglobin?

22       A.   Yes.

23       Q.   I'll get it right next time.

24       A.   Sure.

25            And they got the statement wrong because --3824

1            THE COURT: Well, the question was, did Mr. --

2            THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.

3            THE COURT: The question was, did Mr. Walker

4       read it correctly, other than "carboxyhemoglobin"?

5            THE WITNESS: You got it right. He got it

6       wrong.

7            THE COURT: Well, third time's a charm.

8            MR. WALKER: But who's counting.

9            All right. Judge, this is a good place to

10       stop.

11             THE COURT: Okay. We're going to break for

12       lunch.

13            Bear in mind my instructions to keep an open

14       mind. Do not discuss this case amongst yourself or

15       with anyone. We'll be in recess until 1:30. Thank

16       you.

17            (The jury excused from the courtroom at

18    12:14 p.m.)

19            THE COURT: Mr. Walker and Mr. Pedrosa, would

20       you counsel with plaintiffs counsel about how much

21        longer you expect to be on cross so they can have

22       some idea of how to line up their witnesses if we

23       get to any additional witnesses today. Okay?

24            MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=650
25           THE COURT: Thank you.

3825

1            MR. PEDROSA: Just before we go, Your Honor --

2            MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, one thing. We

3       learned something that --

4            MR. BIGGER: That would be helpful to have that

5       if they have an idea now. I know it was

6       midafternoon break at the latest yesterday. I just

7       don't know where we're at right now with Mr. Walker.

8            MR. WALKER: My guess would be, I have

9       somewhere between two and a half to three hours

10       more.

11             THE COURT: And, Mr. Pedrosa, you still think

12       you might have an hour?

13            MR. PEDROSA: Yes, sir.

14            THE COURT: That would probably consume the

15       rest of the day.

16            MR. BIGGER: Yeah. I just don't want to raise

17       the issue before --1 received a frantic e-mail from

18       plaintiffs counsel in the Fort Myers case. I'm

19       sure Mr. Walker's aware of this or someone on his

20       team is as well.

21             The judge down there has indicated that if

22       Dr. Cummings is not available to testify first thing

23       tomorrow morning, he's going to force the

24       plaintiffs counsel to rest their case and not

25       permit Dr. --3826

1            THE COURT: I've never heard that rule before.

2            MR. BIGGER: Yeah. In any event, that's the

3       e-mail I received.

4            My suggestion would be, obviously --1

5       understand Your Honor doesn't want to call the

6       judge, and I certainly respect that.

7            Perhaps what we need to consider then is, you

8       know, staying, keeping Dr. Cummings here to finish

9       today and asking the jurors if they, you know, can,

10       obviously, stay late. Letting them know now so they

11        can make arrangements and stay late this evening, an

12       hour or whatever it might be.

13            I know we don't have an extremely lengthy

14       redirect, but, obviously, there's some things we

15       need to cover so that we can finish this up and make

16       sure that Dr. Cummings is able to get to Fort Myers

17       this evening. Although, you know, I was promised --

18       much later than promised due to the way things have

19       gone.

20            THE COURT: All right. First, you may be

21        seated.

22            MR. WALKER: Thank you for that, Your Honor.

23            THE COURT: Yeah.

24            Defense counsel have any objection to

25       plaintiffs request of staying later to finish 3827

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=651
1        Dr. Cummings today?

2            MR. WALKER: I don't think it's fair to this

3       jury, but I'm prepared to defer to Your Honor on

4       that.

5            THE COURT: Okay. Well, I --

6            MR. BIGGER: The other option, Judge, is, I

7       mean, frankly, if they're finished with their cross

8       this evening, we're fine deferring our redirect, if

9       that's what it would take, and having to come back

10       and do redirect, you know, a day or two later and

11        have Dr. Cummings back and do redirect.

12            I mean, they obviously objected for the cross,

13       but if they don't -- if they have an objection to us

14       staying late, that's the other remedy.

15            MR. WALKER: I object to there being a break in

16       Dr. Cummings' testimony. I do object to that.

17            THE COURT: Yeah.

18            MR. WALKER: With respect to whether you keep

19       the jury late to accommodate some other plaintiff, I

20       defer to Your Honor on that. I don't think it's

21        fair to this jury, but I defer to Your Honor's

22       decision on that.

23            MR. UITERWYK: As Your Honor knows, the -- they

24       have gone over --

25            MR. TRENTALANGE: I want to make clear, does he 3828

1        have any option but to defer to the Court?

2            THE COURT: Well, of course. I mean, people

3       say that all the time. I understand that.

4            MR. UITERWYK: And the problem is, Your Honor,

5       is that Mr. Bigger mentioned about the fact that we

6       don't know how long redirect is going to take. And

7       I honestly don't know how long redirect is going to

8       take because, as we -- as you know, we've gone over

9       literally almost dozens of documents, dozens of

10       articles that he was simply asked basically to read

11        and consider this --

12            THE COURT: Wait just a minute.

13            Dr. Cummings, you need to wait outside, please.

14            THE WITNESS: Sure.

15            MR. BIGGER: Can he go to lunch, Judge?

16            THE COURT: Pardon me?

17            MR. BIGGER: Can he go to lunch?

18            THE COURT: Yes.

19             1:30, Dr. Cummings.

20            (Dr. Cummings exited courtroom at 12:18 p.m.)

21             MR. UITERWYK: And it's obviously clear that

22       he's going to have some comments with regard to

23       either how, when this article was done, they didn't

24       have all the information or the information wasn't

25       provided by the cigarette companies or the cigarette 3829

1        companies knew more than was provided in here. And

2       it's going to be on different issues as it relates

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=652
3       to many of the articles.

4            And my problem is, in order to do that -- you

5       know, I could try to rush, but I'm -- there's going

6       to be -- not going to come out very well, number

7       one.

8            And number two, the problem is, as time gets

9       later this evening, there's an absorption threshold

10       by the jury going through literally dozens of

11        documents over a period of hours, eight hours or 10

12       hours or 12 hours in the day, and it's not fair to

13       the plaintiff to then have these jurors sit here

14       until late this evening going over redirect in order

15       to clarify a lot of the information.

16            THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk, I had no part to play

17       in scheduling another trial in Fort Myers after this

18       case was scheduled. That --1 had -- there was no

19       control by me over that. There's no control --1

20       had no part to play with Dr. Cummings agreeing to

21        testify in this case and in the case in Fort Myers.

22            And I'm -- I'm willing to accommodate your

23       request to stay later, although, I think reasonably

24       that would be -- we're not going to get into a

25       situation of getting dinner again and that sort of 3830

1        thing. That's too complicated and -- but, you know,

2       I think -- 6:30-ish, in that range, you know.

3            If it goes a little bit later, I'm not putting

4       down a bright line, but in that neighborhood so

5       people can get home, have dinner, do -- relax and

6       meet with their family members or friends or

7       whatever, so they can have -- but beyond that,

8       it's -- it gets to be problematic in terms of

9       keeping them here without notice, plus keeping them

10       beyond the dinner hour.

11             And, certainly, the only notice they're going

12       to have now is -- if they need to change their

13       plans -- would be a -- at the midafternoon break,

14       all to accommodate some other parties in some case.

15            Which I understand that. It's not as if --1

16       understand that. And I think professionally we

17       should try and do that to the extent that we can. I

18       think there should be a professional courtesy shown

19       to witnesses and other lawyers, whether plaintiffs

20       or defense lawyers, to all lawyers in general, to

21        try to accommodate their schedule. There's nothing

22       wrong with that. It should be condoned, but to what

23       extent. You know, we're in the whatever, third,

24       fourth, fifth day of his testimony, and we've got to

25       complete his testimony here. And I --1 don't have 3831

1        any --1 don't --1 think those are our only

2       options.

3            If you want to go later today, we can go later,

4       based upon the timeframes I've given you. Or if you

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=653
5       would prefer to continue to tomorrow when the jury

6       may be fresher and you may be fresher, that's --

7       that's your call. But I'm not making your call.

8       You're making your call.

9            MR. UITERWYK: My problem is, Your Honor, we

10       have -- he was scheduled to be a couple of days ago,

11        actually, in Fort Myers. And what happened was, we

12       all know, our jury selection got pushed back and we

13       finished late Thursday night. And then we did

14       the --1 believe on Friday we did the openings. And

15       then Monday we had a holiday. So -- and Tuesday we

16       had some other witnesses.

17            Dr. Cummings was scheduled to come in Tuesday

18       to testify Tuesday. He didn't because of the way

19       the arrangements were set up at that time. And we

20       didn't want to put him on and then take him off,

21       because he was going to be testifying in Fort Myers.

22            And what happened is, they pushed his testimony

23       in Fort Myers back three days, from what I

24       understand.

25            Right, Brent? 3832

1            MR. BIGGER: Yes.

2            MR. UITERWYK: And he -- now, if we don't

3       finish him tonight and/or bring him back a day from

4       now, a day after, day after tomorrow to finish his

5       testimony --

6            THE COURT: I'm not going to do that.

7            MR. UITERWYK: -- they're going -- they're

8       going to get a directed verdict or a mistrial.

9            THE COURT: You know, I have enough -- I'm

10       not -- I'm not being flip about this, but I have

11        enough to say grace over in this case. This is very

12       complicated, has legal issues that I don't -- I'm

13       not speaking for anybody else -- that I don't

14       encounter typically. There has already been one

15       request, as I recall, for mistrial, which I've

16       denied. And, you know, I need -- my focus is this

17       case.

18            Professionally, as a judge and as a lawyer, I

19       would like to extend every courtesy to counsel in

20       any other case in terms of scheduling, but we have a

21        unique situation here that we have to finish his

22       testimony one way or another. And there have been a

23       lot of documents that you introduced through

24       Dr. Cummings. I think 150.

25            MR. UITERWYK: No. 3833

1            THE COURT: Those that are in your books.

2            MR. UITERWYK: A lot of demonstratives in

3       there, Judge.

4            THE COURT: Okay. Agreed. But--1 don't know

5       how many. There were many. And counsel is asking

6       about some other documents that he considered.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=654
7            So I -- you know, you can think about what

8       you'd like to do, but the only two options that I

9       see -- I'm sorry for what result may -- may fall

10       upon counsel in another case, but my concern is this

11        case, and I -- we can continue today or tomorrow,

12       but you need to let me know when you come back from

13       lunch.

14            MR. UITERWYK: The problem is, Judge, let's

15       assume we continue today and we're not going to go

16       beyond 6:30 --

17            THE COURT: More or less.

18            MR. UITERWYK: --what do we do then?

19            THE COURT: If you're not finished, then you

20       can -- you can either say, "No more questions," or

21        we'll call him back tomorrow.

22            MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, may I be heard on

23       this?

24            THE COURT: Yes.

25            MR. PEDROSA: I'm willing to do the same things 3834

1        that Your Honor has discussed in terms of trying to

2       extend professional courtesies to lawyers in other

3       cases. And if that means we stay until 6:30 today

4       to finish with Dr. Cummings so that he can leave

5       town tonight and appear in some other case, that's

6       one thing. Depending on what time I'm tendered the

7       witness, what I would object to is getting him, say,

8       at 5:00 or 5:30, having to do my cross at the end of

9       the day when the jury wants to go home, and then

10       bringing him back anyway the next day.

11             THE COURT: No, we're going to make the

12       decision -- I'm not going to -- we're going to make

13       the decision at -- when he comes back. I mean,

14       after lunch, which I would like to get.

15            MR. UITERWYK: I'm kind of in a catch-22,

16       really, Judge. I am between a rock and a hard

17       place. I'm darned if I do and I'm darned if I

18       don't. And, you know, I've got to think, obviously,

19       about this case, but I also know that Dr. Cummings

20       feels -- you know, he feels a tremendous amount of

21       pressure because of the situation that's going on

22       down in Fort Myers where somebody may --

23            THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk, I didn't make his

24       schedule, you didn't make his schedule. I'm only

25       responsible for myself. I can't control other 3835

1       people, what they're doing, and I -- my -- and the

2       same would apply to you and everybody here. You

3       didn't make the schedule of plaintiffs counsel in

4       that other case.

5            MR. UITERWYK: No, Your Honor. I've had -- and

6       I'm sure the Court has had as well -- have had

7       situations where things like that arise.

8            THE COURT: I have had both as lawyer and a

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=655
9       judge. I'm very sympathetic to it, but I don't know

10       what else to do. I'm trying to extend the courtesy,

11       but we've got a legal obligation to make sure that

12       this case is tried completely and fully, and we need

13       to finish with this witness.

14            MR. UITERWYK: Could you call the judge?

15            THE COURT: No, I'm not going to call the

16       judge. What would I do calling the judge? To ask

17       him to do what? To not meddle into his affairs, to

18       not grant a mistrial in another case? That's not

19       my -- that's not my call. I can't do that. I can't

20       tell what another judge should do in his case.

21             MR. BIGGER: We appreciate what Your Honor is

22       saying. I'll advise plaintiffs counsel that, you

23       know, we're going to decide to either stay late or

24       figure out what we're going to do here. I'll tell

25       Your Honor, it's likely we're going to decide to 3836

1        stay late, but we'll let you know when we get back

2       from lunch.

3            I appreciate counsel's statement as to how much

4       time they have left. I know that's preliminary.

5       They may, perhaps, look at their notes and see if

6       that's still accurate. But, obviously, I'm hoping

7       certainly -- now that Your Honor has said how late

8       we're going to stay, if it goes up, I'm going to be

9       substantially concerned with that decision. I think

10       in light of what Your Honor has said, the idea

11        should be to look at our cross, look at our

12       redirect, and everyone make every effort to get out

13       of here.

14            THE COURT: I think before plaintiffs counsel

15       makes a decision on whether to stay late tonight or

16       to go tomorrow, defense counsel need to reevaluate

17       their position, look at their notes, confer --

18       Mr. Pedrosa, confer with Mr. Walker and give us your

19       best estimate, and then you can make a decision

20       based on that.

21             But that's -- I'm sorry. I wish the situation

22       were not what it is, but it is what it is, and those

23       are the only two options that I see that we have.

24       And I would like to extend every professional

25       courtesy, but I have legal obligations which take 3837

1       precedence over that.

2            So we'll be in recess until 1:30.

3            (Lunch recess taken at 12:30 p.m.)

1                      PROCEEDINGS

2              (Court called to order at 1:32 p.m.)

3              THE BAILIFF: All rise. Come to order.

4         Court's back in session.

5              THE COURT: Thank you. Be seated.

6              I would like somebody to provide me with the

7         instruction that I gave to the panel regarding the

8         Engle findings as given.

9              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I think Brent has

10         the instruction, but I might be able to find the

11          transcript.

12              THE COURT: I need to see the transcript.

13         There was -- in looking through my notes, I just

14         want to make sure I gave it all. There was a

15         sheet of paper -- the instruction that the lawyers

16         gave me was two pages. And I was rereading it,

17         and when I reread it, there was a page in between

18         the two pages. And I just -- because I've looked

19         at so much, I just want to make sure that I read

20         all of two pages and didn't stop after the first

21         page.

22              MR. UITERWYK: I think you did read it,

23         Judge.

24              THE COURT: Okay. I want to satisfy my own

25         curiosity. I would assume that if I didn't read 3843

1         the whole one, that the lawyers would have caught

2         it, but rule number one is assume nothing.

3              MR. SEIDEN: Your Honor, do you want me to

4         find it and bring it to you at the next break?

5              THE COURT: Yes.

6              All right. Have counsel been able to confer?

7              MR. WALKER: I spoke with Mr. Uiterwyk just

8         moments before Your Honor came in and advised him

9         that in reviewing my notes, I still think I have

10         probably about three hours, possibly a little bit

11          more, but I'm going to try to keep it to three

12         hours.

13              THE COURT: Mr. Pedrosa, you still think

14         you'll be an hour?

15              MR. PEDROSA: I'm still at an hour, Judge,

16         yes.

17              THE COURT: Okay. What do you want to do,

18         Mr. Uiterwyk?

19              MR. UITERWYK: I don't think -- let me tell

20         you what the problem is. This occurred once

21         before, by the way, Judge, with Dr. Cummings

22         actually in a federal court case in Tallahassee

23         where the same exact -- almost the exact same

24         situation. I was told this by Dr. Cummings. He's

25         committed to be in a federal court case tomorrow 3844

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=660
1         morning. And he's going to go there tomorrow

2         morning. And I've been told that by him. And

3         there's not much I can do, Judge. I mean, if

4         they're going to take until six o'clock -- I've

5         cut, I hope, my redirect to an hour.

6              THE COURT: Well, if you want him to be here,

7         I'll issue an instanter subpoena for him to stay

8         here.

9              Are you under subpoena in federal court?

10              THE WITNESS: No, sir.

11               THE COURT: Okay.

12              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, he's got --1

13         can't do that to Dr. Cummings.

14              THE COURT: Okay. Well, then I can't -- you

15         know, if -- I've done all that I can do. So if

16         you have no -- if we run until six o'clock and you

17         don't want him to come back tomorrow, we're not

18         going to go beyond 6:30.

19              MR. UITERWYK: And you won't allow me to

20         bring him back the next day?

21               THE COURT: No. Because then--first of

22         all -- for lots of reasons. But the primary

23         reason is -- well, the two primary reasons, we may

24         be in the defense case when he's brought back, and

25         it just muddies the water in terms of motions for 3845

1          directed verdict.

2              In addition --

3              MR. UITERWYK: I would not bring him back if

4         we were in the defense case, Your Honor.

5              THE COURT: Pardon me?

6              MR. UITERWYK: I would not bring him back if

7         we were in the defense case.

8              THE COURT: Well, okay. We don't know that.

9         Just as if he didn't know -- I'm referring to he,

10         even though you're here -- there was no way to

11         predict reasonably, from what I've heard, that

12         Dr. Cummings would not be able to meet his federal

13         court obligations. But the fact of the matter is

14         we're in that squeeze. I don't want to be put in

15         the situation the reverse of what the -- the exact

16         same situation that the federal district judge is.

17         He's here. I'm going to keep him here until he

18         finishes if you want me to. If not, then that's

19         your choice. But I'm not going to be in a

20         situation where we have to -- where he's in

21          federal court for three days and you've rested and

22         the defense is putting on their case and we have a

23         whole set of circumstances that we're not dealing

24         with now.

25              So the case is complicated enough. I'm not 3846

1          going to create a situation that makes it more

2         complicated. So I'll tell the jury we may be as

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=661
3         late as 6:30 today, approximately, and they'll

4         make arrangements for that. And if you want him

5         here tomorrow, I will issue an instanter subpoena

6         for him, directing him to appear. If you don't

7         want that, that's your choice.

8              MR. TRENTALANGE: Can we defer, Your Honor,

9         on that decision?

10              THE COURT: Yes.

11               All right. Bring the jury in, please.

12              THE BAILIFF: All rise.

13              (Jury in at 1:37 p.m.)

14              THE COURT: Thank you. Be seated.

15              We're ready to continue, Mr. Walker. You may

16         proceed.

17              MR. WALKER: Thank you, Judge.

18              Good afternoon.

19                  CONTINUED CROSS-EXAMINATION

20     BY MR. WALKER:

21          Q.   Good afternoon, Dr. Cummings.

22         A.   Good afternoon.

23         Q.   We had been talking about and looking through

24     some of the statements from people in the scientific

25     community, the public health community on the subject 3847

1      of filters.

2         A.   That's right.

3         Q.   And next I want to ask you about the 1982

4     Surgeon General's report.

5              MR. WALKER: May I approach the witness,

6         Judge?

7              THE COURT: Yes.

8     BY MR. WALKER:

9         Q.   Do you want the whole thing?

10         A.   Sure.

11          Q.   Okay. I forgot.

12              Now, the 1982 Surgeon General's report, like

13     all the other Surgeon General's reports, are part of

14     the scientific literature that you reviewed in reaching

15     your opinions, correct?

16         A.   I've reviewed it, yes.

17         Q.   Okay. I want to turn your attention to

18     page 145 of that report.

19         A.   Sure.

20              MR. WALKER: And I would ask to display the

21          report.

22              THE COURT: Any objection?

23              MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

24              THE COURT: All right.

25              THE WITNESS: Okay. 3848

1              MR. WALKER: All right. Let's see the first

2         page first, if you would, please.

3     BY MR. WALKER:

4         Q.   Okay. The health consequences of smoking.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=662
5     This one is simply entitled "Cancer," right?

6         A.   Right.

7         Q.   Okay. A report of the Surgeon General.

8              MR. WALKER: Now, if we could go to page 145.

9         Zoom in on the fifth item under "summary."

10     BY MR. WALKER:

11          Q.   "Filtered lower tar cigarette smokers have a

12     lower lung cancer risk compared to nonfiltered, higher

13     tar cigarette smokers. However, the risk for these

14     smokers is still substantially elevated above the risk

15     of nonsmokers."

16              Did I read that right?

17         A.   You did.

18         Q.   Okay. And if we were to move forward --

19              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, if we could look

20         also for sake of completeness at paragraph 2 -- 1

21          and 2, please.

22              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I would ask that you

23         review those. I don't think they're --1 don't

24         think they fit under the rule.

25              THE COURT: Okay. Can I see the --3849

1              MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

2              THE COURT: Is it numeral 2, Mr. Uiterwyk?

3              MR. UITERWYK: Number 1 and 2, Your Honor.

4              THE COURT: Let me take a look at it.

5              (At sidebar.)

6              THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk, I don't think 1 and

7         2 relate to filtered cigarettes.

8              MR. UITERWYK: They do. Because one of the

9         things he's going to be testifying to is that

10         fact. And you will see that the 2004 Surgeon

11          General report come out and basically said that

12         filtered cigarettes don't do squat. And what they

13         found out, Judge, after we talked to them --

14         anyway, it doesn't matter how they found out --

15         what they'll say is their inhalation patterns, the

16         deepness of the inhalation, the compensation done

17         by cigarette smokers, which is exactly what's

18         being referred to in paragraph 2, affects the

19         cancer rates. And that's why this needs to be

20         brought up now. And I think it's appropriate to

21          have them do.

22              THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead and read it.

23              MR. WALKER: Sure, Your Honor.

24              (Sidebar concluded.)

25     BY MR. WALKER: 3850

1          Q.   All right. Let's read 1 and 2.

2              "Cigarette smoking is the major cause of lung

3     cancer in the United States. Lung cancer mortality

4     increases with increasing dosage of smoke exposure as

5     measured by the number of cigarettes smoked daily, the

6     duration of smoking, and inhalation patterns, and is

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=663
7     inversely related to the age of initiation. Smokers

8     who consume two or more packs of cigarettes daily have

9     lung cancer mortality rates 15 to 25 times greater than

10     nonsmokers."

11               All right. Now, in 1990, the Surgeon General

12     came out with another Surgeon General's report, right?

13         A.   Yes, on the benefits of smoking cessation.

14              MR. WALKER: May I approach, sir?

15              THE COURT: Yes, sir.

16     BY MR. WALKER:

17         Q.   I'll give you the whole thing.

18              And what I've just handed you is the Surgeon

19     General's report you were remembering, The Health

20     Benefits of Smoking Cessation?

21          A.   Correct.

22         Q.   A report of the Surgeon General 1990, right?

23         A.   Right.

24         Q.   Like the other Surgeon General reports, this

25     was a part of the scientific literature that has 3851

1     informed your opinions in this case, right?

2         A.   Yes, sir.

3         Q.   Okay.

4              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I would like to

5         display the 1990 Surgeon General's report.

6              MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

7              THE COURT: All right.

8     BY MR. WALKER:

9         Q.   And there it is. Health benefits of smoking

10     cessation. A report of the Surgeon General 1990. And

11      if we could, please, look at page 124.

12              Excuse me. "Differences in the reduction in

13     risk following cessation also have been investigated by

14     types of cigarettes smoked. A lower risk of lung

15     cancer has been observed for smokers of filter

16     cigarettes compared with smokers of nonfilter

17     cigarettes."

18              And then there's a cite to "U.S. DHHS 1982,

19      1989, Wynder and Kabat, 1988, a pattern suggesting that

20     the reduction in risk among former smokers may be more

21      apparent for filter cigarette smokers."

22              MR. UITERWYK: Could you read the rest of the

23         next sentence starting with "however," Your Honor?

24     BY MR. WALKER:

25         Q.   First of all, did I read that part right? 3852

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   Okay.

3              MR. UITERWYK: For rule of completeness, Your

4         Honor.

5     BY MR. WALKER:

6         Q.   Sure. However, among former smokers -- I'm

7     sorry. "However, no significant differences in the

8     trend of risk reduction by years of smoking abstinence,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=664
9     (zero, one to four, five to nine, and greater than or

10     equal to ten) and by type of cigarette smoked (filter,

11      mixed, nonfilter) were observed by Lubin and coworkers

12     (1984b) in the European case-control study."

13              Did I read that correctly?

14         A.   You did.

15         Q.   Now, you talked a lot about some general

16     design features of cigarettes during your direct

17     examination, right?

18         A.   Yes.

19         Q.   I want to actually ask you about the Winston

20     cigarettes that Mrs. Loyd smoked, okay?

21          A.   Okay.

22         Q.   You talked about vent holes when you were

23     talking about cigarettes, generally, right?

24         A.   That's right.

25         Q.   But you don't know when Winston cigarettes 3853

1     first had vent holes, do you?

2         A.   No.

3         Q.   You talked about burn rates in your direct

4     examination, right?

5         A.   That's right.

6         Q.   But you don't know what the burn rate was of

7     a Winston cigarette, say, in the 1950s, do you?

8         A.   No.

9         Q.   Or the 1960s?

10         A.   No.

11          Q.   At any point in time?

12         A.   Incorrect. I do know the burn rate currently

13     because it's part of the research that I do.

14         Q.   Burn rate for today?

15         A.   Yes. Because of the banded paper that's used

16     on the substance.

17         Q.   Do you know the burn rate for Winston

18     cigarettes from 1954 to 1993?

19         A.   No.

20         Q.   Okay. You don't know when reconstituted

21      tobacco was first introduced and used in Winston

22     cigarettes, do you?

23         A.   It was used right from the beginning.

24         Q.   Are you saying that you know when

25     reconstituted tobacco was first introduced? 3854

1         A.   Yes, sir.

2         Q.   When did you find that out?

3         A.   Part of the research that I had done. I

4     don't know the date that I found it out.

5         Q.   Okay. Do you remember testifying that you

6     didn't know the first day it was used?

7         A.   I may have earlier, but I've come across

8     documents that talk about the use of reconstituted

9     tobacco back in the '50s, for Winston.

10         Q.   Okay. So you have testified previously that

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=665
11      you don't know when it was first used but today you

12     don't?

13         A.   I don't dispute that. I've been testifying

14     since 1996.

15         Q.   Would it surprise you if you testified last

16     year that you didn't know?

17         A.   No. It would be a formulation document I

18     found in the last nine months.

19         Q.   You talked about particle size. Do you

20     remember that?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   Do you know the particle size of Winston

23     between 1954 and 1994?

24         A.   No. Not precisely.

25         Q.   You talked about levulinic acid, right? 3855

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   But you don't know when levulinic acid was

3     used in Winston cigarettes, do you?

4         A.   No.

5         Q.   Now, you testified and I tried to make a note

6     of this, that cigarettes have been blended for mildness

7     so to make it easier to inhale the smoke into your

8     lungs. Is that -- that was part of your testimony?

9         A.   Yes, it was.

10         Q.   Okay. And you talked about flue-cured

11      tobacco. That was one of the blends?

12         A.   That's right.

13         Q.   And burley tobacco?

14         A.   Early Turkish.

15         Q.   And you talked about pH levels, right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   And you talked about pH levels in connection

18     with smokers' ability to inhale cigarette smoke, right?

19         A.   That's right.

20         Q.   Okay. And you would agree that cigars,

21      another type of tobacco product, are not easy to

22     inhale, right?

23         A.   Yes.

24         Q.   But can you agree with me that conventional

25     cigarettes are designed to be inhaled? 3856

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   Okay. And that people who smoke conventional

3     cigarettes expect cigarettes to be inhalable, right?

4         A.   I don't know what that expectation is. I've

5     not seen research on it.

6         Q.   Okay. You've studied smokers' perceptions

7     and consumer perception, you talked about all that on

8     direct. But you haven't actually studied whether a

9     smoker who goes to a store to buy a pack of cigarettes

10     expects to be able to inhale the smoke from the

11      cigarettes?

12         A.   No, I haven't asked that expectation. I've

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=666
13     studied inhalation of smokers but I haven't asked about

14     their perception of what they expect from it.

15         Q.   You've worked in this area. I know you're

16     telling me you haven't seen a study. Is there any

17     doubt in your mind that smokers of conventional

18     cigarettes, normal cigarettes that you can buy in the

19     store, is there any doubt in your mind that smokers

20     expect the cigarettes they buy to be inhalable?

21          A.   Well, I know that some smokers inhale, most

22     do. But there are some that don't. I'm not sure about

23     the expectation. I haven't studied it.

24         Q.   Okay. Just not sure about that?

25         A.   No. 3857

1          Q.   Okay. Let's see. By the way, when you

2     talked about filters, you also said that -- or did you

3     say that filters make it easier for people to inhale

4     cigarettes?

5         A.   Yes, sir.

6         Q.   Okay. And when you were talking about

7     flavorants and additives, you were saying that those

8     were things that make cigarettes taste good? That's

9     one of the things they do, right?

10         A.   Sure.

11          Q.   Okay.

12         A.   It's one of the things.

13         Q.   Okay. Have you researched whether smokers

14     when they go to the store to buy cigarettes expect that

15     the cigarettes they're buying will taste good?

16         A.   Sure.

17         Q.   Okay. And that's something that's one of the

18     expectations that people have about the cigarettes they

19     buy, isn't it?

20         A.   That's right.

21          Q.   Now, let's be clear. If you had it your way,

22     the sale of cigarettes would be banned in the United

23     States, right?

24         A.   The ones that are inhalable, yes.

25         Q.   Okay. So either cigarettes would have to be 3858

1     made so that people could not inhale them, right --

2         A.   That's right.

3         Q.   -- or they should be banned?

4         A.   Well, given the dangers associated with it,

5     yeah, I would certainly support that.

6         Q.   You obviously don't have the authority to ban

7     cigarettes, though, right?

8         A.   No.

9         Q.   You would agree that there is no such thing

10     as a safe lit cigarette, right?

11          A.   Sure.

12         Q.   Any cigarette that you buy and you light is

13     not going to be a completely safe cigarette, right?

14         A.   Not completely safe. Although, you can

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=667
15     design one that's not addictive.

16         Q.   If you burn tobacco paper, you're going to

17     generate a bunch of chemicals that can be carcinogenic,

18     right?

19         A.   If you inhale them, yes.

20         Q.   And with enough exposure, that can cause

21      cancer or heart disease or emphysema or other ailments,

22     right?

23         A.   Repeated exposure, yes, that's what causes

24     the diseases, yep.

25         Q.   Okay. Now, you would agree, also, would you 3859

1     not, that light -- that light cigarettes are addictive?

2         A.   What do you mean, light?

3         Q.   Cigarettes marketed as light cigarettes. Are

4     they addictive?

5         A.   They're not allowed to market them as light

6     anymore.

7         Q.   I'm not talking right now. Cigarettes that

8     now or in the past at any time were marketed as light

9     cigarettes, do you think they're addictive?

10         A.   Cigarettes that are commercially sold today

11      and in the past that have been marketed as light are

12     addictive, yes.

13         Q.   Same is true for full-flavored cigarettes,

14     they are addictive, too?

15         A.   They're no different.

16         Q.   Filtered cigarettes, addictive?

17         A.   Yes.

18         Q.   Cigarettes with additives, addictive?

19         A.   Yes, sir.

20         Q.   Cigarettes without additives, addictive?

21          A.   It can be, depending on the amount of

22     nicotine that's in the product.

23         Q.   All right. None of these types of cigarettes

24     that I just mentioned are any safer than any other

25     commercially available cigarettes, right? 3860

1         A.   That's not true. There are commercially

2     available cigarettes with very low levels of nicotine

3     that don't create dependence.

4         Q.   All right. Let me ask you, Mrs. Loyd smoked

5     cigarettes in the 1950s, right?

6         A.   That's right.

7         Q.   Can you agree with me that there were no

8     commercially available cigarettes in the 1950s that

9     were any less addictive than the cigarettes Mrs. Loyd

10     actually smoked?

11          A.   Commercially available, I'll agree.

12         Q.   All right. And Mrs. Loyd smoked cigarettes

13     in the 1960s, also, right?

14         A.   That's right.

15         Q.   Can you agree with me that there were no

16     commercially available cigarettes in the 1960s that

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=668
17     were any less addictive than the cigarettes Mrs. Loyd

18     smoked?

19         A.   Yes.

20         Q.   Same question. Mrs. Loyd smoked cigarettes

21      in the 1970s, right?

22         A.   That's right.

23         Q.   There were no commercially available

24     cigarettes in the 1970s, available to Mrs. Loyd, that

25     were any less addictive than the cigarettes she smoked, 3861

1     were there?

2         A.   I would agree with that.

3         Q.   Mrs. Loyd smoked cigarettes in the 1980's,

4     right?

5         A.   That's right.

6         Q.   Same question. There were no commercially

7     available cigarettes available to Mrs. Loyd in the

8      1980s that were any less addictive than the cigarettes

9     she actually did smoke, correct?

10         A.   Commercially available meaning where she

11      lived?

12         Q.   Commercially available cigarettes available

13     to Mrs. Loyd. There weren't any that were less

14     addictive than the ones she smoked, right?

15         A.   Wrong.

16         Q.   Okay.

17         A.   There were. I mean, there were nicotine --

18     produced nicotine cigarettes that were available even

19     here in Florida in the 1980s.

20         Q.   Where in Florida?

21          A.   Tampa.

22         Q.   What product was available in Tampa?

23         A.   They were marketing a product, Philip Morris,

24     called "denic" cigarette, also marketed under the name,

25     Merit DeNic, and Benson & Hedges DeNic. 3862

1          Q.   Haven't you testified that denies were not

2     available in the Tampa area?

3         A.   No. I don't believe so. That was in three

4     test markets; Richmond, Tampa and Hartford,

5     Connecticut.

6         Q.   Actually, haven't you testified they were

7     available for -- in Richmond, Virginia, and Hartford,

8     Connecticut?

9         A.   Yes. And Tampa, Florida. There were three

10     test cities.

11          Q.   Okay.

12         A.   Okay.

13         Q.   All right. By the way, did you see any

14     evidence in the records that Mrs. Loyd ever tried or

15     was even interested in DeNics or any of the other

16     brands you suggested were available here in Tampa in

17     the 1980s?

18         A.   No.

19         Q.   You talked a little bit about roll-your-own

20     cigarettes, right?

21          A.   Not really.

22         Q.   Didn't you talk about --

23         A.   Talked about rabbit tobacco.

24         Q.   Rabbit tobacco?

25         A.   Yes. It's when you pick it off the plant and 3863

1     roll it in a piece of paper. It's different than a

2     roll-your-own cigarette.

3         Q.   A roll-your-own cigarette would be what, you

4     buy the tobacco and roll it yourself?

5         A.   Yes. It's highly processed blended tobacco

6     that you roll in a piece of paper. You can even now

7     get filters that come along with it.

8         Q.   But not a commercial cigarette, right?

9         A.   Roll-your-own is not a commercial cigarette,

10     in the sense that it's tailor-made in the factory.

11          Q.   The same point is true, though, that if you

12     smoke enough roll-your-own cigarettes, they can be

13     addictive too, right?

14         A.   Sure.

15         Q.   In fact, you've published on that topic, have

16     you not?

17         A.   I've published on what topic?

18         Q.   On the topic of roll-your-own cigarettes and

19     the fact that they can be addictive?

20         A.   I've published on roll-your-own cigarettes on

21      trend, not on the latter part.

22         Q.   All right. But you studied roll-your-own

23     cigarette smokers compared to smokers of factory-made

24     cigarettes like those made by Reynolds and Lorillard,

25     right? 3864

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   Okay. And in the papers that you published,

3     you and your co-authors reported that roll-your-own

4     smokers appeared to be more addicted than smokers of

5     factory-made cigarettes, right?

6         A.   In some instances, that's true.

7         Q.   You and the other people who -- your

8     co-authors reported that roll-your-own smokers appear

9     to be more addicted, claimed to inhale more deeply than

10     factory-made smokers, and believed that roll-your-own

11      tobacco was less harmful than other forms of tobacco;

12     is that right?

13         A.   That's right.

14         Q.   And that they were less interested in

15     quitting; is that right?

16         A.   That's right. They were more addicted.

17         Q.   You also found that people who smoke

18     roll-your-own cigarettes may be at more risk for

19     smoking-related diseases than people who smoke

20     factory-made cigarettes like those Reynolds and

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=670
21      Lorillard makes, right?

22         A.   Yes. But I can explain. Because they were

23     prior factory smokers, factory cigarette smokers, and

24     they switched over to roll-your-own because of cost.

25         Q.   Why don't you start by telling me whether you 3865

1      can identify any scientific studies published in the

2     peer-reviewed literature that indicate that smokers of

3     manufactured cigarettes have a greater degree of

4     nicotine dependence than smokers of hand-rolled

5     cigarettes? You can't, can you?

6         A.   Well, offhand, I can't think of any studies.

7     I haven't memorized every study. I'm sure there are

8     studies out there.

9         Q.   Now, you showed the jury, during your

10     presentation with Mr. Uiterwyk, a list of --1 think

11      the slides said something about additives in

12     cigarettes, during your direct. Do you remember that?

13         A.   Sure.

14         Q.   And I think you were trying to make the

15     point, or one of the points you were making, is that

16     additives -- some additives make cigarettes taste

17     better; is that right?

18         A.   That's one of the purposes of some of the

19     additives.

20         Q.   Some of the additives make -- at least you

21      contend some of the additives make cigarette smoke

22     easier to inhale?

23         A.   Not just my contention but, yes, that's true,

24     they do.

25         Q.   You were the one in the witness stand, right? 3866

1              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, argumentative, Your

2         Honor.

3              MR. WALKER: I'll withdraw it.

4     BY MR. WALKER:

5         Q.   Now, you know that for many years the tobacco

6     companies have submitted a list to the federal

7     government of the ingredients used in the manufacture

8     of commercially available cigarettes, right?

9         A.   That's right.

10         Q.   And those disclosures began in 1985?

11          A.   Correct.

12         Q.   And since those disclosures began, the

13     companies disclosed to the Department of Health and

14     Human Services that certain additives were present in

15     tobacco, right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   Health and Human Services is the same

18     department that the Surgeon General is a part of,

19     right?

20         A.   That's true.

21          Q.   Now, the federal government in response to

22     those submissions has never -- not once -- told the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=671
23     companies that they needed to remove any one of the

24     additives in cigarettes, have they?

25         A.   I don't believe they have. 3867

1          Q.   Now, are you aware of the book that R. J.

2     Reynolds published in 1972 called Tobacco Flavoring For

3     Smoking Products?

4         A.   No.

5         Q.   Now, let me ask you, there are cigarettes

6     made without additives, aren't there?

7         A.   A few.

8         Q.   But the FTC requires that anyone who makes a

9     cigarette without additives has to put right there on

10     the package that it's no safer than cigarettes with

11      additives, right?

12         A.   They did that in relationship to Winston, I

13     believe, when they advertised no additives. That was

14     true.

15         Q.   All right. There isn't one public health

16     organization that says that cigarettes would be safer

17     if they were made without additives, is there?

18         A.   No, because we don't really know. There's

19     not been a study to compare the long-term health risks.

20         Q.   Well, the public health community has not

21      concluded that additive-free cigarettes are any less

22     risky for lung cancer than those containing additives?

23         A.   That's not true at all. There's studies that

24     have appeared that talk about the increasing relative

25     risk likely due to some of the additives in cigarettes. 3868

1          Q.   Do you remember being asked that same

2     question in a case called Walker, last year?

3         A.   Yes.

4         Q.   Walker unrelated to me, though, right?

5         A.   Unrelated to you, yes.

6         Q.   Unrelated to me, okay.

7              And you gave a different answer last year,

8     didn't you?

9         A.   Yes. This study just came out. I would be

10     happy to tell you that study if you would like.

11          Q.   All right. So at the time of your testimony

12     previously, you agreed that the public health

13     community --

14              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, Your Honor. He's

15         explained his answer. There's no impeachment to

16         be done.

17              THE COURT: Overruled.

18     BY MR. WALKER:

19         Q.   So last year, you would have agreed that up

20     until 2000, what is it, 12 -- up until 2012, the public

21      health community had not concluded that any

22     additive-free cigarettes were less risky for lung

23     cancer than those containing additives, correct?

24         A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=672
25        Q.   That conclusion, no one in the public health 3869

1      community had reached that conclusion at any point

2     during Mrs. Loyd's lifetime; is that right?

3         A.   Well, no, that's no one in the public health

4     community --1 can cite to certain people that

5     certainly talked about this in the public health

6     community, and now there's evidence.

7         Q.   Well, last year did you not testify that the

8     public health community had not concluded that

9     additive-free cigarettes are any less risky for lung

10     cancer than those containing additives?

11          A.   Yeah. I think the consensus has been reached

12     now, now that the data are in.

13         Q.   You also talked about reconstituted tobacco

14     during direct, right?

15         A.   Right.

16         Q.   And reconstituted tobacco means that

17     different parts of tobacco are, for lack of a better

18     word, chopped up, the liquid is extracted from it, and

19     then it's reapplied at a later stage in the process,

20     right?

21          A.   Manufactured. Manmade. Yes.

22         Q.   Well, they start with tobacco, right?

23         A.   Tobacco, stems, stalks, reused tobacco, as I

24     mentioned, that they haven't sold.

25         Q.   Right. 3870

1         A.   They bring it back, they do super critical

2     extraction on it. They are left with the liquid they

3     call the rich brown liquor, and then they reapply that

4     that contains the nicotine. And they reapply color to

5     give it a familiar color because they've removed all

6     the coloring, as well as other additives.

7         Q.   Now, the process of generating reconstituted

8     tobacco actually removes nicotine, right?

9         A.   It removes nicotine.

10         Q.   And what goes back on to the sheet actually

11      has less nicotine than what comes off, right?

12         A.   Yes.

13         Q.   So when you go through the reconstituted

14     tobacco process, the end result is that you end up with

15     less nicotine than you started with, right?

16         A.   Unless you augment it. There are studies

17     where they add back more nicotine. They call that

18     augmentation.

19         Q.   Well, I'm not asking you about augmentation.

20     I'm just asking you about the process of reconstituted

21      tobacco that you just described. The end result is

22     less nicotine than you started with, right?

23         A.   It can be, unless you augment it.

24         Q.   All right. The U.S. Surgeon General has said

25     that reconstituted tobacco is a good thing because it 3871

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=673
1     brings down the overall levels of tar; is that right?

2         A.   That's right. If you only burn reconstituted

3     tobacco, you get less byproducts of the burning of tar.

4         Q.   And the Surgeon General has reported that the

5     use of reconstituted tobacco seemed to generate smoke

6     that was less tumorigenic, cancer causing, in animal

7     tests compared to cigarettes that did not have

8     reconstituted tobacco, correct?

9         A.   Yes.

10         Q.   All right. I want to go to some other

11      aspects of the cigarette design story that I think you

12     may have left out of your direct examination. What I

13     want to do --

14              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

15              THE COURT: (Indicates affirmatively.)

16     BY MR. WALKER:

17         Q.   And I've just handed you a memorandum that

18     purports to be a document from September 1968 from A.H.

19     Galloway to Dr. Murray Senkus. Do you see that?

20         A.   I do.

21          Q.   And you've seen this document before, right?

22         A.   I have.

23         Q.   This is one of those documents that's part of

24     the bigger, larger group of documents that you reviewed

25     in forming your opinions for this and other cases, 3872

1     right?

2         A.   It's part of the document archive and, yes,

3     I've seen this.

4         Q.   All right. Now, this document is from around

5      1968. And by that time, it was widely known, was it

6     not, that the federal government through the National

7     Cancer Institute was thinking about putting together

8     something called the Tobacco Working Group, right?

9         A.   Yes.

10         Q.   And Mr. Galloway that's referenced in this

11      document was the president of Reynolds in 1968, right?

12         A.   That's right.

13         Q.   Dr. Senkus was head of research and design?

14         A.   That's right.

15         Q.   So would it be fair to say that this was a

16     letter from the top boss to the top scientist at

17     Reynolds?

18         A.   Yes.

19         Q.   All right.

20              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, may I display this

21          memorandum to the jury?

22              THE COURT: Any objection?

23              MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

24              THE COURT: All right.

25     BY MR. WALKER: 3873

1          Q.   Okay. September 28th, Galloway to Senkus.

2     You would agree with me that this memo is discussing

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=674
3     plans for 1969, right?

4         A.   Correct.

5         Q.   Putting it in layman's terms again, sort of

6     the boss's expectations for the top scientist for the

7     work in the coming year; is that right?

8              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, objection. He's

9         asking for meaning of the document. The document

10         speaks for itself.

11               MR. WALKER: I'll withdraw the question, Your

12         Honor.

13              THE COURT: Sustained.

14     BY MR. WALKER:

15         Q.   If we could turn to page 3. All right.

16     Areas of special emphasis. I'm going to read it and

17     you tell me if I make a mistake.

18               "One, in cooperation with others you should

19     push the work concerning tobacco and health. You

20     should prepare a plan to foster any relationship with

21      the government person -- with government personnel in

22     the quest for mutual understanding of facts ultimately

23     to gain their cooperation in proper research of the

24     subject."

25              Did I read that correctly? 3874

1         A.   You did.

2         Q.   Okay. "Number 2, if there is a, quote, safer

3     cigarette, end quote, let's continue and increase our

4     efforts in this program. Please prepare a plan to

5     carry it out." Did I read that right?

6         A.   You did.

7         Q.   All right. This is the top boss telling the

8     top scientist in an internal memo to go out there and

9     plan on a safer cigarette, right?

10         A.   Yes.

11          Q.   In 1968?

12         A.   Right.

13         Q.   All right. Now, at that time in 1968, both

14     Reynolds and Lorillard had been invited to participate

15     in the National Cancer Institute Tobacco Working Group,

16     right?

17         A.   That's right.

18         Q.   That was a group that lasted for about ten

19     years?

20         A.   Correct.

21          Q.   The Tobacco Working Group was created under

22     the direction of the National Cancer Institute?

23         A.   Yes.

24         Q.   And the National Cancer Institute, again, is

25     part of the federal government, right? 3875

1         A.   Correct.

2         Q.   And a number of different people participated

3     in this effort, right?

4         A.   Yes, they did.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=675
5         Q.   Including representatives of the major

6     tobacco companies, right?

7         A.   That's right.

8         Q.   Including Reynolds?

9         A.   Correct.

10         Q.   And Lorillard?

11          A.   That's right.

12         Q.   And two scientists from Reynolds who

13     participated in the Tobacco Working Group were

14     Dr. Senkus and Dr. Rodgman; right?

15         A.   That's right.

16         Q.   Dr. Spears, of Lorillard Tobacco Company, was

17     invited to be a member as well, right?

18         A.   Yes.

19         Q.   There were also members of the National

20     Cancer Institute in the Tobacco Working Group, right?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   And other federal agencies were represented,

23     like the Department of Agriculture?

24         A.   Yes.

25         Q.   Members of the public health community also 3876

1     participated, right?

2         A.   Yes.

3         Q.   Including Dr. Bock --

4         A.   Yes.

5         Q.    from Roswell Park where you worked?

6         A.   Yes.

7         Q.   Now, the stated objective of the National

8     Cancer Institute's Tobacco Working Group was to see if

9     it was possible to develop a less hazardous cigarette,

10     right?

11          A.   That was one of the objectives.

12         Q.   And the Tobacco Working Group looked at

13     different designs, right?

14         A.   They did.

15         Q.   Designs regarding filters, tobacco blends,

16     ventilation, porous paper, anything to achieve the aim

17     of developing a less hazardous cigarette; right?

18         A.   That's right.

19         Q.   In fact, two of the scientists from Reynolds,

20     the ones that I mentioned, Dr. Senkus and Dr. Rodgman,

21      they were personally thanked by the National Cancer

22     Institute for their contributions to the Tobacco

23     Working Group, right?

24         A.   They weren't the only ones thanked. Everyone

25     who served was thanked. 3877

1          Q.   Let me try again.

2         A.   Yes, they were thanked along with everyone

3     else on the committee.

4         Q.   All right. You've seen the correspondence

5     where the National Cancer Institute thanked Dr. Senkus

6     and Dr. Rodgman from Reynolds and, also, Dr. Spears

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=676
7     from Lorillard for their participation, right?

8         A.   Sure. I've seen a lot of correspondence from

9     the Tobacco Working Group.

10         Q.   While we're on the topic of industry

11      scientists, let's talk about Claude Teague. He came up

12     a lot in your presentation. Remember that?

13         A.   Yes.

14         Q.   You showed a memo, for example, from 1953,

15     that Claude Teague wrote, right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   Now, in 1953, Dr. Teague was only about

18     25 years old, right?

19         A.   True.

20         Q.   Okay. And at the time he wrote it, he didn't

21      have any experience in cancer or tobacco research, did

22     he?

23         A.   He was a chemist. I don't know what his

24     experience was. He was a Ph.D. chemist.

25         Q.   Haven't you testified that he had no 3878

1      experience in cancer or tobacco research?

2         A.   Yeah. I don't think he was considered a

3     cancer scientist. So I'm not sure what I testified to,

4     but I mean, he was a chemist, a Ph.D. chemist, that's

5     what I said.

6         Q.   Let me give you a chance to take a look.

7     This is your testimony from Campbell in 2009. You

8     remember that trial, right?

9         A.   I do.

10         Q.   You were giving testimony then, just like you

11      are today, under oath from the witness box with a court

12     reporter, right?

13         A.   Yes.

14              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

15              THE COURT: Yes.

16     BY MR. WALKER:

17         Q.   Let's have a look at page 1360 from your

18     testimony in Campbell.

19         A.   Okay.

20         Q.   Let me know when you're there.

21          A.   I'm there. Go ahead.

22         Q.   I want to look at lines 10 through 12,

23     please?

24         A.   1360?

25         Q.   1360. 1360. 3879

1         A.   That must be Volume 11, then.

2              MR. UITERWYK: I don't have 1360.

3              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

4              THE COURT: Yes.

5     BY MR. WALKER:

6         Q.   We'll try again.

7         A.   Okay.

8         Q.   All right. So page 1360 of your sworn

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=677
9     testimony in the Campbell case. Let me know when you

10     found it.

11          A.   Found it.

12         Q.   Okay. Question, he was about 25 years old,

13     no experience in cancer or tobacco research; isn't that

14     right? Answer, that's right.

15              That was your testimony, right?

16         A.   Yeah.

17         Q.   Okay. Now, I want to be clear that we know

18     what we're talking about.

19              MR. WALKER: Can we just go to the ELMO for a

20         second?

21      BY MR. WALKER:

22         Q.   So the memo that we've been talking about is

23     this memo from Claude Teague, in 1953, right?

24         A.   It's a literature review. It's not a memo.

25         Q.   Okay. A literature review from Claude Teague 3880

1     in 1953, right?

2         A.   Right.

3         Q.   Now, what Dr. Teague did here in this memo

4     was just to review the literature, right? That's why

5     you just corrected me and called it a literature

6     review, right?

7         A.   That's right.

8         Q.   All right. Teague was looking at published

9     sources when he wrote this memo, right?

10         A.   Seventy-eight.

11          Q.   Well, that means that he went to the library

12     or some other public source, looked at what was

13     published on the possible relationship of smoking and

14     cancer, right?

15         A.   Correct.

16         Q.   He didn't do original research in this memo,

17     did he?

18         A.   No. He was reporting a review of the

19     literature.

20         Q.   He wasn't relying on some secret internal

21      company knowledge for this, was he?

22         A.   No. He was relying on the published

23     literature on the topic.

24         Q.   And just as 25-year-old Dr. Teague did, any

25     other scientist could have gone out and done a 3881

1     literature search and found the same literature that

2     Dr. Teague did, just like he did, right?

3         A.   That's probably true.

4         Q.   All right. And he cited --1 think you've

5     already mentioned Dr. Teague cited to 78 articles that

6     were all from the public literature in this paper,

7     right?

8         A.   That's right.

9         Q.   Including two of the epidemiological studies

10     that came out in 1950, the Wynder and Graham and the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=678
11      Doll and Hill studies; is that right?

12         A.   That's right.

13         Q.   And that's why in the back of this document

14     you see a bibliography, right?

15         A.   Right.

16         Q.   And when you came up with that number of 78

17     different published sources, that's because it starts

18     at one and goes all the way to 78, right?

19         A.   Correct.

20         Q.   Okay. And then on the second page of that

21     bibliography is where you see the examples I just asked

22     you about with Wynder and Graham, right?

23         A.   Yes.

24         Q.   And Doll and Hill?

25         A.   Yes. 3882

1          Q.   Okay. So all of the literature reviewed, 1

2     through 78, was publicly available to anyone who wanted

3     to read it, right?

4         A.   That's true.

5         Q.   It certainly was available to the Surgeon

6     General as well, right?

7         A.   Yes.

8         Q.   Now, nowhere in this document does Dr. Teague

9     state that smoking cigarettes has been proven to cause

10     disease in humans, does it?

11          A.   I don't know if he used that "proven" term.

12     He used -- he had conclusions that the clinical

13     research was consistent with the view that smoking was

14     a cause of lung cancer.

15         Q.   All right. So Dr. Teague did not state that

16     smoking cigarettes was proven to be a cause of disease

17     in humans?

18         A.   I don't recall. I haven't memorized every

19     word in the document. I'm just remembering the

20     conclusion.

21          Q.   Well, you don't remember seeing that in the

22     document, that cigarette smoking was proven to be a

23     cause of disease in humans?

24         A.   I'm not remembering that in the document.

25         Q.   All right. 3883

1         A.   One way or the other.

2         Q.   Well, let's see if you remember this part

3     that he did say.

4         A.   Okay.

5         Q.   This is on page 4 of the document.

6              "In spite of observation, research, and

7     theorizing for the past 2,000 years, the cause of

8     spontaneous human cancer is still unknown."

9              Right? Did I read that correctly?

10         A.   You did.

11               MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, for the sake of

12         the rule of completeness again, please, if we

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=679
13         could on page 5, the fourth paragraph, and also on

14         page 14, in the conclusion paragraph, publish to

15         the jury, please.

16              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I'm trying to move

17         through my cross.

18              THE COURT: Are they different pages?

19              MR. UITERWYK: They are.

20              THE COURT: Denied. You can do it on

21          redirect.

22              MR. UITERWYK: And it is in evidence,

23         Your Honor, at 13 -- 3608.

24              THE COURT: I'm sorry, Mr. Uiterwyk. I

25         didn't catch your last comment. 3884

1              MR. UITERWYK: I just said it was in evidence

2         identified as 3608.

3              MR. WALKER: I think it is in evidence,

4         Your Honor.

5              MR. UITERWYK: It is.

6     BY MR. WALKER:

7         Q.   Now, you also discussed another memo written

8     by Claude Teague. This is Plaintiffs 4791 from 1972,

9     right?

10         A.   Yes. April.

11          Q.   Research planning memorandum on the nature of

12     the tobacco business and the crucial role of nicotine

13     therein, right?

14         A.   That's right.

15         Q.   Okay. You showed a portion of this document

16     that used the phrase sine qua non, right?

17         A.   Yes, sir.

18         Q.   That wasn't the first time that phrase had

19     been used with respect to nicotine, was it?

20         A.   No.

21          Q.   Okay. Sine qua non means that something is

22     an essential element, right?

23         A.   That's right.

24              MR. WALKER: Okay. May I approach,

25         Your Honor? 3885

1              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

2     BY MR. WALKER:

3         Q.   Sure.

4              All right. So you showed the jury

5     Dr. Teague's memo from 1972.

6              I've just handed you a Reader's Digest

7     article from January of 1950; is that right?

8         A.   Yes, you have.

9         Q.   Okay. And the article is entitled "How

10     Harmful Are Cigarettes," right?

11          A.   That's right.

12         Q.   And this is another one of those articles

13     that you've seen before, right?

14         A.   Yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=680
15         Q.   Part of the literature that makes -- that was

16     part of the larger body of literature that you reviewed

17     and that has influenced your opinions, right?

18         A.   I've seen this article before.

19              MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I would like

20         to display the Reader's Digest article from 1950.

21               MR. UITERWYK: Other than my prior

22         objections, no objection, Your Honor.

23              THE COURT: All right.

24     BY MR. WALKER:

25         Q.   All right. Reader's Digest at the top, 3886

1     January 1950, "How Harmful Are Cigarettes" by

2     Roger Riis.

3              I want to take a look at page 2 of this

4     article.

5         A.   Okay.

6         Q.   Just a minute ago, you told me sine qua non

7     basically means the same thing as essential, right?

8         A.   That's right.

9         Q.   Okay. "Nicotine is the essential ingredient

10     of tobacco. It is what makes tobacco tobacco and not

11     just another weed."

12              Did I read that correctly?

13         A.   You did.

14         Q.   Okay. And this was 22 years before

15     Dr. Teague's memo?

16         A.   Approximately.

17         Q.   Even before Reader's Digest printed this in

18      1950, you know that another scientist named Lennox

19     Johnston wrote about the same concept in 1942, right?

20         A.   In Lancet.

21          Q.   In The Lancet magazine.

22              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

23              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

24     BY MR. WALKER:

25         Q.   Sure. 3887

1              I'm guessing because you pulled out the

2     publication before I even asked you about it, that

3     you've seen this before, right?

4         A.   I have seen this before.

5         Q.   This is part of the larger body of scientific

6     or other literature that you reviewed that influenced

7     your opinions, right?

8         A.   I've seen this article before. It's been

9     cited in Surgeon General's reports.

10              MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I would like

11          to publish the article from Lancet from looks like

12         December 1942.

13              MR. UITERWYK: Can I have a continuing

14         objection on the hearsay?

15              THE COURT: Lay a better predicate on this

16         exhibit, Mr. Walker.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=681
17     BY MR. WALKER:

18         Q.   This is an exhibit that you mentioned from

19     memory, right, The Lancet article that I'm referring to

20     from Lennox Johnston?

21          A.   I've seen this before.

22         Q.   You've seen it and you've seen it referenced

23     in the Surgeon General's reports that you rely on as

24     part of the body of scientific literature that you've

25     reviewed, right? 3888

1         A.   Yes. It's one of the hundred thousand or so

2     articles cited by Surgeon General's reports.

3         Q.   And it's one of the hundred thousand or so

4     Surgeon General cited articles that you've reviewed

5     before and that you've taken into account in forming

6     your opinions and giving your testimony, right?

7         A.   I've seen it before.

8         Q.   And you've been asked about it before, right?

9         A.   I have at trial.

10              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, at this time I would

11          ask to display the article.

12              MR. UITERWYK: Same objection, Your Honor.

13              THE COURT: Approach, please.

14              (At sidebar.)

15              THE COURT: There's a difference in my mind

16         between the witness saying his -- his testimony

17         sort of varies a little bit from document to

18         document. I'm not drawing any conclusions from

19         that other than perhaps some of them he's seen but

20         doesn't necessarily mean he's relied upon it. And

21          that's what he said with respect to this document,

22         that he's seen it before or it's been cited to him

23         in a Surgeon General's report, but he didn't say

24         he relied upon it. So without some reliance on

25         it, I don't know that you could cross-examine him 3889

1          on it based upon our prior discussions.

2              MR. WALKER: I'm happy to ask more questions,

3         Judge. I thought he had said earlier that he

4         relied on 

5              MR. UITERWYK: I don't believe he did.

6              MR. WALKER: Well -- that he relied on a big

7         body of scientific literature and he's agreed that

8         this is part of that. But I'm happy to ask

9         further questions, Your Honor.

10              THE COURT: Okay. That's it.

11               (Sidebar concluded.)

12     BY MR. WALKER:

13         Q.   It looks like that bench conference was right

14     on time.

15              Okay. So you've got the article there in

16     front of you, right?

17         A.   I do.

18         Q.   You're certainly familiar with Lancet

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=682
19     magazine?

20         A.   lam.

21          Q.   That's a distinguished periodical that

22     scientists and people in the public health community

23     rely on?

24         A.   It is.

25         Q.   And you mentioned that you've seen this 3890

1      article before, right?

2         A.   That's right.

3         Q.   And you've taken this article into account in

4     the testimony that you've given in the time that you --

5     and the time since you've seen this article, right?

6         A.   I've seen the article. And as I've testified

7     previously, I've reviewed many articles. And that's

8     just part of the scientific knowledge that I've

9     acquired over 33 years of doing work in this area.

10         Q.   Including this article?

11          A.   Sure.

12         Q.   So the opinions that you've given that are in

13     reliance on, everything that you've reviewed over the

14     years, not only as someone who's researched this area

15     but somebody who's testified about this area

16     repeatedly, this is a part of that body of information

17     that you've reviewed and that you're relying on for the

18     answers that you give, right?

19         A.   It's not a special basis for my opinions, no.

20     It's not something I --

21          Q.   I'm not asking if it's a --

22         A.   -- you know, uniquely rely on for my

23     opinions, but it is part of the body of literature that

24     I've reviewed.

25         Q.   Okay. If we wanted to understand the body of 3891

1     literature that you reviewed, this would be a part of

2     it, right?

3         A.   I've seen it before, yeah.

4         Q.   Well, you keep saying that you've seen it

5     before.

6         A.   I've read this article.

7         Q.   You've read this article. And have you not

8     taken this article into account in giving your

9     opinions?

10         A.   I've taken account of all the material that

11      I've reviewed in my professional career to form my

12     opinions. This is not uniquely reliable evidence. It

13     is consistent with the opinions that I have formed

14     about nicotine addiction.

15         Q.   Okay. Well, let me get to the bottom line.

16         A.   Okay.

17         Q.   Did you rely on this or not? Is this a

18     document that you saw with all the other documents that

19     you saw that you say you relied on or not?

20         A.   I have reviewed this article. That's what I

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=683
21      can answer. I don't know -- you know, it's not

22     uniquely something that I studied to form my opinions

23     in this case. It is part of the body of scientific

24     evidence that I have reviewed in my 33 years. It is

25     one of the articles that touches on smoking behavior 3892

1     that I have seen.

2         Q.   Well, it's not any different than all the

3     other articles that you've read in the sense that it's

4     part of that scientific evidence, right?

5         A.   True.

6              MR. WALKER: Okay. Your Honor, I would ask

7         to display this document.

8              THE COURT: Granted.

9     BY MR. WALKER:

10         Q.   All right. So The Lancet magazine, 1942,

11      right?

12         A.   Yes.

13         Q.   And let's take a look at the article just

14     right at the beginning of the article.

15               "Tobacco Smoking and Nicotine by

16     Lennox Johnston."

17              That's who we were just talking about, right?

18         A.   That's right.

19         Q.   Okay. And then right there in the very first

20     sentence, do you see where it says there, "On the

21      assumption that smoking tobacco is essentially a means

22     of administering nicotine, just as smoking opium is a

23     means of administering morphine."

24              Do you see that?

25         A.   That's right. 3893

1          Q.   Okay.

2         A.   It goes on to say they were going to inject

3     it-

4         Q.   That's not--what?

5              MR. UITERWYK: I was going to ask for the

6         rule of completeness if you could read the rest of

7         that sentence, please.

8              MR. WALKER: Okay. I'll start over.

9              Where do you want me to stop, 35?

10              MR. UITERWYK: Yeah.

11               MR. WALKER: All right.

12     BY MR. WALKER:

13         Q.   "On the assumption that smoking tobacco is

14     essentially a means of administering nicotine, just as

15     smoking opium is a means of administering morphine,

16     nicotine was given hypodermically to 35 volunteers in

17     known doses with a view to comparing its effects and

18     particularly its psychic effects with those of tobacco

19     smoking. Seven received single doses, but the others

20     doses ranging in number from 2 to 35."

21               Did I read that correctly?

22         A.   You did.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=684
23         Q.   All right. Whether I read just the

24     highlighting or that whole sentence, the fact of the

25     matter is, this is a document from 1942 that's 3894

1     referring to smoking of tobacco as a means of

2     administering nicotine, right?

3         A.   On the assumption. That's what they're

4     testing.

5         Q.   All right. Let's go back to the 1988 Surgeon

6     General's report in evidence. Did I already bring you

7     acopyofthefull'88?

8         A.   I believe you did.

9         Q.   Do you want another one, or are you good?

10         A.   No, I'm good.

11          Q.   Okay. Now, I would like to refer to page 10

12     of this document.

13         A.   Okay.

14         Q.   It's the 1988 Surgeon General's report.

15               "As early as the 1920s and 1930s, some

16     investigators were concluding that nicotine was

17     responsible for the compulsive use of tobacco products.

18     Armstrong-Jones '27; Dorsey 1936; Lewin 1931. Johnston

19     (1942) concluded that smoking tobacco is essentially a

20     means of administering nicotine, just as smoking opium

21      is a means of administering morphine."

22              Did I read that correctly?

23         A.   You did.

24         Q.   All right. And that's a cite to Lewin from

25      1931 as well, right? 3895

1         A.   Correct.

2         Q.   That would be 41 years before Dr. Teague's

3      1972 memo, right?

4         A.   Yes.

5         Q.   All right. You're familiar with the Lewin

6     article that's cited there, right?

7         A.   I believe I am, yeah.

8         Q.   You know just from your own research that

9     Dr. Lewin reported that the decisive factor in the

10     effects of tobacco, desired or undesired, is nicotine,

11      right?

12         A.   I believe that's what he said.

13         Q.   And when Dr. Teague wrote in 1972 that

14     nicotine was the sine qua non, that's the same point,

15     right?

16         A.   Yes.

17         Q.   Now, at the time that Dr. Teague's memo, the

18     last one we were looking at, was written in the

19      1970s -- are you with me in time period, the 1970s?

20         A.   Yep.

21          Q.    other distinguished scientists like

22     Dr. Michael Russell were recommending research into a

23     low tar medium nicotine cigarette, right?

24         A.   A low tar medium nicotine, yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=685
25        Q.   And that relates to something called the 3896

1     tar-to-nicotine ratio, correct?

2         A.   Correct.

3         Q.   And essentially the ratio just compares the

4     amount of tar to the amount of nicotine, right?

5         A.   That's right.

6         Q.   Okay. So when a person talks about reducing

7     the tar-to-nicotine ratio, that means that you want to

8     decrease the amount of tar while keeping the same

9     amount of nicotine, right?

10         A.   Changing that ratio.

11          Q.   Changing the ratio?

12         A.   Yeah, which is traditionally ten to one.

13         Q.   The idea was to lower the tar as much as

14     possible while maintaining a certain level of nicotine,

15     right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   Okay. And so Dr. Russell's rationale for

18     that was that people smoked for nicotine, but they died

19     from the tar, right?

20         A.   That wasn't only his idea, but he did state

21      that idea. But I've seen that idea stated by others.

22         Q.   Okay.

23         A.   Earlier --

24         Q.   He wasn't the only one to say that.

25         A.   Yeah. Much earlier by people within the 3897

1      companies.

2         Q.   And by the way, I think I asked you about

3     Dr. Russell. He wasn't part of a conspiracy with the

4     tobacco companies, was he?

5         A.   You did ask and, no, he wasn't.

6         Q.   Okay. So the idea that Dr. Russell and

7     others had was that maybe if we keep the tar out, then

8     people would get nicotine, but they wouldn't get sick,

9     right?

10         A.   Yes.

11          Q.   Okay.

12         A.   Good idea.

13         Q.   Dr. Russell published papers on this in the

14     early to mid 1970s on this idea of a medium nicotine

15     low tar cigarette, right?

16         A.   He did publish a paper on that.

17         Q.   Including in peer-reviewed scientific

18     journals, right?

19         A.   I think BMJ, right, British Medical Journal.

20         Q.   All right.

21               MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

22              THE COURT: Yes.

23              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

24     BY MR. WALKER:

1              Now, you just referenced the British Medical

2     Journal. That's the same article I just handed you,

3     right?

4         A.   Correct.

5         Q.   "Low Tar Medium Nicotine Cigarettes: A New

6     Approach to Safer Smoking," right?

7         A.   That's right.

8         Q.   Okay. Now, this is another one of those

9     articles that was part of the scientific literature

10     that you reviewed and relied on as a group in giving

11      your testimony, right?

12         A.   I've reviewed this. So it is part of the

13     knowledge base that I have.

14         Q.   Okay. Let's see. Give me just a moment.

15              All right. So -- may I display this

16     document, Your Honor?

17              THE COURT: Yes.

18              MR. UITERWYK: Same objection, Your Honor.

19              THE COURT: All right.

20     BY MR. WALKER:

21          Q.   So this is the article we were just talking

22     about, right?

23         A.   Yes.

24              MR. WALKER: And if we could just go to the

25         next page. 3899

1     BY MR. WALKER:

2         Q.   And that's what we were just talking about as

3     well, right? People smoke for nicotine, but they die

4     from the tar, right?

5         A.   That's right.

6         Q.   Okay. Now, you know from your review of the

7     documents that Reynolds and Lorillard were following

8     Dr. Russell's writings and looking into the issue,

9     right?

10         A.   Well, they followed a lot of people's

11      writings, yes, including Dr. Russell's, yes. But they

12     were doing other independent research on their own.

13              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

14              THE COURT: Yes.

15     BY MR. WALKER:

16         Q.   Okay. This is one of the documents that

17     you've seen that you were just referring to, right?

18     This is actually a Reynolds document, correct?

19         A.   It is a Reynolds document.

20         Q.   This is an example of the type of document

21      that you've seen that shows that the companies were

22     following Dr. Russell and others, right?

23         A.   No. I don't believe I've seen this before,

24     but I can identify it as a Reynolds document.

25         Q.   You haven't seen this document from Murray 3900

1      Senkus to J.F. Hines?

2         A.   Not offhand.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=687
3         Q.   All right. Take a look, if you would, just

4     at page 5.

5         A.   Sure.

6         Q.   We won't publish it yet. I just want to make

7     sure that you're sure you actually haven't seen this

8     document before.

9              If you would just look at the bottom of

10     page 5, see if that refreshes your recollection about

11      whether this is one of the documents that you've seen

12     that I was just asking you about in terms of following

13     Dr. Russell.

14              Still don't remember?

15         A.   I don't believe I've seen this document

16     before. I certainly am aware of the fact that, you

17     know, Reynolds and other companies did track the

18     research. And certainly I've been asked previously

19     about Dr. Russell's work, but I don't recall seeing

20     this specific document.

21          Q.   If you haven't seen it, I won't ask you about

22     it.

23         A.   Okay.

24         Q.   All right. Now, this strategy that

25     Dr. Russell was talking about of a medium nicotine low 3901

1     tar cigarette, that was a strategy that was discussed

2     also by other scientists and members of the public

3     health community, right?

4         A.   Other scientists, I would say yes.

5     Helmut Wakeham in 1959 talked about it at Philip

6     Morris.

7         Q.   Well, let me ask you about Sir Richard Doll.

8     Certainly you know who that is, right?

9         A.   Sure.

10         Q.   He was one of the pioneers of research on

11      smoking and cancer, right?

12         A.   Absolutely.

13         Q.   He published one of the first major studies

14     in the early 1950s, right?

15         A.   He did.

16         Q.   And I think you even referred to him as a

17     giant of science, right?

18         A.   He was.

19         Q.   Now, in addition to Dr. Russell,

20     Sir Richard Doll also suggested reducing the

21      tar-to-nicotine ratio, right?

22         A.   He did at certain points in his career.

23         Q.   Same concept, reduce the tar, maintain a

24     medium or higher level of nicotine, right?

25         A.   That's right. 3902

1          Q.   Okay. And we looked at the Surgeon General's

2     report --1 think we looked at it from 1981, right?

3         A.   We did.

4         Q.   Is that one of those that you have up there

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=688
5     still?

6         A.   It is.

7         Q.   You've got quite a stack going.

8         A.   I do.

9         Q.   Well, in that 1981 --let me ask you if you

10     remember first.

11               The 1981 Surgeon General's report also

12     discussed the idea of changing the tar-to-nicotine

13     ratio as a potential approach for making a safer

14     cigarette, right?

15         A.   Sure. It was summarizing some of the work

16     that had gone on in the prior decade.

17         Q.   Okay. And you've testified that the Surgeon

18     General's report in 1981 was the gold standard at that

19     time, right?

20         A.   I think I've said Surgeon General's reports

21      are the gold standard of knowledge at any given time.

22         Q.   So the 1981 Surgeon General's report would be

23     the gold standard for 1981?

24         A.   Yeah, based on that evidence at that time in

25     the published literature. 3903

1          Q.   One of the things the Surgeon General said in

2      1981 was that we needed to know what minimum amount of

3     nicotine is necessary to provide a satisfying cigarette

4     to a smoker, right?

5         A.   That's right.

6         Q.   Okay. Let's look at another memo from

7     Dr. Teague that you showed the jury.

8              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

9              THE COURT: Yes.

10              THE WITNESS: Thanks.

11      BY MR. WALKER:

12         Q.   Sure.

13              I've just handed you a document that's

14     already -- actually already in evidence. This one's by

15     Dr. Teague, right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   Let's see. Implications and Activities

18     Arising From -- and so forth.

19              You have that; I gave you the right document,

20     right?

21          A.   You did.

22         Q.   Okay. Now, let me back up for just a second.

23              You talked about pH levels in your direct

24     examination, right?

25         A.   That's right. 3904

1          Q.   And in connection with doing that, you showed

2     the jury this document by Claude Teague from 1973,

3     right?

4         A.   Yes. And there are some other documents

5     attached from, you know, Blevins and Mr. Moore.

6         Q.   Okay. And you -- essentially you testified

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=689
7     that additives were used to raise the pH of cigarettes

8     to affect the nicotine yield.

9         A.   Yes.

10         Q.   Okay. And let's see now. The idea the

11      additives could be used to speed up the delivery of

12     nicotine is just a theory, right?

13         A.   Well, at some point, it was just a theory.

14     It's not a theory any longer.

15         Q.   All right. There's no technique to measure

16     how rapidly nicotine reaches the brain, is there?

17         A.   Currently that's true. I mean, there are

18     some methods that are being worked on. But I would say

19     whether they're validated or not, I would say probably

20     not. They're using radio-labeled radiation tracers to

21      measure this in the brain using brain imaging and so

22     on.

23         Q.   Now, in connection with this document, I

24     believe you testified that pH levels above six give the

25     smoker a greater nicotine kick. 3905

1         A.   That's right. I think we were reading out of

2     a document.

3         Q.   But in this document, Plaintiffs 3291,

4     there's a chart that shows the pH levels in many

5     different brands of cigarettes, right?

6         A.   That's right.

7         Q.   It's on Bates 10 in your copy.

8         A.   Okay.

9         Q.   See that?

10         A.   Yes.

11          Q.   All right.

12              MR. WALKER: Can we zoom in just maybe at the

13         top first, get the title.

14     BY MR. WALKER:

15         Q.   Chart 3, Average Maximum Smoke pH of Tobacco

16     Materials and Products.

17              Looks like you're still looking for it.

18         A.   I am trying to get to 10. Sorry about that.

19         Q.   Take your time. I'll wait for you.

20         A.   That's okay. I got it.

21          Q.   Are you there now?

22         A.   lam.

23         Q.   And it lists a number of different brands,

24     right?

25         A.   That's right. 3906

1          Q.   Okay. And Winston is on the chart, right?

2         A.   That's right.

3         Q.   But Winston is below six, isn't it?

4         A.   At that time, yes.

5         Q.   Okay. Marlboro is above six, right?

6         A.   That's right. And Kool.

7         Q.   And Kool. But Mrs. Loyd wasn't smoking

8     Marlboro or Kool, was she?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=690
9         A.   No. Not at that time.

10         Q.   She was smoking Winston that's below the pH

11      level of six that you talked about, right?

12         A.   That's right.

13         Q.   Okay. Now, Reynolds has actually published

14     on ways to determine smoke pH, right?

15         A.   Yes, among other groups.

16              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

17     THE COURT: Yes.

18  BY MR. WALKER:

19         Q.   All right. This is an example of an article

20     that was published by Reynolds scientists on the topic

21      we were just talking about, right?

22         A.   Correct.

23         Q.   This one is entitled "A New Technique for

24     Determining the pH of Whole Tobacco Smoke," right?

25         A.   Yes. It's on how to measure it. 3907

1          Q.   All right. And this is another one of those

2     documents that's in that larger body of internal

3     documents and published literature that you've reviewed

4     and have formed your opinions, right?

5         A.   Sure.

6              MR. WALKER: May I display this, Your Honor?

7              THE COURT: Yes.

8     BY MR. WALKER:

9         Q.   So we already talked about the title, let's

10     just -- there you go. That's -- the authors are A.J.

11      Sensabaugh, Jr. and R.H. Cundiff, right?

12         A.   Correct.

13         Q.   They're in the research department of R.J.

14     Reynolds Tobacco Company, right?

15         A.   That's right.

16         Q.   Now, this article, this isn't an internal

17     document, is it?

18         A.   No.

19         Q.   This is something that was published in the

20     Journal of Tobacco Science, in February of 1967, right?

21          A.   That's right.

22         Q.   This is Reynolds' publication that's publicly

23     available, on smoke pH, as far back as 1967, right?

24         A.   Correct.

25         Q.   It's describing a method for determining 3908

1      smoke pH, correct?

2         A.   That's right.

3         Q.   Let's look at another Teague document you

4     showed the jury.

5              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

6              THE COURT: Yes.

7              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

8     BY MR. WALKER:

9         Q.   Sure.

10              MR. WALKER: Can he just explain that to the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=691
11         jury as we're talking about it?

12     BY MR. WALKER:

13         Q.   This document's already in evidence,

14     Dr. Cummings. This is another document from Dr.

15     Teague. This one is from 1982, right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   This was one that you talked about in your

18     examination?

19         A.   Correct.

20         Q.   All right. Now, at the top there, a little

21      hard to see on the screen, but at the top it's labeled

22     "draft," right?

23         A.   On this version that's true. There's other

24     versions that doesn't have that listed.

25         Q.   You've never seen a final version of this 3909

1      draft, have you?

2         A.   Yes, I have.

3         Q.   You have. When did you see that?

4         A.   When I went back and looked for other

5     versions that did not contain the word "draft."

6         Q.   And when was that?

7         A.   That was after the last time I was asked

8     about this document.

9         Q.   Okay. Can you give me a year? I'm asking

10     you for a year?

11          A.   Probably the last nine months or so.

12         Q.   All right. Now, you don't have any idea

13     whether this was actually ever sent to Dr. DiMarco, do

14     you?

15         A.   No, I don't.

16         Q.   In fact, there's no evidence that you've seen

17     that anyone else in the company ever received it,

18     either?

19         A.   This particular memo?

20         Q.   Yeah, this particular memo?

21          A.   No. I mean, I've seen the copy of the

22     Nordine report. That was copied to many people within

23     Reynolds.

24         Q.   We're talking about this memo, right?

25         A.   It's referencing the Nordine study. 3910

1          Q.   Let me try to ask a clear question.

2         A.   Okay.

3         Q.   Hopefully, a yes or no. You don't have any

4     evidence that anyone else in the company ever received

5     this memo that's in evidence?

6         A.   Yes, this memo only.

7         Q.   We've been talking about Dr. Teague. I want

8     to ask you now about Dr. Rodgman. You know who he is?

9         A.   Sure.

10         Q.   Okay. Dr. Rodgman was hired as an analytic

11      chemist in the summer of 1954, at Reynolds, right?

12         A.   That's right.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=692
13         Q.   He was a good chemist, right?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   Good scientist?

16         A.   I believe so.

17         Q.   Reynolds put him in a lab and asked him to

18     study what was in cigarette smoke, fair?

19         A.   They made him head of their chemistry unit,

20     analytic chemist.

21          Q.   They asked him to study what was in cigarette

22     smoke, right?

23         A.   Right.

24         Q.   In fact, his work helped advance the science

25     and identify smoke constituents, right? 3911

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   He actually developed a method that helped

3     all scientists figure out what was in cigarette smoke,

4     right?

5         A.   Yes.

6              MR. WALKER: May I approach with this

7         document, Your Honor?

8              THE COURT: Yes.

9              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

10     BY MR. WALKER:

11          Q.   Sure. All right. So Reynolds hires

12     Dr. Rodgman, right?

13         A.   That's right.

14         Q.   Then he starts an eight-year study into the

15     composition of cigarette smoke, right?

16         A.   True.

17         Q.   And basically, I said composition, he's just

18     trying to figure out what's in smoke, right?

19         A.   Yes.

20         Q.   Essentially, that's --

21          A.   Well, he's figuring out what the chemistry is

22     and he's also tracking other lines of evidence such as

23     pathology studies, the human clinical studies, as well

24     as the animal research.

25         Q.   And after eight years of research in 1964, he 3912

1     writes a summary report, right?

2         A.   He did, February of '64.

3         Q.   That would be the report I just handed you,

4     right?

5         A.   Yes, I'm familiar with it.

6         Q.   Now, in between he wrote interim reports as

7     new findings were uncovered, right?

8         A.   On pretty much an annual basis, he put out

9     reports.

10         Q.   Okay. But what I handed you was the 1964

11      report, right?

12         A.   That's true.

13         Q.   You're familiar with that?

14         A.   I am.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=693
15         Q.   It's one of the many documents, internal or

16     public, that form the body of literature that you

17     reviewed and that in forming your opinions, right?

18         A.   Right. On page 70, he references the other

19     reports.

20              MR. WALKER: Okay. I would like to display

21          Dr. Rodgman's 1964 report.

22              THE COURT: All right.

23              MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

24              THE COURT: Overruled.

25              MR. UITERWYK: I said, No objection, Your 3913

1         Honor.

2              THE COURT: Oh, okay. You got me on that

3         one.

4              MR. UITERWYK: Didn't mean to, Judge.

5              THE COURT: Okay.

6     BY MR. WALKER:

7         Q.   Now, you can't tell by looking at it on the

8     screen, but this is a 70-page report, right?

9         A.   That's right.

10         Q.   All right. Now, in Dr. Rodgman's report, he

11      talks about the intensive investigation he did in his

12     lab over the past eight years, right?

13         A.   That's right.

14         Q.   Okay. And he talks about how that

15     investigation allowed the scientists at Reynolds to

16     identify many of the compounds that are in smoke,

17     right?

18         A.   Yes.

19         Q.   Okay. "During the past eight years an

20     intensive investigation in our laboratory on the

21      composition of cigarette smoke from various tobacco

22     types and blends has permitted identification of many

23     compounds and classes of compounds," right?

24         A.   Right.

25         Q.   All right. And then there are eight 3914

1      co-carcinogenic compounds that are identified there,

2     right? You want to take a look?

3         A.   Well, classes, I would say --

4         Q.   Okay.

5         A.   -- of compounds. Because we know -- identify

6     individual ones. On page 2, he says 43 poly cyclic

7     aromatic hydrocarbons, but he has five classes.

8         Q.   Five classes. All of these compounds that he

9     identified, including the co-carcinogenic ones, were

10     disclosed by the cigarette companies to the Surgeon

11      General in 1964, correct?

12         A.   The list of chemicals that they identified?

13     Yes, that was disclosed.

14         Q.   All right. Now, Reynolds published a number

15     of articles on the methods that Dr. Rodgman developed

16     to identify cigarette smoke constituents, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=694
17         A.   Yes, he did.

18         Q.   And one of the methods that Reynolds

19     published was on the use of 2,4,7-Trinitrofluorenone to

20     identify cigarette smoke components, right?

21          A.   Yes. Very good.

22         Q.   Did I say it right?

23         A.   Yes, pretty much.

24         Q.   Good. And the purpose of that method was to

25     identify the potentially harmful chemicals within 3915

1      cigarette smoke, right?

2         A.   That's right. It was a method, another one

3     of the method studies.

4         Q.   All right.

5              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

6              THE COURT: Yes.

7     BY MR. WALKER:

8         Q.   Dr. Cummings, I've just handed you an article

9     from the Journal of Analytical Chemistry; is that

10     right?

11          A.   Correct.

12         Q.   From August of 1963?

13         A.   Correct.

14         Q.   And now that I've pronounced that word once,

15     I'm not going to try it again. Would you read the

16     title?

17         A.   Titrimetric Analysis of

18     2,4,7-Trinitrofluorenone Complexes.

19         Q.   You're making me feel really good right now.

20         A.   Yeah. You're much better. Sorry.

21          Q.   All right. Well, what I've handed you, this

22     isn't some secret tobacco company document, is it?

23         A.   No. This isn't one of the secret documents.

24     This is a method study.

25         Q.   It's a publicly available article, right? 3916

1         A.   Sure. Analytical Chemistry is a

2     peer-reviewed publication.

3         Q.   And it's one of the premier journals in the

4     area of chemistry, right?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   Now, one of the ways to figure out what's in

7     cigarette smoke is to basically have a bunch of

8     cigarettes smoked, put them in a giant glass tube and

9     then shine lights on it, right? I know that doesn't

10     sound very sophisticated, but that's --

11          A.   That's chromatography.

12         Q.   Chromatography. Another way to do it is to

13     mix in compounds like this Trinitrofluorenone with

14     something, and then when they bind, you can tell what

15     the component is, right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   So this that I've handed you, this was

18     written by--

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=695
19              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, may I display this?

20              THE COURT: Lay a predicate, please.

21      BY MR. WALKER:

22         Q.   All right. Is this one of the documents --

23     this is -- this Journal of Analytical Chemistry and

24     this article in particular, that's certainly part of

25     the body of scientific literature that you referred to 3917

1      earlier as in forming your opinions, right?

2         A.   Like the others, yes.

3         Q.   You've seen this document before, right?

4         A.   Yes. Dr. Cundiff is the author.

5         Q.   All right.

6              MR. WALKER: May I display this document,

7         Your Honor?

8              THE COURT: Yes.

9     BY MR. WALKER:

10         Q.   All right. So there's the title there in all

11      its glory. And you've already said that this is

12     written by Robert Cundiff. And, also, is it a P.C. --

13     what is it, Markunas?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   They're both from Reynolds R and D, right?

16         A.   Yes. Looks like a letter. Because it's only

17     less than a page.

18         Q.   The way it's set up, okay.

19         A.   Yeah.

20         Q.   Now, you would agree with me that one of the

21     problematic substances in cigarette smoke is poly cyclic

22     aromatic hydrocarbons, right?

23         A.   Sure. That's the classic chemicals.

24         Q.   You talked about that in your direct

25     examination, right? 3918

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   All right. Now, here in this article that

3     we're looking at in the Journal of Analytical

4     Chemistry, they're publishing a method that will help

5     identify poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, right?

6         A.   Yes.

7         Q.   And they discuss this method and how useful

8     it is, right?

9         A.   They just present the method, essentially.

10         Q.   They identify some of the materials that bind

11      with 2,4,7-Trinitrofluorenone, right?

12         A.   Correct.

13              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, Your Honor, to some

14         writing in the document; meaning and intent. The

15         document speaks for itself.

16              THE COURT: Overruled, at this point.

17     BY MR. WALKER:

18         Q.   And some of those examples we can see on

19     Table 1, right? For example, Anthracene, Benzopyrene,

20     fluoranthene, and dibenz[a,h]anthracene; those are all

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=696
21      on there, right?

22         A.   They're all on there. They're not all

23     polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, however.

24         Q.   Right. These are some of the materials that

25     bind with 2,4,7-Trinitrofluorenone, right? 3919

1         A.   That's what they're testing here and

2     presenting the method.

3         Q.   So this paper offers a method for -- to

4     identify polycyclics in cigarette smoke?

5         A.   Selective chemicals.

6         Q.   Now, they published a method that other

7     scientists could use to find maybe even more

8     problematic compounds in cigarette smoke, yes?

9         A.   I'm not sure what you're referring to.

10         Q.   What they have done with this article is to

11     publish on a method that other scientists could use to

12     analyze cigarette smoke, right?

13         A.   Sure.

14         Q.   And, again, this was publicly available for

15     the Surgeon General when the committee was drafting the

16      1964 Surgeon General's report, right?

17         A.   It does pre-date that report. I'm not sure

18     how available it was.

19         Q.   All right. Now, another thing, see, Doctor,

20     we're talking about Dr. Rodgman. In 1969, he

21      summarized his research in a speech to the American

22     Chemical Society, didn't he?

23         A.   He gave a speech. Yes. I'm not sure he

24     summarized his research. That's summarized in the

25     February 1964 report you've already shared. 3920

1          Q.   Well, his speech was about the research he

2     had been conducting on the composition of tobacco

3     smoke, right?

4         A.   On the chemicals only. Didn't really talk

5     about the other things that he summarized in the

6     February 1964 report.

7         Q.   I'm actually not asking you that question.

8     Try to stick with me.

9         A.   Okay.

10         Q.   My question is, was Dr. Rodgman discussing

11      and describing some of the results of the research that

12     he conducted on the composition of tobacco smoke?

13         A.   He gave a speech, and yes, he talked about

14     some of the chemistry work that he did at that meeting.

15         Q.   Now, the American Chemical Society, let's be

16     clear. That's -- you're not suggesting -- no one is

17     suggesting they were part of the 50-year cover-up,

18     right?

19         A.   No.

20         Q.   All right. You're not suggesting -- no one

21      is suggesting that the American Chemical Society was

22     conspiring with the tobacco companies?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=697
23         A.   No, sir.

24              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor?

25              THE COURT: You want to take a break? 3921

1              MR. UITERWYK: Please.

2              THE COURT: Counsel approach, please.

3              (At sidebar.)

4              THE COURT: How much more do you have?

5              MR. WALKER: I didn't know you were going to

6         ask. Can I just look?

7              THE COURT: Sure.

8              MR. UITERWYK: I have to go to the bathroom

9         before.

10              THE COURT: Can you wait a couple minutes?

11               MR. UITERWYK: Yeah, a couple minutes, yeah.

12              THE COURT: Okay.

13              MR. UITERWYK: I'm not that bad. I'm getting

14         old but not that old, Judge.

15              MR. WALKER: I would say between an hour and

16         a half and two hours, Your Honor.

17              THE COURT: Okay. Well, have you reached

18         any --1 would like to let the jury know now if

19         we're going to keep them late. I would like to,

20         if we can, finish his testimony tonight.

21               MR. UITERWYK: Can we go to the bathroom, and

22         I can discuss it during the break?

23              THE COURT: Well, okay.

24              MR. WALKER: You can discuss it any way you

25         want to, Mr. Uiterwyk. 3922

1              MR. UITERWYK: You know what I'm talking

2         about.

3              THE COURT: Yes. But I need an idea.

4              MR. UITERWYK: I know, but I just heard from

5         him an hour and a half.

6              MR. WALKER: One and a half to two.

7              MR. UITERWYK: An hour and a half to two.

8              THE COURT: About an hour, Mr. Pedrosa?

9              MR. PEDROSA: Mr. Walker did cover some of

10         what I was going to cover, so maybe down to 45.

11               MR. UITERWYK: We're talking about two to two

12         and a half hours.

13              THE COURT: Yeah, more or less.

14              MR. PEDROSA: Of course, I don't know.

15         That's why I'm not going to --1 don't know how

16         many transcripts I'm going to have to pull out.

17         It can get longer.

18              THE COURT: All right.

19              (Sidebar concluded.)

20              THE COURT: All right. We'll be in recess

21          until 3:15. Keep an open mind and do not discuss

22         the case. We'll be in recess. Thank you.

23              THE BAILIFF: All rise.

24              (Jury exited the courtroom at 2:59 p.m.)

25             MR. SEIDEN: Judge, I have a reference for

3923

1         the voir dire.

2              THE COURT: Thank you.

3              MR. SEIDEN: It's from the January 17th

4         afternoon proceeding. I believe it starts at page

5          1308.

6              MR. UITERWYK: What are you talking about?

7              THE COURT: The instructions that I gave at

8         voir dire.

9              MR. SEIDEN: It starts at 1308, Judge, bottom

10         right corner down there.

11               THE COURT: Got it.

12              MR. BIGGER: You gave through 1312?

13              MR. SEIDEN: Yes.

14              THE COURT: Yeah, I gave it all. Okay. I

15         was concerned that -- it was two pages and there

16         was a page in between them, and I thought uh-oh,

17         did I not give it all? But it appears, to me, I

18         gave it all. So thank you.

19              MR. BIGGER: While you have it in your hands,

20         you can just go ahead and give it again.

21               THE COURT: All right. We'll be in recess.

22         Thank you.

23              (Recess taken from 3:00 p.m. to 3:24 p.m.)

24              THE BAILIFF: All rise. Come to order.

25         Court's back in session. 3924

1              THE COURT: Be seated. What says the

2         plaintiff?

3              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, we're assuming

4         that they're going to finish by 5:30. I believe

5         that's what they've basically indicated. Provided

6         that they finish by 5:30, we'll finish by 6:30,

7         Your Honor. But if they go beyond that, then

8         that's beyond my control.

9              THE COURT: Well, I'm not sure that's a

10         totally accurate statement of what they said at

11          sidebar. Mr. Walker said --1 think he said two

12         to two and a half hours?

13              What's your best estimate?

14              MR. WALKER: Two to two and a half hours,

15         Your Honor.

16              THE COURT: Mr. Pedrosa said I think a

17         reasonable estimate would be total time, three to

18         three and a half hours.

19              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, then I'm going to

20         reserve the right to recall him. Because I can't

21          make him stay overnight.

22              THE COURT: All right. We'll just--I'm

23         going to tell the jury we're going to stay to

24         about 6:30. We'll see how far we get. And I

25         would like to conclude his testimony. I think 3925

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=699
1         that's the best course of action. And if we get

2         to that point and we're not finished, you'll have

3         to make a decision.

4              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I need to say

5         something for the record, if I might, please.

6              THE COURT: Certainly.

7              MR. UITERWYK: The problem is we know what's

8         going to happen if he doesn't go to Fort Myers and

9         that's somebody will have to rest and their

10         case -- they will -- it will be gutting their

11          case.

12              THE COURT: Well, you need to get a mistrial

13         in that case or in this case.

14              MR. UITERWYK: I understand what you're

15         saying. But what I'm saying is I'm not saying

16         take him out of turn in the defendant's case. If

17         he can't come back -- because he -- in federal

18         court, they have a limited certain amount of time.

19              THE COURT: I know. They have hours.

20              MR. UITERWYK: Correct.

21               THE COURT: Usually they tell you, you have

22         20-something hours to put on your case.

23              MR. UITERWYK: I think it may be 12.

24              THE COURT: Whatever.

25              MR. UITERWYK: So I'm not concerned that he's 3926

1          going to -- and if he does and if we rest before

2         he gets back, so be it. That's the risk we're

3         taking. And we're willing to accept that risk.

4         But if we can recall him still in our case in

5         chief with time to spare, because we're not

6         talking about -- and I'm not talking about taking

7         hours or hours with this witness. I'm not doing

8         that.

9              THE COURT: Okay. Well, I'm not going to do

10         that.

11               All right. Bring the jury back, please.

12              THE BAILIFF: All rise.

13              (Jury in at 3:27 p.m.)

14              THE COURT: All right. Thank you. Be

15         seated.

16              All right. Members of the jury, we have a

17         bit of a scheduling issue that I need to bring to

18         your attention. Try as we might, things don't go

19         according to exactly how we plan. But I haven't

20         said it in this case, but I say it in most every

21          case, that a trial is not like a play where

22         everybody has a certain part that is completely

23         rehearsed and come in and they know what to say at

24         what given time. It just isn't like that, as you

25         can tell. 3927

1               So Dr. Cummings has another commitment

2         tomorrow morning, and we would like to complete

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=700
3         his testimony tonight -- today. In order to do

4         that, it may be necessary --it probably will be

5         necessary to stay later, to approximately --1

6         can't give you an exact time -- about 6:30.

7              Is that going to create a problem for any of

8         you? Please be honest.

9              JUROR HOUMAN: Can I make a phone call?

10              THE COURT: Certainly. That's why I'm

11          telling you now.

12              Anybody else need to make a call?

13              JUROR SMITH: I do.

14              THE COURT: Ms. Burrell?

15              JUROR BURRELL: I think 60 closes at

16         six o'clock.

17              MR. TRENTALANGE: State Road 60, Your Honor,

18         she's talking about.

19              THE COURT: Oh, State Road 60?

20              MR. TRENTALANGE: Yeah. There's a detour

21          that goes into effect, I think, at a certain time.

22              THE COURT: Oh, I see. You live in Brandon

23         or Valrico?

24              JUROR BURRELL: Yeah.

25              THE COURT: And you take that? 3928

1              JUROR BURRELL: I'm not familiar with the

2         roads.

3              THE COURT: All right. Are you talking about

4         the Lee Roy Selmon where they change -- where it's

5         one way at a certain time and another way -- and

6         they reverse that?

7              JUROR BURRELL: No. No.

8              THE COURT: You're talking about State Road

9         60?

10              JUROR BURRELL: Yeah.

11               MR. TRENTALANGE: State Road 60, Adamo Drive.

12              THE COURT: Is closed?

13              MR. TRENTALANGE: Well, they detour you

14         through Ybor City. And then it comes back around.

15         I'm not sure where.

16              THE COURT: But are you familiar with -- is

17         it closed 24 hours a day?

18              MR. TRENTALANGE: No, sir. The detour goes

19         into effect and it just makes it a little bit more

20         difficult to get out.

21               THE COURT: After 6:00, you think?

22              MR. TRENTALANGE: It's after dark sometime.

23              THE COURT: Okay. I see. Well, does that

24         present a difficult problem for you? Do you think

25         you could overcome that? 3929

1              JUROR BURRELL: Well, because I don't know

2         the area --

3              THE COURT: I see.

4              JUROR BURRELL: Yeah. So I don't - I just

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=701
5         thought --

6              THE COURT: Was that detour in effect when we

7         stayed late in jury selection?

8              JUROR BURRELL: (Indicates affirmatively.)

9              THE COURT: Were you able to -- because we

10         stayed that night until close to nine o'clock.

11               JUROR BURRELL: Yeah. I saw the guys that

12         was closing the road. So they took me on some

13         back road and put me back on 60 that night.

14              THE COURT: So somebody actually helped you?

15              JUROR BURRELL: Yeah.

16              THE COURT: Okay. All right. Anybody else

17         have any issues?

18              All right. Don't make your calls yet. I

19         need to discuss this issue with counsel again. So

20         I appreciate your indulgence. We'll just give you

21          a five-minute recess.

22              THE BAILIFF: All rise.

23              (Jury exited the courtroom at 3:31 p.m.)

24              THE COURT: I was going to ask the deputy to

25         find out whether or not State Road 60 is a state 3930

1          or county road, but I think I answered my own

2         question.

3              All right. I think we need to do the best

4         job we can to see if we can -- well, let me ask --

5         what's the plaintiffs position in asking me to

6         ask Ms. Burrell to stay later beyond 6:00?

7              MR. UITERWYK: The problem is, Your Honor --

8         I think even Mr. Pedrosa said it and I believe

9         Mr. Walker said it the other day -- when I'm the

10         last person and people are looking at their

11          watches and people want to get out of here, I'm

12         the plaintiff --1 mean, be it -- whether it's the

13         defendant or either one of the defendants or me,

14         it's whoever is there that's causing the lateness

15         is the one who's blamed.

16              THE COURT: Did any of you see the movie

17         Argo?

18              MR. SEIDEN: Yes, sir.

19              THE COURT: Well --

20              MR. TRENTALANGE: I saw Fargo and I liked it

21          very much.

22              THE COURT: Yeah. Fargo. This is --

23              MR. PEDROSA: Motion to strike as

24         nonresponsive.

25              THE COURT: It's about getting hostages out 3931

1         in 1979 and how they got them out. And there's a

2         line in there where they're debating this plan and

3         they say, This is the best of bad ideas. All the

4         ideas were bad, but this was the best one. So

5         that's what we have. We have a lot of bad ideas,

6         and you're going to have to pick the best one from

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=702
7         them because there's no easy one. And it's, you

8         know, you don't want to bring Mr. Cummings --

9         Dr. Cummings back, and you don't want to go beyond

10         5:30.

11               MR. UITERWYK: I think 6:00 -- fine with

12         that, Judge. I didn't hear -- the first time I

13         heard that we have a problem with one of the

14         jurors. Up till then, I was fine with 6:30. I

15         have no problem with 6:30.

16              THE COURT: Okay. So you're--in spite of

17         what Ms. Burrell said, you're okay with --

18              MR. UITERWYK: lam.

19              THE COURT: Okay. All right. Tell them that

20         we need to stay to 6:30 and for them to make the

21          necessary telephone calls. And we'll give them

22         another ten-minute recess.

23              THE BAILIFF: Yes, Judge.

24              MR. WALKER: Did you like the movie, Judge?

25              THE COURT: Yeah, it was a very good movie. 3932

1              MR. BROCK: It was excellent.

2              THE COURT: Yeah. I would recommend it. I

3         didn't know anything about that part of it.

4              All right. We'll be in recess another ten

5         minutes.

6              (Recess taken from 3:36 p.m. to 3:46 p.m.)

7              THE BAILIFF: All rise.

8              (Jury in at 3:46 p.m.)

9              THE COURT: All right. Thank you for your

10         patience.

11               Mr. Walker.

12              MR. WALKER: Thank you, Judge.

13     BY MR. WALKER:

14         Q.   Okay. Dr. Cummings, before we broke, we were

15     talking generally about Dr. Rodgman, right?

16         A.   Correct.

17         Q.   Then we were talking about Dr. Rodgman's

18     research at Reynolds and whether and how Dr. Rodgman's

19     work was shared with other scientists, right?

20         A.   Correct.

21          Q.   Okay. And what we started talking about was

22     a speech that Dr. Rodgman gave to the American Chemical

23     Society in 1969. Are you with me?

24         A.   Yes.

25         Q.   All right. What I would like to do is hand 3933

1     you a copy of that.

2              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

3              THE COURT: Yes.

4              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

5     BY MR. WALKER:

6         Q.   Sure. Okay. So we were kind of talking

7     earlier about what you remembered from Dr. Rodgman's

8     speech and I was asking you some questions about it.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=703
9     I've now just handed you a copy of the speech, and

10     that's something that you've seen before, right?

11          A.   It is.

12         Q.   All right. That's part of the broader

13     collection of documents, internal and public documents,

14     that you've reviewed and that have influenced your

15     opinions, right?

16         A.   Yes, I've reviewed this before.

17         Q.   All right.

18              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, at this time, I

19         would like to display Dr. Rodgman's speech on the

20         composition of cigarette smoke.

21               MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

22              THE COURT: All right.

23     BY MR. WALKER:

24         Q.   So this is the document. At the top there,

25     you see the title, The composition of cigarette smoke, 3934

1     Alan Rodgman, and he, of course, is with R.J. Reynolds

2     Tobacco Company. Do you see that?

3         A.   Yes.

4         Q.   Okay. And then a little bit down below

5     there, Dr. Rodgman says, "This evening I would like to

6     describe to you some of the results of research

7     conducted on the composition of tobacco smoke." Right?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   Okay. And if we could turn to the second

10     page, Dr. Rodgman said, "During the past two decades,

11      the number of identified components in tobacco smoke

12     has increased at a tremendous rate because of the

13     efforts of research personnel both within and outside

14     of the tobacco industry."

15              Did I read that right?

16         A.   Yes.

17         Q.   Okay. And then maybe we can do this a little

18     quickly. You've seen this document. He goes through

19     hydrocarbons and phenols and amines and aldehydes,

20     ketones, carbon -- there's a number of different

21      constituents of smoke; is that right?

22         A.   Correct.

23         Q.   Okay. And could we just zoom in there on the

24     highlighted part?

25              So those are a number of the different 3935

1     hydrocarbons listed there, right?

2         A.   Correct.

3         Q.   And then down below?

4              There we see that he was talking about

5     aldehydes, ketones, and something else there, right?

6         A.   Correct.

7         Q.   Okay. Now, let's move forward to page 31.

8     Well, it's the 31st page, I should say.

9              MR. UITERWYK: Bates stamped 31?

10              MR. WALKER: Slide 1688.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=704
11               MR. UITERWYK: Ninety-eight?

12              MR. WALKER: Eighty-eight.

13              THE WITNESS: Okay.

14     BY MR. WALKER:

15         Q.   He talks about nitrosamines, also, right?

16         A.   Yes.

17         Q.   Those are seven or eight different

18     nitrosamines he's got listed?

19         A.   Seven.

20         Q.   Seven. Okay. And all of those are

21      cancer-causing compounds, correct?

22         A.   Tobacco-specific nitrosamines, several of

23     them are. I'm not sure if that's all.

24         Q.   Okay. And in this public speech he was

25     giving, he even drew pictures of the chemical 3936

1      structures of some of the compounds, right?

2         A.   He did.

3         Q.   That was back more towards the beginning,

4     that's the 12th page, Bates, looks like 69.

5         A.   Correct.

6         Q.   You see that?

7         A.   Yes.

8         Q.   Okay. All right. Let's move on to another

9     one of Dr. Rodgman's reports.

10              MR. WALKER: May I approach?

11               THE COURT: Yes.

12              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

13     BY MR. WALKER:

14         Q.   Sure. All right. This is another one of

15     Dr. Rodgman's memos. And this one, I believe, is

16     already in evidence. Do you remember going through

17     portions of this with the jury?

18         A.   Yes, I do.

19         Q.   This is Dr. Rodgman's analysis of cigarette

20     smoke condensate, from September of 1956, right?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   Now, this document contains a lengthy

23     bibliography, right?

24         A.   It does.

25         Q.   That's similar to the bibliography that we 3937

1      saw in Dr. Teague's 1953 review, right?

2         A.   Correct.

3         Q.   Bibliography, and then a list of different

4     sources, right?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   Dr. Rodgman's bibliography contains cites to

7      121 different documents, right?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   And that includes some articles published in

10     a number of scientific journals, right?

11          A.   It does.

12         Q.   Like -- and I won't try to go through and

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=705
13     point all of these out unless you disagree with me, but

14     it includes cites to the Journal of the American

15     Medical Association, right?

16         A.   Yes.

17         Q.   Cancer Research. That's another journal

18     listed, right?

19         A.   Yes.

20         Q.   The Journal of Cancer, that's one that shows

21      up, right?

22         A.   Yes.

23         Q.   The Journal of the National Cancer Institute,

24     right? Number 95 on his list?

25         A.   Yes. 3938

1          Q.   Okay. Then if we turn to page 36 of this

2     document.

3         A.   Okay.

4         Q.   All right. If we could just zoom in at the

5     top there. This is under, Discussion.  "The current

6     controversy concerning the influence of cigarette

7     smoking on the increasing incidence of cancer of the

8     lung, and then in the human" -- what is that word? Oh,

9     male. And then there are a number of numbers there,

10     "has not yet been settled," right?

11          A.   Correct.

12         Q.   All right. And then one of the polycyclic

13     aromatic hydrocarbons referenced is this document is

14     something called benzo[a]pyrene, right?

15         A.   That's right.

16         Q.   If I refer to that as BAP, you'll know what

17     I'm talking about, right?

18         A.   I will.

19         Q.   It was no secret by this time that cigarette

20     smoke contained polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and

21      BAP, was it?

22         A.   By 1956, no, it was no secret.

23         Q.   Dr. Rodgman, if we look at page 40, the same

24     document.

25         A.   Okay. 3939

1          Q.   Zoom in on that.

2              That's -- he has a list of recommendations,

3     right?

4         A.   That's right.

5         Q.   And right there at the beginning, "It is

6     recommended that investigations of the reduction of the

7     content of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in

8     cigarette smoke be initiated," right?

9         A.   Yes.

10         Q.   In fact, Reynolds did do work on that issue

11      over time, right?

12         A.   Yes, they actually described some of the

13     investigations throughout.

14         Q.   All right. Let's go to another Rodgman

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=706
15     document.

16              MR. WALKER: May I approach with this one,

17         Your Honor?

18              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

19     BY MR. WALKER:

20         Q.   Sure. So now, this is another Rodgman

21      document that's from 1959, right?

22         A.   Yes.

23         Q.   This is one that's in evidence and you've

24     discussed it with Mr. Uiterwyk, right?

25         A.   Yes. 3940

1          Q.   Okay.

2              MR. WALKER: Can we display this?

3     BY MR. WALKER:

4         Q.   All right. Now, let's go into the very first

5     sentence there. In 1954 -- "Historical, in 1954, the

6     first report of the presence of a carcinogenic,

7     parentheses, cancer producing, end parentheses,

8     poly cyclic hydrocarbon 3,4-benzpyrene in cigarette

9     smoke was published."

10              Do you see that?

11          A.   Yes.

12         Q.   That had been published by Cooper, Lindsey

13     and Waller, right?

14         A.   That's right.

15         Q.   So that wasn't a secret known only to

16     Reynolds, was it?

17         A.   No.

18         Q.   Then if we could go on to the next portion

19     there. "Eight of the polycyclic hydrocarbons isolated

20     from the smoke are known to produce cancer in mice.

21      Another five or six are suspect as cancer-producing

22     agents in laboratory animals." Then he says, "There is

23     no evidence that any of these compounds will produce

24     cancer in man."

25              Did I read that correctly? 3941

1         A.   You did.

2         Q.   Okay. Now, by the way, this information

3     about polycyclic hydrocarbons, that information that

4     shows up in Dr. Rodgman's 1959 report was also being

5     published in Reader's Digest that same year, wasn't it?

6         A.   Not from this report. But there is the fact

7     that there had been eight polycyclics, yes. That's

8     referenced in Reader's Digest because that was in the

9     public literature.

10         Q.   Let's take a look at that.

11               MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

12              THE COURT: Yes.

13              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

14     BY MR. WALKER:

15         Q.   Sure. Now, the Reader's Digest article I

16     just handed you, that's what you -- or at least one of

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=707
17     the Reader's Digest articles that you had in mind when

18     you answered my question just a moment ago, right?

19         A.   Yes. I think you were going to ask me about

20     this.

21          Q.   Right. This is Reader's Digest from November

22      1959, right?

23         A.   Correct.

24         Q.   And the article is entitled The search for,

25     quote, safer, end quote, cigarettes? 3942

1         A.   Correct.

2         Q.   This is another one of those articles,

3     publications or documents that's part of a larger body

4     of documents that you've reviewed and have influenced

5     your opinions, right?

6         A.   I've seen this before.

7              MR. WALKER: Okay. May I display this, Your

8         Honor, Reader's Digest from 1959?

9              THE COURT: Any objection?

10              MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

11               THE COURT: All right.

12     BY MR. WALKER:

13         Q.   Okay. Reader's Digest, 1959. Let's move to

14     the article, please.

15              Now, by the way, this November 1959, is that

16     the same month that Dr. Rodgman wrote his memo to

17     Hoover that we just looked at?

18         A.   Yes, it is.

19         Q.   All right, now, I think you agreed with me

20     earlier that in the 1950s, Reader's Digest had the

21      highest circulation of any magazine in the United

22     States, right?

23         A.   It did.

24         Q.   Okay. So looking at page 44, it looks like

25     they brought it up for me. If we could zoom up there. 3943

1      "The Coming Chemistry. Scientists are convinced that

2     the primary carcinogens are higher poly cyclic

3     hydrocarbons formed by the combustion of tobacco at

4     high temperature, about 880 degrees centigrade in the

5     cigarette ember. They have identified eight

6     carcinogenic polycyclics in tobacco smoke and are on

7     the trail of others."

8              Did I read that correctly?

9         A.   That's right.

10         Q.   Okay. Let's go back to Dr. Rodgman's 1959

11      article. Let's take a look at the second page.

12         A.   Okay.

13         Q.   The second page. "Our previous efforts to

14     control smoke composition. Having confirmed and

15     extended the early published findings on poly cyclic

16     hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke, we initiated a lengthy

17     research program to develop methods to lessen the

18     amounts of these potentially dangerous compounds in

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=708
19     cigarette smoke."

20              Did I read that correctly?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   And, in fact, Reynolds did embark on a

23     lengthy effort to reduce polycyclic aromatic

24     hydrocarbons in cigarette smoke, correct?

25         A.   Yes. They're talking about the optimum 3944

1      composition here in this memo.

2         Q.   In fact, part of Dr. Rodgman's work at

3     Reynolds was to extract or pull out some of these

4     polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or carcinogens from

5     cigarette smoke, right?

6         A.   Well, that was the goal, but --

7         Q.   That was part of his work, right?

8         A.   That was the goal of the research program

9     that he led.

10         Q.   In fact, Dr. Rodgman has patents that were

11      awarded to him for reducing some of those

12     carcinogenics, correct?

13         A.   Yes. I'm familiar with his Hexane patent

14     which was not utilized.

15         Q.   Dr. Rodgman could not reduce the polycyclic

16     aromatic hydrocarbons to zero, could he?

17         A.   No, he could not.

18         Q.   And on page -- let's see, page 3 of the

19     document, in the footnote?

20              MR. UITERWYK: If we could quote also the

21          language of that footnote referred to, please,

22         Your Honor?

23              MR. WALKER: I haven't asked the question

24         yet.

25     BY MR. WALKER: 3945

1          Q.   The question for right now is, Footnote 3 is

2     what you already showed the jury about this issue,

3     right?

4         A.   Yes.

5         Q.   And that's because when you burn tobacco at

6     700 degrees Farenheit or higher, you generate those

7     types of chemicals, right?

8         A.   That's right.

9         Q.   You would agree that the work that

10     Dr. Rodgman was trying to do was, in fact, very

11      difficult work, right?

12         A.   Yes.

13         Q.   All right. And that's partly because

14     sometimes when you remove one class of carcinogens from

15     tobacco smoke, the changes that you make to do that can

16     actually cause a different class of carcinogens to

17     arise, right?

18         A.   That's a different problem, but, yes, that's

19     true.

20         Q.   Okay. Now, let's see, if we go back to page

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=709
21      2. Dr. Rodgman notes, "The experimental variations in

22     these investigations were such that over 120 separate

23     experiments were conducted involving almost one-half a

24     million cigarettes."

25              Did I read that right? 3946

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   Okay. Now, the fact of the matter is,

3     Reynolds scientists actually had to invent the

4     technology to allow it to isolate these compounds,

5     right?

6         A.   Well, what compounds are you referring to?

7         Q.   Poly cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

8         A.   They contributed to the science on the

9     measurement of those compounds, but they were not the

10     only ones developing the technology for isolating them.

11          Q.   All right. Well, Reynolds created the gas

12     chromatograph to help discover the different

13     constituents in cigarette smoke, right?

14         A.   That was one of the methods.

15         Q.   That's something that didn't exist before

16     Reynolds scientists went to work on this problem?

17         A.   I believe that's -- I'm not sure if that's

18     true or not.

19         Q.   Okay. But you've been asked before whether

20     that technology existed before Reynolds scientists went

21      to work on it, right?

22         A.   That's right.

23         Q.   Okay. And you know that Reynolds later

24     invented the gas capillary columns to use in the gas

25     chromatograph, right? 3947

1         A.   It did.

2         Q.   You're aware that Reynolds scientists

3     discovered over half of the compounds that had been

4     found in cigarette smoke, right?

5         A.   Yes. 7,000 to date.

6         Q.   Now, you -- we've been talking about Reynolds

7     and two Reynolds scientists, Dr. Teague and

8     Dr. Rodgman, but you also showed the jury a number of

9     Philip Morris documents, right?

10         A.   Yes.

11          Q.   Some of them were internal Philip Morris

12     documents from one person at Philip Morris to another

13     person at Philip Morris, right?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   Okay. Well, let me ask you a couple of

16     questions about Philip Morris.

17              Philip Morris prepared a submission to the

18     Surgeon General's advisory committee, listing the

19     chemicals found in cigarette smoke, right?

20         A.   Yes.

21          Q.   That submission listed the constituents of

22     cigarette smoke, didn't it?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=710
23         A.   It did.

24         Q.   And it included in the listing benzene. That

25     was one, right? 3948

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   Benzo anthracene?

3         A.   Correct.

4         Q.   Benzo[a]pyrene, right?

5         A.   Correct.

6         Q.   Three butadiene?

7         A.   Correct.

8         Q.   Those were all carcinogens, right?

9         A.   Yes, they were.

10         Q.   And in 1964, the Surgeon General noted the

11     presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in

12     cigarette smoke, right?

13         A.   They did.

14         Q.   Let's look at another Rodgman document.

15              Give me just one moment, Dr. Cummings.

16              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

17              THE COURT: Yes.

18              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

19     BY MR. WALKER:

20         Q.   Sure. Okay. Now, what I've just handed you

21      is another Rodgman document you showed to the jury,

22     right?

23         A.   That's right.

24         Q.   This one is from 1962?

25         A.   Correct. 3949

1          Q.   And the title is, The smoking and health

2     problem, a critical and objective appraisal, right?

3         A.   That's right.

4         Q.   Now, by the way, this document is a draft,

5     right?

6         A.   It appears to be.

7         Q.   Okay. Did you ever find a final version of

8     this document?

9         A.   No. I've seen different versions of it, but

10     they all appeared to be drafts.

11          Q.   Dr. Rodgman surveyed--

12              MR. WALKER: Can we pull up the document?

13     BY MR. WALKER:

14         Q.   Dr. Rodgman surveyed a number of articles

15     that appeared in medical and scientific journals in

16     this paper, right?

17         A.   Right.

18         Q.   And this is another one where he had a

19     bibliography, right?

20         A.   121 citations.

21          Q.   121 citations in this one?

22         A.   Right. Including internal records.

23         Q.   Now, you read to the jury a portion of this

24     document where Dr. Rodgman wrote, "Obviously the amount

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=711
25     of evidence accumulated to indict cigarette smoke" --3950

1      do you know what I'm talking about?

2         A.   Yes.

3         Q.    "as a health hazard is overwhelming. The

4     evidence challenging this indictment is scant." That's

5     what you read to the jury, right?

6         A.   That's right.

7         Q.   Let's pull that up, please. I think it's on

8     the fourth -- seventh page?

9         A.   Page 7.

10         Q.   Thank you.

11               All right. So the part you showed the jury

12     is the part that is not highlighted on here, right?

13     It's the first what, two sentences?

14         A.   I think the only thing we showed was the

15     first two sentences, but I have no problem with reading

16     the rest of the page.

17         Q.   And above that it says the evidence to date,

18     right?

19         A.   That's right.

20         Q.   Okay. I'm going to read the rest of it and

21      you tell me if I get any part of this wrong, okay?

22         A.   Okay. This isn't the rest of the page, but

23     okay.

24         Q.   Okay. However -- that's the rest of the

25     paragraph, right? 3951

1         A.   Yeah, but it references the final paragraph

2     which is important.

3         Q.   However -- so I'm going to start where you

4     started.

5         A.   Sure.

6         Q.   And then I'll just go all the way through.

7     "Obviously, the amount of evidence accumulated to

8     indict cigarette smoke as a health hazard is

9     overwhelming. The evidence challenging such an

10     indictment is scant.

11               "However, the evidence from epidemiological,

12     pathological, biological, and chemical studies

13     supporting the proposition that lung cancer is caused

14     by or associated with cigarette smoke is paralleled by

15     similar evidence supporting the proposition that lung

16     cancer is caused by or associated with air pollutants.

17               "In some instances, the evidence seems to be

18     stronger in support of cigarette smoke as a causative

19     or associated factor. In other instances, the evidence

20     seems to be stronger in support of air pollutants as a

21      causative or associated factor."

22              Did I read that correctly?

23         A.   As far as you've gone, yes.

24         Q.   Okay. Now, I want to switch topics. We've

25     been talking about Dr. Teague and Dr. Rodgman. You 3952

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=712

also gave some testimony and some opinions on the subject of addiction, right? A.   Yes.

I want to turn to you and ask you about that

Q

now A Q

Okay.

First of all, I just want to go back to your background, quickly.

There are a number of different branches of science, right?

A.   There are.

Q.   One branch is chemistry, right?

A.   That's right.

Q.   You don't have a degree in chemistry?

A.   No.

Q.   All right. Another branch is biology, right?

A.   Right.

Q.   You don't have a degree in biology?

A.   No.

Q.   Same is true for toxicology. You don't have a degree in toxicology, do you?

A.   No, I don't.

Q.   Now, pharmacology, that's the branch of science that studies the effect of drugs on the human body, right?

9

10

11

12

13

14

15

16

18

19

20

21

22

23

24

25

3954

1     you?

2         A.

A.   Right.

Q.   Okay. And when you talked to the jury about how nicotine affects the brain, you're not really doing that as a pharmacologist because you're not a pharmacologist, are you?

A.   I'm not a pharmacologist, that's correct.

Q.   And when you tell the jury an individual is addicted, you're not calling that a diagnosis, are you?

A.   I'm not a medical doctor so I don't make medical diagnoses. I do assessments of the addiction.

Q.   If someone comes to you who wants to quit smoking -- somebody comes to you who wants to quit smoking, and they want to use Chantix or Zyban or any other prescription aids that you've showed, that's not something that you can prescribe, is it?

A.   No. I'm not a medical doctor, so I don't prescribe medicine.

Q.   Okay. You're also not a psychiatrist, are you?

A.   No, I'm not a medical doctor, so I'm not a psychiatrist.

Q.   Psychologists are not medical doctors typically, are they?

A.   No.

And you're not a psychologist either, are

Q.

I have a degree in health behavior, but I'm

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=713
3     not a clinical psychologist, if that's what you're

4     referring to, which requires licensing.

5         Q.   I'm just asking if you're a psychologist.

6     You're not a psychologist, are you?

7         A.   I'm not a clinical psychologist, no, I'm not.

8         Q.   Some people have board certifications in

9     addiction medicine, right?

10         A.   That's right. It's a branch of medicine.

11          Q.   But you don't have a board certification in

12     addiction medicine, do you?

13         A.   No, because I'm not a medical doctor.

14         Q.   Okay. And because you're not a medical

15     doctor, you're not board certified in any area of

16     medicine, are you?

17         A.   Correct.

18         Q.   Now, you talked about changes to nicotine

19     receptors in the brains of smokers during direct

20     examination, right?

21          A.   That's right.

22         Q.   But you would agree that there are other

23     people who are more qualified than you are when it

24     comes to the science of brain receptors, right?

25              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, Your Honor, asking 3955

1         him to comment about others.

2              THE COURT: Sustained.

3     BY MR. WALKER:

4         Q.   You know -- you've never done a study of the

5     receptors in people's brains, have you?

6         A.   No, that's not true. I've been working with

7     the neuro science folks at NUSC who are part of the

8     research program that I'm leading there.

9         Q.   Okay. And that's something you just started,

10     right?

11          A.   A year ago October.

12         Q.   Okay. Now, you have no clinical experience

13     when it comes to measuring receptor levels in the human

14     brain?

15         A.   No. My research would be research

16     experience.

17         Q.   Okay. Now, by the way, you testified that

18     you're familiar with autopsy studies showing the

19     effects of smoking on the brain?

20         A.   That's true.

21          Q.   Okay. But there was no autopsy in this case,

22     was there?

23         A.   No.

24         Q.   Okay.

25         A.   Not that I'm aware of. 3956

1          Q.   Now, I want to talk to you about addiction,

2     generally.

3              You would agree with me, would you not, that

4     there are many behaviors besides smoking that people

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=714
5     find very difficult to quit or to control, right?

6         A.   Sure.

7         Q.   Dieting would be one example?

8         A.   Well, dieting -- people -- a lot of people

9     have trouble controlling their diet.

10         Q.   Exercise?

11          A.   Sure.

12         Q.   Drinking coffee?

13         A.   Yes.

14         Q.   Okay. Some people have a hard time giving up

15     coffee, right?

16         A.   Some people do.

17         Q.   Coffee contains caffeine, right?

18         A.   That's right.

19         Q.   Caffeine is a drug?

20         A.   Yes, sir.

21          Q.   And you can become physically dependent on

22     caffeine, can't you?

23         A.   There is evidence to that, yes.

24         Q.   In fact, there are even caffeine receptors in

25     the brain; is that right? 3957

1         A.   I'm not an expert on caffeine receptors other

2     than being a consumer. And I don't know one way or the

3     other. There may be.

4         Q.   Well, you were asked this question just last

5     year, right, whether there are caffeine receptors in

6     the brain?

7         A.   I suspect I probably said yes, because I

8     believe there probably are.

9         Q.   Okay. Now, those caffeine receptors would

10     operate by the same process that you described for

11      nicotine receptors, right?

12         A.   I don't know.

13         Q.   Well, you knew last year when you were asked

14     this question, didn't you?

15         A.   I don't know what I answered last year. I'm

16     not really knowing what you're referring to.

17         Q.   Let me help you out. You testified in a case

18     called Denton, didn't you?

19         A.   I did.

20         Q.   That was just last year, wasn't it?

21          A.   Yes, it was.

22              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

23              THE COURT: Yes.

24     BY MR. WALKER:

25         Q.   All right. In the Denton case, you were 3958

1     testifying at trial, right?

2         A.   That's right.

3         Q.   And you were under oath then just as you are

4     now, right?

5         A.   Yes. Same as you've asked previously.

6         Q.   Not about Denton, I haven't.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=715
7              There was a court reporter there recording

8     all of your answers, right?

9         A.   Yes, sir.

10         Q.   Let's take a look at page 300, if you would,

11     please.

12         A.   Okay.

13         Q.   We'll start at line 2 and go through line 7.

14              MR. WALKER: Pull that up.

15              Okay.

16     BY MR. WALKER:

17         Q.   "Question: There are caffeine receptors in

18     the brain, aren't there?

19               "Answer: There are.

20              "Question: They operate by the same process

21      you described for nicotine receptors.

22              "Answer: Yeah."

23              Did I read that correctly?

24         A.   Yes. Referencing the prior answer, which

25     talked about dopamine release. 3959

1          Q.   Okay. Now, you've testified that at some

2     point, you believe that you were addicted to caffeine;

3     is that right?

4         A.   I have.

5         Q.   Okay. Now, eating chocolate is another

6     behavior that can be hard for some people to control,

7     right?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   You've testified the Internet can be hard for

10     people to control, right?

11          A.   There are some people that have trouble with

12     the Internet, yes.

13         Q.   You've seen studies that show that some

14     people are addicted to the Internet, right?

15         A.   I've seen studies, yes.

16         Q.   Video games?

17         A.   I've seen studies, yes.

18         Q.   BlackBerry's?

19         A.   Yes.

20         Q.   Some people call them crackberry's, don't

21      they?

22         A.   Some people do.

23         Q.   Let's see. Now, if you define addiction --

24     let me ask you hypothetically.

25              If you define addiction as simply being 3960

1      difficult to quit or difficult to control, you sweep in

2     a variety of different behaviors such as the ones I've

3     asked you about, right?

4         A.   Yes.

5         Q.   Okay.

6         A.   That's not the definition that I use.

7         Q.   By the way, chocolate also has two drugs in

8     it, right, theobromine and caffeine?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=716
9         A.   Yes, sir.

10         Q.   Now, you've testified that caffeine releases

11      dopamine when you drink it, right?

12         A.   Yes.

13         Q.   There are lots of things that cause release

14     of dopamine in the brain, right?

15         A.   Sure.

16         Q.   Alcohol triggers the release of dopamine?

17         A.   It can, yes.

18         Q.   If you eat a good meal, you can experience

19     the release of dopamine, right?

20         A.   Yes.

21          Q.   The truth is, any time you experience

22     something that you enjoy, something exciting, you're

23     going to experience the release of dopamine, right?

24         A.   Yes.

25         Q.   But you don't think that people eat chocolate 3961

1     because of caffeine or theobromine, do you?

2         A.   Most people are not addicted to chocolate or,

3     you know, football games where they get excited.

4         Q.   Those drugs are in those products, but there

5     are many reasons why people eat chocolate, right?

6         A.   What drugs are you referring to?

7         Q.   I'm referring to caffeine and theobromine.

8         A.   Sure.

9         Q.   Nevertheless, there are many reasons why

10     people eat chocolate, right?

11          A.   They're delivered orally. And so the

12     absorption and the speed by which the drug affects the

13     body is very different than inhaling those drugs and

14     getting it administered in a different way.

15         Q.   I haven't asked you anything about inhaling.

16     I'm just asking you, even though there is theobromine

17     in caffeine and chocolate, nevertheless, there are many

18     reasons apart from those why people eat chocolate.

19         A.   There are many reasons, yes. And one of them

20     has to do with drug administration, route of

21      administration.

22         Q.   You don't think people drink coffee just

23     because of the caffeine, do you?

24         A.   No.

25         Q.   There are many reasons why people drink 3962

1      coffee apart from the caffeine, right?

2         A.   Sure.

3         Q.   The same would be true for cigarettes. There

4     are many reasons that you've found in your research why

5     people smoke cigarettes when they come to your clinic,

6     correct?

7         A.   Well, there are a variety of reasons. But

8     there's a primary reason for the people that came to my

9     smoking clinics.

10         Q.   There are many reasons for people that come

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=717
11      to your smoking clinic why people smoke cigarettes.

12         A.   Sure.

13         Q.   Okay. I want to talk to you about your

14     addiction opinions.

15              The truth of the matter is, sir, that you

16     believe that anyone who smokes every day is addicted,

17     right?

18         A.   No. That's not entirely accurate. To

19     explain it, you know, it's persistent daily use, I

20     think is the criteria. So you're looking at a

21      compulsive use behavior. So everyday use is one of the

22     hallmarks that I look for over a persistent basis, but

23     smoking one time one day doesn't make you an addict.

24         Q.   Let me see if you can answer this one with a

25     yes or a no. 3963

1              You believe that anyone who is a daily

2     cigarette smoker is addicted; yes or no?

3         A.   Yes, so long as you've qualified it as

4     persistent daily use.

5         Q.   Well, that's a daily cigarette smoker, right?

6         A.   That's right.

7         Q.   Okay. So anyone who smokes every day is

8     addicted, according to you, right?

9         A.   Persistent daily use is one of the criteria

10     that I utilize in my assessments, yes.

11          Q.   Well, it's not just one of the criteria.

12     It's your bottom line, isn't it? Anyone who is a daily

13     cigarette smoker is addicted, right?

14         A.   Which question do you want me -- my bottom

15     line? No, that's not my bottom line.

16              But persistent daily use, yes, is one of the

17     criteria that I use.

18         Q.   All right. Do you remember giving testimony

19     in a case called Hancock?

20         A.   Yes.

21          Q.   That was just last year also, right?

22         A.   Yes, sir.

23         Q.   Okay. Let's look at what you said then about

24     this.

25         A.   Okay. 3964

1              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

2              THE COURT: Yes.

3     BY MR. WALKER:

4         Q.   I brought you two, but I think you only need

5     one.

6              All right. If you would -- so you gave

7     testimony at trial in this case called Hancock, right?

8         A.   I did.

9         Q.   Talking to another jury under oath with a

10     court reporter there, right?

11          A.   Yes.

12         Q.   Okay. This was just in August of last year,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=718
13     right?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   Take a look at page 1745, lines 12 -- oh, 12

16     through, let's see -- let's go 12 through 17.

17         A.   Okay.

18         Q.   All right?

19               "Question: Dr. Cummings, you believe that

20     anyone who is a daily cigarette smoker is addicted,

21      correct?

22              "Answer: Yes.

23               "You believe a daily cigarette smoker of one

24     cigarette per day is addicted.

25               "Answer: Persistent daily use, yes." 3965

1              That was your testimony, right?

2         A.   Yes, it was.

3         Q.   Okay. In fact, for the past 16 years that

4     you've been testifying in cases like this one, in every

5     single trial in which you've testified that involved an

6     individual smoker, every single time you testified that

7     the smoker was addicted to nicotine; is that right?

8         A.   Yes. I wouldn't bother to get involved in a

9     case otherwise.

10         Q.   Okay. Now, in this case, you formed your

11      opinion that Mrs. Loyd was addicted to nicotine over

12     three years ago, right?

13         A.   I did, based on the material that I had

14     reviewed at that time.

15         Q.   Well, that's what I want to ask you about.

16     The material that you reviewed at the time that you

17     decided that Ms. Evers was addicted was nothing more

18     than two depositions, in terms of depositions, right?

19         A.   Well, I reviewed two depositions and close to

20     a thousand pages of medical records.

21          Q.   The medical records, of course. But when you

22     told the jury about a dozen or more depositions that

23     you read, that was all -- most -- all but two of those

24     you reviewed after you had already decided she was

25     addicted, right? 3966

1              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, this has been

2         asked and answered. Yesterday asked and answered,

3         as a matter of fact.

4              THE COURT: I don't recall. Overruled.

5              THE WITNESS: I did ask -- answer that

6         question actually probably last week.

7     BY MR. WALKER:

8         Q.   That's what Mr. Uiterwyk was asking you. I'm

9     actually asking you whether at the time that you made

10     your opinion about Mrs. Loyd being addicted, you hadn't

11      read the dozen or so depositions you talked about; you

12     only read two and then the medical records, right?

13         A.   Correct. Plus the worksheets that had been

14     completed.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=719
15         Q.   And the two depositions that you read, one

16     was for Ellis Loyd, right?

17         A.   Correct.

18         Q.   And the other was for the plaintiff,

19     Cindy Evers, right?

20         A.   Right.

21          Q.   Okay. Now, at some point after that is when

22     you got these other depositions, right?

23         A.   That's right. I explained that yesterday, I

24     believe, to you.

25         Q.   All right. Now, what I want to do --1 want 3967

1     to take a look at -- I'm going to put on the ELMO --

2     you talked about a number of different tests or quizzes

3     or whatever you call it that you apply in giving your

4     opinion testimony, right?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And this was one of them, right, the

7     heaviness of smoking index, right?

8         A.   That's right.

9         Q.   Now, the heaviness of smoking index is really

10     just two questions, right?

11          A.   That's right.

12         Q.   How soon after you wake up do you smoke your

13     first cigarette, and, How many cigarettes per day do

14     you smoke, right?

15         A.   Correct.

16         Q.   All right. Now, first of all, surely you can

17     agree with me that the heaviness of smoking index is

18     used to determine the degree of addiction as opposed to

19     whether someone is addicted or not, right?

20         A.   Yes, I would agree with that.

21          Q.   In fact, the heaviness of smoking index

22     doesn't even have a category that says that a smoker is

23     not addicted, does it?

24         A.   No. It has the categories that are listed

25     below under scoring. 3968

1          Q.   And that means that if you score a zero on

2     the first question and score a zero on the second

3     question, you're still going to be scored as being low

4     dependence, right?

5         A.   On this scale, yes.

6         Q.   On this scale, okay.

7              Okay. So the first question is, How soon

8     after you wake up do you smoke your first cigarette,

9     right?

10         A.   That's right.

11          Q.   And you testified on direct that there was

12     evidence that she smoked first thing in the morning.

13         A.   That's right.

14         Q.   Okay. The truth is, the only evidence that

15     you've seen in this case that Mrs. Loyd smoked her

16     first cigarette in the morning is from Ron Cahill;

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=720
17     isn't that right?

18         A.   Mr. Cahill did say that. Also talked about

19     smoking first --in the middle of the night.

20         Q.   Not only did he say it, he's the only one in

21      this case that said that in the depositions that you

22     reviewed; isn't that right?

23         A.   True.

24         Q.   So Ron Cahill said that Mrs. Loyd smoked her

25     first cigarette of the day with coffee before taking a 3969

1      shower, right?

2         A.   That's right.

3         Q.   That's what you're relying on for your answer

4     to the first part of this test, true?

5         A.   True.

6         Q.   Now, let's talk about Ron Cahill. He's one

7     of Mrs. Loyd's ex-husbands, right?

8         A.   That's right.

9         Q.   He met and married Mrs. Loyd in 1988?

10         A.   Correct.

11          Q.   And their marriage only lasted about two

12     months; is that right?

13         A.   It was a short duration, yes.

14         Q.   Okay. And they didn't live together before

15     they got married, did they?

16         A.   I don't believe so.

17         Q.   And you know from the depositions that you

18     reviewed that you're relying on in applying this test

19     that Ron Cahill did not even know that Mrs. Loyd was a

20     smoker when they got married.

21          A.   I do.

22         Q.   Okay. And you know from your review of that

23     same deposition that he didn't find out that Mrs. Loyd

24     even smoked cigarettes until two or three weeks before

25     the end of their marriage; is that right? 3970

1         A.   I don't recall that. I do know that there

2     was a period when he didn't know that she was a smoker.

3         Q.   Okay. So you know that the period of time

4     that he did know was short, right?

5         A.   Well, it was a short marriage, yes.

6         Q.   Okay. So the period of time that he knew

7     that Mrs. Loyd smoked cigarettes, if I tell you that

8     was a two or three-week period out of their two-month

9     marriage in 1988, do you have any reason to disagree

10     with me?

11          A.I don't have any reason to disagree with you

12     or not disagree with you. I just don't know. I'm sure

13     it's in the transcript.

14         Q.   Okay. Well, you looked at the transcript in

15     order to score this heaviness of smoking index,

16     correct?

17         A.   I did. I looked for evidence across all of

18     them, and Mr. Cahill certainly indicated that his

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=721
19     former wife smoked, you know, first thing in the

20     morning. She also mentioned --he also mentioned she

21      smoked when she got up in the middle of the night.

22         Q.   Well, smoking when you got up in the middle

23     of the night isn't even a part of this test, is it?

24         A.   Well, it's like when you get up. You're

25     replenishing the nicotine levels. That's what the 3971

1      scale is about.

2         Q.   Actually, I'm not asking you what the scale

3     is about. I'm asking you if the heaviness of smoking

4     index asks whether you get up in the middle of the

5     night.

6         A.   No. It has, how soon after you wake up do

7     you smoke your first cigarette? So that could be in

8     the morning or it could be in the middle of the night.

9         Q.   So let's stick with the heaviness of smoking

10     index, because that's what we're talking about right

11      now, right?

12         A.   Sure.

13         Q.   Are you with me on this?

14         A.   I've been with you the whole time.

15         Q.   Okay. All right. Now -- so out of -- now,

16     Mrs. Loyd smoked cigarettes for what, 40 years?

17         A.   Yeah. About 42 years or so.

18         Q.   Okay. So out of the 40 years that Mrs. Loyd

19     smoked cigarettes, you only know when she smoked her

20     first cigarette of the day for a two-week period in

21      1988 from Mr. Cahill, right?

22         A.   No. I don't--1 mean, I'm just recalling

23     the testimony I reviewed. And I don't know about the

24     two-week period that you're characterizing. That would

25     be a misrepresentation. 3972

1              He was asked about, you know, her smoking

2     pattern, and he was asked about her smoking first thing

3     in the morning. And he answered, yes, she did.

4         Q.   So you're telling me that the two to

5     three-week period at the end of the marriage is a

6     misrepresentation of Ron Cahill's testimony?

7         A.   No. I said I didn't know about that one way

8     or the other.

9         Q.   Well, how long do you think it is? You

10     scored this. How long do you think it was that

11      Mr. Cahill had the opportunity to observe Mrs. Loyd as

12     a smoker?

13         A.   Well, the several months that they were

14     married. I mean, they were married several months.

15     And he was asked about her smoking pattern, and he

16     reported that -- in response to the question about her

17     smoking first thing in the morning, he said, yeah, she

18     smoked first thing in the morning.

19         Q.   Now, Dr. Cummings, we just discussed that you

20     saw in Ron Cahill's testimony that he didn't even know

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=722
21      she was a smoker for the better part of their marriage,

22     right?

23         A.   I don't know about the better part.

24         Q.   Well, when they got married.

25         A.   Yes, when they got married. 3973

1          Q.   Okay. So now you want to say that Ron Cahill

2     knew when she had her first cigarette for the whole

3     two-month marriage?

4         A.   No, I don't want to say anything. I'm just

5     reporting what I observed in the testimony. When the

6     question was asked as to whether she smoked first thing

7     in the morning, he responded yes.

8         Q.   So how long was it? How long --

9         A.   Within five minutes.

10         Q.   No, no. How long -- for what period of time

11      in Mrs. Loyd's 40-year smoking history did Ron Loyd's

12     testimony that she smoked -- about when she smoked her

13     first cigarette, how much time does that cover, his

14     testimony?

15              THE COURT: I think you misspoke. You said

16         Ron Loyd.

17     BY MR. WALKER:

18         Q.   Oh, boy. Ron Cahill.

19              MR. WALKER: Thank you, Judge.

20              THE WITNESS: Yeah. You know, I don't know

21          the actual days or weeks or months. They were

22         married a short period of time. I do know that.

23     BY MR. WALKER:

24         Q.   Let's say we give her the full two months,

25     right? We give Ron Cahill the full two months. He 3974

1      didn't know she was a smoker, but somehow he knew when

2     she had her first cigarette the entire two months.

3     Okay?

4         A.   Okay.

5         Q.   Let's assume that.

6         A.   All right.

7         Q.   So your answer to this question on the

8     heaviness of smoking index is based on a witness who

9     could only answer that question for two months out of

10     her 40-year smoking history; isn't that right?

11          A.   That would be true.

12         Q.   Okay. No witness testified about when

13     Mrs. Loyd had her first cigarette of the day in the

14      1950s, correct?

15         A.   True. I'm not sure they were asked.

16         Q.   No witness testified when Mrs. Loyd had her

17     first cigarette of the day in the 1960s.

18         A.   That's true.

19         Q.   No witness testified when Mrs. Loyd had her

20     first cigarette of the day in the 1970s.

21          A.   That's right.

22         Q.   And other than the time period that

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=723
23     Mr. Cahill knew her, no witness testified when she had

24     her first cigarette of the day in the 1980s either,

25     right? 3975

1         A.   Right. Mr. Cahill was the one who talked

2     about smoking first thing in the morning. He was the

3     only witness.

4         Q.   Okay.

5         A.   I agree.

6         Q.   All right. And by the way, you don't know

7     when she smoked her first cigarette of the day in the

8      1990s, do you?

9         A.   No.

10         Q.   Okay. So the only evidence to answer this

11      first question about how soon after you wake up do you

12     smoke your first cigarette is the brief time period in

13      1988 when Ron Cahill was married to Mrs. Loyd, right?

14         A.   No, sir. That's not the only evidence. I

15     have 33 years of dealing with smokers. And the pattern

16     of smoking and time to first cigarette is one that's

17     usually established in long term.

18              I've studied the reliability, in other words,

19     whether this changes among smokers, and it doesn't

20     change much, which is why it's a reliable predictor,

21      which is why it's used in this scale.

22         Q.   Right.

23              So basically what you've told me is that

24     Ron Cahill's testimony about a two-month period in 1988

25     is good enough for you, right? 3976

1         A.   He was asked the question. He answered it.

2     And I looked across all the depositions about whether

3     that question was asked. And he provided evidence.

4     And many times the question wasn't asked of the other

5     witnesses. So it couldn't have been asked.

6         Q.   So when a question is not asked, the question

7     is not answered either, right?

8         A.   That's true.

9         Q.   So that would tell me that for the 1950s, the

10      1960s, the 1970s, and the 1990s, there's total absence

11      of evidence from which the jury could use to answer

12     this first question for those decades, right?

13              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, argumentative,

14         Your Honor.

15              THE COURT: Overruled.

16              THE WITNESS: No. I mean, the evidence that

17         I just indicated is --

18     BY MR. WALKER:

19         Q.   Ron Cahill?

20         A.   No. I indicated through my experience

21      dealing with smokers and my assessment of this, it

22     doesn't vary with people. Once they establish that

23     pattern, it is the pattern that they typically follow.

24     It doesn't vary with regards to this question.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=724
25             I'll grant you that Mr. Cahill was the only

3977

1      one asked the question and who answered she smoked

2     first thing in the morning. Many other, you know,

3     people didn't know the pattern.

4         Q.   So Ron Cahill's testimony from a two-month

5     period in 1988 is good enough for you, and your

6     testimony is it should be good enough for the jury?

7         A.   Yes, sir.

8         Q.   Because you say so, right?

9         A.   Yes. Based on my 33 years of experience

10     dealing with thousands and thousands of smokers, yes,

11      sir.

12         Q.   Okay. Now, there is evidence beyond just a

13     two-month period in 1988 about how many cigarettes per

14     day she smoked, right? True or false?

15         A.   Yeah.

16         Q.   Okay. And that, by the way, gets back to

17     where we started with your original opinion that if

18     you're a daily smoker or persistent daily smoker --

19     however you want to say it -- then you're addicted,

20     right?

21          A.   Well, that's one of the criteria that I use.

22     It's not the only criteria.

23         Q.   Okay. Well, we talked about the first one,

24     right?

25         A.   That's right. 3978

1          Q.   I'm now asking you about the second one. The

2     second criteria is pretty much right back to where we

3     started with your testimony that if you're a persistent

4     daily smoker, you are addicted.

5         A.   No, sir. I mean, the amount smoked is the

6     measure of degree of dependence. Persistent daily use

7     is a compulsive use behavior measure.

8         Q.   All right. The question is, how many

9     cigarettes per day do you smoke, right?

10         A.   Yes. That's -

11          Q.   If you smoke one cigarette per day -- we

12     already looked at your testimony from Hancock -- you're

13     addicted, right?

14         A.   Well, that's one of the criteria, yes.

15         Q.   Okay. So any answer to this question other

16     than zero means addicted, in your view, right?

17         A.   If you're persistent, you do it over a

18     persistent daily basis, yes, which I say for at least

19     three months.

20         Q.   Okay. All right. You also talked about this

21      Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence. It's a little

22     hard to read. This is the copy I was given. It's the

23     only one I have.

24              Can you read that?

25         A.   Sure. 3979

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=725
1          Q.   And you talked about this with Mr. Uiterwyk,

2     right?

3         A.   That's correct.

4         Q.   All right. So the first question is, How

5     soon after you wake do you smoke your first cigarette,

6     right?

7         A.   Correct.

8         Q.   Pretty much the same thing we just got

9     through talking about. And you've scored this question

10     based on Ron Cahill's testimony, right?

11          A.I scored the entire scale based on all the

12     testimony I reviewed.

13         Q.   Yeah. I'm just asking you about the first

14     question now.

15         A.   Yes.

16         Q.   How soon after --

17         A.   He's the one that indicated smoked first

18     thing in the morning.

19         Q.   He's not just--he's the only one that

20     indicated that, right?

21          A.   That's right. That's what I said.

22         Q.   So just as on the heaviness of smoking index,

23     the Fagerstrom test, the way you scored it, you

24     answered that first question just based on the

25     two-month period from 1988 that Ron Cahill testified 3980

1      about, and then you've said that that's good enough for

2     you to know that that information applies to all the

3     other time periods.

4         A.   Yes, sir.

5         Q.   Okay. So we talked about that one.

6              All right. Question 2, Do you find it

7     difficult to refrain from smoking in places where it's

8     forbidden, right?

9         A.   That's right.

10         Q.   And you actually mentioned this prong of the

11      test or other factors that you've looked at in other

12     tests relating to this, right?

13         A.   That's right.

14         Q.   And did you tell this jury that it was hard

15     for Mrs. Loyd to go a couple of hours without smoking?

16         A.   What I said -- yes. There was testimony that

17     she found it hard to go more than two to three hours

18     without smoking. There was also testimony that she

19     would get up from restaurants to smoke.

20         Q.   I'm not asking you about restaurants right

21      now. I just want to confirm that your testimony, your

22     opinion based on everything that you reviewed, was that

23     Mrs. Loyd had a hard time going a couple of hours

24     without smoking.

25         A.   Yes, there was testimony. Two to three 3981

1     hours.

2         Q.   Did you also testify that her smoking

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=726
3     controlled her?

4         A.   No.

5         Q.   Okay. You don't remember showing that a

6     score of seven on --1 don't know if it was this test

7     or another test -- and Mr. Uiterwyk pulled up at the

8     bottom where it said that if you score a seven, that

9     means watch out, your smoking controls you, you don't

10     control your smoking? You don't remember giving that

11      testimony?

12         A.   I remember the scoring scheme. And, yeah, a

13     seven on the Fagerstrom scale would be a high level of

14     dependence. It's another one of these scales that's

15     measuring degree of dependence.

16         Q.   So what's your bottom line? Did

17     Jacqueline Loyd control her smoking, or did

18     Jacqueline Loyd's smoking control her?

19         A.   I scored her based on the items as we went

20     through this in front of the jury several days ago.

21      Some of the items couldn't be scaled -- or scored

22     because she wasn't available to answer the questions

23     and there was really no evidence one way or the other.

24     I don't think many of the family members who were

25     deposed were even asked these questions about her 3982

1      smoking pattern or would have firsthand knowledge about

2     it. But of the ones I scored, she scored a seven.

3         Q.   So what's the bottom line? Did

4     Jacqueline Loyd control her smoking, or did

5     Jacqueline Loyd's smoking control her?

6         A.   My bottom line was that I would score her,

7     you know, a five or six on the heaviness of smoking

8     index, which puts her in the high dependent category.

9     A seven was also categorized as a high dependent.

10              So, yeah, I mean, she -- her behavior was

11      constrained because of her addiction to nicotine, in my

12     opinion.

13         Q.   Let me try again.

14         A.   That was the bottom line that I gave.

15         Q.   Third time is a charm, hopefully.

16              Did Jacqueline Loyd --

17              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, move to strike

18         counsel's comment.

19              THE COURT: Overruled.

20     BY MR. WALKER:

21          Q.   Did Jacqueline Loyd control her smoking, or

22     did Jacqueline Loyd's smoking control her?

23         A.   Her smoking controlled some of her behavior,

24     yes.

25         Q.   All right. Let's talk about that. 3983

1         A.   Sure.

2         Q.   Now, you didn't review it back in 2009, but

3     you did say that you have since reviewed another dozen

4     or so depositions, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=727
5         A.   I did testify to that several times so far.

6         Q.   Okay. I want to ask you about what you saw

7     in those and your opinion that she couldn't go for a

8     couple of hours without smoking and that her smoking

9     controlled her, okay?

10         A.   Okay.

11          Q.   All right. You know from your review of the

12     depositions that Mrs. Loyd did not smoke at 4H events,

13     right?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   She didn't smoke during 4H meetings either,

16     right?

17         A.   Correct.

18         Q.   She didn't take smoke breaks during 4H

19     meetings, did she?

20         A.   I recall that testimony, yes.

21          Q.   She couldn't smoke when she was riding

22     horses, could she?

23         A.   No.

24         Q.   She couldn't smoke when she was training

25     horses, could she? 3984

1         A.   True.

2         Q.   She didn't smoke during church services, did

3     she?

4         A.   Not in church. When she left.

5         Q.   When she -- she didn't have problems going to

6     restaurants or stores where smoking was prohibited, did

7     she?

8         A.   She would leave the restaurant to smoke, is

9     what I recall from the testimony.

10         Q.   Okay. Who said that?

11          A.I believe there were two family members who

12     mentioned that. Mr. Cahill mentioned it, and

13     Doug Norris.

14         Q.   Okay. So we're back to Ron Cahill, right?

15         A.   Actually, Doug Norris.

16         Q.   Who is Doug Norris?

17         A.   Amber's husband.

18         Q.   Okay. She didn't smoke when she went on long

19     bike rides, did she?

20         A.   I don't recall the bike rides.

21          Q.   You don't recall -- that was in Ron Cahill's

22     deposition. You didn't see where he testified that

23     they would go on long bike rides and she didn't smoke?

24         A.   I'm just not recalling it. I'm sorry.

25         Q.   Is it in your notes? Do you have notes from 3985

1     Ron Cahill's deposition?

2         A.   I have notes from all their depositions.

3         Q.   Do your notes reflect that Mrs. Loyd did not

4     smoke when she and Ron Cahill went on long bike rides?

5         A.   No. That's why I'm not recalling it.

6         Q.   Do you recall Ron Cahill talking about bike

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=728
7     rides that would last around three hours?

8         A.   No.

9         Q.   No? Okay.

10              She didn't smoke when she was driving in a

11      car from North Carolina to Michigan with her brother

12     Jack, did she?

13         A.   Not while in the car. I think there were

14     breaks, as I recall.

15         Q.   Well, the drive from North Carolina to

16     Michigan took about eight hours, right?

17         A.   That would be a fast drive. I don't know how

18     long it took.

19         Q.   All right. But you know from that deposition

20     that Mrs. Loyd never said, Pull over, I need to have a

21      cigarette right now, did she?

22         A.   Yeah. I recall that.

23         Q.   You recall that she didn't do that?

24         A.   Yeah.

25         Q.   Okay. Now, Mrs. Loyd didn't smoke in her 3986

1     parents' house, did she?

2         A.   Correct.

3         Q.   She didn't smoke in her own house after her

4     father became sick with emphysema, did she?

5         A.   That's right.

6         Q.   She didn't smoke in her daughter Amber's

7     house, did she?

8         A.   No.

9         Q.   She didn't smoke in her stepdaughter Deborah

10     Mitchell's house --

11          A.   No. She-

12         Q.    because Deborah's daughter had asthma,

13     right?

14         A.   That's right. She would go outside.

15         Q.   And beginning in the late 1970s, Mrs. Loyd

16     didn't smoke around her granddaughter Paula because

17     Paula had asthma, right?

18         A.   Correct.

19         Q.   All right. So in spite of all of that, you

20     scored Mrs. Loyd as finding it difficult to refrain

21      from smoking in places where it was forbidden?

22         A.   Yes. She would get up from the restaurants

23     to smoke. She found it hard to go two to three hours

24     without smoking, was the testimony that I came across.

25     She found it hard to refrain from smoking. 3987

1          Q.   Okay.

2         A.   Okay.

3         Q.   Let's talk about the next one, No. 3. Which

4     cigarette would you hate to give up the most? And you

5     said you couldn't answer that question, right?

6         A.   Correct.

7         Q.   All right. We talked about that.

8              Let's see. Let me skip No. 4 for one moment

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=729
9     because you said that No. 5, Do you smoke more

10     frequently during the first hours after awakening than

11      during the rest of the day? That's another one that

12     you had to skip for this test, right?

13         A.   That's right.

14         Q.   Okay. All right. And then that leaves No.

15     6: Do you smoke even if you are so ill that you are in

16     bed most of the day? Right?

17         A.   That's right.

18         Q.   Now, the fact of the matter is, you reviewed

19     all the depositions in the case, right?

20         A.   That's right.

21          Q.   Not a single witness testified that

22     Jacqueline Loyd smoked even if she was so ill that she

23     was in bed most of the day?

24         A.   I think the -- she would continue to smoke

25     when she got sick. That was from Mr. Ellis. 3988

1          Q.   It doesn't ask whether you smoked when you

2     got sick, does it?

3         A.   No.

4         Q.   Isn't the question, do you smoke even if you

5     are so ill that you are in bed most of the day?

6         A.   Right.

7         Q.   And nobody said that in this case, did they?

8         A.   I don't think they were asked that question.

9     I'm pretty sure they were not asked that question, so I

10     based it on my interpretation. And certainly there's

11      evidence that she continued to smoke despite illness,

12     which is one of the hallmarks of being addicted to a

13     drug.

14         Q.   By the way, you keep coming back to what was

15     asked and wasn't asked. You've been doing this for a

16     long time, haven't you, Dr. Cummings?

17         A.   I have, since 1996.

18         Q.   You've been deposed yourself, right?

19         A.   Yes, I have.

20         Q.   And you've read -- how many depositions do

21      you think you've read when you've been doing this?

22         A.   In this case, I read over a dozen.

23         Q.   Not just this case. Total. How many

24     depositions have you read in your career, testifying?

25         A.   I have not counted them. 3989

1          Q.   Probably hundreds, right? Maybe more?

2         A.   Probably.

3         Q.   Okay. And you know from your own experience

4     being deposed and from depositions that you've read,

5     that every party in the case, including the plaintiff,

6     that their lawyers have an opportunity to ask

7     questions, right?

8         A.   Sometimes they do, yes.

9         Q.   Okay. Sometimes they do?

10         A.   Well, given the nature of the depositions

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=730
11      that I've read, sometimes they're just dragged on so

12     long, they put the family through misery. They just

13     want to end it. That's what I've seen in my experience

14     reading hundreds of depositions.

15         Q.   That's what you concluded from reading

16     depositions?

17         A.   I've seen that, yes.

18         Q.   The fact of the matter is, though, regardless

19     of how long the deposition is, the plaintiffs lawyers

20     including in this case do have a chance to ask whatever

21      questions they want, right?

22         A.   Sure.

23         Q.   Okay. And that's the information that you

24     get that you rely on is the answers to the questions

25     that are asked by all the parties, right? 3990

1         A.   No. That would be a mischaracterization. I

2     rely on all of the information that's shared for me,

3     including the questions that are asked by defendants,

4     by plaintiffs, by the -- that are contained in medical

5     records and any other evidence that I can get. And if

6     the individual is still around, I've often interviewed

7     them. I was just not able to do that in this case.

8         Q.   My question wasn't whether depositions are

9     the only thing that you rely on. But the questions

10     that are asked by both sides' attorneys are the

11      questions that generate the answers, and you rely on

12     those answers, right?

13         A.   Certainly.

14         Q.   If a question isn't asked for whatever reason

15     on a question like this, do you smoke even if you are

16     so ill that you are in bed most of the day, the result

17     is, you have no evidence to answer this question,

18     right?

19         A.   That's not true. I mean, there were -- there

20     was a question asked of her husband about her continued

21      smoking while ill. And the medical records indicate a

22     period of time where she's been advised by a doctor

23     because of illnesses that she's experiencing, some of

24     them quite severe, and the records indicate very

25     clearly that she was trying to cut back and quit but 3991

1      she was still smoking at that time.

2         Q.   Okay.

3         A.   Which is why I scored that a one.

4         Q.   Right. So let me ask you, what you found

5     isn't evidence that Mrs. Loyd smoked even if she was so

6     ill that she was in bed most of the day. What you

7     found and what you're relying on eliminates that part

8     of the test, eliminates this, so do you smoke even if

9     you are ill? You did find evidence of that, right?

10         A.   Yeah. I mean, she had been hospitalized at

11      various points in time.

12         Q.   Okay. All right.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=731
13         A.   Usually means you're in bed.

14         Q.   Well, now, are you just assuming that she was

15     in bed in order to answer this question or did you just

16     rely on evidence that she smoked when she was ill?

17         A.   Based on my 33 years experience working in

18     hospitals, generally patients who go into the hospital

19     are put in a bed.

20         Q.   All right. So this is kind of like the other

21      answer about when she woke up in the morning, the

22     evidence doesn't actually say that, but you -- it's

23     good enough for you, right?

24              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, argumentative, Your

25         Honor. 3992

1              THE COURT: Sustained.

2     BY MR. WALKER:

3         Q.   Let's be clear. It was never asked and never

4     answered by anyone in this case whether Mrs. Loyd

5     smoked even if she was so ill that she was in bed most

6     of the day, yes or no, Doctor?

7              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, asked and answered.

8              THE COURT: Overruled.

9              THE WITNESS: Yes. This question wasn't

10         asked in any of the depositions that I saw.

11      BY MR. WALKER:

12         Q.   Now, the only one that we haven't talked

13     about is No. 4, right?

14         A.   I think we did talk about it earlier, but we

15     can talk about it again.

16         Q.   I mean, on the Fagerstrom, the Fagerstrom

17     test.

18         A.   Sure.

19         Q.   I skipped over that earlier, right? We went

20     one, two, three, and then went to five and six just

21      now?

22         A.   That's right.

23         Q.   So what's left, how many cigarettes per day

24     do you smoke, right?

25         A.   Right. 3993

1          Q.   Again, that's where this whole thing started,

2     right, with your opinion that if you're a daily smoker,

3     you're addicted?

4         A.   Persistent daily smoker, sure.

5         Q.   Now, I want to ask you some questions about

6     addiction and even about addicted smokers. Isn't it

7     true that even addicted smokers can quit smoking?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   All right. Addicted smokers can and do quit

10     smoking every day, don't they?

11          A.   They do.

12         Q.   And you --

13         A.   Most of them relapse, but...

14         Q.   Well, you've written that everyone can quit

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=732
15     smoking, right?

16         A.   Everybody can quit. Most relapse back.

17         Q.   You never tell anybody that comes -- that

18     came to your smoking clinic at Ro swell Park, you know

19     what, it's impossible for you to quit. You never said

20     that, did you?

21          A.   No. That would be pretty discouraging to

22     people. We work with them to help them quit.

23         Q.   According to the Surgeon General, there are

24     more former smokers in the United States than there are

25     current smokers, true? 3994

1         A.   When?

2         Q.   Today.

3         A.   Today. That's true.

4         Q.   Okay. And as we discussed earlier, since the

5      1964 Surgeon General's report, something like 60

6     million people have quit smoking, right?

7         A.   Yes.

8         Q.   And that includes Mrs. Loyd because she quit

9     smoking in 1993, right?

10         A.   Correct.

11          Q.   All right. Now, in your view --in your

12     view, all of those millions of people who quit smoking,

13     the vast majority of them were addicted, right?

14         A.   When I was asked that question previously, I

15     answered yes.

16         Q.   All right. In fact, millions and millions of

17     heavily addicted smokers have quit, haven't they?

18         A.   Yes.

19         Q.   And those millions and millions of heavily

20     addicted smokers who quit had the same types of brain

21      alterations, nicotinic receptors, and so forth you

22     talked about, right?

23         A.   The same? No. I wouldn't say identical.

24     There's individual variation.

25         Q.   Dr. Cummings, of the millions and millions of 3995

1     heavily addicted smokers who quit, they have the same

2     types of nicotinic receptors that everybody else does,

3     right?

4         A.   Well, everybody has nicotinic receptors in

5     their body. Smokers have more of those receptors

6     because the structure and the wiring in the brain is

7     affected by their exposure to the drug.

8         Q.   And that's true of the millions and millions

9     of heavily addicted smokers who quit?

10         A.   Yeah. The brains of smokers are different

11      than the brains of nonsmokers, but there's individual

12     variation between the brains of smokers. That's what I

13     was pointing out.

14         Q.   Most of the 60 million people who have quit

15     in the United States have done so cold turkey, right?

16         A.   That's true.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=733
17         Q.   So most of the people who quit smoking didn't

18     go to a clinic like the one you ran at Roswell, did

19     they?

20         A.   That's true.

21          Q.   Without going to a clinic like that,

22     nevertheless they were still able to stop smoking,

23     right?

24         A.   Yes.

25         Q.   Now, after a person quits smoking, the 3996

1     nicotine is out of their system after two or three days

2     if not sooner, right?

3         A.   The nicotine is. There are byproducts of

4     nicotine or metabolites that last longer, but that's

5     true about nicotine.

6         Q.   And you would agree that withdrawal symptoms

7     don't make it impossible for someone to quit smoking

8     permanently?

9         A.   Sure.

10         Q.   In fact, when you were at Roswell Park, one

11      of the things that you did was to run a cessation

12     clinic that you talked about, right?

13         A.   Yeah. Over a period of years.

14         Q.   And you've already referenced a few times the

15     thousands of smokers that you saw in your work at the

16     cessation clinic, right?

17         A.   Right.

18         Q.   In fact, you wrote a guide for the American

19     Cancer Society called Smart Move, A Stop Smoking Guide.

20     Isn't that right?

21          A.   I have written several guides, but that's one

22     of them, yep.

23         Q.   And it provides guidance for people who want

24     to quit smoking, right?

25         A.   It does. 3997

1          Q.   And you used it in your clinic in New York,

2     right?

3         A.   Right. It's got a readiness test to see

4     whether people are ready to make the quit attempt in

5     the beginning and some advice on how to quit.

6         Q.   And certainly you believed the information

7     that it contains is accurate, right?

8         A.   At the time, yes.

9         Q.   And truthful?

10         A.   I believe so.

11          Q.   You would vouch for the information in this

12     publication that you wrote, right?

13         A.   At the time, yeah.

14         Q.   Let me bring you -- hand you a copy.

15              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

16              THE COURT: Yes.

17              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

18     BY MR. WALKER:

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=734
19         Q.   Sure. All right. Now, in your Smart Move

20     guide, the stop-smoking guide, you have testimonials

21      from patients from your clinic, right?

22         A.   That's right.

23         Q.   You put those testimonials in the guide as a

24     motivator to show people that there are other people

25     who successfully quit, right? 3998

1         A.   That's right.

2         Q.   So it starts out with some testimonials.

3              MR. WALKER: In fact, can we show this ? Any

4         objection to me showing this?

5              MR. UITERWYK: No objection.

6     BY MR. WALKER:

7         Q.   I got ahead of myself there. Smart Move,

8     exclamation point. A stop smoking guide, American

9     Cancer Society. And that's the guide we've just been

10     talking about, right?

11          A.   That's right.

12         Q.   Okay. So this guide that you put together to

13     help people quit, it starts out with some testimonials.

14     And the first one is from someone named Yvette J,

15     right?

16         A.   Correct.

17         Q.   Right at the bottom there, it says, "I always

18     thought it would be impossible to stop. Anyone can do

19     it if they set their mind to it, a positive attitude is

20     important," right?

21          A.   Yes.

22              MR. UITERWYK: Can we get a date on this

23         document, please?

24     BY MR. WALKER:

25         Q.   What's the date, Doctor? 3999

1         A.   Well, the date on this version is 1997. I

2     produced this originally, I think, in 1988.

3         Q.   1997?

4         A.   When it was first published.

5         Q.   Okay. Now, then it says, "Yvette J, former

6     one-and-a-half-pack-a-day smoker," right?

7         A.   Yes.

8         Q.   Now, when Yvette J smoked as a persistent

9     daily smoker, her brain would have been altered in all

10     the ways that you told the jury about, right?

11          A.   Sure.

12         Q.   Okay. Now, in your brochure you also have a

13     checklist asking people if they have what it takes to

14     stop smoking, don't you?

15         A.   That's right.

16         Q.   Okay. The first question is, "Do you want to

17     stop smoking?" Right?

18         A.   Correct.

19         Q.   And that's a question that relates to an

20     issue of motivation, right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=735
21          A.   All of the questions relate to motivation.

22     This is a motivation readiness scale.

23         Q.   That's because it takes motivation to quit

24     smoking, right?

25         A.   You have to decide you're going to quit, yes. 4000

1          Q.   Second question, "Are you willing to make

2     some changes in your daily routine," right?

3         A.   Right.

4         Q.   And if you want to be successful at quitting,

5     you agree that you must be willing to make some changes

6     in your daily routine, right?

7         A.   It helps, yes.

8         Q.   Third question, "Are you willing to put up

9     with some uneasy moments after stopping," right?

10         A.   Yes.

11          Q.   You agree that that's there because there may

12     be some uneasy moments after stopping, right?

13         A.   That's right.

14         Q.   If you want to succeed you have to put up

15     with that, right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   Then you say, "If you can answer yes to all

18     three questions, you can stop smoking." Right?

19         A.   That's right. You're ready to quit. You're

20     ready to make a quit attempt.

21          Q.   You have to be ready to make a quit attempt,

22     right?

23         A.   That's right.

24         Q.   Let's look at the next one. This is Norma C.

25      "The most important thing is to really make the 4001

1      commitment and the decision to stop. No program can

2     benefit you until the decision to stop is made."

3     Right?

4         A.   Right.

5         Q.   And this is from a former

6     two-and-a-half-pack-a-day smoker, correct?

7         A.   That's right.

8         Q.   Okay. Now, let's go to the next. This is

9     all from your pamphlet that you wrote, right?

10         A.   Correct.

11          Q.   "The good news about stopping. Have you ever

12     said, Why bother stopping? The damage is already done.

13     Wrong. Your body begins to repair itself as soon as

14     you stop smoking. Within a few days, mucus in your

15     airways breaks up and clears out of your lungs. Within

16     a few weeks, circulation improves and you will be able

17     to smell and taste more. Within a year, your risk of

18     lung cancer begins to decrease." That's all true,

19     right?

20         A.   That's true.

21          Q.   Okay. Let's look at the next portion.

22              Now, we've got a heading, "Stopping. Develop

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=736
23     a plan, change some habits, the bottom line, make a

24     commitment." You agree with that, right?

25         A.   Sure. 4002

1          Q.   Okay. And then you describe to your readers

2     of this guide what some withdrawal symptoms can be

3     like, right?

4         A.   Right.

5         Q.   Let's take a look at that. Let's start at

6     the top.  "Getting over smoking. The nicotine in

7     cigarette smoke is addictive. This means that as a

8     smoker, your body has gotten used to a certain level of

9     nicotine. After you stop smoking, you may feel some

10     body and mood changes. As your body adjusts to the

11      absence of the nicotine that you used to get from

12     cigarettes, you may be" -- and then it goes on to list

13     some of them, right?

14         A.   That's right.

15         Q.   The first one is "Irritable. At first,

16     without nicotine, you may feel nervous or touchy. Try

17     exercising. It will help you feel better." Then you

18     have listed, tired, trouble sleeping, hunger, cough or

19     dry mouth, and depression, right?

20         A.   That's right.

21          Q.   But your body adjusts to the absence of

22     nicotine, right?

23         A.   Eventually it does.

24         Q.   Okay. And then you say, "Remember, you may

25     not have any of these feelings. If you do, don't 4003

1     worry, it's normal. You may not feel the same as

2     others who are stopping. Hang in there. These

3     feelings will go away. Give yourself a chance to get

4     over smoking," right?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And that statement there about the feelings

7     going away, that's true, isn't it?

8         A.   The withdrawal tends to be most intense right

9     after you quit and it tends to lessen over time.

10     There's individual variability in this and it can be

11      helped by the use of nicotine replacement products.

12     That's primarily what they're used for is to address

13     the withdrawal.

14         Q.   Let me put a finer point on it. You used to

15     tell people in your clinic that cravings are relatively

16     short and last only about a minute or two. True?

17         A.   When they happen, yes, they come on you like

18     a wave. But the duration of cravings can, since

19     they're learned associations, can go on for years.

20         Q.   Well, withdrawal symptoms, overall, usually

21     peak within a few days and then decline after that,

22     right?

23         A.   The ones that I listed, such as being

24     irritable and agitated and problems sleeping and so on

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=737
25     tend to go on for about a three- to four-week period. 4004

1     Again, there's individual variation. Cravings are

2     associated with things that have been linked to the

3     regular drug administration of nicotine, sort of like

4     Pavlovian response that we talked about earlier.

5         Q.   So let's talk about that period. On average,

6     physical withdrawal symptoms will end after about three

7     weeks or so, correct?

8         A.   On average, that's true. They can go on

9     longer for some people and shorter for others.

10         Q.   And you've testified that nicotine leaves the

11     body fairly quickly after you stop smoking, right?

12         A.   Large amount of individual variability, but

13     yes. Nicotine has a relatively short half-life, but

14     there's -- nicotine metabolism differs and is related

15     to individual variation and addiction.

16         Q.   Usually two or three days after you smoke

17     your last cigarette, nicotine is out of your system,

18     right?

19         A.   Yeah. Nicotine can't be measured after about

20     two or three days.

21          Q.   All right.

22         A.   Codeine can, which is a metabolite.

23         Q.   You're familiar with a website,

24     smokefree.gov, right?

25         A.   Sure. 4005

1          Q.   It's run by the National Cancer Institute,

2     right?

3         A.   Yes.

4         Q.   It's listed as a resource on the South

5     Carolina smoking cessation website where you are now,

6     right?

7         A.   That's right.

8         Q.   The website is intended to help people quit

9     smoking, right?

10         A.   It is.

11          Q.   And you believe it's a trustworthy source of

12     information, right?

13         A.   Yes.

14         Q.   Okay.

15              MR. UITERWYK: I need to object, Your Honor.

16         Approach?

17              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, may I hand a copy to

18         the witness while we're doing this?

19              THE COURT: Yes.

20              (At sidebar.)

21               MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, I'll object to

22         this on relevance. This occurred, and I'm not

23         even sure --1 know it's after 1993 that this

24         website even existed. I'm not sure exactly the

25         date, but I know it's after 1993, and I don't see 4006

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=738
1         the relevance. She had quit by 1993.

2              THE COURT: Response?

3              MR. WALKER: Judge, the witness already

4         talked about data and statistics and tests that

5         post-date her quitting. So I don't see why this

6         is any different. We just finished going through

7         his Smart Move pamphlet. He vouched for the

8         trustworthiness of this, and he's already talked

9         in direct examination about information that was

10         available in 2007 and forward. He used the

11          National Institute of Drug Abuse test which was a

12         2007 test.

13              THE COURT: Your objection is overruled.

14              Mr. Walker?

15              MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor?

16              THE COURT: About how long to go?

17              MR. WALKER: Let me take a quick look.

18              THE COURT: Okay. All right. I guess that

19         answers it.

20              (End of sidebar.)

21               THE COURT: Let's take a five-minute recess,

22         please.

23              THE BAILIFF: All rise.

24              (Jury exited the courtroom at 5:01 p.m.)

25              MR. WALKER: It's less than 20 pages, Judge, 4007

1          so I would guess 20 minutes, 25 minutes.

2              THE COURT: Okay. We're going to take a

3         five-minute break. So we'll be in recess for five

4         minutes. You can step out if you need to,

5         Dr. Cummings.

6              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

7              (Recess taken from 5:02 p.m. to 5:06 p.m.)

5              (Jury in at 5:07 p.m.)

6              THE COURT: Okay. Thank you. Thank you for

7         your patience.

8              You may proceed.

9              MR. WALKER: Thank you, Judge.

10              All right. Can we display the smokefree.gov?

11      BY MR. WALKER:

12         Q.   This is a printout of the website we were

13     just talking about, and I want to direct your attention

14     to the Benefits of Quitting section. Do you see that?

15         A.   Yes.

16         Q.   It says there, "Many people who quit smoking

17     are surprised by how good they feel," right?

18         A.   Yes.

19         Q.   Okay. And then it lists some examples

20     underneath that; they feel in charge, they smell good,

21      they feel more relaxed, they look and feel better.

22     Right?

23         A.   Right.

24         Q.   And then under that it says, "The reality of

25     quitting." Do you see that? 4013

1         A.   I do.

2         Q.   And it says, "Quitting smoking" -- "Quitting

3     smoking is hard work but it can be done. Millions of

4     people just like you have become and are still former

5     smokers." Right?

6         A.   Right.

7         Q.   Then it says, "I will crave cigarettes, but

8     cravings will pass. Most cravings only last a few

9     minutes, and over time the urge to smoke -- the urges

10     to smoke will get weaker and come less often." You

11      agree with that statement, right?

12         A.   I do.

13         Q.   Okay. And then below that there's a

14     reference to withdrawal. Do you see that?

15         A.   Yes.

16         Q.   Now, in your testimony with Mr. Uiterwyk, you

17     had a demonstrative aid where you had a whole list of

18     irritability and other things that you said were

19     withdrawal symptoms, right?

20         A.   That's right.

21          Q.   Okay. "Withdrawal is uncomfortable but it

22     isn't painful, it's for a short time and it's

23     manageable."

24              Did I read that correctly?

25         A.   Yes. Except for the cravings and there's a 4014

1     lot of individual variations.

2         Q.   Did I miss a word there you're saying?

3         A.   Yeah. Craving is different because it tends

4     to go on much longer.

5         Q.   I think we're -- you and I are not

6     communicating. It says, "Withdrawal is uncomfortable

7     but it isn't painful, it's for a short time and it's

8     manageable."

9              Did I read that correctly?

10         A.   You did. You read that correctly.

11          Q.   Okay. Now, over the years, the Surgeon

12     General has also referred to smoking as a personal

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=743
13     choice behavior, right?

14         A.   You can find references to that, yes.

15         Q.   Now, all of the Surgeon General's reports are

16     peer-reviewed, right?

17         A.   Correct.

18         Q.   You told us -- maybe you didn't, but there's

19     a process by which the Surgeon General's reports go out

20     in terms of teams of scientists reviewing them,

21      correct?

22         A.   That's right.

23         Q.   Then there are comments?

24         A.   Correct.

25         Q.   And you've been reviewer for some of the 4015

1      Surgeon General's reports, right?

2         A.   Reviewer, contributor, overall report

3     reviewer.

4         Q.   When you were a reviewer, you received drafts

5     and you had a chance to mark them up as to what they

6     were going to say or what you thought they should say,

7     right?

8         A.   True.

9         Q.   And until the Surgeon General gets the drafts

10     and edits back from the peer reviewers like yourself

11      when you've done that, they don't put the final product

12     together; is that right?

13         A.   Right. They have to resolve every comment

14     they have had.

15         Q.   So the final product for a Surgeon General's

16     report reflects the thoughts of the peer reviewers who

17     have looked at the draft and commented on it, right?

18         A.   Sure.

19         Q.   Now, in 1977, '78, the Surgeon General

20     reported that cigarette smoking represents a category

21      of health problems that can be called personal choice

22     health behavior, true?

23         A.   You can find a statement to that effect. I

24     don't think it was a conclusion of the report. But it

25     is a statement that's in some of the reports. 4016

1          Q.   Well, I'm asking you about --

2         A.   That's true. That's a true statement, and

3     you can find a reference to it, but it's not a

4     conclusion.

5         Q.   In the 1982 Surgeon General's report, the

6     Surgeon General again referred to smoking as a, quote,

7     personal choice behavior, right?

8         A.   Same answer that I just gave, yes.

9         Q.   Okay. So when you say you can find

10     references to smoking as a personal choice behavior,

11      you can find that in the 1977 and the 1982 Surgeon

12     General's reports, right?

13         A.   Yes. It's just like a statement that's made.

14     It's not a conclusion, it's not -- it's just a

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=744
15     statement that someone's made.

16         Q.   Just a statement?

17         A.   That's right.

18         Q.   Okay. In the 1986 report, the Surgeon

19     General said, "Cigarette smoking is an addictive

20     behavior, and the individual smoker must decide whether

21      or not to continue that behavior." Isn't that right?

22         A.   This is the'84 report?

23         Q.   Should be the'86 report, but -

24         A.   '86 report?

25         Q.    I'm reaching for it as we speak. 4017

1         A.   Yes, that's the one on secondhand smoke.

2         Q.   All right. You're going to want the whole

3     thing, aren't you?

4         A.   May as well have a stack.

5         Q.   You're working on your second and third stack

6     now, right? Here you are.

7         A.   Thank you.

8         Q.   Sure.

9              All right. This is the 1986 Surgeon

10     General's report. Just like all the other Surgeon

11      General reports we've talked about, this certainly was

12     part of the scientific literature that has informed

13     your opinions, right?

14         A.   Yes, it is.

15              MR. WALKER: Okay. May I display this,

16         Your Honor?

17              MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

18              THE COURT: All right.

19     BY MR. WALKER:

20         Q.   You said something about secondhand smoke,

21      and the title is "The Health Consequences of

22     Involuntary Smoking," right? That's what you were

23     referring to?

24         A.   Correct.

25         Q.   All right. And then if we were to turn to--4018

1     looks like it's page 12, Roman 12 -- by the way, just

2     down at the bottom there -- before we do that, down at

3     the bottom there -- there you go -- the Surgeon General

4     at the time of this report was C. Everett Koop, right?

5         A.   That's right.

6         Q.   Okay. And above that, it says, "Cigarette

7     smoking is an addictive behavior, and the individual

8     smoker must decide whether or not to continue that

9     behavior," right?

10         A.   That's what it says.

11          Q.   And you agree with that statement from the

12     Surgeon General, right?

13         A.   Sure.

14         Q.   You agree that individual smokers must decide

15     whether or not to continue smoking, true?

16         A.   They have to decide to quit. Whether you can

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=745
17     sustain quitting usually is a function of two things,

18     your biology and how the products are rigged to keep

19     you hooked.

20         Q.   You agree that individual smokers must decide

21      for themselves whether or not to try to quit smoking,

22     true?

23         A.   True.

24         Q.   Okay.

25         A.   Decide to make a quit attempt. 4019

1          Q.   Now, in those statements that we've talked

2     about or looked at from 1977, 1982, and 1986, the

3     Surgeon General didn't draw any distinction between a

4     free choice or a constrained choice, did he?

5         A.   Well, he's talking about addictive behavior

6     now.

7         Q.   Yeah. What I'm asking you is, you told the

8     jury about constrained choice.

9         A.   That's an addictive behavior.

10         Q.   But that term doesn't appear anywhere in the

11      1977, '82, or '86 reports that we just looked at, does

12     it?

13         A.   I've never checked.

14         Q.   All right. Well, you just saw--we just

15     talked about a few statements about choice. It didn't

16     say constrained choice in the ones we talked about, did

17     it?

18         A.   Not the ones you selected, no.

19         Q.   All right. Let's look at -- you're aware

20     that there was a Surgeon General's report in 2010,

21      right?

22         A.   Yes.

23         Q.   In fact, I think you talked about that in

24     your examination, right?

25         A.   Yes, I did. 4020

1          Q.   There was also a booklet that came with the

2     2010 Surgeon General's report, right?

3         A.   Yes.

4         Q.   And it was called, "How Tobacco Smoke Causes

5     Disease, What it Means to You?" Right?

6         A.   Yes.

7              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

8              THE COURT: Yes.

9     BY MR. WALKER:

10         Q.   What I've just handed you is the very

11     pamphlet we were just discussing, right?

12         A.   Yes.

13         Q.   Okay. Now, in the Surgeon General's booklet,

14     you remember that the Surgeon General stated that

15     quitting smoking was up to the smoker, right?

16         A.   Making a quit attempt, yes.

17         Q.   And this is -- what we're talking about is

18     essentially a consumer guide that was created by the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=746
19     CDC, right?

20         A.   That's right.

21          Q.   Centers for Disease Control?

22         A.   Right. On page 4, they talk about addiction.

23         Q.   All right. I want to ask you about page 16.

24              MR. WALKER: And, Your Honor, I would like to

25         display this, if I might. 4021

1     BY MR. WALKER:

2         Q.   This certainly is -- before that, this is --

3     this document that was attached to the 2010 Surgeon

4     General's report, this certainly is another part of the

5     broad literature that you reviewed and that has

6     influenced your opinions, right?

7         A.   Okay. That's -- it wasn't attached to the

8     2010. I mean, it was a -- you know, a consumer guide

9     that was put out along with the more technical

10     scientific report which I've reviewed.

11          Q.   All right. You've seen it?

12         A.   Sure. I've seen both the consumer guide and

13     certainly I participated in the production of the 2010

14     report.

15         Q.   And it's another one of those documents

16     that's within the broader group of documents that you

17     reviewed and that's impacted your opinions, right?

18         A.   I've seen this document.

19         Q.   Okay. Are you telling me that you don't rely

20     on this document from the Centers for Disease Control?

21          A.   No. I rely on the 2010 Surgeon General's

22     report, which is the technical report written for

23     scientists that I helped participate in developing and

24     reviewing.

25         Q.   But this information is accurate, is it not? 4022

1         A.   Yeah. It's written for lay people.

2         Q.   And it's authoritative, right?

3         A.   Well, not like the 2010 report. It's just

4     a -- it's a layman's summary that they put out.

5         Q.   Well, you tell me, Doctor. We've done this a

6     few times now. This is a document, a report of the

7     Surgeon General, How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease, What

8     it Means to You by the CDC. You told us about all the

9     documents you reviewed.

10              Is this or is this not a document that you

11      reviewed in connection with your work in this area or

12     your work testifying in cases? And is it not a

13     document that has informed your views on -- that you

14     took into consideration and that has informed your

15     views on all of these issues we've been talking about?

16         A.   The 2010 report is. This is just a summary

17     for consumers. This is not what I rely upon directly

18     for my opinions. I rely directly on the scientific

19     technical report, and this is a summary of that report.

20         Q.   But you agree with the information that's in

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=747
21      here, right?

22         A.   I'm not sure I agree with every word that's

23     in this consumer report, but I think -- yeah, generally

24     I think it's quite good. I'm glad the government does

25     it. 4023

1              MR. WALKER: All right. Your Honor, at this

2         time I would like to publish this pamphlet.

3              MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

4              THE COURT: All right.

5     BY MR. WALKER:

6         Q.   All right. So there's the report. I won't

7     read the title again.

8              Let's turn to page 16. And right under there

9     where it says, "What it Means to You? Now is the time

10     to quit smoking. No one can make you quit, and no one

11      can do it for you."

12              Right?

13         A.   That's right.

14         Q.   Okay. Now, you don't believe that the

15     Surgeon General or the CDC was misleading smokers when

16     that was said, do you?

17         A.   No.

18         Q.   Okay. Now, we already just looked at -- we

19     saw a reference to Surgeon General Koop, right?

20         A.   That's right.

21          Q.   And you would agree that he is a reliable and

22     authoritative source on quitting smoking, right?

23         A.   Yes.

24         Q.   All right.

25              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor? 4024

1              THE COURT: Yes.

2     BY MR. WALKER:

3         Q.   All right. I've just handed you an article

4     entitled "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do" from April of

5     2002. Do you see that?

6         A.   I do.

7         Q.   And you're familiar with this article, are

8     you not?

9         A.   I'm familiar with the website.

10         Q.   Okay. If you would turn to the second page,

11     please. My papers are now beginning to fall off.

12              You've reviewed this article before, have you

13     not?

14         A.   Sure.

15         Q.   And you've seen this. You're familiar with

16     the website where it appeared, are you not?

17         A.   Yes. I know Dr. Koop quite well.

18         Q.   All right. And you would agree with me that

19     Dr. Koop -- well, actually, you've already testified

20     about him being an authoritative source on quitting,

21      right?

22         A.   Sure.

23              MR. WALKER: Okay. I would like to display

24         Dr. Koop's article, "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do,"

25         Your Honor. 4025

1              THE COURT: Any objection, Mr. Uiterwyk?

2              MR. UITERWYK: Only that -- what I've stated

3         previously at the bench, Your Honor, as far as

4         timing. It's a 1999 document.

5              THE COURT: Okay. Overruled.

6     BY MR. WALKER:

7         Q.   Let's start with the first page, Breaking Up

8     Is Hard To Do. This is Dr. Koop.com. And if we could

9     turn to --1 guess it's the second page.

10              All right. Now, we have been -- we've been

11      talking -- or we were talking earlier about the

12     importance of motivation in quitting smoking, right?

13         A.   Right.

14         Q.   All right. Let's see what Dr. Koop said in

15     2002.

16              "When you are engaged in internal warfare

17     with yourself about whether or not to light up a

18     cigarette, you can fortify yourself by remembering this

19     important fact. Ultimately, you are the one that has

20     control over your behavior. The cigarette is not going

21      to light itself and jump into your mouth, nor are you

22     going to go into a brain-induced hypnotic trance and

23     light the cigarette. No matter how much you have

24     smoked or how much you like to smoke, the choice to

25     light up is always yours. Fighting the temptation to 4026

1      smoke is not easy. It is always a hard-won victory,

2     but the rewards are freedom, health, and empowerment.

3     If you prepare well and arm yourself with a variety of

4     strategies to combat the cravings, you can win!"

5              And there's an exclamation point there,

6     right?

7         A.   Yes.

8         Q.   Okay. Did I read that correctly?

9         A.   You did.

10         Q.   All right. Now, I want to talk a little bit

11      more about Mrs. Loyd's -- when she quit smoking, okay?

12         A.   Sure.

13         Q.   All right. Now, you testified on direct that

14     Mrs. Loyd's quitting behavior, based on your review of

15     the evidence, began in earnest in the early 1990s,

16     right?

17         A.   Based on the evidence that I've reviewed

18     prior to the deposition, yeah.

19         Q.   No. I'm talking about the testimony you gave

20     in this case, like, in the last week.

21          A.   Yeah.

22         Q.   You testified that her quitting behavior

23     began in earnest in the early 1990s.

24         A.   There's records of her quitting in earnest

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=749
25     beginning in 1991 -- '91 on, I believe. 4027

1          Q.   I understand that you mean that. Okay. And

2     you testified on direct that Mrs. Loyd quit smoking for

3     good in 1993, right?

4         A.   Correct. December.

5         Q.   All right. And you reviewed the medical

6     records in this case. We talked about that earlier,

7     right?

8         A.   I believe I showed some.

9         Q.   And you showed some and you told me when we

10     were talking about depositions, I didn't just review

11      depositions; I also reviewed medical records. Right?

12         A.   Yes.

13         Q.   All right. Let me hand you -- I'm actually

14     going to give you a few of these together so I won't

15     have to go back and forth. Give me just a second.

16         A.   Okay.

17         Q.   This is an idea I wish I had had earlier.

18         A.   Me, too.

19         Q.   All right. Even so, that didn't take long.

20              MR. WALKER: Mr. Uiterwyk, that's for you.

21          And a set for the -- may I approach, Your Honor?

22              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

23     BY MR. WALKER:

24         Q.   Sure.

25              Okay. Let's start with -- it should be the 4028

1     first one up. This is -- these are all in evidence, by

2     the way. These are some of Mrs. Loyd's medical records

3     from this period in the fall of 19 fall and winter

4     of 1993.

5         A.   Okay.

6         Q.   Okay. So first I want to ask you if you

7     would please take a look at the first page. That's an

8     initial evaluation of Dr. Jerry Wishik, right?

9         A.   Right.

10         Q.   Okay. So right at the top there, it says,

11      "Initial evaluation," right?

12         A.   Right.

13         Q.   And the date there is September 30th, 1993,

14     right?

15         A.   That's right.

16         Q.   Okay. And if you look down to the middle of

17     the document for smoking, Dr. Wishik circled "yes,"

18     right?

19         A.   Yes.

20         Q.   Okay. And next to that, for amount, it says,

21      "One pack per day," right?

22         A.   Right.

23         Q.   Okay. Let's turn to the next medical record,

24     which hopefully you already have.

25              This should now be another record from 4029

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=750
1     Dr. Wishik's office, this time from October 25th, 1993,

2     right?

3         A.   Okay.

4         Q.   Let me try to help you out.

5         A.   I'm looking for the date.

6         Q.   Yep.

7         A.   Yep, I can see it.

8         Q.   There it is at the top. And you see it's

9     Dr. Wishik, again; you saw that, right?

10         A.   That's right.

11          Q.   Okay. This is an office note. And on the

12     bottom of the record, you see where it says, "Smoking

13     ten cigarettes per day now," right?

14         A.   That's right.

15         Q.   That would be a half a pack per day, right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   Okay. So between the last record and this

18     record, Mrs. Loyd is down to a half a pack a day,

19     right?

20         A.   That's right.

21          Q.   And just below that, it says, "Suggest

22     Nicotrol patch."

23         A.   That's right.

24         Q.   Tell me if you agree, "Patient to read

25     literature and let me know if will agree to try." 4030

1         A.   Correct.

2         Q.   All right. Then on the top under "patient

3     instructions," a little bit higher, it says to stop

4     smoking. Do you see that?

5         A.   That's right.

6         Q.   And then it's signed by Dr. Wishik at the

7     bottom, right?

8         A.   That's right.

9         Q.   Okay. Let's move on to the next page.

10              The next record, this one now is -- we were

11     just in October. Now we're at November 4th, 1993.

12         A.   Correct.

13         Q.   See that?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   Okay. And this is a prescription by

16     Dr. Wishik, right?

17         A.   That's right.

18         Q.   It's a prescription for Nicotrol patches,

19      15 milligrams, right?

20         A.   That's right.

21          Q.   Signed by Dr. Wishik at the bottom.

22         A.   That's right.

23         Q.   Okay. Then if we go to the next record,

24     still in November, now just--how many days later? It

25     was November 9th. Five days later? 4031

1         A.   Five days, yep. A week.

2         Q.   Five days later. Okay. At the top again,

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=751
3     November 9th, 1993, Jerry Wishik, M.D., right?

4         A.   That's right.

5         Q.   All right. And then down below, just five

6     days later, the report is in quotes, "I stopped

7     cigarettes," right?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   All right. So you would agree with me that

10     according to these medical records, which you've

11      reviewed previously, Mrs. Loyd stopped smoking

12     cigarettes sometime on or before November 9th, 1993,

13     true?

14         A.   That would be true, although there is

15     evidence of her relapsing back, I believe.

16         Q.   Well, we'll look and see if we see that.

17     Okay?

18         A.   There's also other evidence of her quitting

19     and smoking from prior records until '93.

20         Q.   I want to talk about the fall and winter of

21      '93 right now. Okay?

22         A.   Okay.

23         Q.   So we started off with a record -- or

24     actually, the last one we looked at where she was still

25     smoking was October 25th, right? 4032

1         A.   Correct.

2         Q.   And then by November 9th, she had stopped

3     smoking, right?

4         A.   That's right.

5         Q.   That's a two-week period, right?

6         A.   Correct.

7         Q.   Okay. Now, let's look at the next record.

8     This one is a little less than a month later. It

9     should be December 3rd, 1993, right?

10         A.   That's right.

11          Q.   This is another office note of

12     Dr. Jerry Wishik, true?

13         A.   That's right.

14         Q.   Okay. And then if we look down to the

15     middle, there's a handwritten number 1. See that?

16         A.   Yes.

17         Q.   And it says, "No more patches, quit 30 days,"

18     right?

19         A.   Correct.

20         Q.   All right. By the way, since we're talking

21      about medical records, how many medical records did you

22     say you reviewed for Mrs. Loyd?

23         A.   There was a whole notebook full of them. I

24     didn't count the pages, but several hundred.

25         Q.   Can you kind of show us again like you did 4033

1     with the green monster, how big was --

2         A.   About the size of the green monster.

3         Q.   About -

4         A.   About that big.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=752
5         Q.   -- yay big?

6         A.   Yeah.

7         Q.   The record will reflect yay big.

8              Okay. In all of those medical records that

9     you reviewed, you didn't find a single medical record

10     that contained a diagnosis of addiction -- nicotine

11      addiction for Mrs. Loyd, did you?

12         A.   Are you referring to an ICD code?

13         Q.   I'm referring--

14              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, Your Honor.

15              THE COURT: Pardon me?

16              MR. UITERWYK: It's not a diagnosis.

17              THE COURT: I'm sorry. I can't hear.

18              MR. UITERWYK: He's asking for a diagnosis.

19         He's asking him for a diagnosis.

20              THE COURT: Overruled.

21      BY MR. WALKER:

22         Q.   All right. Earlier you said that you don't

23     diagnose addiction, right?

24         A.   That's right.

25         Q.   And you said medical doctors do that, right? 4034

1         A.   That's right.

2         Q.   Okay. So in that big stack of medical

3     records that you reviewed, did you find a single

4     medical record in Mrs. Loyd's medical history, her

5     chart, that actually diagnosed her with nicotine

6     addiction; it said that in the record?

7         A.   At that time, I don't believe they had the

8     ICD code for nicotine addiction.

9         Q.   That means no, right?

10         A.   That would be no. That code came about in

11      1994,305.1.

12         Q.   All right. Now, after -- after this last

13     record that we saw, the truth is there's no medical

14     record at any time after 1993 that says that Mrs. Loyd

15     started smoking again, is there?

16         A.   After'93, no.

17         Q.   All right.

18         A.   December, I believe.

19         Q.   So '94, '95, all the way up to 2007, there is

20     no report in any of her medical records that she ever

21      went back to cigarette smoking, is there?

22         A.   I would agree with that.

23         Q.   All right. Now, on direct, you used a slide,

24     and I want to go back to -- do you have it up here?

25     Great. 4035

1              You were talking about Mrs. Loyd's attempts

2     to quit smoking, right?

3         A.   That's right.

4         Q.   And the first item you have there is, Finally

5     quit in 1993.

6         A.   Correct.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=753
7         Q.   See that?

8         A.   Uh-huh. (Indicates affirmatively.)

9         Q.   Then you list about ten or so different

10     methods that Mrs. Loyd used to try to quit smoking in

11      the early 1990s, right?

12         A.   That's right.

13         Q.   Okay. Now -- so you list, Tried to quit

14     using candy, chewing gum, bubble gum, sour ball

15     candies, lollypops, right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   Tried to stay active. Tried to quit cold

18     turkey. Switched to filter, light and lower tar and

19     lower nicotine cigarettes to help her quit.

20              Right? I'm doing good so far?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   All right. Used hypnosis, nicotine patches,

23     used a filter system, asked others not to smoke around

24     her, asked her husband to try to quit with her, and

25     finally had a support list to help her with the 4036

1      emotions that went along with trying to quit, right?

2         A.   That's right.

3         Q.   With the exception of nicotine patches,

4     everything on that list was available to Mrs. Loyd long

5     before she quit smoking in 1993, true?

6         A.   That's right. In fact, there's evidence she

7     switched to the lighter cigarettes in the '80s.

8         Q.   All of those potential ways of trying to quit

9     smoking were available to her in the 1950s if she had

10     wanted to quit, right?

11          A.   No, sir.

12         Q.   Which one wasn't?

13         A.   Well, low tar cigarettes didn't exist in the

14      1950s.

15         Q.   Okay. So nine out of the ten items that you

16     have listed -- or eight out of the ten items you have

17     listed, if we take off low tar cigarettes and patches,

18     all the rest of it was available to Mrs. Loyd if she

19     had wanted to quit in the 1950s.

20         A.   The filter systems that were sold over the

21      counter didn't come into play until the 1960s.

22         Q.   Okay. Any others?

23         A.   No.

24         Q.   Okay. Seven out of ten of the ways that you

25     listed on your chart were available to Mrs. Loyd to 4037

1     quit smoking in the 1950s had she wanted to do so,

2     true?

3         A.   True.

4         Q.   Okay. And then if we move into the 1960s,

5     how many out of ten?

6         A.   Again, the nicotine patches were not

7     available. In the '60s, low tar cigarettes really came

8     into being with one cigarette, Carlton.

9         Q.   What about the filter system?

10         A.   Filter systems were available at that time.

11          Q.   Okay.

12         A.   Late'60s.

13         Q.   So nine out of ten of the possible ways to

14     try to quit smoking on that list were available to

15     Mrs. Loyd in the 1960s, had she wanted to quit, right?

16         A.   Sure.

17         Q.   All right. Now, let's move into the 1970s.

18     The same nine out of ten were available to her. She

19     could have done any of those things except for the

20     nicotine patch in the 1970s if she wanted to quit,

21      true?

22         A.   True.

23         Q.   All right. And in the 1980s, if she wanted

24     to quit, she could have, for example, tried to stay

25     active, right? 4038

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   Tried to quit cold turkey?

3         A.   Correct.

4         Q.   She could have tried to quit using candy and

5     so on, right?

6         A.   Well, she did try. She switched to initially

7     the lower tar cigarettes.

8         Q.   By the way, during your direct examination,

9     you testified that addiction was a chronic relapsing

10     brain disease, right?

11          A.   True. That's the NIDA definition for a drug

12     addiction.

13         Q.   And by NIDA, you're referring to the National

14     Institutes of Drug Abuse, right?

15         A.   That's right.

16         Q.   That's the definition that they've used

17     starting in 2007, right?

18         A.   No. I believe that definition is earlier

19     than that.

20         Q.   Well, when did it start?

21          A.   I don't have the date. I would have to go

22     check.

23         Q.   In the 2000s?

24         A.   Certainly they've been using it for some

25     time, yeah. 4039

1          Q.   Okay. Now, you would agree with me that

2     there's no evidence that Mrs. Loyd tried to quit

3     smoking in the 1950s, is there?

4         A.   No.

5         Q.   There's no evidence that she tried to quit

6     smoking in the 1960s, is there?

7         A.   There's no evidence one way or the other. We

8     don't know.

9         Q.   There's no evidence that she tried to quit

10     smoking in the 1970s, is there?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=755
11          A.   I think there was --1 believe that she may

12     have quit at some time with her daughter's pregnancy in

13     the '60s.

14         Q.   Well, didn't you read that that's because she

15     was having morning sickness?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   All right. Do you consider not smoking while

18     you have morning sickness a motivated attempt to quit

19     smoking?

20         A.   Absolutely. Based on, you know, people I

21      have dealt with. When you're sick and you're so sick

22     you can't, you know, light up a cigarette, it's a quit

23     attempt. You're off for a while.

24         Q.   Do you think she was trying to quit

25     permanently or just until the morning sickness was 4040

1      over?

2         A.   I'm sure that wasn't the motivation for her

3     quitting, but sickness certainly was mentioned.

4         Q.   Sure.

5              What does the evidence say? Was there

6     evidence that she was trying to quit permanently when

7     she had morning sickness?

8         A.   The evidence that I've seen is that she went

9     right back to smoking after the delivery.

10         Q.   That's not my question. My question is, when

11      she stopped smoking during the morning sickness, the

12     truth is there's no evidence she intended to quit

13     permanently, is there?

14         A.   There's no evidence one way or the other.

15         Q.   Okay. Now, in the 1980s, there's no evidence

16     that she attempted to stop smoking altogether, is

17     there?

18         A.   She switched to light cigarettes in an effort

19     to quit.

20         Q.   There's no evidence that she was trying to

21      stop smoking altogether, is there? She switched from

22     one brand to another, according to you, right?

23         A.   Yes.

24         Q.   Okay.

25         A.   And -- well, according to me and according to 4041

1     the evidence in the case that I've reviewed.

2         Q.   Mm-hmm.

3         A.   Mm-hmm.

4         Q.   During your direct examination, you testified

5     that Mrs. Loyd quit smoking in '91 but relapsed, right?

6         A.   Several times, yes. Multiple quit attempts.

7     Seven to ten, as I recall her husband stating.

8         Q.   Well, there's no evidence in her medical

9     records that she -- that she tried to quit seven to ten

10     times, is there?

11          A.I don't think the number seven to ten is in

12     the medical records. There's certainly evidence in the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=756
13     medical records of her trying to cut back and quit

14     smoking.

15         Q.   In 1991, that was a single medical record

16     that you're relying on for that, right?

17         A.   I relied on all the medical records.

18         Q.   You relied on all the medical records for her

19     attempting to quit in 1991?

20         A.   I relied on all the records that I reviewed

21      that referenced her smoking.

22         Q.   How many records are there that suggest that

23     Mrs. Loyd was trying to quit smoking in 1991?

24         A.   In '91? I think there was one record in '91.

25         Q.   One record, right? 4042

1         A.   Yeah.

2         Q.   Okay. Now --

3         A.   One or two. I mean, I haven't really counted

4     them up. We showed the jury the records.

5         Q.   You haven't counted them. But maybe if I

6     show you them, you can.

7         A.   Sure.

8              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, Your Honor, move to

9         strike counsel's comments.

10              THE COURT: Overruled.

11               MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

12     BY MR. WALKER:

13         Q.   These are in evidence. Maybe take a look at

14     that record and tell me if that is the one and only

15     medical record that you're relying on for Mrs. Loyd

16     having tried to quit in 1991.

17         A.   It is one of the records I relied upon, yes.

18         Q.   Okay. Do you think there's another record

19     that suggests that she tried to quit in 1991?

20         A.   I didn't date them all. But most of the

21      records dated from '91 on. And so this was one of the

22     records that I looked at and I relied upon that

23     indicated she had tried to quit.

24         Q.   Let me try again. Is there another record

25     from 1991 --4043

1         A.   I don't recall.

2         Q.   Okay. Thank you.

3              Now, you were asked about this very medical

4     record in your deposition, right?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And your conclusion, when you were deposed

7     under oath, was that this particular record was

8     inaccurate; isn't that right?

9         A.   In what regard? I don't recall that.

10         Q.   Let me help you out. Let's have your

11      deposition from this case, the Evers case --

12              MR. WALKER: May I approach, Your Honor?

13              THE COURT: Yes.

14     BY MR. WALKER:

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=757
2         Q

3         A

4         Q

5         A

6         Q

7         A

8         Q

15         Q.   All right. This was your deposition in this

16     case, right?

17         A.   Yes, it was, 2009.

18         Q.   In 2009, right. This was January of 2009,

19     right?

20         A.   January 20th.

21          Q.   And there was no jury there, but you were

22     still under oath, right?

23         A.   Yes, sir.

24         Q.   And there was still a court reporter there,

25     right? 4044

1         A.   Yes.

Taking down the whole thing, right?

Yes, sir.

Okay. Let's take a look at page 11.

Okay.

Let's look at lines 2 through 22.

Okay.

"Question: Did you see inconsistencies in

9     the various documents that you reviewed?"

10              There's an objection.

11               Your answer was yes.

12              "Question: Okay. And could you describe

13     those inconsistencies for me?"

14              There's another objection. And then you

15     answered, "One of the inconsistencies had to do with a

16     report that she quit smoking in 1991. And as I went

17     through the deposition testimony, as well as other

18     medical records, it was clear that she quit smoking

19     after 1991.

20              "Question: You saw a particular record that

21      indicated she quit in '91 ?

22              "Answer: Yes.

23               "Question: And you came to the conclusion

24     based on your review of other documents that the

25     particular medical record was inaccurate? 4045

1               "Answer: Yes."

2              Did I read that correctly?

3         A.   You read it correctly, but I think the

4     statement is quite clear that there were other records

5     that indicated she quit later on. So this was a record

6     that she quit in '91. And so it would be a

7     misinterpretation to say I was saying the record was

8     inaccurate, if that's what you're trying to imply.

9         Q.I guess I'm just asking you if you said that

10     this medical record was inaccurate or not.

11          A.I don't deny that I said that, but I'm just

12     trying to give a clarification to what the -- what I

13     was trying to answer.

14         Q.   Sure. We've established --

15         A.   You're misrepresenting, I believe, my opinion

16     in this case.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=758
17         Q.   Well, let me ask you.

18         A.   Sure.

19         Q.   You've just agreed with me that you said it

20     was inaccurate. Is it inaccurate or not?

21          A.   No. I think what I was commenting on, that

22     she had quit after 1991. Clearly the record in '91

23     indicates that she had quit in '91, but it wasn't the

24     date that she had quit for good. That's what I was

25     reflecting. 4046

1          Q.   So when you said it was inaccurate, you were

2     just wrong about that?

3         A.   No. When I said it was inaccurate, you know,

4     perhaps I wasn't as precise as I'm being now.

5         Q.   Okay. Now, some smokers enjoy smoking and

6     want to continue smoking, true?

7         A.   Sure.

8         Q.   At your smoking cessation clinic, some people

9     went just because they were dragged in there by a

10     spouse, a husband or a wife, or a family member who

11      wanted them to quit smoking, right?

12         A.   That's true.

13         Q.   Okay. Some people say they want to quit, but

14     when you talk to them, you realize they're not

15     motivated and have no intention of quitting at that

16     time, true?

17         A.   At any point in time, that's true. Sure.

18         Q.   At any given point in time, a person has to

19     be ready to quit, and some people are not ready to quit

20     at a given point in time, right?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   And you have to want to quit in order to

23     quit, right?

24         A.   Sure.

25         Q.   If someone doesn't really try to quit, 4047

1     they're not going to quit, right?

2         A.   Right. You have to have the facts and

3     information.

4         Q.   All right.

5              MR. UITERWYK: I didn't know which one it

6         was.

7              THE WITNESS: That's not the one we showed.

8     BY MR. WALKER:

9         Q.   You didn't show this one?

10         A.   I don't believe so.

11          Q.I think you did.

12         A.   Well, maybe we did.

13         Q.   Well, did you prepare this demonstrative?

14         A.   I did. I had taken out the six months quits.

15     I think we only had the four bars.

16         Q.   Okay. So you had a version of this. Maybe

17     the one I was given isn't the right one?

18         A.   I believe it's not the right one.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=759
19         Q.   Because it's got an extra bar. Which bar is

20     it, the second to last one?

21          A.   That's right.

22         Q.   I'll cross that out for now --

23         A.   Sure.

24         Q.    so we don't slow things down. Will that

25     work? The rest of the information is the same, right? 4048

1         A.   Yeah. It would work better if you used

2     exhibits, but go ahead.

3              MR. WALKER: Do you have it?

4              MR. UITERWYK: Yeah.

5              THE WITNESS: That's all right. Go ahead.

6         We're late. Please go.

7     BY MR. WALKER:

8         Q.   That's what I was saying.

9              Okay. So you showed a chart, and when he

10     finds it, I'll swap it out.

11          A.   You can go ahead. Just go ahead.

12         Q.   Okay. And the reason you were showing this

13     chart is because you were focused on this last bar here

14     at the end, right? Less than 3 percent of smokers

15     succeed and remain abstinent in a given year. In fact,

16     that's in the title?

17         A.   It's in the title, but the reason I showed it

18     was for all these statistics.

19         Q.   Let me ask you about these other bars.

20         A.   Sure.

21          Q.   This chart indicates that at the time that

22     this particular data was conducted, there were 45

23     million smokers, right?

24         A.   That's right.

25         Q.   Only 31 million of them were saying they 4049

1     wanted to quit, right?

2         A.   At a point in time.

3         Q.   At that point in time. So that would mean

4     that there are 14 million people who are not saying

5     they want to quit, right?

6         A.   Right. Out of the 45 million, the majority,

7     if you asked them, do you want to quit, will say yes,

8     at the point in time.

9         Q.   All right. So you've just told us about the

10     majority and minority, but the fact of the matter is

11      you know from your review of this case that, for

12     example, Mrs. Loyd never told Cindy, her daughter,

13     Cindy Evers, the plaintiff or anyone else that she

14     wanted to quit smoking before the early 1990s, true?

15         A.   Yes.

16         Q.   Okay. So Mrs. Loyd, before the early 1990s,

17     was not in this 31 million who said she wanted to quit,

18     she would have been in the 14 million who didn't say

19     she wanted to quit, true?

20         A.   No. Not true.

21          Q.   All right.

22         A.   We wouldn't know.

23         Q.   I'm going to move on.

24              MR. UITERWYK: Here you go.

25              MR. WALKER: Great. Thank you. 4050

1     BY MR. WALKER:

2         Q.   Okay. So assume for one moment that we're

3     only interested in the evidence in this case, okay?

4     Just hypothetically?

5         A.   I'm always concerned with the evidence of the

6     case.

7         Q.   There's no evidence in this case that

8     Mrs. Loyd was part of the majority who said they wanted

9     to quit, before the early 1990s, correct?

10         A.   Correct. We don't know one way or the other.

11          Q.   Okay. No evidence one way or the other,

12     right?

13         A.   Well, not entirely. She switched to the

14     lower-yield cigarettes in the '80s.

15         Q.   Well, I didn't ask you what she switched to.

16     My point is, your chart talks about people who say they

17     want to quit smoking, right?

18         A.   That's right. At a point in time.

19         Q.   All right. Now, of the 31 million who say

20     they want to quit, only 16 million actually tried to

21      quit, right?

22         A.   That's right.

23         Q.   Okay.

24         A.   In a given year.

25         Q.   So out of the 45 million people who are 4051

1      smoking, only a percentage of them say they want to

2     quit and only a percentage of those even actually do

3     something about it, right?

4         A.   That's right. About half of those who say

5     they want to quit will make a quit attempt in a given

6     year.

7         Q.   Okay. So by half, according to your chart,

8     we're talking about, what, 15 million of the people who

9     say they want to quit do absolutely nothing about it,

10     right?

11          A.   Actually you can read the numbers. It says

12      16 million.

13         Q.   That's the 16 who try to quit, right?

14         A.   That's right.

15         Q.   The difference between the 16 who try to quit

16     and the 31 that say they want to quit is 15 million,

17     right?

18         A.   Sorry, I misinterpreted the question.

19         Q.   That's okay. It's getting late.

20              Now, then at the end here, you have 1.3

21      million who actually succeed in quitting smoking,

22     right?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=761
23         A.   That's right.

24         Q.   And you know that for 1993, Mrs. Loyd was

25     part of the 1.3 million that succeeded in quitting and 4052

1     never went back to smoking, true?

2         A.   After many attempts, yes.

3         Q.   All right. Now, you would agree that an

4     individual smoker has to decide whether or not to

5     continue smoking, right?

6         A.   They have to -- yeah, they have to decide to

7     make a quit attempt.

8         Q.   And the bottom line is that you believe

9     smokers have a responsibility to try to quit, right?

10         A.   I believe the smoker has a responsibility and

11      the companies have the responsibility to make sure

12     their consumers are informed and --

13         Q.   You believe --

14         A.   -- and not to, you know, smoking cigarettes

15     and make it harder for them to quit than it should be.

16         Q.   Dr. Cummings, we're almost done.

17         A.   That's what my belief is.

18         Q.   I would like you to --

19         A.   You asked for it.

20         Q.    focus on what I'm asking.

21               THE COURT: Try to answer the question

22         pending.

23              THE WITNESS: Yeah.

24     BY MR. WALKER:

25         Q.   You believe that a smoker is fully 4053

1     responsible for making the choice to try to quit, yes

2     or no?

3         A.   No.

4         Q.   All right. Let's --

5         A.   Because of what I just stated. That the

6     companies that manufacture the product have some

7     responsibility as well.

8         Q.   Dr. Cummings?

9         A.   And that's what I've stated previously.

10         Q.   You just said that. Do you have your Denton

11      testimony in front of you still?

12         A.   I don't know if I do or not.

13         Q.   It should be there. It's from July of last

14     year, right?

15         A.   Sure. Go ahead.

16              MR. UITERWYK: Hold on.

17     BY MR. WALKER:

18         Q.   It's page 295.

19              MR. UITERWYK: Just a minute. I've got to

20         find mine.

21               THE WITNESS: 295. Got it.

22     BY MR. WALKER:

23         Q.   Lines 9 through 11.

24         A.   Okay.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=762
25        Q.   Question -- by the way, I don't mean to leave 4054

1     this out. The Denton trial, you were under oath,

2     right?

3         A.   That's right.

4         Q.   Talking to jurors just like these?

5         A.   Yep.

6         Q.   With the court reporter, right?

7         A.   Same answers as I've given 30 times before.

8         Q.   Maybe so. Let's see. Question, you believe

9     that the smoker is fully responsible for making the

10     choice to quit, yes or no? Answer, yes, making the

11      quit attempt.

12              Did I read that correctly?

13         A.   Yes, sir.

14              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, those are all the

15         questions I have.

16              MR. UITERWYK: I'll object. Move to strike.

17         This is not what the answer is. Improper

18         impeachment.

19              THE COURT: Overruled.

20              MR. WALKER: Thank you, Your Honor. Thank

21          you, Dr. Cummings.

22              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

23              THE COURT: Mr. Pedrosa?

24              MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, if I could have a

25         couple minutes to swap places, bring some 4055

1         materials up and also to approach with counsel,

2         that would be great?

3              THE COURT: Okay. If you wish to stand in

4         place, please feel free to do so.

5              Mr. Uiterwyk?

6              (At sidebar.)

7              THE COURT: New personnel?

8              MR. PEDROSA: Yes, they're just helping me

9         with the transcripts.

10              THE COURT: Okay.

11               MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, I'm prepared to go

12         and I'm prepared to finish by the end of the day

13         if I have to and try to give you -- Mr. Uiterwyk

14         some time. But I think I'm entitled to know for

15         certain that we're not bringing Mr. Cummings --

16         Dr. Cummings back tomorrow.

17              THE COURT: We're going to go as long as I

18         tell you to go. I'm not making any commitment.

19         We're going to go as long as I tell you to go.

20              MR. PEDROSA: Okay. I just want to make sure

21          that if I speed up --

22              THE COURT: I haven't pressed anybody. We're

23         going to go as long as I tell you to go.

24              MR. PEDROSA: Okay. Thank you, Your Honor.

25              THE COURT: That's all I'm going to state. 4056

1              MR. PEDROSA: Okay. Thank you.

2              (Sidebar concluded.)

3              THE COURT: You may be seated.

4                        CROSS-EXAMINATION

5     BY MR. PEDROSA:

6         Q.   All right. Good afternoon, Dr. Cummings. I

7     guess at this point, I have to say, Good evening?

8         A.   Yes, you do.

9         Q.   Then I will. Good evening, Dr. Cummings.

10         A.   Good evening.

11          Q.   First of all, my name is Eliot Pedrosa. I

12     represent Lorillard. I want to start by asking you

13     some questions about this book of cigarette ads. And

14     I'm actually not going to ask you questions about the

15     ads that are in the book. I want to ask you about

16     what's not in the book.

17         A.   Okay.

18         Q.   There are no ads at all in this book from the

19      1980s, right?

20         A.   From the '80s, no. I think the last ad is

21      '76.

22         Q.   There are no ads at all in the book from the

23      1990s, right?

24         A.   Correct.

25         Q.   Now, you discussed with Mr. Walker, during 4057

1     his cross-examination, the warnings that -- the Surgeon

2     General warnings that appeared on cigarette packs and

3     on advertisements, right?

4         A.   Yes, I did.

5         Q.   And I would like to display those again if we

6     could. They've already been displayed once.

7              And this doesn't include the warning from

8      1966, right? It's just the warnings from '70 on?

9         A.   Correct.

10         Q.   Correct? Any cigarette ads that appeared in

11      magazines or newspapers in this country during the

12      1980s or the 1990s would have had one of these warnings

13     on them, right?

14         A.   Print ads or billboards, yes.

15         Q.   Print ads, billboards, newspaper or magazine,

16     correct?

17         A.   Right.

18         Q.   There were no TV ads during that time because

19     they had been banned, correct? '80s and '90s?

20         A.   No formal TV ads. There was still

21      advertising that occurred with product placements.

22         Q.   That's actually the next thing that I want to

23     ask you about. No radio ads, either? Formal radio

24     ads, as you said, right?

25         A.   That's right. 4058

1          Q.   Now, in the first half of the '80s, the

2     warning that would have appeared on all print

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=764
3     advertisements and billboards was the first one at the

4     top there, right? Warning, the Surgeon General has

5     determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your

6     health?

7         A.   Right.

8         Q.   And then the second half of the '80s, and the

9     first few years of the '90s, that we've been talking

10     about in this case, the warnings that would have

11      appeared are the four rotating warnings that we've

12     talked about already?

13         A.   That's right. They rotated.

14         Q.   Now, you talked about a concept called

15     product placement. And in your direct testimony you

16     gave the jury an example, and you talked about Marlboro

17     cigarettes appearing in the movie Superman?

18         A.   That's right.

19         Q.   And now, I know you didn't mean to imply

20     this, but just for the sake of everyone being on the

21      same page, you know Lorillard doesn't make Marlboro

22     cigarettes, right?

23         A.   No.

24         Q.   And neither does Reynolds?

25         A.   No. 4059

1          Q.   Now, you're aware that Lorillard adopted a

2     policy at some point in the early 1970s or earlier of

3     actually refusing requests by producers of motion

4     pictures to use Lorillard brand products in films,

5     right?

6         A.   I'm aware of that.

7         Q.   At that time in the early 1970s, there was no

8     law or regulation that prohibited product placement in

9     motion pictures, correct?

10         A.   True.

11          Q.   So Lorillard's policy at that time was a

12     voluntary policy?

13         A.   Correct.

14         Q.   You've actually seen documents from the

15      1970s, '80s, and '90s, where Lorillard is saying to a

16     producer of a movie, Our policy is not to have our

17     products included in your film?

18         A.   Yes. Lorillard was different than the other

19     companies.

20         Q.   Okay. I just want to show you a couple of

21      examples of that. And to try to go as fast as we can,

22     I'll hand you both at once, if that's all right?

23         A.   That would be great.

24         Q.   For identification, I'll be handing you LOR

25     3388, and let's not pull that up just yet. And LOR 4060

1      3394.

2              MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, may I approach?

3              THE COURT: Yes.

4              THE WITNESS: Thank you.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=765
5     BY MR. PEDROSA:

6         Q.   Now, Dr. Cummings, you've seen both of these

7     documents before, right?

8         A.   I have.

9         Q.   And you've testified about them before,

10     right?

11          A.   Yes.

12         Q.   And these are part of the body of knowledge

13     and information that you base your opinions on in this

14     case and your testimony on in this case, right?

15         A.   I rely on all the materials I've been able to

16     review.

17         Q.   Including these?

18         A.   Sure.

19              MR. PEDROSA: I would like to display these,

20         if I could, Judge, starting with LOR 3388.

21               THE COURT: Any objection?

22              MR. UITERWYK: No objection, Your Honor.

23              THE COURT: All right.

24     BY MR. PEDROSA:

25         Q.   Okay. Dr. Cummings, this is a letter, and 4061

1     the date at the top of the letter is March 23rd, 1973,

2     right?

3         A.   Yes.

4         Q.   And it is addressed to Milton Scott at a

5     company called United Visuals Corporation out in

6     California?

7         A.   Correct.

8         Q.   And if we take a look at the second page,

9     we'll see that it is letters coming from -- actually

10     let's look at the name at the bottom. Letters coming

11      from Curtis Judge, at Lorillard?

12         A.   That's right.

13         Q.   You know that Mr. Judge was at one point the

14     president of Lorillard?

15         A.   Correct. He was also, I think, a lawyer as

16     well.

17         Q.   At a different time?

18         A.   That's right.

19         Q.   And what Mr. Judge says in this letter to

20     United Visuals is that, "Lorillard has absolutely no

21      interest in sponsoring or in any way fostering directly

22     or indirectly the use of our tobacco products in any

23     films. Furthermore, we emphatically prefer that they

24     not be used." Is that right?

25         A.   That's right. 4062

1          Q.   Let's take a look at LOR 3394. And by the

2     way, you've also seen -- I've given you an example from

3     the '70s, an example from the '90s. You've seen one

4     from the '80s as well, right?

5         A.   I don't know. I've seen many documents. I

6     know Lorillard didn't do product placement, they did

7     other things like free sampling and other things.

8              MR. PEDROSA: Move to strike as

9         nonresponsive, Your Honor.

10              THE COURT: Sustained.

11      BY MR. PEDROSA:

12         Q.   Dr. Cummings, you would agree that from

13     whenever this policy was adopted at least as early as

14      1970s, Lorillard continued to adhere to its policy

15     against product placement, right?

16         A.   That's right.

17         Q.   In 1996, we see another example here. This

18     letter is dated June 5th, 1996?

19         A.   That's correct.

20         Q.   And it's from a gentleman named George

21      Telford who is the vice president of advertising and

22     brand management at Lorillard?

23         A.   That's right.

24         Q.   And he's writing to a woman named Celerie

25     Kemble at a company called Miss America, Inc.? 4063

1         A.   Correct.

2         Q.   And what he says to her is that, "With

3     respect to your request for Lorillard to supply True

4     cigarettes for product placement in the movie

5     Ms. America, please be advised that it is longstanding

6     Lorillard policy not to authorize the use of its movies

7     in any films. Accordingly, we do not give consent or

8     permission for the use of the True brand name nor will

9     we supply True cigarettes for your project."

10              Did I read that correctly?

11          A.   You did read that correctly.

12         Q.   Thank you. Dr. Cummings, I want to switch

13     gears a little bit and ask you some questions about

14     Mrs. Loyd.

15         A.   Okay.

16         Q.   Now, you told the jury previously that your

17     understanding is that Mrs. Loyd smoked True cigarettes

18     during the years '91, '92, and '93; is that right?

19         A.   Yes, by my review of the evidence in the

20     case.

21          Q.   And that's from your review of the

22     depositions?

23         A.   No. There was also a questionnaire.

24         Q.   Okay. So it's your testimony it's based

25     solely on your review of the questionnaire? 4064

1         A.   No. My testimony is based on all the

2     information I've reviewed.

3         Q.   And that includes the depositions?

4         A.   Yes.

5         Q.   And one of the deposition transcripts you

6     already told us you read was the deposition of Alice

7     Loyd?

8         A.   That's correct.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=767
9         Q.   And now, Mr. and Mrs. Loyd met in 1991,

10     right?

11          A.   That's right.

12         Q.   And they became married in about February of

13     '92?

14         A.   Correct.

15         Q.   And so during those years, certainly from '92

16     to '93, until Mrs. Loyd quit, Mr. and Mrs. Loyd were

17     living together as man and wife, correct?

18         A.   Correct.

19         Q.   And you remember, don't you, that Alice Loyd

20     actually testified that True was one of several brands

21      that Mrs. Loyd was smoking during those years?

22         A.   That's right.

23         Q.   And you remember that Mr. Loyd testified that

24     she was smoking Benson & Hedges, for example?

25         A.   There were a variety of brands that were 4065

1     mentioned. And I think Benson & Hedges was one of

2     them.

3         Q.   That's also not a brand made by either

4     Lorillard or Reynolds, right?

5         A.   No, that's Philip Morris.

6         Q.   And you remember Mr. Loyd actually said that

7     he thought Benson & Hedges was her primary brand, the

8     one that she smoked more than any others?

9         A.   No. I'm not sure if I recall that. He may

10     have mentioned that, but I don't know.

11          Q.   Do you have any notes on that in your notes

12     from the deposition?

13         A.   I do. My notes in the deposition talk about

14     the primary brands being Camel, Winston, Kent, and

15     True. I recall a questionnaire. I believe it was

16     filled out by Mr. Loyd on --

17         Q.   Let me stop you. Because I didn't ask you

18     about a questionnaire, I'm asking about Mr. Loyd's

19     deposition. Do you have any notes of Mr. Loyd's

20     deposition about what he said the primary brand was

21      during the years he was married to her?

22         A.   No. No. I just have a list of brands.

23         Q.   Let me see if I can help you.

24              MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, may I approach?

25              THE COURT: Yes. 4066

1     BY MR. PEDROSA:

2         Q.   Dr. Cummings, if you'll look at page 27?

3         A.   Okay.

4         Q.   Line 8 through 12?

5         A.   All right.

6         Q.   Let me know once you're there.

7         A.   I'm there.

8         Q.   And tell me if that refreshes your

9     recollection that Mr. Loyd testified that Mrs. Loyd had

10     a primary brand, one that she smoked more than the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=768
11      others and that it was Benson & Hedges?

12         A.   Yes. It does refresh my memory.

13         Q.   And that's correct, right? He said primary

14     brand, the one that she smoked more than the others,

15     was Benson & Hedges?

16         A.   He talked about personally buying Benson &

17     Hedges as well as Trues, Eve, Salem and Doral and

18     Kents.

19         Q.   And I think you left out Virginia Slims?

20         A.   Did I leave that one out?

21          Q.   I don't know if it's on that page, but you

22     remember he also testified she smoked Virginia Slims?

23         A.   I recall there were quite a few brands

24     because he was asked about all the brands she may have

25     tried. 4067

1          Q.   All the brands during those few years when

2     they were together and she was still smoking, so '91 to

3     '93?

4         A.   Sure.

5         Q.   And you know that neither Lorillard nor

6     Reynolds makes either Virginia Slims or Eve, right?

7         A.   That's right.

8         Q.   Now, Dr. Cummings, I want to go back now and

9     ask you about the 1980s. You also remember from the

10     depositions in this case that there were a number of

11      different brands that Mrs. Loyd smoked in the 1980s,

12     right?

13         A.   That's right.

14         Q.   And you remember that those brands included

15     Virginia Slims, right?

16         A.   Yes.

17         Q.   AndL&M?

18         A.   Correct.

19         Q.   Right. And the Kent brands were among the

20     various brands that she smoked in the 1980s, right?

21          A.   Kent, Kent Lights and Kent Ills.

22         Q.   Among Virginia Slims and L&M and possibly

23     other brands, right?

24         A.   Yes, there were a number of brands mentioned.

25     I think Kent and Kent Ills were the predominant ones 4068

1     mentioned, as I recall from my review.

2         Q.   You mentioned a questionnaire. You're

3     talking about a questionnaire that Mrs. Loyd actually

4     filled out herself, right?

5         A.   Yes.

6         Q.   And you reviewed that questionnaire?

7         A.   I did.

8         Q.   This is a questionnaire that she filled out

9     in 2006, thereabouts?

10         A.   There's not a date on it.

11          Q.   There's not a date on it, but you're aware

12     that's approximately when she filled it out?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=769
13         A.   Yes, because the last entry of her medical

14     problems was 2005.

15         Q.   Right. Now --

16              MR. PEDROSA: Can I have the ELMO, please?

17     BY MR. PEDROSA:

18         Q.   This is a page from the page of that

19     questionnaire, one of the pages on the various

20     cigarette brands, right?

21          A.   Correct.

22         Q.   And on this page, this is -- the cigarette

23     brands are listed in alphabetical order, right?

24         A.   They are.

25         Q.   And there is a space there for Kent, right? 4069

1         A.   Yes, there is.

2         Q.   And there is a space there for Kent Golden

3     Lights, right?

4         A.   Correct.

5         Q.   But Mrs. Loyd didn't actually write down

6     anything for either of those brands, right?

7         A.   True.

8              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, could we

9         completely show the entire questionnaire regarding

10         brands? They've only shown one page.

11               THE COURT: Okay.

12     BY MR. PEDROSA:

13         Q.   This is the first part of the questionnaire,

14     right? There's no more brands there that she's left

15     blank?

16         A.   Right. And then six --1 think, page 6 has

17     got the other entries.

18         Q.   I showed you page 5, already, right?

19         A.   You did.

20         Q.   That's the one that has the blank spaces for

21      Kent and Kent Golden Light?

22         A.   That's right.

23         Q.   And I keep banging this microphone with my

24     paper. It's not intentional, I promise.

25              And then this is the rest of it, right? 4070

1         A.   That's right.

2         Q.   And on it she's listed True, right?

3         A.   Right. True, trying to cut down.

4         Q.   And she's listed Winston, right?

5         A.   Correct.

6         Q.   Dr. Cummings, you testified both on direct

7     and cross about Dr. Ernst Wynder, right?

8         A.   I did.

9         Q.   And you mentioned at one point you knew him

10     personally?

11          A.   That's true.

12         Q.   And he was a very famous and well respected

13     scientist on smoking and health issues, yes?

14         A.   Certainly, yes.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=770
15         Q.   He's the scientist that did the experiments

16     that you talked about that appeared in Life magazine

17     with the mice where they showed the pictures of the

18     mice with the tumors, right?

19         A.   Right.

20         Q.   And you're also familiar with another famous

21      scientist named Dietrich Hoffmann?

22         A.   Sure. Knew him too.

23         Q.   Another well respected scientist who studied

24     smoking and health issues?

25         A.   Yes, sir. 4071

1          Q.   You know that Dr. Hoffmann and Dr. Wynder

2     collaborated on a number of projects, right?

3         A.   Yeah, many of those 600 papers had them

4     together as co-authors.

5         Q.   And, in fact, you're familiar with the fact

6     that they collaborated on some research regarding

7     phenol, so phenol in cigarette smoke, right?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   Which is it, by the way? I've heard it both

10     ways.

11          A.   Phenol.

12         Q.   Phenols are a class of compound, right? It's

13     not just one chemical?

14         A.   That's right.

15         Q.   You're aware that the work that Dr. Wynder

16     and Dr. Hoffmann did on phenols was actually undertaken

17     in cooperation with Lorillard in that Lorillard helped

18     fund it, right?

19         A.   I was aware that Dr. Wynder did take money

20     from the companies occasionally, yeah.

21          Q.   And Lorillard helped fund that research that

22     he did on phenols with Dr. Hoffmann?

23         A.   True.

24         Q.   And you're also familiar with the work that

25     Lorillard did on reducing phenols in cigarette smoke 4072

1      and the fact that Lorillard actually developed a method

2     that eliminated about 90 percent of the phenols through

3     filtration, right?

4         A.   Are you talking about charcoal filters?

5         Q.   No, I'm talking about -- let me ask the

6     question again.

7         A.   No, I'm not.

8         Q.   You're not?

9         A.   I'm not -- I'm not picking up on what you're

10     referring to.

11          Q.   Do you remember testifying in a case called

12     Apostolou?

13         A.   Sure.

14         Q.   You testified at trial in that case, right?

15         A.   I did.

16         Q.   You sat in a witness box like this one?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=771
17         A.   I did.

18         Q.   There was a judge?

19         A.   There was a judge, court reporter.

20         Q.   Court reporter, jury?

21          A.   Yep.

22         Q.   That case was important, right?

23         A.   Sure. They're all important.

24         Q.   It was important for you to testify

25     truthfully and accurately? 4073

1         A.   Yes, sir.

2              MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, may I approach?

3              THE COURT: Yes.

4     BY MR. PEDROSA:

5         Q.   Dr. Cummings, I'm giving you actually two

6     volumes of your testimony, but my questions are going

7     to be in Volume 2. So I'm not even sure you'll ever

8     need Volume 1, but to save myself a trip, I'm giving it

9     to you.

10         A.   Okay.

11          Q.   I would like you to look at page 2822 of your

12     trial testimony in the Apostolou case.

13         A.   Sure.

14         Q.   And specifically Lines 7 through 15.

15         A.   Okay.

16         Q.   Let me know when you're there.

17              At Line 7. Question, are you familiar with

18     the work Lorillard did and the patents it obtained on

19     reducing phenols in cigarette smoke? Answer,

20     predominantly through filtration. I'm familiar with

21      some of those, yes.

22              Question, as a matter of fact, Lorillard

23     developed a method that eliminated roughly 90 percent

24     of phenols through filtration, right? Answer, yes.

25              Did I read that correctly? 4074

1              MR. UITERWYK: Would you read the next

2         question, too, please?

3     BY MR. PEDROSA:

4         Q.   Question, and they use that in commercial

5     cigarettes, right? Answer, that, I don't know.

6         A.   All right.

7         Q.   All right. Dr. Cummings, I want to switch

8     gears, again. I'm doing my best to get you out of here

9     this afternoon -- evening.

10              On direct examination with Mr. Uiterwyk, you

11      testified that in 2004, Lorillard and Reynolds both

12     stated publicly on their websites that smoking causes

13     diseases including cancer, right?

14         A.   That's right.

15         Q.   And you also said that they stated publicly

16     on their websites that cigarette smoking was addictive?

17         A.   That's right. I don't know about the

18     websites. I know that the 2004 was in reference to

19     another legal matter where they were asked to stipulate

20     certain facts.

21          Q.   Actually, you know that back in 2000,

22     Lorillard's CEO at the time acknowledged that smoking

23     causes cancer, right?

24         A.   I'm not familiar with that.

25         Q.   Okay. You don't remember that from your 4075

1      deposition in the Scott Mae case just back in August of

2     this year?

3         A.   No. Sorry.

4         Q.   Okay.

5              MR. PEDROSA: May I approach, Your Honor?

6              THE COURT: Yes, sir.

7              MR. UITERWYK: Would you give me the

8         abbreviated page?

9              THE COURT: You're asking for the Reader's

10         Digest version?

11               MR. UITERWYK: Yeah. Give me the abbreviated

12         one. Environmentally insensitive.

13              THE WITNESS: What page?

14     BY MR. PEDROSA:

15         Q.   Dr. Cummings, the testimony I would like to

16     point you to is at page 257, line 5. And it runs

17     through 257, line 9.

18         A.   All right.

19         Q.   "Question: So in 2000, Mr. Orlowski, the CEO

20     of Lorillard, said clearly, unequivocally, that

21      Lorillard's position was that smoking causes cancer and

22     other diseases; is that true?

23               "Answer: That's what he says."

24              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, if we could for

25         sake of completeness read page 256, please, start 4076

1         there, for rule of completeness.

2              MR. PEDROSA: No, Your Honor. I think we

3         need to come to sidebar for that.

4              THE COURT: Can I see it, please?

5              MR. PEDROSA: Yes, sir.

6              THE WITNESS: You want my copy? No? All

7         right.

8              (At sidebar.)

9              THE COURT: Just the page that you read and

10         the page that Mr. Uiterwyk wants.

11               MR. UITERWYK: Judge, I want it to start on

12         page 256.

13              MR. PEDROSA: Do you have it?

14              THE COURT: Starting what line?

15              MR. UITERWYK: Page--line 22.

16              MR. PEDROSA: Oh, just line 22?

17              MR. UITERWYK: No. Keep on going.

18              MR. PEDROSA: Yeah. Through line 4?

19              MR. UITERWYK: Yeah, part of the trial

20         transcript.

21               MR. PEDROSA: Oh, I don't have a problem with

22         that. I thought it was the whole page.

23              THE COURT: Okay. Okay.

24              (Sidebar concluded.)

25     BY MR. PEDROSA: 4077

1          Q.   All right. Dr. Cummings, the part that we've

2     agreed to read starts a few lines above the part that I

3     read. Page 256, line 22:  "Question: This is part of

4     the trial transcript and it's testimony of

5     Martin Orlowski.

6              "Answer: Okay.

7              "Question: And the questions are by

8     Mr. Ross. And you don't need to read this into the

9     record. Let me give you a chance to read this to

10     yourself.

11               "Okay. Are you ready?

12              "Answer: Yep.

13               "Question: So in 2000, Mr. Orlowski, the CEO

14     of Lorillard, said clearly and unequivocally that

15     Lorillard's position was that smoking causes cancer and

16     other diseases; is that true?

17               "Answer: That's what he says."

18              I read that correctly this time?

19         A.   Right. I was reading out of the deposition.

20         Q.   Right. And you read something similar out of

21      the deposition on the question of addiction, right, and

22     Mr. Orlowski made a similar statement then about

23     addiction?

24         A.   Right. And I was asked previously whether I

25     knew about Lorillard's position, and I said I wasn't as 4078

1     familiar with their position as I was about Philip

2     Morris and Liggett.

3         Q.   Okay. Thank you.

4              Now, you're familiar with Lorillard's web

5     page, right?

6         A.   I am.

7         Q.   You've been on it; you've surfed it; you've

8     seen it?

9         A.   Yes.

10         Q.   And as I said earlier on direct, you

11      testified about the fact that in 2004, there were

12     certain statements that were put up on the web page,

13     right?

14         A.   I'm not sure it was 2004 on their website.

15         Q.   At some point, they went on the website,

16     right?

17         A.   True. I'm familiar with the statements made

18     in 2004 on a legal matter.

19              MR. PEDROSA: Your Honor, may I approach?

20              THE COURT: Yes.

21               THE WITNESS: Thank you.

22     BY MR. PEDROSA:

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=774
23         Q.   Dr. Cummings, did I give you one that's

24     highlighted? You would see it on the first page.

25         A.   No. 4079

1          Q.   No?

2              MR. UITERWYK: Didn't give me one, either.

3              MR. PEDROSA: I didn't need to. But I need

4         to know which questions I want to ask.

5     BY MR. PEDROSA:

6         Q.   Dr. Cummings, what I've handed you for the

7     record for identification is a composite exhibit that

8     is composed of LOR 15890, 15889, and 16133. But I've

9     broken them up so that each page on a web page is

10     actually a separate tab.

11          A.   Okay.

12         Q.   Is that organization understandable?

13         A.   It is.

14         Q.   Perfect.

15              So you said you've reviewed Lorillard's web

16     page?

17         A.   Yes.

18         Q.   And at this point, it's part of the total mix

19     of information that you are aware of and that you take

20     into account in testifying in this case?

21          A.   Yes.

22              MR. PEDROSA: All right. I would like to

23         display what's behind tab 1, which is LOR 15890.

24              MR. UITERWYK: Objection, hearsay,

25         Your Honor; objection --4080

1              THE COURT: Okay. Come forward, please.

2              (At sidebar.)

3              THE COURT: I need to see the document.

4              MR. PEDROSA: Yes, sir. You can look at

5         mine, which is highlighted.

6              MR. UITERWYK: I couldn't say self-serving.

7              MR. PEDROSA: Judge, this is a concealment

8         case.

9              THE COURT: A what?

10              MR. PEDROSA: This is a concealment case.

11          Okay? The evidence of what disclosure the company

12         makes now, which Dr. Cummings has already given on

13         direct, is clearly relevant to the concealment

14         claim. It's not -- it's not that it's

15         self-serving. He's already testified that it's

16         there. This is just a visual representation of

17         what it is. And they've opened the door to it.

18              MR. UITERWYK: This is post 1999, Your Honor.

19              THE COURT: Well, was there evidence on

20         direct examination of -- of any bad acts that were

21          subsequent to 1999?

22              MR. UITERWYK: Not that I'm aware of. Not

23         that I recall.

24              THE COURT: Any facts regarding concealment

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=775
25        after 1999? 4081

1              MR. PEDROSA: Well, the witness has already

2         testified that after 1999, Lorillard disclosed

3         these things on its web page. So the door has

4         been opened to actually put it up and show what it

5         is. He's already testified about it.

6              MR. UITERWYK: That doesn't mean the door has

7         been opened. Doesn't mean it's opened to this

8         document.

9              MR. PEDROSA: Well, I'm not offering the

10         document right now. I just want to put up what

11          he's talking about. We'll deal with offering the

12         document when we get to my case.

13              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor--I'm sorry. Go

14         ahead.

15              THE COURT: I'll allow it.

16              MR. UITERWYK: I'm not going to argue with

17         you. But, Judge, this document -- never mind.

18              (Sidebar concluded.)

19              MR. PEDROSA: All right. Thank you,

20         Your Honor.

21               Can we bring that up, please?

22     BY MR. PEDROSA:

23         Q.   Now, this is a page on Lorillard's web page

24     that's entitled "Smoking and Health," right? That's

25     the heading? 4082

1         A.   That's right.

2         Q.   And I want to look at the --

3              THE COURT: Mr. Pedrosa, you need -- take it

4         down a minute. You need to have him authenticate

5         the document before you publish it.

6              MR. PEDROSA: Sure.

7     BY MR. PEDROSA:

8         Q.   Dr. Cummings, you're familiar with the

9     smoking and health page that appears as part of

10     Lorillard's web page, right?

11          A.   Not of every word. It changes frequently.

12     This one is dated 2011. I've seen variations over

13     time. So which one are you referring to?

14         Q.   You've seen versions of it over time, right?

15         A.   I have.

16         Q.   And take a look at the three bullet points

17     that appear at the top of that section under smoking

18     and health issues. You've seen those bullet points or

19     statements to those effect on there, haven't you?

20         A.   Yes, I have.

21          Q.   Okay.

22              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, with that document

23         dated May 27th, 2011, Ms. Loyd was -- well,

24         objecting to relevance.

25              THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection. 4083

1     BY MR. PEDROSA:

2         Q.   All right. Dr. Cummings, you're aware that

3     for some time, Lorillard's web page has contained a

4     statement that all cigarettes are dangerous, aren't

5     you?

6         A.   I don't know when they first started to make

7     that statement on their website. Their website for

8     consumers really are something relatively new.

9         Q.   But you remember that that statement is made

10     on Lorillard's web page, right, all cigarettes are

11      dangerous?

12         A.   Recently I've seen that, yes.

13         Q.   All right. And you're aware that Lorillard's

14     web page contains the statement that there is no safe

15     cigarette?

16         A.   Only recently.

17              MR. UITERWYK: Objection -- same objection,

18         Your Honor, move to strike, asking questions

19         regarding recent --

20              THE COURT: Sustained. Keep it before her

21          death, please.

22     BY MR. PEDROSA:

23         Q.   Dr. Cummings, take a look at tabs 2, 3, 4, 5,

24     6, and 7. And when you've had a moment to look at

25     those, just let me know. 4084

1         A.   Sure. Okay.

2         Q.   You're familiar with all of those or versions

3     of all of them as pages from Lorillard's website,

4     aren't you?

5         A.   Not during the time that Ms. Loyd was alive,

6     no, never.

7         Q.   In the work that you've done in the total

8     body of knowledge that you've collected to give your

9     opinions in these cases, you have reviewed those

10     website pages before, right?

11          A.   I've reviewed the recent web pages and

12     compared them to what Lorillard had said during the

13     time that Ms. Loyd was smoking and alive and --

14         Q.   My -- my --

15         A.   -- they differ greatly.

16              MR. PEDROSA: Move to strike as

17         nonresponsive.

18              THE COURT: Overruled.

19     BY MR. PEDROSA:

20         Q.   My question is simply, have you reviewed the

21      website pages?

22         A.   Recently, yes. They didn't exist until

23     relatively recently.

24         Q.   Dr. Cummings, I have just one or two more

25     questions for you. 4085

1         A.   Sure.

2              MR. PEDROSA: Can we display the warnings

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=777
3         again?

4     BY MR. PEDROSA:

5         Q.   Dr. Cummings, these are the same warnings we

6     looked at earlier, right?

7         A.   Yes.

8         Q.   Those warnings don't change by brand, do

9     they?

10         A.   No.

11          Q.   Same warnings that appear on an ad for

12     Winston are the same warnings that appear on an ad for

13     Kent?

14         A.   True.

15         Q.   And True?

16         A.   True to True.

17         Q.   And you already told us that these are those

18     warnings?

19         A.   Yes.

20         Q.   Same warnings that appear on pack of Winstons

21      are the same warnings that appear on a pack of Kent,

22     right?

23         A.   Yes.

24         Q.   And True?

25         A.   That's correct. 4086

1          Q.   And every other brand of cigarettes that

2     Mrs. Loyd was smoking in the 1980s and 1990s, right?

3         A.   Every other U.S. brand, yes.

4              MR. PEDROSA: Dr. Cummings, I don't have any

5         more questions for you. Thank you very much.

6              THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Pedrosa.

7              Counsel approach, please.

8              (At sidebar.)

9              THE COURT: Mr. Uiterwyk, do you want any

10         additional time to redirect?

11               MR. UITERWYK: In five minutes?

12              THE COURT: Pardon me?

13              MR. UITERWYK: In five minutes, you mean,

14         Your Honor?

15              THE COURT: I'm not hearing. You want five

16         minutes?

17              MR. UITERWYK: No, no.

18              THE COURT: In five minutes?

19              MR. UITERWYK: No. What I'm saying is -

20              THE COURT: I gotcha. I'm willing to--1

21          told the jury --1 think I told the jury

22         approximately. I didn't paint a bright yellow

23         line. So if you want some additional time, I will

24         impose upon them, or I would issue an order

25         instanter for Dr. Cummings to come back tomorrow 4087

1         morning. But consistent with my prior ruling, I'm

2         not going to let you put on any redirect if you

3         don't do it now or tomorrow morning.

4              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, for me to put the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=778
5         redirect on at 6:30 at night after he's --

6              THE COURT: I'm willing to give you the

7         alternative. Those are the only two alternatives

8         you have.

9              MR. UITERWYK: Can I confer with my client?

10              THE COURT: Yes.

11               MR. UITERWYK: Can I have a few minutes,

12         Your Honor?

13              THE COURT: Yes.

14              (Sidebar concluded.)

15              THE COURT: Members of the jury, we'll just

16         take an in-your-chair break. So if you would like

17         to stand up and stretch, it will be just a minute

18         or two.

19              Approach, please.

20              (At sidebar.)

21               MR. UITERWYK: Reluctantly, I'm going to go

22         forward, Your Honor, only because reluctantly I'm

23         left with no other alternative. And I'm going to

24         go forward. I don't how long the Court is going

25         to allow me to go forward. 4088

1              THE COURT: How much time do you want?

2              MR. UITERWYK: You know, I can do this in

3         30 seconds but not really cover a lot. I can do

4         it in an hour, an hour and a half, and then cover

5         it decently. Or I can do it in a half an hour and

6         cover it -- pardon the expression -- half ass.

7         I'm caught in a bind, Judge. With all due

8         respect --

9              THE COURT: People say that and then the next

10         thing they do is disrespect me. But go ahead.

11               MR. UITERWYK: I asked the Court to allow me

12         to recall him for redirect after he's finished in

13         Fort Myers.

14              THE COURT: I know. But I've turned you down

15         three times.

16              MR. UITERWYK: Okay. I just need to ask it

17         again, Judge. It's 6:30 at night. So --

18              THE COURT: Okay. I understand that.

19              MR. UITERWYK: I'm tired and everybody's

20         tired.

21               THE COURT: I know. I know it's a difficult

22         choice, but I didn't make these decisions. I

23         didn't schedule him. And we've been through it.

24         So it's not -- it's -- we are where we are. So I

25         can ask the jury's indulgence for another 20 or 4089

1          30 minutes if you want or, as I said, I will issue

2         an order right now compelling the witness to

3         appear tomorrow morning.

4              MR. UITERWYK: All right, Judge. I'll just

5         go forward.

6              THE COURT: Sir?

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=779
7              MR. UITERWYK: I'll just go forward, do it as

8         quickly as I can.

9              THE COURT: All right.

10              (Sidebar concluded.)

11               THE COURT: Members of the jury, I told you

12         earlier it would be about 6:30. We're going to be

13         a little bit longer. So we appreciate your

14         patience.

15              Mr. Uiterwyk?

16              MR. UITERWYK: Thank you, Your Honor. May it

17         please the Court.

18                      REDIRECT EXAMINATION

19     BY MR. UITERWYK:

20         Q.   I have a little bit of redirect for you. We

21      don't have much time.

22              One of the things I want to show first, you

23     know, Mr. Walker talked about some of the documents

24     that maybe we didn't show. Did we show all documents

25     necessary to support your opinion? 4090

1         A.   Yes.

2         Q.   Were there any documents that you saw over

3     the last day and a half of direct testimony -- of your

4     cross-examination that changed any of your opinions in

5     any way?

6         A.   No. Only strengthened it, actually. The

7     Rodgman 1964 document summarizes what Dr. Rodgman said

8     in 1962. The evidence is overwhelming against smoking

9     and scant against -- in the other direction.

10         Q.   And before I get to the issue of some of

11      the -- of some of your opinions and whether any of the

12     things that they brought up changed in any way, do you

13     remember the Harry Reasoner CBS clip that we played?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   And do you remember part of it being played

16     before the -- showing the pictures of what was going on

17     and so forth regarding the Surgeon General report and

18     so forth?

19         A.   I do.

20         Q.   And do you remember at that time I asked for

21      the rule of completeness that we show the whole clip?

22         A.   Yes.

23         Q.   And is there a portion of the clip which they

24     cut out that is very important --

25         A.   Yes. 4091

1          Q.   -- in connection with the examination of that

2     clip?

3         A.   Yes, there is.

4         Q.   All right. If we could, please, could we

5     play the entire clip so the jury has the benefit to see

6     what they did not show them?

7         A.   That would be fine.

8         Q.   This is -- sort of background again to remind

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=780
9     you because it was a day and a half of

10     cross-examination, this was in -- when was this?

11          A.   1964.

12         Q.   Following the Surgeon General report?

13         A.   Yes.

14              MR. UITERWYK: If we could, please.

15              (Clip published to the jury as follows:)

16              "About $170 million a year is spent to

17         advertise cigarettes in all possible ways,

18         including radio and television. So any news which

19         seems likely to affect smoking habits is major

20         news for the country as a whole, for the citizen

21          as an individual. So far in the developing

22         concern about smoking and health, the national

23         reaction has been to keep smoking.

24              "It has been noted that today's report is the

25         culmination of great many studies and great deal 4092

1          of concern. It is as close as we can come in this

2         country to an official and impartial statement of

3         the facts, but it is also a beginning rather than

4         an end. What happens now is the process of

5         decision on what to do about it by government

6         agencies, by the tobacco industry, by advertising

7         media, newspapers and magazines, radio and

8         television. CBS announced today that it is

9         undertaking an immediate study of the report and

10         will reexamine its advertising standards in light

11          of the findings. ABC and NBC made similar

12         statements. In addition, CBS through its

13         representative on the Television Code Review Board

14         will participate in a study of industry standards

15         later this month.

16              "Above all, every American who smokes and

17         every American youngster who is thinking of

18         smoking, must now consider whether to stop or not

19         to start. It comes down to a subjective question.

20         There is no question but that smoking has meant a

21          great deal to a great many people. An old smoker

22         never forgets how he started and through the

23         lifetimes of a lot of us, cigarettes have been an

24         intimate and reassuring companion. The familiar

25         slogans, the familiar packages have been a part of 4093

1          our lives. It's like being told that an old

2         friend has all along been betraying you. In a

3         case like that, you give the old friend every

4         possible chance before you finally decide to

5         believe what you have been told, and maybe even

6         then you give him a chance to reform.

7              "In this kind of a country, it comes down to

8         you, whether you like it or not. No one is going

9         to forbid an adult to smoke, and it is now quite

10         clear that no one is going to tell him it's good

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=781
11          for him either. The decision is his. The

12         decision and the health that may depend on it.

13               "This is Harry Reasoner. Good night."

14     BY MR. UITERWYK:

15         Q.   Now, at this time, they also showed you a

16     number of documents as well before this played with

17     regard to smoking and health and what people said with

18     regard to the issue of addiction, what people said with

19     regard to the issue of the health effects of smoking.

20              Do you recall those documents?

21          A.   Yes.

22         Q.   And do you recall some documents that were as

23     old as 50 years, 60 years ago or more, I mean, 80 or 90

24     years? And do you also recall some documents that were

25     done in the '50s with respect to whether or not smoking 4094

1      caused lung cancer and other health effects? And there

2     were some talking about scientists who felt that it had

3     not been shown yet, had not been caused including

4     Dr. Hammond, I believe was one, and Dr. Huber. Did I

5     pronounce it right?

6         A.   Huber.

7         Q.   And others at that time. Do you recall that?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   Now, first of all, did any of those documents

10     change your opinion in any way regarding the extent of

11      the concealment, the conspiracy, the cover-up that

12     these cigarette companies did from that period, 1950s

13     on to the 1990s?

14         A.   No, not at all.

15         Q.   Why not?

16         A.   Because the evidence is very clear that the

17     companies internally knew that their products caused

18     cancer early on. By 1958, there was no debate really

19     within the industry whether cigarette smoking caused

20     cancer. And the companies told the consumers from that

21      50-year period that their products, you know, were safe

22     to use or essentially not proven to be harmful. And

23     actually up through 1964, they said their products were

24     not injurious to health. That was what they said. And

25     if there were anything ever found harmful, they would 4095

1     take it out. They knew there was harmful things in

2     there. They knew they couldn't take it out. That was

3     a frank lie. And they lied to the American public

4     about the health risks that they knew about, the

5     addictiveness, how their products were engineered to be

6     addictive. So that was the conspiracy.

7         Q.   And how long did that conspiracy last?

8         A.   That conspiracy lasted right up really until

9     their internal records became available in the late

10      1990s. One of the companies, Liggett Meyers, their CEO

11      was the first to admit that they knew that their

12     products were harmful and addictive.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=782
13              Philip Morris changed their website in 2000.

14     And as I said, maybe there was testimony that I wasn't

15     aware of from Lorillard, but their -- their

16     designations in legal proceedings changed in 2004.

17         Q.   And then there was an issue with regard to

18     filtered cigarettes. Do you recall that?

19         A.   Yes.

20         Q.   Talking about filtered cigarettes versus what

21      was known, what was being said, and then what really

22     they found out to be true. Do you recall that?

23         A.   Yes.

24         Q.   And do you recall, I believe, in the 1981

25     Surgeon General report where they talked about filtered 4096

1      cigarettes and the issue of whether filtered

2     cigarettes -- I've reviewed the question again in far

3     greater depth than before. "Overall our judgment is

4     unchanged from '66 to 79. Smokers who are unwilling

5     or as yet unable to quit are well-advised to switch to

6     cigarettes yielding less tar and nicotine, provided

7     they do not increase their smoking or change their

8     smoking in other ways."

9              Do you recall that?

10         A.   That's right.

11          Q.   And what did the Surgeon General say in 2004,

12     Dr. Cummings?

13         A.   There was no evidence really that switching

14     to --

15              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor, hearsay,

16         relevance, beyond the scope.

17              THE COURT: Overruled.

18              You may answer.

19              THE WITNESS: Sure. This was the conclusion

20         in 2000 report -- '4 report.  "Smoking cigarettes

21          with low machine-measured yields of tar and

22         nicotine provides no clear benefit to health."

23     BY MR. UITERWYK:

24         Q.   As a matter of fact, you mentioned -- they

25     can't even advertise light cigarettes anymore, can 4097

1     they?

2         A.   No, they cannot.

3         Q.   What happened between 1981 and 2004 that

4     there was this change by the Surgeon General, that

5     caused this change?

6         A.   Well, the evidence that -- there was two

7     things that can't -- happened. One is the population

8     of people who had switched to these low yield

9     cigarettes had aged to a point where they -- where

10     there was mortality, and the studies became more

11      complete. And it wasn't based on the early group that

12     had switched over, the more health concerned group that

13     obviously had different -- other habits. And when you

14     looked at the full cohorts, the evidence indicates the

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=783
15     relative risk actually went up, indicating the products

16     were probably more dangerous probably because of deeper

17     inhalation.

18              Secondly, the internal business records of

19     the companies became available to see that their own

20     internal studies showed that people changed how they

21      smoked the cigarettes because of the little lasered

22     invisible vent holes that were put into the filter that

23     allowed people to take bigger, deeper puffs. So it

24     wasn't just the number of cigarettes that people would

25     smoke that would make a difference; it was the total 4098

1     volume. And they could smoke the same number of

2     cigarettes, but there were imperceptible changes that

3     people would have in how they smoked those cigarettes

4     because of those vent holes that allowed them to get

5     the same dose or even a greater dose of the tar and

6     nicotine than they had been getting from the previous

7     cigarettes.

8         Q.   And these were -- this information was

9     disclosed with the internal documents that were kept

10     secret until that time?

11          A.   Yes, sir.

12         Q.   All right. Now, in 1966, what did the

13     cigarette companies call their cigarette? Do you

14     recall a statement by one of the companies with regard

15     to -- first of all, what is this document we have here?

16         A.   This was --

17              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, may I ask that the

18         document be removed until it's properly

19         identified?

20              MR. UITERWYK: It's in evidence. It's in

21          evidence.

22              MR. WALKER: It still hasn't been identified,

23         Judge.

24              THE COURT: Okay. Overruled. If it's in

25         evidence. 4099

1     BY MR. UITERWYK:

2         Q.   It's PT 3678. And are you familiar with this

3     document?

4         A.   Yes. It's authored by Myron Johnston from

5     Philip Morris to Bill Dunn and copied to two senior

6     scientists, Helmut Wakeham and Dr. Seligman at Philip

7     Morris.

8         Q.   People who were involved in the TIRC,

9     T-I-R-C?

10         A.   Yes, sir.

11          Q.   What did they say at that time?

12         A.   Well, these are their -- some of their

13     conclusions with regards to their market study on the

14     safer cigarette. And they said, "The illusion of

15     filtration is as important as the fact of filtration,

16     that advertising should be directed to both sexes but

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=784
17     in such a way as to have a greater appeal to women,

18     because women were more attracted to these filtered and

19     lower yield cigarettes."

20         Q.   A couple of -- few other things, because I

21     know it is getting late. There's a couple of things I

22     just want to cover that may cover some other issues at

23     the same time.

24              Do you recall yesterday about the 1972

25     Surgeon General report and the press release, 25883, 4100

1     that there was a press release issued?

2         A.   Yes.

3         Q.   And counsel, Mr. Walker, asked whether any of

4     the press releases had ever been published. Do you

5     remember that?

6         A.   Yes.

7         Q.   And also at the same time, he mentioned about

8     statements that Dr. Horan (sic) made during that period

9     of time as well?

10         A.   Yes.

11          Q.   And is Daniel Horan, director of the National

12     Clearinghouse on Smoking?

13         A.   Daniel Horn.

14         Q.   Horn. Sorry. I said Horan. Horn. It is

15     late.

16              MR. UITERWYK: The first thing I want to

17         publish, please, 2583A if we could, please.

18              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, I would like to

19         receive a copy.

20              MR. UITERWYK: I've got a copy here for you.

21          Sorry. I'm trying to get through it quick.

22              MR. PEDROSA: Thank you.

23              MR. UITERWYK: Go to the ELMO, please.

24     BY MR. UITERWYK:

25         Q.   This is January 11, 1972? 4101

1         A.   Correct.

2         Q.   Have you seen this document before?

3         A.   I have.

4         Q.   And this is -- the first part of it is a 

5              MR. UITERWYK: Could I have the -- you're

6         going to show it? Let's go to the bottom right.

7              MR. WALKER: May we have the newspaper

8         identified?

9              MR. UITERWYK: I will.

10     BY MR. UITERWYK:

11          Q.   Which newspaper is it?

12         A.   The Greensboro Daily News.

13         Q.   What date is it?

14         A.   January 11th, 1972.

15         Q.   And is that one day after the issuance of the

16     Surgeon General report?

17         A.   It's on the day of the report.

18         Q.   Okay. And this was the front page of that

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=785
19     newspaper?

20         A.   Correct.

21          Q.   And does it refer to the press release that

22     was issued by the Tobacco Institute?

23         A.   Yes. You can see William Kloepfer, he was

24     the author of the press release.

25         Q.   And in no -- it says that the report is in no 4102

1     way objective, took exception to the Surgeon General's

2     statement that there is no honest disagreement among

3     experts about the terrible effects of smoking. The

4     statement is false. It is a gross insult to the

5     scientific community. It ignores the work of

6     researchers cited in the report. Kloepfer accused the

7     attorney general --

8         A.   Surgeon General.

9         Q.    Surgeon General Jesse Steinfeld of

10     submitting the report for review only to those persons

11     known to share his opinion of smoking. He said

12     Steinfeld was just as careful not to submit the report

13     to any of the many scientific experts who disagree with

14     it.

15              In 1964, was there any disagreement among

16     those scientists with regard to smoking and health and

17     lung cancer?

18         A.   No.

19         Q.   And when people would hear -- who were

20     addicted to cigarettes during this time like

21      Jackie Loyd, would hear statements, they would hear

22     from the Surgeon General about smoking causes lung

23     cancer and then that same day they hear from the

24     industry, well, no, it doesn't, we don't know, and they

25     hear all these clips that we saw on direct and they 4103

1     hear that, what effect does it have on people -- and

2     what effect did it have on people like Jackie Loyd?

3              MR. WALKER: Objection, Your Honor,

4         speculation as to Mrs. Loyd.

5              THE COURT: Overruled.

6     BY MR. UITERWYK:

7         Q.   Go ahead.

8         A.   It has the effect of basically diluting the

9     health message and gives smokers a psychological crutch

10     and self-rationale to keep puffing on a cigarette. So

11      that was what it was intended to do.

12         Q.   And then did also at the time they talk about

13     what -- in another article right next to it, do they

14     talk about Daniel Horn as well?

15         A.   Yes, they do.

16         Q.   And do they talk about Mr. Steinfeld said

17     with regard to the Surgeon General report and so forth

18     and how many people have quit?

19         A.   Yes. He said, Dr. Horn, Over half of the

20     people who smoke today have tried to quit.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=786
21          Q.   Hold on. Was there a reporter who asked,

22     "Shouldn't a person have the right to destroy himself

23     if he wants to?"

24         A.   Yes.

25         Q.   And what does Dr. Horn answer? 4104

1         A.   He said, "Over half of the people who smoke

2     today have tried to quit and failed, so shatteringly

3     that they have vowed never to try again. So these are

4     people who have lost their right not to smoke. It's a

5     vicious habit."

6         Q.   And do you agree with that term that these

7     are people who have lost their right not to smoke?

8         A.   Yes.

9         Q.   What caused them to lose their right not to

10     smoke?

11          A.   They got addicted to cigarettes that were

12     engineered to get them so they would keep buying

13     cigarettes over and over again, put money in the

14     cigarette company's pockets.

15         Q.   And I want to touch base on a few other

16     things in here which Steinfeld -- Steinfeld, the

17     Surgeon General, said with regard to smoking.

18              MR. UITERWYK: If we could go to the top

19         part, right here, the first highlighted right

20         there. I have it. Let's switch over to here.

21      BY MR. UITERWYK:

22         Q.   Still Steinfeld said, "Although 29 million

23     Americans have stopped smoking in the seven years since

24     the Surgeon General's office pinpointed the smoking

25     health link, 44 million Americans continue to smoke." 4105

1              And why do 44 million Americans continue to

2     smoke?

3         A.   Because they're addicted to cigarettes.

4         Q.   Then he goes on to say, "Steinfeld offered

5     several reasons for cigarette smoking's comeback in

6      1971 after several years of declining consumption."

7              Was there a period of time that consumption

8     went down?

9         A.   Yes.

10         Q.   When?

11          A.   I call it the Fairness Doctrine between 1968

12     and 1970. Basically the television stations were

13     required to run public service ads in sufficient

14     amounts; for every cigarette ad, you were supposed to

15     get an anti-smoking ad. It didn't quite work out that

16     way. It was about four cigarette ads to every one

17     anti-smoking ad. But that actually had an effect on

18     informing the American public and smoking rates

19     declined dramatically, although they rebounded because

20     people were addicted and they relapsed. And those ads

21      went off of television when they removed cigarette

22     advertising off of TV and radio.

23         Q.   We also talked about additives as well. And

24     you testified on direct about additives.

25         A.   Yes. 4106

1          Q.   Are you familiar with recent studies as it

2     relates to additives?

3         A.   Yes.

4         Q.   Can you tell the jury about what recent

5     studies have found that what additives have done

6     regarding the relative risk of people dying from

7     smoking cigarettes?

8              MR. WALKER: Objection as to time period,

9         Your Honor.

10              THE COURT: Sustained.

11      BY MR. UITERWYK:

12         Q.   Are you familiar -- well, we talked about

13     additives, correct?

14         A.   Yes.

15         Q.   And do the cigarette companies disclose

16     what's in their filters?

17         A.   Do they disclose what's in their filters?

18         Q.   Yes.

19         A.   Not precisely. I mean, they provide

20     information on their website today about ingredients

21      that are added to cigarettes.

22         Q.   Let's talk about prior to -- let's talk about

23      19- -- prior to 1993.

24              What, if anything, did the cigarette

25     companies disclose regarding the ingredients in their 4107

1     products?

2         A.   They were required beginning in 1985 to

3     submit a list to the Department of Health, Education,

4     and Welfare about the ingredients that are used, not by

5     brand, just by list. And that list was to be kept

6     under lock and key and only available to four people in

7     the federal government.

8         Q.   So was that list available to anybody in the

9     public as to what ingredients were in their products?

10         A.   No.

11          Q.   Could anybody in the public look at this

12     list?

13              MR. WALKER: Objection, asked and answered.

14              THE COURT: Sustained.

15              THE WITNESS: Other than the four people that

16         had access to it, they were not allowed to divulge

17         it.

18              MR. WALKER: I thought you sustained the

19         objection.

20              THE COURT: I sustained the objection.

21               THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.

22              THE COURT: That's okay.

23     BY MR. UITERWYK:

24         Q.   Did they put their list anywhere on any of

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=788
25     their packages? Did they provide any ingredients on 4108

1      any of their packages or advertising or anything of

2     that nature?

3         A.   No.

4         Q.   Did anything you saw -- did anything you

5     heard from Mr. Walker or Mr. Pedrosa change your

6     opinion that Jackie Loyd was addicted to cigarettes

7     containing nicotine?

8         A.   No.

9         Q.   When was she addicted and how long was she

10     addicted -- strike that.

11              Was she addicted up until the time of her

12     death?

13         A.   Yes.

14         Q.   Why, if she quit in'93?

15         A.   Sure.

16              MR. WALKER: Objection, beyond the scope of

17         cross.

18              THE COURT: Overruled.

19              THE WITNESS: Drug addicts overcome

20         addiction. That doesn't mean that they're cured.

21          You're always -- once addicted, you're always

22         addicted. And so that's why I would say she was

23         still addicted even when she passed away after she

24         quit smoking.

25     BY MR. UITERWYK: 4109

1          Q.   Just because you quit, does that mean you're

2     no longer addicted?

3         A.   No, not at all.

4         Q.   Just because you quit, does it mean -- strike

5     that.

6              If we have choice over here and we have

7     addiction over here, does choice play any part as to

8     whether somebody is -- whether or not they're addicted?

9         A.   No. Addiction has to do with biology. And

10     choice -- certainly people have a choice to try to quit

11      smoking, but their ability to sustain staying off is

12     affected by whether they're addicted and how strongly

13     they're addicted.

14         Q.   So on the question of whether or not

15     Jackie Loyd was addicted to cigarettes containing

16     nicotine, does choice play a part in the answer to that

17     question?

18         A.   No.

19         Q.   Why not?

20         A.   Because it's biological. It's physical.

21      It's change in the brain. The drug has altered the

22     structure and function of the brain.

23              MR. UITERWYK: I said I would do it in

24         20 minutes, and I did. No further questions.

25              THE COURT: All right. Members of the jury, 4110

1         if you have any questions, now is the time under

2         the procedure that I've outlined several days ago.

3              Do any of you have any questions?

4              Thank you for your patience and your

5         indulgence. We'll be in recess until tomorrow

6         morning at nine o'clock. Bear in mind my

7         instructions to keep an open mind. Do not discuss

8         this case with anyone or communicate with anyone

9         about this case whatsoever in any manner or means.

10         And do not allow the case to be discussed in your

11         presence.

12              Thank you. Have a good night. We'll see you

13         tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. Leave your notes on your

14         chairs, please.

15              THE BAILIFF: All rise.

16              (Jury exited the courtroom at 6:52 p.m.)

17              THE COURT: Dr. Cummings, you're excused.

18         You have a lot of materials on your desk there, on

19         the bench. Please remove any of the materials

20         that you brought with you.

21               THE WITNESS: I have done that.

22              THE COURT: Okay.

23              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, in connection --

24         while the witness is still here, in connection

25         with this witness's testimony for the last day and 4111

1          a half, I want to offer and introduce into

2         evidence every item that was marked and shown to

3         the witness and offer it into evidence. I have

4         not identified the numbers yet.

5              THE COURT: The demonstrative exhibits shown

6         on cross-examination?

7              MR. UITERWYK: Not the demonstratives, the

8         exhibits, the actual documents, the actual

9         articles and the actual --

10              THE COURT: Okay. Well --

11               MR. WALKER: If they give us a list, Judge,

12         we'll look at it.

13              THE COURT: Yeah. Go through a list with

14         counsel and --1 mean, I don't know which exhibits

15         you're referring to.

16              MR. UITERWYK: All of defendant's exhibits.

17              THE COURT: All of defendant's exhibits?

18              MR. UITERWYK: You bet.

19              THE COURT: Excluding -- you want to admit

20         defendant's exhibits in your case?

21               MR. UITERWYK: Correct.

22              MR. WALKER: I just need to see a list of

23         what he's referring to.

24              MR. UITERWYK: All the exhibits you used in

25         your cross-examination. 4112

1              THE COURT: Other than demonstrative aids.

2              MR. UITERWYK: Correct.

3              THE COURT: Well, I don't know which --1

4         don't know -- do you have any objection to that?

5              MR. WALKER: I might. I need to look at it

6         and see. I'm certainly not in a position to

7         address that right now.

8              THE COURT: Okay.

9              MR. BIGGER: Judge, we obviously don't have a

10         list. They have a list of what exhibits they used

11          on cross. They could provide us with the exhibit

12         numbers, because I don't know what they were.

13         They weren't identified for the record. So I

14         don't know what they were. But they do.

15              THE COURT: Well, counsel need to get

16         together and --

17              MR. WALKER: Sure, Your Honor. I gave them a

18         copy of everything I used. I just -- some of them

19         might be fine. Some may not. I don't know.

20              THE COURT: Okay. All right. Anything else?

21               MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

22              MR. UITERWYK: Go ahead.

23              MR. WALKER: I asked Mr. Uiterwyk a few times

24         today and haven't gotten an answer about the

25         witness list. 4113

1              THE COURT: Can the witness be excused?

2              MR. WALKER: Yes, Your Honor.

3              THE COURT: You're excused.

4              MR. WALKER: I've been asking for the witness

5         disclosure for tomorrow and I haven't gotten an

6         answer. I'm hoping I can get one now.

7              MR. UITERWYK: He can get one now. We just

8         realized now what we're going to do today. We

9         didn't know.

10              MR. WALKER: I'm not casting stones. I just

11          want a disclosure for tomorrow.

12              MR. TRENTALANGE: Right. Tomorrow, assuming

13         either -- assuming I can not tell Mr. Tanvetyanon

14         that once he comes in the courtroom, he'll never

15         leave, he'll probably come as the first witness.

16              THE COURT: Dr. -

17              MR. TRENTALANGE: Dr. Tanvetyanon is his

18         name. He goes by Dr. Tan for brevity. He will be

19         our first witness.

20              And then I don't know about the order, but we

21          had Jack Smith here today, and he'll return

22         tomorrow along with Amber Norris. And I have been

23         juggling another medical provider, Dr. Vasquez. I

24         don't know what his availability is. I'm going to

25         have to call him to find out. 4114

1              THE COURT: Okay.

2              MR. TRENTALANGE: So they know the remainder

3         of our witnesses.

4              MR. WALKER: All live witnesses. What are

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=791
5         the live witnesses?

6              MR. TRENTALANGE: For tomorrow? Well, you

7         know, with the live witnesses, I don't know,

8         because I don't know about Dr. Vasquez. We might

9         have to --

10              MR. WALKER: No, no. I mean other than the

11          ones that you've mentioned. Other live witnesses.

12              MR. TRENTALANGE: If there's time and we're

13         given a choice between resting or calling a

14         witness, we'll probably call Cindy Evers. And we

15         also have a corporate rep deposition I've told

16         them about to fill gaps. But those -- certainly

17         those three witnesses are going to be called

18         tomorrow, you know, if there's time.

19              THE COURT: Time permitting?

20              MR. TRENTALANGE: Time permitting, yes, sir.

21               THE COURT: Okay.

22              MR. TRENTALANGE: And Dr. Tanvetyanon will be

23         first.

24              MR. SEIDEN: We haven't gotten the exhibits

25         disclosed yet either. 4115

1              MR. TRENTALANGE: Right. Because I've been

2         here.

3              THE COURT: Okay. Well --

4              MR. TRENTALANGE: Dr. Tan, his exhibits will

5         be his medical records.

6              MR. SEIDEN: What about Dr. Vasquez?

7              MR. TRENTALANGE: His medical records. Other

8         than medical records, that will be it.

9              Then for the --

10              THE COURT: All of you may be seated, if you

11          wish. You can stand if you wish, too.

12              MR. UITERWYK: What I'm waiting on,

13         Your Honor, is the cut -- you know, you ruled --1

14         think it was yesterday morning -- the

15         deposition -- your objections -- your rulings on

16         the objections to the deposition of Dr. Robinson.

17         And since we may be playing that tomorrow, the

18         defendant Lorillard took it upon themselves to

19         provide us a cut. And we don't have it yet. And

20         we need to give it to Baron tonight so we can play

21          it tomorrow.

22              MR. PEDROSA: I understood from Mr. Uiterwyk

23         yesterday that he was going to be withdrawing some

24         parts of it. If you're not withdrawing anything,

25         we can have it here tomorrow for Baron. 4116

1              Judge, there are -- there were two sets of

2         pages where it looks like you might have grabbed

3         two pages at once when you turned the page,

4         because there are facing pages that have no

5         markings on them. You just didn't rule. So I

6         have those pages. I can give them to you, or I

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=792
7         can give you back the binder.

8              THE COURT: No.

9              MR. PEDROSA: Mr. Uiterwyk --

10              MR. UITERWYK: Are you going to bring the

11          video in tomorrow?

12              MR. PEDROSA: Yeah, we'll do that.

13              MR. UITERWYK: You can bring the video

14         tomorrow?

15              THE COURT: So there are a couple of

16         objections that I missed?

17              MR. PEDROSA: Yeah. Just page 291 and 292.

18         You just didn't write anything.

19              THE COURT: Okay.

20              MR. PEDROSA: And same thing for 405. And -

21               THE COURT: Let me take a look.

22              MR. PEDROSA: --406.

23              And the first one is a plaintiff designation

24         with a defense objection. The second one is a

25         defense designation with a plaintiff objection. 4117

1              MR. UITERWYK: You going to want me to do it

2         tomorrow?

3              THE COURT: Okay, Mr. Pedrosa.

4              MR. PEDROSA: Thank you, Your Honor.

5              MR. UITERWYK: Your Honor, just for the

6         record, I do want to offer in, which has been

7         identified and talked about today, the Surgeon

8         General report for 1981 that we're going to offer

9         and introduce into evidence as 3805; and then the

10         Surgeon General report for 2004, which is 3833 --

11          PT3833.

12              MR. WALKER: The objection is hearsay,

13         Your Honor, relevance, and 403.

14              THE COURT: Okay. Overruled. It will be

15         received.

16              (Exhibit Nos. PT 3805 and PT 3833 received.)

17              MR. WALKER: Your Honor, we had talked last

18         week --1 had asked because I need to figure out

19         what to tell my witnesses about when they need to

20         be here -- when the plaintiffs expect to rest, and

21          Your Honor said at that time that you would -- we

22         would have another discussion about it this week

23         once we got past Cummings. I just need to know

24         when I need to have somebody here. Our witnesses

25         are coming from a long way away --4118

1              MR. TRENTALANGE: To the honorable gent- --

2         gentleman to the testimony he gave yesterday -- as

3         they say at prime minister's questions, we've

4         discussed this yesterday. And we said Thursday

5         afternoon would be the soonest -- or Friday

6         morning would be the soonest. And, certainly,

7         today didn't change that.

8              MR. WALKER: I just want to be clear.

file:///YI/LTDL/Engle%20Progeny/DATTA/2013.01.23%20Trial%20Testimony%20Michael%20Cummings%20EVERS.txt[6/3/2013 2:46:25 PM]pgNbr=793
9              THE COURT: So you think you have witnesses

10         that would fill up Wednesday and Thursday?

11               MR. UITERWYK: Correct, Your Honor.

12              THE COURT: Okay. So you need to have

13         witnesses here by Friday.

14              MR. WALKER: By Friday?

15              THE COURT: Right.

16              MR. TRENTALANGE: We said the same thing

17         yesterday.

18              THE COURT: Okay. Well --

19              MR. BIGGER: By Thursday, Judge, I think he

20         means three Thursdays or the fortnight Thursday.

21               MR. TRENT ALANGE: There's nothing that

22         happened today that caused our estimate to be

23         shortened.

24              MR. SEIDEN: Your Honor, with two days to go,

25         might we get from plaintiff a disclosure of who 4119

1         their remaining witnesses are besides the ones

2         they said may be tomorrow?

3              THE COURT: They'll give it to you tomorrow.

4              MR. TRENTALANGE: I can meet with counsel

5         afterwards and tell them every one of our

6         remaining witnesses.

7              THE COURT: That's fine.

8              Mr. Seiden, would you mind --1 gave it back

9         to you, but would you find again the instruction I

10         gave in the beginning? I just want to reread it.

11               MR. SEIDEN: Yeah, let me fish it out.

12              THE COURT: Now that you put everything away.

13              MR. BIGGER: Judge, it's a little bit larger.

14         I think his was a mini.

15              THE COURT: I need to let the court reporter

16         and the clerk go. It's seven o'clock. They have

17         families to attend to. We'll be in recess until

18         nine o'clock tomorrow.

19              MR. PEDROSA: Thank you, Your Honor.

20              MR. WALKER: Thank you, Your Honor.

21               (A recess was taken at 7:03 p.m.) 22
