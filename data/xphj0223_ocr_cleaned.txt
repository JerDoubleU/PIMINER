	THE COURT: Good afternoon, everyone. I

	mentioned a long time ago, I actually have a

	had an opportunity during the lunch recess to

	11
	statement that Mr. Perrotto struggled to quit

12
	Let's go ahead and bring in the jury,
	12
	for many years. Actually, members of the jury,

13
	please.
	13
	the evidence will be that he made no effort to

14
	(The jury entered the courtroom at 2:03 p.m.)
	14
	quit smoking before 1980 or after 1982. And

15
	THE COURT: Good afternoon, everyone. I
	15
	even during the two-year period where he made

16
	hope everyone had a very nice lunch recess.
	16
	some efforts to quit, it will be undisputed

17
	And ladies and gentlemen, this afternoon
	17
	that he never went more than 24 hours without a

18
	defense counsel is going to present their
	18
	cigarette. And the Surgeon General will tell

19
	opening statements, and I will probably let you
	19
	you that that's not a serious quit attempt. In

20
	go a little bit early today. You guys have
	20
	order to be considered a serious attempt to

21
	been an excellent jury. A happy jury is a good
	21
	quit smoking, you have to go at least 24 hours

22
	way to start a trial.
	22
	without a cigarette.

23
	So I'm going to let you guys go a little
	23
	But after he was diagnosed with lung

24
	earlier today. But I'm going to ask tomorrow

	cancer in 1992, Nick Perrotto put his

	So July of 1992, Mr. Perrotto went to the

3
	little bit earlier on Fridays to let you guys

	doctor. He had been having pain in his

	out a little bit earlier, and we can be

5
	flexible with your schedule as well.

	some X-rays and discovered that Mr. Perrotto

	MR. COFER: Thank you, Your Honor.
	6
	had lung cancer.

7
	May it please the Court, counsel,
	7
	At first the news was particularly bad.

8
	Ms. Perrotto, ladies and gentlemen, good
	8
	They thought he had small cell lung cancer.

9
	afternoon.
	9
	Small cell lung cancer is a death sentence. By

10
	It's not going to happen to me. That's
	10
	the time he was diagnosed, it's assumed it has

11
	what Nick Perrotto would say when his wife
	11
	metastasized, so surgery is not even an option.

12
	Debra would talk to him about celebrities who
	12
	For someone with small cell lung cancer, the

13
	smoked and died of lung cancer.
	13
	average time between diagnosis and death is six   ij

14
	From the time Debra Perrotto met her
	14
	to nine months.

15
	husband in 1975, she was on him to quit
	15
	So Mr. Perrotto's doctors immediately

16
	smoking. Debra Perrotto always hated smoking.
	16
	started him on radiation and chemotherapy, and   ji

17
	She told her husband that his smoking was bad
	17
	they sent the little tissue they had to some

18
	for his health and breathing his smoke was bad
	18
	other outside expert pathologists to review it

19
	for her health.
	19
	to confirm the diagnosis.

20
	By the time she met her husband in 1975,
	20
	There wasn't a lot of tissue to look at

21
	Debra Perrotto already knew that smoking caused
	21
	because they only got what's called a needle

22
	lung cancer and emphysema and COPD.
	22
	biopsy. But when these other experts did look

23
	In the 1980s, Mrs. Perrotto and Mr.
	23
	at it, they said, "It's not small cell; it

24
	Perrotto would argue over smoking. She told
	24
	looks more like a neuroendocrine tumor."

	And that was great news, because if you

	Debra Perrotto has brought this lawsuit to

5
	outside the chest. It was in three hilar lymph

	recover money for her husband's decisions to

6
	nodes. They did scans throughout the body and
	6
	begin and continue smoking. She claims that he   i

7
	they confirmed there's no evidence of any
	7
	was addicted to the nicotine in the cigarettes

8
	cancer in his liver, in his bones, or in his
	8
	he smoked, and that his addiction was a legal

9
	brain.
	9
	cause ï¿½ we will talk about what that means a

10
	So in 1992, the doctors performed surgery;
	10
	little bit later ï¿½ his addiction was a legal

11
	they removed the part of the lung that had
	11
	cause of his '92 lung cancer, his '96 cancer in

12
	cancer, and Mr. Perrotto's lung cancer never
	12
	the brain, his twisted colon, his infection,

13
	came back.
	13
	and his death.

14
	Then four years later, in August of 1996,
	14
	So in thinking about my opening statement,

15
	Mr. Perrotto went to the hospital. He was
	15
	while I realize there are lots of things the

16
	having some dizziness and some headaches and
	16
	parties disagree about, there are a number of

17
	some disorientation. While he was in the
	17
	issues that we don't disagree about. So what I

18
	emergency room, he had a seizure.
	18
	thought I'd do is start with those so we can

19
	So they did a CAT scan, a CT scan, and
	19
	take those off the table and instead focus on

20
	they found a mass in the brain. Four days
	20
	the real issues in this case.

21
	later he underwent surgery to remove the mass.
	21
	First, there's no dispute that cigarette

22
	While he was in the hospital recovering
	22
	smoking causes disease including lung cancer.

23
	from the brain surgery, Mr. Perrotto developed
	23
	In fact, since 1985, these are some of the

24
	a twisted colon that required surgery. His
	24
	labels that are on the pack.

	So Mrs. Perrotto claims that the cancer

	There are many reasons why people smoke, and

15

	cause" a few times this morning, and you will

4
	other companies, they said some dumb things, no

5
	question about it. Some of them were
	5
	case. I want to take just a second to give you

6
	wrong-headed, and others, when you take them
	6
	a brief explanation of what that means.

7
	out of context, they look frankly absurd.
	7
	The law makes a distinction between

8
	Things where the companies denied smoking
	8
	something that is a cause in fact of an injury

9
	was a proven cause of cancer and other
	9
	and a legal cause. And let me give an example   jj

10
	diseases, whether smoking was addictive.
	10
	that has nothing to do with smoking. So

11
	It's true that the companies hung their
	11
	suppose today after court, I walk out of the

12
	hats on too many technical distinctions and
	12
	courthouse, I get hit by a truck. Well, what's

13
	they held on to those views for way too long.
	13
	the cause and fact of my injuries? I got hit

14
	So if we agree on all those things, is the
	14
	by a truck, right? That's pretty simple. But

15
	case over? Can we all go home? No, we can't,
	15
	what's the legal cause?

16
	and here's why. Plaintiff has to prove more
	16
	Before you can answer that question, you

17
	than that cigarettes cause disease, that
	17
	need to know more. Why did I get hit by the

18
	cigarettes can be addictive, and that the
	18
	truck? Did I ignore the warning light on the

19
	defendants did some dumb things. Because this
	19
	crosswalk?

20
	is Nick and Debra Perrotto's case. So what
	20
	MR. BASS: Objection, argument.

21 22 23 24 25
	plaintiff has to prove in this case is that something defendants actually did had a direct and substantial and direct impact on Nick Perrotto, not on the general public, but on Mr. Perrotto himself, to cause him to begin and
	21 22 23 24 25
	THE COURT: Sustained.
 MR. COFER: So here's the bottom line. In   \ order to be a class member, they have to show that an addiction to nicotine was a legal cause of his lung cancer and death. And so you need   jj

	cancer, why he died.

3
	So with that, let's talk about what it is
	3
	And the evidence will be and the jury

4
	the plaintiff has to prove.

	We talked a little bit about this in voir

	to have been a legal cause of an illness,

6

	6
	plaintiff has to show that Mr. Perrotto was

8
	whether Mr. Perrotto was a member of the Engle

	MR. BASS: Objection, improper standard.

10
	I think I told you yesterday, Engle was a

11
	case that was filed in Miami a number of years

12
	ago, and a jury in that case made certain
	12
	MR. COFER: Plaintiff has to show that Mr.    ;

13
	findings. And if you determine that
	13
	Perrotto was in fact addicted and that his

14
	Mr. Perrotto was a member of the Engle class,
	14
	addiction was so strong and so substantial that

15
	those findings apply to him, but then there are
	15
	but for his addiction, he would have quit

16
	other important issues you will have to decide.
	16
	smoking, he would not have gotten sick. And if jj

17
	We don't know exactly what the first
	17
	an addiction was not a legal cause of Mr.

18
	question is going to be on your verdict form,
	18
	Perrotto's injuries, the case is over.

19
	but Mr. Bass said it will be: Was Nicholas
	19
	Finally, members of the jury, even if you

20
	Perrotto's addiction to nicotine in cigarettes
	20
	decide that Mr. Perrotto was a member of the

21

1              begin and continue smoking and that's what made

2              him sick.

3                    So as you listen to the evidence in this

4               case, I respectfully suggest that you ask

5              yourself: What does any of this have to do

6              with Mr. Perrotto? Is there any evidence that

7              the defendants fooled him in any way, or did he

8              have the information that he needed to make an

9              informed decision whether to smoke or quit

10               smoking?

11                    Did Mr. Perrotto smoke because he was

12               addicted, or did he keep smoking because he was

13              just not ready to quit until his decision

14               caught up with him?

15                    We believe this case comes to three pretty

16               simple straightforward questions. When did Mr.

17               Perrotto know that smoking is dangerous? Who

18              was in control of Mr. Perrotto's decision to

19               smoke or quit smoking? Did smoking cause Mr. 2 0             Perrotto's colon to twist and cause his death?

21                  We believe, members of the jury, that the

2 2             evidence will be that Mr. Perrotto knew for

2 3             decades that cigarettes were dangerous and

2 4             caused lung cancer and emphysema and heart

2 5             disease.

Page   1540

1                    We believe the evidence will be that

2               Mr. Perrotto always had the ability to quit

3               smoking whenever he made up his mind that he

4               truly wanted to quit and ï¿½ this is

5               important ï¿½ that he was willing to make an

6               effort or efforts to quit.

7                    And finally, we believe the evidence will

8               be compelling that smoking had absolutely

9              nothing to do with causing Mr. Perrotto's colon

10               to twist or causing his death.

11                    So with that introduction, let's talk just

12               a little bit about Mr. Perrotto. And I

13               actually made a board with a timeline, but with

14               the courtroom the way it's set up, it will be

15              just too hard to do. So let's just kind of

16               walk through it. And you'll learn all of this

17               over the trial, but just kind of a brief

18               overview.

19                    So Nick Perrotto was born in Neptune, New 2 0             Jersey, on October 22, 1939. He had three

21             brothers and a sister. And he lived in New

2 2             Jersey for most of his life until he and Mrs.

2 3             Perrotto moved to Florida in 1977. 2 4                  As Mr. Bass told you, he was married three

2 5             times. He married his first wife, Barbara

Page   1541

1               Heppinstill, on February 18, 1961. They had

2               three children from that marriage. He married

3              his second wife, Mary Debra Brown, on

4               December 6, 1974. And then he and the

5              plaintiff were married in November of 1977, and

6              they were married until his death in 1996.

7                    So Debra and Nick Perrotto first met in

8               1975 when they were both working in her dad's

9              car dealership. Mr. Perrotto was a used car

10               salesman, he was 35 years old, he had been

11               married twice, he had three children. Debra

12               was 22 and single.

13                    Mr. Perrotto walked up to her, and the

14               first thing he said to her was, "I'm going to

15               marry you." They started dating. Six months

16               later they moved in together. They were

17               married in November of 1977. They had their

18               son, Michael, in 1982.

19                    Mr. Perrotto spent most of his life

2 0             working at various car dealerships here in

21             Florida and in New Jersey; before that, he

2 2             worked in a couple of restaurants and bars his

2 3             family owned. He worked as a bartender in his

2 4             older brother Santo's bar named Pillow Talk in

2 5             New Jersey. Witnesses described Mr. Perrotto

Page   1542

1              as a natural salesman, as gregarious, street

2              smart, savvy, a fun-loving man who loved to

3              socialize and enjoyed his life.

4                   You will hear by deposition from his big

5              brother, Santo. Santo was three years older

6              than Nick Perrotto. And Santo testified that

7              his little brother Nick started smoking between

8              the ages of 13 and 15, during the years ï¿½

9              somewhere 1952 to 1954.

10                   Santo also began smoking as a teenager in

11              the '50s, but he admitted that ever since he

12              started, and he started before his little

13              brother did, ever since Santo started, their

14              dad told them to quit smoking because

15              cigarettes weren't good for his health.

16                   Santo testified that he's the one who

17              influenced his little brother's brand choices.

18              According to Santo, Mr. Perrotto smoked the

19              brands that his big brother smoked. So they 2 0             both started off smoking Camel, as Mr. Bass

21              told you, and then at some point Santo switched

22              to Marlboro, so Nick switched to Marlboro. At

2 3             some point Santo switched to Newport because he

2 4             liked menthol, so Nick Perrotto switched to

2 5             Newport. At some point Santo switched to

	1
	health community told the public that filters

2
	But in 1986, Nick Perrotto stopped
	2
	and light cigarettes were safer. And here's

3
	following his big brother's example. In 1986,
	3
	the thinking, here's why: If tar is bad, since

4
	Santo Perrotto was hospitalized for heart
	4
	tar is bad, then less tar is less bad.

5
	problems caused by smoking. His doctors told
	5
	The Surgeon General never said light

6
	him, "You need to quit smoking." So Santo did.
	6
	cigarettes with filters were safe, the Surgeon

7
	It was a wake-up call. His smoking caught up
	7
	General said they're safer. And the Surgeon

8
	to him.
	8
	General never said it's okay to smoke if you

9
	So he told his little brother, "You need
	9
	smoke light cigarettes. The Surgeon General

10
	to quit smoking, too, so you don't end up with
	10
	always said, "If you're not going to quit, you

11
	heart problems like me."
	11
	should smoke a lower-delivery product."

12
	The evidence will be that Mr. Perrotto
	12
	It is undisputed that since the first

13
	ignored his brother's advice and kept on
	13
	warning went on the pack, I will show you that   ij

14
	smoking.
	14
	in a moment, in 1966, all cigarettes, lights,

15
	In his opening statement, Mr. Bass talked
	15
	full-flavored, ultra lights, filtered,

16
	a lot about filters and light cigarettes and
	16
	unfiltered, they all have the same Surgeon

17
	said that Mr. Perrotto switched to filters and
	17
	General's warnings on the pack. And the

18
	lights because defendants fooled him into
	18
	consistent message to the public was: If you

19
	thinking they were safe, and that is one of the
	19
	want to avoid the risks of smoking, don't

20
	things that Mrs. Perrotto testified about in
	20
	smoke. If you're not going to quit, smoke

21
	her deposition. But the evidence will be that
	21
	lower-tar cigarettes.

22
	Mrs. Perrotto's understanding as to why her
	22
	Mr. Bass also mentioned ultra light

23
	husband smoked filters is inconsistent and,
	23
	cigarettes in his opening statement, and he

24
	candidly, somewhat confusing.

11
	She then testified the real reason Mr.
	11
	Okay. In his opening statement, Mr. Bass

12
	Perrotto switched to filters was because they
	12
	argued that defendants hid the risk of smoking

13
	were advertised as being safer than unfiltered.
	13
	from Mr. Perrotto, and that he didn't have the

14
	So she was then asked, "Okay, so then what did
	14
	information he needed to make an informed

15
	Mr. Perrotto think was unsafe about unfiltered
	15
	decision whether to smoke or not smoke. So

16
	cigarettes?" And she said she had no idea what
	16
	let's look at what the evidence will be.

17
	he was thinking because she didn't know him
	17
	Starting in the early 1950s, before Mr.

18
	back then.
	18
	Perrotto ever smoked his first cigarette,

19
	So there will be an issue as to why Mr.
	19
	studies were being published that linked

20
	Perrotto smoked the brands he smoked and what
	20
	cigarette smoking with lung cancer. These

21
	Mr. Perrotto thought.
	21
	studies were widely reported, not just to

22
	Members of the jury, the evidence will be
	22
	scientific magazines but to popular magazines,

23
	that it wasn't the defendants that told the
	23
	Reader's Digest, News, Time, Good Health.

24
	public that filters were safer. The evidence
	24

	attacked. But the attacks took a new turn ten

8
	was a poll, a nationwide poll in June of 1954:
	8
	years ago and culminated into today's report by

9
	"Have you heard or read anything recently to

	11
	smoking is a major cause of lung cancer in men

12
	90 percent. This is 1954. This is right
	12
	and data on women smokers points the same way.   1

3              chances are.

4                    The Surgeon General's committee presented

5              its report at a news conference in Washington:

6              After long and exhaustive deliberations, the

7               committee has reached the overall judgment that

8               cigarette smoking is a health hazard of

9              sufficient importance to the United States to

10              warrant remedial action. This overall judgment

11              was supported by many converging lines of

12               evidence, as well as by data indicating that

13               cigarette smoking is related to higher death

14              rates in a number of disease categories.

15                    More specifically, the many states on page

16               61 of the report, and I quote: In view of the

17               continuing and mounting evidence from many

18               sources, it is the judgment of the committee

19              that cigarette smoking contributes

2 0             substantially to mortality from certain

21             specific diseases and to the overall death

2 2             rate.

1               lives. It is like being told that an old

2               friend has all along been betraying you. In a

3              case like that, you give the old friend every

4              possible chance before you finally decide to

5              believe what you have been told, and maybe even

6              then you give him a chance to reform. In this

7              kind of a country it comes down to you whether

8              you like it or not. No one is going to forbid

9              an adult to smoke and it is now quite clear

10               that no one is going to tell him it's good for

11               him either. The decision is his. The decision

12               and the health that may depend on it. This is

13              Harry Reasoner, good night.

14                    (End of video.)

15                    MR. COFER: Nick Perrotto was 24 years old

16              at the time that report came out and that

17              publicity aired.

18                    You heard Mr. Bass say in opening

19               statement that the defendants denied that

2 0             smoking was addictive. Well, let's see what

21             the Surgeon General had to say in 1964 whether

2 2             smoking was addictive.

2 3                  Correctly designating ï¿½ first, tobacco

2 4             habit characterized as habituation.

1               habituation.

2                    In 1964, the Surgeon General said smoking

3               is a habit and not an addiction. And the

4              reason why is, in 1964, the definition of an

5               addiction required intoxication and cigarette

6               smoking isn't intoxicating.

7                    Now, I want you to think back to one of

8               the last clips that you saw in opening

9               statement, the Waxman hearings. You remember

10               Congressman Wyden asked the CEOs from the

11               tobacco companies: "You agree that smoking is

12               addictive or nonaddictive." And Mr. Johnson

13               from R.J. Reynolds said, "Congressman, I don't

14               agree, it doesn't meet the classic definition,

15               it's not intoxicating" and he cut him off. Did

16              you notice that?

17                    So here's the bottom line. It wasn't

18               until 1988 that the Surgeon General adopted a

19              new definition and said that addiction no

2 0             longer requires intoxication. So it changed

21             the definition in '88.

2 2                  Between 1964 and 1988, when the companies

2 3             referred to smoking as a habit and not an

2 4             addiction, they were agreeing with the Surgeon

2 5             General. But here's the most important point.

Page   1554

1               Look what the Surgeon General said: "Thus

2               correctly designating the chronic use of

3              tobacco as habituation rather than addiction

4               carries with it no implication, the habit may

5              be broken easily."

6                    You will see evidence in this case,

7               literally going back hundreds of years,

8               scientists and laypeople used the words

9               "addiction" and "habit" interchangeably to

10               describe it can be very hard to quit smoking.

11               It's not the label that's important, it's the

12               behavior. And the evidence will be, literally,

13               going back hundreds of years, and you will see

14               it in this courtroom, people have known for a

15              very, very long time that if you smoke it can

16              be very hard to quit.

17                    So, what happened after the Surgeon

18               General's report? Well, made a big splash. Of

19               course Congress got involved. Right? And they 2 0             held hearings and they passed something called 21             the Federal Cigarette Labeling Act, and it

2 2             required the companies to put warning labels on

2 3             cigarette packs.

2 4                  Here's the first label. It went on in

2 5             January of 1966.

	hazardous to your health." Now, that looks
	2
	One of the very first things I told you is

3
	pretty tame, doesn't it?
	3
	that the defendants admit that cigarette

4
	What you will hear is the context of the
	4
	smoking can be addictive. Some smokers do, in   ji

5

	5
	fact, become addicted. But it is also

6
	a caution or warning label was required to be
	6
	undisputed that even addicted smokers can and

7
	put on a consumer product. Now you see them on
	7
	do quit. Plaintiffs own experts will tell you

8
	everything, but this truly was a unique
	8
	that. They will tell you that each and every

9
	circumstance in 1966.
	9
	day thousands of people in this country quit

10
	Congress told the companies exactly the
	10
	smoking. I told you that by the time of the

11
	wording of the label they mandated in the law,
	11
	1990 report more than half or half the people

12
	they told them where on the pack it will be,
	12
	that ever smoked already quit. The vast

13
	what the size would be, even the font that
	13
	majority of those quit without any kind of

14
	would be used. So from that time on, every
	14
	smoking aids, patches, gum, whatever. They

15
	cigarette sold in this country, from 1966, had
	15
	basically quit cold turkey.

16
	a congressionally mandated label on it.
	16
	And the evidence will be that the single

17
	In 1970, the warning changed and Congress
	17
	most important factor in whether someone is

18
	made it stronger. Beginning in 1970, the
	18
	able to successfully quit smoking is motivation

19
	warning says: "Warning, the Surgeon General
	19
	and persistence.

20
	has determined that cigarette smoking is
	20
	Simply put, unless and until you decide

21
	dangerous to your health."
	21
	that you want to quit, and you're willing to

22
	For the next 15 years, every cigarette
	22
	make an effort or efforts to quit, chances are

23
	that Mr. Perrotto smoked came from a pack that
	23
	you're not going to quit.

24
	had this warning on it. And Mrs. Perrotto
	24
	So did Nick Perrotto really want to quit?

25
	remembers this warning and she says that her
	25
	Did he really make an effort to quit? As I


	Page   1556
	
	Page   1558     \

1
	husband read this warning and they talked about
	1
	told you, the evidence is undisputed. No quits

2
	it, and she said they talked about the warnings
	2
	before 1980, no quit attempts after 1982.

3
	all the time.
	3
	During that two-year period, never went more

4
	Then in 1985, the warnings changed, the
	4
	than a single day without a cigarette. That's

5
	ones that I showed you earlier: "Quitting
	5
	it-

6
	smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to
	6
	Then, when he believed that his smoking

7
	your health. Smoking causes lung cancer, heart

	came to roost, he put his cigarettes down and

	never smoked again. You'll have to decide

9

	9
	whether Mr. Perrotto really wanted to quit

10
	So we know for a fact that the public is
	10
	smoking.

11
	being warned that smoking causes cancer and
	11
	So why is it important? Why is it

12
	heart disease and quitting smoking reduced your
	12
	important that he waited so long to quit?

13
	risk.
	13
	Because as you-all know, every time you go to

14
	As I already mentioned, we know that Mr.
	14
	the doctor, the doctor asks if you smoke; and

15
	Perrotto got a very personal warning the very
	15
	if you smoke, the doctor tells you to quit.

16
	next year when his brother, Santo, was
	16
	And the reason the doctor tells you to quit is

17
	hospitalized with a heart condition caused by
	17
	because when a smoker quits smoking, his or her

	And it's undisputed that Mr. Perrotto did

10
	have made a difference, had he quit smoking in

	the '60s or the '70s or even the '80s, his risk
	11
	Had it spread outside the chest, they never

12
	would have dropped dramatically, but Mr.
	12
	would have done the surgery.

13
	Perrotto didn't.
	13
	So the evidence will be that in '92, the

	But here's the most important point of my

	scans of the brain showed no evidence of

	cancer.

16

	16
	In 1996, when they discovered a single

17
	lung cancer had nothing to do with his death.
	17
	solitary mass in the brain, they did scans of

	19
	in his chest. And what those scans show is

20
	Plaintiff is claiming that Mr. Perrotto's lung
	20
	that his chest was clear in '96.

21
	cancer in 1992 caused him to die of an
	21
	So in '92 he has cancer in his chest, not

22
	infection in 1996. Everyone agrees that Mr.
	22
	in the brain. In '96, he has cancer in the

23
	Perrotto had lung cancer in 1992, and everyone
	23

24
	agrees that he died from septic shock in 1996.

	that brain surgery causes sepsis. What caused

	Perrotto was on because of his lung cancer

	10
	We believe the evidence will be that at

11
	First, Mr. Perrotto never had a history of
	11
	all times Mr. Perrotto had the tools to quit

12
	constipation. Dr. Neimark, his treating
	12
	any time he was sufficiently motivated,

	gastroenterologist, will testify that he went
	13
	sufficiently motivated to quit, and willing to

14
	through all of Mr. Perrotto's medical records
	14
	make the efforts to quit. We believe the

15
	meticulously, carefully reviewed them, and
	15
	plaintiff will not be able to meet her burden

16
	found no evidence that Mr. Perrotto ever

	Perrotto.

11
	When you first showed up for jury duty
	11
	One of plaintiff s experts may come in and

12
	last Friday, Judge Sasser read to you a quote
	12
	admit to you that he doesn't know anything

13
	from one of our founding fathers, John Adams.
	13
	about Nicholas Perrotto, he will just tell you

	It referred to the jury as the heart and lungs
	14
	what those findings were based on, and you will   i;

	15
	have to decide later whether or not they apply.

16
	Actually, four years before that quote,
	16
	You will see more documents marked

	when John Adams was a simple lawyer in Boston,

6
	I'm going to focus on the facts and the

	Tobacco Company, a North Carolina corporation.
	12
	and gentlemen, you will learn that the research

13
	I'm proud to be here today representing the
	13
	was done at the suggestion of prominent cancer

14
	4,000 men and women who work for Reynolds
	14
	researchers, like the National Cancer

15
	today. Reynolds is a company whose employees
	15
	Institute, that Reynolds published a book about

16
	compete with Philip Morris, who compete with
	16
	it, and that that research would end up at

17
	Lorillard and Liggett. Different companies,

	another company which is trying to use that

	As you heard from Mr. Cofer, there are

3
	whether any of those findings apply to

	statements by tobacco company representatives,

4
	Mr. Perrotto and the decisions and choices that

	today. That's right. But this case is about

7
	Mr. Perrotto. And you will hear a lot of
	7
	Mr. Perrotto, what mattered to him, and why he

8
	evidence about Mr. Perrotto.
	8
	made the decisions that he made throughout his

9
	In particular, the evidence about
	9
	life.

10
	Mr. Perrotto will show you three things.
	10
	And that evidence is that Mr. Perrotto was

11
	First, Mr. Perrotto knew the dangers. He was
	11
	in charge of his own decisions. He made his

12
	warned.
	12
	own decisions and he wasn't relying on anything   ij

13
	Second, despite the warnings, Mr. Perrotto
	13
	that anyone at any tobacco company said.

14
	chose to smoke. He didn't want to quit, he
	14
	Take Lorillard. There will be no evidence

15
	wasn't motivated to quit, and you will hear
	15
	that there was anything that anyone at

16
	that for many years he never tried to quit.
	16
	Lorillard ever said or did or didn't do that

17
	And, third, when Mr. Perrotto ultimately
	17
	had any impact on Mr. Perrotto or any of his

18
	was motivated to quit, he was able to quit. He
	18

19
	put his cigarettes down in 1992, he quit cold

	So the evidence will show you that this is

	and 1977, the evidence you will hear is that

22
	not a case about a smoker who was always trying
	22

	if there was any help that he could get to make

4
	smoking.
	4
	some effort to quit.

5
	Now, for that matter, as Mr. Cofer told
	5
	And he never went to any of those smoking

6
	you, every pack of cigarettes from 1966 on,
	6
	cessation clinics where they help folks who are   ji

7
	every brand, all had the Surgeon General's
	7
	looking to make some effort to try to quit.

8
	caution or the warning. But as to Lorillard,
	8
	Now, when Mr. Perrotto was motivated to

9
	in those years, 1975, 1977, there will be no
	9
	quit, he was able to quit. You heard that from

10
	dispute that every time Mr. Perrotto reached
	10
	Mr. Bass. In 1992, Mr. Perrotto put the

11
	for a pack of cigarettes, that pack had the
	11
	cigarettes down, he quit, he quit cold turkey,

12
	warning on the side.
	12
	and he never smoked again.

13
	Even after all the warnings, some people
	13
	Now, Mrs. Perrotto will say he only quit

14
	choose to smoke, and they have the right to
	14
	in 1992 because he was too ill to smoke. But

15
	make their choice of how they live their life.
	15
	you will hear from Mr. Perrotto's treating

16
	The evidence will show that Mr. Perrotto's
	16
	doctor, Dr. Neal Rothschild, that there was

17
	choice was that he wanted to smoke and he
	17
	nothing about Mr. Perrotto's medical condition

18
	didn't want to quit. In fact, despite all the
	18
	that prevented him from smoking if that's what

19
	warnings over all the years, until 1981, that's
	19
	he wanted to do.

20
	more than 25 years, the evidence will be that
	20
	In fact, you will hear that after

21
	Mr. Perrotto never tried to quit, not one time.
	21
	Mr. Perrotto quit smoking in 1992, for the next   ji

22
	Now, what happened in 1981? Well, in
	22
	nearly four years, he never went back to

23
	1981, 1982, Ms. Perrotto was expecting their
	23
	smoking. During those years he was able to go   ji

24
	son, Michael, and she asked Mr. Perrotto to
	24
	out to dinner with his family, he was able to

25
	quit smoking, and he told her that he would try
	25
	go up north, visit his family in New Jersey, go


	Page   1588
	
	Page   15 90     ij

1
	because she asked him. But she does not say
	1
	to a ball game, go fishing, but he never went

2
	that he ever stopped, even a single time, for
	2
	back to smoking because he was motivated to

3
	as long as 24 hours. Mr. Perrotto was not
	3
	quit. If he had been motivated to quit

4
	motivated to quit because he wanted to smoke.
	4
	earlier, he would have quit earlier.

5
	You will hear about his brother-in-law.
	5
	So the evidence will show that

6
	His brother-in-law was a smoker, many years.
	6
	Mr. Perrotto was able to smoke when he wanted

7
	He wanted to quit. Went to a hypnotist. It
	7
	to smoke and he was able to quit when he wanted

8
	worked. He came back, he told Mr. Perrotto,
	8
	to quit. He was an independent man who lived

9
	told him about the hypnotist. He told him, "If
	9
	his life the way he wanted to live his life.

10
	I can do it, anybody can do it."
	10
	When he smoked Lorillard cigarettes in

11
	So the brother-in-law and Mrs. Perrotto
	11
	those years between 1975 and 1977, he was 36,

12
	wanted Mr. Perrotto to go to the hypnotist.
	12
	37 years of age. He had the right to make his

13
	Mr. Perrotto never told his brother-in-law that
	13
	decisions about how he lived his life.

14
	he actually went to the hypnotist. He told his
	14
	So ladies and gentlemen, Ms. Schaefer and

15
	wife that he had gone, but if he did, she saw
	15
	I will not take up much of your time in this

16
	him with his cigarettes in his top pocket. And
	16
	trial. We do ask that you listen to the

17
	what he said to her was: "Hypnotism is not for
	17
	evidence, and that includes the evidence that

18
	me."
	18
	Mr. Perrotto was aware of the risks, that he

19
	Now, she was a little bit upset with him
	19
	was warned, the evidence that despite the

20
	at the time for treating the whole thing like a
	20
	warnings for many years, Mr. Perrotto was not

21
	joke, but the bottom line is that Mr. Perrotto
	21
	motivated to quit. For many years he never

22
	was simply not motivated to quit.
	22
	tried to quit, and the evidence that when

23
	And you will hear that from that time,
	23
	Mr. Perrotto ultimately was motivated to quit,

24
	from 1982 until 1992, another ten years, there
	24
	he was able to quit.

25
	is not a single concrete action that
	25
	Thank you.

	THE COURT: Thank you very much,
	1
	Mr. Perrotto's decision to smoke cigarettes,

2
	Mr. Maguire.
	2
	even though they were cigarettes made by other

3
	Ms. Kaschel.
	3
	companies, and that resulted in injuries that

4
	MS. KASCHEL: Thank you, Your Honor.
	4
	now Liggett is liable for.

5
	Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My
	5
	So what I want to discuss is a certain

6
	name is Nancy Kaschel, and I represent Liggett
	6
	thing ï¿½ certain things that are specific to

7
	Group. Along with me representing Liggett is
	7
	Liggett and talk a little bit about my client.

8
	Giselle Manseur, as well as my colleague Kelly
	8
	Because you will learn a lot about different

9
	Luther, who you might remember from jury
	9
	companies in this case, different

10
	selection, who will be here next week as well.
	10
	organizations. There will be a lot of evidence

11
	I am happy to report that I am the last to
	11
	that doesn't relate to Liggett at all. And

12
	go, and I will be relatively brief as well.
	12
	what I ask for you to do is to try as much as

13
	Let me start, though, with three important
	13
	you can to separate out where these documents

14
	points that I would like to convey to you that
	14
	are coming from.

15
	are specific to my client. And those are,
	15
	Mr. Bass in his opening already pointed

16
	number one, there will be no evidence in this
	16
	to, for example, a document by another

17
	case that Liggett cigarettes were the cause of
	17
	defendant, and then followed up by saying "this

18
	whatever illness Mr. Perrotto had or ultimately
	18
	shows that the defendants knew this." Whatever  ji

19
	died from.
	19
	it shows, it did not come from my company. So

20
	There will also be no evidence in this
	20
	those are the sorts of things that the

21
	case that Mr. Perrotto was ever addicted to
	21
	generalizations that I am asking you to

22
	Liggett cigarettes. And you will learn at the
	22
	consider and be careful of when considering the

23
	end of this case that nothing Liggett said or
	23
	claims that this plaintiff has against my

24
	didn't say had any impact on Mr. Perrotto's
	24
	client.

25
	decision to smoke for 40 years.
	25
	Let me tell you a little bit about


	Page   1592
	
	Page   15 94     \

1
	Now, you certainly don't need me to go
	1
	Liggett. Liggett is a small tobacco company

2
	over the same ground already well covered by
	2
	these days. Today is has about 2 percent of

3
	other counsel, but again, I just want to go
	3
	the market in this country. It sells mostly

4
	over some specific things that are unique to my
	4
	discounted nonbrand cigarettes, cigarettes that

5
	client.
	5
	most people have never heard of, but back in

6
	The most important point that I think I
	6
	the day, some 50 or 60 years ago, it did sell

7
	need to make is that Mr. Perrotto never smoked
	7
	some premium brand cigarettes, specifically

8
	a Liggett brand cigarette. Liggett did not ï¿½
	8
	L & M and Chesterfield.

9
	Liggett was not the source of any cigarette
	9
	Liggett was the first company to ever make

10
	that he smoked at any time during his lifetime,
	10
	public admissions about smoking, and it did so

11
	and plaintiffs do not contend that he was.
	11
	in cooperation with government officials, and

12
	So what that means is that there's no
	12
	it publicly admitted that smoking was related

13
	claim in this case that Liggett cigarettes
	13
	to certain diseases and was addictive.

14
	caused Mr. Perrotto's illness or death.
	14
	Evidence of Liggett's conduct will include

15
	So we're situated a little bit differently
	15
	the fact that Liggett ï¿½ I'm sorry, that it was

16
	than the other three defendants where there is
	16
	the first company, also, to put on the side of

17
	a claim that Mr. Perrotto smoked the other
	17
	its packaging the list of ingredients in its

18
	three defendants' cigarettes.
	18
	cigarettes and is still the only company in

19
	Plaintiff has claimed an allegation of
	19
	this country to do so today.

20
	conspiracy against Liggett, and that conspiracy
	20
	And you will learn that as far back as the

21
	is that Liggett hid from the public certain
	21
	'50s and '60s, Liggett was doing its own thing.

22
	information about the public ï¿½ I'm sorry, the
	22
	It took an aggressive independent path within

23
	risk of smoking. And they also claim that
	23
	the industry. In fact, much of the facts that

24
	Liggett, specifically Liggett's participation
	24
	plaintiffs used to try to include Liggett in

25
	in this agreement somehow impacted
	25
	this theory of a conspiracy ï¿½

4
	MS. KASCHEL: The evidence will show that
	4
	General's report for that research.

5
	Liggett was not part of many of the key events
	5
	But Mr. Bass told you that all the

6
	that plaintiffs claim were evidence of a
	6
	companies acted in unison. But I submit to you   \

7
	conspiracy.
	7
	that after reviewing the evidence you will find

8
	For instance, as already mentioned by
	8
	that Liggett was not a part of the conspiracy.

9
	Mr. Bass in his opening, the 1953 Plaza Hotel
	9
	Liggett contends that there was no conspiracy,

10
	meeting, The Frank Statement, those were not
	10
	and if there's any ï¿½ if there's a lack of

11
	events that Liggett was involved in.
	11
	evidence to support a conspiracy, you go no

12
	Liggett did not retain the consulting firm
	12
	further to look at Liggett, because it was

13
	of Hill and Knowlton, and was also not a part
	13
	doing its own thing, it was not involved with

14
	of other organizations, such as the TIRC at the
	14
	many of the other companies during this time.

15
	beginning.
	15
	So what I really want to ask you to do,

16
	What plaintiffs hang their hat on ï¿½
	16
	though, is just to please look at the evidence

17
	MR. BASS: Objection, argument.
	17
	independently and fairly, and to remember that,

18
	THE COURT: Sustained.
	18
	as has already been reminded to you, that

19
	MS. KASCHEL: The evidence will show that
	19
	plaintiffs have a separate burden to prove as

20
	plaintiffs ï¿½ the evidence will show that
	20
	to each defendant in this case.

21
	Liggett was, in fact, a member of The Tobacco
	21
	And I submit to you that at the end of

22
	Institute, and plaintiffs hang their hat on the
	22
	plaintiffs case, you will not find that

23
	fact that ï¿½

	anything Liggett said or did not say, including

24
	MR. BASS: Objection, argument.

	Liggett became a member of The Tobacco

	fact of TI membership, I submit to you, you

14
	conspiracy on Liggett's behalf.

	(The jury exited the courtroom at 3:32 p.m.)

	In fact, the evidence will show that

	MR. GDANSKI: I agree.

8
	I can find out when his lectures would be
	8
	MR. GDANSKI: I will let Your Honor know,

9
	and work around his schedule, but I needed to
	9
	but I know one thing for sure, no motions in

10
	read that into the record. He handed that note
	10
	Tullo had to do with Dr. Hurt.

11
	to the Court today. Okay.
	11
	MR. CHESIN: Oh, absolutely - they don't

12
	MR. CHESIN: I imagine we may also want to
	12
	deal with Dr. Hurt, but they had to deal with

13
	ask a bit about exactly what kind of -
	13
	some of the documents.

14
	THE COURT: I'm happy to -
	14
	THE COURT: That's fine. So, Mr. Gdanski,

15
	MR. CHESIN: What he's going to talk
	15
	please let me know any comments to the proposed   \

16
	about -
	16
	order by tomorrow, though.

17
	THE COURT: I am happy to have him stay,
	17
	MR. GDANSKI: Sure.

18
	that's fine. So, he's alternate number two
	18
	THE COURT: Okay.

19
	anyway ï¿½
	19
	MR. CHESIN: So the other thing that I

20
	MR. GDANSKI: I know that.
	20
	will say, again, to speed things along, we have

21
	THE COURT: -so...
	21
	filed ï¿½ we filed written objections to every

22
	MR. GDANSKI: I don't know that we should
	22
	one of the documents that were provided to us

23
	inquire as to the nature of any of his
	23
	by plaintiff on the 48-hour ï¿½ first it was a

24
	presentation. The details, which he was just

	48-hour list for Dr. Proctor and then when

25
	saying, but his availability to do X, Y and Z.
	25
	things changed it became a 48-hour list for Dr.

	To the extent there are documents, or

	And the alternative request ï¿½ and as to

6
	going to try to reargue those ï¿½
	6
	this ï¿½ we do think this is serious. Dr. Hurt

7
	THE COURT: Okay.
	7
	is passionate about what he believes, he's been

8
	MR. CHESIN: - but we would, I believe,
	8
	doing this for a very long time, he does tend

9
	submit our objections in writing, and we would
	9
	to give answers to questions that haven't been

10
	ask Your Honor, for the record, to consider
	10
	asked. He does tend to volunteer information

11
	those objections and overrule them; and I would
	11
	that's ï¿½

12
	ask for a little bit of guidance as to the best
	12
	THE COURT: Mr. Gdanski knows what I do

13
	way for the Court to facilitate that to make
	13
	with experts who do that, so hopefully he won't

14
	sure that we have a record that you consider in
	14
	be doing that, so...

15
	overruling the objections.
	15
	As a gentle reminder, I would ask Mr.

16
	THE COURT: You probably want to go ahead
	16
	Gdanski to suggest to Dr. Hurt that he not do

17
	and have ï¿½ to have a clean record, I would go
	17
	that. So...

18
	ahead and allow you to make an oral ï¿½ you can
	18
	MR. CHESIN: And that's - that's all we

19
	make your oral rulings, and I can go ahead and
	19
	ask.

20
	stay after the jury goes one evening and we can
	20
	THE COURT: Okay. Okay.

21
	just go ahead and have that, if necessary.
	21
	MR. CHESEN: And then the other component

22
	MR. CHESIN: Yeah.
	22
	of that motion was the Daubert motion. We

23
	MR. GDANSKI: Judge, why don't they just
	23
	pointed out that Dr. Hurt has no expertise in

24
	file the documents that came in, in Tullo and
	24
	advertising, no expertise in marketing, no

25
	Cohen, list their objections, and then one day
	25
	expertise in cigarette design, and we ask that

	Your Honor can say, I read that document and I

	2
	in those areas. I don't know if he plans to do

3
	THE COURT: If that's acceptable to

	so and, again, I can largely stand on papers

4
	plaintiffs counsel and there's no waiver

	for that.

5
	issues, then sobeit.
	5
	THE COURT: Response for the record?

6
	MR. CHESIN: That's what we've done. So
	6
	MR. GDANSKI: I think he has expertise in

7
	as long as ï¿½ there will be certain ones that
	7
	all of those categories, certainly sufficient

8
	we will argue, even ones that came in in Cohen
	8
	to give testimony, but it's not my intention to

9
	if we think there's a distinction, but that's
	9
	ask him about advertising, other than to the

10
	what we're hoping to do is give it to you on
	10
	extent he's aware of how it impacted Nick

11
	Monday.
	11
	Perrotto, because he did review case-specific

12
	THE COURT: That's perfectly fine.
	12
	materials in this case, but the advertising and

13
	MR. CHESTN: Okay. So with that out of
	13
	history, evolution, importance, rise in

14
	the way, there's one motion that we filed as to
	14
	consumption relative to advertising, that's all

15
	which I can mostly stand on my papers, and then
	15
	going to be, hopefully, done with Dr. Proctor.

16
	there's the handful of documents that each of
	16
	So I don't have to worry about that.

17
	us wants to discuss.
	17
	THE COURT: So you have no intention to do

18
	THE COURT: Okay.
	18
	so. Okay.

19
	MR. CHESEN: The motion that we filed, it
	19
	MR. GDANSKI: Cigarette design, however,

20
	was the Daubert motions, directed to Dr. Hurt.
	20
	is a different issue, that is something that we

21
	There were two components of it. The first one
	21
	do intend on doing with Dr. Hurt.

22
	was that we ï¿½ well, the first we ask Your
	22
	I just think he's obviously abundantly

23
	Honor to prohibit him from testifying all
	23
	qualified to discuss how cigarettes are

24
	together because he has a history of going off
	24
	designed to sustain addiction, which is what he

25
	and giving answers that are narrative. I won't
	25
	spent his entire life dealing with. He's

1               written papers on it. He is the first ï¿½ I

2               mean, I don't know if Your Honor's looked

3               through our response. We filed it, we never ï¿½

4                    THE COURT: I did. I did. Go ahead,

5               argue ï¿½ make your statements for the record.

6                    MR. GDANSKI: He's reviewed millions of

7               pages of the documents. He was the first

8               person to actually review them under seal when

9               it came out in the Minnesota litigation. He

10               was a witness in that case and spent two years,

11               I think, just reviewing internal company

12               documents. On all issues, you know,

13               conspiracy, fraud, design, filters, but just

14               specific to cigarette design and manipulation,

15               and how cigarettes are designed to sustain

16               addiction, he's abundantly qualified to do

17               that.

18                    THE COURT: Rebuttal?

19                    MR. CHESIN: We stand on our papers.

2 0                  THE COURT: Okay. I am going to deny

21              defendant's Daubert motion with respect to Dr.

2 2             Hurt on the cigarette design.

2 3                  Plaintiff has stipulated, for the record,

2 4             he will not solicit any testimony or

2 5             advertisement from Dr. Hurt.

Page   1608

1                    MR. GDANSK!: I'll probably have some -

2              In other words, it's not going to come today,

3              but he's going to talk about advertising in the

4               sense that relates to the Perrotto case.

5                    THE COURT: Okay. And that's - that's

6              fine.

7                    MR. GDANSK!: It's a little different.

8                    MR. CHESIN: So with the motions out of

9              the way, we have ï¿½ PM has a handful of

10               documents to discuss as to the other

11               defendants.

12                    THE COURT: Sure.

13                    MR. CHESIN: So the first that I want to

14               mention is Exhibit Number 2221, which is one of

15              the Merrell Dow documents.

16                    Your Honor will recall that this came up

17               in the prior two cases.

18                    THE COURT: Correct.

19                    MR. CHESIN: This is a document that was 2 0             excluded in both Tullo and in Cohen. It deals

21             with communications between Philip Morris and

2 2             Merrell Dow over the marketing of Nicorette

2 3             gum. We don't think this has anything to do

2 4             with Perrotto. It was excluded in the prior

2 5             cases and for the reasons that we gave in the

Electronically signed by Gina Rodriguez (201-182-126-9514)

Page   1609

1              prior cases, and Your Honor gave, we ask that

2               they be excluded again.

3                    THE COURT: Response on the Dow issue?

4                    MR. GDANSKI: I think that they should not

5              be excluded. They're documents that go

6              directly to two different things: One is the

7               availability and the ability of smokers to stop

8               smoking in the '80s by use of Nicorette gum,

9              which was impacted by Philip Morris' boycott.

10               And it goes to number two, which was Philip

11               Morris historically did not want to take steps

12               to promote smoking cessation.

13                    The brief background of the issue is that

14               Philip Morris sold ï¿½ or Philip Morris received

15               supplies from Merrell Dow, Merrell Dow is

16               coming out with Nicorette gum, Philip Morris

17               said, if you come out with a product that's

18               going to impact the sales of our product,

19              nicotine in the cigarettes, we're going to stop 2 0             using you as a supplier for cigarette ï¿½ I

21             think it was filters on cigarettes. 2 2                  And so if Philip Morris is going to say,

2 3             you know, we never had any impact or effect,

2 4             which was in the entire opening, by the way,

2 5             nothing we did ever impacted his smoking

Page   1610

1               behaviors, well, that's just not true. The

2               fact is that they impacted millions of people's

3               smoking behaviors by, A, creating the false

4               data controversy, but specific to this issue,

5               by creating a situation such that not only did

6               they not promote, but they caused delay and

7               impacted utility and availability of Nicorette

8               gum.

9                    THE COURT: I am going to make the same

10               determination I did in both the Cohen case and

11               the Tullo case and, furthermore, in this case

12               it doesn't seem like there's any evidence that

13               Mr. Perrotto even attempted to use any smoking

14               cessation products, right?

15                    MR. GDANSKI: I disagree with that in its

16               entirety.

17                    THE COURT: At least that's what I've

18               heard from the opening. I don't know.

19                    MR. GDANSKI: It's not true-2 0                  THE COURT: Okay.

21                  MR. GDANSKI: --but even if that were

2 2             true, it's just the opposite. If that was the

2 3             case ï¿½ the case that he did not use Nicorette

2 4             gum, then that makes it all the more relevant

2 5             because the fact that they suppressed it

	THE COURT: Any additional PM objections?

2
	In other words, if he used Nicorette gum,
	2
	MR. CHESIN: Yes. Document Exhibit Number  \

3
	you can say, "What's the difference if we
	3
	4677, it is a video composite of news coverage

	caused a boycott, he used it anyway?"

6
	him. The fact that they caused a boycott and
	6
	If Your Honor remembers, this is a video

7

	of Dan Rather interviewing Dr. Koop, and I

	sent a series of slides last night, which
	12
	and we will go until about 4:20 so I'm

13
	contained the underlying documents we wanted to
	13
	consistent with my promise that I'd let them

14
	use with Dr. Hurt. There are a series of
	14
	out early.

15
	demonstratives, which Danny just printed out
	15
	MR. GDANSKI: It's something.

16
	and gave to me. But those documents and slides
	16
	THE COURT: Okay. I don't want to get on

17
	last night ï¿½
	17
	the bad side from the beginning, so...

18
	THE COURT: That's it.

	22

23
	MR. CHESIN: That's great. We just wanted

	Our request is not that you look at our

24
	to make sure that that's the ï¿½ that's the
	24
	objections and overrule them, but our request

	25
	is that you look at them and rule upon them.

	BY MR. GDANSKE
	2
	A   Well, I am credited with it, but it's

3
	Q    Good afternoon, Dr. Hurt.
	3
	actually a lot of people together that got together

4
	A    Good afternoon.
	4
	to provide treatment for smokers in 1988, which was

5
	MR. GDANSKE Good afternoon, ladies and
	5
	the time when there were no treatments really

6
	gentlemen. My name is John Gdanski and I also
	6
	available to speak of, so we got a group together

7
	represent Debbie Perrotto with Mr. Bass.
	7
	and developed the program to focus on treating

8
	Good afternoon. If it please the Court.
	8
	people with tobacco dependence.

9
	THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Gdanski.
	9
	Q    What is the Mayo Clinic? People have

10
	BY MR. GDANSKI:
	10
	heard of that before, but what is the Mayo Clinic?

11
	Q    Dr. Hurt, can you just tell the ladies and
	11
	A   It's called a group practice, but it's

12
	gentlemen of the jury who you are and where you came
	12
	really more than that. It's the integration of

13
	from?
	13
	three things. And, in fact, the logo we have has

14
	A   My name is Richard Hurt and I'm a general
	14
	three interlocking shields, and one represents

15
	internist. I recently retired from working at the
	15
	patient care, which is the big one in the middle,

16
	Mayo Clinic on July the 3rd.
	16
	and the other two shields represent education and

17
	Q    And that's the Mayo Clinic where?
	17
	research.

18
	A   In Rochester, Minnesota.
	18
	So really the magic of that clinic is the

19
	Q    Did you come out here to testimony in this
	19
	integration of practice, education and research.

20
	case?
	20
	And the shield in the middle focuses on patients,

21
	A   I did.
	21
	and so the needs of the patient comes first. And so

22
	Q    When did you get here?
	22
	we focus on that as the major thing we do.

23
	A    Last night.
	23
	So the Mayo Clinic has three locations;

24
	Q    And you've been sitting around waiting to
	24
	one is in Rochester, Minnesota, where it was

25
	get on the stand today?
	25
	founded, and then one in Jacksonville, Florida, and

1         other one is in Scottsdale, Arizona.

2              Q    And for how long were you at the Mayo

3         Clinic in Rochester?

4              A    Well, I went there in 1973 as a resident

5         in internal medicine, and then I went on staff in

6         76, and then retired in July of 2014.

7              Q    Most people have never heard of a nicotine

8         dependence center. How many are there in this

9         country?

10              A    There are very few. There are more now

11         than there were when we started this one back in

12          1988, because we do train. Education is part of

13         what we do. So we train ï¿½ we're called now tobacco

14         treatment specialists, people that focus on treating

15         tobacco dependence for the serious medical problem

16         that it is.

17              Q    So why have you created a center in

18         Rochester where you train folks to go out and become

19         nicotine addiction specialists? Why is that 2 0        something that's necessary in this country?

21              A    Well, left untreated, tobacco dependence

22         will kill over 60 percent of the smokers. That's a 2 3        study that's just ï¿½ actually three studies just

2 4        recently showed that. We recognize it for the

2 5        serious medical problem that it was back in the

Page   1620

1         1980s, that's when we started this program.

2                   I got a phone call in the same half day

3         from two services, one in dermatology, one in

4         vascular medicine, with patients who had ischemic

5         ulcers. Because of vascular disease, they had a

6         breakdown of their skin, they had an ulcer. And the

7         question was, what do we have to offer these

8         patients to help them stop smoking? And the answer

9         was nothing. So that's when we got the group

10         together to try to figure out how to treat this.

11              Q    So that was the background of the

12         origination ï¿½

13              A    Well, it goes back a little further than

14         that, because I went through the smoker's clinic as

15         a smoker myself in 1975, stopped smoking on

16         November 22nd, 1975, and then went back as a

17         counselor at the smoker's clinic because I had

18         training in addictions, and then that allowed me to

19         really learn more about this. So I became known as 2 0        someone that had some expertise in tobacco.

21                   I went on to become the medical director

22         of the smoker's clinic. And then that fateful day 2 3        when I had two phone calls in the same half day 2 4        about patients that we did not have any treatment 2 5        for them at all.

1              Q    And from 1988 until you recently retired,

2         were you consistently throughout that period of time

3         the head of the Rochester, Minnesota, Mayo Clinic

4         tobacco center?

5              A    Yes, I was, from the beginning to July

6         of ï¿½ or January of 2014.

7              Q    Why did you retire? Congratulations,

8         first. Why did you retire?

9              A    Well, it was time. You know, one of the

10         things we want to do is to enjoy our grandchildren.

11         I have several of those. And that's really a lot of

12         fun.

13                   But it was time. I had done this for

14         basically 26 years in focusing on tobacco

15         dependence, and there was a need for another person

16         to take this up and to manage it. So we had good

17         succession planning and have a really good director

18         now and a good staff.

19              Q    Since you've retired, are you just done

2 0        with just talking about and studying and lecturing

21         on nicotine and tobacco?

22              A    Am I done?

23              Q    Yeah.

2 4             A   No. No. In fact, next week I will be

2 5        going to Hong Kong. We have a training program

Page   1622

1         there to teach physicians in other places around the

2         world on how to treat tobacco dependence because we

3         have learned how to do it so well and are able to

4         train other people on this particular topic.

5              Q   What takes place? We're talking about a

6         nicotine dependence center, but what exactly is

7         that? What happens there?

8              A    Well, when we started this program, we got

9         a group of people together to try to figure out what

10         the best model was, and the best model was right

11         next door in the addictions treatment program that

12         treated alcoholism, cocaine dependence, and other

13         drug dependencies.

14                   And the model is counselor-provided

15         services under the supervision of a physician. So

16         we now have what we call tobacco treatment

17         specialists, who are counselors, and they are the

18         ones that see the patients first, spend about an

19         hour with them to do an assessment of them and to 2 0        develop a treatment plan for them, and then they

21        consult with us about what medications might be

2 2        needed.

2 3                 There are four internists in the Nicotine

2 4        Dependence Center. So we rotate through and help

2 5        the counselors to develop the treatment plan when it

26    (Pages   1619   to   1622)

1         comes to the pharmacotherapy, or any medical

2         questions that come up as well.

3                   So we have individual face-to-face

4         treatment for patients who are outpatients, we have

5         individual face-to-face treatment for people that

6         are hospitalized for other reasons, and then we have

7         a residential treatment program where patients are

8         admitted for eight days of very intensive treatment

9         just like a person would be admitted for cocaine

10         dependence or alcohol dependence. And it is very

11         much modeled after that addiction treatment model.

12              Q    I think you were talking about it at the

13         end there.

14                   Is there an aspect of the center that's

15         actually in-patient?

16              A    Well, we talk residential because it's

17         not ï¿½ we don't have nurses on the floor. There's

18         staff on the floor full-time, and the patients have

19         to be able to manage their own medicines and things, 2 0        because an in-patient treatment program would be

21        very expensive, and so a residential treatment

2 2        program is kind of one cut below that. But most of

2 3        the addiction units around the country that treat

2 4        other addictions now are more residential in their

2 5        orientation.

Page   1624

1               Q    Let's take a look at number 21. We'll put

2         up a slide.

3                    And you can explain to the jury just the

4         volume of the folks you've seen over the years.

5                    So what do we see here?

6              A    Well, so we started in April of 1988. We

7         saw 135 or so patients in that first month. And

8         that's what initial counseling means. That's the

9         first session that the counselor has, it lasts for

10         about an hour, and they look through the medical

11         record and they write notes in the medical record,

12         just like they would if they were any other service

13         provider.

14                    So the initial counseling could take place

15         in the outpatient area or in the hospital. So since

16         April of 1988, we've treated over 52,000 patients

17         that have had initial counseling.

18                    And then follow-up counseling is good,

19         too, because we know that the more we do, the more 2 0        counseling is provided, the more intensive it is,

21        the longer it is, the more often it is, the better

2 2        the outcome.

2 3                  So the follow-up counseling shows 24,000

2 4        or so. That reflects the fact that in Rochester,

2 5        it's a regional medical center, so most patients

Electronically signed by Gina Rodriguez (201-182-126-9514)

Page   1625

1         come from outside of Homestead County, which is the

2         county where we live. About half come from

3         Minnesota, but Minnesota is a very tall state, so

4         they can't always come back for follow-up

5         counseling. So about half of the patients get a

6         follow-up visit.

7                   And then the bottom line is the

8         residential treatment program, which I explained is

9         an eight-day program. They're admitted on a Friday,

10         dismissed on the following Friday. We mn that once

11         a month, and we can accommodate about 11 patients at

12         a time.

13                   So those are the treatment options that we

14         have available to the patients in Rochester.

15              Q    Do people come historically across the

16         country to your facility at the Mayo Clinic in order

17         to overcome their nicotine addiction?

18              A    They do. And, in fact, that's probably

19         more reflected in the residential treatment program

2 0        because they do come from all over. Because there's

21        only two of them in the country that have

2 2        residential treatment for tobacco dependence.

23            Q    What's the other one?

2 4            A    In California. And it's located in the

2 5        Napa Valley overlooking the vineyards. And so it's

Page   1626

1         hard to get people to come to Minnesota sometimes,

2         but we do provide really good treatment.

3              Q    You had your deposition taken in this

4         case?

5              A    Pardon?

6              Q    You had your deposition taken in this

7         case? Do you remember that?

8              A    Yeah.

9              Q    Some folks had to fly out to Minnesota for

10         your deposition.

11              A    True.

12              Q    On the scale, you look at numbers like

18              Q    Okay. How would you rate the numbers of

19         folks in this country who are addicted to nicotine

2 0        in cigarettes made by these defendants as compared

21        to the other addictive substances that are legal in

2 2        this country?

23             A    Well, there are ï¿½ we frequently talk

2 4        about the prevalence of smoking has gone down a lot

25        in the last 50 years, since the first Surgeon

	General's report in 1964, but the absolute number of
	1
	then was nicotine gum.

2
	smokers in the country is basically the same as it
	2
	And then relapse prevention is preventing

3
	was 50 years ago, over 43 million smokers. And of
	3
	relapse. And what we found was that people in the

4
	those 43 million, the majority are addicted.
	4
	addictions field call that ï¿½ in the tobacco

5
	Q    And I asked you a question a minute ago to
	5
	dependence field, we call that relapse prevention,

6
	compare the rates of, you know, not the rates, but
	6
	and in the addiction field, they call it aftercare.

7
	the numbers, the volume of addicts to nicotine,
	7
	So a different name for the same thing. So those

8
	people who are addicted to nicotine, compared to
	8
	sorts of things really resonated with the patients.

9
	other legal addictive substances.
	9
	And then the final thing is motivational

10
	How about some other illegal substances
	10
	interviewing, which has been most recently, in the

11
	that are illicit drugs, how do the rates compare?
	11
	last ten years or so, the concept of meeting the

12
	A    Well, so alcohol would be probably the
	12
	patient where the patient is rather than telling the

13
	best example because it is more commonly used than
	13
	patient where to go. And that's really a whole new

14
	any of the other drugs. But if you look at the
	14
	way of treatment for not only this but other

15
	number of regular users of alcohol, the number that
	15
	disorders as well.

16
	are ï¿½ would be classified as alcoholic or alcohol
	16
	Q    What is pharmacotherapy, you mentioned it,

17
	dependent would be probably less than 7 percent
	17
	what is that?

18
	total of the total number of regular drinkers.
	18
	A   Well, pharmacotherapy are medications that

19
	But people who are smokers, the majority,
	19
	are proven to be safe and effective in helping

20
	and there are various numbers, but between 60 and
	20
	people to stop smoking. The first one was nicotine

21
	70 percent would be classified as tobacco dependent.
	21
	gum in the early 1980s, and the nicotine patches

22
	So it's really different, it's a different
	22
	came out in 1991. Bupropion, which is another drug,  jj

23
	scale altogether.
	23
	came out in the late 1990s, and then most recently

24
	Q    Let's take a look at slide number 19,
	24
	Varenicline came out in 2006.

25
	please. I think this is a little bit what you
	25
	Those are medications that are

	Page   1630     jj

1
	talked about regarding the treatment program.
	1
	specifically for people who are tobacco dependent to

2
	Outpatient, in-patient, residential.
	2
	help them stop smoking and relieve withdrawal

3
	A   Yeah. In the approach we use, the thing
	3
	symptoms and craving.

4
	that we added to the approach that was commonly used
	4
	Q    And over the course of your professional

5
	in the 1980s to treat smokers, which was mainly
	5
	career, have you prescribed those medications to

6
	behavioral treatment because that's really all we
	6
	addicts?

7
	had, so behavioral treatment is really important.
	7
	A   I have.

8
	It changes the behavior, recognizing the cues to
	8
	Q    And have they sometimes been successful?

9
	smoke and the triggers.
	9
	A   Yes. And what we have learned over the

10
	But we incorporated the addictions
	10
	years is that we need to use more than one at a

11
	approach, in part because of our experience with
	11
	time, so a combination of pharmacotherapy is the

12
	other dmgs of dependence early in my career. And
	12
	rule rather than the exception. Using more

13
	that was new, no one had really done that before, to
	13
	nicotine ï¿½ more than one nicotine patch at a time

14
	incorporate the concept of addictive disorder into a
	14
	for people who are heavier smokers is more common   jj

15
	treatment program.
	15
	now because we've done research to show that it

16
	So what we found in the smoker's clinic
	16
	works better if you use more.

17
	was when we talked about rationalization and denial
	17
	So more is better, longer is better,

18
	among the smokers like you would if you were talking
	18
	combinations are better. So we really have been at

19
	to a group of alcoholics, they understood that, and
	19
	the forefront of the pharmacotherapy for tobacco

20
	they understood protecting their supply and making
	20
	dependence.

21
	sure that they had adequate supplies. So we
	21
	Q    Are some of the people that you treat at

	incorporated the philosophy and the treatment
	22
	the Mayo Clinic for nicotine dependence cancer

	approach of addictions into this new model.
	23
	patients?

24
	And then pharmacotherapy was in its
	24
	A   Yes.

25
	infancy in the 1980s. The only thing we really had
	25
	Q    Okay. And are some of those folks lung

1         cancer patients?

2              A    Yes.

3              Q    And so what's the relationship between the

4         nicotine dependence that you're treating them for

5         and the lung cancer that they have?

6              A   Well, they're tied together because no one

7         has become a smoker smoking cigarettes that did not

8         contain nicotine. So nicotine is the driving force

9         behind the addiction, and the reinforcement of the

10         hit of nicotine from cigarettes is what keeps the

11         person smoking. And it just happens to be

12         incorporated into a product that has 7,000

13         chemicals, over 60 known carcinogens.

14                    So nicotine is a driving force, but the

15         product is what ends up killing people from lung

16         cancer and other cancers as well as other things.

17               Q    Okay. Is there something called the

18         Center for Tobacco-Free Living at the Mayo Clinic?

19              A    There is.

2 0             Q    What is that?

21             A    So we started this program over in one of

2 2        the older buildings on the campus, and that's

2 3        actually where the residential treatment is located

2 4        on the fourth floor of the Colonial Building.

2 5                  But a few years ago the Gonda Building

Page   1632

1         opened up, which was a new building, and the

2         pulmonary medicine group asked if we wanted to have

3         a presence on that floor, and we said yes. And so

4         that became what you see in front of you, which is

5         called the Center for Tobacco-Free Living.

6                   We did focus groups of patients who were

7         coming to be seen at the Nicotine Dependence Center

8         to find out what they wanted to see in this center

9         and what they didn't want to see in the center.

10                   What they didn't want to see in the center

11         were things like lung cancer and emphysema and heart

12         disease. What they really wanted to see is why is

13         it so hard for me to stop smoking and other people

14         can stop smoking without too much difficulty? And

15         they also wanted to know that we knew what we were

16         doing. The science of quitting had to be part of

17         the equation.

18                   So this opened up about four years ago,

19         and it's a place where you see patients, but it's 2 0        also a walk-in for patients to go to learn more

21         about their tobacco dependence.

22              Q    Why is it so hard for some people to stop 2 3        smoking?

1         BY MR. GDANSK!:

2              Q    When you had to explain to people the

3         difficulties that they have in quitting smoking in

4         the Center for Tobacco-Free Living, how did you

5         explain that?

6              A    Well, over on the right-hand side is the

7         anatomy of addiction. And I think I have a slide

8         that shows a bigger picture of that.

9                   And so why is it so hard? It's hard

10         because the cigarette is the most elegant drug

11         delivery device that's ever been invented. It gets

12         nicotine to the brain within five heartbeats, from

13         here to there. It produces a spike of nicotine in

14         the arterial system and it activates these receptors

15         in the brain releasing a substance called dopamine.

16         Dopamine is the pleasure neurotransmitter.

17                   And the second thing that those very high

18         concentrations of nicotine do is to cause the

19         receptors to change. There are physically more of 2 0        them. So the more receptors that are present, the

21        more often they have to be ï¿½ have the hit of

2 2        nicotine, and that reinforcement comes because of

2 3        the pleasure.

2 4                 So some people smoke to avoid withdrawal

2 5        symptoms, other people smoke for the pleasure. Most

Page   1634

1         people smoke for both reasons.

2                   So the brains of people who are addicted

3         smokers are altered. They have more of these

4         receptors compared to a person who is a nonsmoker, a

5         nonaddicted smoker.

6              Q    Do we have other slides and some videos to

7         show the jury tomorrow about the actual chemistry

8         and the process by which that occurs?

9              A    Okay.

10              Q    Okay. You mentioned earlier that you had

11         reviewed materials in this case. Just so we're all

12         clear what role you had in this case, did you review

13         Mr. Perrotto's medical records?

14              A    I did.

15              Q    Did you also review some of the

16         depositions of some of the family members, Debbie

17         Perrotto, his brother, his ex-wife, other folks?

18              A    Yes.

19              Q    And did that give you a good solid

2 0        significant insight into answering some of the

21         questions that the jury needs to answer in this

22         case?

23              A    They did.

2 4             Q    Where did you go to college?

25             A    Pardon?

1              Q    Where did you go to college?

2              A    Murray State University in Kentucky.

3         Western Kentucky.

4              Q    How about medical school?

5              A    University of Louisville.

6              Q    And what did you do after medical school?

7              A    I did an internship at Baptist Hospital in

8         Memphis, Tennessee, and then I got drafted, spent

9         ten years in the Army, and then went to Mayo Clinic

10         for training in 1973.

11              Q    And what did you do in the Army?

12              A    I was at an Army depot in eastern

13         Kentucky, and I was what's called a post surgeon. I

14         didn't do surgery, that was just the title that we

15         had. So I was the main medical officer for this

16         very large Army depot, which was a munitions depot.

17              Q    Are there professional organizations or

18         rating services that rate the pre-eminence or esteem

19         of certain hospitals in this country?

2 0             A    The one that's probably the most

21        publicized is the U.S. News & World Report, which

2 2        comes out every year.

2 3             Q    And where does the Mayo Clinic rate on

2 4        that scale?

2 5             A    Well, up until this year, we were always

Page   1636

1         rated number two or number three, but this year

2         we're number one.

3              Q    And is the Mayo Clinic recognized both

4         nationally and internationally as a leader in

5         medicine?

6              A    It is.

7               Q    And not trying to get you to brag, but is

8         there a good reason for that?

9              A    Well, as I mentioned earlier, it's the

10         integration of practice, education and research that

11         really makes the place special.

12                    But the Mayo brothers, they were

13         renaissance people, they were very smart, they were

14         really great surgeons, and that's what they wanted

15         to do was to do surgeries. So they collected around

16         them people that did all the other things and they

17         delegated the other things to the other people. So

18         it was always a team effort that they worked

19         together.

2 0                  And so lots and lots of people came to

21        Rochester, and the Mayo brothers made a lot of

2 2        money. And then in 1917, they gave it to ï¿½ they

2 3        established the Mayo Foundation for Education and

2 4        Research, they gave their fortune to do that, and

2 5        that became a legacy for them and basically an

1         endowment.

2                   The other thing they did at that time,

3         which was a really critical thing, was they mandated

4         that everyone that was a physician at Mayo Clinic

5         would have to go on salary, including themselves and

6         including their son, who was now on staff. And that

7         really did something that's pretty unique, that made

8         it so we could work together as a team. There's no

9         profit motive, there's no advantage to doing more

10         things or fewer things. So the focus is on doing

11         whatever is necessary for that patient and nothing

12         more and nothing less. And that was really a

13         critical element in the origins of what we now call

14         Mayo Clinic Rochester.

15              Q    Is that the way it still is at the Mayo

16         Clinic, the doctors are salary, so there's no

17         incentive to do extra surgeries or less surgeries or

18         anything like that?

19              A    That's correct. But everyone doesn't get

2 0        paid the same. So the radiologists make more money

21        than the rest of us do. The internists and family

2 2        physicians are kind of at the lower end. So it is

23        based on the market of the individual specialty. So

2 4        I was on kind of the lower end of the totem pole, if

2 5        you will, the feeding chain.

Page   1638

1              Q    Because you are an internist?

2              A    Yes.

3              Q    So what is an internist? After you

4         graduated medical school, did you have to get

5         specialty training in internal medicine?

6              A    I did three years of internal medicine

7         training at Mayo Clinic. So that means we did

8         rotations through, like, hematology and cardiology

9         and gastroenterology and other ologies that are all

10         internal medicine focus.

11                   So an internist is a nonsurgical, doesn't

12         do pediatrics, doesn't do OB-GYN, does outpatient

13         hospital care. So if s really more diagnostic and

14         treating with medications and other things rather

15         than doing surgery.

16              Q    As an internist, do you come into contact

17         with patients who have chronic obstructive pulmonary

18         disease?

19              A    Well, as I mentioned earlier, in the first 2 0        part of my career, I was a primary care internist, 21        so that was ï¿½ my daily life was seeing patients

2 2        with all kinds of different things, including

2 3        emphysema or COPD, heart disease, ulcers, and other

2 4        things.

	Dependence Center in 1988,1 was doing that
	1
	Q   As best as you are aware, have you seen

2
	half-time and doing research and doing practice,
	2
	over a thousand, thousands of people who you really

3
	too, so I was still seeing patients until the early
	3
	treated for their nicotine addiction, tobacco

4
	part of the 1990s when it got to be too much.
	4
	dependence?

5
	Q    When you switched over in '88 and founded
	5
	A   It's several thousand, but again, I can't

6
	the tobacco research ï¿½ the Nicotine Dependence
	6
	give you an accurate number.

7
	Center, have you continued since then to see
	7
	Q    Are you board-certified in any medical

8
	patients within the center?
	8
	specialties?

9
	A    Oh, yes. Well, so my primary care
	9
	A    Internal medicine is my board

10
	practice, I had to stop doing that in the mid 1990s
	10
	certification, and I'm also certified in addiction

11
	because there was too much to do at the Nicotine
	11
	medicine through the American Society of Addiction

12
	Dependence Center. So as I mentioned earlier, the
	12
	Medicine.

13
	supervising physicians that oversee the counselors
	13
	Q    So what does it mean, you are the first

14
	see patients regularly, and we rotate amongst the
	14
	medical doctor the jurors are hearing from, and they

15
	four of us the staffing of the residential program.
	15
	will hear about this probably throughout the trial,

16
	So I have been doing that every year since 1991 on a
	16
	board certification. What does it mean to be

17
	rotational basis with the other physicians.
	17
	board-certified in a medical specialty?

18
	Q    The term "dependence," it's called the
	18
	A   Well, there are prerequisites. You have

19
	Nicotine Dependence Center, is that synonymous from
	19
	to have a certain amount of training. So for

20
	your perspective with the term "addiction"?
	20
	internal medicine, it's a minimum of three years. I

21
	A   It is, and we use those terms
	21
	had four years. I did an extra year of training.

22
	interchangeably. And so dependence and addiction
	22
	So a minimum three years in internal medicine.

23
	are basically the same.
	23
	And then you take a board certification

24
	Q    Is there any medically significant
	24
	examination, which is made up by people at the

25
	difference from your perspective?
	25
	American Board of Internal Medicine. So you have to  j;


	Page   1640
	
	Page   1642     \

1
	A   No, the ï¿½ we actually like the word
	1
	have the adequate training, but also then pass the

2
	"dependence" because it's really more descriptive,
	2
	test.

3
	and were we to rename the place today, we would
	3
	Q    And you said you're board-certified by the

4
	probably call it "tobacco dependence treatment
	4
	American Board of Internal Medicine?

5
	program" or "tobacco dependence center," because
	5
	A    That is correct.

6
	tobacco is the thing that ends up killing the
	6
	Q    And is that current to today?

7
	patient, it's not the nicotine that kills the
	7
	A    Say that again?

8
	patient. So we would probably name it differently.
	8
	Q    Are you still certified by their

9
	But it has a brand of its own now, so it would be
	9
	organization?

10
	too late in the game to change that.
	10
	A    Yes.

11
	Q    Over the course of your professional
	11
	Q    For how long have you been certified in

12
	career, how many patients do you think you've seen
	12
	internal medicine, board-certified?

13
	discussed, talked to, and diagnosed with nicotine
	13
	A    Since 1975.

14
	addiction, tobacco dependence?
	14
	Q    Then you said you are board-certified by

15
	A    I don't have any idea. It's thousands,
	15
	the American Society of Addiction Medicine.

16
	but I don't ï¿½ no one's ever kept track of that.
	16
	A    It's a certification, it's not a board.

17
	We did have one counselor who started out
	17
	That was before there was a board of addiction

18
	with our program at the very beginning, he just
	18
	medicine, which came on just in the last several

19
	retired this year too, so we were able to go back
	19
	years.

20
	and count up the number of patients he had seen.
	20
	So the American Society of Addiction

21
	And he, as an individual, has probably seen more
	21
	Medicine had a certifying examination, and so I was \

22
	patients than anybody else on the planet. So he was
	22
	involved with American Society of Addiction

23
	there at the beginning and just retired. So it's
	23
	Medicine, well, for ï¿½ well, since the 1980s. And

24
	thousands, but I couldn't give you an accurate
	24
	so the certification examination is something that I

25
	number.
	25
	took and passed.

	BY MR. GDANSKI:

7
	very interested in making sure that the society knew

	about tobacco dependence.

	medical epidemic? As a physician, what does it mean \

9
	One of my friends, John Slade, was the

	to be a medical epidemic?

10
	main driving force behind that. But he collected a

	A   Well, it has to be something that's

11
	bunch of us together to help the American Society of
	11
	basically catastrophic, it affects lots and lots of

12
	Addiction Medicine understand that tobacco
	12
	people, and so back in the dark ages there was the

13
	dependence is a serious medical problem and a
	13
	epidemics that took place with infectious diseases;

14
	serious addiction and needs treatment, and that's

	we're in the middle of one right now with the Ebola

	least ï¿½ "if cigarettes were illegal, like

	that smoking is an addiction.

8
	If Your Honor found that to be overly

9
	prejudicial, I would respectfully disagree, of

	As a matter of fact, people who are addicted to

	10
	morphine and heroin and cocaine know very well i

11
	Surgeon General's report on nicotine addiction.
	11
	that these are addictions; yet 30 percent of

12
	THE COURT: No, that's fine.
	12
	those people give up that addiction on their

	MR. GDANSKI: Yeah, so I'm not - I guess

14
	we need to maybe see what we're fussing about

	This transcript is confusing a little bit

	SPEAKER: But is there really a comparison

21
	heroin and the cocaine, that is the third major
	21
	in intensity? Because the first thing a layman

22
	conclusion in the report, the third conclusion
	22
	hears on hearing this comparison is, but heroin

23
	as to the pharmacological effects of nicotine
	23
	and cocaine are really serious drugs, and

24
	are similar in action to heroin and cocaine.

3                   We think the prejudicial value ï¿½ the

4              probative value, we also think that this is

5              hearsay. We also think this is Dr. Koop coming

6              in here and giving opinions that are the same

7              opinions that we're hearing from the witness

8              stand, but we can't cross-examine Dr. Koop on

9              any of this. We think it's hearsay and we

10              think it's overly prejudicial.

11                   THE COURT: Mr. Gdanski.

12                   MR. GDANSKI: It's not hearsay, it's more

13              than 20 years old so, A, it would satisfy

14              hearsay exception as an ancient statement or

15              ancient document, which all it needs to satisfy

16              that is to be in excess of 20 years old.

17              That's the only threshold criteria to meet that

18              hearsay objection under the ï¿½

19                   THE COURT: The 403 was my earlier ruling. 2 0                   MR. GDANSKI: Yeah and so under 403

21             it's ï¿½ it can't possibly be that the

2 2             prejudicial value of that outweighs the

2 3             probative value to such degree where it's

2 4             unfairly prejudicial to the defense.

2 5                 The Surgeon General's report compares

Page   1656

1              nicotine addiction to heroin and cocaine. It's

2              not like that is some kind of, you know,

3              concept that has been removed from the case.

4               The idea that nicotine addiction is comparable

5              in its physiologic and pharmacologic effects to

6              heroin and cocaine, it's part of the evidence

7               in the record in this case.

8                    The fact of the matter is the tobacco

9              companies saw that, they had that information,

10               they had it in their own internal company

11               documents, their own internal documents discuss

12               the similarities between opiates and nicotine;

13               and then if they are able to demonstrate a

14               similarity between opiates and nicotine, they

15              will want to shut down and bury that research,

16              and then if they can't, then they will want to

17               support their research.

18                    So there is an ongoing discussion

19              internally in the tobacco industry about

2 0             nicotine and its relationship and similarities

21             to opiates and heroin and cocaine.

2 2                  There is an ongoing discussion publicly

2 3             about it. Dr. Koop's giving his position; a

2 4             few days later cigarette companies come in and

2 5             say, following Dr. Koop's report is nonsense,

Page   1658

1                   MR. CHESIN: - how at least from our

2              perspective it is different this time.

3                   THE COURT: Of course.

4                   MR. CHESIN: So the next exhibit that I

5              want to object to is the videos from the Waxman

6              hearings.

7                   We discussed this very briefly this

8              morning, but I want to make sure our position

9              is clear.

10                   The Waxman hearings came in over objection

11              in the prior two cases, and I won't belabor the

12              arguments that were made there. The difference

13              between this case and those cases is that

14              Mr. Perrotto, unlike the smokers in other the

15              two cases, was not a smoker at the time that

16              the Waxman hearings took place.

17                   The theory on which these ï¿½ these videos

18              were admitted in the prior two trials, in large

19              part, was that there was some nexus, there was

2 0             some connection between what was happening in

21              the Waxman hearings and what was happening in

22              the lives of the smoker.

2 3                 Here, Mr. Perrotto put down his cigarettes

2 4             in late 1992, never picked them up again. He

2 5             was not influenced by what happened. He was

	8
	MR. CHESIN: - if we have an objection.

9
	filed last night; but, in a nutshell, the
	9
	I don't know.

10
	question on punitive damages in Phase 1 of this
	10
	Otherwise, that's it for Philip Morris,

11
	case is whether the conduct that harmed
	11
	but I know the others ï¿½

12
	Mr. Perrotto was sufficiently egregious to meet
	12
	THE COURT: Let me hear from the other

13
	Florida's standard for punitive liability.
	13
	defendants, please.

14
	What you instructed in the Cohen case was
	14
	MS. SCHAEFER: Certainly, Your Honor.

15
	what that means is did the plaintiff prove by
	15
	Unfortunately for Lorillard I only have

16
	clear and convincing evidence that the behavior
	16
	one document. It is actually a document that

17
	that harmed Mr. Perrotto was intentional and
	17
	was admitted in the Cohen case. It's a 1980

18
	then you define intentional.
	18
	document ï¿½ if I may approach ï¿½ I have a copy

19
	The Florida standard jury instructions for

	Phase 2, if we ever get there, they asked what
	20
	Jon, do you need one?

21
	lays out those Owens-Corning factors and say
	21
	MR. GDANSKI: I know what it is.

22
	you should consider the reprehensibility of the
	22
	MS. SCHAEFER: Yeah, I figured you did.     \

23
	conduct, whether the conduct continued for a
	23
	THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Schaefer.

24
	long period of time or not.
	24
	MS. SCHAEFER: Thank you, Your Honor.    \

25
	I'm not saying it's our position that the
	25
	Your Honor, acknowledging that this was


	Page   1660
	
	Page   16 62     jj

1
	Waxman hearings come in in Phase 2. We have
	1
	admitted in Cohen, the reason I'm raising an

2
	objections to that.
	2
	objection here is that this was not on Dr.

3
	THE COURT: I understand.
	3
	Hurt's reliance list, and so, therefore, we

4
	MR. CHESTN: But our position is that the
	4
	object to this document being used with Dr.

5
	question of whether something ï¿½ some other act
	5
	Hurt and being admitted through Dr. Hurt

6
	that didn't harm the plaintiff, the question of
	6
	because, number one, we had no idea he was

7
	whether such an act is relevant to the
	7
	going to use it, we have not had the

8
	reprehensibility analysis for punitive damages
	8
	opportunity to depose him on it, and he has not

9
	is a question to be asked when setting an
	9
	previously testified on this document.

10
	amount and not when discussing punitive
	10
	So, therefore, we're in a situation where

11
	liability or punitive entitlement.
	11
	we're prejudiced by plaintiffs failure to give

12
	So in this case, where these hearings
	12
	us notice in time for to us actually depose him

13
	didn't affect Mr. Perrotto, we think it
	13
	on the issue since this is the first we see of

14
	changes.
	14
	this with Dr. Hurt.

15
	THE COURT: I respectfully disagree with
	15
	THE COURT: Mr. Gdanski?

16
	defense counsel, and I'm going to go ahead and
	16
	MR. GDANSKI: Dr. Hurt, at his deposition,   !

	nicotine addiction, nicotine manipulation. We

19
	Other than that, the only other thing that
	19
	told them he is going to rely on the company

20
	I will say for Philip Morris ï¿½ and this isn't
	20
	documents, including this one. He has

21
	necessarily an objection ï¿½ an objection and
	21
	discussed the idea and the concept. I don't

22
	perhaps we can work this out ï¿½ I'm told that
	22
	know all of his prior history and testimony

23
	Exhibit 6129, which is a Mayo Clinic video, was
	23
	about this document specifically. It doesn't

24
	not on the plaintiffs exhibit list. And we

	So there are, I think on the first, I

3
	Relating to Lorillard, Dr. Hurt's
	3
	think coming up on Dr. Proctor's list, I think

4
	testimony has really been quite limited in his

	there are a 2010, a 2012, and 2014 Surgeon

5

6
	volunteers two facts that are completely
	6
	immediate ones that I think are coming up; and,   i;

7
	irrelevant and, in fact, he had been
	7
	obviously, reports of the Surgeon General

8
	overruled ï¿½ one has been overruled in this
	8
	issued 14, 18, 20 years after Mr. Perrotto

	case ï¿½ and that is the Kent cigarette that
	9

10
	included the asbestos in the filter, and the
	10
	They're being introduced squarely for the truth

11
	other is he will often raise issues relating to
	11
	of the matter. It's classic hearsay. It is

12
	racial marketing.
	12
	covered by Lee, covered, I would submit, by

13
	THE COURT: Let me take one at a time.
	13
	Your Honor's prior ruling in the Cohen case;

14
	He's not ï¿½ you're not going to have him
	14
	and, therefore, we make a general hearsay

15
	testify as to the Kent filter?
	15
	objection with respect to those reports.

16
	MR. GDANSKI: I will tell him not to do
	16
	THE COURT: Mr. Gdanski?

17
	either of those two things.
	17
	MR. GDANSKI: Are we going to argue this  jj

18
	THE COURT: Okay. Okay.
	18
	entire motion now? I mean, we filed a written

19
	MS. SCHAEFER: And that's all I ask, Your
	19
	response.

20
	Honor. Thank you very much.

	THE COURT: I have your written response.   \

	MR. GDANSKI: I don't have a copy here.

22
	MR. MAGUIRE: Yes, Your Honor, a more
	22
	We think that the 2010, T2, and T 4

23
	general issue that came up in Cohen and you
	23
	Surgeon General's reports are admissible, they

24
	dealt with is with respect to certain
	24
	are subject to hearsay exceptions. They're not

25
	government reports. It's hearsay. It came up
	25
	being offered to prove the truth of the matter


	Page   1668
	
	Page   167 0     \

1
	there with respect to a number of reports, FTC
	1
	asserted; they're being offered to prove the

2
	and Surgeon General reports. And Your Honor at
	2
	historical context of what took place

3
	the time looked at the Lee case from the
	3
	historically in the tobacco industry.

4
	Florida Supreme Court, ruled that it was clear
	4
	That's not notice to Mr. Perrotto

5
	and unequivocal.
	5
	obviously, he's dead, so it doesn't go to

6
	After that, there was a waiver with
	6
	notice to Mr. Perrotto, but it goes to notice

7
	respect to certain Surgeon General reports, and
	7
	to the tobacco industry.

8
	so certain Surgeon General reports came in, you
	8
	And importantly, in our papers, they cite

9
	admitted in Cohen, based on a finding of
	9
	to those reports on their websites as reliable,

10
	waiver. There is no ï¿½ we're going to make
	10
	authoritative sources of information. Those

11
	sure there's no waiver in this case with
	11
	are places that they tell people to go to to

12
	respect to that hearsay.
	12
	look for information on smoking and health.

13
	So what we have with respect to government
	13
	And so in the context of a case where the

14
	reports, we have a general hearsay exception,
	14
	defendant is telling people to go, not just go

15
	Florida Statute is very clear, Florida Supreme
	15
	there, but Lorillard's website even says, don't

16
	Court is very clear, where there are some of
	16
	listen to us, don't listen to Lorillard, listen

17
	the reports that plaintiffs use and the defense
	17
	to the Surgeon General's reports. Go to those

18
	use, not for the truth but simply as a matter
	18
	to find out the correct information on smoking

19
	of notice, because you heard about the 1964
	19
	and health. We think that that certainly

20
	report and a certain other reports.
	20
	overcomes any problem as to reliability of the

21
	THE COURT: Certainly.
	21
	reports ï¿½

22
	MR. MAGUIRE: But the smoker in this case
	22
	THE COURT: What's the hearsay exception,   ij

23
	died in 1996. And so anything that happened ï¿½
	23
	though?

24
	any reports that the Surgeon General issued
	24
	MR. GDANSKI: Yeah. So it's not - the

25
	after 1996, obviously, could not possibly be

	10
	on information from your personal physicians,

12
	and Your Honor noted that in Cohen.
	12
	and other public health authorities, and not

13
	THE COURT: What about the adoptive

	Lorillard, for information regarding the health

14
	admission?
	14
	effects of cigarette smoking, the benefits of

15

	22
	That is very different from saying, Jury,

23
	not an adoptive admission, Your Honor.
	23
	you should rely on this to indict cigarette

24
	And specifically what it does, if you look
	24
	companies and Lorillard, and you should ignore   \

25
	at the bottom of the first page, you will see

	Lorillard's vociferous objections to certain

1
	what it specifically says.
	1

	not reliable, which are controverted by

3
	physicians and other medical providers, the

	Lorillard, and which Lorillard in no way

10
	THE COURT: So certain things are adoptive
	10
	it's interesting that Lorillard is trying to

11
	admissions in the reports and not other things,
	11
	take parts of it and say, "We adopt parts of

12
	is that Lorillard's position?

	14
	MR. MAGUIRE: Could I just be heard, just

15
	with respect ï¿½ this is the critical
	15
	to finish this thought in my mind?

	13
	And I went and looked, and the way it

14
	Williamson, Reynolds, American, or BATCo, we
	14
	arose really briefly in the Tullo case, this is

15
	could only find six of those that he had
	15
	a document Dr. Cummings used as the very last   \

16
	produced, so we have a larger issue than just
	16
	document on redirect. The defendants made an

17
	the one.
	17
	oral motion for mistrial, you denied it; filed

18
	THE COURT: Do you intend to use all these
	18
	a written motion the next morning for a

19
	with Hurt?
	19
	mistrial, you denied that. And in the end, you

20
	MR. GDANSKI: I do. I just find it
	20
	wound up giving a curative instruction on that

21
	incredible to suggest that Dr. Richard Hurt,
	21
	particular one.

22
	who on Earth literally, and we'll talk about it
	22
	And part of it in the argument, and I'm

23
	tomorrow, but who on Earth discovered and
	23
	happy to hand up the transcripts if you would

24
	revealed the documents regarding nicotine
	24
	like them.

25
	addiction, this exact subject matter, you know,
	25
	THE COURT: No, I do remember that. It


	Page   1680
	
	Page   1682     \

1
	can't talk about it at the trial.
	1
	was late in the day.

2
	It's just not consistent with the reality,
	2
	MR. FLIGG: Basically, the point was, this

3
	the history of this witness and what he's done.
	3
	was a statement from a document that was not a

4
	And he's been deposed numerous times on all
	4
	defendant; it has nothing to do with the

5
	sorts of these documents.
	5
	defendants in the case, it didn't come from any

6
	So, you know, if a document by Claude
	6
	of them, so it is not a business record, it is

7
	Teague was not on the reliance list in this
	7
	hearsay, and in the end the prejudice to the

8
	case, I can't believe that that would ever be
	8
	defendants of having that kind of statement

9
	suggested to be a reason not to have Dr. Hurt
	9
	made.

10
	talk about it. What's the prejudice?
	10
	So then in Cohen, the situation came that

11
	THE COURT: What's the argument?
	11
	it was raised initially as a 403 objection, and

12
	MR. FLIGG: Well, there's 14 that we can't
	12
	at the end of the day, you had redacted the

13
	find. We had people looking through all the
	13
	larger bags of money is how it all arose.

14
	flash drives and CDs and PowerPoint
	14
	So we would contend at the outset to avoid

15
	presentations.
	15
	any of that. The proper course would just be

16
	The difference is, though, foundationally,
	16
	just to keep out this document because of the

17
	I understand Dr. Hurt can talk about the
	17
	hearsay and the prejudice. It is not a

18
	concepts of some of these ideas, but to ï¿½ you
	18
	business record of any of the defendants.

19
	know, he might not be able to ï¿½ when you put
	19
	MR. GDANSKI: It came in in Tullo. I

20
	documents up, he might read something from it
	20
	don't know what the limiting instruction even

21
	and talk about it, and he has no foundation for
	21
	was, but I remember exactly ï¿½

22
	doing it, so it becomes very different in the
	22
	THE COURT: You take the bags of money

23
	concept, in the idea versus trying to get all
	23
	off

24
	sorts of things into evidence.
	24
	MR. GDANSKI: The entire thing came in in   ij

25
	THE COURT: Okay. I'm going to overrule
	25
	Tullo with that reference with Dr. Cummings on   \

	THE COURT: And then send them any

	Your Honor wants to be consistent with Cohen ï¿½

	Hurt.

4
	THE COURT: Yeah, I am going to be
	4
	MR. GDANSKI: Sure, we will send them.

5
	consistent with Cohen. There was a hearsay
	5
	THE COURT: Who else are you going to

6
	objection, which I sustained, and then I think
	6
	have? I forgot to ask. Is Dr. Hurt going to

7
	it came out over objection, and that's why I
	7
	be all day tomorrow or do you intend to have

8
	gave the curative.

9
	MR. GDANSKI: I don't remember it that
	9
	MR. GDANSKI: Yeah, he's going to be all

10
	way, but it doesn't make a difference.
	10
	day tomorrow.

11
	If Your Honor wants to do like we did in
	11
	THE COURT: And will you finish with Hurt

12
	Cohen and take out that last sentence, you
	12
	tomorrow; do you anticipate?

13
	know, I can continue to argue until the cows
	13
	MR. GDANSKI: If I can move quickly, I

14
	come home, but you're going to do as you did in
	14
	would like to get him home.

15
	Cohen. So I'm not going to waste your time.
	15
	THE COURT: I figured he might go home.

16
	MR. FLIGG: And I just wanted to point
	16
	MR. GDANSKI: Yeah. I'm going to try to

17
	out, and Mr. Gdanski may remember, the curative
	17
	do that as best as we possibly can.

18
	instruction's intent was: "Yesterday the last
	18
	THE COURT: So we're going to start at

19
	question asked of Dr. Cummings involved a
	19
	9 o'clock tomorrow morning.

20
	document that was written by British American
	20
	MR. GDANSKI: Yeah. Let me ask about one   ;

21
	Tobacco Company, which is not a defendant in
	21
	thing, and this is personal. If we can't

22
	this litigation."
	22
	finish Dr. Hurt tomorrow, can we break at 4:30

23
	And that's the problem, they're not a
	23
	so I can get back before the Sabbath starts?

24
	defendant in this litigation, and so bringing
	24
	If it's between that and finishing, I'd just as

25
	the document out, which goes to our other
	25
	soon finish the guy and whatever.

	motion about the other BATCo documents, they
	1
	THE COURT: If we're within two or three

2
	weren't a defendant in Engle, they're not a
	2
	questions, that's fine; but otherwise, you know

3
	defendant here, and they're trying to use that
	3
	I have always been very respectful, and I will

4
	and apply it and say, "This is all part of the
	4
	be the same in this trial as well.

5
	conspiracy to bolster the conspiracy," and it
	5
	MR. GDANSKI: I will let them know where I   \

6
	is not, it is prejudicial to all of the
	6
	am, and Mr. Cofer, he said he doesn't have a

7
	defendants sitting here.
	7
	long cross, but that might just not be the way

8
	MR. GDANSKI: Your Honor has overruled
	8
	it plays. We'll see what happens.

9
	that objection already, which has become one
	9
	THE COURT: I am willing to do the same

10
	sentence to be a bit too far, and that one
	10
	thing. All right? Have a good evening,

11
	sentence was redacted.
	11
	everyone. We'll see everyone tomorrow.

12
	But the general idea that British American
	12
	(The proceedings adjourned at 5:00 p.m.)

13
	Tobacco Company documents are out has been
	13
	

14
	passed on and ruled on and objected by Your
	14
	

15
	Honor.
	15
	

16
	THE COURT: Correct. I will be consistent
	16
	

17
	with that.

18
	Anything else for the evening; otherwise,
	18
	

19
	we'll pick up tomorrow.
	19
	

20
	MR. FLIGG: I just want to clarify, then
	20
	

21
	that particular document will be redacted.
	21
	

22
	THE COURT: It's been redacted.
	22
	

23
	And can you show them the redacted
	23
	

24
	document?
	24
	

25
	MR. GDANSKI: Yes, of course.

	MR. COFER: And then the last thing, just

7
	004, and it's from the Surgeon General's
	7
	for the record, we gave written objections to

8
	report, 1989, and it says: Two additional

	the documents. I want to make sure that those

9
	factors make smoking among young people a

	were ï¿½

10
	preeminent public health concern. One, the age
	10
	THE COURT: Yes.

11
	of initiation of smoking; and, two, the
	11
	MR. COFER: -reserved.

12
	nicotine addiction, ellipses. These two
	12
	THE COURT: Those were filed with the

13
	factors refute the argument that smoking is a
	13
	clerk?

14
	matter of free choice, and that's underscored,
	14
	MR. CHESIN: They have been filed. And

15
	that's just argument.
	15
	so, before we start introducing documents with

16
	THE COURT: That's not from the Surgeon
	16
	this witness ï¿½

17
	General's report?
	17
	THE COURT: Just for the record, I'm

18
	MR. GDANSKI: It is from the Surgeon
	18
	going to go ahead and overrule defendants'

19
	General's report.
	19
	written objections now that they've been

20
	THE COURT: The last sentence is from the
	20
	formally filed with the clerk. Okay. So we

21
	Surgeon General's ï¿½
	21
	have a clean record.

22
	MR. GDANSKI: The entire thing is
	22
	Yes?

23
	straight from the Surgeon General's report,
	23
	MR. WEAVER: As well, the oral objections   I

24
	which ï¿½
	24
	that were made last night about the late

25
	THE COURT: No; I know we discussed it

	last night. So that last sentence is ï¿½
	1
	assume the Court's ruling will stay the same,

2
	MR. GDANSK!: It's a 1989 Surgeon
	2
	as well.

	General's report, right after the nicotine

	THE COURT: Ruling remains the same.

	addiction report from '88.
	4
	MR. WEAVER: There was one slide that

5
	THE COURT: Okay.
	5
	Reynolds had an issue with, that Mr. Gdanski

6
	MR. GDANSK!: We put it into evidence in
	6
	has assured me he is not going to use with the

7
	other cases, including the ones before Your
	7
	witness, so that's taken care of; and there are

	knowledge, been excluded from evidence for
	9
	tobacco, I guess, under a microscope, that we

	10
	would simply request that a proper foundation

11
	MR. COFER: But it's still just argument.
	11
	be laid before they're displayed to the jury.

12
	It's one thing ï¿½
	12
	MR. GDANSK!: No issue.

13
	MR. GDANSK!: It's science.
	13
	THE COURT: That's not an issue?

14
	MR. COFER: Well, no. The -
	14
	Okay. That's fine.

15
	These two factors refute the argument
	15
	Yes, Ms. Schaefer?

16
	that smoking is a matter of free choice.
	16
	MS. SCHAEFER: Oh, nothing else on Hurt.    1

17
	That's one of the issues in this case.
	17
	THE COURT: Okay.

18
	In the Douglas case, the Court said that
	18
	MS. SCHAEFER: I just wanted to let Your

19
	you look at why someone smoked, whether they
	19
	Honor know, we did receive additional records.

20
	smoked because they chose to smoke, whether
	20
	I handed them to the clerk.

21
	they smoked because they were addicted. And,
	21
	THE COURT: Okay. I'll go through them.

22
	essentially, this is just argument, policy

	MS. SCHAEFER: And we also -

	requested letters for your employers, and I've

	Q.    So what do you do as a peer reviewer?

11
	signed letters for all your employers. And I'm
	11
	A.    Well, we receive articles that have been

12
	very impressed that some of you have three jobs
	12
	submitted to a journal, and then we act as referees.

13
	and you're still willing to serve. I think
	13
	We, basically, criticize the article or give it

14
	that's incredible. So thank you so much for
	14
	accolades, and critique it, basically, and send those

15
	doing your work and being here and serving all
	15
	comments back to the journal for them to decide

	of us.
	16
	whether or not to accept it for publication.

	23
	research grants, it lists awards, it lists all kinds

24
	Doctor, you're still under oath.
	24
	of different things. It, basically, is the body of

	Q.    Have you also published articles in a

13
	tobacco use, dependence, the kind of issues that we're
	13
	publication called Addiction?

14
	talking about in this case?
	14
	A.    Yes.

15
	A.    The majority. Early on in my career, I
	15
	Q.    What is that publication?

16
	did more work with alcohol and other drugs of
	16
	A.    It's, basically, focused on addiction.

17
	dependence, but also some other medical articles that
	17
	It spans the whole range of addictions.

18
	had to do with different things that came up during my
	18
	There are other journals, called

19
	practice; but in the latter part, the ï¿½ 20, 25 years
	19
	Alcoholism, and that focuses mainly on alcoholism; but jj

20
	or so, it was mostly all tobacco related.
	20
	then Addiction focuses on the broad range of

21
	Q.    And can you give the jury a flavor of
	21
	addictions, including tobacco dependence.

22
	some of the journals that you've published in?
	22
	Q.    Have you been a reviewer for some of

23
	A.    Well, we rank journals according to their
	23
	those journals?

24
	impact factor. So the one that has the highest impact
	24
	A.    I have.

25
	factor would be the New England Journal of Medicine.
	25
	Q.    Have you been a reviewer for a journal


	Page   1705
	
	Page   17 07     \

1
	The Lancet, the Journal of the American Medical
	1
	called Tobacco Control?

2
	Association, Annals of Internal Medicine, all have
	2
	A.    Yes.

3
	high impact factors. And those would be some of the
	3
	Q.    What is that?

4
	ones we've published in.
	4
	A.    Well, Tobacco Control is a relatively new

5
	Q.    Have you published articles in the New
	5
	journal, probably ten or maybe 15 years old, that has

6
	England Journal of Medicine on nicotine addiction or
	6
	to do with tobacco, and it's more policy oriented and

7
	tobacco use?
	7
	it has a lot to do with the industry.

8
	A.    Yes.
	8
	Q.    Okay. Have you authored publications and

9
	Q.    And have you done that also in the
	9
	been a reviewer for publications dealing with

10
	Journal of the American Medical Association?
	10
	epidemiology?

11
	A.    Yes.
	11
	A.    Yes.

12
	Q.    That's call JAMA sometimes?
	12
	Q.    And have you been a reviewer for a

13
	A.    Uh-huh.
	13
	journal called the American Journal of Epidemiology?

14
	Q.    Have you also published articles -
	14
	A.    Yes.

15
	I think you said "Lancet." What is
	15
	Q.    Can you tell the jury, what is

16
	Lancet?
	16
	epidemiology?

17
	A.    The Lancet is the ï¿½ kind of the British
	17
	A.    Epidemiology is the science of

18
	counterpart to the New England Journal of Medicine.
	18
	determining disease incidence. So, for example, in

19
	It's the premier general medicine journal from the UK.
	19
	Homestead County, where we reside, we have what's

20
	It ranks up ï¿½ very high, right up there with the New
	20
	called the Rochester Epidemiology Project, which keeps   j!

21
	England Journal of Medicine.
	21
	track of all the diseases that afflict individuals, so

22
	Q.    Have you published medical articles in
	22
	we can calculate the incidence of a disease.

23
	the journal called Pediatrics?
	23
	So "incidence" is the number of cases per

24
	A.    Yes.
	24
	hundred thousand population per year. And that gives

25
	Q.    And did that have to do with nicotine
	25
	us an idea of whether or not the disease is going up

	Q.    And can you just describe that process,

10
	to it.
	10
	what role you have in training people who are going to

11
	A.    Well, that journal has to do with

	go out across the country and have responsibility of

12
	psychiatric illnesses, obviously, and we have
	12
	treating patients for nicotine addiction or tobacco

13
	published there some of the results of our work in
	13
	dependence?

14
	people who had - who were tobacco-dependent smokers
	14
	A.    We call them postdoctoral fellows. So

15
	who also had psychiatric co-morbid factors.
	15
	they all have had a doctoral degree, whether it be a

16
	Q.    And the last journal that I wanted to ask
	16
	Ph.D. or an M.D.; and then we, basically, mentor them

17
	you about is something called Cancer Investigation.
	17
	on how to do research, and then they can develop their

18
	A.    Yes.
	18
	own research career after being mentored for two or

19
	Q.    Okay. What's that?
	19
	sometimes three years, with not just me, but with our

21
	on ï¿½
	21
	Q.    And I'm looking here. I counted up

22
	There are several cancer journals,
	22
	eight ï¿½ eight people that you, I guess, oversee in

23

11
	was an internist from New Jersey. And he and I worked
	11
	Q.    Okay. And what exactly is it that you

12
	with the American Society of Addiction Medicine, so ï¿½
	12
	do?

13
	A new award was named after him, after he
	13
	You said yesterday that you're going to

14

	14
	Hong Kong and you've done some work in Hong Kong, but ;j

15
	works in tobacco dependence.
	15
	what exactly is it that you do out there?

16
	Q.    And you received that, from looking here,
	16
	A.    Well, in Hong Kong, we have a

17
	in 2014.
	17
	relationship ï¿½ not just me, but the Nicotine

1                      So it's been about a five- or six-year

2         relationship, and we've trained hundreds of people in

3         Hong Kong that go out and work in their own locale.

4         But we've done that in other places, too.

5                Q.    Why is it important for you to not just

6         share your expertise nationally, in this country, but

7         also internationally?

8                      MR. COFER: Objection, Your Honor;

9                relevance.

10                      THE COURT: Sustained.

11                Q.    Have you shared your expertise on

12         nicotine addiction, both nationally and

13         internationally?

14                      MR. COFER: Objection, asked and

15                answered.

16                      THE COURT: Sustained.

17                Q.    Some folks might have heard of this.

18         Have you received research grants?

19                A.    I have.

2 0               Q.    What is a grant? What do you get?

21               A.    Well, a grant is similar to the

2 2        peer-review process. For things like NIH, you put in

2 3        a grant, then it's reviewed by your peers at a study

2 4        section, and then they critique it and give a score.

2 5        And the better score gets the grant.

Page   1713

1                       If you don't do well, and get a poor

2         score, then you can resubmit it at another time to see

3         if you can improve it based on the critique.

4                 Q.    And over the last 25 years, what

5         percentage of the grants that you've received have

6         dealt with nicotine addiction, tobacco dependence,

7         tobacco companies?

8                A.    Almost all of them.

9                Q.    After you get a grant approved, do you

10         get money?

11                 A.    True. I don't get money; the institution

12         gets money.

13                 Q.    Is it money that goes to you, or does it

14         go to the institution to do the research?

15                A.    It goes to the institution to pay my

16         salary, which doesn't change if I get a grant.

17                 Q.    Gotcha.

18                       Have you received grants from the

19         National Cancer Institute? 2 0               A.    Yes.

21               Q.    And can you tell us some of the other

2 2        places you've received grants from?

2 3               A.    Well, other branches of NIH. TheNIDA.

2 4               Q.    What is NIH?

2 5               A.    National Institutes of Health. And the

Electronically signed by Susan Sternberg (401-307-089-1638)

Page   1714

1         National Institute of Drug Abuse is one of the

2         institutes that deals with addictions, in general, but

3         also does a lot of tobacco work, as does the Cancer

4         Institute. And then the National Institute of Alcohol

5         Abuse and Alcoholism, NIAAA, I've gotten grants from.

6               Q.    And have the grants that you've received

7         contributed to the publication of actual research?

8               A.    They have. That's the whole purpose, is

9         to do the work and do the research and then

10         disseminate the findings of the work, whether they be

11         positive or negative.

12                Q.    Gotcha.

13                     Have you also written book chapters or

14         books on the subject of nicotine addiction and tobacco

15         dependence?

16                A.    Book chapters, mainly.

17                Q.    Okay. Book chapters.

18                      So how does that work? How does a

19         physician or a researcher participate in authoring a 2 0        book chapter?

21              A.    Well, it's similar to the peer-review

2 2        process, but you're asked by the editors or the

2 3        organization to contribute to a book chapter or write

2 4        a book chapter.

2 5                   So the American Society of Addiction

Page   1715

1         Medicine is the one that we've done most recently, and

2         I've done several of ï¿½ in their ï¿½ in their book

3         called Nicotine Addiction.

4                      So we write the part about

5         pharmacotherapy, how to treat this from a medical

6         standpoint, using medications.

7                Q.    And have -

8                      The book chapters that you've submitted,

9         what general subject have they dealt with over the

10         last 25, 30 years?

11                A.    Almost all tobacco. There have been some

12         to do with alcohol, earlier in my career.

13                Q.    Got it.

14                      Is one of the books that you've published

15         in regarding tobacco and nicotine addiction, a book

16         titled "Principles of Addiction Medicine"?

17                A.    That's the one I just mentioned, the

18         American Society of Addiction Medicine.

19                Q.    Okay. Have you also gone to other places

2 0        outside of, you know, Hong Kong, to present and talk

21        and teach about nicotine addiction and tobacco

2 2        dependence?

23              A.    Yes.

2 4              Q.    Have you gone to places like Australia?

25              A.    Yes.

	12
	Your Honor, so I would object on those grounds.

13
	A.    Well, we have a communications group at

14
	Mayo Clinic that puts out press releases when we have

	MR. COFER: Well, frankly, I think he's

25
	Q.    What is that organization?
	25
	done a great job laying a foundation that this

1
	A.    Well, that's -
	1
	guy is extraordinarily qualified in nicotine

2
	It's what it says it is. It's the
	2
	addiction. I think it's time to move on.

3
	Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco. It's
	3
	I objected on the policy of ASAM because

4
	more research oriented, where ASAM, the American
	4
	it's not relevant. The issue is his

5
	Society of Addiction Medicine, is more clinical and
	5
	credibility, not whether some other

6
	does less research and supports less research.
	6
	organization says other witnesses shouldn't

7
	So SRNT is really the main research
	7
	testify for tobacco companies.

8
	organization for nicotine and tobacco. It's an
	8
	THE COURT: Okay. I understand. The

9
	international group.
	9
	objection's overruled.

10
	Q.    Do you know if the American Society of
	10
	(The sidebar discussion was concluded and

11
	Addiction Medicine, the ASAM group, has a policy
	11
	the following was held in open court:)

12
	against its members working for tobacco companies or
	12
	THE COURT: All right. The last

13
	testifying for tobacco companies?
	13
	objection's overruled.

14
	MR. COFER: Objection, relevance.
	14
	You may continue, Mr. Gdanski.

15
	THE COURT: Overruled.
	15
	MR. GDANSKI: Thank you. Please the

16
	You can answer.

	Court.

17
	A.    They do.
	17
	BY MR. GDANSKI:

18
	Q.    Okay. So if you're a member of the
	18
	Q.    Dr. Hurt, my question was: What is the

19
	American Society of Addiction Medicine, that group, is
	19
	policy of the ASAM, American Society of Addiction   ji

20
	there sort of an overarching policy within the group,
	20
	Medicine, as it relates to the people who belong to

21
	that says, don't work for the industry?
	21
	that organization testifying and working for the

22
	MR. COFER: Objection; leading, asked and
	22
	tobacco industry?

23
	answered.
	23
	A.    Initially, it was to be discouraged, but

24
	THE COURT: Sustained.
	24
	then it became more official policy that memberships  ij

25
	Q.    What is the policy of the American
	25
	should not do that.

1                 Q.    Okay. From 1995 to 1998, were you on the

2          American Medical Association Adolescent Smoking

3          Cessation Advisory Board?

4                 A.    Yes.

5                 Q.    And what was that?

6                 A.    Well, it was a group just to do exactly

7          what it says, to try to figure out how to help

8          adolescent smokers to stop smoking and to prevent them

9          from starting. And, so, a lot of it came about

10          because of our nicotine patch work we had done with

11          adolescents.

12                 Q.    So why is it important, Dr. Hurt, to

13          become involved in the prevention of young people,

14          children, adolescents, taking up smoking and trying to

15          help them to stop smoking?

16                 A.    Well, first of all, there's very little

17          known about helping them to stop smoking, so that's

18          one of the things that we did, to try to help figure

19          that out, using more conventional treatments; and we 2 0         found, more recently, that behavioral treatment works,

21         counseling works, but the pharmacotherapy doesn't work

2 2         as well as it does in adults.

2 3                     But then the other part is to really make

2 4         it clear to everyone that the adolescent brain isn't

2 5         fully developed until they get to be into their lower

Page   1721

1          20s. High teens, lower 20s. And so the last thing to

2          develop is the frontal part of the brain, which is

3          where judgment is.

4                         So when teen smokers begin to smoke at

5          age 13 or 14 or 15, they don't have all of the

6          equipment in the central nervous system to decide

7          those things. So it's important for pediatricians to

8          understand that, it's important for adolescent

9          medicine people to understand. And it's really

10          important for parents and other people to understand

11          their vulnerability.

12                  Q.    Is nicotine addiction, tobacco

13          dependence, is it an underdiagnosed disease in this

14          country?

15                  A.    It is.

16                  Q.    Okay. What have been the practical

17          ramifications, the effect of the fact that it is

18          underdiagnosed? What does that even mean, to be

19          underdiagnosed?

2 0                A.    Well, if you go through medical records

21         and ï¿½ and try to figure out if the physician or the

2 2         healthcare professional has made the diagnosis when

2 3         it's pretty obvious that it should have been made,

2 4         that's what "underdiagnosis" would mean. 2 5                Q.    And so what's the practical effect and

Electronically signed by Susan Sternberg (401-307-089-1638)

Page   1722

1          the impact of nicotine addiction being an

2          underdiagnosed disease in this country?

3                 A.    Well, being underdiagnosed means it's not

4          recognized for the serious medical problem that it is.

5          So if you go through the medical records ï¿½

6                        I mean, we see this all the time, even in

7          our place, where a person has a tobacco-caused cancer,

8          but the diagnosis of tobacco dependence isn't on the

9          diagnostic list, and they oftentimes aren't even sent

10          to the dependence center for consult.

11                        So the recognition of this from a

12          diagnostic standpoint is important because it raises

13          the level of awareness of the seriousness of the

14          problem. Left untreated, tobacco dependence kills

15          over 60 percent of the smokers.

16                  Q.    Okay. Have you also done work with

17          government agencies?

18                  A.    I have.

19                  Q.    All right. And tell us just what the 2 0         "FDA" stands for, that acronym.

21                A.    The FDA is the Food and Dmg

2 2         Administration of the United States government.

23                Q.    And have you done work with that

2 4         organization?

25                A.    I have.

Page   1723

1                  Q.    Tell the jury about that, please.

2                  A.    Well, it was -

3                         In 1994, they had a meeting to decide if

4          nicotine was an addicting drug, at the same time that

5          they were considering approval for a new

6          nicotine-delivery device called the nicotine nasal

7          spray. So I testified at the FDA for that.

8                  Q.    Okay. And have you given testimony

9          before the United States Senate or state legislatures

10          on any of the issues related to abuse of tobacco,

11          nicotine addiction, prevention of underage smoking,

12          child smoking?

13                  A.    I have.

14                  Q.    Have you done that nationally, I guess,

15          from a federal legislative perspective and also on a

16          state and local perspective?

17                  A.    Yes.

18                  Q.    And why do you do that? Why is that

19          important to you?

2 0                A.    Well, it's, again, important to raise the

21         level of awareness of the seriousness of the problem.

2 2         And these requests come to be better informed by the

2 3         people that are asking for this. It has to do with

2 4         those things, but also to do with secondhand smoke,

2 5         which is another important topic.

	we really got to know more about, yes.
	6
	Counsel, sidebar, please.

7
	Q.    Okay. So -
	7
	(The following discussion was held at

8
	What are you referring to? Explain to
	8
	sidebar:)

9
	the jury ï¿½
	9
	MR. COFER: I object to the term "secret

10
	You said, as part of a Minnesota tobacco
	10
	documents." They were private, confidential,

11
	trial. How did you get involved in this Minnesota
	11
	internal business records. It's argumentative,

12
	trial?
	12
	pejorative, and it's unnecessary.

	MR. COFER: Objection, Your Honor;
	13
	MR. GDANSKI: I'll use the term

14
	relevance.
	14
	"private." That doesn't make a difference, but

15
	THE COURT: Sustained.
	15
	it is ï¿½ there's ï¿½

16
	Q.    Have you reviewed the company documents,
	16
	It's going to be very hard for him to

17
	so ï¿½
	17
	describe his qualifications on this subject

18
	You understand what I mean when I say
	18
	without articulating the genesis of it. In

19
	"company documents"?
	19
	other words, this is not ï¿½

20
	A.    Yes.
	20
	THE COURT: We're not going to talk about    \

21
	Q.    Okay. And when I say "company
	21
	the Minnesota case in this case.

22
	documents," what am I referring to? What do you
	22
	MR. GDANSKI: I have no interest in

23
	understand that to be?
	23
	getting into the nature of the claims of the

24
	A.    Documents that have now been made public,
	24
	case, or anything; but the fact of the matter

25
	that were not public before 1998.
	25
	is that the state contacted him to be a witness

	Page   1727     \

1
	Q.    And they came from the tobacco industry?

	and, as part of that, asked him to review

2
	A.    They did.
	2
	documents.

3
	Q.    They were previously secret?
	3
	THE COURT: And you can -

4
	A.    Correct.
	4
	MR. COFER: He said that.

5
	Q.    Have you reviewed many, many, many
	5
	THE COURT: He already said that. He

6
	millions of pages of those documents from this
	6
	said he was involved in another case.

7
	industry?
	7
	MR. GDANSKI: I think there was an

8
	A.    I have.
	8
	objection, it was all stricken and sustained.

9
	Q.    And without getting into the background
	9
	MR. COFER: They've heard all that.

10
	of the Minnesota litigation and how that ï¿½ you know,
	10
	THE COURT: Yeah, but you don't need to

11
	what it was about ï¿½
	11
	get into the nature of the claims, all that

12
	MR. WEAVER: Objection, Your Honor.
	12
	stuff

13
	THE COURT: Sustained.
	13
	MR. GDANSKI: I'll tell him-

14
	Q.    Can you just tell us how you came about
	14
	Without getting into the nature of the ï¿½

15
	to be the person to review these documents?
	15
	THE COURT: And then you're going to use

16
	A.    Well, I was contacted by the State of
	16
	the word "confidential" or "company documents."

17
	Minnesota to be an expert witness, based on ï¿½
	17
	MR. WEAVER: There's repeated reference

18
	MR. WEAVER: Objection, Your Honor.
	18
	to litigation.

19
	THE COURT: Sustained. Let's -
	19
	THE COURT: We're not going to use

20
	We'll just talk about the documents,
	20
	"litigation."

21
	Mr. Gdanski.
	21
	MR. GDANSKI: Some documents do say

22
	MR. GDANSKI: Okay.
	22
	"secret," but I'll just show him and -

23
	Q.    It's ï¿½ they're very ï¿½
	23
	THE COURT: Just show him. All right.

	Q.    Okay. And approximately how many
	16
	A.    Yes.

17
	documents were released back in 1998, that you had the
	17
	Q.    This is one of those cases. Is this your

20
	A.    The total is about 33 million pages.
	20
	A.    No. This is the third.

	Q.    How on earth did you do that?
	21

	Q.    Is a cigarette that we buy in a store

8
	explanation. So when I first started doing this, I
	8
	from these companies, is that the same as a cigarette

	12
	Q.    And how big of a difference is there

13
	Q.    Can you give the ï¿½ can you give the jury
	13
	between the two, a manufactured cigarette from these

14
	just -
	14
	companies, versus a cigarette that you just roll from

15
	Is there a difference between how much
	15
	tobacco in the store? What's the level of difference?

16
	you charge now that you've retired, versus how you
	16
	A.    Well, it's light years difference. Like

17
	charged folks who retained your services to come and
	17
	I mentioned yesterday, the cigarette is the most

18
	explain these issues to a jury when you were employed
	18
	sophisticated drug-delivery device that's ever been

19
	by Mayo?
	19
	created.

20
	A.    It's the same charge.
	20
	Q.    And who has complete control over the

21
	Q.    Okay. But how does the process of
	21
	manufacturing process of what goes into cigarettes and   ji

22
	getting paid differ?
	22
	what comes out?

23
	A.    Back then, I got the time from the

	fees don't go to the clinic anymore?
	1
	manufacturer, control the cigarette-manufacturing

2
	A.    No.
	2
	process?

3
	Q.    So where do they go now?
	3
	A.    They do.

4
	A.    They go to me.
	4
	Q.    Okay. And to what level of precision do

5
	Q.    Okay. And how much do you charge us?
	5
	they control it?

6
	A.    $700 an hour.
	6
	A.    To -

7
	Q.    All right. And how many hours have you
	7
	Basically, not only milligrams, but even

8
	spent looking at materials in this case?
	8
	submilligrams, as far as nicotine is concerned. So

9
	A.    Oh, I haven't added them up. I've got
	9
	they have it precisely defined how much nicotine is in I

10
	kind of a mnning tab, but I haven't added it all up.
	10
	the cigarette and how much nicotine is delivered to ï¿½

11
	Q.    Fair enough. Whatever it is, you're
	11
	in the smoke.

12
	going to charge us the rate; right?
	12
	Q.    You mentioned it a few times ï¿½ we're

13
	A.    Yes, that's correct. It's probably ï¿½
	13
	going to talk about it specifically ï¿½ but what is

14
	preparation for this, probably 16, 18 hours.
	14
	this thing you're calling pH manipulation?

15
	Q.    Okay. Were the company documents, the
	15
	A.    Well, pH is whether or not a solution is

16
	private company documents that you reviewed from the
	16
	acid or base. And so pH is the way of measuring it.

17
	industry, important to you as a nicotine researcher?
	17
	The pH of water is seven, and that's

18
	A.    Absolutely.
	18
	neutral. A pH of two is acid, like your stomach acid.

19
	Q.    Okay. And tell the jury why. Why were
	19
	And a pH of seven ï¿½ around eight, nine or ten would

20
	the company files important to you as a physician?
	20
	be a base, like toilet cleaner.

21
	A.    Well, it showed us what they knew, when
	21
	So when you move the pH by adding things

22
	they knew it, and what they did about it as regards to
	22
	to it, to increase it, you increase the fraction of

23
	nicotine addiction, and how far back in time it went.
	23
	nicotine that is in the free form. And it's only the

24
	But probably the most startling thing was
	24
	free form of nicotine that crosses biological

25
	the manipulation of nicotine by various methods,
	25
	membranes.

8
	Q.    Cigarette smokers in the United States,
	8
	THE COURT: Yes. Dr. Hurt -

9
	88 percent of adult smokers begin before the age of
	9
	Ladies and gentlemen, disregard the last

10
	18. So what's the significance of that?
	10
	comment; and Mr. Gdanski is going to reask the

11
	A.    Well, it has to do -
	11
	question.

12
	As I mentioned earlier, the brain
	12
	MR. GDANSKI: Okay.

13
	development of people doesn't really get completed
	13
	Q.    What percentage of the people who start

14
	until they're in their early 20s; and so the most
	14
	smoking before the age of 18 ultimately become

15
	vulnerable people to start smoking are teenagers. And
	15
	addicted?

16
	most people actually not only begin before the age of
	16
	A.    The vast majority.

17
	18, but the majority of those begin before the age of
	17
	Q.    Okay. And what percentage of people who

18
	16.
	18
	become addicted ultimately develop tobacco-related

19
	Q.    Has youth smoking rates - have they gone
	19
	diseases like lung cancer, COPD?

20
	down over the years?
	20
	A.    Over 60 percent die from it, not just

21
	A.    Well, they have, but they kind of go up
	21
	develop it.

22
	and down, and it really is -
	22
	Q.    "Die from it," you said?

23
	They're down this last year or two, but
	23
	A.    Over 60 percent of people who continue to

24
	they have periodically gone back up.
	24
	smoke into their adulthood die of tobacco-caused

25
	Q.    So since, let's say, 1964, '65, since the
	25
	diseases, including lung cancer and COPD.


	Page   1741
	
	Page   17 43     \

1
	mid-'60s, has there been a consistent decrease in
	1
	Q.    And it says here, 44 percent of adult

2
	youth smoking in this country?
	2
	smokers try to stop each year, but less than

3
	A.    It was, until the last decade or so, when
	3
	five percent achieve long-term smoking abstinence.

4
	it had the slight increase for a year or two; and then
	4
	How does that relate to the work that

5
	it's gone back down. But it doesn't go down very
	5
	you've done at the Tobacco ï¿½ in Mayo Clinic at the

6
	dramatically.
	6
	dependence center?

7
	Q.    Each day, more than 3800, 3,800 teens,
	7
	A.    Well, what we know is that that number ï¿½

8
	have their first cigarette, and more than 1,000 become
	8
	it can be 48 percent ï¿½ of adult smokers trying to

9
	daily smokers.
	9
	stop smoking each year, most of them try to stop

10
	Do you see that?
	10
	smoking on their own. And, with that, less than

11
	A.    Yes.
	11
	five percent are able to achieve long-term abstinence.  1

12
	Q.    Okay. And what percentage of those folks
	12
	With good treatment, which we can

13
	go on, ultimately, statistically, to become addicted
	13
	provide, we can increase that substantially, so they

14
	and develop tobacco-related diseases?
	14
	have longer ï¿½ larger long-term smoking abstinence

15
	A.    Well, what we know about this is that
	15
	rates.

16
	daily smokers, when they become a daily smoker, that
	16
	Q.    When you say most people are able to ï¿½

17
	actually ï¿½
	17
	most people stop smoking on their own, is that cold

18
	Daily smokers, when they become daily
	18
	turkey?

19
	smokers, then they can become addicted fairly quickly.
	19
	A.    That would be cold turkey or using

20
	And that's something that most teen smokers don't
	20
	over-the-counter preparations.

21
	really realize. If you ask a teen smoker, do you plan
	21
	Q.    Have you done clinical trials on smoking

22
	to be a smoker when you're 18 or 19, they say, gosh,
	22
	cessation aids and smoking cessation drugs?

23
	no, I'm just going to smoke for a while with my
	23
	A.    Yes.

24
	friends and I won't be a smoker when I'm 18 or so.
	24
	Q.    Okay. What's a clinical trial?

25
	But the data from several studies show
	25
	A.    A clinical trial is usually a randomized,

	14
	carcinogenic and some are not. There are different

15
	A.    Yes, it is.
	15
	types of chemicals that are found. And the latest

16
	Q.    Is it now prescription or over the
	16
	number from one of the reports from the Surgeon

17
	counter?
	17
	General is over 7,000 chemicals, over 60 known

18
	A.    It's now over the counter. It came out

	carcinogens.

19
	in 1991.

5
	nicotine through a patch or a lozenge or a gum?
	5
	carcinogens are in cigarette smoke and how many

6
	A.    We have not done that, no.

	chemicals, is that still being studied to this very

7
	Q.    Okay. Have you seen studies on that
	7
	day?

	issue?
	8
	A.    Yes. As I just mentioned, two more were

9
	A.    Yes.
	9
	just added as carcinogens this year.

10
	Q.    Gotcha.

	Q.    Now, when you say that there's 7,000

11
	Let's go to Number 27, please.
	11
	chemicals, are those different than the carcinogens?

12
	So what is a cigarette? You know, we see
	12
	A.    They are. There are chemicals that can

13
	cigarettes, but what are they? What is a cigarette?
	13
	be what we call ciliotoxins, that can affect the

14
	A.    Well, a cigarette, by definition, is
	14
	little hairlike projections on the lungs, and they can

	16
	Q.    Do they cause other diseases, though?

17
	tobacco is not just crumpled up tobacco leaves from a
	17
	A.    Well, they cause other malfunctions. One

18

	Q.    What's cilia? What does that mean?

23
	Q.    Okay. And who has the power and control

1                 speculation, lack of foundation.

2                       THE COURT: Sustained.

3                 Q.    We'll show the documents in a little bit.

4                       "High doses of arterial nicotine," what

5         does that term mean?

6                A.    Well, the nicotine goes into the lungs

7         where it's rapidly absorbed and goes to the left side

8         of the heart, and goes out of the main artery into the

9         heart, which is called the aorta. That's what

10          "arterial" means.

11                       So you can measure nicotine in the

12         arteries going to the neck. It produces very high

13         concentrations going straight to the brain.

14                 Q.    And you say that high doses of arterial

15         nicotine ï¿½ the arrow means increases or leads to? ï¿½

16                A.    Leads to.

17                 Q.    ï¿½ okay ï¿½ leads to upregulation of the

18         nicotinic ï¿½ you got "acetylcholine receptors," right?

19                A.    That's correct.

2 0               Q.    Okay. What does all that mean?

21               A.    Well, all of us have acetylcholine

2 2        receptors in our brains and other parts of the body.

2 3        And acetylcholine is a natural neurotransmitter that,

2 4        when it activates these receptors, it does various

2 5        things, but one of the things it does is causes a

Page   1753

1         release of dopamine, which is a pleasure mediator.

2                      So if you're doing something pleasurable,

3         acetylcholine is released, dopamine is then released,

4         and then you have a pleasurable response. Watching a

5         funny movie, eating a piece of chocolate, having sex

6         would all be in that category.

7                     Nicotine looks enough like acetylcholine

8         to be able to stimulate the same receptors; and so

9         with these high spikes of nicotine that occur from

10         cigarette smoking, these receptors increase in number.

11                      That's what upregulation is called.

12         There are physically more of them in the brain of

13         smokers compared to nonsmokers. So if they don't give

14         them the spike of nicotine that they want, then

15         withdrawal symptoms occur. If they do give them the

16         spike of nicotine that they want, then pleasure ï¿½

17                      Some people smoke to avoid the

18         withdrawal, some people smoke for the pleasure. Most

19         people smoke for both. But it's all mediated through 2 0        the brain. This is a brain condition.

21              Q.    You say it's a brain condition. Have you

2 2        seen nicotine addiction described as a pediatric brain

2 3        condition?

2 4              A.    It has been, yes.

25              Q.    Okay. Is it one?

Electronically signed by Susan Sternberg (401-307-089-1638)

Page   1754

1                A.    It is. It begins in the pediatric age

2         group for most ï¿½ most smokers.

3                Q.    And here it says "genetic factors

4         influence tobacco dependence." What does that mean,

5         and how does genetic factors influence the brain?

6                A.    Well, the brain has ï¿½

7                      The genetics of this are that the

8         dopamine receptors in the brain can be affected

9         differently, and they can be different from one person

10         to the next.

11                      So people who sometimes experiment with

12         smoking when they're 13 or 14, nothing happens, they

13         don't have the dopamine release and they never become

14         smokers. So there are genetic things that determine a

15         person's response to this drug.

16                Q.    So have you seen in your studies some

17         people who, they do start smoking, 17, 18, 19, 20, 16,

18         15 years old, and for some reason it just doesn't

19         catch on and they don't become addicted? 2 0              A.    That's correct.

21              Q.    Okay. And is that what you're describing

2 2        here, is just people are made up a little bit

2 3        differently?

2 4              A.    That's correct.

2 5              Q.    Left untreated, more than 60 percent of

Page   1755

1         smokers die from a tobacco-caused disease. You talked

2         about that already.

3                A.    Yes.

4                Q.    Is nicotine ï¿½ or nicotine ï¿½

5                      What is a receptor? I mean, we'll talk a

6         little bit about it, but you mentioned the terms

7         "nicotine," "acetylcholine receptor."

8                      What's a "receptor"?

9                A.    Well, a "receptor," the way we think

10         about it is it's like a lock and a key. So the lock

11         is the receptor and the key is the neurotransmitter

12         that opens the lock.

13                      So receptors are in the brain and other

14         parts of the body, and when they're stimulated by the

15         key going into the lock, then they release other

16         neurotransmitters, and there are a variety of those.

17                      So "neuroreceptor" is just something

18         that's there waiting to be stimulated by a

19         neurotransmitter, and then wherever it is in the brain 2 0        or other parts of the body, then it does what it's

21         going to do.

22                Q.    And we have here ï¿½ it says, "upregulated 2 3        by high arterial doses of nicotine," and "nicotine

2 4        resets sensitivity of brain reward systems to

2 5        increased levels." Right?

1                A.    That's correct.

2                Q.    What does that mean?

3                A.    Well, the whole part about addiction is

4         having the drug to do something that has a reinforcing

5         effect. In other words, the reward systems in the

6         brain receive the drug, and then there's a reward,

7         like the pleasure from dopamine release.

8                      And what this says, and from the study

9         that we quoted here, the sensitivity of these reward

10         systems gets reset and ï¿½ because of these high, high

11         levels of nicotine that are coming to the brain.

12                Q.    Looking atï¿½

13                      Let me see if this helps you. Yours

14         doesn't ï¿½

15                A.    Mine doesn't seem to want to go there.

16                Q.    It could just be that you're hitting the

17         angle ï¿½

18                      There you go.

19                A.    I don't see it.

2 0               Q.    Okay. It's working. Just the angle that

21         you're at is a bad angle, so I'll help you out.

22                A.    All right.

2 3               Q.    Number 3, indelible memory of its effect

2 4        on reward systems.

2 5                    My question to you is: If a smoker

Page   1757

1         smokes and the nicotine gets up to their brain, does

2         it cause permanent brain changes?

3               A.    Well, it does. And so -

4                     First of all, it causes upregulation of

5         the nicotinic receptors, so there are physically more

6         of them. But what this means is that it's left with

7         memory. And that ï¿½

8                     At the very top, in yellow, it says,

9         "Unique in Biology." Most receptors, when they are

10         stimulated, are downregulated, there are fewer

11         receptors and very few are left with a memory of what

12         that was.

13                     So, from a clinical standpoint, we know

14         that a person who stops smoking for a month or two or

15         three, the receptors will downregulate, but they don't

16         forget what that stimulation was all about.

17                      So when they're in a situation where they

18         usually would have smoked, like having alcoholic

19         beverages, having a cup of coffee, driving a car, 2 0        talking on the telephone, then that provokes the

21        memory of what the reward was that they had when they

2 2        smoked cigarettes. And we call that a craving or an

2 3        urge to smoke. And that can occur months or even

2 4        years after a person has stopped smoking. 2 5              Q.    Have you seen in your practice people who

1         have said they continue to have cravings for nicotine

2         over a year after they stopped smoking?

3                      MR. COFER: Objection, leading.

4                      THE COURT: Sustained.

5                Q.    What's been your experience with folks

6         coming to you at the Mayo Clinic, complaining or

7         talking about cravings even after they've stopped?

8                A.    Well, it's highly variable, but it can ï¿½

9         it can happen months after a person stops smoking or

10         even years after a person stops smoking, depending

11         upon what the external cue or the external trigger is.

12                Q.    And then it says: The indelible memory

13         evoked by external views causes cravings.

14                A.    That's correct.

15                Q.    What does that mean? You just said that.

16                A.    I just said that.

17                       So the downregulation occurs, so you end

18         up with the same number of receptors that you started

19         out with, but they have memory to what that was all 2 0        about.

21                    And this study actually was a study of

2 2        cocaine-addicted rats compared to nicotine-addicted

2 3        rats. And the memory was higher in the

2 4        nicotine-addicted rats than it was in the

25        cocaine-addicted rats.

Page   1759

1                Q.    How do you study something like that?

2                A.    Well, we didn't, but the authors that

3         studied this have a ï¿½ a system where they have a

4         catheter in the vein in the back of the rat, which is

5         hooked to a feeding lever, so they can press the lever

6         to get the dmg.

7                      And so they became addicted, and then

8         they took the dmg away, and then they re-exposed them

9         to the dmg, let them press the lever. And so the

10         previously-addicted nicotine rats begin to press the

11         lever faster over a shorter period of time than the

12         cocaine rats did. So they concluded that the memory

13         was even stronger in nicotine rats than it was in

14         cocaine rats. And we see that clinically a lot.

15                Q.    All right. Have you studiedï¿½

16                      I asked you about this, but the

17         engineering of a cigarette, have you looked at that?

18                A.    Yes.

19                Q.    Let's take a look at PDR229, please.

2 0                    Can you please walk the jury through some

21        of the features, some of the manners and methods by

2 2        which the tobacco industry controls and engineers a

2 3        cigarette?

2 4              A.    Well, this is just a partial list. If

2 5        you start up at the top right ï¿½

1
	Go to the flavorings on the top right.
	1
	A.    They are. Most of them are, yes.

2
	Okay, yeah.
	2
	Q.    And are there certain types of, you know,

3
	So many different flavors are added to
	3
	tobacco that have more cancer-causing agents and some  ji

4
	cigarettes in order to tone down the harshness of the
	4
	types that have less in them?

5
	nicotine. Nicotine, when you taste pure nicotine, is
	5
	A.    There are. And so the American blend is

6
	pretty, pretty repugnant. In fact, one document
	6
	a blend of Burley, flue-cured, and Oriental tobacco,

7
	describes it as ï¿½ as tasting like burning rubber. So
	7
	and the top two have more of those.

8
	they have to do something to kind of disguise that,
	8
	Q.    And is the blend that the companies, the

9
	and so adding flavorants like licorice and cocoa and
	9
	defendants here at trial, use, a blend that causes

10
	other things to the mixture.
	10
	more cancer than other blends?

11
	Then, in the blended tobacco, the next
	11
	A.    Well, I'm not sure.

12
	one, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, these are some of
	12
	Q.    Or has more carcinogens?

13
	the cancer-causing substances in tobacco. And
	13
	A.    I'm not sure it's ever been compared

14
	different countries do it differently. And in the
	14
	quite that way.

15
	United States, the blend has a fairly large number of
	15
	Q.    All right. Fair enough.

16
	these nitrosamines.
	16
	So now you were on ammonia compounds.

17
	Q.    Let me stop you for one second and ask
	17
	A.    Correct.

18
	you some questions about those two, okay?
	18
	Q.    Tell us about that, please.

19
	A.    Okay.
	19
	A.    Well, ammonia has the ability to raise

20
	Q.    So the flavorings ï¿½
	20
	the pH of the smoke and the tobacco. And if you raise

21
	It says here "licorice." Does the
	21
	the pH, you have more free nicotine. And it's only

22
	tobacco industry voluntarily put licorice in
	22
	the free nicotine that crosses biological membranes.

23
	cigarettes?
	23
	So ammonia compounds are used in the

24
	A.    They do.
	24
	manufacturing process, primarily in the reconstituted

25
	Q.    And in what quantity? Is it just a
	25
	tobacco, which is another part of the blend that is


	Page   1761
	
	Page   17 63     \

1
	little bit? In the gross amounts.
	1
	completely controlled by the companies. So ammonia is

2
	A.    Well, I think they're one of the largest
	2
	a major part.

3
	users of licorice in the country.
	3
	In fact, there's one estimate that, for

4
	Q.    Now, is there any cigarette that tastes
	4
	every cigarette manufactured, there's around

5
	like licorice?
	5
	10 milligrams of ammonia or ammonia-related compounds ;j

6
	A.    No.
	6
	per cigarette.

7
	Q.    So what's it doing there?
	7
	Q.    Is ammonia a natural component in

8
	A.    It's toning down the harshness of the
	8
	cigarettes?

9
	cigarette; of the nicotine, mainly.
	9
	A.    It is.

10
	Q.    And chocolate, cocoa, does the industry
	10
	Q.    But do they also, after ï¿½

11
	voluntarily choose to put cocoa in, chocolate, in
	11
	During the manufacturing process, does

12
	cigarettes?
	12
	the manufacturer put additional ammonia into the

13
	MR. COFER: Object to the form.
	13
	cigarettes?

14
	THE COURT: Sustained.
	14
	MR. COFER: Objection; leading, asked and

15
	Q.    Do these companies put chocolate and
	15
	answered.

16
	cocoa in cigarettes?
	16
	THE COURT: Sustained.

17
	A.    Yes.
	17
	Q.    Is the ammonia ï¿½ Sorry.

18
	Q.    Do they have to do that?
	18
	Is the ammonia that's found naturally in

19
	A.    It will vary from company to company to
	19
	cigarettes, the same amount that's found in cigarettes

20
	company.
	20
	you buy at a store sold by these companies?

21
	Q.    All right. My question was: Do they
	21
	A.    No. Menthol -

22
	have to do that?
	22
	Q.    One second. You mentioned reconstituted

23
	A.    No, they don't have to. No.
	23
	tobacco, I think. So tell the jury what that is.

24
	Q.    Now, these tobacco-specific nitrosamines,
	24
	What is that concept, "reconstituted tobacco"?

25
	are those chemicals, are those cancer-causing agents?
	25
	A.    Well, I don't know how to explain this.

	So the tobacco leaf has ï¿½ it's kind of

	A.    Sugars reduce the pH and, therefore, make

5
	up ï¿½
	5
	it so it's less harsh, but then when ï¿½ when they are

6
	So the meaty part of the tobacco is the
	6
	burned, incinerated, then acetaldehyde, which is an

7
	part that's the richest in everything, including
	7
	aldehyde, itself, it's a chemical, the chemical

8
	nicotine. The stems used to be thrown away, you know,

9
	back in ï¿½

	the addictive nature of this on the receptors.

10
	I think back in even the 1950s, they

	Q.    A lot of people have heard of menthol.

11
	discovered that if they used the stems and other
	11
	What is it?

12
	leftover products from the tobacco plant, it looks
	12
	A.    Menthol is a chemical that is used in a

13
	like tobacco, it smells like tobacco, doesn't have as
	13
	lot of different things; and, for cigarettes, it's

14
	much nicotine in it, but has some, then they could
	14
	used to make them more palatable.

15
	take those residual parts that are not part of the

	Q.    You know that Nick Perrotto smoked, for

16
	meaty part of the tobacco and make paper of them.
	16
	many years, menthol cigarettes?

17
	So they put them in a big slurry, and
	17
	A.    He did.

18
	then they add other things to the slurry. Just like
	18
	Q.    Is menthol in the amount that it occurs

19
	you make a sheet of paper, it's a liquid, and then you
	19
	in mentholated cigarettes, is that ï¿½ is that natural

20
	dry it. And it looks like tobacco, smells like
	20
	to the cigarette?

21
	tobacco, and it's all chopped up and it's put into the
	21
	A.    No.

22
	cigarette. That's what reconstituted tobacco is.
	22

	Q.    And during the manufacture of a cigarette
	23

24
	using a reconstituted tobacco, does the manufacturer

	2
	Q.    Why?

3

4
	nicotine from the reconstituted tobacco, do they put

	6
	menthol has in cigarettes?

7

	A.    Well, people who are menthol smokers are

	A.    Sure.
	8
	generally more addicted and have a much harder time ij

9
	Q.    Okay. Levulinic acid, what is that?
	9
	stopping; and children who start smoking menthol

10
	A.    Well, what we know about this is that if
	10
	cigarettes become addicted faster.

11
	you lower the pH, the ï¿½ of the nicotine, of the
	11
	So menthol makes it more palatable, makes

12
	tobacco, then ï¿½ then it makes it so it's less harsh.
	12
	it easier to inhale, because it has a soothing,

13
	And so levulinic acid can do that, it reduces the

	harshness.
	22
	some degree of menthol in them, yes.

	9
	of any dmg helps determine its addictive potential.

10
	A.    Well, cigarettes used to be rated on
	10
	Crack cocaine is more addicting than

11
	their delivery of tar and nicotine, and so one of the
	11
	snorting cocaine. Same chemical, same dmg, but crack jj

12

	4
	"Entrained" just means it gets kind of

	into the system through the particle, but also the

	free ï¿½ freebase form, which is the gas phase.

8
	What would happen to things like lung
	8
	Q.    What does that mean, "freebase"?

9
	cancer and emphysema if the industry only sold
	9
	A.    Well, it has to do with the pH. So the

	cigarettes that did not cause or sustain addiction in
	10
	amount of free nicotine ï¿½

11
	smokers like Nick Perrotto?
	11
	And it's only the free nicotine that

12
	MR. COFER: Same objection and -
	12
	crosses biological membranes. That's tme if you put

13
	THE COURT: Same ruling, and I -
	13
	nicotine gum in your mouth or if you're inhaling

14
	Yes, you may proceed, Mr. Gdanski.
	14
	tobacco smoke. If you do something to lower the pH,

	15
	make it more acidic, then you bind the nicotine.

16
	diseases if the industry sold cigarettes that did not
	16
	So when we say "freebase," it means it's

17
	cause addiction?
	17
	free to cross the biological membranes, because it is

18
	A.    The diseases would go down dramatically.
	18
	in a base solution. More alkaline. That's where the

19
	Q.    Distilled from burning tobacco ï¿½
	19
	term "freebase" came from, from the tobacco

20
	Why would they go down? I should ask you

	22
	You tell me if I'm saying this right or

23
	A.    Because people wouldn't smoke them.
	23
	wrong: If nicotine is absorbed in such a way that

24
	Like I said yesterday, no one's ever
	24
	it's freebased, does that impact the addictive

	12

	nicotine levels in the morning are going down, and so

	20
	the receptors, then, if there are a large number of

21
	A.    No.
	21
	them, they want a cigarette right immediately, so the

22
	Q.    And in the documents we're going to look
	22

23
	at, have you studied the historical design and efforts

	24
	Q.    Okay. And what are the two ï¿½ the two

3
	Q.    Half-life of 120-
	3
	A.    Well, those are two. There are others,

4
	You talked about inhalation, peak
	4
	but the two that are ï¿½ that we teach in the medical

5
	arterial concentration, and venous concentrations.

	school and to residents and to busy physicians, if you

6
	You talked about that?

	had only two questions to ask about a person's tobacco

	A.    Yes.

	use, time to first cigarette is one, and how much do

8
	Q.    Half-life, 120 minutes, what's that mean?
	8
	you smoke is the other. So those are what we call The

9
	A.    Well, that's very important, because the
	9
	Heaviness of Smoking Index.

10
	half-life of any drug helps determine how often you
	10
	Q.    Is that a test that you're familiar with,

11
	have to administer it. And so this is a relatively
	11
	called The Heaviness of Smoking Index?

12
	short half-life. It's two hours.
	12
	A.    Yes.

13
	What that means is, if you were to take a
	13
	Q.    And is that a reliable, reproducible test

14
	dose of nicotine, in any way, like nicotine gum or
	14
	that you used over the course of your career with your

15
	nicotine patches, and we measure the nicotine in your
	15
	patients at Mayo, to say, I'm going to ask you these

16
	system, and it was 20, then we took the patch off and
	16
	two questions, now I'm going to make a determination

17
	didn't give any more patches or more cigarettes, then,
	17
	if you are or are not addicted?

18
	two hours later, it would go from 20 to ten; two hours
	18
	MR. COFER: Objection, leading.

19
	after that, it would be five; two hours after that, it
	19
	THE COURT: Sustained.

20
	would be two and a half; and two hours after that, it
	20
	Q.    Do you have an opinion as to the

21
	would be one point ï¿½ whatever the division is.
	21
	reliability and the utility of what you call The

22
	So five half-lives is what it takes to
	22
	Heaviness of Smoking Index?

23
	clear a drug from the system if you don't keep on
	23
	A.    Yes. It's reliable and it's predictive.

24
	administering it.
	24
	It's predictive ï¿½ the higher the level is predictive

	your training, experience, education, as to whether or
	1
	Q.    Have you prepared a slide dealing with

2
	not Mr. Perrotto was addicted to nicotine in
	2
	plasma concentrations in smoking, after smoking?

3
	cigarettes?
	3
	A.    Yes.

4
	A.    He was.
	4
	Q.    All right. Let's put that up, Number 6,

5
	Q.    Okay. And why was he?
	5
	and tell us what we're looking at, because it is some

6
	A.    Because his time to first cigarette was
	6
	real science-looking stuff

7
	basically when he awakened. He kept his cigarettes on
	7
	A.    Well, this ï¿½ on the left-hand panel ï¿½

8
	the bedstand next to his bed. He smoked, various
	8
	So the left-hand panel shows the arterial

9
	estimates, up to three packs of cigarettes a day for
	9
	concentrations from nicotine from smoking a cigarette.

10
	most of his smoking career, and then went on to smoke
	10
	Now, that shows a vertical spike, but each puff would

11
	even more when he changed to ultralight cigarettes in
	11
	give its own little spike as it went up, but these are

12
	the latter part of his life.
	12
	just measurements that are made.

13
	So a person smoking more than two packs a
	13
	Q.    And "arterial" means what?

14
	day, having their first cigarette within five minutes
	14
	A.    If you put a needle in the neck of a

15
	of rising, would be highly dependent on this scale.
	15
	person and pull out blood from the artery in the neck

16
	Q.    And in reaching the conclusion that
	16
	while they're smoking a cigarette ï¿½ you can do it

17
	Nicholas Perrotto was addicted to nicotine in
	17
	from the arm, too ï¿½ but that would give you an

18
	cigarettes, did you use the exact same criteria that
	18
	arterial level, as opposed to taking it out of the

19
	you would use for patients who come to the Tobacco
	19
	veins, out of the ï¿½ where blood is normally drawn for

20
	Dependence Center at Mayo?
	20
	laboratory testing. That would be down below. That's

21
	A.    Well, no. We use these two criteria all
	21
	the venous concentration, which is much less than the

22
	the time. They're part of what is called the
	22
	arterial concentration. So it's just ï¿½

23
	Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, and they're
	23
	This arterial spike is what people smoke

24
	the two questions that give it most ï¿½ most of its
	24
	for. It's called the impact, or the hit, the kick.

25
	validity. But there are other questions that we could

	There are various euphemisms for it. But, basically,

	reward system to kick in.
	2
	Q.    Let's take a look at Number 9, please.

3
	Q.    And what do we see on the right-hand
	3
	And we'll break after this.

4
	side?
	4
	All right. So--

5
	A.    On the right-hand side, I've already
	5
	A.    Okay. So-

6
	mentioned, that's ï¿½ this is crack cocaine. And so
	6
	Q.    What is this?

7
	crack cocaine, when you inhale it, does the same
	7
	A.    These are PET-MRI scans. And on the top   I

8
	thing. It's inhaled into the lungs, very rapidly
	8
	are the controls, and on the bottom are the different

9
	absorbed, and goes straight to the brain. So that's
	9
	smoking conditions.

10
	why crack cocaine is more addictive than snorting
	10
	So all the ones on the top are no smoking

11
	cocaine, because it gets into the system faster.
	11
	at all. Then, on the bottom ï¿½

12
	Q.    And let's take a look at Number 7,
	12
	The first one on the left on the bottom

13
	please.
	13
	is no smoking, the next one is one puff, the next one   I

14
	So is this what you were just describing,
	14
	is three puffs, the next one is one whole cigarette,

15
	just anatomically looking?
	15
	and the next one is three whole cigarettes. And the

16
	A.    Correct. So this is from some of our
	16
	blueness means that there's saturation of these

17
	patient material. So ï¿½
	17
	nicotinic receptors that are in the brain.

18
	I can't see ï¿½ I'm not doing as well ï¿½
	18
	So three cigarettes ï¿½ three cigarettes,

19
	Q.    Ifyou use your left hand, you'll
	19
	basically, will saturate the entire system. And

20
	probably have a better chance.
	20
	that's why people smoke, is to have the receptors be

21
	A.    Well, the cigarette's in the mouth, and
	21
	activated. And this is part of the addictive process.

22
	so what it's showing is the smoke going into the
	22
	Q.    And, I don't know, is this a human brain

23
	lungs, into the yellow arrows on the right side. It's
	23
	or an animal brain?

24
	rapidly absorbed.
	24
	A.    This is a human brain.

25
	And then it goes to the left side of the
	25
	Q.    Human brain scans. Do ï¿½


	Page   1789
	
	Page   17 91     \

1
	heart and it's pumped out of the aorta. And when it
	1
	A.    It's hard to get animals to smoke.

2
	goes to ï¿½ out of the aorta, the first two arteries
	2
	Q.    That's tme. Good point.

3
	that come off of the aorta are the coronary arteries,
	3
	Do the people that you come across at the

4
	and the second two arteries are the carotid arteries,
	4
	Mayo Clinic, the patients, regular people,

5
	the ones that take it to the brain. So it's a super
	5
	non-scientists, do they understand that the nicotine

6
	highway to the brain, and that's why we portray it as
	6
	is just causing these rapid changes in their brain?

7
	a ï¿½ basically, a hit of nicotine in the brain
	7
	MR. COFER: Objection; leading,

8
	substance.
	8
	argumentative.

9
	Q.    Now, have there actually been ï¿½
	9
	THE COURT: Sustained.

10
	What's an MRI?
	10
	Q.    Based on your work with patients, how do

11
	A.    MRI is an imaging study called magnetic
	11
	they understand the real biomechanical, biomolecular I

12
	resonance imaging. It's just a different ï¿½ it's kind
	12
	changes that are taking place when they smoke

13
	of like a CT scan, but it's done differently.
	13
	cigarettes?

14
	Q.    Have there been CT scan studies or MRI
	14
	A.    They're clueless. And so that's an

15
	studies of the brains after they're exposed to
	15
	important part of our teaching now. That's why

16
	nicotine, to see what they look like, you know,
	16
	they're different than a person who can stop without

17
	internally what's taking place?
	17
	any difficulty, because their brains have been

18
	A.    Correct.
	18
	changed.

19
	Q.    Have you looked at those type ï¿½ that
	19
	So we explain the neurobiology of this to

20
	type of information, to study the real effect nicotine
	20
	the patients as a way to greatly relieve their ï¿½ a

21
	has on the brain?
	21
	lot of their emotions, because they have guilt. They

22
	A.    Yes. And we show this to patients and ï¿½
	22
	feel guilty because they're still smoking and their

23
	as well as students and residents.
	23
	loved one stopped smoking. And to have them

24
	Q.    Why do you show this to patients?
	24
	understand that there is a biological basis for this

25
	A.    So that they understand why it's so hard
	25
	is part of the treatment process.

	they just say, thank you for explaining this to me,

14
	gentlemen, let me give you a morning ï¿½ I
	14
	So you don't have to be there, you can

15
	always give everybody a morning stretch break.
	15
	just go ahead and do it outside -

16
	Let me go ahead and give you a ten-minute

	JUROR KUNKEL: It's on a blackboard.

17
	stretch break and then we'll continue with

	23
	think about it?

24
	Mr. Kunkel, I understand there's some
	24

25
	lecturing scheduling issues.

	whether ï¿½

1
	JUROR KUNKEL: Yeah. Actually, as I
	1
	Is he asking to be excused?

2
	mentioned in voir dire, I'm a professor, I
	2
	THE COURT: I guess -

3
	teach cardiopulmonary and pharmacology, and I
	3
	Well, no, he's not. He just wants to

4
	have two lectures coming up in the next two
	4
	know if he can do ï¿½ he wants to see if he can

5
	weeks regarding cardiopulmonary conditions; and
	5
	update his lecture.

6
	it's a medical pathology course which deals
	6
	MR. COFER: Yeah, but he can't do any

7
	with the dysfunction that occurs in the
	7
	research.

8
	cardiopulmonary system, and part is relative to
	8
	THE COURT: I know. And that's why-

9
	smoking.
	9
	And I thought that was very nice of

10
	THE COURT: Okay.
	10
	him ï¿½

11
	JUROR KUNKEL: So I deal with
	11
	MR. GDANSKI: It is very nice.

12
	pharmacologic aspects, and I explain that to
	12
	THE COURT: ï¿½ to make sure he followed   1

13
	the students.
	13
	the instructions and ï¿½

14
	Since I won't be there, the way that I
	14
	MR. COFER: Oh, absolutely.

15
	would have to deliver it would be in an audio
	15
	THE COURT: -let us know.

16
	recording with the PowerPoint, and then I would
	16
	MR. GDANSKI: It is.

17
	upload that to the blackboard; but it usually
	17
	He should bring the students in to listen

18
	involves some form of research and reading to
	18
	to this.

19
	develop the PowerPoint, as well, which would be
	19
	THE COURT: A field trip, right?

20
	conditions such as COPD, emphysema,
	20
	MR. COFER: So, to me, the issue is

21
	cardiopulmonary disease, et cetera.
	21
	either he doesn't get to do that or we release

22
	THE COURT: So you're saying that you
	22
	him.

23
	would have to do additional research to prepare
	23

	He's obviously very forthcoming and is a

3
	Part of the instructions are he's not

4
	allowed to do any research on any issues
	4
	in this courthouse that have not been so

	but you just ï¿½ you just never know. You're
	9
	THE COURT: He seems conscientious, yes.   ij

10
	taking a risk. That's my only concern.
	10
	MR. COFER: And just another issue. He's

11
	MR. COFER: My point is, he's the second
	11
	asked some questions like, would lives be saved

12
	alternate and we've only got a week to go,
	12
	if they made less addictive cigarettes. I've

13
	basically. And so there's no reason to think
	13
	objected to those on speculation, foundation.

14
	that you're not going to have ï¿½
	14
	Til also make Williams and State Farm

15
	We're never going to get to him unless ï¿½
	15
	objections.

16
	THE COURT: I have never ï¿½ we've done ï¿½
	16
	I mean, his public health view, I

17
	This is number three. We've never got to
	17
	understand it, it has really nothing to do with

18
	alternate one in one of these cases, so it's up
	18
	Phase I, Mr. Perrotto. I understand we briefed

19
	to you, but ï¿½
	19
	that. But, you know, I mean, the bottom line

20
	MR. COFER: I've got to alternate one
	20
	is ï¿½

21
	once, I've never got to alternate two, and
	21
	Well, I said enough.

22
	rather ï¿½ if it's interfering with his
	22
	THE COURT: Okay. That's fine. So those    ;

23
	professional activities, I would let him go.
	23
	are preserved for the record.

	11
	Q.    Dr. Hurt, we were just looking at and

12
	I'll tell them that. I'll give them the
	12
	explaining to the jury some of the different views and

13
	lectures from last year, and I'll say, you can
	13
	how the brain is actually affected on a

1         this is just one example of several studies that have

2         been done to show this.

3                      So they apply a stain to the cells, that

4         is picked up by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,

5         the receptors we've been talking about.

6                      So, on the top is normal. So all of us

7         that are not smokers would have kind of a gray

8         appearance to these stains. On the bottom shows

9         billions more of these cells, these receptors, in a

10         smoker compared to the nonsmoker.

11                      This is what we mean by upregulation.

12         There are physically more receptors in the addicted

13         smoker compared to the nonsmoker.

14                Q.    And based on what you know about Nick

15         Perrotto's smoking, was his brain impacted by the

16         nicotine in cigarettes?

17                A.    There's no question about that. I mean,

18         he had classic withdrawal symptoms, he had all kinds

19         of other things that went on.

2 0                    He tried to stop smoking multiple

21        different times; and in order for him to have done

2 2        that, it would have required some pretty intensive

2 3        treatment, I think, and ï¿½ because his brain probably

2 4        looked like the one on the lower panel.

2 5               Q.    Okay. Have you seen some smokers who

Page   1805

1         come to the Mayo Clinic and they come to the clinic

2         and they say, listen, Dr. Hurt, I'm not addicted, you

3         know, I enjoy smoking? Has that happened?

4               A.    Well, infrequently. Most of the time, we

5         have patients who are being referred by a physician.

6         They say that, but when you ï¿½ when you peel away the

7         layers of the onion ï¿½

8                     As I mentioned earlier, some people smoke

9         for the reward, the release of dopamine ï¿½

10                     MR. WEAVER: Objection, Your Honor;

11                narrative.

12                     THE COURT: Sustained.

13                Q.    When you talk to the smokers about their

14         perception of why they're smoking, what have you, as a

15         physician, learned?

16               A.    Well, some people smoke for the reward,

17         and some people smoke to avoid withdrawal. Most

18         people smoke for both reasons, and they sometimes have

19         trouble keeping one separate from the other because 2 0        they're so intertwined.

21              Q.    Now, what is the significance when it

2 2        comes to nicotine addiction of the person starting to

2 3        smoke as a youth, as a kid, like Mr. Perrotto?

2 4              A.    Well, as I mentioned, I think, earlier,

2 5        the brain development is really key in this. And so

Electronically signed by Susan Sternberg (401-307-089-1638)

Page   1806

1         the brain develops from the back to the front, and the

2         front part of the brain is where judgment lies.

3                      And so a teenager is missing that part of

4         the brain function, and so that's part of the ï¿½ the

5         neurobiology of this. They're very vulnerable because

6         their brain has not been fully developed.

7                Q.    And we have a slide here: Dynamic

8         sequence of gray matter maturation over the cortical

9         surface.

10                A.    "Cortical" means the outside.

11                Q.    Okay. So what are we -

12                      Tell the jury what we see here on the ï¿½

13         I guess the chart.

14                A.    So this is from the National Institute of

15         Drug Abuse. And it shows, on the left side, five -

16                      The line in the middle shows their age.

17         So five -

18                      The middle here, you've got 13; 20 is on

19         the right-hand side. And the blue is the cortical 2 0        surface, this ï¿½ this ï¿½ the gray matter that's being

21        laid down on the outside of the brain. And it doesn't

2 2        completely do that until a person is in their 20s or

2 3        even a little bit later.

2 4                    So when it's all blue, that means the

2 5        brain is fully developed. When there's less blue,

Page   1807

1         it's -

2                      So it begins maturation at the back and

3         goes to the front, and the front is ï¿½ is the

4         important part.

5                Q.    And so let's go to Number 12. Why, in

6         this case, Debbie Perrotto's case, talking about Nick

7         Perrotto's smoking, why is this brain development

8         important?

9                A.    Well, when ï¿½ when a person is age 13,

10         like Mr. Perrotto was when he started smoking, he

11         would not have had complete brain development.

12                       So this slide shows the same scale, but

13         shows what's developed. In the back part of the brain

14         is the cerebellum. That's where the more primitive

15         things are, coordination.

16                      Then it moves toward the midbrain, the

17         nucleus accumbens, and that's where motivation is.

18                      And then the next phase to develop is in

19         the amygdala, which is kind of in the middle part of 2 0        the brain. That's where emotion lies.

21                      And then judgment is the last thing to

22         develop, and that's in the front part of the brain. 2 3                    So, at age 13, his brain was not fully

2 4        developed.

25               Q.    And do you have an opinion and

2
	Mr. Perrotto was able, as a child, 13, to make an

	A.    Correct.

3
	informed decision to start smoking?
	3
	Q.    And how is that measured? How do you

4
	A.    No.
	4
	measure, for purposes of this study, the receptors in

5
	Q.    Well, "do you have an opinion?" is the
	5
	three different groups, people who smoke menthol,

	versus people who smoke non-menthol, versus

7
	A.    Well, he - he -
	7
	nonsmokers?

8
	He started smoking, but he probably, like

	A.    Well, it goes back to the study where we

9
	most other teenagers, said what I said earlier: I'll

	from the same group at UCLA that did that study; and

	a smoker when I'm 20. But he got addicted.
	11
	this is just a quantification of the receptors rather

	chart.
	3
	this case, was Nick Perrotto always a menthol smoker?

4
	Q.    Okay. And how does that relate to his
	4

5
	ability to make a neurochemically or neurobiologically

	have not done this ï¿½

5
	A.    Salem, for sure, has always been a

	THE COURT: Put it in time context.

6
	menthol cigarette, and I think Newport has been, too;
	6
	Q.    Between 1950 and 1996, when Mr. Perrotto

7
	but there are other cigarettes, like Marlboro, which
	7
	died, did the industry ever come out and say the

8
	has a Marlboro Red brand and a Marlboro Menthol, so ï¿½
	8
	menthol in cigarettes increases youth initiation and

9
	Q.    Exactly. That's my question. Are
	9
	makes it harder for people to stop smoking, increasing

10
	some ï¿½
	10
	addiction?

11
	When he switched, after, to the Merit
	11
	A.    They have not.

12
	cigarettes, which we're going to talk about, did you
	12
	Q.    I want to talk about something in

13
	see whether he smoked Merit Menthol or Merit regular?
	13
	Slide 51.

14
	A.    He smoked the menthols, but I'm not sure
	14
	So what does nicotine do?

15
	exactly the time frame.
	15
	I mean, we talked a tremendous amount

16
	Q.    Gotcha.
	16
	about nicotine and how it affects your brain and it

17
	And so what do we see here? What does
	17
	causes receptors, and we have a video we'll show, but

18
	the graph show as to the actual difference in the
	18
	how does that make the person feel, the smoker?

19
	brain chemistry in a menthol smoker, versus a regular
	19
	A.    Well, this slide shows the various

20
	smoker, versus a nonsmoker?
	20
	neurotransmitters that are affected by nicotine. And

21
	A.    Well, the brain slices like we had ï¿½
	21
	the top one I've already mentioned, dopamine, has to

22
	that had the stains on them, the menthol smoker would
	22
	do with pleasure.

23
	be even darker than the non-menthol smoker because
	23
	We've known for a long time that smokers,

24
	there are more receptors.
	24
	when they smoke, sometimes they smoke to stay awake.

25
	And, again, the receptors are used to
	25
	That's the stimulant effect from the release of what's


	Page   1813
	
	Page   1815     \

1
	getting a spike of nicotine; and if they don't get a
	1
	called norepinephrine. "Norepinephrine" is another

2
	spike of nicotine, then it produces withdrawal
	2
	word for adrenaline. And so that does do those two

3
	symptoms.
	3
	things. It keeps people awake, but it also suppresses

4
	So having more receptors is not a good
	4
	the appetite.

5
	thing. In fact, it probably is the reason that
	5
	So these are just some of the

6
	menthol cigarettes are more addicting and it's more
	6
	neurotransmitters. Growth hormones are affected, too.

7
	difficult for menthol smokers to stop smoking.
	7
	There are all kinds of different things that are

8
	Q.    Right now, is there a current public

	Q.    And if somebody was to report, you know,

11
	A.    There's no debate.
	11
	that, when they smoked, it made them feel a little

12
	Q.    What does the public health community
	12
	better or affected their appetite, or gave them

13
	have to say?
	13
	pleasure, helped their memory, helped them study,

14
	A.    It should be removed.
	14
	something like that, would that be a direct effect and

	impact from nicotine?

	10
	do you know that?

11
	50 million number, of people who stopped smoking, do
	11
	A.    Well, because if it were, then these data

12
	you know how that number was generated, how it came
	12
	would indicate that half of the smokers today would

13
	about?
	13
	stop smoking. And that would mean going from

14
	A.    Yeah, those are surveys. And what they

	43 million to 21-and-a-half million in one year; and

15
	do is, they do telephone surveys, asking about smoking

16
	behavior. And to qualify as a current smoker ï¿½

	had a hundred cigarettes in your lifetime. So that's

	Q.    Have you seen people in your practice who

	a smoker.
	20
	to quit smoking, and they fail?

21
	And if you're re-contacted later, then
	21
	A.    Absolutely. This is a chronic,

22
	you're asked if you're a current smoker. And if you

23
	say "no," then you're counted as an ex-smoker, which
	23

24
	is kind of a little bit strange, but that's ï¿½
	24
	Q.    And you're familiar with the 1988 Surgeon

	2
	Q.    And ï¿½ well, let me back up one second.

3
	smoker.
	3
	Why is the relapse rate so high? Why

4
	So those data are a little bit
	4
	does it got to be so hard?

5
	misleading, in that it includes a lot of people who
	5
	A.    Because of the brain changes that have

6
	may have smoked a hundred cigarettes when they were in
	6
	occurred. And, remember, the brain, though the

7
	their teen years, but never became ï¿½ never became a
	7
	receptors downregulate back to the same number that we

8
	regular smoker. So it's a little bit confusing.
	8
	started out with, they have memory to what this was

9
	Q.    Thank you for that.
	9
	about, so the external cues or the triggers to smoke

10
	Now, it says here, 68.8 percent, smokers
	10
	leads people to say, maybe I can just have one; and

11
	who want to quit, versus 52 percent who try to quit.
	11
	then they realize, after they've done that, they

12
	Can you explain the difference, please?
	12
	can't, because this kind of reactivates the entire

13
	A.    Well, if you asked a smoker ï¿½ a hundred
	13
	system.

14
	smokers, would you rather be a nonsmoker, upwards of
	14
	Q.    And earlier when I asked you about what

15
	70 percent ï¿½ in this particular study, 68 percent ï¿½
	15
	you showed the people who come to the Mayo Clinic, and ;j

16
	say that they would prefer to be a nonsmoker. And
	16
	you show them the brain studies and you talk to them

17
	then, in any given year, about half of people who are
	17
	about that, why, as a physician, is it important for

18
	smokers try to stop smoking most of the time on their
	18
	the smoker to understand exactly the truth of what's

19
	own.
	19
	going on and how addictive nicotine is?

20
	So if this were simply a matter of
	20
	A.    Well, as I mentioned earlier, it relieves

21
	choice, this would go away in about five years.
	21
	a lot of their guilt. They have been told that they

	Q.    And why would a smoker need to hear that?

17
	he was the co-chair of the group that I became the
	17
	A.    To understand why it's so hard for some

18
	board chair of.
	18
	people to stop smoking and not hard for other people

19
	Q.    What was that group?
	19
	to stop smoking.

20
	A.    It was called the Minnesota Partnership
	20
	Q.    So what were the major conclusions of the

21
	for Action Against Tobacco.
	21
	1988 Surgeon General's report?

22
	Q.    So what happened in 1988?
	22
	A.    Well, those are ï¿½

23
	Let's put up 48.
	23
	The three main conclusions are listed

24
	MR. GDANSKI: And we would move into
	24
	there: Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are

25
	evidence the 1988 report, PT03828.
	25
	addicting; nicotine is the dmg in tobacco that causes

	THE COURT: Any objection? 1988 report.
	1
	addiction; the pharmacologic and behavioral processes

2
	MR. COFER: It's the same objection that
	2
	that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those

3
	I made earlier.
	3
	that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and

4
	THE COURT: All right. Objection's
	4
	cocaine.

5
	preserved. Overmled.
	5
	Q.    Before this report was issued, had the

6
	MR. COFER: Thank you, Your Honor.
	6
	Surgeon General formally come out with the

7
	(Said exhibit was marked as Plaintiffs
	7
	pronouncement that cigarettes and other forms of

8
	Exhibit Number PT03828, and received in
	8
	tobacco are addicting?

9
	evidence by the Court.)
	9
	A.   Not to this level. There was one report

10
	BY MR. GDANSKI:
	10
	by Surgeon General Burney, who said that it looked

11
	Q.    Okay. So -
	11
	like nicotine in tobacco products was addicting, but

12
	A.    So the -
	12
	this is the whole ï¿½ this is the whole report on that

13
	Q.    Tell us -
	13
	subject.

14
	A.    The 1988 report was the first report from
	14
	Q.    And Bullet Point Number 3, the

15
	the Surgeon General that was entitled "Nicotine
	15
	pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine

16
	Addiction."
	16
	tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine

17
	So, as I mentioned yesterday, we
	17
	addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine, now,

18
	established our Nicotine Dependence Center and opened
	18
	how is that possible?

19
	it up in 1988, so we were kind of ahead of the game,
	19
	A.    Well, it's all a neurochemical or

20
	including the addiction part of treatment for smokers.
	20
	neurobiologieal phenomena, and so the receptors in the

21
	But this is the first report focused on nicotine
	21
	brain that have to do with ï¿½ with even marijuana or

22
	addiction.
	22
	cocaine or heroin are affected by this outside drug

23
	Q.    One of the things you said yesterday, I
	23
	and produce some of the same neurobiologieal phenomena ;j

24
	wanted to follow up with you on, was that you had
	24
	that nicotine does.

	that part.

	Q.    Okay. And is nicotine the drug in
	3
	But we do a technique called motivational

4
	tobacco that caused Nick Perrotto's addiction?
	4
	interviewing. And that means we are meeting the

5
	A.    It did.
	5
	patient where the patient is, rather than, basically,

6
	Q.    Ultimately, you know, I think from the
	6
	telling the patient what to do. So, having them

7
	records, did Mr. Perrotto stop smoking at some point
	7
	understand the process.

8
	in time?
	8
	Stopping smoking is a process. It

9
	A.    He did.
	9
	doesn't happen all at once. With most people, it

10
	Q.    Okay. When did he stop smoking?
	10
	takes several tries before a person is able to stop

11
	A.    Right after he had his radiation therapy;
	11
	smoking.

12
	right before he was getting ready to have his
	12
	Q.    Is quitting only about motivation?

13
	chemotherapy.
	13
	A.    No.

14
	Q.    And sometime before his surgery for lung
	14
	Q.    All right. Are there variabilities,

15
	cancer?
	15
	differences among some people's circumstance and their   j!

16
	A.    Correct.
	16
	addiction that affects their ability to quit?

17
	Q.    So does being addicted mean that the
	17
	A.    Absolutely.

18
	smoker cannot quit?
	18
	Q.    And how do you deal with that in your

19
	A.    No.
	19
	practice? How do you take that into account?

20
	Q.    And the flip side of that, does quitting
	20
	A.    Well, through this technique of

21
	smoking mean that you were never addicted?
	21
	motivational interviewing. We ask open-ended

22
	A.    That's correct.
	22
	questions, and we do scaling questions to see how

23
	Q.    Does it mean that?
	23
	confident they are that they may be able to stop

24
	A.    No.
	24
	smoking.

25
	Q.    Okay. So how is it that you can be
	25
	And so those are questions we ask that


	Page   1829
	
	Page   1831     \

1
	addicted and quit and you can quit and still be
	1
	really assess where the patient is. And then we try

2
	addicted? How does that whole ï¿½
	2
	to help move the patient through the process of

3
	How do you reconcile that?
	3
	stopping smoking. So there are many, many factors

4
	A.    Well, if s hard. It's -
	4
	that go into that.

5
	Part of it has to do with the
	5
	Q.    Okay. How does addiction ï¿½ how does

6
	circumstance. So, in Mr. Perrotto's case, he was
	6
	addiction to nicotine actually make it harder for the

7
	diagnosed with lung cancer, and he continued to smoke.
	7
	smoker to quit?

8
	So, for people in that condition, in that
	8
	A.    Well, it's a physical ï¿½ it's a physical

9
	situation where they have a major medical problem, we
	9
	and biological phenomenon. And so when the person \

10
	think that that is a very high-level criteria for ï¿½
	10
	loses control over a substance, whatever that

11
	for tobacco dependence or nicotine addiction. So it
	11
	substance is, that's kind of the tipping point to ï¿½

12
	depends on the circumstances.
	12
	from social use or casual use, or even regular use, to

13
	If you have a heart attack, though you
	13
	being an addicted person.

14
	may have been an addicted smoker, about half of the
	14
	So loss of control is kind of one of the

15
	people who have a heart attack will stop smoking; but
	15
	central factors. So that applies to all drugs of

16
	that means the other half don't. And so trying to
	16
	addiction, not just to tobacco and nicotine.

17
	predict who is in those categories ï¿½
	17
	Q.    And is there certain definitions of

18
	Sometimes a catastrophic medical event
	18
	"addiction" that you've used in the past and have used \

19
	will help people who are heavily addicted to stop
	19
	at the Mayo Clinic?

20
	smoking, but that obviously didn't help with
	20
	A.    Yes.

21
	Mr. Perrotto.
	21
	Q.    Let's take a look at Number 3, please.

22
	Q.    Is motivation definitely important when
	22
	So what is the NIDA, National Institute

23
	it comes to quitting?
	23
	on Drug Abuse, definition of "addiction"?

24
	A.    It is. And we try to work with the
	24
	A.    Well, it kind of is what we've been

25
	patient in order to achieve more of that. Part of

13

	Q.    And who came up with that?
	14
	questionnaire called the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine  jj

15

	A.    Well, the bottom line is ï¿½
	19
	has been used for a long time, but it requires, also,

	It kind of goes back to what's up in the

	3
	would be the two questions to ask of any smoker.

4
	A.    No. In fact, I think the Surgeon
	4
	Q.    And you mentioned earlier, when you were

5
	General's report from '88 said that clearly, that
	5
	talking about Mr. Perrotto, that Debbie testified that

6
	there is no consensus on the definition of "nicotine
	6
	he smoked more when he switched to the Merit

7
	dependence."

	A.    I do.

9
	that one way of viewing addiction to drugs is just if
	9
	Q.    Okay.

10
	you use that drug a lot? Is that one way of just sort
	10
	A.    He went from three packs a day to four

11
	of identifying folks who most likely will be addicted?
	11
	packs a day, or something like that.

12
	A.    Well, regular users would be the people
	12
	Q.    Why did Mr. Perrotto smoke more when he

13
	that would ï¿½ you can then categorize as far as their
	13
	went from Merits to Merit Ultralights?

14
	level of dependence, regardless of which drug it is.
	14
	A.    Well, the ultralights have more

15
	Q.    And are there other measures of
	15
	ventilation holes on the tipping paper of the

16
	dependence that different clinicians may use?
	16
	cigarette. And that means more air gets into the

17
	A.    Yes. There's one from the American
	17
	smoke stream and it dilutes the smoke. It makes them

18
	Psychiatric Association, which is the DSM criteria,
	18
	feel like there's not as much impact that could go on

19
	which is useful, but it's only useful if you can
	19
	the back of the throat.

20
	interview the patient. So you would have to ask
	20
	But the reality is, if you smoke

21
	questions about withdrawal symptoms and tolerance and
	21
	ultralight cigarettes, you smoke them differently.

22
	other things that are in those criteria.
	22
	You inhale deeper, you hold your breath longer, and

23
	And those criteria actually evolved from
	23
	some people just smoke more cigarettes because, again,   jj

24
	the alcoholism field, and they haven't been changed
	24
	they're smoking for the spike of nicotine in the

25
	very much in the last 30 years. So we don't use them

	that's where that part of the free choice could come

	10

	come out with another ï¿½ another report?

	product that has more air coming into the smoke

14
	smoking more, are ways of compensating for the design

4

	4
	A.    I can't recall specifically.

5
	A.    It is. And we explain that to them and
	5
	Q.    Okay. And let's put up Slide Number 4,

6

11
	that they've had by learning more about the way the

	I'll just use this. When it comes to
	1
	A.    Well, it starts on the left, where the

2
	looking at the two factors you need to meet in order
	2
	addiction takes place, and then a person continues to

3
	for smoking to not be entirely free choice, based on
	3
	smoke, cigarette smoking. Those PAH and NNK are

4
	your review of the evidence, did Mr. Perrotto
	4
	cancer carcinogens. And then there are also other

5
	establish and meet Number 1, the age of initiation?
	5
	things that occur.

6
	In other words, started smoking as a kid?
	6
	DNA adducts are also carcinogens we can

7
	A.    Correct.
	7
	measure in the blood of people. And then these

8
	Q.    Okay. And Number 2, that he was addicted
	8
	mutations occur at various sites in the tissue of the

9
	to nicotine?
	9
	lung, and that leads to lung cancer.

10
	A.    No question about that.
	10
	And so it may take ï¿½ it may take several

11
	Q.    How does nicotine addiction ï¿½
	11
	years before the ï¿½ from the time the initial cancer

12
	You know, how does nicotine addiction
	12
	cell develops and can ï¿½ now can be actually measured,

13
	cause lung cancer? Because I think you said earlier
	13
	as much as four years before something is obvious from  jj

14
	nicotine is not a carcinogen, right?
	14
	a ï¿½ on a CT scan or from a clinical standpoint.

15
	A.    That's correct.
	15
	So this is a train of events that occurs

16
	Q.    Okay. So if it's not a carcinogen, it's
	16
	that changes the DNA, mutates them into cancer cells;

17
	not a cancer-causing substance, how does nicotine
	17
	and then once they begin to form, then the cancer

18
	addiction end up causing lung cancer in somebody?
	18
	cells multiply and divide, multiply and divide, until

19
	A.    Well, they continue to use the product
	19
	it becomes clinically evident. That may take several

20
	because they're addicted to it. And the product
	20
	years.                                                                               ji

21
	contains nicotine, very precisely controlled, to
	21
	Q.    And I would like to just make you aware

22
	maintain the addiction. And if it weren't for the
	22
	of two little facts that the parties don't disagree on

23
	nicotine in the cigarettes, they wouldn't continue to
	23
	in this case. One is that Nick Perrotto had lung

24
	smoke them. So those two things are so intertwined,
	24
	cancer, okay?

25
	it's hard to separate them.

	A.    He did.

	So the train of events is, develop the
	1
	Q.    Yes. And you reviewed his medical

2
	addiction to nicotine, delivered by cigarettes, which
	2
	records. He did, right?

3
	also delivers 7,000 other chemicals, over 60 known
	3
	A.    He did.

4
	carcinogens, and because of the reinforcement of the
	4
	Q.    And, number two, the parties do not

5
	nicotine, a person continues to smoke over a lifetime
	5
	dispute that Mr. Perrotto's lung cancer was caused by  \

6
	and ends up developing diseases, one of which is lung

14
	whether or not Mr. Nicholas Perrotto's nicotine

	when he would wake up in the middle of the night to

16
	A.    It did.
	16
	take care of a kid or go to the restroom, whatever it

17
	Q.    Okay. And how did it do so?
	17
	was, he would smoke a cigarette?

18
	A.    It led him to continue to smoke large

19
	amounts of cigarettes over a very long period of time;
	19
	becoming a criteria that's moved up with The Heaviness ;j

	the patch ï¿½ for a second. When did the patch come

	John Perrotto, talked about his father, Nick, you

2
	out?
	2
	know, taking a self assessment at the age of 50, where \

3
	A.    It came out in December of 1991.
	3
	he assessed his health and he tried to quit smoking?

4
	Q.    Okay. And he tried chewing gum. When
	4
	Do you remember that?

5
	did the nicotine replacement gum come out?
	5
	A.    I remember that, yes.

6
	A.    It was in the early 1980s. I can't
	6
	Q.    And did you see that John described his

7
	remember the exact date. I think it was probably '82
	7
	father was really motivated at the age of 50 to try to

8
	or '83, somewhere in there. I think ï¿½ I can't
	8
	quit smoking?

9
	remember.
	9
	A.    Correct.

10
	Q.    It was after '82, more ï¿½ most likely?
	10
	Q.    Okay. What year did Nick Perrotto turn

11
	A.    Most likely, yes.
	11
	50 years old in?

12
	Q.    If he tried chewing the nicotine gum,
	12
	A.    I'll have to do the math. So he was born

13
	which I think is the testimony in the case, is that
	13
	in '39, so ï¿½

14
	your recollection?
	14
	Q.    '89?

15
	A.    Yeah, there's ï¿½
	15
	A.    1990.

16
	He would try chewing gum, period. He
	16
	Q.    '89, '90, right?

17          Mr. Perrotto's factors, is there any way that any ï¿½

18          you know, that this man was not addicted to nicotine

19          in cigarettes? 2 0                 A.    No.

21                 Q.    It says the nicotine patch on here. How

2 2         long, using the patch, does it take for nicotine to

2 3         get to the brain?

2 4                 A.    It's very slow. It takes ï¿½

2 5                       The time to peak concentration is like

Page   1853

1          four to six hours. So it takes a long time to get ï¿½

2                        And the peak concentration is not

3          anywhere near what it is with smoking a cigarette.

4                        So the peak concentration from a

5          single-dose nicotine patch would give you a nicotine

6          level of 17 ï¿½ 1-7 ï¿½ whereas, the higher arterial

7          spikes would be upwards of 60 or 80 or 90. So

8          they're ï¿½ they're ï¿½

9                        It's comparing apples with oranges.

10                  Q.    And how about nicotine gum? How long

11          does it take for nicotine gum, the nicotine in the

12          gum, to get to the brain?

13                 A.    It gets there a little bit faster just

14          because of the surface area in the mouth, but it's

15          still a matter of ï¿½

16                        Time to peak concentration would be 30

17          minutes to ï¿½ to an hour or so.

18                  Q.    Okay. But do you still sometimes

19          prescribe people the patch, or recommend that they use 2 0         the gum in an effort to quit smoking?

21                  A.    Most of the time now, we recommend to use

22          it in combination, using a long-acting medication like 2 3         the patch, along with the short-acting medication like

2 4         the gum, and sometimes more than one patch at a time. 25                Q.    Okay. And why do you do that?

1                 A.    Well, because the patch doesn't deliver

2          nearly as much nicotine as cigarettes do. So we're

3          trying to quiet down these receptors that are wanting

4          a higher dose of nicotine. So we use higher doses of

5          nicotine patch therapy in order to try to get up to as

6          high a level as we can in order to help them to stop

7          smoking.

8                 Q.    And there's something else that's left

9          off. We discussed it, but it's left off this list.

10          Do the medical records, the objective medical records

11          in the case, demonstrate that Nick Perrotto continued

12          to smoke even after he was diagnosed with lung cancer?

13                 A.    He did.

14                  Q.    And why is something like that important

15          when you're assessing whether or not a person's

16          addicted?

17                 A.    Well, that meets that high-level

18          criteria, continuing to use despite having a strong

19          medical reason not to use. 2 0                Q.    Why is that -

21                     Is that a hallmark of addiction?

2 2                A.    Well, for those of us in clinical

2 3         medicine, that's really one of the top-level criteria.

2 4                Q.    And what's the concept of rock bottom in

2 5         addiction, in cigarette smoking?

Page   1855

1                 A.    "Rock bottom"?

2                  Q.    Yeah. You know, that you can't smoke

3          anymore.

4                  A.    It really comes from the alcoholism

5          literature, more than from the ï¿½ the smoking

6          literature; but it has to do with the self-esteem and

7          the guilt that people feel because of this and ï¿½ and

8          so that's kind of the concept.

9                  Q.    Now, having established that Nick

10          Perrotto was addicted, why did he continue to smoke?

11                  A.    Why did he continue to smoke?

12                  Q.    Yes, sir.

13                  A.    Because he was addicted. I don't ï¿½ I

14          don't know of any other real reason.

15                  Q.    Did you see in the depositions that there

16          was discussion about, you know, him saying, it's not

17          going to happen to me?

18                  A.    Well, that was earlier, and that's part

19          of the rationalization that happens when people talk 2 0         about, is it possible for me to develop disease "X," 21         "Y," or "Z" related to my smoking, and the

2 2         rationalization and denial is part of the addictive

23         process.

2 4                Q.    So how does rationalization and denial, a

2 5         person saying it's not going to happen to me, how does

	that fit right into the addictive process?
	1
	attempt help assess whether they really want to quit?

2
	A.    It's part of the addictive process.
	2
	A.    No.

3
	Q.    How? How are those two the same?
	3
	Q.    Let's take a look at Slide 57, please.

4
	A.    It allows your brain to say to yourself,
	4
	So I would like you, Dr. Hurt, maybe

5
	well, this is not going to happen to me, it will
	5
	before we break ï¿½

6
	happen to someone else.
	6

	THE COURT: Whenever is a good time for

9
	were smokers, and we said exactly the same thing, that
	9
	you, Mr. Gdanski, just let me know.

10
	will never happen to us. I mean, it's just part of
	10
	MR. GDANSKI: Yes. Thank you.

11
	the addictive process.
	11
	Q.    ï¿½to walk the jury through what we're

12
	Q.    And do you have a scientific conclusion
	12
	looking at here and how it actually relates to Nick

13
	that you've reached, based on your experience, as to
	13
	Perrotto, based on what you learned from reading the   jj

14
	how those concepts, that it's not going to happen to
	14
	materials in this case.

15
	me, I don't think it happens to ï¿½ you know, it won't
	15
	A.    Well, on the left-hand side, it shows the

16
	happen to me, how that impacts the addicted smoker
	16
	public health messages out there, and that ï¿½ that

17
	like Nick Perrotto?
	17
	public health messages help to drive people to try to

18
	A.    Well, it does. And it allows for
	18
	stop smoking.

19
	continued smoking because it basically ï¿½
	19
	Q.    I'm going to tell you, we're going to

20
	The rationalization is you rationalize
	20
	have another witness come to talk about those, but

21
	away the potential consequences.
	21
	without getting into ï¿½ super detailed about them,

22
	Q.    Okay. One thing real quick. This idea
	22
	just describe how that impacts nicotine addiction,

23
	of the 24-hour quit attempts to be like the only
	23
	please.

24
	defining characteristic, you don't quit for 24 hours,
	24
	A.    Well, it helps people who try to stop ï¿½

25
	you're not addicted, you ever seen that published
	25
	What we know about this is if they


	Page   1857
	
	Page   1859     \

1
	anywhere?
	1
	attempt to stop smoking, they're much more likely to ji

2
	A.    Well, the serious quit attempt is now
	2
	stop.

3
	thought to be represented by being able to try to stop
	3
	On the right-hand side, though, it has

4
	for a 24-hour period of time. That's kind of where
	4
	what's coming from the addiction part. So denial is

5
	that comes from, but it's ï¿½ it's ï¿½ it's kind of a ï¿½
	5
	at the top of the list.

6
	not an arbitrary setting, but it's just one
	6
	And if there is any way to put in the

7
	definition. It's kind of like the smoker being
	7
	mind of the ï¿½ of the smoker that there's really some

8
	defined as a person who smoked a hundred cigarettes or
	8
	doubt about whether or not these products cause this   \

9
	more in their lifetime. So it's a definition.
	9
	or there's some kind of controversy, that feeds into

10
	Q.    If a person ï¿½
	10
	the addiction part of this.

11
	Let's just say a person, they smoke a lot
	11
	And that's ï¿½ that's part of what

12
	of cigarettes and they try to quit, but none of them
	12
	Mr. Perrotto said, he didn't think these things were

13
	make it to 24 hours. Does that mean they were never
	13
	going to hurt him, I think were the words that he

14
	addicted?
	14
	used, and so he doubted that very clearly ï¿½ and that

15
	A.    No.
	15
	just fades into ï¿½ that feeds into the addiction.

16
	Q.    Okay. Would that be, you know, proper
	16
	Q.    And based on your review, the denial

17
	utilization of science to make that assertion?
	17
	caused the doubt, and that was created by the

18
	A.    No.
	18
	controversy?

19
	Q.    Does the length of a quit attempt really
	19
	A.    Well, the controversy ï¿½

20
	make a difference when you're assessing whether or not
	20
	MR. COFER: Objection, calls for

21
	a person's addicted?

	Anyway, you can go ahead and explain the

12

	12
	Q.    And based on your review of the materials   j;

13
	A.    So if you can create doubt about the
	13
	in this case, do you have an opinion and scientific

14
	addictive nature or the health part of this, then you
	14
	conclusion as to whether or not the controversy, the   jj

15
	can create controversy; if you create controversy, you
	15
	information out there regarding the health effects of jj

16
	create more doubt. And that feeds into the addicted
	16
	smoking, and the fact that Mr. Perrotto thought that   jj

17
	mind, saying, well, it must not be as bad as everyone
	17
	the Merit Ultralights were not as harmful as regular   jj

18
	thought it was and so I'm denying that this is going
	18
	cigarettes, do you have an opinion as to whether all   j;

19
	to happen to me and they rationalize it away.
	19
	of that fed into Mr. Perrotto's doubt, caused him to

6
	Q.    And based on your review of the materials

	and what did you end up smoking. And when they say,

7
	in this case, reading Debbie Perrotto's deposition,
	7
	well, I ended up smoking an ultralight, you ask, well,

8
	how did that all intersect and how was it demonstrated
	8
	why did you do that; and they said, well, because it

9
	in Mr. Perrotto's life?
	9
	was better for me, it was less harmful. That's the

10

	understanding how smokers perceive different messages?   jj

	won't hurt me as much.
	14
	A.    Correct.

	Q.    All right. And is that important to

16
	A.    And so that was one of the things that I

	understanding smoking behavior?

17
	recall her testifying about. And that's ï¿½ that
	17
	A.    It is.

18
	became part of his rationalization and denial.
	18
	Q.    Why is it so critically important in this

19
	Q.    All right. Okay. And when you say
	19
	case when talking about messages that the jury will

20
	"ultralights," what brand of cigarette was it that he
	20
	learn came from the tobacco industry and how they

21
	smoked, the ultralights?
	21
	affected Nick Perrotto? Why is it so important?

22
	A.    Merit.
	22
	A.    Well, it's important because it feeds

23
	Q.    And that's made by Philip Morris?
	23
	into the denial, and the denial and rationalization

24
	A.    It is.
	24
	are key points about a person being able to continue

15

16
	of what would have taken place in the life of

17
	Mr. Perrotto if there was no denial, doubt and

	18
	

19
	A.    He would have had a much better chance of
	19
	

20
	stopping smoking.
	20
	

21
	Q.    And would he most likely, if he would

22
	have stopped smoking much earlier, have avoided
	22
	

23
	getting his lung cancer?
	23

	A.    If he would have stopped smoking a lot

11
	And ladies and gentlemen, we're on

	is addictive?

17
	any point in time during those intervening years,
	17
	A    It would, yes.

18
	did any of these companies ever come out and say,
	18
	Q    And would it have likely had an impact on

19
	"The nicotine in our product is addictive"?
	19
	the public health in this country if the industry

20
	A    No.
	20
	would have admitted either of these two things:

21
	Q    They don't admit nicotine is addictive; is
	21
	Nicotine is addictive, and people smoked for

22
	that right?
	22
	nicotine between '53 and '96?

23
	A    Right.
	23
	A    It would have had a large impact, yes.

	A    Yes.

2
	generated, were meant to remain private,

	4
	A    1 think that's the way it went, yes.

5
	A    Yes.
	5
	Q    And the date of it is what?

6
	Q    Okay. Were they meant, when they were
	6
	A    1959.

7
	authored, to be shared and seen in the light of day
	7
	Q    And it's titled "Psychological Research"?

8
	in front of juries like this?
	8
	A    Correct.

9
	A    No.
	9
	Q    Just to orient the jury and everybody

10
	Q    So do and did the tobacco companies have
	10
	else, you see some of these documents have Bates

11
	psychological research programs where they had
	11
	numbers on the bottom?

12
	people in the companies really looking into the
	12
	A    Yes.

13
	details of why smokers smoke?
	13
	Q    So what does that mean?

14
	A    They did.
	14
	A    That's a unique identifier for this page

15
	Q    All right. And did this company, did
	15
	of this document.

16
	Philip Morris, for example, know internally, 1959,
	16
	Q    Can you tell from looking at some of the

17
	in their product documents, people smoke for
	17
	Bates numbers what company the document would come

18
	nicotine and it is 100 percent addictive?
	18
	from?

19
	MR. COFER: Objection, leading.
	19
	A   Yeah, they have different numbers for the

20
	THE COURT: Sustained.
	20
	different companies. Any number in this sequence

21
	MR. GDANSKI: Let's take a look at
	21
	would be the numbers for Philip Morris.  I think

22
	PT02231. We will move that into evidence.
	22
	it's ten.

23
	THE COURT: Any objection?
	23
	Q    Gotcha. So they pose a question. What's

24
	MR. COFER: There's no foundation to move
	24
	the question that the document supposes to itself?

25
	it into evidence yet, but I'm not sure the

	THE COURT: Sustained.
	2
	A    First was physiological reasons.

3
	MR. COFER: 1 certainly don't object. 1

	Right?

8
	company document from 1959 titled "Psychological

10
	question: Why do people smoke?
	10
	Stimulation or relaxation?

11
	A    Yes.
	11
	A    Correct.

12
	Q    Okay.
	12
	Q    And then number three, what is the reason,

13
	MR. GDANSKI: And I would like to move
	13
	the third reason listed here by Philip Morris in

14
	that document into evidence.
	14
	1958 - I'm sorry, 1959 as the reason people smoke?

15
	THE COURT: In evidence.
	15
	MR. COFER: Object to the form.

8
	A    I think they all were doing that, yes.
	8
	A    Well, it's a chemical compound actually.

9
	Q    Okay. And do we have documentary
	9
	It's a carcinogen and polycyclic hydrocarbon. It's

10
	evidence, proof, from the internal private files of

	13
	of three not yet reported by other investigators."

14
	MR. GDANSKI: And we'd move into evidence
	14
	Do you see that?

15
	02141.  PT02141.
	15
	A    Yes.

16
	MR. WEAVER: May I just have a minute,
	16
	Q    Now, let's go to the second page, please.

17
	Your Honor?
	17
	The physiological. What does

	THE COURT: Certainly.
	18

	BY MR. GDANSKI:
	19
	A    Well, it has an effect on some bodily

20
	Q    While they're doing that, have you heard

	functions, so if it had an effect on blood pressure,

21
	of someone named Alan Rodgman?
	21
	that would be a physiological sort of response,

	Q    Who is he?
	23
	Q    Requirements of the smoker with respect to

	Q    Did the industry spend a lot of money
	1
	nicotine to the extracted tobacco.

2
	researching why people smoke?
	2
	Q    And so what does that mean?

3
	A    They did.
	3
	A    Well, in the process of making the tobacco

4
	Q    Billions of dollars?
	4
	for the cigarette - we talked about reconstituted

5
	A    Say it again.

	Q    Was it billions of dollars?
	6
	nicotine to the tobacco that had been processed in

7
	A    1 don't know what the exact number. It's
	7
	order to get the optimal amount of nicotine.

8
	a lot of money.
	8
	Q    And when they say "application of the

	9
	optimum amount of nicotine to the extracted

10
	expenditures on how much was spent on the research
	10
	tobacco," why, Dr. Hurt, was it important to make

	objections.
	18
	Q    From a neurobiological perspective, forget

	THE COURT: In evidence over objection.
	19
	about the document, why is it important to make

	MR. COFER: Objection, lack of foundation.

2
	of the nicotine could be so harsh that the person
	2
	THE COURT: Overruled.

3
	wouldn't smoke. So it's a titration basically to

	make sure they have enough but not too much.
	4
	now.

5
	Q   And what are those doses when it comes to

	BY MR. GDANSKI:

6
	nicotine in cigarettes?
	6
	Q    Anybody understand in the public health

7
	A    Well, it is around 1.3 delivered
	7
	community in the years Nick Perrotto was alive

8
	milligrams of nicotine per cigarette. It goes up to
	8
	nicotine and its importance in cigarette smoking in

9
	1.5 or 1.6, but the threshold dose is around 1.3.
	9
	the same way that these companies understood it?

10
	Q   And is there a dose of nicotine in
	10
	A    No. In fact, the first Surgeon General's

11
	cigarettes that even though the nicotine will be
	11
	report on nicotine addiction was not published until

12
	present in the actual cigarette, the dose of it
	12
	1988, so it was way late in the game.

13
	would be insufficient, not enough, to sustain the
	13
	Q    Let's take a look at PT01945.

14
	addiction in smoking?
	14
	One of the companies, I don't know, I

15
	A    That's correct. It depends on how it's
	15
	think it's Mr. Weaver's client right now, but one of

16
	delivered.
	16
	the companies the jury is going to see documents

	Company?

19
	A   Alan Rodgman, yes.
	19
	A    Correct.

20
	Q    Those are the R.J. Reynolds Bates numbers

	down at the bottom?
	21
	A    Yes.

22
	A    They are.
	22

15
	the industry than the public health community.
	15
	A    Correct.

	2
	A    Correct.

	6
	A    1 remember something about the President,

7
	A    Yes.
	7
	yes.

8
	Q    Did they share information?
	8
	Q    And what's the one from Mark Twain?

9
	A    They shared information, they shared

	"Quitting smoking is easy. I've done it a thousand

10

	10
	times"?

11
	between not only their scientists but their
	11
	A    Correct.

12

	13
	scientific understandings of nicotine addiction the

14
	Q   And did you see, when you reviewed the

15
	documents back in the late '90s, did you see
	15
	'60s?

16
	documents from all these different companies?
	16
	A    No. And, in fact, this document has other

17
	A    Yes.
	17
	things in it that say more things about nicotine

18
	Q    Okay. So this is from '62. "The Effects

23
	second. I'm sure you have seen, I'm sure you've
	23
	MR. GDANSKI: Yeah, we would object. He

24
	talked about the fact that in 1964 the Surgeon
	24
	can cross-examine the witness.

25
	General came out with a report, right? You
	25
	MR. COFER: Well, I want to make an

	Page   1900

1
	mentioned that earlier?
	1

	a foundation for my objection.

	report characterize smoking behavior? Addiction or
	4
	would object, there's no basis to voir dire

5
	a habit?
	5
	just because it's cross. If he thinks he's got

6
	A   They called it habituating or a habit.
	6
	a point to score, he can score it on cross.

7
	Q    Based on your many years working in public
	7
	THE COURT: Let's - let me ask you -

8
	health, would it have likely had an impact on the
	8
	MR. GDANSKI: What are we doing?

9
	Surgeon General's report if, in 1964, or in the
	9
	MR. COFER: Well, because he's going to

10
	years preceding the '64 report, Philip Morris shared
	10
	say - the impression he's left with the jury

11
	their research from 1959 where they said people
	11
	was that had we shared documents that would

12
	smoke for addiction?
	12
	have said it was addicting in '64, and I'm

13
	MR. COFER: Objection, calls for

6
	Q    Why were they doing that?
	6
	Has the industry ever, between 1953 and

7
	A   Well, if one company had a better sales

	MR. GDANSKI: Sure.

	16
	talking about the tobacco industry. Has the tobacco

17
	Q    Let's go down at the bottom.
	17
	industry ever publicly acknowledged between 1953 anc

	19
	that management requires?

21
	Q   What is that?
	21
	Q   And have you seen statements where the

22
	A    Well, in particular in Brown &
	22
	industry comes out and says, you know, we put

23
	Williamson's case, there was a tobacco variant
	23
	nicotine at the level the smokers require.

24
	called Y1 tobacco, which basically can be
	24
	That's what they say publicly, right?

25
	genetically engineered to have twice the nicotine as

	A   All three companies represented were doing

11
	talk about what's what. Okay?
	11
	the same thing.

12
	A    Okay.
	12
	Q    Okay. This vat, this huge vat, this huge

13
	MR. GDANSKI: I'll step back for a second.
	13
	tank, and the previous one of the diammonium

14
	Is the sound off?
	14
	phosphate, that's, you know, diammonium phosphate

15
	(At this time, a video was played.)
	15
	being electively added to the cigarette

16
	BY MR. GDANSKI:
	16
	manufacturing process, right?

17
	Q   What are we looking at here?
	17
	A    That's correct.

18
	A   Well, these are -- it's going too fast
	18
	Q    Okay. Let's keep going.

19
	that -- back up a little bit.
	19
	450. So that's a three-digit number.

20
	These are stems and other products of the
	20
	A    That's another additive. Now this is -

21
	tobacco -- it's not part of the leaf itself. And so
	21
	stop it there.

22
	they're mixed together. And then the next series
	22
	This is the sheet-making process. So

23
	shows --
	23
	those things that were - that you saw earlier in

24
	Q    It is mixed together and goes where?
	24
	the smaller pieces, then were put into a slurry with

25
	A   Well, it is eventually going to be
	25
	liquid, and then they roll out over rollers to dry


	Page   1910
	
	Page   1912

1
	reconstituted tobacco.
	1
	it.

2
	Q    Okay.
	2
	And so these are big sheets of paper,

3
	A    The next one shows the extraction of the
	3
	basically, thin paper, that looks like tobacco,

4
	liquid from these - the residue of the - the waste
	4
	smells like tobacco, but the nicotine has been

5
	products, if you will, of the tobacco. What's
	5
	extracted from it.

6
	dripping down is liquid containing nicotine as well
	6
	Q    Okay.

7
	as other things from the tobacco product.
	7
	A    Until the very end, which is advanced on

8
	These vats show additives that are added
	8
	the bottom -

9
	to the tobacco, the reconstitute process, you can
	9
	Q    One second, one second, one second.

10
	add things to it. So this is one.
	10
	Sorry, 1 have another question for you. If 1 don't

11
	And the next one is DAP, called diammonium
	11
	ask it now I'll forget it. Okay.

12
	phosphate, which is an additive that adjusts the pH
	12
	You say the nicotine has been extracted,

13
	of the tobacco.
	13
	right?

14
	Q    Is there any other consumer product that
	14
	A    Right.

15
	is smoked where the manufacturer adds diammonium
	15
	Q    So if we back up one second. One second.

16
	phosphate to it that you are aware of?
	16
	There you go.

17
	A    Not that I'm aware of.
	17
	That's tobacco that's smokeable? In other

18
	Q    Okay. Let's keep going.
	18
	words, that can be turned into a cigarette?

19
	A    Urea is another nitrogen-containing
	19
	A    Well, it could be, but it doesn't have any

20
	compound, which is also going to be used to adjust
	20
	nicotine in it.

21
	the pH. So urea is just a nitrogen-containing
	21
	Q    Right. Not there just yet. That is

22
	compound that can be used to adjust the pH.
	22
	tobacco that the companies could use just that right

23
	Q    Okay. It is hard to see at the top of the
	23
	there to make a commercially available cigarette,

24
	video, some - it is a three-digit number gallon
	24
	right?

25
	tank, right?
	25
	A    It is called reconstituted tobacco, it is

	Page   1913
	
	Page   1915

1
	not the meaty part of the tobacco, it's
	i
	the sheet.

2
	reconstituted, made from scraps like stems and
	2
	So some companies use a lot of this type

3
	veins.
	3
	of reconstituted tobacco, others use the paper, some

4
	Q    And if they use just this right here, just
	4
	use a combination of both, but they're both made

5
	this reconstituted tobacco that we see in this clip
	5
	from the tobacco byproducts, and they can be

6
	right here, if they use that to make cigarettes,
	6
	processed to add other things to the mixture.

7
	what we're looking at right there in this video,
	7
	And this is - these are big hogsheads,

8
	would that be an addictive cigarette?
	8
	which are compressed tobacco products, which will

9
	A    No.
	9
	show in the next one when they take the wood off of

10
	Q   Would smokers continue to smoke that
	10
	it. Then these are just great big clumps of tobacco

11
	cigarette?
	11
	that end up being reconstituted in the band case

12
	A    No.
	12
	sort of methodology.

13
	Q   Would they have a free choice to quit?
	13
	And there they are without the wooden

14
	A   Well, they would have no nicotine in the
	14
	slats around them.

15
	cigarette, so they wouldn't continue to smoke it.
	15
	Q    So this is just the tobacco before it's

16
	Q    Okay. Let's keep going.
	16
	broken up to go into the cigarette?

17
	A    So the liquid that was extracted earlier
	17
	A    This is reconstituted tobacco, and the

18
	then is put in this trough, and you can see the
	18
	other methodology, as opposed to the sheet. So

19
	paper is going through the trough and picking up
	19
	there's two methodologies to reconstitute tobacco.

20
	whatever is in that liquid, which could be nicotine
	20
	Q    Okay.

21
	or could be diammonium phosphate, it could be
	21
	A   And this is the end result. This is where

22
	anything else that they wanted to add into that.
	22
	they're putting the filter on the cigarette.

23
	Q    So is the process that we're looking at
	23
	Q    How many cigarettes in a pack?

24
	right here in this picture, the process by which the
	24
	A    20.

25
	nicotine is put back into, along with other
	25
	And now the packs are going - they fill


	Page   1914
	
	Page   1916

1
	chemicals, into the reconstituted tobacco?
	1
	up and they are going through into the cartons.

2
	MR. WEAVER: Objection, leading.
	2
	Q    Okay.

3
	THE COURT: Overruled. You can answer.
	3
	A   And a modern cigarette-making machine will

4
	THE WITNESS: That's correct.
	4
	manufacture 20,000 cigarettes a minute.

5
	BY MR. GDANSKI:
	5
	Q    A minute?

6
	Q    Okay. Just keep going.
	6
	A   A minute.

7
	A   So that sheet, reconstituted tobacco.
	7
	Q    And 1 don't know - it went so fast.

8
	And this is the blending where they have
	8
	At the end you saw them put on the

9
	the real tobacco, the tobacco that's from the lamina
	9
	Marlboro stamp? You might have missed it, but it

10
	and put into big things above it. It goes back and
	10
	was there. Okay.

11
	forth to blend it.
	11
	Has the industry worked over the years -

12
	So the blend, the American blend tobacco
	12
	has the tobacco industry worked over the years to

13
	is burley and flue-cured, which makes up about half
	13
	ensure that the manufacturing process of cigarettes

14
	of the tobacco. The Turkish tobacco makes up a
	14
	is such that they can make as many for as cheap as

15
	small percentage, and the rest is made up of
	15
	possible?

16
	reconstituted tobacco, so it's a combination of all
	16
	A    Well, yes, in the original rolling machine

17
	of the above. So this is the blending process, this
	17
	for tobacco back in the 1800s, 1880s produced a few

18
	thing goes back and forth, back and forth to get the
	18
	thousand a day. These machines will produce 20,000

19
	blend consistent from one end to the other.
	19
	cigarettes a minute. And so the cost of them is

20
	Q    Okay.
	20
	very low, and there are prototypes of new cigarette

21
	A    Now this is a different type of
	21
	manufacturing machines that will make 30- to 40,000

22
	reconstituted tobacco. This is from, basically, the
	22
	cigarettes a minute that will further reduce the

23
	scraps that are there. And this is called - 1 want
	23
	cost.

24
	to say band case, which is - they're bigger clumps,
	24
	Q    I'm going to ask you to speak up a little

25
	and it's dried in a different way than the drying of
	25
	bit, okay?

	11
	want to ask your legal assistant to see if she

	MR. GDANSKI: I'll just need a few minutes

	Q    March 1980. And subject: High nicotine,
	14
	to do that at a break.

15
	low TPM cigarettes.

17
	nicotinic effect (I personally believe most regular

	them right now. To the extent that ~

	A    TPM is total particulate matter. That's

15
	MR. COFER: We don't have the document

16
	because it's a composite document, so we don't
	16

17
	have it here. So 1 would ask one of two things
	17
	MR. GDANSKI: Here's what 1 propose doing.

18
	happen, either they tell us which documents
	18
	1 have the slides that we sent them 48 hours

19
	they will use the day before so 1 can have
	19
	ago, Wednesday evening, that has these exact

20
	them, or they just can give me a copy of the
	20
	images.

21
	document. Typically in trial what happens is
	21
	This is the first time I'm being told that

22
	they bring physical copies of the documents and
	22
	even though we have these exact images shown to

23
	you hand it. So 1 want to look at it and see
	23
	the jury with the quotes from these documents,

24
	whether - rule of completeness.
	24
	you guys, the defense, was not able to figure

25
	But here we have excerpts going up on the
	25
	out what document it was.

1
	Well, I'm saying, if when 1 sent these
	i
	Right, Danny?

2
	images, they wrote back and said, hey, we have
	2
	MR. LEGRA: On Dropbox.

3
	these static images, send us these documents, 1
	3
	MR. GDANSKI: Well, whatever. Someone has

4
	would have had an hour to do that last night or
	4
	this exact piece of paper.

5
	Wednesday night, or yesterday all day someone
	5
	THE COURT: Okay. And we've already been

6
	doing it, easily being able to do it. It's not
	6
	over it.

7
	that hard a process, it just takes more time
	7
	Why don't you do this, then, just so we

8
	than we have right now.
	8
	don't waste the jury's time. Can you go over

9
	So 1 propose that the 25 or so pages that
	9
	and see if there's any --1 mean, we can - 1

10
	have this issue, the defense looks at them
	10
	will reserve as to admissibility if there's

11
	right now and says if there's any genuine or
	11
	anything else, but we will allow Mr. Gdanski to

12
	real objection to any of those documents being
	12
	proceed forward. If there's any rule of

13
	shown in the way they are in the static image
	13
	completeness issues, then we'll address them at

14
	that we sent 48 hours ago, to which no
	14
	the time.

15
	objection was ever voiced, then 1 show them
	15
	MR. COFER: Could we at least have a

16
	now, we hash out the issue right now and we
	16
	ruling that in the future they must send us the

17
	proceed.
	17
	actual documents they're going to use or

18
	MR. COFER: Here's the problem. We have
	18
	bring --

19
	stuff come, then we have amended stuff come, we
	19
	THE COURT: Or the numbers.

20
	don't have stuff come. So it's never really
	20
	MR. COFER: The numbers would be fine.

21
	clear what's going to be used. But it's fine
	21
	THE COURT: Just send the exhibit numbers.

22
	if we actually know what the documents are
	22
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 will make sure we send the

23
	because then we can bring them and we can pull
	23
	numbers. With Dr. Hurt, it gets a little

24
	them.
	24
	complicated. With Dr. Proctor, we already have

25
	But in this instance, we didn't get the
	25
	them.


	Page   1930
	
	Page   1932

1
	documents. We have some images. So all we
	1
	MR. COFER: It shouldn't be complicated

2
	have here are some slides of some images
	2
	because if you take the documents, you pull

3
	without the underlying document.
	3
	excerpts out of them, you know what the

4
	1 may have rule of completeness issues. 1
	4
	documents are, so you could say, "Here's a list

5
	may want to say - and you see they're cut and
	5
	of numbers," and then we wouldn't be here.

6
	paste, read that, read this.
	6
	THE COURT: That's fine. Going forward

7
	And 1 will tell you, the way 1 have always
	7
	just go ahead and please just send them the

8
	done it is when 1 show up with a document, 1
	8
	exhibit numbers. And actually, the clerk needs

9
	have a copy for the other side. The way it
	9
	that as well so she can have a complete listing

10
	typically works is you don't display a document
	10
	of the exhibits coming into evidence too.

11
	until the other side has seen it and until the
	11
	MR. COFER: And then at the end of the

12
	Court says, "Do you have an objection?"
	12
	day, we will talk about schedules.

13
	So 1 do object to just trying to look at,
	13
	THE COURT: Yes, we will talk about

14
	you know, cut and paste, to try to figure it
	14
	schedules. We're going to let the jury go

15
	out. 1 don't have the documents here.
	15
	home, and we'll talk about schedules after

16
	MR. GDANSKI: Here's the issue. For
	16
	that.

17
	example, the document 1 just showed a few
	17
	MS. SCHAEFER: Your Honor, just one

18
	minutes ago, the Lorillard document, 1 sent it
	18
	additional thing. And just for the record, the

19
	to Lorillard just like this. Lorillard came
	19
	reason Lorillard was able to raise theirs is

20
	last night and objected to that document and
	20
	because the slide you saw, we could identify

21
	the objection was overruled.
	21
	from the face of the slide what document it

22
	The next page, 1 sent this Philip Morris
	22
	was.

23
	document to Philip Morris just like this.
	23
	THE COURT: Yeah, we talked about that

24
	MR. COFER: When did you send that to us?
	24
	yesterday.

25
	MR. GDANSKI: Wednesday evening.

1
	Cofer is talking about, you can't tell what the
	i
	were looking at, Philip Morris in 1980. Remember

2
	underlying document is.
	2
	that, Dr. Hurt?

3
	THE COURT:  No, 1 understand. But that's
	3
	A    Yes.

4
	okay. We will address it going forward.
	4
	Q    And we were talking about a TPM and CO

5
	That's not a problem.
	5
	delivering cigarette that can supply adequate

6
	MS. SCHAEFER: And additionally, we are
	6
	nicotine, right?

7
	still missing a few images, so we do need to
	7
	A    Correct.

8
	still follow up with - we have asked for a
	8
	Q   And the title, it is a little hard to

9
	number of missing images for exhibits. So
	9
	read, can you blow up the subject?

10
	that's another difficulty that we are having.
	10
	The subject is: "High Nicotine, Low TPM

11
	So we will continue to follow up with
	11
	cigarettes." Right?

12
	plaintiff's counsel, but occasionally there
	12
	A    Correct.

13
	will be ones we literally don't have the
	13
	Q    And now let's go to Hurt 33 and show it to

14
	exhibits for.
	14
	counsel first.

15
	THE COURT:  1 understand. But Mr.
	15
	MR. COFER: If it's the one that's on the

16
	Gdanski's position is if this had been voiced
	16
	screen, that's fine. But it's not on the

17
	earlier, that it could have been addressed
	17
	screen yet. You know what, that's a different

18
	earlier. So we are where we are, so let's
	18
	document now.

19
	proceed forward, and we'll just address it in
	19
	MR. GDANSKI:  I'm sorry, Hurt 34.

20
	the future going forward.
	20
	Hurt 34, please.

21
	MR. COFER: Can 1 just ask, how many
	21
	BY MR. GDANSKI:

22
	documents like this do you have?
	22
	Q    Dr. Hurt, are you familiar with this

23
	MR. GDANSKI:  14 pages. I don't know how
	23
	document?

24
	many documents. There's 14 pages in there.
	24
	A    Yes, this is one of my slides.

25
	THE COURT: Okay. Well, let's continue to
	25
	Q    It's meant to be so that you can see the


	Page   1934
	
	Page   1936

1
	press forward, as we promised the jury, and
	1
	underlying document, and then a PowerPoint pulls out

2
	then going forward we will address the issue.
	2
	each one at a time, right?

3
	And just give them the exhibit numbers.
	3
	A   Yeah, that's fine. There's some confusion

4
	That's all we need.
	4
	about this. 1 apologize for that.

5
	MR. GDANSKI: They are all part of a
	5
	Q    It's my fault. But we can at least see

6
	composite exhibit.
	6
	the sections from the document that you've taken out

7
	MR. COFER: That's the problem. Here's
	7
	as being particularly important, right?

8
	Composite Exhibit Number 1, 400 documents.
	8
	MR. COFER: May 1 ask, is that all from

9
	Here's a couple of excerpts.
	9
	the same page or how many pages the document

10
	THE COURT: I can foresee the issue. I
	10
	is?

11
	understand. So - but it should have been
	11
	BY MR. GDANSKI:

12
	hashed out before, but that's okay, we'll make
	12
	Q    It is from the same document. All of

13
	sure going forward it's addressed. That's not
	13
	these quotes are from the same underlying document?

14
	a problem.
	14
	A   Yes. And so underneath this would be the

15
	Let's bring the jurors in, please.
	15
	page from which these quotes come.

16
	Doctor, please.

	intent.

4
	A    Correct.
	4
	THE COURT: Overruled.

5
	Q     And this is an industry document, right?
	5
	THE WITNESS: 1 think that's correct too,

6
	A    This is from Philip Morris, yes.
	6
	because that would basically take away one of

	THE COURT: Sustained. Lay the

12
	MR. COFER: Objection, leading, intent,
	12
	MR. COFER: Your Honor, may we approach?

13
	speculation, and lack of foundation.
	13
	THE COURT: Counsel, sidebar, please.

16
	BY MR. GDANSKI:
	16
	MR. COFER: So this is outrageously

17
	Q    Dr. Hurt, are you familiar with the
	17
	improper. How would he possibly know what

18
	reasons why the industry would not and did not admit
	18
	Philip Morris attorneys recommended to the

19
	between 1953 and 1996 that nicotine was addictive
	19
	client? How would he possibly know?

20
	and that people smoke for nicotine?
	20
	They're using a document to argue. The

21
	A    Well, it would have profound potential
	21
	document speaks for itself. We don't even have

22
	ramifications for regulation if they admitted it was
	22
	the underlying document here. But how can this

23
	a drug.
	23
	guy possibly speculate what the Philip Morris

24
	Q    And did they also recognize that it would
	24
	attorneys advised their clients?

25
	have profound ramifications not for regulation only

1
	asked in terms of the industry, that was the
	i
	MR. WEAVER: He can't ask to strategize

2
	basis for my objection on meaning and intent.
	2
	about what the document means, that's for the

3
	MR. COFER: They're doing it on all of
	3
	jury.

4
	these. For example, he takes one line out of
	4
	MR. GDANSKI: Dr. Hurt knows exactly how

5
	addiction in 1959 and said: Did the industry
	5
	the legal position and how -

6
	know that it was addictive?
	6
	THE COURT: Then he needs to explain that.

7
	THE COURT: Mr. Gdanski, any response to
	7
	MR. GDANSKI: And he will. 1 will do that

8
	this?
	8
	now.

9
	MR. GDANSKI: I disagree with all of that,
	9
	THE COURT: But there has to be a basis

10
	but there's good answers to every single
	10
	for his explanation.

11
	question.
	11
	MR. GDANSKI: Sure. The documents reveal

12
	Number one is that Mr. Weaver's objection
	12
	it. 1 mean, there's no pretending that it's

13
	that it's industry versus company, there's a
	13
	part of the historical release of the

14
	finding of conspiracy regarding nicotine
	14
	documents. Under the crime fraud exception,

15
	addiction. So all for one, one for all.
	15
	hundreds of thousands of pages were released of

16
	He does have knowledge. These documents
	16
	legal documents outlining this exact strategy.

17
	were released. We have the documents from
	17
	And he knows that.

18
	Philip Morris attorneys to them laying all of
	18
	THE COURT: Then he needs to indicate

19
	this out. I will show them to this jury right
	19
	where that strategy is written because he

20
	now and I will show them with Dr. Proctor next
	20
	wasn't there at the time. He has no idea what

21
	week, but I will go through the documents from
	21
	the legal strategy is.

22
	the Philip Morris attorneys. You know -
	22
	MR. GDANSKI: Of course not unless we're

23
	MR. COFER: I'd love to see those to know
	23
	there at the time. That's why the documents

24
	which ones you're talking about. Please put
	24
	are revelatory.

25
	them on the list before you do that.
	25
	1 would just assume - I'm saying


	Page   1942
	
	Page   1944

1
	MR. GDANSKI: Well, 1 don't need to do
	1
	that's - in other words, in order to satisfy

2
	that because - but it's just as it relates to
	2
	the Court's concern of you have to know how

3
	this one issue of we can't admit nicotine is
	3
	this happened, only one document is necessary

4
	addictive because that will impact us, that
	4
	to do it, and it's the "lawyers remind us"

5
	document is already in evidence. That's the
	5
	document. And that would be independently

6
	document the lawyers remind us. It's a Shook,
	6
	sufficient.

7
	Hardy & Bacon, which 1 would never say, but
	7
	MR. COFER: You have somebody - wait.

8
	that's the firm saying: Don't admit nicotine
	8
	Hang on. You have one guy from The Tobacco

9
	is addictive, it's just the most potent weapon
	9
	Institute saying to another guy from The

10
	a prosecuting attorney have in a lung cancer
	10
	Tobacco Institute that Shook Hardy - that's a

11
	cigarette case because we can't defend kicking
	11
	law firm, that's not an individual - Shook

12
	smoking is a free choice if a person is
	12
	Hardy reminds us. Who at Shook Hardy? Who at

13
	addicted.
	13
	Shook Hardy? All of that.

14
	MR. COFER: That's hearsay.
	14
	It's double hearsay is what they're trying

15
	THE COURT: Lay the foundation.
	15
	to do. And then they're trying to - and, of

16
	MR. GDANSKI: So you asked me, how does
	16
	course, 1 understand that you've redacted that.

17
	Dr. Hurt knows this? The documents reveal it.
	17
	THE COURT: Overruled this objection.

18
	THE COURT: Well, you need to lay the
	18
	MR. COFER: No, you have redacted that.

19
	foundation. 1 think that's the issue.
	19
	But my point is, the document, the jury

20
	MR. COFER: But the document speaks for
	20
	has seen it. We don't need this guy to now

21
	itself. He puts the document up, the jury has
	21
	start giving opinions about what advice we

22
	seen it. He's made the argument. Well,
	22
	gave, what our legal strategy was.

23
	because 1 read the document, just like the
	23
	THE COURT: So for the record, I'm

24
	jury, so 1 know that's what the attorneys did.
	24
	sustaining your objection to foundation. Lay

25
	He doesn't know.

	16
	witness talk about it in greater detail, but very

17
	Dr. Hurt's deposition in this case, he
	17
	simply: Have you seen documents and reviewed

18
	discussed the lawyers' role in articulating and
	18
	information to substantiate that the attorneys

19
	generating this conspiracy.
	19
	likely continued to insist upon a clandestine effort

20
	THE COURT: But the question is: How does

21
	he come up with that knowledge of the lawyers'
	21
	profile? Have you seen proof of that?

22
	role? That's the issue.
	22

	talked about in the beginning of the afternoon where

5
	something will be sustained, and 1 will miss my

	they didn't acknowledge between '53 and '96 that

6
	opportunity.
	6
	nicotine was addictive and that people smoked for

7
	THE COURT: It's up to you. I'm just

	nicotine, was this successful? Was the effort to

	MR. GDANSKI: 1 know you are.

10
	THE COURT: Just lay your foundation.
	10
	that successful?

11
	That's all.
	11
	MR. COFER: Objection. Vague and

12
	MR. WEAVER: Your Honor, 1 need to alert
	12
	speculation.

13
	the Court to one thing. What we're seeing here
	13
	THE COURT: Sustained. What happened.

14
	is a slow erosion of the Court's ruling that
	14
	BY MR. GDANSKI:

15
	our actions here in this courtroom can't be
	15
	Q    What happened? Did they continue to keep

16
	challenged because every defendant is entitled
	16
	the nicotine in low profile?

17
	to a defense. It's suggesting that our
	17
	A    They did until 1998 when these documents

18
	attorneys say this or our attorneys say that.
	18
	became public.

19
	Mr. Gdanski is very slowly and very

	Q    I'm going to leave the lawyer stuff alone,

20
	methodically laying a foundation for the jury
	20
	come back to it, have another witness talk about it.

21
	to infer or perceive that we're just part of

	motion, which the Court granted, was intended
	24
	earlier was the ammoniation of cigarettes, right?

	inform your understanding of the efforts the

5
	A   Well, it wasn't just ammoniation, it was a
	5
	different. Now let's go to that one.

	manipulation because you could adjust the levels,

	8
	So what smoke compounds lead to harshness,

	ways that it was done.
	9
	Dr. Hurt?

	to harshness.

	A    I am.

	MR. GDANSKI: It's PT01635. Give Mr.

17
	Honor.
	17
	Q    Do you see the word "satisfaction" is in

	THE COURT: Okay. In evidence over

	quotes?

19
	objection.
	19
	A    Correct.

20
	(Plaintiff's Exhibit PT01635 was received in
	20
	Q    Is that the same thing as "addiction"?

21
	evidence.)
	21
	A    That's the hit of nicotine. That's

	23
	brain, it causes a release of the neurotransmitters.

24
	you a question real quick?
	24
	Q    And let's go to page number 8.

25
	Has the tobacco industry, any of the
	25
	And is this document a little bit - a


	Page   1950
	
	Page   1952

1
	companies, at any point in time admitted that
	1

	ammonation in cigarettes makes nicotine get to the

	reader back in time?

3
	brain faster?
	3
	A    It does.

4
	A    No.
	4
	Q    Okay. And so why was the industry doing

5
	Q    This is ROOT Technology, a handbook for
	5
	that? Why did they study not just what was going on

6
	leaf blenders and product developers, right?
	6
	back in time in the manufacturing process, but how

7
	A    That's what it says.
	7
	they got there, how the manufacturing of cigarettes

8
	Q    1991, restricted, not to be copied or
	8
	evolved?

9
	shown to unauthorized persons.
	9
	A    Well, part of it is because Philip Morris

10
	A    Right.
	10
	and Marlboro began to, really, take over the market

11
	Q    That's what it says there?
	11
	in the early part of the 1960s, and so a lot of this

12
	Let's go to page number 6, please.
	12
	effort was to basically retro-engineer the Marlboro

13
	What ammonia does. It poses the question
	13
	cigarette to find out what it was about it that they

14
	again, right?
	14
	were losing sales.

15
	A    Correct.
	15
	That was not only Brown & Williamson, but

16
	Q    "Cigarette smoke, ammonia is entirely
	16
	it was more Reynolds than it was - because

17
	different."
	17
	Reynolds, up until then, had been the leader because

18
	So just got to get a little background,
	18
	of Camel and then Winston.

19
	just take that down one second.
	19
	Q    Okay. There's a lot of information there.

20
	The first paragraph talks about ammonia in
	20
	When did Philip Morris' Marlboro's product

21
	general. Tobacco reacts reducing sugars, degree and
	21
	overtake Reynolds and Camel and Winston as the

22
	type of flavor, complex sequence of reactions that
	22
	leader in the cigarette market?

23
	occur, the detailed chemistry is little understood
	23
	A    It was in the early 1960s. I can't give

24
	but is similar to that involved in production of
	24
	you the exact date, but there's a graph on one of

25
	ammonia caramels, right.
	25
	the documents that shows that.

	introduced RT."

2
	deposition, did he say that him and his brother
	2
	What is RT? Reconstituted tobacco?

4
	1960s?
	4
	Q    Okay. "Into their paper recon process."

5
	A    Yeah, he started out with Camels and
	5
	A    That is correct.

6
	then - for about ten years smoked Camels, and then
	6
	Q    "This was done by adding DAP to the mix.

7
	switched to Marlboros and then smoked those for
	7
	The important point is that PM has never been able

8
	about ten years, as I recall.
	8
	to fully replace RCB with their cheaper paper

9
	Q    Okay. So it says: "At about the same
	9
	recon."

10
	time in the early 1950s, Philip Morris, PM, was also
	10
	"This fact led to the conclusion at Brown

11
	developing a band cast recon."
	11
	& Williamson that RCB is" - what, Dr. Hurt?

12
	What does that mean?
	12
	A    "The soul of the Marlboro."

13
	A    I think I misspoke earlier. I think I

	Q    RCB is the reconstituted blend that had

	said "band case," but it actually is "band cast."
	14
	the diammonium phosphate added to it?

15
	Remember those big lumps of tobacco that were going
	15
	A    That's correct.

16
	up the conveyer, that's called "band cast." And it
	16
	Q    And has history demonstrated that

17
	is different than paper recon, so this is one type
	17
	Marlboro, ever since, overtook Winston in the mid

18
	of reconstituted tobacco.
	18
	1960s, has consistently, every year after year in

	this country, been the number one selling cigarette

20
	economies of fully using stems and tobacco finds."
	20
	brand?

21
	So basically use as much as you can of the

	A    Not only in this country, but in the

22
	product, save as much money, right?
	22
	world.

23
	A    Well, these things look like tobacco, they
	23
	Q    Okay. In the United States, though, every

24
	smell like tobacco, and you can then make them do
	24
	year since it overtook Winston, Marlboro has

25
	things that are not - they're not only scraps, they
	25
	maintained dominance, right?

	were scraps, but they make them into part of the

	A    Correct.

2
	tobacco product.
	2
	Q    It still does to this day, right?

3
	Q    Okay. But PM decided to free most of the

	A    Over 50 percent of the market shares.

4
	pectin -- is it p-e-c-t-i-n?
	4
	Q    Just Marlboro?

5
	A    Pectin.
	5
	A    Just Marlboro.

6
	Q    Pectin. What is that?
	6
	Q    "Confirmation of this conclusion is

7
	A    Well, that's a - 1 can't really explain
	7
	provided by PM's use of RCB in worldwide markets

8
	exactly what it is. It's an organic compound that
	8
	wherever regulations and economies allow, while

9
	when you add diammonium phosphate to it, it causes
	9
	other components do vary. Two recent changes in

	pectins to then become more adhesive. It kind of
	10
	PM's paper recon have been incorporation of urea" -

11
	breaks them up. So that in the sheet-making process
	11
	we saw that in the video, right?

12
	for recon, those pectin make bridges to basically
	12
	A    Right.

13
	hold the paper together. That's why you can have a
	13
	Q    "For harshness reduction. And the use of

14
	sheet of paper that large, because of the pectins
	14
	propylparaben to retard mold growth."

15
	that are affected by diammonium phosphate.
	15
	Take back some mold growth, right?

16
	Q    "Pectin release was accomplished by
	16
	A    1 don't know what propylparaben is -

17
	cooking the slurry with DAP" - that's diammonium
	17
	Q    Okay.

18
	phosphate?
	18
	A    - obviously is a anti-mold, apparently.

19
	A    That's correct.
	19
	Q    Dr. Hurt, as Brown & Williamson put it, is

20
	Q    "And adding more ammonia as necessary to
	20
	ammoniation the soul of the Marlboro cigarette?

21
	maintain the efficient pectin-releasing conditions."
	21
	A    That's what they said, yes.

22
	We call this sheet RCB, right?
	22
	Q    And after Brown & Williamson recognized

23
	A   Yes.
	23
	that Marlboro is adding ammonia, Philip Morris is

24
	Q   Okay. Let's go to page 9, please.
	24
	adding ammonia to Marlboro's cigarettes, and that

3
	ammonia technology is the key to competing with
	3
	A    "Habituating level of nicotine, how low

4
	Philip Morris worldwide, and so they all began to do

7
	you go, it's Hurt 43.

8
	Can you put that on the screen for a

	see what the components are of - or what the

9
	second, please? Thank you.
	9
	ingredients are in cigarette brands manufactured by

10
	So let's go ahead and put that up.
	10
	the companies today?

11
	This a document from Brown & Williamson.
	11
	A    Can you go online and find them?

12
	And you can tell at the top it's released as part of
	12
	Q    Yeah.

13
	the Minnesota tobacco litigation.
	13
	A    There are some things online, yes.

14
	A    Correct.
	14
	Q    But currently if you go to, for example,

15
	Q   And it's got the Brown & Williamson Bates
	15
	Philip Morris' website, can you click on a certain

16
	numbers. And tell us, what does it say?
	16
	brand, a certain subtype, and you can see what the

17
	A    Well, this is really talking - this is an
	17
	component are that they put into the cigarette?

18
	ammonia conference that they held in Louisville -
	18
	A    1 don't think you can do it by brand, but

19
	Q   Where?
	19
	1 actually haven't done that, so...

20
	A    In Louisville.
	20
	Q    Let's see. SER0005. This is - 1 think

21
	Q    Okay. Kentucky. Gotcha.
	21
	you can do it by brand. So I'm going to correct you

22
	A    That's where Brown & Williamson was
	22
	and you can correct me any time I'm wrong, okay?

23
	located, used to be located. And so it was
	23
	A   Okay.

24
	talking - the whole document, which is a fairly
	24
	Q    So currently today - make it a little

25
	long document, talks about ammonia technology, and
	25
	higher, Danny, please, so we can see what we're

	this is kind of the key phrase that cleared it up
	1
	talking about. Marlboro Red.

2
	with confirming, basically, that ammoniation is the
	2
	This is a Marlboro Red label box. You see

3
	key to competing with the smoke quality that Philip

	that, Dr. Hurt?

4
	Morris had.
	4
	A    Ido.

5
	Q    Okay. And let's go ahead and take a look

	It's a Brown & Williamson document.

	A    It's a - it is basically humectant, 1

10
	MR. WEAVER: Do you have the number?
	10
	think, is what it is used for. It is a chemical

11
	MR. GDANSKI: 36.
	11
	compound that is not only used in these products but

12
	MR. WEAVER:  PTO?
	12
	also used in other products as well.

13
	MR. GDANSKI: No, 1 don't have that. It's

	20
	A   Yes, and this is just a partial list, 1

20
	That's Merit Menthol. You see that?

	12
	smoked other low-tar brands, including Merit?

13
	what does it say?
	13
	A   Yes.

14
	THE COURT: Sustain the objection.
	14
	Q    All right. Let's go back to the ELMO for

15

	15
	one minute, please.

16
	Q    Does it say, "low-tar, enriched flavor" on

21
	A    Maybe 12 or 13 years, I think.
	21
	A    No.

22
	Q    Okay. And based on your reading of the
	22
	Q    Why not?

23

2
	fool the machines that measured it, but it didn't
	2
	A    Right.

3
	fool the smokers. So no longer can they use labels
	3
	Q    Now, let's look at a document from Philip

4
	such as "low-tar," "low nicotine," "mild" or other
	4
	Morris regarding Merit cigarettes. And we can

5
	such descriptors.
	5
	switch off the ELMO. You can have a seat, Dr. Hurt.

6
	Q    And what was concluded as part of the

	Let's look at PT04170. And we move that

7
	legislation prohibiting the companies from using a

	into evidence.

24
	A    I didn't know that.

	reported to Laurene, the person that this is to.
	i
	A    Well, the Federal Trade Commission had

2
	Q    And let's just take a look at the first
	2
	machines that measured the nicotine in tar and

3
	paragraph, please.
	3
	cigarettes. When he showed you the tar and nicotine

4
	"From TPD and research department studies
	4
	on the Merit package, 1 think the tar was like 9 and

5
	to date, we have reached certain conclusions
	5
	the nicotine was 0.9.

6
	concerning the Merit cigarette."
	6
	Q    7-9 milligrams, tar. 0.7 milligrams,

7
	So is this Reynolds taking the Merit
	7
	nicotine.

8
	Philip Morris cigarette, studying it, trying to see
	8
	A    So that would be measured in the FTC

9
	what's what?
	9
	machine. So what these machines do, they take a

10
	A    That's correct.
	10
	standard puff of 35 millimeters at certain duration,

11
	Q    And did they ultimately come out with a
	11
	a certain number of puffs over a period of time

12
	competitor to Merit, Vantage?
	12
	until the cigarette is smoked down to a certain

13
	A    They did, yes.
	13
	length. The smoke is collected as it passes over a

14
	Q    "Some of the work originally planned in

	of the Merit project."
	18
	What that does not measure is nicotine in the gas

19
	Let's go to 4, please.
	19
	phase.

20
	They have a section on nicotine. So did
	20
	So if you can do something like they're

21
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company study the nicotine in
	21
	doing here, which basically has the free nicotine

22
	the Merit cigarettes smoked by Debbie Perrotto's
	22
	calculated per puff of 5.5 versus Winston of 3.1,

23
	late husband, Nick Perrotto?
	23
	they're getting a lot of free nicotine that would

24
	A    The description here, yes.
	24
	not be measured on the FTC method.

25
	Q    "From the average pH throughout the
	25
	Q    Winston cigarettes that are referenced in


	Page   1970

	smoking sequence and total nicotine delivery, the
	1
	this document, they're made by the Reynolds company;

2
	calculated free nicotine delivery in micrograms
	2
	A    Correct.

3
	puffed for Merit is 5.5, versus Winston at 3.1,
	3
	Q    Okay. Are Winston cigarettes in their

4
	Vantage at 3.4, Now at 6.0, and Marlboro at 7.2."
	4
	regular form, so just Winston regulars, they're a

5
	Do you see that?
	5
	filtered cigarette, right?

6
	A    I do.
	6
	A   They are, yes.

7
	Q   What does all that mean?
	7
	Q    But are they a light cigarette?

8
	A    Well, the free nicotine is the nicotine
	8
	A    Well, there is Winstons Lights, yes.

9
	that's in the gas form. It's only the free nicotine
	9
	Q    But I'm talking just about regular

10
	that crosses biological membranes.
	10
	Winstons. Does this document say Winston Lights?

11
	So the Federal Trade Commission machine
	11
	A    It does not, it just says Winston.

12
	measurements, which was what was being done at that
	12
	Q    I'm just talking about regular Winston,

13
	time to label the cigarettes, would not capture the
	13
	not the light version.

14
	free nicotine when it would be smoked in a smoking
	14
	A    They call them full-flavored.

15
	machine. So that was one of the things about the
	15
	Q    Full-flavored Winston.

16
	Merit is it was claimed to be low nicotine delivery,
	16
	So in this document where Reynolds is

17
	but they can't - they can't measure the gas phase
	17
	looking at Merit, which is a light cigarette, right?

18
	nicotine through those machines. They only measure
	18
	A    It's proclaimed to be light, yes.

19
	the particulate matter.
	19
	Q    It's marketed as a light cigarette.

20
	Q    And you have seen some of their ads, and
	20
	A    Correct.

21
	the jury is going to see that a little bit later in
	21
	Q    This document where it takes Merit, which

22
	the trial, but when you're talking about these FTC
	22
	is marketed as a light cigarette, and Winston, which

23
	machines, I'm not sure the jury understands what
	23
	is full-flavored, and you want to look at which one

24
	exactly you're talking about. What does that even
	24
	has more free nicotine. Which one has actually more

25
	mean? What's an FTC machine?
	25
	free nicotine?

5
	anything about the fact that the cigarette he was

	that say "light," "low-tar"? It was the last couple

8
	A    There's no way for him to have known that.
	8
	of years, right?

9
	Q    Did people outside the industry know this?
	9
	A    It's been about three or four years. 1

10
	A    We did not.
	10
	can't remember the exact date. It's not been very

11
	Q    Let's go down to the second section.
	11
	long.

12
	And when 1 say people outside the

14
	the Surgeon General, people like that.
	14
	Nick Perrotto was alive, right?

	15
	A    That's correct.

16
	Q    "Miscellaneous smoke components. Merit

10
	Q    Do you have that?

12
	last night, Philip Morris USA. Merit Menthol Gold
	12
	A    Yes.

13
	Pack 100's. Do you see, just so the jury knows what
	13
	Q   And do they still do that to this day in

14
	we're talking about, you see it's called the gold
	14
	order to make sure that the nicotine in cigarettes

15
	pack now?
	15
	gets to the brain faster than otherwise would

16

	16
	without the pH manipulation?

17
	Q   What does that mean, a gold pack?
	17
	MR. COFER: Objection. Calls for

19
	label these as light or low-tar or mild by

	THE COURT: Sustained. Rephrase.

20
	regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, then
	20
	BY MR. GDANSKI:

21
	they did the same thing by colors. So the colors
	21
	Q    1 asked earlier why they put - why they

22
	then represent what would have been a light
	22
	manipulated pH. Why do they do it today?

23
	cigarette, just different colors.
	23
	A   Well, the slope of the curve that 1 showed

24
	So, for example, Marlboro, Marlboro Red is
	24
	you earlier, if it goes more vertical, then the

25
	the full flavor, Marlboro Gold is what used to be
	25
	nicotine reaches the brain faster. So what this

1
	does is it increases the fraction of free nicotine
	i
	A    Well, yeah. It would be a form of

2
	that's already in the smoke, and that makes that
	2
	alcohol, yes.

3
	vertical spike go even more straight up and down.
	3
	Q    Fenugreek. It looks like a food recipe,

4
	It gets to the brain faster.
	4
	right?

5
	Q    Do they still continue to manipulate
	5
	A    It's not something 1 would want to eat.

6
	cigarettes to make them more addictive?
	6
	Q    It's certainly not something we should be

7
	A    They do.
	7
	smoking, something that's combustible, right?

8
	Q   And do they still add licorice to Merit
	8
	MR. COFER: Objection. Leading,

9
	cigarettes?
	9
	argumentative, cumulative.

10
	A    Yes, they do.
	10
	THE COURT: Sustained.

11
	Q    Any reason - they still add menthol, this
	11
	MR. COFER: Could we approach?

12
	is a mentholated version, so menthol is listed
	12
	THE COURT: Counsel, sidebar.

13
	there, right?
	13
	

14
	A    Correct.
	14
	(Thereupon, the following proceedings were

15
	Q   And they put cocoa and carob bean extract

	held at side bar:)

16
	in Merit cigarettes today, right?
	16
	MR. COFER: We had a motion in limine on

17
	A    They do.
	17
	the things that go on post death. 1 don't know

18
	Q    Have you seen a much larger list of all
	18
	whether it's been ruled or not ruled. Here

19
	the different chemicals that Philip Morris adds to
	19
	we're into things that have been going on

20
	their cigarettes?
	20
	today.

21
	A    That was what 1 think 1 was referring to
	21
	We have had the State Farm arguments, we

22
	earlier.
	22
	made objections based on State Farm, but now

23
	Q    Okay. Let's take a look at that, please.
	23
	we're talking about how many years after

24
	There were go.
	24
	Mr. Perrotto died.

25
	So this is from last night. Or
	25

1
	10/30/2014. And it's "Tobacco & Flavor Ingredients,

	of this in Phase 1?

2
	Philip Morris USA." It goes through all the
	2
	THE COURT: I've never seen this come in.

3
	different ingredients, right?
	3
	I didn't let this come in in Tullo.

4
	A    Correct. It is a longer list anyway.
	4
	MR. GDANSKI: I think it did. It's

5
	Q   And just so the jury is clear, these
	5
	interesting, though, isn't it? I think it's

6
	ingredients are things that while they may also be
	6
	relevant. I've never had a problem keeping it

7
	found in the product naturally when it's combusted,
	7
	out of a trial. Listen, if I had a list of all

8
	this is a list of the ingredients that Philip Morris
	8
	the ingredients that were used back in 1994, I

9
	adds during the manufacturing process, right?
	9
	would use that.

10
	A    That's correct.
	10
	MR. COFER: It's irrelevant.

11
	Q    Okay. So there's ammonia hydroxide still
	11
	See, here's the deal. So we have - and

12
	listed there, right?
	12
	we need to talk about timing schedule. We have

13
	A    Yes.
	13
	a number of motions in limine, we have a number

14
	Q    Benzyl alcohol?
	14
	of Daubert motions, we have lots of things that

15
	A    I can't see it.
	15
	haven't been ruled, they haven't been ruled

16
	Q    Blow it up a little bit. Perfect.
	16
	because just of the timing situation.

17
	Can you see it now?
	17
	Still we haven't gotten out of realtime

18
	A    Yes.
	18
	and we're pointing to stuff that has nothing to

19
	Q    Benzyl alcohol, cardamom seed oil, celery
	19
	do with Nick Perrotto.

20
	seed oil, carob bean extract, chamomile flavor,
	20
	And I understand the ruling on Williams,

21
	Hungarian oil.
	21
	but at some point, at some point it becomes too

22
	Let's go to the next page, please.
	22
	much and it becomes more 403. And essentially

23
	Citric acid, cocoa, coffee, coriander,
	23
	you've got -and he's doing a great job, been

24
	dill, lots of different ethyls. What's that,
	24
	up here basically just kind of doing a one-man

	and it's fun.
	i
	address the issues now. Is that okay?

2
	And 1 object. But here's the problem.
	2
	MR. GDANSKI: I'm going to be leaving

3
	Every time 1 object, you sustain it, and then
	3
	then, so no, it's not okay for me.

4
	he just redoes it. And so it's a double
	4
	MR. COFER: Well, you're not leaving at

5
	whammy. 1 can either listen to Gdanski do it
	5
	3:15, are you?

6
	once or 1 can listen to Gdanski do it once and
	6
	MR. GDANSKI: No, no, no, she's saying if

7
	Hurt do it a second time. And it's just
	7
	we do it at 4:00. I'm going to leave at 4:00

	if we stop.

	THE COURT: I'm happy to stop now. We can

10
	MR. GDANSKI: Well, there's a couple of
	10
	address these issues.

11
	issues. First of all, in the questions and
	11
	MR. GDANSKI: Stop now for the day?

12
	answers, he's doing a pretty good job of
	12
	THE COURT: Yes.

13
	objecting, and Your Honor 1 know will shut me
	13
	MR. GDANSKI: What issue are we going to

14
	down, so I'm not worried about that.
	14
	address?

15
	Here's my real problem. Not even the
	15
	MR. COFER: There are some issues post

16
	evidentiary issue, I'm not even going to get
	16
	death conduct. We're going to discuss the

17
	there, 1 turned this over to them. They had
	17
	issues about giving us the exhibits in advance.

18
	this. I'm getting ready to do my examination.
	18
	MR. GDANSKI: I will stop using this right

19
	They have this. If there was an objection to
	19
	now, move on, deal with it later, and just keep

20
	it, tell me. This was all turned over. It was
	20
	going. I'm not going to stop now for the day.

21
	turned over 48 hours - one second.
	21
	THE COURT: We'll just table this. We'll

22
	1 didn't give them that much. 1 really
	22
	keep going. All right.

23
	didn't.

	Q    Dr. Hurt, does the tobacco industry add

4
	it again because yesterday Mr. Cofer had one
	4
	high fructose corn syrup to the cigarettes that they

5
	set and we had to do everybody, so last night

	manufacture?

6
	we sent it to him. This morning Your Honor
	6
	MR. COFER: Objection as to time.

7
	ruled on different things, in out, in out. And
	7
	THE COURT: Sustained.

8
	this was one of them that just nobody voiced an
	8
	BY MR. GDANSKI:

9
	issue with. They knew the date on them. It's
	9
	Q    Back when Mr. Perrotto smoked it, did they

10
	got the date. 1 printed them out last night
	10
	add sugars like high fructose corn syrup?

11
	from my computer.
	11
	A    1 think so, yes.

12
	THE COURT: This didn't come in in Cohen
	12
	Q   Was there ever a cigarette manufactured,

13
	and Tullo. 1 would have remembered this.
	13
	during the time that Nick was alive, where on the

14
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 can't imagine 1 didn't use
	14
	side it listed the ingredients so that someone could

15
	this in Cohen. Tullo 1 might not have known
	15
	say, "Hey, there's ammonium hydroxide in here and

16
	about how cool the ingredients were.
	16
	high fructose corn syrup and cocoa, what is all that

17
	MR. COFER: It was dated 10/30.

	MR. GDANSKI: I'll use the one dated

	Cohen.
	19
	Q    As a physician, would that have been

	important for smokers to know?

	website.
	21
	A    Yes.

22
	THE COURT: But, I mean, the issue is --
	22
	Q    Why?

23
	why don't we do this. If you want - I'm
	23
	A    Well, it would have been important for

	sold nationally and internationally on this issue?

13
	BY MR. GDANSKI:
	13
	A    Yes.

14
	Q   You're not going to be able to show what's
	14
	MR. COFER: Unless Mr. Perrotto smoked a

15
	what from sitting up there on the ELMO.
	15
	cigarette -

16
	A    Okay.
	16
	THE COURT: Counsel, sidebar, please.

17
	MR. GDANSKI: Can 1, Judge, pass out the

	(Thereupon, the following proceedings were

	Merit cigarette pack to the jury?
	18
	held at side bar:)

19
	THE COURT: Any objection?
	19
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 will say Nick Perrotto did

20
	MR. COFER: No objection.
	20
	not smoke these cigarettes. We're talking

21
	THE COURT: Okay. Certainly.
	21
	about cigarette design education.

22
	BY MR. GDANSKI:
	22
	MR. COFER: See, here's the problem. So

23
	Q    So go ahead, what do we see on the ELMO?
	23
	we have got motions in limine about time, about

24
	A   So these are the ventilation holes, the
	24
	outside the United States, and he keeps

25
	perforations. They don't show up real well here.
	25
	slipping the stuff in. And so this is now -


	Page   1986
	
	Page   1988

1
	Probably the best way would be to show a light from
	1
	and the slipping was intentional this time.

2
	the back side so you can see.
	2
	So we have death in '98. He stopped

3
	So there's laser perforations in the
	3
	smoking in -

4
	filter-tipping paper which allows air to be drawn in
	4
	THE COURT: 1 understand. He's just using

5
	to the train of smoke.
	5
	it for demonstrative purposes. 1 will give the

6
	Q    Is that a little better?
	6
	jury a limiting instruction that it's solely

7
	A    Much, much better, yeah. So can you see
	7
	for demonstrative purposes.

8
	them.
	8
	MR. GDANSKI: I'll tell them right now.

9
	These are laser perforations. There are
	9
	I'll do it.

10
	different ways of doing that, but this is the most
	10
	MR. COFER: No, 1 would rather you do it.

11
	sophisticated way to do it. So this would be a
	11
	Here's what 1 would like to have happen, 1

12
	regular full-flavored Merit. The label is low, but
	12
	would like him to ask questions, and 1 would

13
	not ultra low.
	13
	like the witness to answer.

14
	Q    All right. And have you actually studied,
	14
	THE COURT: Okay. All right.

15
	cut open, looked at the different ventilation holes
	15
	(Thereupon, the sidebar was concluded and the

16
	that are put into different brands of cigarettes?
	16
	following proceedings were held in open court.)

17
	A    1 have.
	17
	THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, we're

18
	Q    Okay. So let's go ahead and look at a
	18
	going to be showing - putting that slide back

19
	couple of those, please. Just walk us through the
	19
	up, but that slide is being used for

20
	slides, and you tell us what we're looking at.
	20
	demonstrative purposes only.

21
	A    Okay. So this is a cigarette from
	21
	All right. You may continue, Mr. Gdanski.

22
	Holland, a Dutch Marlboro. And these are called
	22
	BY MR. GDANSKI:

23
	electrostatic perforations. So these are made by
	23
	Q    Obviously, Dr. Hurt, Nick Perrotto did not

24
	passing the tipping paper through an electrostatic
	24
	smoke Dutch cigarettes, right?

25
	field, and the electricity punches holes in the

	Q    No one is contending that he did.
	i
	carcinoma of the lung.

2
	So tell us what these are.
	2
	So it didn't change the disease pattern as

3
	A    These are electrostatic perforations which
	3
	far as total disease, but it did change the mix of

4
	are ventilation holes that do the same thing that
	4
	the types of lung cancer.

5
	the laser perforations do. But there is one of the
	5
	Q    That's super important. Let's break all

6
	Merit Ultra Light that shows ventilation holes that
	6
	that down.

7
	were perforations.
	7
	Nick Perrotto, he had a lobectomy, right?

8
	Q    Let's go ahead and see that.
	8
	A    He did.

9
	And again, just to be clear, this is a
	9
	Q    And what's a lobectomy?

10
	Merit Ultra Light. This was made in 2000.
	10
	A    Well, the lung is separated into various

11
	Nick, unfortunately, was not alive
	11
	lobes. And so his was in the right upper lobe. So

12
	anymore, right?
	12
	there's a right upper lobe and a right lower lobe.

13
	A    Right.
	13
	And on the left side there's three lobes.

14
	Q    This is for demonstrative purposes.
	14
	So they resected his right upper lobe.

15
	A    This one shows two rows of ventilation
	15
	That's where his 7-centimeter cancer was.

16
	holes as opposed to one, and you saw in that one
	16
	Q    Did they just take out just the cancer or

17
	that those are a little bit further apart, there are
	17
	they took out the whole right upper lobe?

18
	fewer holes, so that would entrain less air than
	18
	A    The took out the whole right upper lobe

19
	this one would. And we've got a -- we have a slide
	19
	plus lymph nodes that were in the mediastinum.

20
	that shows the way this works as far as the
	20
	Q    We're going to about that in a minute.

21
	ventilation holes and the smoke going out through
	21
	We'll talk about his whole medical course with you.

22
	them.
	22
	But right now, just when they took out his

23
	So this would be the type of cigarette he
	23
	right upper lobe, did a doctor look at it under a

24
	smoked, light.
	24
	microscope and say, "Here's what kind of cancer 1

25
	Now, in a different slide...
	25
	see"?


	Page   1990
	
	Page   1992

1
	Q    1 don't see the one you're talking about,
	1
	A    Yes.

2
	Dr. Hurt. So just tell us what we're seeing.
	2
	Q    And what kind of cancer did that doctor

3
	A    Well, it shows the cigarette rod with the
	3
	say?

4
	smoke coming out of the end of it and the
	4
	A    It was adenocarcinoma of the lung.

5
	ventilation holes. With one row of holes like this
	5
	Q    Okay. Adenocarcinoma of the lung.

6
	one would be, the smoke would be less - would be
	6
	Now, what does adenocarcinoma of the lung

7
	more dense than if it had two rows of ventilation
	7
	have to do with filters on cigarettes and

8
	holes like the Merit Ultra Light.  It really didn't
	8
	perforation holes? What is the relationship?

9
	make any difference to the smoker because they would
	9
	A   Well, as 1 mentioned earlier, back when

10
	compensate, they would smoke it more aggressively.
	10
	cigarettes were not designed this way, the most

11
	Q    1 have a question for you. Do these
	11
	common type of lung cancer was squamous cell lung

12
	ventilation holes that are on the Merit Menthol on
	12
	cancer, because it was more centrally located in the

13
	the double row, on the Merit Menthol Ultra Lights,
	13
	major bronchial tubes. Because people smoked these

14
	would that make cigarettes any bit safer to someone
	14
	cigarettes differently, by inhaling deeper, holding

15
	like Nick?
	15
	their breath longer, pushing the smoke further into

16
	A    No.
	16
	the periphery of the lung, that's where

17
	Q    Why not in this case to Nick, why not?
	17
	adenocarcinoma begins.

18
	A    Well, not make it safer. The perception
	18
	And today, 1 think, adenocarcinoma makes

19
	was that they were safer, and they smoked them for
	19
	up about 40 percent of all lung cancers, which is

20
	health reassurance reasons. But the main thing that
	20
	different than it was 20 years ago.

21
	changed during this course of time when these light
	21
	Q    And do you know that the 2014 Surgeon

22
	cigarettes were marketed heavily is the types of
	22
	General report concludes -

23
	lung cancer changed to more people developing

	24
	THE COURT: Sustained. Just rephrase.

15
	Q    Are you familiar with the amount of

	THE WITNESS: It was a contributor.

16
	smoking necessary to increase somebody's risk for
	16
	BY MR. GDANSKI:

17
	developing lung cancer?
	17
	Q    Okay. And based on your -

18
	A    There are kind of two factors. One, when
	18
	A    1 guess the point is that had he - he

19
	they started. The younger they start, the higher
	19
	smoked the cigarettes for the effect of nicotine, so

20
	the risk. And the longer they smoke, the higher the
	20
	all of them are kind of on the continuum of that

21
	risk.
	21
	leading to his lung cancer.

22
	Q    Okay. And put that in mind as a
	22
	Q    Sure. I'm just going through each of the

23
	physician, did Nicholas Perrotto's smoking of Camel
	23
	companies one by one so that the testimony is

24
	cigarettes based on his brother's testimony often
	24
	crystal clear, okay?

25
	years, was that independently sufficient to increase

1
	his risk causing him lung cancer?
	1
	Q    All right. So just back to Newport for a

2
	A    Yes.
	2
	second, just like we did with Camels.

3
	MR. WEAVER: Objection.

	Was his smoking of the Newport cigarettes,

	BY MR. GDANSKI:

12
	Q    The same thing with Camels - sorry.
	12
	Q    And did it - did his smoking of Newport

13
	The same thing with the Merits and the
	13
	cigarettes, by Lorillard Tobacco Company, actively

14
	Marlboros, did Nicholas Perrotto's smoking of the

	Nick Perrotto had and died from?

	THE COURT: Overruled.

18
	A    They were contributors.
	18
	THE WITNESS: It all did, yes.

19
	Q    Okay. And did he certainly smoke
	19
	BY MR. GDANSKI:

20
	Marlboros and Merit cigarettes by Philip Morris for
	20
	Q    And did all of them contribute to his

	a long enough period of time to, all by themselves,
	21
	addiction?

22
	cause his lung cancer?
	22
	A    They did. And had he not had the

	A    Yes.
	23
	addiction, he would have been able to stop smoking.

24
	Q    And you saw there was testimony about his

	THE COURT: Okay. Let's wait and see if

	A    Correct.

3
	there's any objection.
	3
	Q    Is there also a lung transplant program?

4
	MR. WEAVER: No additional objection.
	4
	A    There is.

10
	Q    Possible IBT projects, May 24, 71.
	10
	they do a lung transplant on a person if they see

11
	Absorption of nicotine in mouth versus lung, lung
	11
	they still have nicotine in their system?

12
	levels versus urine levels.
	12
	A    That's the whole point of doing the

13
	Actually reminds me of something.
	13
	testing, and so if they're still smoking - what we

14
	In the Mayo Clinic are there tests that
	14
	know about this is if a person, who is on the heart

15
	you can do to actually test how much nicotine
	15
	transplant list, has continued to smoke, the new

16
	someone has in their body?
	16
	heart, if they were to get one, would be affected by

17
	A    Yes.
	17
	the smoking even faster than their old heart was.

18
	Q   Are there breathalyzers for it?
	18
	And that's been shown from the UK before.

19
	A    No, the breathalyzers measure the carbon
	19
	So it's a - and there's a limited number

20
	monoxide.
	20
	of hearts, so the surgeons are really particular

21
	Q    Carbon monoxide. Okay.
	21
	about that.

22
	How do you test now to see if someone has
	22
	Q    Okay. Habituating level of nicotine. How

23
	nicotine in their body?
	23
	low can we go, right?

24
	A   Well, I can test saliva or blood or urine,
	24
	A    That's correct.

25
	all have standard levels of nicotine.
	25
	Q    Is there a difference between a habit and


	Page   2002
	
	Page   2004

1
	Q    Why does the Mayo Clinic do that?
	1
	an addiction?

2
	A    Well -
	2
	A    Well, we don't like the word "habit"

3
	Q    Why do physicians do it?
	3
	because it really trivializes the addiction part of

4
	A    Well, we do it in our treatment program to
	4
	this. A habit is a repetitive behavior, and you can

5
	gauge the level of addiction for the person when
	5
	have all kinds of different habits that don't cause

6
	they come into our residential program, for example.
	6
	disease and disability. So we prefer "addiction" or

7
	So by measuring a metabolite of nicotine
	7
	"dependence."

8
	called cotinine, we can get an idea what their
	8
	But in those days, back in 1971, they were

9
	nicotine exposure has been over the last several
	9
	talking about habituating levels, and so in this

10
	days; and then we can target that level, what we're
	10
	context, habituating level would be related to the

11
	going to use for nicotine replacement, like nicotine
	11
	threshold level of nicotine because they would not

12
	patches.
	12
	want to go below a certain level because then people

13
	So if they have a blood cotinine of 400,
	13
	would not start smoking and people wouldn't continue

14
	we would start out with at least two patches,
	14
	to smoke.

15
	sometimes three patches, to get them adequate
	15
	Q    In 1964, when the Surgeon General said

16
	coverage. That's how we use it clinically.
	16
	nicotine is habituating, was that because addiction

17
	In our heart transplant program, they are
	17
	had a definition that required intoxication?

18
	used to identify smokers, because our heart
	18
	A    Well, it was based on the WHO definition

19
	transplant surgeons don't want to transplant a heart
	19
	at that time, they continued to use that definition.

20
	into a person who has continued to smoke. So if we
	20
	In the same year, the WHO changed their definition

21
	detect that, they're referred to us to for treatment
	21
	and excluded intoxication.

22
	before they can get on the heart transplant list.
	22
	And, in fact, habituating drugs at that

23
	It's used in two or three different ways.
	23
	time, nicotine was classified as a habituating drug.

24
	Q    In the Mayo Clinic you mentioned
	24
	Using that same standard, cocaine would have been

25
	transplant program, you said --1 think you said
	25
	classified as an habituating drug and not an

	addicting drug. So it was just a matter of the
	i
	Morris?

2
	semantics of the definition.
	2
	A    Philip Morris.

3
	Q    Okay. What year was it that the WHO
	3
	Q    Okay. And it says here on point number 3:

4
	removed intoxication from the criteria for
	4
	"Enough nicotine to do" - what?

5
	addiction?
	5
	A    To keep smokers hooked.

6
	A    1 think it was around'64 or'65. It was
	6
	Q    Keep smokers hooked.

7
	around the time of the Surgeon General's report.
	7
	Philip Morris made sure there was just

8
	Q    Okay. And so this is Murray Senkus, do
	8
	enough nicotine to keep the smoker hooked.

9
	you know who he is?
	9
	MR. COFER: Objection, Your Honor. 1

10
	A   Yes.
	10
	mean -

11
	Q   Who is he?
	11
	THE COURT: He's simply reading from the

12
	A    He is at Reynolds. And this guy, Laurene,
	12
	document? Is that what he's doing, Mr.

13
	was in charge of the chemical division of this, and
	13
	Gdanski?

14
	Senkus was his boss.
	14
	What's the question?

	15
	BY MR. GDANSKI:

16
	T-A-M-O-L?
	16
	Q    Now I'm asking the question:

17
	A    I've heard of him. 1 don't know him, but
	17
	Historically, has Philip Morris ensured that there

18
	I've heard of him.
	18
	was just enough nicotine to keep the smoker hooked?

19
	Q   You don't actually know any of these
	19
	A    They did.

20
	people, right?
	20
	Q    And was Nick Perrotto one of many millions

21
	A    No.
	21
	of people who were hooked?

22
	Q    Have you ever met any of them?
	22
	A    Correct.

23
	A    1 met Dr. Colby one time.
	23
	Q    We talked about William Dunn earlier,

24
	Q    Okay. But Ron Tamol you've heard about as
	24
	right?

25
	an employee of Philip Morris?
	25
	A    Yes.


	Page   2006
	
	Page   2008

1
	A    Correct.
	1
	Q    Okay. And you're familiar with something

2
	Q    Okay. Just a lot of these folks were
	2
	that he - a document he wrote for a speech that he

3
	smart guys, right?
	3
	was going to give titled "Motives and Incentives in

4
	A    Oh, they're very smart.
	4
	Cigarette Smoking"?

	This was part of a conference somewhere in

	yes.
	4
	it at the level which it's actually consumed?

5
	Q   And afterwards there was a publication, a
	5
	A    It makes it convenient. It is a small

6
	book, that had different aspects of the research

	package, it fits in a small pocket or small

7
	done there?

8
	A    It had the same title, but it didn't have
	8
	Q    "Its contents are instantly accessible."

9
	the same content that was in this speech.
	9
	Has that been historically true?

10
	Q    Okay. Let's take a look at what Mr. Dunn
	10
	A    Correct.

11
	has to say in this document.
	11
	Q    "Think of the cigarette as a dispenser for

12
	"Nicotine is the active constituent of
	12
	a dose unit of nicotine. It is readily prepped for

13
	cigarette smoke. Without nicotine, the argument
	13
	dispensing a container. Its rate of combustion

14
	goes, there would be no smoking. Some strong
	14
	meters the dispensing rate, setting up a safer limit

15
	evidence can be marshaled to support this argument.
	15
	for a substance that can be toxic in large doses."

16
	No one has ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking
	16
	That's nicotine, right?

17
	cigarettes without nicotine."
	17
	A    That's correct.

18
	Is that right?
	18
	Q   And go to page number 6, please.

19
	A    That's correct.
	19
	"Smoke is beyond question the most

20
	Q    And have you, in your entire professional
	20
	optimized vehicle of nicotine and the cigarette the

21
	career, seen anything to dispute that?
	21
	most optimized dispenser of smoke." Right?

22
	A    No.
	22
	A    That's what he says.

23
	Q    Okay. And let's go to page number 5,
	23
	Q    And unless Nick Perrotto was going to go

24
	please.
	24
	to a library and buy a book called Motives and

25
	"The cigarette is, in fact, among the most

	of this, right?

3
	conceived not as a product but as a package."
	3
	A    That's correct.

4
	And 1 ask you, Doctor, what was the real
	4
	MR. COFER: For rule of completeness, Your

5
	product, the essence of the product that the
	5
	Honor, can we display and read the last

	MR. GDANSKI: Sure.

9
	Q    The cigarette is but one of - just keep

	What's the page?

10
	reading that one section.

11
	"The cigarette is but one of many package
	11
	if you would highlight that and show it to the

	17
	yellow so the jury can see.

	MR. GDANSKI: I'm just looking for what

	3
	you're talking about.

4
	Q    Okay. July 1973.

	Yeah, sure. Let's list the whole

	And if we drop just to the bottom, just to

	Can you put that in context for us?

15
	nicotine satisfaction is the thing that gets people

	"We have deliberately played down the role

11
	to do with his hands and the like. Only after

	reinforcing of the reward mechanism. He probably

12
	experiencing smoking for some period of time do the

	had some of that, but he also had withdrawals, so

13

	"Indeed, the first smoking experience is

	22
	Q    Let's go to page 6.

23
	Okay. The question is: There are two

	"If, as proposed above, nicotine is the

24
	different markets they're referring to. What's the
	24

	or elimination of nicotine from our products, then
	i
	direct?

2
	we shall eventually" - what?
	2
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 think 1 can finish him in

3
	A    -- "liquidate our business."
	3
	about 40 minutes.

4
	Q    "Liquidate our business."
	4
	THE COURT: 40 minutes on direct, and then

5
	If we take nicotine out of cigarettes, we
	5
	we'll be ready on cross. So we will be

6
	will go out of business, right?
	6
	finished with him before lunch?

7
	A    That's what it says.
	7
	MR. GDANSKI: With my direct.

8
	Q    Instead they opted to continue to sell
	8
	THE COURT: Well, with the direct and --1

9
	cigarettes with nicotine in it at addictive levels,
	9
	assume - if the cross isn't going to be that

10
	right?
	10
	long.

11
	A    Even today.
	11
	MR. COFER: Oh, no, it's gotten longer.

12
	MR. GDANSKI: 4:00 on the dot.
	12
	THE COURT: Okay. It's gotten longer. So

13
	THE COURT: All right. Thank you,
	13
	it will be longer then.

14
	Mr. Gdanski.
	14
	So with Dr. Hurt, we'll anticipate he will

15
	Ladies and gentlemen, let me go ahead and
	15
	need to be here all day on Monday.

16
	release you for the weekend. Let me give you
	16
	1 have to take a longer lunch recess on

17
	the same instructions. One, do not discuss the
	17
	Monday. 1 have to speak at a seminar. So it

18
	case with anyone this weekend. Two, don't post
	18
	will be a slightly longer lunch recess. I'll

19
	anything on the Internet regarding the case.
	19
	try to run over there and come back as quickly

20
	Three, do not do any research on any of the
	20
	as 1 can.

21
	issues or any of the individuals involved in
	21
	So also, you said you had another

22
	this case.
	22
	deposition on Monday?

23
	We'll start Monday morning at 9:30.
	23
	MR. GDANSKI: Yeah, 1 think, depending on

24
	Remember, Tuesday is a court holiday, Veteran's
	24
	whatever time it is, ultimately Dr. Neimark's

25
	Day, so we do not have court on Tuesday.
	25
	deposition is going to be played and Santo

1
	We'll see everybody on Monday. Have a
	1
	Perrotto's deposition is going to be played.

2
	wonderful weekend, everyone.
	2
	It doesn't make the slightest bit of

3
	(The jury exited the courtroom at 4:00 p.m.)
	3
	difference to me personally which one is going

4
	THE COURT: Don't go anywhere,
	4
	to be played Monday. So it's just a matter of

5
	Mr. Gdanski. We have some issues to discuss.
	5
	timing. One is longer than the other. 1 think

6
	Counsel ready?
	6
	Dr. Neimark's is longer than Santo's.

7
	MR. GDANSKI: Sure.
	7
	MR. COFER: Is it Neimark or Neimark?

8
	THE COURT: Mr. Gdanski, 1 want you to
	8
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 think it is Neimark or

9
	please this weekend deliver to defendants the
	9
	Neimark. In any event, N-e-i-m-a-r-k.

10
	list of the exhibits for the remaining portions
	10
	So 1 thought about this over lunch because

11
	of Dr. Hurt's testimony, and then 1 want
	11
	1 hate to take up time, it's one of the worst

12
	defense counsel under the 48-hour rule to
	12
	parts of trial, doing deposition designations.

13
	indicate any specific objections. So if
	13
	THE COURT: That's why we're talking.

14
	counsel will do that, then we can avoid some of
	14
	MR. GDANSKI: And Your Honor is, as we all

15
	the delay today as well.
	15
	know -

16
	MR. COFER: Can we talk about scheduling?
	16
	THE COURT: - very, extremely patient

17
	THE COURT: That's number three on my
	17
	with you guys.

18
	list.
	18
	MR. GDANSKI: Super patient, but also this

19
	MR. COFER: Okay. I'll shhhh.
	19
	is not your first time trying one of these

20
	THE COURT: Yes.
	20
	cases, and you have a feel for what comes in

21
	With regards to - 1 assume Dr. Hurt will
	21
	and comes out, and so 1 would just as soon

22
	be the first witness on Monday?
	22
	propose, as we have done in other cases, that

23
	MR. GDANSKI: Yes.
	23
	we give Your Honor - 1 hate to task you with

24
	THE COURT: So we will finish Hurt.
	24
	looking over it, but when you see what our

25
	How much longer do you anticipate on
	25
	objections are, what we can't work out, can you

	Page   2033
	
	Page   2035

1
	just rule on them, and we'll live with your
	i
	MR. GDANSKI: Tuesday we won't be here, so

2
	rulings, except for the ones that we are ready
	2
	Wednesday.

3
	to argue?
	3
	THE COURT: So Proctor is Wednesday.

4
	THE COURT: The objections are already
	4
	And then you will have the plaintiff after

5
	filed?
	5
	that?

6
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 think so, yeah, all of
	6
	MR. GDANSKI: And then a couple of

7
	them have been filed. Because in Cohen we
	7
	doctors.

8
	spent hours doing designations.
	8
	THE COURT: When do you expect to rest?

9
	THE COURT: Well, 1 need the transcripts
	9
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 think the Monday

10
	and 1 need to know specifically the
	10
	thereafter.

11
	designations and the objections.
	11
	MR. WEAVER: So no Prochaska?

12
	MR. GDANSKI: They have this awesome
	12
	MR. COFER: No.

13
	system of marking it up.
	13
	1 think they need to rest on Friday,

14
	THE COURT: 1 remember the colors.
	14
	right? Because we need a little time because

15
	MR. GDANSKI: They have a great program
	15
	we have Monday and Tuesday, and then we have

16
	they won't share with me.
	16
	closing argument.

17
	So my experience is usually it all comes
	17
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 have a question. When we

18
	in.
	18
	had the pretrial conference with Your Honor, 1

19
	THE COURT: Somebody just needs to give
	19
	was listening on the phone from about 10,000

20
	them to me because 1 haven't seen them. So I'm
	20
	miles away, but I'm pretty sure, we checked the

21
	happy to do that for you-all this weekend, so
	21
	transcript, that you told us that if we spill,

22
	we'll take care of that.
	22
	we could spill two or three days after the

23
	Let me just ask you -
	23
	20th. I checked it last night.

24
	MR. WEAVER: Your Honor, they're not
	24
	THE COURT: I said if necessary.

25
	prepared yet.
	25
	MR. GDANSKI: I'm not saying I anticipate


	Page   2034
	
	Page   2036

1
	THE COURT: Then 1 guess 1 can't do that.
	1
	doing it, I'm not saying I want to do it, but

2
	MR. WEAVER: Yeah, 1 mean, had we known,
	2
	I'm just saying when we stood up yesterday,

3
	we could have been working on that days ago.
	3
	everyone's like, "The 20th and then we're

4
	MR. GDANSKI: The color-coordinated ones
	4
	done."

5
	aren't?
	5
	I was like, wait a second, that's not

6
	MR. WEAVER: 1 don't believe they are with
	6
	really what I recall saying "if necessary." I

7
	the objections. We filed page and line
	7
	don't want to do it, but I didn't know that we

8
	objections, yes.
	8
	were foreclosed on that -

9
	THE COURT: Okay.
	9
	THE COURT: Well, we are trying to -

10
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 think even on -- when it's
	10
	that's why I want to have a specific schedule.

11
	prepared, we will get it to you ~
	11
	Let me just go over your schedule, then.

12
	MR. WEAVER: Yeah.
	12
	You don't have to tell me the exact witnesses

13
	MR. GDANSKI: -- as quick as we can.
	13
	and what order. So that way, if we're cutting

14
	THE COURT: So we have a seamless Monday,
	14
	witnesses, let's address that issue.

15
	someone is going to work on this tonight,
	15
	So you're going to go ahead and have - we

16
	tomorrow sometime? Get the color coding done?
	16
	will finish Hurt, you're going to go ahead and

17
	Email it to me at home, 1 will look at it
	17
	do Neimark and Santo Perrotto. You're going to

18
	at home, and we'll take care of it and will be
	18
	have Dr. Proctor sometime on Wednesday.

19
	ready on Monday.
	19
	MR. GDANSKI: Wednesday, yes.

20
	MR. WEAVER: That's Neimark and Santo.
	20
	THE COURT: And who else do you got?

21
	THE COURT: 1 will do that for you guys
	21
	MR. GDANSKI: I have Debbie; I have

22
	this weekend.
	22
	Dr. Neal Rothschild.

23
	Now, let me ask you your schedule
	23
	THE COURT: Okay. Live or by deposition?

24
	basically after that.
	24
	MR. GDANSKI: Live.

25
	When is Proctor coming?
	25
	And I have Dr. David Alley.

	THE COURT: Live or by deposition?
	i
	more efficient, and that's why we're discussing

2
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 believe that's by
	2
	it now we're conferencing it now, to make sure

3
	deposition.
	3
	it could be smoother and more efficient.

4
	THE COURT: Okay. Give me the

	That's all I'm trying to do.

5
	depositions. If you guys are ready, 1 will
	5
	MR. COFER: So here's my contribution, we

6
	look at them this weekend.
	6
	will withdraw Dr. Cox, so you don't need to be

7
	MR. GDANSKI: And 1 have game time
	7
	at the deposition on Sunday.

8
	decisions on two other - there's Michael

	THE COURT: See, there's a reason to stay

9
	Perrotto, which is a question mark for me.
	9
	late.

10
	THE COURT: And we'll talk about that
	10
	MR. COFER: There is a witness gone. See

11
	issue if there's any issues on that.
	11
	what 1 did?

12
	MR. GDANSKI: And there's another family
	12
	THE COURT: So we've got Prochaska gone

13
	member who we may or may not call.
	13
	and Cox gone.

14
	THE COURT: So no Dr. Prochaska.
	14
	So here's what 1 need of counsel. 1 need

15
	MR. GDANSKI: We don't have to do
	15
	counsel to please email me the designations,

16
	Dr. Prochaska.
	16
	and 1 will be happy to look at it. So what

17
	THE COURT: Prochaska is off the list.
	17
	we'll do is we'll just go ahead and address

18
	Okay. Yes.
	18
	that and be ready to go on Monday with the

19
	MR. COFER: 1 just want to respond kind of
	19
	designations.

20
	generally. And 1 understand Your Honor did say
	20
	MR. GDANSKI: Thank you.

21
	we could spill over a little bit.
	21
	Anything else to address?

22
	THE COURT: 1 would prefer not to because
	22
	MS. SCHAEFER: We did receive some

23
	lawyers are going to be very unhappy with me,
	23
	additional documents.

24
	including Mr. Bass's partner. 1 gave him an
	24
	THE COURT: More in-camera? More

25
	injunction hearing on the 20th, so...
	25
	in-camera. Okay. That's fine.


	Page   2038
	
	Page   2040

1
	MR. COFER: But even backing up, when it
	1
	MS. SCHAEFER: More showed up. So 1 will

2
	was clear we couldn't start October 3rd, Your
	2
	hand them over to Your Honor.

3
	Honor moved heaven and earth to make the three
	3
	THE COURT: Okay.

4
	weeks available, and you told everyone exactly
	4
	MR. CHESIN: Judge, another issue, could

5
	what that window was. And 1 told Your Honor 1
	5
	we talk a little bit about this issue that came

6
	had a prepaid, out-of-the-country vacation.
	6
	up during the examination about the current day

7
	THE COURT: 1 understand. And 1 gave
	7
	website and the ingredients?

8
	Mr. Scarola an injunction hearing in a very
	8
	1 know counsel is talking.

9
	major case with Mr. Ricci, so he's going to
	9
	THE COURT: 1 don't remember it, and Mr.

10
	have to deal with Mr. Bass on that, so...
	10
	Gdanski, 1 would remember that if it came in

11
	MR. COFER: My point is to the extent that
	11
	Cohen. Does someone remember if it came in in

12
	counsel is saying, oh, we can kind of slide a
	12
	Cohen? The current day ingredients.

13
	little bit, you know, 1 understand that it may
	13
	The current day ingredients, did that come

14
	take a little more time. The idea is, these
	14
	in in Cohen?

15
	guys ought to plan on being done.
	15
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 had a bunch of trials

16
	Today we had multiple questions that were
	16
	since Cohen and 1 have used them in all, so

17
	asked and answered, we had things slowed down
	17
	they're all blended together.

18
	because we didn't have the exhibits and stuff
	18
	THE COURT: 1 know they are, but -

19
	lined up, and we do need to be efficient, we do
	19
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 can't imagine that 1

20
	need to try to finish on the 20th, right?
	20
	didn't because it's just awesomely cool.

21
	MR. GDANSKI: We would love to, but 1
	21
	THE COURT: Okay. But 1 would awesomely

22
	think 1 flew. 1 covered a tremendous amount of
	22
	remember and 1 don't for some reason.

23
	material.
	23
	MR. CHESIN: 1 want to make sure that our

24
	THE COURT: You did - you did a good job.
	24
	objection is clear on what it is.

25
	Certainly we could always make it smoother and

	MR. CHESIN: Mr. Gdanski gave us the
	i
	going to talk this weekend, so...

2
	slides. We knew they were planning to show
	2
	MR. GDANSKI: But they're all coming in

3
	portions of the website. Our objection is not
	3
	saying, wow, we have all this big issue with

4
	to showing the website.
	4
	that document. What do they - it's not like

5
	THE COURT: 1 know. We've had that issue
	5
	it slipped in; it is literally a seven-page

6
	before, so...
	6
	document with a list of ingredients.

7
	MR. CHESIN: Depending on what questions
	7
	Before 1 even say what it goes to, it

8
	you ask, the website may or may not be
	8
	obviously says what it says, what it's going to

9
	relevant. If the questions are: Today can you
	9
	be used to demonstrate what it says.

10
	find out what the ingredients are 20 years ago?
	10
	There was no, you know, nothing hidden on

11
	Could you? That's fair game.
	11
	its face. When they saw it, someone should

12
	Our objection is to the questions that
	12
	have said: Hey, this guy wants to show the

13
	say: Does Philip Morris, today, still use
	13
	jury the list of ingredients on 10/30/2014.

14
	menthol? Do they still use ammonia? Do they
	14
	THE COURT: And I would have certainly

15
	still try to make cigarettes more addictive?
	15
	ruled on any objections.

16
	That is not at all relevant to this case.

	MR. GDANSKI: Do you have a problem with

17
	Mr. Perrotto died in 1996, nothing the
	17
	that.

18
	companies are doing today hurt him.
	18
	Instead, now they come back afterwards,

19
	To the extent we're talking about punitive
	19
	and it makes me look like, A, I did something

20
	damages, this is very different from the Waxman
	20
	in a slippery and a surreptitious way, which I

21
	hearings. The only punitive damages claim in
	21
	object to.

22
	this case is about a failure to provide
	22
	But this is why - and for the other ones,

23
	information. There is no design claim that has
	23
	that ones that didn't have the documents and it

24
	to do with punitive damages. The fact that the
	24
	was confusing, I recognize the confusion, but

25
	companies are still selling cigarettes, the
	25
	for this there's no indication of any confusion


	Page   2042
	
	Page   2044

1
	fact that they're still selling cigarettes that
	1
	or issue, so how come nobody said anything?

2
	are dangerous, the fact that they're selling
	2
	THE COURT: No, they should have. And

3
	cigarettes that are addictive, is not relevant
	3
	that's why I'm requiring them this weekend to

4
	to anything in either phase. So we object to
	4
	identify and follow the 48-hour rule and state

5
	the questions, not to the document.
	5
	any objection so we can deal with them

6
	THE COURT: Let me just ask you, what -
	6
	beforehand.

7
	MR. GDANSKI: I object to their objection.
	7
	MR. GDANSKI: It goes to showing what

8
	THE COURT: Okay. But what issue does it
	8
	Philip Morris continues to put in cigarettes.

9
	goto?
	9
	I will make it super crystal clear that that is

10
	MR. GDANSKI: I'll answer that but let me
	10
	a list from today. I'm not pretending ~

11
	say one other thing first.
	11
	THE COURT: Let me ask just you: What's

12
	THE COURT: Of course.
	12
	the legal ~ what's the relevance of that

13
	MR. GDANSKI: This is why - there is no
	13
	today?

14
	claim in this courtroom right now that I did
	14
	MR. GDANSKI: The relevance is the

15
	not give them that list of ingredients. And
	15
	continuing use of the chemicals and additives

16
	all that list of ingredients is exactly what it
	16
	in cigarettes, which have historically been

17
	is, a list of ingredients from the date 10/30.
	17
	used to manipulate nicotine, increase the

18
	It's not yesterday, it's -
	18
	potency of addiction, cause and sustain

19
	THE COURT: But so what? What does it go
	19
	addiction and cause cancer.

20
	to?
	20
	THE COURT: But it's fully disclosed, it's

21
	MR. GDANSKI:  My only point is this: What
	21
	on the website, how does that go to any

22
	did they think I was going to do with it? I
	22
	conspiracy claim, any misrepresentation claim,

23
	was going to show it. And they never said a
	23
	any of that stuff?

24
	word beforehand.
	24
	MR. GDANSKI: The conspiracy claim is

25
	THE COURT: Well, that's why you guys are
	25
	that ~ the conspiracy claim before goes to two

1
	different issues. Number one is that it was
	i
	Nick Perrotto is to contrast the evidence he

2
	never there for Nick Perrotto.
	2
	had available with the evidence that he didn't

3
	THE COURT: And 1 understand. That's a
	3
	have available.

4
	separate issue. That's a separate issue.
	4
	And, maybe, there are some people today --

5
	MR. GDANSKI: So how am 1 going to
	5
	because someone asked this in voir dire. You

6
	demonstrate the availability and the difference
	6
	know, who thinks we should be punished or

7
	of availability of information of what was
	7
	whatever for not putting all the ingredients

8
	available to Nick Perrotto versus what isn't
	8
	out of cigarettes on the side of the packets?

9
	available to Nick Perrotto other than showing
	9
	Someone asked that question.

10
	what is available today after he died and was
	10
	So there's clearly a difference on the

11
	actually available to him. 1 can't do that.
	11
	availability of information today for smokers

12
	Plus, 1 don't have - if they want to give
	12
	versus the availability of information

13
	me over the weekend, Philip Morris wants to
	13
	previously.

14
	send me the blend recipe, 1 will take that.
	14
	And Philip Morris says: Come to our

15
	THE COURT:  I'm sure they'll do that.
	15
	website and learn about the stuff. Come to our

16
	So...
	16
	the website and learn about the product.

17
	MR. GDANSKI: Send me the blend recipe
	17
	They never told Nick Perrotto that. They

18
	and -
	18
	never said: Come and learn about what we're

19
	THE COURT: That and the Coke secret,
	19
	going to tell you about the product.

20
	right?
	20
	So 1 think 1 am allowed to say, that 2000

21
	MR. COFER:  I've got it right here.
	21
	and whenever they put on their website, they

22
	THE COURT: That and the recipe for Coke,
	22
	told everybody X, they told all these people

23
	right?
	23
	these things. They're being open about it.

24
	MR. GDANSKI: Under a confidentiality
	24
	Okay, they say there's menthol in cigarettes.

25
	order, it's been done in other cases, send me
	25
	1 can point out that they don't admit the


	Page   2046
	
	Page   2048

1
	the blend recipe for the Merits that he smoked.
	1
	negative consequences of menthol. They're

2
	I'll use that. You know why?
	2
	being open about it. They say there's ammonia

3
	THE COURT: But let me just ask you, the
	3
	hydroxide, 1 can still point out the negative

4
	issue is they had ammonia back then. We
	4
	consequences.

5
	understand that. That's come in already. Why
	5
	But at least they're telling people

6
	is it relevant now that it still has ammonia
	6
	there's high-fructose corn syrup, there's

7
	today? That's my question.
	7
	cocoa, there's carob, whatever. All that stuff

8
	MR. GDANSKI: Because these guys say that
	8
	that's addressed.

9
	they've changed in this phase, this is the
	9
	They never afforded Nick Perrotto the

10
	phase where there's entitlement of punitive
	10
	opportunity to make a fully informed decision

11
	damages. Reprehensibility of conduct is
	11
	with that knowledge base. That's how it's

12
	exactly square on the issue here.
	12
	relevant. It goes directly to contrast and the

13
	THE COURT: But they're fully disclosing
	13
	information that he had, that they could have

14
	they have ammonia today, how is that
	14
	very easily made available to him that they had

15
	reprehensible conduct on their part?
	15
	in their knowledge base, which they didn't,

16
	MR. GDANSKI: They never said that ammonia
	16
	that they now do make available to smokers.

17
	does the slightest bit of thing. It's listed
	17
	THE COURT: Rebuttal, please.

18
	there as a flavorant. They never said that
	18
	MR. CHESIN: We don't object to the list

19
	menthol increases nicotine addiction or use
	19
	of ingredients. We don't object to the

20
	smoking. None of things have they ever done.
	20
	website. We don't object to the website. If

21
	It goes to all those issues.
	21
	we get to a Phase 2, it is possible we will put

22
	The jury can decide whether this would
	22
	up things from our website. The questions that

23
	have made a difference in Nick Perrotto. The
	23
	we objected to were questions about: Does

24
	only way for me, plaintiff, to get through the
	24
	Philip Morris still use menthol? Does Philip

25
	evidence that would have made a difference to
	25
	Morris still use ammonia? Does Philip Morris

1
	still try to manipulate the addictiveness of
	i
	about are things without a difference.

2
	cigarettes? That line of questioning is what's
	2
	Ammonia is in cigarettes today; ammonia

3
	irrelevant.
	3
	was in cigarettes when he smoked. Dr. Hurt

4
	And this is why and to answer Mr.
	4
	testified that ammonia increases nicotine

5
	Gdanski's question about why we didn't raise an
	5
	uptake and speed to the brain. You think that

6
	objection to the document, what did we think he
	6
	that chemical stopped doing it after

7
	was going to do with it. We have no problem
	7
	Mr. Perrotto died? We're really talking about

8
	with him saying, today the companies disclose
	8
	a super unbelievably subtle distinction of a

9
	all the ingredients but yesterday they didn't.
	9
	difference.

10
	You know, when Mr. Perrotto was alive, he had
	10
	Plus, our memo on Williams and State Farm

11
	no opportunity to know about the ingredients.
	11
	specifically addresses two concepts. Harm to

12
	We do object to any line of questioning
	12
	others can uniquely be considered in this case,

13
	and certainly any argument to the jury,
	13
	an entitlement phase. In this phase, the

14
	invitation to the jury to consider as relevant
	14
	entitlement phase.

15
	the fact that today Philip Morris or any of the
	15
	If Nick Perrotto was harmed by the

16
	companies, designed their cigarettes in a
	16
	manipulation of nicotine through the use of

17
	matter that the witness or Mr. Gdanski thinks
	17
	ammonia, which we just put testimony in that he

18
	makes them more dangerous, makes them more
	18
	was. And if Nick Perrotto was harmed through

19
	addictive, because there's no claim in this
	19
	the inclusion of menthol in cigarettes, which

20
	case, either compensatory or punitive, that has
	20
	we just put testimony in that he was, then the

21
	to do with the design of cigarettes today and
	21
	State Farm/Williams case that says that harm to

22
	the dangers of cigarettes today.
	22
	others is relevant in this case clearly

23
	THE COURT: You're not going there, right?
	23
	dictates the ongoing course of that type of

24
	MR. GDANSKI: 1 mean, 1 don't know where
	24
	conduct comes in this phase.

25
	I'm going, and I'm going home soon, with the
	25
	THE COURT: But 1 don't see how -


	Page   2050
	
	Page   2052

1
	Court's permission, but very simply, the memo
	1
	MR. CHESIN: But what Mr. Gdanski is

2
	that we filed with the Court regarding the
	2
	ignoring is the Soffer case. There's a

3
	State Farm versus Williams issue, it just
	3
	punitive damages claim in this case. There are

4
	addresses the issues super square on. Harm to
	4
	compensatory damages claims, strict liability,

5
	others is uniquely to be considered in this
	5
	negligence for fraud, for conspiracy. All this

6
	phase of the trial. This is the phase -
	6
	stuff about these cigarettes were more

7
	THE COURT: But I'm not understanding the
	7
	dangerous than they had to be, that's relevant

8
	link to harm to others --
	8
	to the strict liability claim. The only claim

9
	MR. GDANSKI: Because Nick Perrotto smoked
	9
	on which Mr. Gdanski has a punitive damages

10
	menthol cigarettes. So there is people still --
	10
	claim, is fraud, failure to provide

11
	THE COURT: But where is the harm to
	11
	information.

12
	others based upon what they are or are not
	12
	THE COURT: Correct. It is not on the

13
	telling people in the website today? That's
	13
	design issue. That's what you're talking

14
	what I'm not understanding.
	14
	about. It's a design issue and there's no

15
	MR. GDANSKI: There's no issue with the
	15
	claim for punitives on design.

16
	website now. Now the issue seems to be me
	16
	MR. GDANSKI: This is not, because this is

17
	asking questions about what currently
	17
	not a design issue. Cigarettes are designed in

18
	cigarettes contain, whether or not these are
	18
	such a way as to improperly inform smokers

19
	problematic.
	19
	about the addictive properties of nicotine.

20
	You know, listen, menthol increased
	20
	That's - 1 mean -

21
	nicotine addiction and youth initiation back
	21
	THE COURT: What we just spent time

22
	when Nick was smoking and now. It's not like
	22
	talking about was adding ammonia, adding

23
	that science -- it's not like that molecular
	23
	menthol. That is a design issue.

24
	scientific thing only started to occur after
	24
	MR. GDANSKI: Sure. That's all design and

25
	Nick Perrotto died. What we're really talking
	25
	it also goes to customers not knowing about the

	counsel to please put the motion in writing and

2
	finding in this case.
	2
	1 will address anything in writing as well.

3
	THE COURT: But that has nothing to do
	3
	Anything else that we need to address?

	with design. I'm going to sustain defendant's

	Are we okay with the deposition of Michael

5
	objection.
	5
	Perrotto? All set?

	MS. SCHAEFER: We don't have it set yet,

7
	objection is.
	7
	but we are looking to set it potentially on

8
	THE COURT: State your objection
	8
	Tuesday is our hope.

9
	specifically so he understands.

	THE COURT: Okay. That's all right.

	MR. WEAVER: Your Honor, with the Court's

11
	various questions, and 1 can find the
	11
	permission, 1 am going to confer with counsel,

	12
	I'll send Michele an email tonight laying out a

15
	add that, does the company still manipulate the

	cigarettes to make them more addictive. We
	16
	Thank you everyone. All right. Have a nice

	move to strike the questions and the answers.

18
	And we'll probably - 1 will send you something

19
	over the weekend, but we'll probably -
	19
	

20
	THE COURT: Just write the written motion

21
	and then you can tell me the response. How's
	21
	

22
	that?

23
	MR. GDANSKI: This testimony came in in

2              (Continued from Volume 14.)

3             (The following proceedings were held out

4       of the presence of the jury:)

5             THE COURT: Is everybody ready?

6              Good morning, everyone. Is everybody

7       ready?

8              COUNSEL: Good morning.

9             THE COURT: Good morning, everyone. 10             All right. All our jurors are here;

n       they're back there, drinking coffee, and happy

12       as - happy as can be.

13              Mr. Gdanski, are you ready to proceed?

14              MR. GDANSKI: I am, yes, Judge.

15             THE COURT: Okay. And Dr. Hurt is here

16       somewhere?

17              MR. GDANSKI: He is here somewhere.

18             THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Cofer.

19              MR. COFER: I think there may be a couple 2 0       of documents that we need to -

21             THE COURT: Sure, of course.

2 2              MR. COFER: - take up.

23             THE COURT: Of course.

2 4              MR. CHESIN: A handful of things that we

2 5       wanted to discuss before Dr. Hurt -

Page   206

1             THE COURT: Sure. That's perfectly fine.

2              MR. CHESIN: - he gets back on the

3       stand.

4             THE COURT: Of course.

5              MR. CHESIN: First, we filed a motion

6       yesterday evening relating to the testimony

7       that came in on Friday about modern-day

8       ingredients.

9             THE COURT: Okay.

10              MR. CHESIN: I don't know if Your

li       Honor-

12             THE COURT: I didn't receive -

13              Let me give you guys my e-mail address.

14       Sometimes things get lost in the clerk's

15       office. Just e-mail everything directly to me.

16              MR. CHESIN: Sure.

17             THE COURT: So that would be easier, I

18       can make sure I get it. It's

19       msasser@pbcgov.org. So just feel free to 2 0       e-mail me any motions directly.

21              MR. CHESIN: We'll do that in the future.

22             THE COURT: Okay.

23              MR. CHESIN: May I approach?

24             THE COURT: Sure. Let me take a look at 2 5       it.

Page   2063

1             All right. Thank you. Give me just one

2       moment. I'm sorry, I didn't get a chance to

3       read this.

4             MR. CHESIN: Sure.

5             MR. GDANSKI: For what it's worth - I

6       know Your Honor's reading it -

7             THE COURT: I'm reading it real quick to

8       save time, yeah.

9             MR. GDANSKI: - we would just as soon

1 o       not argue that now, and deal with whatever

11       evidentiary issues there are regarding

12       exhibits, so I can get this doctor rocking and

13       rolling, get the jury on its way -

14             THE COURT: Let me make sure we - so we

15       can go ahead -

16             You're not going to get - address any

17       further issues on this point, at this point in

18       time, with Dr. Hurt?

19             MR. GDANSKI: Well -

2 0             THE COURT: The ingredients, are you

21       moving off that topic?

22             MR. GDANSKI: I'm moving off the topic, 2 3       absolutely, right now, yes; but I will tell you

2 4       this much, to be perfectly candid with the

2 5       Court: If Your Honor is going to entertain

Page   2064

1       that motion and grant it, I'm going to fix

2       whatever issue the granting of that motion

3       might create in the minds of the jury.

4             THE COURT: Okay.

5             MR. GDANSKI: So, you know, buyer beware.

6             MR. CHESIN: I'm not quite sure what fix

7       Mr. Gdanski has in mind.

8             THE COURT: Okay.

9             MR. CHESIN: The fix that we propose -

10             THE COURT: Is a curative.

11             MR. CHESIN: --is a curative

12       instruction -

13             THE COURT: Okay.

14             MR. CHESIN: --which I do think would be

15       appropriate to do now.

16             THE COURT: Do you object to the curative

17       now, or do you want - do you want to do - or

18       do you want to argue this now?

19             MR. GDANSKI: We do object to the 2 0       curative now, yes. We object to -

21             THE COURT: Okay. Well, let me do this,

2 2       then: Let me read this, and then I'll

2 3       certainly be happy to consider the defendants'

2 4       requested curative and plaintiff's fix, or

2 5       whatever that is.

1              MR. CHESIN: Sure. That remains to be

2       seen.

3             THE COURT: Okay.

4              MR. CHESIN: Other than that, there's a

5       couple of evidentiary points; and I think

6       Lorillard may have a couple, as well.

7             THE COURT: Sure.

8              MR. CHESIN: Mine, I think, are simple.

9             We did receive, over the weekend, from

10       plaintiff, a list of documents that they plan

11       to use with Dr. Hurt this morning. There were

12       a handful.

13             THE COURT: Excellent.

14              MR. CHESIN: --1 wanted to discuss.

15              Exhibit 25M is a draft press release that

16       was offered and excluded in the Tullo case. We

17       ask for the same ruling. I can tell you what

18       it is.

19             THE COURT: Why don't you tell me,

2 0       because I don't remember, four years ago, one

21       document.

22              MR. GDANSKI: By PT number, no less.

23             THE COURT: I don't remember that.

24              MR. CHESIN: That's what I figured. 2 5             There was a press release that the

Page   2066

1       Tobacco Institute issued following the issuance

2       of the 1988 Surgeon General's report,

3       disagreeing with the conclusions of the report.

4              Prior to that press release being issued,

5       apparently there was a draft of it that was

6       written by someone at Philip Morris. There's a

7       copy of that draft with some handwritten

8       notations. The draft was never - never -

9              It contains a lot of language that never

1 o       made it into the final press release. It was

11       never publicized, it wasn't a public document.

12       We have authenticity objections and a whole

13       bunch of others. You granted that in Tullo.

14             THE COURT: Response, Mr. Gdanski.

15              MR. GDANSKI: It comes from their files.

16       It's their internal documents. A lot of the

17       internal documents weren't released and made

18       public. We'll just clarify that point. We'll

19       make it clear this was not ever issued as a

2 o       press release, but it was their internal

21       statement regarding the '88 Surgeon General's

2 2       report.

2 3             THE COURT: Rebuttal.

2 4              MR. CHESIN: As a result of it not being

2 5       issued, it is - no one ever saw it.

Page   2067

1             THE COURT: How could anybody rely on it

2       if it wasn't released?

3              MR. GDANSKI: Well, there's a tremendous

4       amount of evidence that's -

5             THE COURT: No, no. No, I understand;

6       but, in this situation, this is post - this

7       is-

8             What Surgeon General's report is it?

9              MR. GDANSKI: '88.

10             THE COURT: '88?

11              MR. GDANSKI:  Right.

12             THE COURT: Well, how could the plaintiff

13       have potentially relied on it at that point in

14       time with a press release that wasn't released,

15       wasn't released maybe -

16              MR. GDANSKI: There's an omission. So

17       they're taking the public position -

18              It goes to the tobacco companies'

19       internal positions on nicotine addiction and

2 0       their internal position on the Surgeon General

21       being wrong-headed.

22              MR. CHESIN: The press release that was 2 3       issued disputes the conclusions of the '88

2 4       Surgeon General's reports. We have objections

2 5       to those. We filed them in writing, you

Page   2068

1       overruled them -

2             THE COURT: Yes.

3              MR. CHESIN: - in the prior cases; and I

4       think in this one what we object to is the

5       internal draft that contains some inflammatory

6       language.

7             There is no allegation in this case that

8       we were hiding from the public our internal

9       thinking about what our press releases should 10       be.

n             THE COURT: I'll sustain defendants'

12       objection. I'll be consistent with Tullo.

13              MR. CHESIN: Thank you, Judge.

14             THE COURT: Anything else for PM?

15              MR. CHESIN: The only one-the only

16       other one that I had was just to clarify with

17       plaintiff, 2184 is that document that says

18       "Shook Hardy reminds us."

19              MR. GDANSKI: I will notsaythat.

2 0              MR. CHESIN: I assumed. I just wanted to

21       make sure on the record it's going to be

2 2       redacted before it goes back or it's shown to

2 3       the jury.

2 4             MR. GDANSKI: Yes.

25              MR. CHESIN: So that is all I have. I

1       know Lorillard -

2             THE COURT: Lorillard, yes.

3             And I do have the last set of medical

4       records, which I did the in-camera. I'm going

5       to go ahead and turn those over to you,

6       Ms. Schaefer, as well.

10             MR. GDANSKI: This is your set?

11             THE COURT: I presume -

12             Yes.

13             MR. GDANSKI: Thank you.

14             THE COURT: I presume this is the last

15       set of medical records.

16             MS. SCHAEFER: Well, we do have that one

17       last order that went out, and so there may be a

18       bit more, and we have not yet heard back on a

19       potential date for the deposition.

2 0             MR. GDANSKI: We're going to try to make

21       him available tomorrow afternoon.

2 2             MS. SCHAEFER: Tomorrow afternoon? That

2 3       would be great. If you could let us know a

2 4       time, so we can set up a court reporter.

2 5    MR. GDANSKI: Yes.

10             MR. GDANSKI: This is your set?

11             THE COURT: I presume -

12             Yes.

13             MR. GDANSKI: Thank you.

14             THE COURT: I presume this is the last

15       set of medical records.

16             MS. SCHAEFER: Well, we do have that one

17       last order that went out, and so there may be a

18       bit more, and we have not yet heard back on a

19       potential date for the deposition.

2 0             MR. GDANSKI: We're going to try to make

21       him available tomorrow afternoon.

2 2             MS. SCHAEFER: Tomorrow afternoon? That

2 3       would be great. If you could let us know a

2 4       time, so we can set up a court reporter.

2 5             MR. GDANSKI: Yes.

Page   2070

1             MS. SCHAEFER: Thank you.

2             Okay. I'm covering just a few documents,

3       the first of which is PT02391, which was

4       actually disclosed to us for the first time

5       yesterday.

6             And our objection to this is relevance

7       and 403. And here's why. The document is

8       actually a report from Dr. Hammond and

9       Dr. Auerbach, regarding a study they did on -

10       where dogs were smoking. It killed the dogs.

11       This wasn't the tobacco industry doing this.

12             Honestly, it's from 1970. These folks

13       were with the American Cancer Society, and this

14       is a report of their findings from this

15       experiment where, basically, they put trachs in

16       dogs' throats, had them smoke, and then killed

17       them.

18             The inflammatory nature of this document

19       clearly outweighs any relevance because, number 2 o       one, this is a report of -- or an experiment

21       done by the Cancer Society, not the defendants.

2 2             Number two, it really is just

2 3       inflammatory.

2 4             THE COURT: Mr. Gdanski.

2 5             MR. GDANSKI: Can I see the document?

Page   2071

1              MS. SCHAEFER: Sure. It's the one that

2       came in late yesterday. It might have been a

3       typo.

4              MR. GDANSKI: It must have been.

5             THE COURT: You don't want to go to the

6       dog issue, right?

7              MR. GDANSKI: Not right now. Let's just

8       table that.

9              MS. SCHAEFER: Okay. Thank you.

10             THE COURT: All right. Next?

11              MS. SCHAEFER: Okay. Next is a series of

12       public health community - public health

13       documents. And the first one -

14              I'm actually going to hand up a copy to

15       Your Honor -

16             THE COURT: Sure, let me take a look.

17              MS. SCHAEFER: --if you don't mind.

18              It's a public policy statement on

19       nicotine addiction and tobacco, which is 2 0       PT5455.

21             THE COURT: Let me take a look.

22              MS. SCHAEFER: And, Your Honor, the

2 3       reason we actually have a problem with this is

2 4       particularly because it is a public policy

2 5       statement.

Page   2072

1              If you get into the latter pages, what

2       you have is a series of recommendations for

3       changed legislation, litigation, and different

4       regulation than what we currently have.

5              So not only is this document a problem in

6       terms of preemption -

7              MR. GDANSKI: I'm not using it right now.

8              THE COURT: He's not using it. Okay.

9       There we go.

10              MS. SCHAEFER: All right. Problem

n       solved.

12              THE COURT: Two for two. Okay.

13              MS. SCHAEFER: All righty.

14              And then the last three we can probably

15       handle in a group. And that is - it's 5446,

16       5447 -

17              Actually, there's four. 5446 is just a

18       one-page printout of the CDC's position on

19       nicotine addiction. It's really just

2 o       repetitive of everything the doctor's been

21       testifying about for the last two days. At

22       this point, it's cumulative, it's hearsay.

2 3              THE COURT: Is that a current CDC

2 4       position?

25              MS. SCHAEFER: It's a printout from

2             THE COURT: Okay.

3             MR. GDANSKI: What's wrong with that?

4             THE COURT: Objection's overruled.

5             MS. SCHAEFER: Well --

6             And just, Your Honor, I think our primary

7       objection is going to be to the extent that the

8       doctor attempts to use the position of the CDC

9       or another public health - public health

1 o       entity to bolster his opinions, we're going to

11       have a bolstering objection on this.

12             THE COURT: And you're certainly welcome

13       to make it; and I'm sure Mr. Gdanski is going

14       to say, and are you going to say the CDC agrees

15       with you?

16             Or I don't know what you're going to do.

17             MS. SCHAEFER: Yeah.

18             MR. GDANSKI: Something like that.

19             Quite frankly, I would just like to - I

2 0       would like to introduce these right now, all of

21       these documents, en masse, and this way I don't

2 2       necessarily have to use each one with Dr. Hurt

2 3       and I can speed things up this morning. 2 4             We're not behind schedule, but I just

2 5       want to move it along; and if I can get the

4             THE COURT: Objection's overruled.

5             MS. SCHAEFER: Well --

6             And just, Your Honor, I think our primary

2             THE COURT: Well, I'm intra --

3             I'm overruling defendants' cumulative

4       objection -

5             MR. GDANSKI: Okay.

6             THE COURT: --as to the CDC documents.

7             MR. GDANSKI: Okay.

8             THE COURT: So-

9             That's fine. And you can -

10             If there's any other objections, they can

11       raise contemporaneous objections.

12             MS. SCHAEFER: Yeah, we have filed

13       written objections to these, the typical

14       hearsay objections - that's what I'm saying -

15             THE COURT: Okay.

16             MS. SCHAEFER: -- and we understand Your

17       Honor's prior rulings relating to that. So

18       thank you.

19             THE COURT: All right. Yes, Mr. Maguire. 2 0       Yes, uh-huh.

21             MR. MAGUIRE: One more.

22             THE COURT: Sure.

2 3             MR. MAGUIRE: And that's Plaintiff's

2 4       PT04200.

2 5             THE COURT: Okay.

Page   2075

1             MR. MAGUIRE: And it is a Consumer Guide

2       for the Surgeon General's -

3             THE COURT: Okay.

4            MR. GDANSKI: I'm notgoingtouseit.

5             MR. MAGUIRE: Type of brochure.

6             THE COURT: He's not going to use it.

7             MR. MAGUIRE: He says he's not -

8      we've -

9             Let me just state -

10             THE COURT: Sure.

11             MR. MAGUIRE: --just generally, Your

12       Honor, we did have argument on Surgeon

13       Generals' reports the other day, and

14       Mr. Gdanski raised the adoptive admission in

15       opposition. I don't think he's actually

16       briefed that, but we didn't actually have the

17       opportunity to put any paper on that.

18             Since then, we actually have looked to

19       see if any court has allowed in any of these

2 o       reports in toto, as an adoptive admission, and

21       our conclusion so far is -

22             THE COURT: Nobody has?

23             MR. MAGUIRE: -- we've found none. 2 4             So we would like to give Your Honor -

25             THE COURT: You're welcome to brief the

Page   2076

1       issue. That's fine.

2             MR. MAGUIRE: --some briefing on that.

3             THE COURT: Okay.

4             MR. MAGUIRE: I know that the--in

5       Gafney, Judge Blanc allowed in certain sections

6       under a theory of adoptive admission -

7             THE COURT: Okay.

8             MR. MAGUIRE: --but we would like to

9      give -

10             THE COURT: Sure, that's fine.

11             MR. MAGUIRE: - you some papers on that.

12       So we'll hopefully file that today.

13             THE COURT: Okay. But, Mr. Gdanski, are

14       you going to be using this - this - I

15       guess -

16             What is it, a compendium, or is it -

17             MR. GDANSKI: I'm not using the consumer

18       guide today.

19             THE COURT: Consumer guide.

20             MR. GDANSKI: Having said that, the

21       Surgeon Generals'reports are in. Your Honor's 2 2       ruled. I would object to the continued

2 3       statements that we haven't had, A, an

2 4       opportunity to brief stuff, because you guys

2 5       have had tremendous opportunity to brief a

1       million different issues beforehand; and, B,

2       any rearguing of that issue.

3             THE COURT: That's fine. They're welcome

4       to brief whatever they want to, and I'm happy

5       to consider it.

6              MR. GDANSKI: Of course.

7             THE COURT: So-

8              Okay. That's fine.

9              MR. MAGUIRE: So he's not using this

10       today?

11              MR. GDANSKI: I'm not using the consumer

12       guide. I mean, unless on redirect you all open

13       up some issue with that. Not on my direct.

14             THE COURT: Thank you, Mr. Gdanski.

15              MR. GDANSKI: Judge, what I would like to

16       do, even though it will take three or four

17       minutes right now, is just to read in the

18       documents into evidence, that come in. They

19       can say, you know, all objections are made, 2 0       preserved, whatever. Your Honor can say 21       they're admitted. And this way, when I'm with 2 2       Dr. Hurt, if I skip a document -

23             THE COURT: That's fine.

2 4              MR. GDANSKI: -- it's still in evidence.

2 5             THE COURT: That's fine. And that will

Page   2078

1       be helpful for the clerk, as well. She would

2       appreciate that.

3              MR. GDANSKI: Okay. So-

4              MR. WEAVER: It - Your Honor -

5              I'm sorry, Your Honor. If he skips a

6       document, it's still in evidence?

7             THE COURT: No, no, no. No, you need to

8       go ahead and lay the --

9             You need to specifically delineate it

10       with Dr. Hurt, so -- as well. You can't just

11       move them in and not reference them with

12       Dr. Hurt, too, so -

13              MR. GDANSKI: Okay. But-

14              I don't mean to ask the Court a question,

15       but I'm going to. Why not?

16             THE COURT: Well, are you--how many

17       documents are you moving in evidence now?

18              MR. GDANSKI: Fifteen.

19             THE COURT: Fifteen?

2 0              MR. GDANSKI: In other words -

21             THE COURT: Are there any objections?

22              MR. GDANSKI: These are all the ones that 2 3       we've gone over and we sent them.

2 4       Traditionally, we don't have to use every

2 5       document with the witness in order to introduce

Page   2079

1       it into evidence.

2             THE COURT: I don't know if they're

3       objecting. I don't know if they're objecting.

4       If they're objecting, technically --

5              MR. GDANSKI: It's going to take

6       longer --

7             MR. COFER: I think we're standing on our

8       written objections.

9             THE COURT: Okay.

10              MR. COFER: I mean, if there is a

11       specific document that has another objection,

12       we'll raise it.

13             THE COURT: Okay. That's fine.

14             So, for the record, the written

15       objections have been overruled.

16              MR. COFER: Yes.

17             THE COURT: Okay.

18              MR. GDANSKI: So then is there a

19       procedural objection to what I'm about to do? 2 0              MR. COFER: No.

21              MR. GDANSKI: Okay.

22             THE COURT: Okay. There we go.

2 3             Just read the numbers into the record,

2 4       please, Mr. Gdanski.

25              MR. GDANSKI: I will, of course.

2       a two-digit number, which comes from the

3       slides, and some are going to be PTs.

4             THE COURT: Okay.

5             MR. GDANSKI: And Moni, in the back, will

6       keep track of everything I'm doing.

7             MR. COFER: Although, let me make sure I

8       understand. We're not objecting to the

9       documents. To the respect you have Dr. Hurt's

1 o       slides, call-outs, we do object to those.

11             MR. GDANSKI: I'm not putting in the

12       slides.

13             MR. COFER: Okay.

14             MR. GDANSKI: I'm doing documents.

15             MR. COFER: Okay. Thank you.

16             MR. GDANSKI: But I'm just going to call

 6             MR. WEAVER: Sorry, Your Honor, I have an
 7       objection. That was not disclosed on any of
 8       plaintiff's lists.
 9             THE COURT: Oh.
 10             MR. CHESIN: 1 think plaintiff - I'm
 11       sorry -
12             THE COURT: Yes.
 13             MR. CHESIN: 1 think Mr. Gdanski may have
 14       misspoken. 1 think it's 02391.
 15             THE COURT: Oh, okay. Thank you,
 16       Mr. Chesin.
 17             Can you confirm that, Mr. Gdanski?
 18             MR. GDANSKI: I meant 02391.
 19             MR. CHESIN: 2391 is what was sent to me. 2 0           THE COURT: You transposed the numbers? 21            MR. GDANSKI: Do you have another
 2 2      document?
 23             MR. CHESIN: Not from here.
 24             MR. GDANSKI: Okay. I'll do it later. 2 5      That's fine.

 1             MS. SCHAEFER: Oh. Your Honor, and just
 2      so it's clear for the record, occasionally we
 3      argued some of these documents by their PT
 4       numbers, and 1 think it's going to create some
 5      confusion on the record to have these Hurt demo
 6       numbers used instead of the PTs.
 7            THE COURT: We're going to need to
 8      substitute PT numbers because the clerk's -
9             1 mean, they're inconsistent -
10             MS. SCHAEFER: Yeah.
 11            THE COURT: - for the record.
 12             MR. WEAVER: And also, Your Honor, the
 13      copies of the demonstratives that we were
 14      served with do not have numbers on them.
 15            THE COURT: Oh, okay. So they don't know
 16      what you're referencing, then?
 17             MR. GDANSKI: No; they do.
 18             MR. COFER: Ithinktheydo.
 19             MR. GDANSKI: They do. 1 don't know 2 0     what's going on-
21           MS. SCHAEFER: They have numbers, but 2 2      certain of them don't have a corresponding PT 23      number.
 2 4           THE COURT: Okay. What we can do, maybe 2 5      during lunch, if you can pull the actual PT

 2       that one later.

 1       numbers that back up -
2             MR. GDANSKI: They don't all have PTs.
 3       Some of them are on there as Hurt numbers. So

 6       Exhibit A, B, C, D-
7            THE COURT: We're going to need
 8      something. 1 think Ms. Schaefer is correct,
 9      just so we have a clean record.
 10             MR. GDANSKI: We'll figure that part out.
 11      We'll straighten out all the clerical issues.

 13             MR. WEAVER: And, Your Honor, Mr. Gdanski
 14       read PT02810. That was not on the disclosed
 15       list.
 16             MR. GDANSKI: What is that?
 17            THE COURT: 810-2810.
 18             MR. GDANSKI: What did 1 say it was
 19      called, do you know?
 2 0           MR. WEAVER: 1 don't remember.
 21            MR. GDANSKI: 0280, you said?
 2 2           MR. WEAVER: 02810, is what 1 heard. If
 23      I'm wrong, I'm wrong. Sorry.
 2 4            MR. GDANSKI: I think it was 1820.
 2 5           MR. WEAVER: Okay. My bad.

 1              we've taken care of those; and Dr. Hurt will be

 3              will proceed with his direct examination.
 4                     MR. GDANSKI: Thank you.
 5                     THE COURT: Thank you.

 11                         RICHARD D. HURT, M.D.
 12               a witness, being previously duly sworn in the
 13       above-entitled cause, testified under oath as follows:
 14                    DIRECT EXAMINATION (continued)
 15       BY MR. GDANSKI:
 16              Q.   Good morning, Dr. Hurt.
 17              A.    Good morning.
 18              Q.   All right. So we're going to get right
 19       to it, okay?
 2 0             A.    Okay.
 21              Q.   As a medical doctor, did you review
 22       Mr. Perrotto's medical records? 2 3             A.    Idid.
 2 4            Q.   All right. And in reviewing the medical
 2 5     records, did you see that Mr. Perrotto was diagnosed
	Page   2088
 1              Q.   1 don't know exactly how it turned out,
 2       but 53 years old. At that point in time, had he
 3       smoked more than enough cigarettes manufactured by
 4       Reynolds, Lorillard and Philip Morris, to cause his
 5       lung cancer?
 6                    MR. WEAVER: Objection, vague.
 7                    THE COURT: Sustained.
 8              Q.   Dr. Hurt, is it clear as day that smoking
 9       cigarettes caused Mr. Perrotto's lung cancer? 10             A.    Yes.
 li            Q.   Okay. And do you see any evidence in the
 12       record that he smoked cigarettes made by companies
 13       that are not a party to this lawsuit, Reynolds,
 14       Lorillard, or Philip Morris?
 15              A.    Idid not.
 16              Q.   Okay. So here we see a medical record.
 17       And at the top, it's Nick Perrotto, from West Boca
 18       Medical Center here in Palm Beach. And the indication
 19       for the exam is chronic pain. 2 0             A.    Correct.
 21            Q.   Can you tell the jury a little bit about 2 2      the background, the type of pain Mr. Perrotto was 2 3      experiencing which led him to ultimately go to the 2 4      doctor? 2 5             A.    Yeah. He had right upper back pain that

1       was persistent and getting worse according to the

2       records.

3               Q.   And if we drop down, they did something

4       called a CT scan of the chest with contrast. Do you

5       see that?

6               A.    Correct.

7               Q.   Tell the jury, please, what is a CT scan

8       with contrast?

9               A.    Well, a CT scan is computed tomography,

10       so it gives us something more than just regular chest

11       x-rays do, because it gives us more detail.

12                      And, then, when you use any radiographic

13       sort of material, you can have better contrast with

14       something that takes up the contrast compared to the

15       regular tissue that does not.

16               Q.   So what's the difference between a CT

17       scan and an x-ray?

18               A.    Well, a CT scan is a very sophisticated

19       x-ray, basically. It takes multiple different slices. 2 0       So it's multiple different x-rays all in one.

21               Q.   And it says there's a seven-by-two

2 2       centimeter soft tissue mass in the posterior aspect of

2 3       the right upper lobe adjacent to the posterior chest

2 4       wall.

2 5                     What does that mean?

Page   2090

1               A.    Well, this is a mass, so it's -- and it's

2       very large, seven centimeters. Seven-by-two

3        centimeters would be a very large mass. And it looks

4        like it's right next to the back of the chest wall,

5       where he was having the pain.

6               Q.    And if you had to, you know, turn

7       seven-by-two centimeters into a dimension, into an

8        object, is it a golf ball? A baseball? About how big

9      is that?

10             A.    Oh, I don't know how -- how big a golf

ii      ball is. It would be a golf ball size, maybe a little

12        bit bigger.

13               Q.    Adjacent to the posterior chest wall,

14       what does that mean?

15                       (Cell phone interruption.)

16                      THE WITNESS: Oh, geez, I'm sorry.

17                      THE COURT: That's okay, Doctor. You're

18               fine.

19                      THE WITNESS: I'm sorry.

2 0                      THE COURT: That's okay. It happens.

21                      MR. GDANSKI: You got it?

22                      THE WITNESS: Thank you. Got it.

23        BY MR. GDANSKI:

2 4               Q.    Okay. So the question was, posterior

2 5       chest wall, where is that on the body?

Page   2091

1                A.    It's back here (indicating).

2                       So he had -- he had the right upper back

3        pain. So the posterior chest wall is in the back

4       side.

5               Q.    How does lung cancer cause right upper

6        back pain?

7                A.    Well, if it's in - it's right next to

8       the chest wall, it can be touching structures that

9       would cause the pain. The pleura, mainly.

10                       The pleura is very pain sensitive, sort

n        of a lot of nerves in the pleura. If you've ever had

12        pleurisy, those are the sorts of pain fibers that

13       would be affected by this.

14               Q.   What is the pleura?

15                A.    The pleura is the outer covering of the

16        lung and the inner covering of the chest wall. So

17        it's kind of contiguous.

18               Q.   And where is that pleura? Is it inside

19       the lung?

2 0                A.    It's -- it's on the outside of the lung

21        and on the inside of the chest wall. So it separates

2 2       the lung from the chest wall. So it's the outer

2 3        covering of the lung and the inner lining of the chest

2 4      wall.

2 5               Q.   After Mr. Perrotto ~

Page   2092

1                    After any patient has this kind of

2       finding, is this a scary finding?

3               A.    Oh, yes. It's ~ for his -

4                     With his history, it would warrant doing

5       further investigation.

6              Q.   So what's typically done after the

7       patient has a CT scan where they show a huge mass in

8       the chest?

9            A.    Well, you want to get some tissue to see 10      what it is.

ii              Q.   And is there -

12                    What does that mean? What's the process

13       by which you get tissue?

14               A.    Well, there's various ways you can do it.

15       You can put a needle through the chest wall and get a

16       small amount of tissue from a needle biopsy; or else

17       you can do bronchoscopy, where you put a tube down

18       into the bronchial tubes and look out into the area

19       and see if you can get tissue that way.

2 0                     Ultimately, sometimes, it requires

21       surgery to get a very large section of tissue.

22              Q.   Did you see that Mr. Perrotto had a

2 3       couple of different instances where the doctors went

2 4       in and tried to take out a little bit of fluid or a

2 5       little bit of tissue from the tumor?

 1               A.    They did a needle biopsy, to begin with,
 2       yes.
 3               Q.   So tell the jury, please, what a needle
 4       biopsy is.
 5               A.    A needle biopsy is --
6                      Well, they're bigger than a needle that
 7       you have your blood drawn from, but they're still
 8       relatively small. The internal diameter of the biopsy
 9       needle is relatively small.
 io                 So it's placed in through the chest wall
 11       into the area where the tumor is and, you know, they
 12       extract tissue that way.
 13               Q.   Okay. Sol think we're going to take a
 14       look at an anatomical demonstrative of just normal
 15       human lungs.
 16               A.    Okay.
 17                      MR. GDANSKI: You got that ready?
 18                      There it is.
 19               Q.   So what side was Mr. Perrotto's cancer
 20       on?
 21               A.    It was on the right side.
 2 2            Q.   Okay. And upper, middle? 2 3            A.    Upper.
 2 4            Q.   So around this area (indicating)? 2 5            A.    1 think so, yes.
	Page   2095
 1              A.    Yes.
 2              Q.   So what does that mean, just so the jury
 3       understands, for something to be primary lung cancer?
 4              A.    It means that it has its origin in the
 5       lung tissue, itself. It didn't come from someplace
 6       else.
 7              Q.   All right. After the diagnosis was made
 8       of lung cancer, did Mr. Perrotto have chemotherapy and
 9       radiation?
 10              A.    Well, not yet. He had the diagnosis
 11       established later on. He had ~
 12                    1 think he had a bronchoscopy at some
 13       point.
 14              Q.   Okay. What's a bronchoscopy?
 15              A.    Where you put a tube down into the chest,
 16       into the bronchial tubes, and look around to see if
 17       you can find the origins of the tumor.
 18              Q.   Okay. And were they able to find the
 19       origins of Mr. Perrotto's tumor? 2 0             A.    They did.
 21            Q.   All right. Let's take a look at a record
 2 2      from Good Samaritan Hospital.
 2 3                 You saw records from a doctor named Neal
 2 4      Rothschild?
 2 5             A.    Idid.

Page   2094
 1              Q.   Okay. And when you do a needle biopsy,
 2       are you taking out the entire tumor, or -
3                   You know, what are you taking out?
 4              A.    You're taking just a very small sliver of
 5       tissue.
 6              Q.   So when Mr. Perrotto had the needle
 7       biopsy done, what did - what happened?
 8              A.    Well, it showed carcinoma, which is --
9       which means that there was cancer there; but they
 1 o      really had a little trouble figuring out exactly what
 11       kind it was.
 12              Q.   Okay. And did you see that the -
13                    1 think Debbie, Debbie Perrotto, actually
 14       sent her husband's - the tissue from the fine-needle
 15       biopsy up to a pathologist in Virginia.
 16              A.    1 don't recall that, but...
 17              Q.   Okay. But did you see that multiple
 18       pathologists looked at the specimen from the needle
 19       biopsy?
 2 0             A.    That's correct.
 21            Q.   Okay. Now, after they looked at the
 2 2      specimens from the needle biopsy, was a diagnosis made
 2 3      of lung cancer?
 2 4            A.    Yes.
 2 5            Q.   Was this primary lung cancer?
	Page   2096
 1               Q.   Okay. And who is Dr. Rothschild?
 2               A.    He was one of his physicians. He had
 3       several. He was -
4                      1 can't remember if he was an oncologist
 5       or a chest physician. He was one of the main
 6       physicians he had during the course of his diagnosis
 7       and treatment.
 8               Q.   Okay. What is an oncologist?
 9               A.    An oncologist specializes in cancer. io           Q.   Let's take a look at Bates Number 22,
 11       please.
 12                      MR. COFER: What's the date of the
 13               record, Counsel?
 14                      MR. GDANSKI: Sure. It's a discharge
 15               summary from 10/8/92.
 16                      MR. COFER: 10/8/92?
 17                      MR. GDANSKI: Yes, 10/8/92.
 18                      MR. COFER: Thank you.
 19                      MR. GDANSKI: Not that one.
 2 0           Q.   Okay. Can you tell the jury, please,
 21     what "esophagitis" is, what that term means?
 2 2            A.    "Esophagitis" is irritation of the
 2 3     esophagus.
 2 4                 The esophagus is the food tube leading
 2 5     from the mouth to the stomach; and esophagitis can

11    (Pages   2097   to   2100)

Page   2097
 1      occur in the lower part of the esophagus. It's
 2      irritation or inflammation.
 3            Q.    So after Mr. Perrotto had the
 4      bronchoscopy, did he ultimately, before he had a
 5      lobectomy, did he have radiation and chemotherapy?
 6            A.    He did.
 7            Q.    Okay. So what is radiation therapy?
 8            A.    Well, radiation therapy is where an
 9      external beam of radiation therapy is delivered to the
 10      tumor. In this case, it would be delivered in the
 11      right upper chest area.
 12            Q.   And what is chemotherapy?
 13            A.    Chemotherapy is medications or drugs that
 14      are used to kill the tumor cells.
 15            Q.    So why do some patients get radiation
 16      therapy and chemotherapy, other patients get surgery,
 17      other patients just get chemotherapy? Why is there a
 18      difference in the treatment for some cancer patients?
 19            A.    Well, all cancers are not alike. And so, 2 o      for lung cancer, the treatment usually involves
 21      radiation and chemotherapy as kind of the first step. 2 2            Q.    Okay. And so after Mr. Perrotto had the 2 3     diagnosis made of lung cancer, as a result of the 2 4      radiation and chemotherapy, did he suffer from 2 5     something called esophagitis, radiation-induced
	Page   2099
 1      significant pain for many years?
 2            A.    It did. And this kind of resolved
 3      because it's more easily treatable than some of the
 4      other things; but the radiation pneumonitis caused him
 5      very severe discomfort for the rest of his life.
 6            Q.   Now, how does that work?
 7                 1 mean, as a doctor, when you're treating
 8      a cancer patient who has a significant cancer, is
 9      there sometimes a balancing between giving them drugs
 1 o     and therapies that will help, but may also cause
 11      significant side effects?
 12            A.    That's always the balance. And so you
 13      have to balance off what the potential is for not
 14      doing something compared to doing something. And we
 15      always know that radiation and chemotherapy will have
 16      substantial negative effects, but you're hopeful it
 17      will have the most positive effect to get rid of the
 18      cancer.
 19            Q.   So let's go to Page 12, the end of this
 2 o      discharge summary.
 21                 Now, at this point, just so we're clear
 2 2      where we are, had Mr. Perrotto had his lung removed
 2 3      yet?
 2 4             A.    Not yet, no.
 2 5            Q.   Okay. So what - what workup has been

Page   2098
 1      esophagitis?
 2             A.    He did. And he also had radiation
 3      pneumonitis, too.
 4             Q.    So what are those two terms,
 5      "esophagitis" and "pneumonitis"? How do they relate
 6      to Mr. Perrotto's case?
 7             A.    Well, when you have that kind of
 8      radiation therapy, it can be poisonous to other cells
 9      and other tissues, as well. And the same thing is
 1 o      true with chemotherapy. It's designed to go after the
 11      cancer cells, but it also has an effect on a lot of
 12      the other normal cells.
 13             Q.   And so was he admitted to the hospital on
 14      9/18/92, for a stay until 10/8/92, for dehydration and
 15      esophagitis secondary to chemotherapy and radiation
 16      for lung -
17             A.    That's what ~
 18             Q.    - cancer?
 19             A.    - the note says, yes.
 2 0            Q.    And on that admission, was he nauseous 21      and clinically dehydrated?
 2 2             A.    Yes.
 2 3            Q.    In reviewing the course of Mr. Perrotto's
 2 4      treatments, did you see that the effects of
 2 5      chemotherapy and radiation caused him serious,
	Page   2100
 1      done on Mr. Perrotto up until this point?
 2             A.    Well, they did a bunch of tests, blood
 3      tests, and they also did an upper endoscopy, where
 4      they diagnosed the -- the esophagitis.
 5                  And so they say here "dysphagia," which
 6      means he couldn't swallow ~ "dysphagia" means
 7      difficulty swallowing ~ and esophagitis secondary to
 8      the chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He had a
 9      fever, which could be due to the chemotherapy and/or
 1 o      radiation therapy.
 11                   He had granulocytopenia, which means his
 12      white blood count was suppressed. And the
 13      granulocytes are the particular blood cells that help
 14      people to fight infection. So he had a lower number
 15      of those than would be normal.
 16             Q.   What's the effect of having
 17      granulocytopenia? What's the practical effect on the i8     body?
 19            A.    It makes the person more susceptible to
 2 o      infection, because these are the first line of defense
 21      for bacterial infections in particular, granulocytes
 22      are. We call them polymorphonucleocytes, as well. 2 3      But the granulocytes just describes the white blood 2 4      cells that help ward off infections.
 2 5            Q.   He had anemia. What's that?

Page   2101
 1               A.    Well, his red blood cell count was low;
 2       but that also is a fairly common side effect to both
 3       chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
 4               Q.    Lung cancer, phlebitis -
5                     What is "phlebitis"?
 6               A.    "Phlebitis" is where there is
 7       infection -- or an inflammation in a vein. And he
 8       also had cellulitis, probably due to where they put
 9       medications in through -- intravenously into his arm. io            Q.   And he also had a perirectal abscess and
 11       fistula during this admission, right?
 12               A.    That's correct.
 13               Q.   Okay. And then he had to have that
 14       removed surgically?
 15               A.    He had to have that drained, yes.
 16               Q.   After Mr. Perrotto underwent his first
 17       round of chemotherapy and radiation, was there
 18       ultimately a decision made to then proceed towards
 19       surgery?
 2 0             A.    Yes.
 21               Q.   And why was that decision made?
 22               A.    Well, because he was relatively young and 2 3     otherwise relatively in good shape, was the reason 2 4     that they thought they might be able to remove the
 2 5      bulk of the tumor and get rid of it.
	Page   2103
 1                    All right. And the tumor was over in
 2       this area, right upper lobe?
 3              A.    Right upper lobe, yes.
 4              Q.   Okay. Now, traditionally, generally
 5       speaking, are patients who, upon presentation - so
 6       when they're first diagnosed by CT scan of the
 7       chest - when they have evidence at that time of tumor
 8       in the right upper lobe, and also involving the lymph
 9       nodes in their chest - so that means there's cancer io      in the lymph nodes in the chest at that time - are
 11       those types of patients traditionally operated on?
 12              A.    No.
 13              Q.   Why not?
 14              A.    Because that means that the cancer is
 15       already spread to the lymph nodes; and if it's spread
 16       to those lymph nodes, it's in the system, and you
 17       never know where it's going to turn up again and when
 18       it's going to turn up again.
 19              Q.   Okay. And how does cancer spread? 2 0             A.    It spreads through the lymphatics, but it 21      also can spread through the bloodstream. So the 2 2      lymphatics are the lymph channels that lead to the 2 3      lymph nodes, and they're --
2 4                   Basically, the lymph nodes catch things
 2 5      that are in the lymph system that could be hazardous,

Page   2102
 1              Q.    Prior to Mr. Perrotto having surgery, was
 2       there any evidence that the cancer had spread outside
 3       of the initial tumor area?
 4              A.    1 don't recall any evidence that it was
 5       involving the mediastinal nodes. That's what the --
6                     The mediastinum is the place right in
 7       front of the heart, and it's kind of a place where
 8       lymph nodes are that will drain the lung.
 9                     1 didn't see any evidence of the lymph
 1 o      nodes being involved, but it did say that there was
 11       really close -- close adjacency to the inside lining
 12       of the lung.
 13              Q.   Okay. So where is - where is the -
14                    You mentioned you didn't see any evidence
 15       in the initial reports, before he had the surgery, of
 16       mediastinal involvement.
 17                    Where is the mediastinum?
 18              A.    Well, it's kind of right in the middle.
 19       1 can't --
2 0                   Right -- right there (indicating). 21            Q.    This area here (indicating)? 2 2             A.    Yes.
 2 3            Q.   Okay. The area between the two lungs? 2 4             A.    Correct. And in front of the heart. 2 5            Q.    In front of the heart.
	Page   2104
 1       like bacteria or fungi, but then they also drain the
 2       tissue; and if they're cancer cells, that's the place
 3       where they land first, and then they begin to show up.
 4              Q.   Okay. Now, after-
5                    We discussed this a few minutes ago.
 6       After the radiation and the chemotherapy, did they
 7       make a decision to operate on Mr. Perrotto?
 8              A.    They did.
 9              Q.   And what type of procedure were they i o     going to do on Mr. Perrotto?
 11              A.    Well, they were going to do a right upper
 12       lobectomy to excise the tumor.
 13              Q.    So -
14                    And you say a right upper lobectomy to
 15       excise the tumor, but was the tumor in the entire
 16       right upper lobe?
 17              A.    It was not in the entire upper lobe, but
 18       just the way the anatomy is, you can't just go in and
 19       take out just the seven-centimeter mass. Because of
 2 0      the blood vessels and everything, you have to take out
 21       the whole upper lobe.
 22              Q.   And so we'll look at the record in a
 2 3      minute, but ultimately did Mr. Perrotto have - this 2 4     entire area that I'm highlighting with the red laser 2 5     beam, did he have all of that removed surgically,

	8
	was never proven.

9
	Q.    Right thoracotomy, what does that mean?
	9
	Q.   Okay. Did they show some evidence of

10
	A.    Opening up the right side of the chest.
	10
	that on pathology, at least?

11
	The thorax is what they're talking about.
	11
	A.    A little bit, but it was not ~

12
	The thoracotomy would be opening up the right side of
	12
	Again, you're dealing with very small

13
	the chest.
	13
	specimens. The needle biopsy is a very small ~ very

14
	Q.    And an extrapleural resection of the
	14
	small sliver of tissue.

15
	right upper lobe, is that what you talked about when
	15
	Q.   All right. We'll get into that in one

16
	they took out the entire right upper lobe of his lung?
	16
	second.

17
	A.    That's correct.
	17
	It says: He is a candidate for resection

18
	Q.    And preoperative diagnosis is
	18
	of his malignancy since he is a young man. Which he

19
	carcinoma - is that cancer? -
	19
	was, right?

20
	A.    Yes.
	20
	A.    That's correct; 53.

21
	Q.    - of the right upper lobe.

23
	Let's go to the top. Just the top, please.
	23
	So, at this point in time, prior to them

24
	So 1 want you to just put this into
	24
	cutting open his entire chest and looking at his right

25
	context. And I'll read it to you and 1 want you to

	Page   2108

1
	put it into context in light of what you just
	1
	evidence of any malignancy?

2
	explained to the jury, please.
	2
	A.    They did not.

3
	It says, under indications:
	3
	Q.   I'm sorry, any metastatic disease?

4
	Fifty-three-year-old man who has been found to have
	4
	A.    That's correct.

5
	non-small cell carcinoma of the right upper lobe.
	5
	Q.   And he says: Good pulmonary function

6
	What does that mean, "non-small cell
	6
	studies.

7
	carcinoma"?
	7
	What does that mean?

8
	A.    Well, there are four major types of
	8
	A.    Well, any time you do an operation on the

9
	carcinoma of the lung. Squamous cell carcinoma, which
	9
	chest, you want to make sure that they're able to

10
	is like skin; adenocarcinoma, which is like glands;
	10
	survive that. And one of the real problems is if a

11
	small cell carcinoma, which has really very small
	11
	person has abnormal pulmonary function studies and you

12
	cells; and then large cell carcinoma are the four
	12
	take out a very large section of the lung, they may

13
	major types.
	13
	not have enough remaining tissue to be able to

14
	So the distinction is that, for small
	14
	survive. So they do pulmonary function studies to

15
	cell carcinoma, the treatment is very different than
	15
	figure out whether or not he has the capability of

16
	the treatment of the ~
	16
	doing that.

17
	Small cell carcinoma is treated
	17
	Q.   Let's go down to the next section. It

18
	differently than the other types, mostly almost always
	18
	says: There was no free fluid ~

19
	treated with radiation and chemotherapy, because it's
	19
	There is no free fluid, and the middle

20
	more sensitive to that.
	20
	and lower lobes were normal. The right upper lobe had

21
	Q.   Which one is that?
	21
	a mass lesion which was adherent to the posterior

22
	A.    Small cell.
	22
	chest wall.

23
	Q.   Okay.
	23
	Is that the same description we saw on

24
	A.    So when they make the distinction between
	24
	the CT scan?

25
	non-small cell carcinoma, it's one of the other three
	25
	A.    Well, it said that it was adjacent to

 i     the -- to the posterior chest wall, but this means
 2      that it was really -- it was really up against it, and
 3      probably there were microscopic, if not gross,
 4      invasion of the chest wall by the cancer, itself.
 5             Q.   What does that mean, "microscopic, if not
 6      gross, invasion of the chest wall"?
 7             A.    That means it's not resectable.
 8             Q.   Okay. And it goes down here. And
 9      upper -
10                   A right upper lobectomy was then carried
 11      out by incising the mediastinal pleura. That's the
 12      procedure that was done?
 13             A.    That's correct.
 14             Q.   And at the bottom, it's signed by
 15      Dr. Rudolph Sheerer - second page of this - the
 16      physician who performed the operation, okay?
 17             A.    Yes.
 18             Q.   So after they do a procedure like this,
 19      does a physician take the right upper lobe, the
 2 o     entirety of it, and look at it under a microscope?
 21             A.    It's sent to the pathologist, yes.
 22             Q.   And what's that procedure called? What's 2 3     that specimen called, when they take a biop -
2 4                 In other words, what's - what's it
 2 5     called when you take out the tissue and you have
	Page   2111
 i                 We talked earlier about the earlier
 2      fine-needle aspirations, where they went and took a
 3      little piece of tissue. How would you weigh the
 4      availability of information, comparing this report,
 5      where you have the entirety of the lung, versus the
 6      earlier tests where they had just a little tiny
 7      sample?
 8             A.    This is definitive and the other is not.
 9             Q.   And when they made the definitive
 1 o      diagnosis, it says "right upper lobe" with what type n     of cancer?
 12             A.    Adenocarcinoma.
 13             Q.   Moderately and poorly differentiated,
 14      right?
 15             A.    Correct.
 16             Q.   Now, can people have an adenocarcinoma
 17      with some other features mixed in, in some of the
 18      cells?
 19             A.    They can.
 20             Q.   Okay. And did Mr. Perrotto have that, 1
 21      guess; they saw earlier evidence of, you know, some
 2 2     neuroendocrine features?
 2 3            A.    Well, but that was -- that was --
2 4                  Again, that was just based on the very
 2 5      small amount of tissue. This is much more definitive

Page   2110
 i     someone look at it?
 2             A.    Well, they do sections of all -- all or
 3      part of it. They can have a lot more tissue that they
 4      can look at under the microscope. They can take
 5      specimens from different parts of the cancer.
 6             Q.    Let's take a look at 32, Request to
 7      Produce 32. There you go.
 8                   So is this -
9                    MR. COFER: I'm sorry, what's the date of io            this?
 n                  MR. GDANSKI: The date of this is
 12              11/12/92.
 13                    MR. COFER: 11/12/92.
 14             Q.    From Dr. Margaret Skinner, a pathologist.
 15      And it's from the Good Samaritan Medical Center
 16      pathology department. Do you see that?
 17             A.    Yes.
 18             Q.   Okay. And this is the final diagnosis,
 19      right?
 2 0            A.    Correct.
 21            Q.    Now, is this the best opportunity for any
 2 2      physician to look at the entirety of what's taking
 2 3      place in Mr. Perrotto's right upper lobe of his lung?
 2 4            A.    That's correct.
 2 5            Q.   Okay. And if you had to -
	Page   2112
 i     than that.
 2             Q.   Okay. Tumor appears to penetrate into
 3      the fibrous tissue of the pleural surface, but is not
 4      present on the outer surface which has been inked.
 5                   So did Mr. Perrotto's tumor penetrate
 6      into the fibrous tissue of his pleural surface?
 7             A.    It did.
 8             Q.   What does that mean?
 9             A.    Well, that's what we talked about
 io     earlier. It had gotten into the pleura. So it was
 11      invasive into the pleura, and -- but they don't think
 12      that it went through there to the outer --
13                   So the pleura is the lining of the lung
 14      and the lining of the inside of the chest wall. So it
 15      got into the pleura, so it was more extensive than
 16      they had originally thought.
 17             Q.   Then it says "metastatic." What does
 18      that term mean, "metastatic"?
 19             A.    That's where the cancer has spread to
 20      some other sites.
 21             Q.   Adenocarcinoma - is that the type they 2 2     saw in the tumor? -
2 3            A.    Yes.
 2 4            Q.   - is present in three of six hilar lymph
 2 5     nodes. What's that mean?

Page   2113

1              A.    Well, that means that they sample --

2                     They took out six lymph nodes from the

3       area around the main bronchial tube, which is the

4       hilus of the lung, and three of the six were found to

5       have this same cancer, the adenocarcinoma.

6              Q.   And just to be certain, did this

7       physician, who has cared for and treating Mr. Perrotto

8       while he was alive, did she go back and compare the

9       tissue from the entire right upper lobe to some of the

1 o       earlier tissue which had been removed during the

11       fine-needle aspirations?

12              A.    She did.

13              Q.    Now, can we go back to the anatomical

14       drawing for one second?

15                    So we said that his tumor was up in this

16       area, the right upper lobe; right?

17              A.    Correct.

18              Q.    And now we see, when they took out his

19       entire right upper lobe of his lung, they took out the

2 o       entire thing, they see that there's some tumor in the 21       lymph nodes over here?

2 2              A.    That's correct. That would be the hilar

2 3       area. The hilar area is where the main bronchial

2 4       tubes go into -- go up into the windpipe. 2 5              Q.   So how did that happen? How did it get

Page   2114

1       from here to here (indicating)?

2              A.    Well, the lymphatics. There are lymph

3       vessels just like there are blood vessels, and the

4       lymph vessels drain all of the ~ all of the tissue

5       that we have, and it goes into the lymph nodes. And

6       those are kind of the filters that - that filter out

7       bad things. And so bad things like cancers can get

8       caught in the filters and they stay there.

9              Q.   So what's the significance, what's the

1 o       importance of now knowing that Mr. Perrotto had cancer

11       that started in the right upper lobe but had already

12       spread to lymph nodes in the middle of his chest?

13              A.    Well, that's just the only place we found

14       that - or they found that it was spread.

15                    What we know about this is that, in the

16       blood of people who are developing lung cancer, it can

17       be in the blood even several years before it is found

18       in some - some - some place, like in the lungs or

19       other places.

20                    So the assumption here is, since he had

21       malignancies in the lymph nodes, that it had spread

2 2       into other areas, as well, but they just haven't ~ 2 3       haven't grown enough to be able to be manifest. 2 4              Q.   And why is it such an ominous -

2 5                   Why is it such a scary finding from a

Page   2115

1       medical perspective to now know that the cancer is not

2       just in the right upper lobe tumor, but it has spread

3       outside of the tumor into the lymph node system? Why

4       is that so scary?

5              A.    Well, because you don't ~ you never know

6       where it's going to turn up next.

7              Q.   And what's traditionally -

8                   We'll get to it.

9                   So he had this procedure done. Was he

1 o       discharged from the hospital?

11              A.    Yes.

12              Q.   Okay. Now, after he had this procedure

13       done, did you see that he, in fact, continued to have

14       additional radiation therapy?

15              A.    Yes.

16              Q.   And why did he have that?

17                   In other words, they took it out, it's

18       gone, they took out the lymph nodes in the chest, they

19       took out the tumor. Why are they still giving him

2 o       radiation?

21              A.    Well, because he had metastatic lesions,

2 2       metastatic lesions in the lymph nodes.

23              Q.   Is there an idea in medicine called

2 4       "prophylactic radiation"?

2 5              A.    There is.

Page   2116

i             Q.   And what does that mean, to get

2       prophylactic radiation?

3              A.    That means you do radiation to an area in

4       hopes that you're going to kill off the remaining

5       cells that might be there.

6              Q.    Even if you haven't seen them yet?

7              A.    That's correct.

8              Q.   And did Mr. Perrotto, after he had his

9       surgery and the three out of six hilar lymph nodes

1 o       taken out in November of 1996, did his physician still

11       think it was necessary to give him prophylactic,

12       protective, radiation?

13                     MR. COFER: Objection, misstated. You

14              said "November of '96," you meant November of

15              '92.

16                     MR. GDANSKI: Sorry.

17              Q.   November of '92.

18              A.    Well-

19              Q.   Yeah, let me ask that - let me ask that

2 o       one again from the beginning.

21                    After Mr. Perrotto had his right upper

2 2       lobe taken out, the tumor removed from that area

2 3       there, and the three out of six hilar lymph nodes

2 4       found, seen, inspected and removed, did his

2 5       physicians, nonetheless, still think thereafter that

	it was necessary for him to have prophylactic,

	But you see it says, radiation

	2
	pneumonitis, clinically unchanged?

3
	MR. COFER: Objection; leading, calls for
	3
	A.    Correct.

4
	speculation.
	4
	Q.   And what's the importance of that?

5
	THE COURT: Sustained.
	5
	Now he's finished his radiation, he's had

6
	Q.   Why did his doctors give him radiation
	6
	the surgery. Why is it important to know, in the

7
	after he had his surgery and the tumor removed from
	7
	context of this case, that Mr. Perrotto is still

8
	his chest?
	8
	suffering extremely from radiation pneumonitis?

9
	A.    With the hopes it would kill off any
	9
	A.    Well, it's kind of two reasons. One,

10
	remaining cancer cells.
	10
	it's very debilitating. "Debilitating," meaning he

11
	Q.    Did you see that Mr. Perrotto still
	11
	was not well. And the second thing is that one of the

12
	continued, into the middle of 1993, to complain of
	12
	ways to treat this is to use steroids. And underneath

13
	this radiation pneumonitis?
	13
	there, it says, continue prednisone.

14
	A.    Correct.
	14
	And so prednisone is one of the steroids

15
	Q.   All right. Let's take a look at
	15
	used to quiet down the inflammation; but steroids,

16
	Number 41. It's a note from Dr. Rothschild's office
	16
	like prednisone, have other effects on the body, to

17
	from June 16th, 1993.
	17
	weaken its ability to fight infection, do all

18
	All right. So this is -- this is a
	18
	different kinds of things when you're on steroids.

19
	little bit different-looking record. It's a
	19
	Q.   All right. So that was my next question

20
	handwritten record. Do you see that?
	20
	to you. As a result of Mr. Perrotto's continuing

	Q.   Okay. So can you see that this is from
	22
	did his physicians keep him on a course of drugs, on

23
	Palm Beach Oncology and Hematology, at the top?
	23
	steroids?

24
	A.    It is.
	24
	A.    Well, not only steroids, but other --

25
	Q.   And that's Dr. Neal Rothschild's office?
	25
	other drugs, as well.


	Page   2118
	
	Page   2120

1
	A.    Correct.
	1
	Q.    Okay. And here the plan is: Continue

2
	Q.   And so you've heard of this term -
	2
	prednisone, 20 milligrams a day?

3
	Well, let's just back up one second,
	3
	A.    Correct.

4
	Danny. Take that down.
	4
	Q.   Is that a large dose?

5
	I'm sure, Doctor, you see the initials,
	5
	A.    No. It's -- but it's a substantial dose.

6
	here, SAPO?
	6
	It's not a large, huge dose.

7
	A.    I'm not seeing it, no.
	7
	Q.   Okay. It's normal to treat this kind of

8
	Q.    Right on the left side of the page.
	8
	pain?

9
	There's the "S." Underneath that, "A"?
	9
	A.    Correct.

10
	A.    Yes.
	10
	Q.    Gotcha. All right.

11
	Q.   Okay. And so is that subjective,
	11
	A.    It's not really treating the pain; it's

12
	assessment, plan, objective?
	12
	treating the inflammation, which is the cause of the

13
	A.    Yes.
	13
	pain.

14
	Q.   Okay. Now, let's look at what
	14
	Q.    Understood.

15
	Dr. Rothschild writes under Nick Perrotto's status at
	15
	It's there to hopefully reduce some of

16
	the time in June of 1993.
	16
	the pain?

17
	Are you able to read it?
	17
	A.    That's correct.

18
	A.    No.
	18
	Q.    Did you see that Mr. Perrotto remained on

19
	Q.    Okay. It says: Radiation pneumonitis -
	19
	drugs, on medications, in order to treat the

20
	do you see that? - clinically unchanged?
	20
	inflammation that he had as a result of the treatments

21
	A.    Correct.
	21
	for lung cancer, for several years?

22
	Q.   Very hard to read -
	22
	A.    1 think until he died. 1 think he was on

23
	A.    It is hard to read.
	23
	some -- some steroids, as well as other -- other

24
	Q.   - but I have the benefit of
	24
	medications, almost until his death.

25
	Dr. Rothschild down the street.
	25
	Q.    So can you explain that to the jury?

 1       Because I'm going to walk you now up to 1996.
 2                    Between 1993 and 1996, did
 3       Mr. Perrotto - did he continue to take, as a result
 4       of his doctors' orders and their prescriptions to him,
 5       medications to treat the effects of his lung cancer?
 6              A.    Well, it was really treating the effects
 7       of his treatment for lung cancer, which is sometimes
 8       hard to distinguish between the two.
 9              Q.   Okay. Well, would he ever have had
 1 o      treatment for lung cancer if he didn't have lung
 11       cancer?
 12              A.    Correct.
 13              Q.   He would not have, right?
 14              A.    Correct.
 15              Q.   All right. So why was it the case that
 16       for two - for one, two, three years, after this lung
 17       cancer is found and excised, he's still being
 18       essentially treated for the effects of the radiation
 19       and the chemotherapy that he had one, two, three years
 2 o     ago?
 21            A.    Well, because it was debilitating. He
 2 2      was -- he was uncomfortable, he couldn't function in a
 2 3      normal way because of the discomfort and the pain.
 2 4            Q.   And did you see, in early '96,
 2 5      Mr. Perrotto was ultimately - he had some gastritis,
	Page   2123
 1              Q.   January 19th, 1996. It's Number 81,
 2       please.
 3                    So this is from West Boca Medical Center,
 4       the date's there, January '96, and this was the
 5       admission for gastritis, where they said maybe, you
 6       know, he had a bad egg salad sandwich, drank a little
 7       too much beer?
 8              A.    Well, that was part of the history.
 9              Q.    Okay. What I want to focus on is what
 10       the physician noted was going on with Mr. Perrotto at
 11       the time, okay?
 12              A.    Okay.
 13              Q.   Gotcha. Are you able to read that, or
 14       you want me to read it out?
 15                    1 can do it.
 16              A.    Fifty-six-year-old white male with right
 17       upper lobectomy, subsequent radiation therapy, and
 18       chemo, with a little arrow ~ going to ~
 19              Q.   What does -
2 0             A.    --developing radiation pneumonitis.
 21            Q.    Okay. What does the arrow mean in the
 2 2      context of a medical record?
 2 3             A.    That means it's this led to that. So
 2 4      radiation therapy and chemo led to radiation
 2 5      pneumonitis.

Page   2122
 1       some stomach problems?
 2              A.    Correct.
 3              Q.    And he went into the hospital on two
 4       separate occasions?
 5              A.    Correct.
 6              Q.    Now, let's take a look -
7                    And when you go to the hospital, why is
 8       it important for the physicians at the time to get a
 9       full and complete picture of what's going on with you,
 10       your history, what you've been through, what you're
 11       being treated for, what drugs you're on? Why is that
 12       really critically important?
 13              A.    Well, you can't arrive to the correct
 14       diagnosis; and if you don't get the right diagnosis,
 15       you don't give the right treatment.
 16              Q.   Okay. And so let's take a look at an
 17       admission progress note from January 19th, 1996.
 18       We're going to fast-forward three years. We don't
 19       have a lot of records in between those intervening 2 0      years, right?
 21              A.    1 didn't see any, no.
 22              Q.   Okay. Passage of time, sometimes records 2 3      get destroyed through nobody's fault?
 2 4                   MR. COFER: Objection, leading. 25                  THE COURT: Sustained.
	Page   2124
 1               Q.    Okay.
 2               A.    So 1 can't make out what the first one
 3       is.
 4               Q.    Chronic?
 5              A.    Oh, on chronic steroids. Percodan --
6               Q.   What's Percodan?
 7              A.    Percodan is a narcotic analgesic.
 8               Q.    So why was Mr. Perrotto on chronic
 9       Percodan - or why was he on Percodan, even if it
 10       wasn't chronic?
 11                     Why is he taking Percodan three years
 12       after lung cancer?
 13               A.    Because of the pain and debilitation.
 14               Q.    Okay.
 15              A.    And intermittent NSAIDs.
 16                     NSAIDs are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
 17       drugs. Naprosyn is one. There's Voltaren. There's a
 18       whole bunch of them. And they are used to treat pain.
 19       They're non-narcotic, they're ~ And they're also
 2 o      nonsteroids, so they have fewer of those kind of side
 21     effects, but the major side effect that they can have
 2 2      is causing irritation of the stomach and the
 2 3     esophagus.
 2 4            Q.    Okay. And then it says, with four plus
 2 5     beers daily. Do you see that?

1               A.    I see that.

2               Q.    Did you see that in the '96 admissions to

3       the West Boca Medical Center, Mr. Perrotto, he gave a

4       history of drinking a little too much beer?

5               A.    I don't recall that.

6               Q.    Okay. My question to you is: In any of

7       the depositions you read from Mr. Perrotto's entire

8       life, his wife, his ex-wife, his son, his children,

9       did any of them ever report Mr. Perrotto as a heavy

1 o       alcohol drinker?

11               A.    They did not.

12               Q.   Okay. Is it sometimes the occasion that

13       when a patient has, you know, end-of-life disease,

14       they might drink a little bit too much?

15                      MR. COFER: Objection, leading.

16                      THE COURT: Sustained.

17               Q.    | would like you to assume that

18       Dr. Alley, Dr. David Alley, who is Mr. Perrotto's

19       primary care doctor, in charge of taking care of him,

2 0       he told Mr. Perrotto, listen, you're ~ you're not

21       free and clear of your lung cancer, unfortunately, and

22       if you want to drink a little bit, you can, I give you 2 3       permission.

2 4                     Is that something you've seen -

2 5                      MR. COFER: Objection.

Page   2126

1               Q.   - happen between physicians and

2       patients?

3                     THE COURT: Go ahead, Mr. Cofer, state

4               your objection.

5                     MR. COFER: Complete lack of foundation.

6                     THE COURT: Sustained.

7              Q.   We'll see it.

8                     And, so, is this consistent with what was

9      taking place in Mr. Perrotto's medical history? 10            A.    Say that again.

li               Q.    Is this history here, what's reported

12       right here in these notes, is that consistent with

13       your understanding of what took place previously with

14       Mr. Perrotto?

15               A.    It is.

16               Q.    Now, in August of '96, about six months,

17       seven months after this, did Mr. Perrotto suffer from

18       a seizure?

19               A.    He did.

2 0               Q.    Okay. So what's-

21                     How did that happen? What happened?

22               A.   Well, he had what's called a grand mal

2 3       seizure, which is a catastrophic sort of seizure. It

2 4       would be like a person developing epilepsy and they

2 5       lose consciousness, they have a postictal loss of

Page   2127

1       memory. So, after the seizure, they don't remember

2       what happened during the time; they can sometimes lose

3       continence of their bowel or bladder.

4                     And a grand mal ~ a new grand mal

5       seizure in an adult means something in the brain has

6       gone wrong until proven otherwise.

7              Q.   This is August of '96. He was diagnosed

8       in November of 1992. About how many years is that? A

9      little less than four years? 10            A.    A little less than four.

li              Q.   In your medical practice as a cancer

12       specialist, treating patients at the Mayo Clinic, is

13       there a recognized time frame in which you say that a

14       patient is, you know, free and clear of their cancer?

15                     MR. COFER: Objection, lack of

16               foundation.

17                     THE COURT: Sustained.

18              Q.   How many years have to go by for

19       physicians to understand that a patient is cured and 2 o       free and clear of a cancer diagnosis?

21               A.    Well, we use for--

2 2                     For lung cancer, in particular, and for

2 3       most cancers, you use five years. For pancreatic

2 4       cancer, it's two years. For breast cancer, it could

2 5       be much longer. So each individual group of cancers

Page   2128

1       has their own long-term survival figure.

2              Q.   The day before Mr. Perrotto had his grand

3       mal seizure, so the day before they knew that

4       something was going on in his brain, was he medically

5       cured of his lung cancer?

6               A.     No.

7              Q.   Okay. Was he someone who you would

8       consider a cancer survivor?

9            A.     No.

io            Q.   Okay. Was he someone you would consider

li       a patient who still needs to be actively treated and

12       looked at for lung cancer?

13               A.    Correct.

14              Q.   And so, on August 12th, 1996, he's with

15       Debbie in the car, you saw in the deposition, he

16       starts to lose all sense of orientation, she rushes

17       him to the hospital, and then, in the waiting room, on

18       the floor, he passes out, hits the floor and has a

19       seizure in front of everybody; right?

2 0               A.    That was what's reported, yes.

21              Q.   Let's take a look at West Boca Medical

2 2       Center 26, please.

2 3                    So this is now a CT scan with and without

2 4       contrast of the brain, right?

2 5                     MR. COFER: What's the date, Counsel?

1                      MR. GDANSKI: August 12th,'96.

2                      MR. COFER: Thank you.

3               Q.    So -

4               A.    Yes.

5               Q.   All right. Now, this is at West Boca,

6       and it's a radiology report. CT with and without

7       contrast of the brain.

8                      Let's drop down. It says he has a

9      four-centimeter enhancing right posterior parieto -10             A.    Parieto, yeah.

ii               Q.   - parieto-occipital -

12                     What does that mean, a parieto-occipital?

13               A.    Parieto-occipital.

14                      Occipital is the very back part of the

15       brain; and then the parietal lobe is the next one

16       going forward in the brain. So it's kind of in -- in

17       between the two - two areas.

18               Q.    Mass, as described, consistent with

19       primary or secondary neoplasm.

2 o                     "Neoplasm" means cancer?

21               A.    Yes.

22               Q.   Metastatic disease should be specifically 2 3       ruled out in this patient with an apparent history of 2 4       primary lung carcinoma. Right?

2 5               A.    That's what it says.

Page   2130

1              Q.   What does that mean?

2              A.    Well, that's - they're just ~

3                    The radiologist is just giving some of

4       the clinical perspective of what they think should be

5       done next given his history.

6              Q.   And was it important for the physicians

7       to figure out, hey, you know, we're on the ground, we

8       see this guy and he's coming in having a seizure in

9       our hallway, let's figure out where the cancer in his 10       brain came from?

n                     MR. COFER: Objection, leading.

12                    THE COURT: Sustained.

13              Q.   Why is it important for the physicians

14       who are treating a patient who has a disease in the

15       brain, cancer in the brain, to figure out where it

16       came from?

17              A.    So that they can give better treatment.

18              Q.   And let's take a look, then, at a history

19       and physical. It's West Boca Medical Center Number 9 2 0       of Dr. Glenn Gidseg.

21                     So this is dated 8/13/96, Nick Perrotto,

2 2       history and physical.

2 3                    What's a history and physical?

2 4              A.    Well, you take a history from talking to

2 5       the patient, and then do a physical. That's the

Page   2131

1       standard way we start out. We start out with the

2       chief complaint, what -- what brought you here, and

3       then the history is taken, and then an examination.

4                      So, like most of our diagnoses is made by

5       history, and that's - that kind of leads us to do

6       whatever else we're going to do.

7               Q.   Headaches, weakness, dizziness and a

8       seizure prior to admission, did all of that take place

9      with Mr. Perrotto? 10             A.    Yes.

ii               Q.   The patient is a 56-year-old white male

12       in his usual state of fair to poor health until the

13       evening prior to admission when he developed

14       moderately severe dizziness associated with mild

15       headache and weakness.

16                      Do you see that?

17               A.    Yes.

18               Q.   Okay. And is that all true and

19       reflective of what took place based on Debbie's

2 0       deposition, who - she was there with him when all

21       this took place - and the medical records?

2 2               A.    I think that's correct, yes.

2 3               Q.    Let's go to social history on Page

2 4       Number 2.

2 5                     And what's a social history?

Page   2132

1               A.    Well, a social history is where people

2       work, their ingestion of alcohol, smoking are all part

3       of the social history. That would be part ~ part of

4       that.

5              Q.   He used to be a manager of an automobile

6       agency, that's what he did, worked here at Del ray

7       Mazda; right?

8               A.    Yes.

9              Q.   He was on disability for the last several

1 o      years, following his surgery for his lung cancer. ii                    So my question to you, Dr. Hurt, is:

12       After his surgery for his lung cancer, did he ever

13       just, you know, recover and just become basically

14       okay?

15               A.    No. And as the chief complaint in the

16       initial history said, he -- he really had poor health,

17       so ~ since the time of his diagnosis.

18              Q.   He used to smoke two to three packs per

19       day for many years, as mentioned above. And then it

2 o       says, he started drinking relatively heavily in the

21       last several years.

22                     Do you see that? 2 3             A.    Yes.

2 4              Q.   And let's just back up so that we know

2 5       what it's talking about when it says "as mentioned

i       above."

2                    Let me find it. It's one, two, three -

3       seven lines down on the past medical history.

4                    The page before, please, Danny.

5                    The page earlier. Sorry. Number 8.

6                    There it is. So it's right here.

7                    He smoked two to three packs - he smoked

8       two to three packs per day for 40 years, but stopped

9      just prior to surgery.

io                 Do you see that?

11              A.    That's correct.

12              Q.   Okay. And if Mr. Perrotto smoked two to

13       three packs per day for 40 years, but stopped just

14       prior to surgery, when would that put us at a start

15       date for his smoking?

16              A.    What now? I'm sorry, what now?

17              Q.   Yeah. He smoked for 40 years, but

18       stopped just prior to surgery, which he had in '92.

19                    '92 minus 40;'52,'53. 1952,1953. 2 o       Make sense?

21              A.    Yes.

22              Q.   Okay. So based on this record, and this

2 3       hospital record from West Boca Medical Center, are we

2 4       able to trace back Mr. Perrotto's smoking initiation

2 5       of two to three packs per day to 1952 to 1953?

1                     MR. COFER: Objection; leading,

2              foundation.

3                     THE COURT: Sustained.

4              Q.   When does this record tell us that

5       Mr. Perrotto started smoking?

6              A.    Well, it would be around -- around the

7       age that he was reported otherwise. Around the age of

8       13 or so.

9            Q.    Okay. And let's go to Page Number 10 of i o      this, the last page of this report.

ii                     He gives an assessment, a middle-aged

12       male with a history of lung cancer. Patient now comes

13       in with a new onset of seizures and a brain mass on

14       CT, most likely consistent with what?

15              A.    Metastatic lung cancer.

16               Q.    Okay. And so what does that mean now?

17                     So we're seeing a term, "metastatic lung

18       cancer." When a patient has cancer and it starts in

19       the lung, like we know Mr. Perrotto's did, and it

2 0       spreads to the brain, like we know Mr. Perrotto's did,

21       how do you describe that type of cancer?

2 2                     MR. COFER: Objection, lack of

2 3              foundation.

2 4                     THE COURT: Sustained.

2 5              Q.    How do you -

Page   2135

1                      What do you call a cancer that spreads

2       from one place to another?

3               A.    It's called metastatic cancer.

4               Q.    Okay. So would you say that Mr. Perrotto

5       had brain cancer?

6                A.    No.

7               Q.   Okay. What would you say he had?

8               A.    He had cancer in the brain, but it was

9      not a primary brain cancer. It was a metastatic io      cancer.

11               Q.    And where did it come from, the cancer in

12       the brain?

13                       MR. COFER: Objection, lack of

14               foundation.

15                      THE COURT: Sustained.

16               Q.    Based on your medical knowledge of this

17       case, the cancer found in Mr. Perrotto's brain, where

18       did it start?

19                       MR. COFER: Object -- object to the form,

20                improper standard.

21                      THE COURT: Counsel, sidebar.

2 2                       (The following discussion was held at

2 3                sidebar:)

2 4                      THE COURT: Wait for all counsel.

2 5                      Yes, Mr. Cofer.

Page   2136

1                       MR. COFER: If he's going to offer an

2                opinion that it's his opinion to a reasonable

3                degree of medical certainty that it started in

4                the lung, went to the brain, that's fine, he

5                can lay the foundation, but it can't be as a

6                conduit for hearsay.

7                       MR. GDANSKI: What? I don't know what

8                that means. I said, where did the cancer in

9                the brain start. That's just layperson talk of 10                do you have an opinion -

n                       THE COURT: Is he a layperson or is he an

12                expert? What he's testifying as?

13                       MR. GDANSKI: As an expert, as an expert.

14                Where did Mr. Perrotto's cancer in his brain

15                start?

16                       MR. COFER: To a reasonable degree of

17                medical certainty. No foundation.

18                       THE COURT: Just do it that way.

19                       MR. GDANSKI: Sure. Okay. 2 0                       THE COURT: Do it that way. 21                       All right. Thank you.

2 2                      (The sidebar discussion was concluded and

2 3                the following was held in open court:)

2 4                       THE COURT: The objection is sustained,

15
	A.    I have.
	15
	Q.   Okay. And that's Neal Rothschild. Let's

16
	Q.   Where did it start?
	16
	look at -

4
	MR. WEAVER: Instruction, Your Honor.
	4
	Q.    Now -

5
	THE COURT: And, ladies and gentlemen,
	5
	And you look at the medical record, it

6
	please disregard the last question by counsel.
	6
	says "reason for admission." What did Dr. Rothschild

7
	Q.   Okay. After he was admitted to West
	7
	write was the reason for admission?

8
	Boca, did he get transferred to Good Samaritan
	8
	A.    Well, he says here, originally diagnosed

9
	Hospital?
	9
	with a locally advanced non-small cell carcinoma of

10
	A.    1 think so, yes.
	10
	the right upper lobe.

11
	Q.   Was that so that Dr. Rothschild, his
	11
	Q.   Okay.

12
	cancer doctor, could now assume, reassume primary care
	12
	A.    The tumor was adenocarcinoma,

13
	responsibility, management?
	13
	moderately-poorly differentiated.

14
	A.    Correct.
	14
	Q.   And the tumor was an adenocarcinoma,

15
	Q.   And let's take a look at the history and
	15
	moderately-poorly differentiated. You said that

16
	physical from Good Samaritan Hospital, Number 7. 1
	16
	earlier, 15 minutes ago; right?

17
	think it's Good 7. This is now -
	17
	A.    I did.

18
	So now he's been moved, right? They
	18
	Q.   Okay. Is that absolutely a hundred

19
	ambulanced him up from Boca to Good Samaritan, and now
	19
	percent consistent with what Dr. Rothschild wrote in

20
	Dr. Rothschild gets him in Good Samaritan, he's going
	20
	1996?

21
	to take care of him there; right?
	21
	A.    Yes.

22
	A.    That's correct.
	22
	Q.   It was present in three out of six hilar

23
	Q.   Okay. Neal Rothschild, 8/13/96, he's
	23
	lymph nodes. We discussed that earlier, right?

	admitted. And I have just one simple question for you
	24
	A.    Yes.

25
	right now: Was Mr. Perrotto admitted to Good

1       and had no further problems related to his tumor,

2       although he has had chronic dyspnea.

3                    What's "chronic dyspnea"?

4              A.    Shortness of breath.

5              Q.   On exertion secondary to, presumably,

6       radiation scarring.

7                    Is that the pneumonitis you talked about?

8               A.    That's correct.

9              Q.   Of the lung and preexisting COPD.

1 o                    What does "COPD" stand for?

11               A.    "COPD" is emphysema. It stands for

12       chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

13              Q.   Did Mr. Perrotto have chronic obstructive

14       pulmonary disease?

15              A.    Yes.

16              Q.   And do you have an opinion to a

17       reasonable degree of medical probability as to what

18       caused Mr. Perrotto's chronic obstructive pulmonary

19       disease?

2 0               A.    His 40 years of smoking.

21              Q.   Did all of the cigarettes that

2 2       Mr. Perrotto smoked, including those manufactured by

2 3       Lorillard, Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

2 4       Company, substantially contribute to cause his COPD?

4                       THE COURT: Sustained.

5               Q.    Did the cigarettes that Mr. Perrotto

6       smoked throughout his life all substantially

7       contribute to cause his COPD?

8                       MR. COFER: Same objection.

9                   THE COURT: Rephrase.

io               Q.   How did the cigarettes he smoked cause

11        his COPD?

12                A.    How did they do it?

13               Q.   Yeah.

14                A.    Well, they caused obstruction, and then

15       they caused breakage of the little alveoli, which are

16       the little air sacs.

17               Q.   Did the cigarettes that he smoked between

18       the age of 13 and 23 play a substantial role in

19       contributing to cause his COPD?

2 0                       MR. WEAVER: Objection, foundation.

21                       THE COURT: Overruled.

2 2                A.    Sure.

2 3               Q.   And did the cigarettes he smoked between

2 4       the age of 23 and 33 play a substantial role in

2 5       contributing to cause his COPD?

Page   2143

1               A.    They did.

2              Q.   Did the cigarettes he smoked between 33

3       and 43 play a substantial role in contributing to

4       cause his COPD?

5               A.    They did.

6              Q.   And did the cigarettes he smoked between

7       43 and 53 play a substantial role in contributing to

8       cause his COPD?

9            A.    They did.

io              Q.   And were those all cigarettes made by the

11       three companies here, Lorillard, R.J. Reynolds, and

12       Philip Morris?

13               A.    They were.

14              Q.   Let's go down on this record. Social

15       history, he's been a heavy smoker in the past.

16                     But for -

17                    Let me ask one question. But for

18       Mr. Perrotto's smoking cigarettes - so if he never

19       smoked - would he have developed COPD? 2 0               A.    It would be highly unlikely.

21              Q.   Okay. And but for Mr. Perrotto's smoking

2 2       cigarettes, would he have ever developed lung cancer? 2 3               A.    Very highly unlikely.

2 4              Q.   Okay. And do you have an opinion to a

2 5       reasonable degree of medical probability that but for

Page   2144

1       his smoking of cigarettes - so remove the smoking ~

2       but for his smoking of cigarettes, he would have

3       avoided his COPD and lung cancer?

4               A.    He would have.

5               Q.    Social history. He had been a heavy

6       smoker in the past. That's consistent with the

7       records, right?

8               A.    Uh-huh.

9               Q.   And it's signed on the second page by 10       Dr. Rothschild?

n               A.    Right.

12               Q.    Now, is it always the case, Dr. Hurt,

13       that a physician will care for a patient from

14       diagnosis?

15                     So like Dr. Rothschild cared for

16       Mr. Perrotto when he was diagnosed with lung cancer,

17       all the way until death. Is that always the case?

18               A.    Not always, but that's the best way to do

19         it.

2 0               Q.    Because that person knows a lot about

21       their patient, right?

2 2               A.    That's correct.

2 3               Q.    Neal Rothschild. All right. Let's go

24       to-

2 5                     So what happens? Tell the jury what

 i     happened and then we'll look at the records.
 2                    He comes to the hospital, they do the CT
 3       scan at West Boca, he's got a tumor in his brain, they
 4       think it came from his lung. What do they do next?
 5              A.    Well, because of the symptoms and because
 6       of the pressure, they elected to open up his skull,
 7       basically, and remove the cancer from his brain.
 8              Q.   Okay. Let's go to 38, please.
 9                    So this is now an operative report from a
 1 o      craniotomy?
 n             A.    Correct.
 12              Q.   Okay. What-
13                    Do we have that little drawing of the
 14       craniotomy?
 15                    This is a crude drawing from Google, but
 16       an example of a craniotomy procedure. Do you see i7     that?
 18              A.    Ido.
 19              Q.   All right. So what happens? What is a
 2 o      craniotomy?
 21              A.    Well, in order to get to the brain
 22       substance, you have to, first of all, remove the
 2 3      scalp; and then, after that, you have to remove a 2 4      section of the bone to be able to get to where --2 5      where the cancer is. And so this kind of shows it
	Page   2147
 1               Q.    And then after you pull the skin back,
 2       you've got to remove the bone flap, the area
 3       protecting -
4                     I'm sorry, you've got to remove the
 5       scalp, right? First the skin, then the scalp? Or is
 6       that the same thing?
 7              A.    Well, the skin flap would be the scalp,
 8       yes.
 9               Q.    Okay. After that, you've got to remove i o     the bone, the area that protects us, protects our
 11       brain; right?
 12                     MR. MAGUIRE: Objection to counsel
 13               testifying.
 14                     THE COURT: Sustained.
 15               Q.    What's the bone flap?
 16               A.    Bone flap is a section of the -- of the
 17       skull that was, basically, sawed away so you could
 18       open up and be able to see inside where -- where the
 19       cancer was.
 2 0            Q.    And then you get to the brain tissue,
 21      right?
 2 2            A.    That's correct.
 2 3            Q.    Did they really do this with Nick
 2 4      Perrotto?
 2 5            A.    They did.

Page   2146
 1       graphically.
 2              Q.   Okay. This--
3                    And 1 don't think they cut him in this
 4       area, right? In other words, this is just a
 5       demonstrative. It's not meant to represent exactly
 6       what took place -
7              A.    No, it would --
8              Q.   - with Mr. Perrotto?
 9              A.    -- have been a little bit further to the
 1 o      back.
 li            Q.   All right. But the idea, the concept of
 12       what takes place during the craniotomy is laid out on
 13       this demonstrative. Fair?
 14              A.    That's correct.
 15              Q.   So first you got to shave the head,
 16       right?
 17              A.    Correct.
 18              Q.   The whole head?
 19              A.    Correct.
 20              Q.   Okay. And then you pull back the skin
 21       flap, the portion that we feel on our scalp that we
 2 2      can sort of move around; right?
 2 3             A.    Well, you just make an incision down to 2 4      the bone and pull the flap down, without destroying 2 5      the blood supply, because that will heal back up.
	Page   2148
 1              Q.   All right. Let's go back to the record,
 2       please.
 3                    The surgeon's name was Dr. Jordan Grabel,
 4       at Good Samaritan in West Palm Beach, Florida. Right
 5       parietal brain tumor. We looked at that record. And
 6       the cc'g physician is Neal Rothschild.
 7                    Let's go down. The patient was
 8       positioned for surgery in the right side up, park
 9       bench position. All bony prominences were well
 i o      padded. The head was placed in the Gardner skull
 11       clamps.
 12                    They have to clamp your head down to keep
 13       it straight, right?
 14              A.    Correct.
 15              Q.   And the head was fixed firmly to the
 16       operating room table in standard fashion. The head
 17       was shaved and prepped in the usual manner. Sterile
 18       drapes were applied in the usual fashion.
 19                    All normal preoperative stuff before you 2 o     cut open the head, right?
 21              A.    Correct.
 22              Q.   Now let's go to Page 2, please.
 2 3                  Again, an ultrasound was performed
 2 4      confirming tumor location. What does that mean?
 2 5            A.   Well, it just gives them a better idea

1       where -- where they're going to make the incision in

2       the brain. They don't want to--they don't want to

3       interrupt any more of the brain tissue than they have

4       tO.

5               Q.    Okay. The "pia arachnoid," what's that?

6               A.    That's one of the -- one of the meninges.

7       That's the covering of the brain.

8               Q.    You can't answer a question of what's

9      that if it's something else that nobody knows what it io      is.

n                     So what's the meninges?

12               A.    Well, it's the covering of the brain.

13       There are -- there are several layers of the covering

14       of the brain that protect it.

15               Q.   "Was coagulated," what does that mean?

16               A.    Well, that means it was -- when the --

17       the blood -- when the --

18                     When it was opened, they -- they would

19       use some type of cautery to make sure the blood -- the 2 o       blood vessels were -- were clotted off.

21               Q.    And then a corticotomy was made,

2 2       dissection was performed down to the tumor. 2 3                     So they cut all the way down to the

2 4       tumor, right? 2 5               A.    Correct.

Page   2150

1              Q.   The Buddy halo self-retractor system was

2       used for retraction.

3                    That's just the instrument?

4              A.    That's just to pull back the--the

5       covering of the brain.

6              Q.    Dropping down here, the margins were then

7       removed piecemeal.

8                    What does that term mean, the margins

9       were removed piecemeal?

10              A.    Well, you can see the - the tumor and

11       the normal brain tissue, and so they go out to the

12       margins of that. And some ~ some tumors will be able

13       to be able to just be kind of shelled out, like

14       shelling out a pea out of a peapod.

15                     But this one was more adherent to the

16       brain tissue, so they had to move it out piecemeal,

17       little bits at a time, until they got completely

18       around the margins of the cancer.

19              Q.    During the final stages of tumor removal,

2 0       specimens at the tumor boundary showed a mixture of

21       brain tissue with tumor elements.

2 2                    What does that mean?

2 3              A.   Well, they were unable to get around the

2 4       entire cancer. They - they knew they were going to

2 5       leave some cancer behind.

Page   2151

1              Q.    Did they, essentially, have to chip away

2       at his brain to get as much cancer as possible out?

3               A.    That's correct.

4              Q.   Okay. And this is the end stage of

5       tobacco-related lung cancer, right?

8                     THE COURT: Sustained.

9              Q.   Have you seen patients in your practice

1 o       who smoked for a number of years and this is where

11       they end up?

12               A.    Correct.

13              Q.   Now, after they took out the tissue they

14       got from the brain, did they send that to a

15       pathologist?

16               A.    They did.

17              Q.    Okay. And I'm going to represent to you

18       that the tobacco companies in this case do not accept

19       the idea that Mr. Perrotto's cancer in his brain came

2 0       from his lung? Can you -

21                     MR. COFER: Objection, Your Honor. May

22               we approach?

6               ask the question.

7                     THE COURT: Sustain the objection. I'll

8               give a curative, as well ~

9                      MR. COFER: Thank you, Your Honor.

10                     THE COURT: --to disregard it.

11                      MR. GDANSKI: It's true. It's true.

12                     THE COURT: I understand, but we don't do

13               it that way; okay? Thank you. All right.

23       BY MR. GDANSKI:

2 4               Q.    The point is that after they took out the

2 5       tumor from his brain, did they send it to a

1       pathologist in Good Samaritan Hospital?

2              A.    They did.

3              Q.   Okay. Now, is this the same hospital

4       where he had his right upper lung taken out four years

5       earlier, basically?

6              A.    Correct.

7              Q.   So let's take a look at the pathology

8       report, Number 42, from Good Samaritan Hospital.

9                    So this is now signed by a doctor named

1 o       Harvey Cove. Do you see that?

11              A.    Yes.

12              Q.    At Good Samaritan Hospital, Flagler

13       Street in Palm Beach. And let's just talk about "A"

14       through "F" first. Let's not get to the note just

15       yet.

16                    So what is "A" through "F"? What is that

17       referring to?

18                    We can go back a page, if you want.

19       Let's go back to Page 41, please.

2 o                    All right. So this is the first page of

21       the pathology report. So what - what are we -2 2                    Explain to the jury what we see here.

2 3       There's specimens A, B, C, D, E, F, and then there's

2 4       descriptions A, B, C, D, E, F. What does all that

2 5       mean?

Page   2154

1              A.    Well, those are just different sections

2       that they presented to the pathology lab. So bits and

3       pieces of the cancer were sent and labeled when they

4       were taken to the pathology lab.

5              Q.   Okay.

6              A.    And then the gross description just

7       describes what they received. This is just a way of

8       identifying what -- what pieces are being talked about

9       when they interpreted it.

io              Q.   And after you do a gross description,

11       does the pathologist look at the tissue from "A"

12       through "F," so all of the tissue that's taken out,

13       under a microscope and render a final diagnosis?

14              A.    They do.

15              Q.   Okay. Let's go ahead now back to that

16       second page, so we can put "A" through "F" in context.

17                   And just blow up the first paragraph,

18       please. Thank you.

19                   So it's Diagnosis "A" through "F."

2 o                    Papillary adenocarcinoma, what does that

21       mean?

2 2              A.    Well, it's just-

2 3                    An adenocarcinoma can have different

2 4       features; and "papillary" just means it has little

2 5       projections that look like papules.

Page   2155

1              Q.   Probably metastatic papillary

2       adenocarcinoma from known primary adenocarcinoma of

3       lung. Do you see that?

4              A.    Yes.

5              Q.   What does that mean?

6              A.    Well, that's just the assessment --

7       overall assessment of what the -- the slides show; and

8       then they referenced it to his previous history.

9              Q.   Okay. And did this physician, Dr. Cove,

10       back in 1996, conclude that Mr. Perrotto probably had

11       metastatic adenocarcinoma of his brain from known

12       primary adenocarcinoma of lung?

13              A.    That's correct.

14             Q.   Now, then he says "see note." Now let's

15       go to the yellow section.

16                   So after he renders that diagnosis, what

17       did he do?

18              A.    Well, he -- he goes through and actually

19       looks back at the previous material because of this 2 o       likely representing a metastasis.

21              Q.   Okay. He actually went back, he went

2 2       into the drawer at the pathology department and pulled

2 3       out the old 1992 specimen; right?

2 4                    MR. COFER: Objection; lack of

2 5              foundation, complete speculation.

1                     THE COURT: Sustained.

2              Q.    Let's see what he wrote. In view of the

3       focal papillary features seen in this patient's prior

4       lung primary adenocarcinoma. Okay?

5              A.    Yes.

6              Q.   So, although otherwise not identical, the

7       present material most likely represents a metastasis.

8       Can you tell us what that sentence means, please?

9              A.    Well, this pathologist went and compared

10       the tissue from before, from the lung specimen to the

11       current specimen, to see if it matched up.

12              Q.   Okay. And did it match up?

13              A.    He says it did. Though it's not

14       identical, it most likely represents a metastasis.

15              Q.   Okay. And although other lesions are

16       considered in the differential diagnosis, including a

17       choroid plexus tumor, they are radiologically

18       incompatible and lack communication to the ventricle.

19                    So after he says it matches up, he says

20       he might consider this, but there's no -

21                     MR. COFER: Objection; leading, 2 2             argumentative.

2 3              Q.   What does that-

2 4                     THE COURT: Sustained.

 1      handwritten physician orders note?
 2             A.    Correct.
 3             Q.   Okay. So-
4                  And just tell us what we see here
 5      highlighted. What did they put him on? What kind of
 6      drugs?
 7             A.    Well, a lot of them.
 8                   Decadron is a drug that's a steroid.
 9      It's -- and it's, in this case, administered
 10      intravenously, and it's used to keep the brain from
 11      swelling after the surgery.
 12                   Dilantin is there to decrease the chances
 13      of a seizure. Demerol is for pain. Zantac is for
 14      esophagitis or -- or gastritis.
 15                   The three -- three main ones, 1 guess,
 16      were the ones that are highlighted.
 17             Q.   Okay. Decadron is a narcotic?
 18             A.    No; Decadron is a steroid.
 19             Q.   Sorry, 1 meant Demerol.
 2 0             A.    Demerol is a narcotic, yes.
 21            Q.   Okay. And what are the-
2 2                 What is a well-known side effect of
 2 3      narcotics? What are they?
 2 4             A.    Well, they can make you feel drowsy, they
 2 5      can make you feel sleepy, they can cause other
	Page   2163
 1      constipation. It's where the -- it's where the colon
 2      twists on itself and, basically, obstructs itself by
 3      twisting. That's what a volvulus is.
 4             Q.    And let's go to -
5                   Procedure performed was a colonoscopy.
 6      Preoperative diagnosis was a reduction of sigmoid
 7      volvulus. And if you go to the second page, the
 8      impression was reduction of sigmoid volvulus.
 9                   Do you see that? 10            A.    Ido.
 n            Q.    Okay. And can one get that from
 12      constipation caused by high doses of narcotics?
 13             A.    That's most likely the cause, yes.
 14             Q.    In the case of Mr. Perrotto, why did he
 15      most likely, to a high degree of medical certainty,
 16      develop a sigmoid volvulus?
 17             A.    Because of his medications; mainly, the
 18      narcotics.
 19             Q.    Narcotics to treat what condition, sir? 2 0            A.    Narcotics to treat the pain that he was
 21      having probably from the post -- postoperative part of
 2 2      his craniotomy, but also probably for just general
 2 3      pain in general.
 2 4            Q.    If Mr. Perrotto never had lung cancer,
 2 5     okay, so he didn't get the lung cancer, he never had

Page   2162
 1      systemic things like constipation.
 2             Q.   And did you see that after Mr. Perrotto
 3       had his surgery and was placed on high doses of
 4      narcotics, he complained of constipation?
 5             A.    He did.
 6             Q.    Is there anything odd about that?
 7             A.    No.
 8             Q.   Did he ultimately have a colonoscopy
 9      performed?
 10            A.    He did.
 li            Q.   What's a colonoscopy?
 12             A.    It's where they put a tube in through the
 13       rectum, looking for an abnormality that occurred.
 14             Q.   All right. Let's go to 31, please. I'm
 15      sorry, Good Samaritan Record 31.
 16                   And the colonoscopy is performed - date
 17      of procedure is 8/23/96, reduction of sigmoid
 18      volvulus.
 19                   What is a sigmoid volvulus?
 2 0            A.    The sigmoid colon is the lower part of
 21      the colon that leads to the rectum. It's called
 22      sigmoid because it's kind of S-shaped. And so, in 2 3     older people, which he was not older in the usual
 2 4     sense, but he was old enough to be at higher risk for 2 5      a sigmoid volvulus, but the main risk was his
	Page   2164
 1      lung cancer, would he have had a sigmoid volvulus when
 2      he had it?
 3            A.    Highly unlikely.
 4            Q.   And is that an opinion you have to a
 5      reasonable and high degree of certainty?
 6            A.    Yes.
 7            Q.   And you see that the physician is Sidney
 8      Neimark who performed the colonoscopy, right?
 9            A.    Yes.
 io            Q.   Okay. So then, after the colonoscopy,
 11      what happened?
 12            A.    Well, he--he continued to have
 13      abdominal discomfort. This is ~
 14                  When they relieved this, they relieved
 15      the pressure, is what they do, when they -- when they
 16      do the colonoscopy, to clear out the -- the volvulus,
 17      then they relieve the pressure, and then that -- that
 18      makes his abdominal distention, abdominal pain, go
 19      down.
 2 0            Q.   Okay. And did he start to complain of
 21      increased pain?
 2 2             A.    He did.
 2 3            Q.   Okay. Let's take a look at an abdominal
 2 4      x-ray, Good Samaritan 83.

	Mr. Perrotto was complaining of pain after he had a

	treatment, the chemotherapy and radiation therapy,

2
	colonoscopy?
	2
	adds a layer of complexity, and then the medications

3
	A.    Well, he had a pneumoperitoneum, which

	on top of that add a whole different layer of

4
	means he had air in the -- in the abdominal cavity,
	4
	complexity.

5
	which usually means he had a perforation of the colon.
	5
	Q.   All those layers of complexity that you

6
	Q.   Now, can you tell the jury what a

	just mentioned - so the pain, other cancers, the

7
	perforation of the colon means, please?

8
	A.    Well, a "perforation" means that the --

	have had any of those additional layers of complexity

9
	The colon is a tube, basically, and it
	9
	if he just never had lung cancer?

10
	perforates and it makes a little opening, which spills
	10
	A.    No.

12

14
	would he have developed a perforated colon in August
	14
	A.    Yes.

15

16
	A.    Absolutely not.

	During the past 24 hours, the patient has become toxic

22
	A.    No.

	and septic.

23
	Q.   So this is an ominous finding, right?
	23
	What does that mean?

24
	A.    It is. And lung cancer patients
	24
	A.    Well, "toxic" means he just really looks

25
	sometimes end up dying from a lot of -- a lot of

	What does that mean?

6

	11
	Let's blow up the impression, please.

12
	there's so many different factors that go into the

14
	Q.    Do lung cancer -
	14
	post craniotomy on August 19, '96.

15
	You know, do patients always die a clean
	15
	That's what we talked about, right?

16
	death, where you know exactly what's going on?
	16
	A.    That's correct.

17
	A.    No.
	17
	Q.   Multiple perforations of the sigmoid

18
	Q.   Okay. So how does that work with cancer
	18
	colon status post laparotomy and sigmoidoscopy on

19
	patients?
	19
	August 26th, '96?

20
	A.    Well, it's very complicated because they
	20
	A.    Correct.

21
	have so many different things going on and so many
	21
	Q.   Abdominal abscess, septic shock; right?

22
	different medications.
	22
	A.    That's what it says.

23
	So the cancer is one problem. He had --
	23
	Q.   Now, when you have -

24
	probably had cancer in other places that we don't know
	24
	Have you written - have you written

25
	about as yet, just given his history. But then the
	25
	medical records in the past? I'm sure you have,

2
	A.    Say again.
	2
	you're lucky enough to make it out, you get

5
	Q.   Okay. And consult notes?
	5
	A.    Yes.

6
	A.    Yes.
	6
	Q.   And if you don't make it out, you get an

7
	Q.   And when you have to write an impression,
	7
	expiration summary?

8
	what's the - you know, the numbering system? How
	8
	A.    Correct.

9
	does that work?
	9
	Q.   So you saw that Dr. Rothschild, Neal

10
	A.    Well, you just kind of take it from the
	10
	Rothschild, the same physician who cared for him,

11
	beginning to wherever you are, and that's what he did
	11
	prescribed his initial chemotherapy, worked with him

12
	here.
	12
	throughout, he's the one who wrote his expiration

13
	Q.   And so looking at a record like this,
	13
	summary; right?

14
	what can you glean as a medical doctor as to this
	14
	A.    That's correct.

15

	16
	Samaritan Number - Bates Number 5.

17
	A.    It goes from one to five. It's just
	17
	But, for Danny, it's Number 4.

18
	those -- that's the sequence of events that occurred
	18
	So Mr. Perrotto now has passed away in

19
	in this patient.
	19
	Good Samaritan Hospital, and Dr. Rothschild has the

20
	Q.   And so according to this medical record,
	20
	medical obligation to chart what took place; right?

21
	made in the hospital of Nick Perrotto, Dr. Krisko
	21
	A.    Correct.

22
	notes that he had a lung cancer which metastasized to
	22
	Q.   And he says: Reason for admission.

23
	the brain, for which he had a craniotomy, afterwards
	23
	Reason for admission, seizures caused by what?

24
	there are multiple perforations of the colon, then he
	24
	A.    Seizures; and Number 2 is metastatic lung

25
	had a laparotomy, which caused abscess, which caused
	25
	cancer to the brain.

	Q.   Is there any hesitation in

	A.    That's correct.

	Dr. Rothschild's final note as to where the cancer in

3
	Q.    Okay. And is that absolutely what

	Mr. Perrotto's brain came from?

4
	happened to Mr. Perrotto?
	4
	MR. COFER: Objection.

	Q.   Is this note crystal clear that

	the sequence of events. He had something else happen.
	7
	Mr. Perrotto's cancer in his brain came from his lung?

8
	Q.    Okay. In the con-
	8
	MR. COFER: Same objection.

9
	Fair enough. In the context of this
	9
	THE COURT: Sustained.

10
	case, did the lung cancer cause the brain metastasis,
	10
	Q.   What did Dr. Rothschild conclude?

11
	which ultimately caused the volvulus, which caused
	11
	A.    The reason for admission was seizures;

12
	perforations, caused abscess, which caused septic
	12
	and that was resulting from metastatic lung cancer to

13
	shock?
	13
	the brain.

14
	A.    That's the sequence of events, yes.
	14
	Q.   Is that the conclusion he reached 15

15
	Q.    Is that exactly what's noted in the
	15
	years ago down the street?

16
	medical records?
	16
	A.    Say again.

17
	A.    It is.
	17
	Q.   Is that the conclusion he reached 15,14

18
	Q.   All right. So Mr. Perrotto, he - he did
	18
	years ago down the street, at Good Samaritan Hospital,

19
	not survive this admission, did he?
	19
	that it came from the lung to the brain?

20
	A.    He did not.
	20
	A.    I didn't understand that.

21
	Q.   And when a patient dies during an
	21
	Q.   Don't worry about it. It's fine.

22
	admission to a hospital, is there something called an

	Let's take that down one second, Danny,

23
	expiration summary done?
	23
	put up the whole page. Thank you.

24
	A.    It's called different things in different

1       Mr. Perrotto's medical course, starting from the

2       beginning, first line, the patient is a

3       fifty-six-year-old white male who was originally

4       diagnosed with locally advanced non-small cell

5       carcinoma of the right upper lobe in the fall of

6       '92 -

7                     Does he start all the way at the

8       beginning and take everybody through his entire

9       medical course?

10               A.    That's the history of the present n       illness, yes.

12               Q.    Okay. He ends up at the bottom of that

13       paragraph by saying he had a grand mal seizure with a

14       four-centimeter right parieto-occipital lesion

15       consistent with metastatic disease; right?

16               A.    Correct.

17               Q.    Now - and let's just go to the final

18       diagnosis, please. That's Page Number 6.

19                     What did Dr. Rothschild note as 2 o       Mr. Perrotto's final diagnosis?

21                     Now, this is after he's died; right?

2 2               A.    That's correct.

2 3               Q.    Okay. What is the Number 1 diagnosis

2 4       Dr. Rothschild writes at Good Samaritan Hospital on

2 5       September 4th, 1996, relating to Mr. Perrotto?

Page   2174

1                A.    Lung cancer, metastatic to brain.

2                Q.   What's after that?

3                A.    A misspelling. It should be volvulus,

4        V-O, of the intestine.

5                Q.   Volvulus of the intestine.

6                       After that is what?

7                A.    Perforation of the intestine.

8                Q.    After that is what?

9              A.    Septic shock.

io                Q.   Okay. So going back -

11                        MR. COFER: I'm sorry, keep reading

12                what's after that.

13                Q.    After that is chronic obstructive

14        pulmonary disease, right, COPD?

15                A.    Correct, sure.

16                Q.    Okay. And so could Dr. Rothschild have

17       written "volvulus" before "lung cancer"?

18                A.     No.

19                Q.    Why not?

2 0                A.    Because the lung cancer led to the train

21        of events that ended up in his demise, and that's

22        the--that's the number one cause.

2 3                Q.    All right. Now, Dr. Rothschild also

2 4        signed Nick Perrotto's death certificate; right? 2 5                A.    Yes.

Page   2175

1               Q.    Let's take a look at that. Do you have

2       that?

3                     And here he puts under the -

4                     Let's blow up the bottom. Let's blow up

5       the whole thing, the bottom and the whole section

6       underneath this. That's good. Thank you.

7                     So it says: Enter disease or diseases or

8       complications that cause the death. Do not enter the

9       mode of dying such as cardiac or respiratory illness,

1 o       shock or heart disease. Only enter one cause on each li       line.

12                     He puts "peritonitis." What is that?

13               A.    Well, that's where the perforation of the

14       bowel took place and spread the bacteria from the

15       bowel into the inside of the abdomen.

16               Q.    Due to or as a consequence of - due to

17       or as a consequence of ischemic bowel; right?

18               A.    Yes.

19               Q.   What's that?

2 0               A.    Well, that's where the bowel is ~ is 21       dying. And so that --

2 2                      "Ischemic" means just lack of blood flow.

2 3               Q.   And he puts other significant conditions

2 4       contributing to death not resulting in underlying

2 5       cause given on Part 1 -

3                     MR. GDANSKI: Sure.

4              Q.   - not resulting in underlying cause

5       given on Part 1, lung cancer metastatic to brain;

6       right?

7               A.    That's correct.

8              Q.   Okay. Dr. Hurt, as a physician who's

9       reviewed this entire medical file, if Mr. Perrotto did

1 o       not have lung cancer, would he have died when he died?

11               A.    No.

12              Q.   If Mr. Perrotto did not have lung cancer,

13       would he have died in the manner that he died?

14                     MR. COFER: Object to the form.

15                     THE COURT: Sustained.

16              Q.   Do you have an opinion to a reasonable

17       degree of medical probability as to whether or not

18       lung cancer was a cause of Mr. Perrotto's death?

19               A.    It was ~ it was the initiating event

2 o       that led to the chain of events and led ~ led to his

21       ultimate demise, yes.

22              Q.   Okay. And do you hold that opinion to a 2 3       high degree of medical probability?

2 4               A.    I do.

2 5              Q.   Okay. But for lung cancer, would

1       Mr. Perrotto be alive today?

2                      MR. COFER: Object --

3               A.    Most likely.

4                      MR. COFER: Object to the form.

5                      THE COURT: Sustained.

6               Q.    If Mr. Perrotto didn't have lung cancer,

7       do you have an opinion to a reasonable degree of

8       medical probability as to whether or not he would be

9      alive today?

10             A.    Most likely he would be, yes.

li              Q.    Now, you say that the lung cancer was the

12       initiating factor in his death. Can you go ahead and

13       remind the jury, please, what was the initiating

14       factor in his lung cancer?

15               A.    His smoking.

16               Q.   All right. What was the initiating

17       factor in his smoking?

18               A.    Being addicted.

19               Q.   All right. Thank you.

2 o                     Now, I want to circle back. We've now

21       walked through his addiction - his medical course in

2 2       the hospital. I want to circle back and talk a little

2 3       bit about a couple of other things we talked about on

2 4       Friday. Okay?

2 5               A.    Okay.

Page   2178

1               Q.   Can addicted smokers stop smoking?

2               A.    Can addicted smokers stop? Yes.

3               Q.   So does that mean that they're not

4       addicted?

5               A.     No.

6               Q.    All right. Why not?

7               A.    Well, because addicted smokers can stop

8       smoking. We know -- we know that. And particularly

9       with good treatment, they can stop smoking at a higher

1 o      rate.

n               Q.   What percentage of all cancers are caused

12       by tobacco?

13               A.    About 30 percent.

14               Q.   And so what does that mean as to, you

15       know, the scale of cancer in this country?

16                      MR. COFER: Objection, Your Honor.

17                      THE COURT: Sustained.

18               Q.    If 30 percent of cancers are caused by

19       cigarette smoke, what would be the result if there

2 o       were no cancers caused by cigarette smoke in this 21       country?

2 2                      MR. COFER: Objection, Your Honor,

23               Williams/State Farm; 401, 403.

2 4                      THE COURT: Overruled.

2 5               Q.   Go ahead, sir. You can answer.

Page   2179

1               A.    Well, the easiest way to answer it is it

2       causes 30 percent of all the cancers. Without

3       tobacco-caused cancers, we would be, basically,

4       winning the war on cancer, because the rates of cancer

5       are going down in almost all other subtypes.

6               Q.   And what's the success rate in your

7       residential program? In the Mayo residential program,

8       what's the success rate in smoking cessation?

9              A.    For our residential program, which is an

10       eight-day program, very intensive, it's 52 percent at

11       one year.

12               Q.    One of the tests you mentioned on Friday

13       was called the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine

14       Dependence. You said it's really not meant to be used

15       with someone if they're not here. Remember that?

16               A.    Correct.

17               Q.    But did you still apply it to

18       Mr. Perrotto?

19              A.    Well, you can, and you can also apply 2 o       other ~ other diagnostic criteria, too, if you have 21       enough ~ enough evidence.

2 2               Q.   All right. And let's just take a look at

2 3       that Fagerstrom test for a moment, please. 2 4              A.    Okay.

2 5               Q.    So just-

1                      The first question is: How soon after

2       you wake up do you smoke your first cigarette?

3                      What do we know about Mr. Perrotto in

4       that regard?

5               A.    He would be within five minutes.

6               Q.    Okay. So he would get three points.

7                      Do you find it difficult to refrain from

8       smoking in places where it's forbidden?

9                   What do we know about Mr. Perrotto in i o      that regard?

li             A.    Well, in the depositions, he reported to

12       have left movies or church to go out to smoke.

13               Q.    Okay. So he gets another point.

14                      Now, I want to back up to Question

15       Number 1. We talked about it on Friday a little bit.

16                      Why is this question, how soon you wake

17       up (sic) after you smoke (sic) your first cigarette,

18       why is that critically important in the context of

19       assessing and determining that Nick was addicted? 2 0               A.    Well, overnight, the nicotine levels in

21       the blood go down. So then, in the morning, the

2 2       nicotine levels are approaching zero. And remember,

2 3       all the brain receptors we talked about earlier, if

2 4       there's a lot of them, if there are billions of them,

2 5       they want to get the effect of nicotine as soon as

 1      they can. So that --
2                   It really is tied to the neurobiology of
 3      this, as far as how soon a person has their first
 4      cigarette in the morning, and that's -- that's why
 5      this is really important.
 6             Q.   All right. And let's go to Number 2.
 7      What's the importance of not having the ability to
 8      refrain from smoking in places -
9             A.    Same --
io            Q.   - where it's forbidden? li             A.    Same thing. It would-
12                   Even just a half an hour or an hour, the
 13      blood levels of nicotine begin to go down, and
 14      certainly within an hour and a half or so, they go
 15      down; and, again, that produces the urge to smoke, and
 16      having to go out -- outside and have a cigarette.
 17             Q.   Okay. Let's goto--
18                  So he would get another point there.
 19      That's four. Let's go down.
 2 o                 What cigarette would you hate most to
 21      give up, could we learn that without having
 2 2      Mr. Perrotto here to tell us?
 2 3             A.    No. We would have to talk to him.
 2 4            Q.   Okay. Number 4, how many cigarettes a
 2 5     day do you smoke?
	Page   2183
 1      Dependence score Mr. Perrotto based on the information
 2      we have available?
 3            A.    He would be in the very high dependence
 4      level.
 5            Q.    Let's take a look at PT01809. 01809.
 6      And these documents are in evidence. We moved them
 7      into evidence outside the presence of the jury, so we
 8      can skip a few.
 9                 This is from Philip Morris USA. Do you
 1 o      recognize that? n             A.    Yes.
 12            Q.    It says: First, every undertaking has to
 13      have some mission. 1 would state our charter from
 14      Philip Morris in this fashion: Study the psychology
 15      of the smoker in search of information that can
 16      increase what?
 17                 Corporate profits?
 18            A.    Corporate profits.
 19            Q.   Did they study and successfully figure
 2 o      out the psychology of the smoker so as to increase 21      corporate profits?
 2 2                  MR. COFER: Objection; leading, lack of
 2 3             foundation.
 2 4                  THE COURT: Sustained.
 2 5            Q.   Did they do that?

Page   2182
 1                  You said there's 20 in a pack, and he
 2      smoked between two to three packs.
 3            A.    He would be in the 31 or more category.
 4            Q.    So now he's got three more points.
 5      That's seven.
 6                  Let's go to Number 5. Do you smoke more
 7      frequently during the first hours after awakening than
 8      during the rest of the day?
 9                  Can we figure that answer out without him i o      being here to tell us?
 11            A.    No.
 12            Q.    Okay. Number 5.
 13                  And then Number 6, do you smoke even if
 14      you were so ill that you're in bed most of the day,
 15      what do we know about that?
 16            A.   Well, he was reported to have done that
 17      on occasion, when he would be too sick, be sick
 18      enough, that he would continue to smoke even though he
 19      was sick.
 2 0            Q.    Okay. So he gets three points to the 21      first question, one to the second question. That's 2 2      four. He gets three points to the fourth question. 2 3      That's seven. He gets one point to the sixth 2 4      question. That's eight. 2 5                  How does the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine
	Page   2184
 1             A.    Yes.
 2             Q.   Okay. Were they successful at it?
 3             A.    Absolutely.
 4             Q.    For many years?
 5             A.    Decades.
 6             Q.   Was Nick Perrotto - did he ultimately
 7      fall as a result of his continued smoking?
 8             A.    Say again.
 9             Q.    Did he ultimately die as a result of his 10     continued smoking?
 n            A.    He did.
 12             Q.    Now let's go to Number 3, Page 3.
 13                   There are some distinctive features -
14                   This is from Philip Morris, right?
 15             A.    It is.
 16             Q.   There are some distinctive features about
 17      the cigarette market. We sell a product that is
 18      bought often and used from ten to 60 times a day,
 19      day-in, day-out. We provide a product that is the 2 o     essential commodity in a habitual act.
 21                 Let's drop down. I'm trying to go fast.
 2 2     Sorry, Susan.
 2 3                 You're all familiar with Pavlov's dog.
 2 4     Present a dog food, he salivates. Ring a bell each
 2 5     time you present the food, and in due time you can

 i      ring the bell without the food and he will salivate.
 2                    Put a hungry rat in a cage, pull a
 3       lever - put a lever in the cage, make it so that a
 4       push on the lever delivers a pellet of food. In its
 5       random movements, the rat will push the lever, he'll
 6       get the pellet, the rat will soon associate
 7       lever-pushing with food pellet. In time, he will be
 8       rapidly pushing the lever for food.
 9                   And now they say -
1 o                 They switched from rats to smokers,
 11       right?
 12              A.    Correct.
 13              Q.   Consider the smoker: Smoking the
 14       cigarette is the lever press. The effect of that
 15       smoking act upon his person is the reward. The reward
 16       reinforces the smoking act. He comes to push the
 17       lever ten to 60 times -
18                   Sixty times, that's three packs a day;
 19       right?
 2 0             A.    Correct.
 21              Q.   Okay. Ten to 60 times per day. Our task
 22       is to understand the reinforcing mechanism, or 2 3     process, whereby the habit is established and
 2 4      maintained. Such is our model. Conceptually simple 2 5      on the surface, but the complexities lurk in numbers

 1       know, 1953, did the industry have the ability to
 2       manufacture cigarettes that did not contain nicotine?
 3              A.    They did.
 4              Q.   And if they would have, in 1953, said, we
 5       are not going to sell cigarettes that contain
 6       nicotine, would Nick Perrotto have died in 1996?
 7              A.    No.
 8              Q.   Would he be here today?
 9              A.    Likely.
 io            Q.    Let's go to PT01153.
 11                    Philip Morris USA, Some Comments About
 12       the CTR Program.
 13                    The jury is going to hear all about CTR.
 14       Tell them what it stands for.
 15              A.    Council for Tobacco Research.
 16              Q.   Okay. 1 was amazed at the trend that the
 17       CTR work is taking. For openers, Dr. Donald H. Ford,
 18       a new staff member, makes the following quotes:
 19       Opiates and nicotine may be similar in action. We 2 o      accept the fact that nicotine is habituating. There 21     is a relationship between nicotine and the opiates. 2 2                 And just put this document into context.
 2 3      Is this an internal - internal private document?
 2 4             A.    It is.
 2 5           Q.   Okay. It's marked at the top "personal

Page   2186
 1       beneath the surface.
 2                     Right?
 3               A.    Correct.
 4               Q.    He then says -
5                     Let's go to Page Number 5. This is still
 6       Philip Morris.
 7                     Without the chemical compound, the
 8       cigarette market would collapse, PM would collapse,
 9       and we'd all lose our jobs and our consulting fees. 10                  Right?
 li             A.    That's correct.
 12               Q.    No nicotine, no Philip Morris, no
 13       consulting fees, no jobs; right?
 14               A.    That's what it says.
 15               Q.    No nicotine, no Nick Perrotto dying,
 16       right? To put it simple, right?
 17               A.    Nicotine is the driving force --
18                      MR. COFER: Objection, Your Honor.
 19               A.    - behind the addiction.
 2 0                  THE COURT: Sustain the objection.
 21               Disregard the last question and answer.
 22               Q.   If the nicotine was not in cigarettes, 2 3     would Mr. Perrotto have died when he died? 2 4              A.     No.
 2 5            Q.    Okay. Now, going back one thing. You

 1       and confidential," right?
 2              A.    Correct.
 3              Q.   Okay. So those statements by Mr. Ford,
 4       by Dr. Ford, they were within the confines of the
 5       industry; right?
 6              A.    That's correct.
 7              Q.   Okay. Then, on the bottom, Mr. Osdene
 8       from Philip Morris writes: It is my strong feeling
 9       that with the progress that has been claimed, we are io      in the business - we are in the process of digging
 11       our own grave. 1 believe that the program as set up
 12       has the potential of great damage to the industry.
 13                    Do you see that?
 14              A.    That's correct.
 15              Q.   And why -
16                   Why is it, Dr. Hurt, as someone who
 17       spends his life doing this, that the information being
 18       put out by the industry would have been impactful,
 19       would have made a difference? Why would it have made
 20       a difference if they would have come out with this
 21       information?
 2 2                   MR. COFER: Objection; lack of
 2 3            foundation, calls for speculation.
 2 4                  THE COURT: Sustained.
 2 5            Q.   Okay. As someone who's treated smokers

34    (Pages   2189   to   2192)

Page   2189

1       and studied both the public information regarding

2       smoking and health, and as a physician who's done

3       that, and also looked at the internal knowledge where

4       research was discussed and ultimately not moved

5       forward with, why would the research that the industry

6       could have come out with, why would that have been

7       important to smoking behavior?

8                     MR. COFER: Same argument. And, Your

9              Honor, may we approach?

10                    THE COURT: Sure. Counsel, sidebar,

11              please.

12                     (The following discussion was held at

13              sidebar:)

14                     MR. COFER: At this point, the answer is

15              just all argument. He's, essentially, just

16              asking the doctor to make a closing argument.

17              He's made all the points, he's showed the

18              documents, and it is complete speculation. We

19              have no idea what would happen. It's counter

20              factual.

21                     MR. GDANSKI: I think he has an opinion

22              based on his--

23                    THE COURT: Based upon what?

2 4                     MR. GDANSKI: Based upon his studying the

2 5              documents, and what did take place when they

Page   2190

1               came out. Smoking rates dropped.

2                     THE COURT: You can talk about his

3               foundation and knowledge of what took place,

4               but not about this --

5                     MR. GDANSKI: Sure, I'll lay the

6               foundation.

7                     MR. COFER: But he can't say, here's what

8               would have happened.

9                   THE COURT: Yeah, you need to lay the io             foundation.

11                     MR. GDANSKI: I'll lay the foundation.

12                     THE COURT: Mr. Gdanski, how much longer

13               on-

14                     MR. GDANSKI: Five minutes. I'm

15               skipping. I'm about-

16                     THE COURT: Perfect timing. Okay.

17                    (Sidebar discussion was concluded, and the

18               following was held in open court:)

19                     THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, we have 2 0               a few more minutes and Mr. Gdanski is going to

21               wrap up direct.

22                     So the objection to the last question was 2 3               sustained.

2 4       BY MR. GDANSKI:

2 5              Q.    Doctor, what ultimately happened?

Page   2191

1                     You know, there will be another witness

2       who will discuss when certain things were

3       admissions - were admitted, but did it ultimately

4       make a difference in the smoking behavior and public

5       health community when the information from the

6       industry, from the private documents, did come out?

7       Did it make a difference?

8               A.    It made a huge difference. In fact,

9      that's the legacy of what happened in 1998. io              Q.   Okay. Would it have made a similar

11       difference if it had happened decades earlier?

12                     MR. COFER: Same objection. Speculation,

13               lack of foundation.

14                     THE COURT: Sustained.

15              Q.    Is there any reason to think that it

16       would not have made a similar difference if it

17       happened earlier?

18                     MR. COFER: Your Honor, same objection.

19                     THE COURT: Sustained.

2 0                     MR. GDANSKI: Can you just put up

21               Slide 55, please, Danny? Number 55, this one.

2 2              Q.    Can you just tell us real quickly,

2 3       Dr. Hurt, what - how many doses of nicotine

2 4       Mr. Perrotto had throughout his life?

2 5               A.    Well, you can calculate it. It would be

Page   2192

1       millions, because he smoked three packs a day; and so

2       every -- every cigarette would be a dose, but every

3       puff is actually a dose.

4              Q.   Okay. So, doing the math, if he smoked

5       two to three packs per day for 40 years, at two packs

6       it's 14,600 cigarettes a year. Do you see that?

7               A.    Yes.

8              Q.   And at three packs, it's 21,900

9       cigarettes per year? 10               A.    Correct.

n              Q.   And is the medical knowledge such that

12       it's ten puffs per cigarette on average?

13               A.    That's correct.

14              Q.   Okay. So if he smoked two - two packs a

15       day, he has 5,840,000 hits of nicotine in his life to

16       his brain; right?

17               A.    Correct.

18              Q.   And if he smoked three packs a day, he

19       has 8,760,000 lifetime hits of nicotine to his brain; 2 o       right?

21               A.    Correct.

2 2              Q.    Let's go to PT1820, 01820.

2 3                     This is called the Nordine Study by

2 4       Dr. Teague. And he says: Most of those who have

2 5       smoked for any significant time would like to stop.

 1      Many, but not most, of those who would like to stop
 2      smoking are able to do so.
 3                 Do you see that?
 4            A.    1 do.
 5            Q.   All right. And so go to Page 2, please.
 6                 Dr. Teague writes: However, we cannot
 7      ever be comfortable selling a product which most of
 8      our customers would stop using if they could. That is
 9      to say, if the exit gate from our market should
 i o     suddenly open, we could be out of business almost
 11      overnight. If/when that occurs, our options include,
 12      A, go out of business.
 13                 That's been an option to them, right?
 14            A.    Correct.
 15            Q.   Two, find a way to eliminate the desire
 16      of smokers to stop smoking.
 17                 And when they came out with the
 18      nicotine-free cigarettes, nobody bought them; right?
 19            A.    That's correct.
 20            Q.   Let's go to Page 3. This is, again,
 21      Dr. Teague. And he says: We cannot be comfortable
 2 2      marketing a product which most of our customers would
 2 3      do without if they could.
 2 4                 Dr. Hurt, I'm going to wrap up. Let's
 2 5     skip a couple of things that are in evidence.
	Page   2195
 1              evidence already.
 2                   THE COURT: That's fine.
 3                    MR. GDANSKI: Go ahead, let's show this
 4             to the jury.
 5                    (The video clip was played and taken down
 6              to the best of the reporter's ability as
 7             follows:)
 8                    VOICE: 1 would like you to rise, and
 9             those who will be testifying, as well, with
 10             you, to rise.
 11                    VOICE: Would you raise your right hand?
 12                    Do you swear that the testimony you're
 13              about to give is the truth, the whole truth and
 14              nothing but the truth?
 15                    VOICES: Ido.
 16                    VOICE: Please consider yourself to be
 17              under oath.
 18                    VOICE: Let me begin my questioning on
 19             the matter of whether or not nicotine is 2 0            addictive.
 21                  Let me ask you first, and 1 would like to 2 2            just go down the row, whether each of you 2 3            believes that nicotine is not addictive. 1 2 4            heard virtually all of you touch on it, and 2 5            just "yes" or "no."

Page   2194
 1                 You've seen, after the 1988 report, when
 2      the Surgeon General said nicotine is addictive, did
 3      the tobacco companies come out and counter that?
 4            A.    They did.
 5            Q.   What did they say? What did the industry
 6      say?
 7            A.    Well, they said it was, basically, scare
 8      tactics; and so the '88 report, they wanted to debunk,
 9      basically.
 io            Q.   And we'll have a witness show some of
 11      those videos and show some videos of Dr. Koop at the
 12      time; but you've seen the congressional testimony from
 13      the physicians in 19 - from the CEOs, from the CEOs
 14      of the tobacco companies in 1994; right?
 15            A.    That's correct.
 16                  MR. GDANSKI: Okay. Let's go ahead,
 17            we'll move that into evidence, 01771, please.
 18                  THE COURT: In evidence, over prior
 19            objection.
 2 o                   (Plaintiff's Exhibit 01771 was received
 21            in evidence.)
 2 2                   MR. GDANSKI: And all this stuff -- I'm
 2 3             sorry -
2 4                  THE COURT: That's fine.
 2 5                  MR. GDANSKI: - has been moved in
	Page   2196
 1                     Do you believe nicotine is not addictive?
 2                    VOICE: 1 believe nicotine is not
 3              addictive, yes.
 4                    VOICE: Mr. Johnston?
 5                    VOICE: Congressman, cigarettes and
 6              nicotine clearly do not meet the classic
 7              definitions of addiction. There is no
 8              intoxication.
 9                    VOICE: We'll take that as a "no."
 10                  And, again, time is short. If you could ii            just ~
 12                     1 think each of you believe nicotine is
 13              not addictive. We just would like to have this
 14              for the record.
 15                    VOICE: 1 don't believe that nicotine or
 16              our products are addictive.
 17                    VOICE: 1 believe nicotine is not
 18              addictive.
 19                    VOICE: 1 believe that nicotine is not 2 0            addictive.
 21                    VOICE: 1 believe that nicotine is not
 22              addictive.
 2 3                  VOICE: And 1, too, believe that nicotine
 2 4            is not addictive.

 1       BY MR. GDANSKI:
 2              Q.    The first fellow, that's from Philip
 3       Morris, William Campbell?
 4              A.    Yes.
 5              Q.    And the second one who tried to explain
 6       himself is from Reynolds?
 7              A.    Reynolds, yes.
 8              Q.    And down the line were the other
 9       companies, right?
 10              A.    Yes.
 11              Q.    Okay. And, Dr. Hurt, do the internal
 12       company documents help demonstrate to you why, in
 13       1994, that was the testimony from those folks?
 14              A.    Because admitting it was addictive would
 15       be really difficult for them to then explain that this
 16       is just a matter of choice.
 17              Q.    Let's take a look at PT02184. This is a
 18       memo - it's in evidence ~ from 1980. September 9th,
 19       1980.
 2 o                 And, by the way, did the smoking of 21      cigarettes that Mr. Perrotto had, after 1982, his 2 2      smoking '83, '84, '85, '86, '87, '88, '89, '90, all 2 3      the way up until the time he stopped, did all of that 2 4      substantially contribute to cause his lung cancer? 2 5             A.    It did.
	Page   2199
 1              Q.   And how do you make sense, Dr. Hurt, how
 2       do you reconcile the fact that we looked at all these
 3       documents for 50 years, where inside they're saying,
 4       it's addictive, it's addictive, people smoke for
 5       addiction; no nicotine, we're going to be out of
 6       business overnight -
7                    How do you reconcile that with 1994,
 8       folks standing up telling the truth in front of
 9       Congress and saying it's not addictive?
 10                   MR. COFER: Objection; speculation, lack li             of foundation.
 12                     THE COURT: Sustained.
 13              Q.   What is the historical and -
14                    What is the historical context and
 15       significance of the testimony of the CEOs in 1994?
 16                     MR. COFER: Objection; lack of
 17              foundation, lack of credentials as to
 18               historical significance in that context.
 19                     THE COURT: Sustained.
 20              Q.   As a physician, were you paying attention
 21       to this at the time? 2 2             A.    Yes.
 2 3            Q.   Were you specializing in nicotine 2 4     addiction at the time? 2 5            A.    Yes.

Page   2198
 1               Q.   Okay. In a meaningful and impactful way?
 2               A.    Yes.
 3               Q.   This is from Mr. Knopick to Mr. Kloepfer.
 4       And let's go to Page 2.
 5                     1 feel badly about my own -
6                     And this is a document from the Tobacco
 7       Institute, so an internal tobacco industry document?
 8               A.    These are from the Tobacco Institute,
 9       which was the lobbying arm of the tobacco industry.
 10               Q.    Gotcha. Nobody-
11                     Nick didn't see this in 1980, did he?
 12               A.    No.
 13               Q.   All right. No reason to know that this
 14       existed, right?
 15               A.    Correct.
 16               Q.    Okay. "The lawyers remind us, I'm told,
 17       that the entire matter of addiction is the most potent
 18       weapon a prosecuting attorney can have in a lung
 19       cancer/cigarette case. We can't defend continued
 2 o     smoking as free choice if the person was addicted."
 21                 Do you see that?
 2 2             A.    Ido.
 2 3            Q.   All right. Is that exactly what they
 2 4     did?
 2 5             A.    That's what they did.
	Page   2200
 1              Q.   You were running the Mayo Clinic Center
 2       for Nicotine Dependence?
 3              A.    Correct.
 4              Q.   And what was the medical and historical
 5       significance of what took place?
 6                     MR. COFER: Same objection.
 7                     THE COURT: Rephrase. Just the medical.
 8                     MR. GDANSKI: Sure.
 9              Q.    Dr. Hurt, what is the importance of all
 10       of the industry denials that smoking is addictive, as
 11       compared to the internal knowledge that they knew it
 12       was addictive? Why is it important?
 13              A.    Because it feeds into the rationalization
 14       and denial of the individual smoker that we see in
 15       these patients.
 16              Q.   Is that exactly what happened to Nick
 17       Perrotto?
 18              A.    It did.
 19              Q.   All the opinions and conclusions you've
 2 o     given, do you hold them all to a reasonable degree of
 21     medical probability?
 2 2             A.    Ido.
 2 3                  THE COURT: All right. We'll do about
 2 4            five minutes, and then we'll --
2 5                   MR. COFER: Yes.

 7      BY MR. COFER:
 8             Q.    Dr. Hurt, good morning. I'm Walt Cofer.
 9      1 have just a couple of quick questions for you before io     we break for lunch.
 11                  Did you say it's your opinion to a
 12      reasonable degree of medical certainty that the pain
 13      medications caused constipation? Right?
 14             A.    Idid.
 15             Q.   And that the constipation caused him to
 16      have a sigmoid volvulus?
 17             A.    That was the most likely cause.
 18             Q.   And that's your opinion to a reasonable
 19      degree of medical certainty, right? 2 0             A.    Correct.
 21                   MR. COFER: That's all 1 have until after
 22             lunch.
 23                   THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, 1 2 4             actually am going to take an early lunch
 2 5            recess. And 1 apologize and ~

 2              Santo Perrotto. 1 don't know if we'll get to
 3              it this afternoon or --
4                     MR. GDANSKI: It doesn't seem like it.
 5                    THE COURT: Okay. Well, then, we'll get
 6              to it when we get to it.
 7                    All right. We'll be in lunch recess,
 8              everyone.

 3             office in a few minutes.
 4                   So let me give everybody a lunch recess,

	Q    You happen to fall under the category of

11

	11
	someone that becomes addicted very quickly, right?

12
	THE COURT: Sure. Dr. Hurt, please.
	12
	A    That's correct.

13
	Welcome back, Doctor. Back on the witness
	13
	Q    There are people who smoke and don't

14
	stand. Okay. We'll bring the jurors in.
	14
	become addicted, right, Doctor?

15
	(The jury entered the courtroom at 1:17 p.m.)
	15
	A    That's true.

16
	THE COURT: Good afternoon, everyone.
	16
	Q    Even though they're regular smokers, yes?

17
	Welcome back. I hope everyone had a pleasant

	MR. COFER: Thank you, Your Honor, may it

1               Q    Then, in 1975, your wife asked you to go

2         to the smokers cessation clinic, that was in

3         Methodist Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, right,

4         Doctor?

5              A    It was a smokers clinic, not a smokers

6         cessation.

7               Q    Smokers clinic. Okay. Thank you.

8                    And that was the clinic that you

9         ultimately became the director of, correct?

10              A    That's correct.

11               Q    It was an eight-week program where you met

12         every Monday night for two hours, right, Doctor?

13              A    Yes.

14               Q    And the purpose of you participating in

15         the program was to quit smoking, right?

16              A    That's correct.

17               Q    And the program required commitment on

18         your part, didn't it?

19              A    It did.

2 0             Q    It required you to follow through and keep

21        going to that program, right?

2 2             A    It did.

2 3             Q    And the people who ran the program, for

2 4        the most part, weren't doctors, they were

2 5        counselors; right?

Page   2214

1               A    They weren't even counselors at that time.

2          The two that led it were ex-smokers themselves.

3               Q    Okay. And so four weeks into that

4          program, you quit smoking, right?

5               A    I did.

6               Q    And just so it's clear, you were a highly

7          addicted smoker, correct?

8               A    Yes.

9               Q    You spent two hours in the smoker

10          cessation clinic for four weeks and then you were

11          able to quit, right, Doctor?

12               A    Two hours a week for four weeks, yes.

13               Q    And then you never smoked again, right?

14               A    I did not.

15               Q    And that's been almost 39 years since you

16          had your last cigarette; correct, Doctor?

17               A   I haven't done the math lately, but that

18          sounds about right.

19               Q    It was '75, so it's 2014, so almost 40, so 2 0         I came with it. It's been a real long time, right?

21               A    Been a real long time.

22               Q    Now, during direct examination you talked 2 3         about the concept of rationalization and denial,

2 4         right?

2 5             A    Yes.

1              Q    And you gave the jury an example from your

2         own life, didn't you?

3              A    I did.

4              Q    You said that while you were in medical

5         school your cadaver had COPD, right?

6              A    She did.

7              Q    So let's talk about that. During the

8         surgery rotation, you would actually have a dead

9         body or cadaver to cut on or to practice on to work

10         from, right?

11              A    It was gross anatomy.

12              Q    Gross anatomy.

13                   And your cadaver had COPD, presumably from

14         smoking; correct?

15              A    Presumably, yes.

16              Q    And you were a smoker?

17              A    Yes.

18              Q    But you told the jury that you

19         rationalized, it's not going to happen to me, right? 2 0             A    That's what I said.

21              Q    And it didn't happen to you; did it,

22         Doctor?

23              A    No.

2 4             Q    That's because you quit smoking, right?

25             A    That's correct.

1              Q    You listened to your wife; you did what

2         you needed to do to kick the habit and break your

3         addiction, right?

4              A   Well, we don't talk about the habit, so I

5         did stop smoking, but I stopped smoking dozens of

6         times before that for a very short period of time,

7         but this is the longest period of time that began on

8         November 22nd.

9              Q    What happened was your doctor ï¿½ I'm

10         sorry, your wife, in 1975, asked you to go to this

11         clinic and asked you to stop smoking, right?

12              A   Well, we went together.

13              Q    Okay.

14              A    So she had signed us both up to go to the

15         smokers clinic, along with Mollie and her friend.

16              Q    Okay. And you made the commitment, 1975,

17         November 22nd, you quit smoking, you never smoked

18         again; right?

19              A    That's correct.

2 0             Q    In 1975 was the very same year that Debra

21        Perrotto met Nicholas Perrotto and began encouraging

2 2        him to quit smoking, right, Doctor?

23            A    I think they met in 1975, yes.

2 4             Q    Do you remember her testifying that she

2 5        was encouraging him to quit smoking basically from

1
	the day they met?
	1
	Q    So that's $5,600 a day, right, Doctor?

2
	A    Basically.
	2
	A    That's correct.

3
	Q    From the day they met?
	3
	Q    You also charge for your travel time;

4
	A    I think that's right, yes.
	4
	correct?

5
	Q    Okay. Dr. Hurt, you don't believe that
	5
	A    Yes.

6
	adults in this country should be allowed to choose
	6
	Q    So when you flew from Rochester to West

7
	to smoke, do you?
	7
	Palm, you charged $5,600 for that day; right?

8
	A    Say again?
	8
	A    I think ï¿½ I haven't put that on the

9
	Q    You don't believe that adults in this
	9
	billing yet, it would be, I think, six hours rather

10
	country should be allowed to choose whether to
	10
	than eight hours for that particular trip. I

11
	smoke, right?
	11
	haven't done that yet.

12
	A   Adults can choose to smoke, sure.
	12
	Q    You will charge $5,600 for each day that

13
	Q    But you don't believe they should be; you
	13
	you're here; right?

14
	believe that cigarettes in this country should be
	14
	A    Correct.

15
	banned, right?
	15
	Q    You will charge your time to fly home;

16
	A   No, I have never said that. I have said
	16
	correct?

17
	basically that if the question were, "Would the
	17
	A    Yes.

18
	world be better off without cigarettes?" The answer
	18
	Q    When did you arrive?

19
	would be, "Yes."
	19
	A    It's been a long time ago.

20
	Q    You never said that you would like
	20
	Q    In West Palm, when did you show up?

21
	cigarettes in this country banned?
	21
	A    I think it was Wednesday.

22
	A    I don't recall saying that. I may have.
	22
	Q    So you have been here Wednesday through   ji

23
	I have said a lot of things.
	23
	today?

24
	Q    Okay. In the past four years you have
	24
	A    Today, yes.

25
	testified in eight other tobacco cases besides this
	25

	Saturday, Sunday, Monday ï¿½ six days?

2
	A    Well, it depends on what you mean by
	2
	A    Uh-huh.

3
	testified. I have done depositions, but I've
	3
	Q    Yes?

4
	only ï¿½ this is the fourth one ï¿½ actually, the
	4
	A    Yes.

5
	fifth one I have testified in as far as trial.
	5
	Q    And that's six days times $5,600?

6
	Q    You told the jury on Friday that this was
	6
	A    Yes.

7
	the third case in Florida you testified at trial,
	7
	Q    And then another $5,600 when you fly

8
	right?
	8
	home ï¿½ well, if it's today, great; if not, if it's

9
	A   Well, I can go back and recount them. So
	9
	not until tomorrow, it's another $5,600, right?

10
	it was Schlenther, Bowden.
	10
	A    It has to be today.

11
	Q    Bishop?
	11
	Q    Okay. We're going to do our best to get

12
	A   Westmoreland.

	you out today, okay?

13
	Q    Lambert and Perrotto.
	13
	How many days was that, six days, at

14
	This is your fifth trial that you have
	14
	$5,600 a day? How much is that?

15
	testified in.
	15
	A    I don't know.

16
	A    I think that's right, yeah.
	16
	JUROR: 38,000.

17
	Q    You charge $700 an hour for your time,
	17
	THE WITNESS: I'm sorry? I didn't hear   !

18
	right?
	18
	you.

19
	A    That's correct.
	19
	JUROR: 38,000.

20
	Q    When you give a deposition or testify at
	20
	THE COURT: 38,000.

	spent eight hours testifying; right?
	24
	Q    So 38,000, plus you had, in preparation

2

	2
	A    Yes.

3
	Q    That's another 9,800, so that's almost
	3
	Q    What else have you done?

4
	48,000.

	A    Consulting for a couple pharmaceutical

	5,600, right?
	6
	Q    On behalf of pharmaceutical companies?

7
	A    That's correct.
	7
	A   No. Consulting with them, helping them

8
	Q    And so that takes us up to about 54,000.
	8
	with products to help people stop smoking.

9
	And then you spent a couple more hours
	9
	Q    Okay. Thank you.

10
	preparing in between your deposition and your
	10
	In addition to testifying in lawsuits, you

11
	testimony on Thursday, right?
	11
	have given at least one lecture to plaintiffs

12
	A   Well, that was probably all on Wednesday
	12
	lawyers about how to bring lawsuits against tobacco \

13
	that I did that, when I was here on Thursday waiting
	13
	companies; right?

14
	for the trial to start.
	14
	A    It was a lecture on being the first

18
	$55,000 just for your work and testimony in this
	18
	Win a Just Tobacco Verdict," right, Doctor?

19
	case, right?
	19
	A   That was the title, yes.

20
	A    That's if you've done the math correctly,
	20
	Q    And your speech was: "How to Be the First   \

21
	that would be right.
	21
	Witness," correct?

7
	tobacco cases than any other of your professional

	Q    And one of your goals was to not give up

9
	MR. GDANSKI: I object, that's also

1               Q    September 4th, 1996, right?

2              A    Ifyousayso.

3              Q    Okay. You were not involved in this case

4         until October of 2013; is that right?

5              A    I think that's right, yes.

6              Q    So that would have been 17 years after

7         Mr. Perrotto passed, right, sir?

8              A    If you have done the math correctly, yes.

9              Q    Okay. Don't necessarily trust my math. I

10         will do my best, but...

11                    You never talked to Mrs. Perrotto, the

12         plaintiff in this case, have you?

13              A   No.

14               Q    You haven't talked with any members of her

15         family, have you?

16              A   No.

17               Q    You haven't talked with Mr. Perrotto's

18         healthcare providers, right?

19              A    Correct.

2 0             Q    So basically the information that you have

21        for your opinions comes from the materials that you

2 2        were sent to review, correct?

2 3             A    That's correct.

2 4             Q    The medical records you talked about with

2 5        the jury, right?

Page   2226

1              A    Yes.

2               Q    And some of the depositions that were

3         taken in this case, right?

4              A    That's correct.

5              Q    Okay. Much of the information you have

6         about Mr. Perrotto comes from what he told

7         Mrs. Perrotto, right, sir?

8              A    Yes.

9              Q    And Mr. and Mrs. Perrotto did not meet

10         until 1975, right?

11              A    That's correct.

12               Q    So, obviously, she doesn't have any

13         firsthand information about Mr. Perrotto before she

14         met him, right?

15              A    That's correct.

16              Q    Okay. Dr. Hurt, it's true, isn't it, that

17         not everyone who smokes is addicted?

18              A    Say again?

19              Q    It's true, isn't it, that not everyone who 2 0         smokes is addicted?

21             A    That's correct.

2 2             Q    In fact, not all smokers who smoke lots of

2 3        cigarettes over a long period of time are addicted,

2 4        right, Doctor?

2 5             A    Most of them are.

1               Q    Right, but it's true that not all smokers

2         who smoke lots of cigarettes over a long period of

3         time are addicted, right?

4              A   There's a small percentage, but there's a

5         percentage like that, yes.

6              Q    Okay. And being addicted to nicotine in

7         cigarettes doesn't mean that smokers can't quit,

8         right?

9              A    That's correct.

10               Q    People who are addicted can quit, people

11         who aren't addicted can quit, right?

12               A    Yes.

13               Q    Even heavily addicted smokers can and do

14          quit smoking every day, right?

15              A    They do.

16               Q    By 1965, one year after the Surgeon

17          General's first report on smoking and health, over

18          17 million smokers had already quit smoking in the

19         United States, right, Dr. Hurt?

2 0             A    Well, there were more than that.

21             Q    By 1965?

2 2             A    Yes.

2 3             Q    Tell me.

2 4             A    Because the ones that died stopped

2 5         smoking, too.

Page   2228

1              Q    Okay. Well, let's do this, let's look at

2         the 1989 Surgeon General's report. This is PMU8569.

3                   "The number of former smokers who

4         increased substantially between 1965 and 1985.

5         Thus, in 1965, there were about 17.6 million adult

6         former smokers, (12.4 million men and 5.2 million

7         women). By 1985, this number had risen to

8         40.9 million, (25.2 million and 15.7 million

9         women)."

10                   Are you familiar with that data from the

11         1989 Surgeon General's report?

12              A   Yes, but it doesn't include the people who

13         died. There were more smokers who stopped smoking

14         than are reflected there.

15              Q    Well, because that number are the number

16         of people who were alive that put their cigarettes

17         down and quit smoking, right, as reported by the

18         Surgeon General, correct, Doctor?

19              A   And using the definition we talked about 2 0        earlier.

21              Q    And that's the one that the Surgeon

22         General's reporting in the 1989 Surgeon General, 2 3        correct, sir?

2 4            A    That's in that report, yes.

25            Q    All right. By 1979, about four years

Page   2229

1         after Mr. and Mrs. Perrotto met, over 30 million

2         Americans had quit smoking, right?

3              A    Well, again, that's an underestimate

4         because it doesn't count those who died.

5              Q    This is PMU8567. This is a 1979 Surgeon

6         General's report. Here is what the Surgeon General

7         reported in 1979:

8                    "Today, more than 30 million Americans are

9         ex-smokers. This does not include the number of

10         people who, after considering the risks, chose never

11         to take up the habit; they must also number in the

12         millions. The number of cigarettes consumed per

13         person in the United States has declined from 4,345

14         in 1963" ï¿½ and that was a year before the landmark

15          Surgeon General's report, right, sir?

16              A    Yes.

17               Q    - "to 3,965 in 1978. In fact, per

18         capita, cigarette consumption this past year is at

19         its lowest level in 20 years.

2 0                  "These facts, without a doubt, are in

21        large part due to efforts by public health agencies

2 2        and voluntary groups to inform the public about the

2 3        risks of smoking."

2 4                  That's what the Surgeon General reported

2 5        in 1979, correct, Doctor?

Page   2230

1              A    The thing they don't report is the per

2         capita consumption went down mainly because the

3         population increased in size.

4               Q    Is this what the Surgeon General reported

5         in the 1979 Surgeon General's report?

6              A   Yes, but there are other parts of the

7         report, too.

8               Q    And you will have an opportunity on

9         redirect, counsel will have an opportunity to bring

10         those to your attention, all right?

11              A    Okay.

12               Q    The 1994 Surgeon General's report noted,

13          "Since 1964, about 44 million Americans have quit

14          smoking." Right, Doctor?

15              A    Ifyousayso.

16              Q    Okay. You want me to ï¿½ you trust me or

17         do you want me to show it to you?

18              A    You're reading it, so it's got to be in

19         there somewhere.

2 0             Q    All right. You told the jury last week

21        that 50 million Americans have quit smoking, right?

2 2             A    I said 50 million living Americans have

2 3        stopped smoking, yes.

2 4             Q    Actually, there are close to 60 million

2 5        alive ex-smokers in the United States, right?

Electronically signed by Gina Rodriguez (201-182-126-9514)

Page   2231

1              A    That could be. I haven't looked at the

2         numbers of late.

3              Q    Okay. Did you testify in the Bishop trial

4         that there are upwards of 60 million ex-smokers,

5         alive ex-smokers in the United States?

6              A    I-

7              Q    That would have been a couple of weeks

8         ago.

9              A   I don't recall that exact statement, no.

10              Q    No reason, though, to dispute that, if I

11         said that you testified on October 28th, 2014, in

12         the Bishop trial here in Florida that there are

13         upwards of 60 million alive ex-smokers in the United

14         States?

15              A    If that's what it says, that's what it

16         says.

17              Q    Between one and two million Americans quit

18         smoking every year, right, Doctor?

19              A    I think that's about right, yes.

2 0             Q    Each and every day, each and every day in

21         this country, about 3,000 Americans quit smoking,

22         right, Dr. Hurt?

23              A    I think that's correct.

2 4             Q    Today there are more former smokers than

2 5        current smokers, right?

Page   2232

1              A    That's correct.

2               Q    And in your opinion, the vast majority of

3         those people were addicted, right?

4              A    The majority were, yes.

5               Q    Smokers have the ability to decide whether

6         to quit, don't they?

7              A    They have the ability to quit, they do.

8               Q    And you told the jury I think last Friday

9         that motivation is very important to quitting

10          smoking, right?

11               A    I think I said motivation is what we work

12          on a lot with smokers, and motivation interviewing

13         is a technique that we use.

14               Q    It is important, isn't it, it is important

15         for people to decide that they really want to quit,

16         make up their minds they really want to quit, and to

17         make an effort or efforts to quit, right, Doctor?

18               A    Motivation leads to trying to stop

19         smoking, and trying to stop smoking does ultimately 2 0         lead to most people quitting, yes.

21             Q    And I think you may have said last week

2 2        that stopping smoking is a process, it doesn't

2 3        happen all at once, with most people it takes

2 4         several tries before a person is able to stop

2 5         smoking; and that's true, isn't it, Doctor?

	BY MR. COFER:

11
	Smoking, 1977 to 1978."
	11
	Q    I will just ask you again.

12
	MR. COFER: Gina, am I talking too fast?
	12
	You had smokers at your clinic tell you

13
	Will you tell me if I am? Thank you.
	13
	that they get pleasure from smoking, right?

14
	BY MR. COFER:
	14
	A    I don't recall that, but if you have

15
	Q    "Cigarette smoking represents a category
	15
	something that says that, maybe it's there.

16
	of health problems that can be called personal
	16
	Q    Okay. You've had smokers, you claim, tell

17

	17
	you that smoking relaxes them, right?

18
	A    That's what it says.
	18
	A    Same answer. That's not something we

19
	Q    In 1986, the Surgeon General was
	19
	commonly tell people. It's something that may come i

20
	C. Everett Koop, right?
	20
	up from time to time.

21
	A    I think that's right, yes.
	21
	Q    Let's look at your deposition from the

22
	Q    He was the general that had the
	22
	Bishop case, and maybe that will refresh your

	have the wrong volume.

12
	Q    Have you heard that before?

	MR. GDANSKI: I'm there, but I do think

17

	some of the patients that you treat at the clinic

	pleasure from smoking, yes or no?

	report that smoking gives them pleasure?"

4
	A    I think probably I should see that, too,

	just to see what the context is.

6
	MR. COFER: May I approach, Your Honor?

	MR. GDANSKI: Ask that question. See what

9
	MR. GDANSKI: Yes.

	of this manual, this brochure, correct, Doctor?

10
	THE COURT: I'll sustain.

	THE COURT: All right, ladies and

1         didn't intend to smoke forever. Like others, you

2         thought you could quit whenever you wanted to. You

3         may have found that quitting smoking is harder than

4         you thought it would be.

5                   "There are many reasons why people smoke.

6         Smoking makes people feel satisfied and calm.

7         Smoking may also make them feel more focused and

8         alert. For some people, the more cigarettes they

9         smoke, the more they need to smoke to feel good.

10         Soon, many smokers don't feel quite right without

11         smoking. This is the addiction cycle of cigarette

12         smoking.

13                   "There are many reasons why people want to

14         quit smoking, too. They may be concerned about

15         their health. They may want to save money, have

16         more energy, or be a positive role model. Their

17         family and friends may be voicing concerns.

18                   "Remember that it takes time, patience and

19         practice to quit smoking. It may take more than one 2 0        try to quit for good. Don't give up. You can learn 21        to feel good again without depending on tobacco."

2 2                 And that's true, isn't it, Doctor?

2 3             A    Yes.

2 4             Q    Later in the brochure, it says: "Making

2 5        decisions. Only you can decide when to quit

Page   2242

1         smoking."

2                   That's true, too, right?

3              A    That's one of the statements that's in

4         there.

5                   This is not a brochure, though. This is a

6         manual we use for the counselors to use directly

7         with patients. So there's counseling goes alongside

8         of all of that so that the counselor is involved

9         with the patient. We don't just hand these out to

10         patients and say, "Read this and come back and see

11         us next year."

12              Q    No, I understand, and I certainly didn't

13         mean to convey that impression. What I was pointing

14         out is that this is a manual that you helped write

15         that has statements that you believe, right?

16              A    Correct.

17              Q    Okay. Now, you told the jury that the

18         half-life of nicotine 120 minutes, right?

19              A    That's right.

2 0             Q    So after a smoker quits smoking, the

21        nicotine is gone from his blood stream in about ten

2 2        hours, right?

2 3             A    About ten hours. Five half-lives.

2 4             Q    And the nicotine is completely gone from

2 5        his or her body in about 72 hours, or three days,

Page   2243

1         right?

2              A   Well, the half-life is really what drives

3         it all, so within ten hours the blood levels are

4         very low.

5              Q    And the nicotine is completely gone from

6         the body in about 72 hours, correct?

7              A   It would be vacating from all the

8         different parts of the body, yes.

9              Q    In the manual, you describe what

10         withdrawal symptoms are like; right?

11              A    We try very hard to put that into a graph,

12         and it's not easy.

13              Q    You said: "Almost every-"ï¿½

14                   "My body's response to no more nicotine.

15         Almost everyone experiences some symptoms of

16         withdrawal when they stop smoking. For most smokers

17         withdrawal symptoms last for several weeks, becoming

18         less intense and less frequent over time."

19                   Is that right?

2 0            A    That's what we say. I don't know if those

21        are the exact words. If you're reading from the

2 2        manual, so yeah.

2 3             Q    I am. I'm just trying to save time.

2 4                 You also talk about urges, and you write:

2 5                 "Urges, also called cravings, occur even

Page   2244

1         when smoking. They can be frequent and intense soon

2         after stopping, but they are brief, lasting one to

3         two minutes. As time goes on, urges occur less

4         often, are less intense, and don't last as long;

5         however, you could experience urges even months

6         after you stop smoking."

7                   That's true, too, right?

8              A    That's true.

9              Q    Okay. For the record, that is PMU40273.

10                   Thank you, Dr. Hurt.

11                   You talked with the jury about dopamine

12         last week. So when a person smokes, the nicotine

13         acts in the part of the brain that has to do with

14         pleasure, right?

15              A    It does.

16              Q    And it causes the brain to release

17         dopamine, right, Doctor?

18              A    That's correct.

19              Q    There are lots of things that cause 2 0        release of dopamine, aren't there?

21              A    Yes.

22              Q    In fact, anything that produces a

2 3        pleasurable response will release dopamine, right? 2 4            A   I think I said that the other day, yes.

25            Q    Things like alcohol triggers release of

1         dopamine, right?

2              A    Chocolate. Exercise. Caffeine.

3              Q    Exercise, caffeine, eating chocolate,

4         having sex, having a good meal, watching an exciting

5         sporting event, right?

6              A    Correct.

7              Q    Any time you experience something that you

8         enjoy or that may be exciting, it's going to cause

9         release of dopamine, right?

10              A    That's what we think, yes.

11              Q    You talked with the jury on direct

12         examination about how nicotine actually causes an

13         increase or upregulation of nicotinic receptors in

14         the brain, right, Doctor?

15              A    Yes.

16              Q    But after a smoker quits smoking, the

17         number of receptors actually goes down to normal in

18         a few months, right?

19              A    In a few months, yes.

2 0             Q    Okay. But to be fair, you talked about

21         other brain changes, too, right?

22                   On direct, you talked about other brain

2 3        changes. You said there are indelible memories that

2 4        even after the nicotinic receptors downregulate to

2 5        the number that we started with, you still have the

Page   2246

1         memories of smoking, right?

2               A    That's correct.

3               Q    Okay. We all experience life through

4         brain changes, right?

5               A   We all experience ï¿½

6               Q    That's how we experience life, is through

7          changes to the brain. That's memories, our brain

8          changes, right?

9              A    Well, not quite this rapid.

10               Q    Every day you and I are experiencing brain

11          changes right now, right? I'm not sure it's going

12          to be good or bad.

13               A    I'm not sure about that.

14               Q    But we're experiencing it, right?

15               A   No, the brain has some ability to change,

16         but these changes are in direct relationship to the

17          high doses of nicotine, and that's really ï¿½ I think

18          the slide says it's unique in biology, and it is

19         unique in biology. This is something that doesn't 2 0         happen unless you have both nicotinic receptors 21         stimulated by the spike of nicotine.

2 2             Q    Right. But the nicotinic receptors

2 3         downregulate to the number you start with, but you

2 4         have the memory of smoking, right?

2 5             A    And it's an indelible memory, and as I

Electronically signed by Gina Rodriguez (201-182-126-9514)

Page   2247

1         explained to the jury, even for cocaine rats, it's

2         different than it is for nicotine rats. So it's

3         really different. It's unique in biology. Most

4         drugs cause downregulation of the receptors, and

5         this drug causes upregulation of the receptors.

6              Q    Caffeine causes upregulation, too?

7              A    To a minor degree.

8              Q    But same thing, you have some drugs

9         downregulate. Caffeine, nicotine, upregulate,

10         right?

11              A   Most of the dmgs downregulate.

12              Q    But in any event, those 60 million

13         American ï¿½ or living ex-smokers, the vast majority

14         of those had brain changes, too, right?

15              A    We don't know that for sure. We don't

16         know how many of them had those extensive brain

17         changes like we showed from the slide that I showed

18         from the autopsy studies. No one's done a

19         systematic study of a large number of smokers 2 0        because you can't do a large study like that. 21             Q    Well, that's a good point. I'm glad you

2 2        mentioned that because I missed that on direct. So

2 3        not everybody has these brain changes? 2 4             A    Well, we don't know. What we know about

2 5        this is that when you look at the saturation of the

Page   2248

1         brain receptors in the smokers that have been

2         studied, the nicotine saturates those receptors very

3         quickly. So we have a growing amount of evidence,

4         but we don't have large studies of brain biopsies

5         because smokers don't volunteer for brain biopsies.

6              Q    And obviously, there was no brain biopsy

7         looking for nicotinic receptors or indelible memory

8         changes on Mr. Perrotto.

9              A    That's correct.

10              Q    You talked to the jury about The Heaviness

11         of Smoking Index, and you told the jury you used

12         that to determine that Nicholas Perrotto was

13         addicted, right, Doctor?

14              A    That's correct.

15              Q    And the Heaviness of Smoking Index asks

16         two questions: How soon after you wake up do you

17         smoke your first cigarette, and how many cigarettes

18         a day do you smoke, right?

19              A    Those are the two questions.

2 0             Q    Now, it's true, isn't it, Doctor, that the

21        Heaviness of Smoking Index was designed to diagnose

2 2        the level of dependence, not whether someone is

2 3        dependent, right?

2 4            A    That's the idea, yes.

1
	zero on the Heaviness of Smoking Index, they're
	1
	A   Described by some people that way, but not

2
	still dependent under the test, right?
	2
	by those of us in the addictions field.

3
	A    I don't think smoking ï¿½ I don't think
	3
	Q    Well, we'll talk about that. But you told

4
	zero would be there, but I would have to go back and
	4
	the jury you don't like the word "habit" because you  \

5
	look where the actual origin of that is.
	5
	believe it trivializes how hard it is to quit,

6
	Q   Yeah. Actually, if you look at Fagerstrom
	6
	right?

7
	too, even if you score a zero, you're diagnosed as
	7
	A    I don't know if I said those words, but it

8
	having low level of dependence, right?
	8
	does, it makes it into something that it really

9
	A    Right.
	9
	isn't.

10
	Q    So the truth is, under The Heaviness of
	10
	Q    Is that a fair description of your

11
	Smoking Index or Fagerstrom, no matter what you
	11
	feelings about that?

12
	answer, you're dependent, the only issue is how
	12
	A    True.

13
	dependent, right?
	13
	Q    Okay. You do agree, don't you, that the

14
	A    That's the idea.
	14
	practice of using the words "addiction" and "habit"

15
	Q   And those are the tests you used to
	15
	or "habituation" interchangeably has sometimes led   i

16
	determine whether Mr. Perrotto was addicted, right?
	16
	to some confusion, right?

17
	A    Correct.
	17
	A    They have.

18
	Q    So the Heaviness of Smoking Index and
	18
	Q    Okay. In fact, World Health Organization

19
	Fagerstrom assume that everyone who regularly smokes
	19
	talked about that, didn't it?

20
	is addicted or dependent, right?
	20
	A   It did.

21
	A    It is assuming that the majority are, that
	21
	Q    It said that they tried to come up with

22
	those are the data, yes.
	22
	the definition of addiction and distinguish it from

23
	Q    But you know that everyone is not, right?
	23
	a habit, but it was confusing, and so the World

24
	A    That's correct.
	24
	Health Organization said, "You know, it's better to

25
	Q    There are other measures of nicotine
	25
	actually use the word 'dependence,'" right?


	Page   2250
	
	Page   2252     jj

1
	dependence, right?
	1
	A   I don't recall that exact wording, but

2
	A   Yes.
	2
	that's probably true.

3
	Q    I think you told us in your deposition,
	3
	Q    Okay. Does that sound right to you?

4
	the one most talked about is the DSM or the
	4
	A    That sounds right.

5
	Diagnostic Manual of the American Psychiatric
	5
	Q    Okay.

6
	Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual,
	6
	A   We use the term "dependence" more often

7
	right?
	7
	than "addiction."

8
	A    That's correct.
	8
	Q    All right. In 1964, the jury's heard this

9
	Q    In fact, you and your colleagues at the
	9
	in opening statement, they may have heard it with

10
	Mayo Clinic have used DSM-IV and DSM-5 in your work
	10
	Mr. Gdanski, the Surgeon General actually describes   ij

11
	with dependent smokers, right?
	11
	smoking as an habituation. Right?

12
	A    That's correct. That's right.
	12
	A    Correct.

13
	Q    I think you told the jurors yesterday that
	13
	Q    And the reason why is, there are lots of

14
	the '88 Surgeon General's report, I think it's in
	14
	reasons, but the principal reason why is that in

15
	the 2010 report, too, there is no consensus on the
	15
	1964, the definition of addiction that the Surgeon

16
	definition of addiction, right?
	16
	General used at the time required that the substance

17
	A    On nicotine addiction. That was in the
	17
	be intoxicating, correct, Doctor?

18
	'88 report, that's what I mentioned, yes.
	18
	A    That's correct.

19
	Q    Yeah, I think it's actually in the 2010
	19
	Q    And smoking is not intoxicating?

20
	report, too.
	20
	A   Not in the sense that other drugs are, no.

21
	A   It could be.
	21
	Q    Okay. But what the Surgeon General did in

22
	Q    Okay. It is true, isn't it, that the
	22
	'64, is he wanted to make it clear that he wasn't

23
	words "addiction" and "habit" have been used
	23
	suggesting it was easy to quit ï¿½ and this is a page

24
	interchangeably over the years to describe it could
	24
	from the Surgeon General's report, I had it in my

25
	be hard for some smokers to quit smoking, right?
	25
	opening. Just easier to show you this.

1                    But here's what the Surgeon General said

2          at page 351 in 1964. And here he talks about the

3          difference between drug addiction and drug

4          habituation. Tobacco habit characterized as

5         habituation. And it says:

6                    "Thus, correctly designating the chronic

7          use of tobacco as habituation rather than addiction

8          carries with it no implication that the habit may be

9         broken easily."

10                    Correct, Doctor?

11               A    That's what it says.

12               Q    Bottom line is, we've known for a long

13          time, that some people have a really hard time

14          quitting smoking; right?

15               A    Correct.

16               Q    And that is true whether you call it

17          addiction, habituation or dependence; right?

18               A    Regardless what you call it, it's very

19          difficult for most smokers to stop smoking. 2 0              Q    And you said it better than I did.

21               A    That's what I was trying to say.

22               Q    So then what happened in 1988 is the

2 3         Surgeon General adopted a different definition of

2 4         addiction and said, "Intoxication is no longer

2 5         required," right?

Page   2254

1              A    It happened a long time before that as far

2         as the definitions changed, not because of the '88

3         Surgeon General's report.

4              Q    Well, what happened was there was lots of

5         discussion in the scientific community and

6         elsewhere, and it was in 1988 that the Surgeon

7         General devoted a report to nicotine addiction, and

8         so they looked at the science, and they devoted a

9         report to that issue, and they determined that

10         applying the definition used in 1988, that smoking

11         is addictive and intoxication is no longer required,

12         right?

13              A    I don't know that it said intoxication no

14         longer required, but it did talk about the ï¿½ there

15         not being a consensus on the definition.

16              Q    Okay. Would you give me PT02231, please?

17                    So the very first document that you and

18         Mr. Gdanski showed the jury Friday was a document

19         written in 1959. It was a Philip Morris document 2 0        from J.W. Geiger to Dr. R.N. DuPuis, dated

21        August 26, 1959.

2 2                 Do you remember that?

23              A    I do.

2 4             Q    Okay. Let me show the jury the first

2 5        paragraph. You guys didn't show the jury this. Let

Electronically signed by Gina Rodriguez (201-182-126-9514)

Page   2255

1         me ask you some questions about this.

2                    "Early this year I was assigned the task

3         of reading and studying the reports now on hand

4         which pertain to the subject of psychological

5         research. These were the Chicago Tribune Reports

6         (Burleigh Gardner)."

7                    What is the Chicago Tribune?

8               A    The newspaper.

9               Q    It's the newspaper ï¿½ it's the newspaper

10          in Chicago, right?

11               A    Yes.

12               Q    And, "The series of Roper reports, and

13          such other reports as came to my attention," right?

14                    Did I read that correctly?

15               A    You read it correctly.

16               Q    So at least here it is referring to some

17          published literature and some newspaper reports,

18          right?

19               A    That's what it says.

2 0             Q    Okay. You weren't trying to leave the

21        jury with the impression that Mr. Geiger had some

2 2         sort of secret information, were you?

23             A    I can't remember what we cited in this

2 4         particular one.

25             Q    Let me show you.

Page   2256

1              A   I don't know about how these Roper reports

2         were basically surveys usually, so...

3              Q    Let me show you.

4                   So here's what you showed the jury: "Why

5         Do People Smoke." And then you showed the jury on

6         page 2, number 3, the answer was, among other

7         things, "addiction," right?

8              A    Among other things, yes.

9              Q    Okay. And then Mr. Gdanski said:

10                   "Did Philip Morris ever share this

11         document with the Surgeon General? Did Philip

12         Morris give this confidential document to the

13         Surgeon General before the 1964 report?"

14                   A few objections.

15                   And ultimately you said you had no reason

16         to think they did, or something like that. Right?

17              A    "Not to my knowledge," I think is what I

18         said.

19              Q    And then you testified:

2 0                 "If only Philip Morris would have done

21        that, it would have made a big difference to the

2 2        Surgeon General, and the Surgeon General would have

2 3        been able to conclude that smoking was addictive."

2 4                 Do you remember that?

25            A    Well, it's not only this document, there

13    (Pages   2253   to   2256)

99857482-17b1-47f3-ba4c-6df670e2ce1e

Page   2257

1         are other documents as well that preceded the '64

2         report.

3              Q    There were lots of documents that preceded

4         the '64 report, and let's look at a couple of them.

5                   Let's start with PMU57443. This is a

6         report from the Surgeon General of the United States

7         in 1950. Studies in vocational disease. The health

8         of garment workers. Prepared by direction of the

9         Surgeon General.

10                   Do you see that?

11              A    I do.

12              Q    And this is 1915. So this would have been

13         44 years before that Geiger memo you showed the

14         jury, right?

15              A    Correct.

16              Q    Let's see what the Surgeon General had to

17         say in 1915.

18                   "It is seen that cigarette smoking is by

19         far the most popular form of tobacco addiction among 2 0        male garment workers. The kind of cigarettes most

21         preferred by these workers were Turkish cigarettes."

22                    So this is the Surgeon General's report in

2 3         1915, 44 years before this Philip Morris document

2 4        that refers to cigarette smoking as an addiction,

2 5        right, Doctor?

Page   2258

1              A    That's what it says.

2               Q    That was 24 years before Nick Perrotto was

3         born, correct?

4              A    Correct.

5              Q    Have you seen this document before?

6              A    I have.

7               Q    You didn't show the jury this document on

8         direct, did you?

9                    MR. GDANSKI: That's argumentative.

10                    THE COURT: Sustained.

11         BY MR. COFER:

12               Q    But you were familiar with this document

13         last week?

14              A    I have seen it before, yes.

15               Q    You also showed the jury actually a

16         pull-out of a document from one of your slides that

17         had quotes from a document written by Bill Dunn at

18         Philip Morris in 1980 that says: "Our attorneys,

19         however, will likely continue to insist upon

2 0        clandestine effort in order to keep nicotine the

21        drug in low profile."

2 2                  Do you remember that?

23              A    I do.

2 4             Q    Okay. You told the jury that Lancet is

2 5        the Premier British Medical Journal in the UK,

Electronically signed by Gina Rodriguez (201-182-126-9514)

Page   2259

1         right?

2              A    Premier general medicine journal from the

3         UK, yes.

4              Q    You said it's equivalent, it's comparable

5         to the New England Journal of Medicine, which is the

6         leading journal in the United States, correct?

7              A    Correct.

8              Q    Let me show you an article published in

9         the British Medical Journal and the British Medical

10         Journal, I think you said, was akin to the Journal

11         ofthe -

12              A    High ï¿½ high impact journal.

13              Q    ï¿½ American Medical Association, right?

14              A   I don't know if I said that, but it's a

15         high-impact ï¿½

16              Q    Very good journal?

17              A    Good journal, yeah.

18              Q    So this is from ï¿½ and this is, for the

19         record, Your Honor, PMU1892 from Lennox Johnston, 2 0        "Effects of Tobacco Smoking on Health, British

21        Medical Journal, 1945.

2 2                 "Effects of Tobacco Smoking on Health."

23        This is 1945. How old is Nick Perrotto? Five or

2 4        six?

25            A    Five or six, yeah.

Page   2260

1               Q    "The fundamental facts are that tobacco is

2         a drug, and smoking a drug addiction (more

3         precisely, a means of administering a drug of

4         addiction). But as a luxury; and smoking is

5         mentioned freely, but as a habit. Drugs of

6         addiction are not, however, luxuries, and habit

7         merely supplements the main urge to smoke, viz., an

8         inner craving. Drug addiction, and therefore

9         tobacco smoking, is a disease."

10                    That's July 21, 1945, right, Doctor?

11               A    Was this Lennox Johnston?

12               Q    Yes.

13              A    So go back up to where you were.

14               Q    I will do it in a second.

15                    But are you familiar with this document?

16         You obviously are because you want me to show

17          something else.

18               A    Yes.

19               Q    So this is July 21, 1945, right? 2 0             A    Correct.

21             Q    Okay. What else do you want me to show?

2 2             A    Just go back up a little bit.

2 3                  I just saw ï¿½ there's someplace in this

2 4         article he talks about the encroachment upon

2 5         smoke-free places. I don't know if this article or

	another one.
	1
	tobacco documents until 1998, right?

2
	Q    I've got two more I'm going to show you so
	2
	A   I started looking at them about 1996.

3
	maybe ï¿½ let's look for it. If it's not this one,
	3
	Q    Okay. '96,'98, whatever.

4
	it is another one.
	4
	We know ï¿½ there's no reason to think

5
	The bottom line is: This is 1945, Nick is
	5
	Lennox Johnston had these documents back in 1942 jj

6
	five or six, where you've got in the British Medical
	6
	when he wrote: "On the assumption that smoking

7
	Journal, a high-impact journal, being published by
	7
	tobacco is essentially a means of administering

8
	scientists. "The fundamental facts are that tobacco
	8
	nicotine, just as smoking opium is a means of

9
	is a drug and smoking a drug addiction." Right?
	9
	administering morphine," right?

10
	A   Yeah. And it goes on to say: "Drug
	10
	A   No, he would not have had access to that.

11
	addiction, and, therefore, tobacco smoking, is a
	11
	This is apparently they were doing ï¿½ giving

12
	disease."
	12
	intravenous ï¿½ or interdermal nicotine doses to

13
	Q    Right.
	13
	those people.

14
	A    And he uses the word: "An intoxication
	14
	Q    So you're very familiar with this work,

15
	like the majority of diseases although the specific
	15
	right?

16
	toxins are not bacterial."
	16
	A    I have found it, yes.

17
	Q    Okay.
	17
	Q    Okay. Let me show you another one. This

18
	A    That is a little bit confusing, but he
	18
	is 1947.

19
	used the word "intoxication." I'm not sure exactly
	19
	And for the record, Your Honor, this is

20
	why.
	20
	PMU1893. This was also published in the British

21
	Q    All right. But you agree that that's a
	21
	Medical Journal in 1947.

22
	mouthful there.
	22
	"Tobacco smoking is not a habit but a drug

23
	It is a drug addiction, right?
	23
	addiction, a disease."

24
	A    Correct, yes, a disease.
	24
	Did I read that correctly?

25
	Q    A disease.
	25
	A    You read it correctly.


	Page   2262
	
	Page   22 64     \

1
	So let me show you ï¿½ actually, it says:
	1
	Q    You couldn't say it any more clearly,

2
	"The fundamental facts are that tobacco is
	2
	could you?

3
	a drug, smoking is a dmg addiction, (more
	3
	A   No, but he goes on to say: The essence of

4
	precisely, a means of administering a dmg of
	4
	a habit is that it is acquired by repetition, and

5
	addiction)." Right?
	5
	references tobacco smoking as a habit, carrying the

6
	A    If you said so.
	6
	implication that the repetitive action of tobacco

7
	Q    Let's show you one from three years before
	7
	smoke is the essence of tobacco smoking, not

8
	that.
	8
	intoxication.

9
	And this one is actually Lancet. So that
	9
	So he had it ï¿½ he is way ahead of his

10
	last one is British Medical Journal, this is Lancet.
	10
	time. He had it right.

11
	This is 1942.
	11
	Q    Yeah, 1947.

12
	Tobacco smoking and nicotine. On the
	12
	A    And this is Lennox Johnston?

13
	assumption that "smoking tobacco is essentially a
	13
	Q    Yeah, this is 1947. So this is 50 years

14
	means of administering nicotine, just as smoking
	14
	before you got the Minnesota documents. 50 years.

15
	opium is a means of administering morphine."
	15
	"Tobacco smoking is not a habit, but a

16
	Did I read that correctly?
	16
	drug addiction, a disease." Right?

17
	A    You did.
	17
	A   And he goes on to talk about

18
	Q    So the concept that a cigarette was a
	18
	nonintoxication. So he had that part right, too.

19
	nicotine delivery device, wasn't some secret held
	19
	Q    Okay. Now, I want to go back and show for

20
	only in the archives of the tobacco company, was it?
	20
	a minute PMU1892 that talks about on the assumption

21
	A    Well, to the extent that we know now more
	21
	that "smoking tobacco is essentially a means of

22
	about this product because the tobacco companies, as
	22
	administering nicotine, just as smoking opium is a

23
	stated by one of the documents, had more information
	23
	means of administering morphine." And that's 1945,

24
	about nicotine than anybody else on the planet.
	24
	right?

25
	Q    What we do know is that you didn't get the
	25
	A   I don't see the date, but if you say it's

	No one has ever become a cigarette smoker by smoking  jj

2
	Q    So let me show you another document that
	2
	cigarettes without nicotine."

3
	you and Mr. Gdanski used on direct examination on
	3
	Then you going guys showed the next page.

4
	Friday. And this is a Philip Morris document,
	4
	"Think of cigarette pack as a storage

5
	PT03677. Motives and Incentives in Cigarette
	5
	container for a day's supply of nicotine. It is

6
	Smoking, by Bill Dunn, Philip Morris Research
	6
	unobtmsively portable. Its contents are instantly

7
	Center, Richmond, Virginia.
	7
	accessible. Think of the cigarette as a dispenser

8
	Do you remember that document?
	8
	for a dose unit of nicotine."

9
	A   I do.
	9
	And then when Mr. Gdanski was finished, I

10
	Q    Okay. He showed the jury a few quotes.
	10
	said, "Would you read one more sentence for mle of

11
	A   What was the date of this?
	11
	completeness." And so I had him read the very last

12
	Q    This is, I believe, 1972. Let me look and
	12
	sentence of the speech that said ï¿½ two sentences, I

13
	see.
	13
	guess: "This is the end of my presentation. If you

14
	Well, I know it's around ï¿½ I know it's
	14
	have been intrigued by any of these ideas, I

15
	'72, just bear with me and we'll ï¿½
	15
	recommend the recently published volume entitled

16
	A    That's okay.
	16
	'Smoking Behavior: Motives and Incentives,' a

17
	Q    So what this is, so the jury knows, this
	17
	compendium of papers presented at the St. Martin

18
	is actually a speech that Bill Dunn gave at a
	18
	conference, published by V.H. Winston & Sons of

19
	CORESTA conference, right?
	19
	Washington, D.C.," right, Doctor?

20
	A    That's correct.
	20
	A    That's what it says.

21
	Q    And we'll talk about that in a second.
	21
	Q    Okay. So let's talk about that.

22
	But what happened was that Bill Dunn, who
	22
	So we had the conference and Bill Dunn,

23
	was with Philip Morris, hosted a conference in St.
	23
	who is an employee of Philip Morris, hosted it. And

24
	Martin in the Caribbean, right?
	24
	he invited a bunch of people from schools like

25
	A    That's correct.
	25
	Harvard, Michigan, University of London, UCLA, and


	Page   2266
	
	Page   22 68     \

1
	Q    Mr. Gdanski said Cayman Islands, but it
	1
	Florida to attend, right?

2
	wasn't Cayman Islands, it was St. Martin, right?
	2
	A    I don't know the list.

3
	MR. GDANSKI: Somewhere sunny.
	3
	Q    Okay. Well, I can show it to you if you

4
	MR. COFER: Sir?
	4
	want.

5
	MR. GDANSKI: Somewhere sunny.
	5
	A    That's okay.

6
	MR. COFER: Somewhere sunny, there you go.
	6
	Q    And then he gave a speech where he

7
	BY MR. COFER:
	7
	summarized that conference. And this was on

8
	Q    And he invited researchers from around the
	8
	October 25th, 1972, in an organization called

9
	world to come to this conference, and the topic was,
	9
	CORESTA in Williamsburg, Virginia, right?

10
	"Why People Smoke," right?
	10
	A    If you say so. I don't have it in front

11
	A    I think that's right, yes.
	11
	of me, so I don't know.

12
	Q    Okay. And then after they had this
	12
	Q    It is an open conference where members of

13
	conference and he gave a speech in Virginia at a
	13
	the public are invited to attend, right?

14
	CORESTA conference, we'll talk about that, and so
	14
	A    Correct.

15
	this was part of his public speech.
	15
	Q    In fact, we have a list of the

16
	I think it's 1972. "The majority of the
	16
	registrants, and this is PMU32702. I will show you

17
	conferees" ï¿½ it is referring to the people that
	17
	if you'd like, but I will go through it.

18
	attended the conference in St. Martin on why people
	18
	The attendees included people like

19
	smoke. He summarized what their views were.
	19
	Gio Gori from the National Cancer Institute, Gerald

20
	And he said: "The majority of the
	20
	Merrifield and Harold Pillsbury from the United

21
	conferees would go even further and accept the
	21
	States Federal Trade Commission, Richard Amacher

22
	proposition that nicotine is the active constituent
	22
	from the National Clearing House for Smoking and

23
	of cigarette smoke. Without nicotine, the argument
	23
	Health ï¿½ and that's the Surgeon General's office,

24
	goes, there would be no smoking. Some strong
	24
	right?

25
	evidence can be marshaled to support this argument.
	25
	A    I think it was at that time.

3         Health Foundation, Fred Clarke and H.W. Lundy from

4         the University of Florida, among others. Right?

5              A    If you say so, yes.

6              Q    Any reason to dispute that?

7              A    No.

8              Q   And so they gave that speech, and then

9         afterwards he was actually interviewed by the local

10         newspaper.

11                   And for the record, this is PMU1189. It

12         is the Daily Press, Newport News, Hampton, Virginia,

13         Sunday, October 29, 1972.

14                   Explain for the jury the date in the

15         newspaper.

16                   Here's a picture of Bill Dunn. And it

17         says: "Why Do People Smoke?"

18                   And, again, that was the title of his

19         speech, and that was the purpose of the conference. 2 0        And then he gave an interview where he said ï¿½ and 21        this was on the Sunday edition on the public paper. 2 2                 "One smokes primarily for the

2 3        physiological response to inhaled smoke; that is,

2 4        for the physical reaction of the body to inhale

2 5        nicotine. The other two propositions from the group

Page   2270

1         stated that the main ingredient in cigarette

2         smoke" ï¿½ this is 1972 ï¿½ "which produces the

3         physical response is nicotine, and that the, quote,

4         sought-after responses result in psychological

5         efficiency."

6                   Did I read that correctly?

7              A    I think so, yes.

8              Q    Had you seen the newspaper articles

9         before? Did you understand kind of the

10         circumstances, the context of that document you

11         showed the jury?

12              A    I understood the context. I don't think

13         I've ever seen the newspaper article.

14              Q    But you did understand the context, right?

15              A    Right.

16              Q    Okay. So just backing up, big picture, so

17         we have a conference with people from the public are

18         invited; we have a speech where people are invited,

19         including people from the Surgeon General's office; 2 0        we have a newspaper article that was published

21        Sunday, in a local newspaper; and then we have a

2 2        book that results from the conference called

2 3        "Smoking Behavior: Motives and Incentives." 2 4                 For the record, this is PMU0057, right?

1              Q    And it's tme that this book has been

2         cited in the Surgeon General's reports a number of

3         times, hasn't it?

4              A    I think so.

5              Q    Twelve times in four different Surgeon

6         General's reports. Any reason to disagree with

7         that?

14         look.

15              Q    But you know the Surgeon General has

16         reviewed it and cited it in his reports on smoking

17         and health, right?

18                   MR. GDANSKI: You said that. Asked and

2 0                 THE COURT: Sustained.

21         BY MR. COFER:

22              Q    So here's some ï¿½ it's just easier to 2 3        display, so I made a copy of it.

2 4                  So here's some of the articles.

25        "Neuropsychopharmacology of Nicotine and Tobacco

Page   2272

1         Smoking."

2                   "Further Observation on Nicotine as the

3         Reinforcing Agent in Smoking."

4                   Tell the jury who Murray E. Jarvik is, the

5         person who wrote that chapter.

6              A    As I recall, Murray was from California.

7         He was an early pioneer in nicotine dependence.

8              Q    He's the guy that invented the nicotine

9         patch, right?

10              A   Depends on who you believe.

11              Q    Well, a lot of people credit Jarvik for

12         inventing the nicotine patch.

13              A   Well, Jed Rose takes credit for that, too,

14         so he ï¿½

15              Q    A lot of people take credit for a lot of

16         stuff. But bottom line is we had some big-deal

17         nicotine researchers and scientists there, right?

18              A   Well, he was a pioneer in tobacco

19         dependence, yes.

2 0             Q    "Nicotine-Related Neurochemical Changes:

21         Some Implications for Motivational Mechanisms and

22         Differences." Right?

23              A    That's what it says.

2 4             Q    These are chapters from the book.

2 5                 Then it has a list contributors to the

1         book. You've got the Veterans Administration,

2         Harvard, Michigan, Philip Morris, University of

3         London, Columbia, Pennsylvania, University of

4         California, LA, others, right?

5              A    It's a long list, yes.

6              Q    And that's basically the context of the

7         document you showed the jury about people smoking

8         for nicotine and think of the cigarette as a storage

9         container for a day's supply of nicotine, right?

10              A    What was the question?

11              Q    That is basically the context of that

12         document you showed the jury on Friday that said:

13         "Think of the cigarette pack as a dispenser of

14         nicotine." The context is there was a meeting with

15         public health officials and people from major

16         universities, there was a speech given to the

17         public, there was an interview in the newspaper,

18         there was a book published by the ï¿½ that was

19         reported by the Surgeon Generals at least four 2 0        times, four different reports ï¿½12 times, four

21         different reports, right?

22              A    That's what you said.

2 3             Q    And that's what we just demonstrated

2 4        through the exhibits, correct? 2 5             A    That's what you did, yes.

Page   2274

1              Q    You showed the jury a couple different

2         definitions of addiction, right?

3              A    We did.

4              Q    You showed the one from NIDA and you

5         showed the one used at the Mayo Clinic, correct?

6              A    Correct.

7              Q    Let's show the one you used at the Mayo

8         Clinic.

9                   It's the bottom one, sir. It says:

10         "Nicotine dependence, also called tobacco

11         dependence, is an addiction to tobacco products

12         caused by the drug nicotine. Nicotine dependence

13         means you can't stop using the substance even though

14         it's causing you harm."

15                   Did I read that correctly?

16              A    You did.

17              Q    Nick Perrotto did not meet that

18         definition, did he?

19              A    He continued to smoke after the diagnosis 2 0        of his lung cancer, as far as we know.

21             Q    And then he stopped in October of 1992,

2 2        and he never had a single cigarette the last four

2 3        years of his life, right?

2 4             A    He stopped smoking because he was too sick

2 5        to smoke.

2         was he?

3              A    Correct, but he was too sick to smoke,

4         that's what he said.

5              Q    He wasn't too sick to a take a 17-hour

6         road trip to New Jersey and back from New Jersey to

7         Florida, right?

8                   MR. GDANSKI: It's argumentative.

9                   THE COURT: Overruled.

10                   THE WITNESS: I don't know that. I don't

11              recall that, but it could be.

12         BY MR. COFER:

13              Q    I will represent to you that just before

14         he went in the hospital in '96, he and his wife had

15         returned from a trip to New Jersey, and it's a

16          17-and-a-half-hour drive from New Jersey to West

17         Palm. Any reason to dispute that?

18              A   No, I don't know the circumstances of that

19         trip, no.

2 0             Q    And I will represent to you that his

21         treating physicians testified he was not too sick to

22         smoke.

23                   MR. GDANSKI: I object. It's counsel 2 4              testifying.

25                 THE COURT: Sustained.

Page   2276

1         BY MR. COFER:

2              Q    Bottom line is, he quit, and after October

3         of '92, he never smoked again; right?

4              A    That's correct, as far as we know.

5              Q    So when I was little, my dad used to tell

6         me and my two brothers ï¿½

7                   MR. GDANSKI: I object.

8                   MR. COFER: May I finish the question?

9                   THE COURT: Go ahead and finish the

10              question.

11                   MR. COFER: Let me finish the question

12              because it may not be objectionable.

13         BY MR. COFER:

14              Q    So when I was little, my dad used to tell

15         me and my two brothers, he said: "Sons, there are

16         three kinds of people in this world: Those who

17         learn easy, those who learn hard, and those who

18         never learn."

19                   My question is: Did your dad ever tell 2 0        you anything like that?

21                   MR. GDANSKI: I have no idea what is going

22              on right now, so I object.

23                   THE COURT: I'll sustain your objection.

2 4                 MR. COFER: I thought it was a pretty good

2 5             question.

	2
	very heavy smoker within the first six to eight

4
	BY MR. COFER:
	4
	So those trajectories are the average for

5
	Q    You told the jury earlier that
	5
	children when they start smoking, but there are real

6
	Mr. Perrotto began smoking in 1952, he was about 13
	6
	outliers of this that happen all the time. So we

7
	years old, right?
	7
	don't know when he became a regular smoker. But if jj

8
	A    That's what's reported, yes.
	8
	you use those data, then it would have been within

9
	Q    You don't know when he became a regular
	9
	that time frame you mentioned. But we don't know

10
	smoker, do you?
	10
	for sure.

11
	A    Well, if he followed the trend of most
	11
	Q    And that's my point. And we don't know

12
	people in that age group, he would have become a
	12
	for the same reasons when he became addicted, right? jj

13
	regular smoker within a few years. Those are the
	13
	A   We don't know that he didn't become a

14
	data that we know happens.
	14
	regular heavy smoker at age 14. We just don't know,   jj

15
	Q    And what was the second word you just
	15
	Q    I'm sorry, what did you say, we do know he

16
	used? If.
	16
	became a ï¿½

17
	A    If. So people ï¿½
	17
	A   We do not know that he was not a regular

18
	Q    So we don't know when he became a regular
	18
	smoker, two packs a day, at age 14. We just don't

19
	smoker, right?
	19
	know.

20
	A    We don't. But using the usual trajectory
	20
	Q    We don't know one way or the other, right?

21
	for children when they start smoking, it's usually
	21
	A    Correct.

22
	within the first three years they become regular
	22
	Q    It would be very unlikely for him to be a

23
	smokers.
	23
	regular two-pack-a-day smoker at age 14, right?

24
	Q    Now, this morning Mr. Gdanski showed the

25
	jury a medical record that said he smoked two to

	1
	they are teenagers but they quit in their 20s,

2
	record was written in 1992 or 1993. Do you remember
	2
	right?

3
	that?
	3
	A    There are some that do, but when you ask a

4
	A   I remember one of those, yes.
	4
	teen smoker, most of them you ask the question, "Do   jj

5
	Q    And then Mr. Gdanski went back with the
	5
	you intend to be a smoker when you're 21?" They all  jj

6
	math and tried to suggest and get you to agree that
	6
	say, "No, I'm just going to do this for a while, and

7
	Mr. Perrotto was smoking two to three packs a day
	7
	I will hang out with my friends." And they never

8
	from age 13. Do you remember that?
	8
	realize they're going to become addicted and then

9
	A    I don't remember that question, no.
	9
	they continue to smoke into their adulthood.

10
	Q    You don't? But we know that's just

	MR. COFER: I move to strike that as

11
	absolutely not tme, right?
	11
	nonresponsive.

15
	BY MR. COFER:
	15
	listen to my question and see if you can answer the

16
	Q    Is there any basis in the record to
	16

17
	suggest that Mr. Perrotto was smoking two to three
	17
	There are people who start smoking when

18
	packs of cigarettes a day when he was 13 years old?
	18
	they are teenagers, but quit in their 20s, true?

19
	A    We have no information.
	19
	A    True.

20
	Q    Right. And you think that if he followed
	20
	Q    There are people who start smoking in

21
	the usual trajectory, he was probably a regular
	21
	their teenage years and quit in their 30s, right?

22
	smoker by the time he was 17 or 18, right?
	22

	times before life circumstances, health

	tried to quit smoking?"

	5
	"ANSWER: I believe it was the early'80s

6
	A    I think I probably said that, yes.
	6
	he tried to quit."

7
	Q    Dr. Hurt, there is no evidence that
	7
	Does that refresh your recollection,

8
	Mr. Perrotto ever tried to quit smoking prior to
	8
	Doctor, that Mrs. Perrotto testified that her

9
	1980 when he was about 40 years old, right?
	9
	husband never made an attempt to quit smoking before   ji

10
	A    I think Mrs. Perrotto indicated he tried
	10
	the 1980s?

11
	to stop smoking numerous times. I don't know the
	11
	A   Early 1980s is what she said. I recall

12
	time frame of that.
	12
	her mentioning some dates or some years, but I don't

13
	Q    So it's your recollection that
	13
	know, if that's what it says in her deposition, it

14
	Mrs. Perrotto said he tried to stop smoking prior to
	14
	must be what it is.

15
	1980?
	15
	Q    Because what happened was that when

16
	A    I don't recall the date. It was numerous.
	16
	Mrs. Perrotto decided that she wanted to get

17
	She said numerous times on numerous occasions
	17
	pregnant, she asked her husband to quit smoking,

18
	throughout her three volumes of her deposition.
	18
	right?

19
	Q    Okay. Well, we will walk through that and

	child being born, and she wanted him to stop smoking

21
	A    That will be good.
	21
	because of Michael being born, yes.

22
	Q    You don't know when Mr. Perrotto first
	22
	Q    She asked him to quit smoking before she

23
	tried to quit smoking, right?
	23
	even got pregnant.

24
	A    I don't think we know that for sure. At
	24

	where we have a specific date was in the 1981-1982 ji

4

	4
	time frame when Mrs. Perrotto was pregnant, right?   \

	A   I think that's correct.

6
	time when Mr. Perrotto cut down on his smoking or
	6
	Q    And Mr. Perrotto didn't even quit for 24

7
	quit for a day, right?
	7
	hours, did he?

8

	A    I think that's correct.

9
	Q    Can I represent to you that Mrs. Perrotto
	9
	Q   And let's talk about that.

10
	testified on page 41, line 9 through 12, this
	10
	You agree with the Surgeon General that a

11
	question and this answer.
	11
	serious quit attempt is one that lasts 24 ï¿½ over 24

12
	"When is the first time that Mr. Perrotto
	12
	hours, right?

13
	tried to quit smoking?"
	13
	A    That's the definition we commonly use for

14
	Answer: "I believe it was the early '80s
	14
	a serious quit attempt, just so we have a

15
	he tried to quit."
	15
	definition. Just like the definition we use for an

16
	Does that refresh your recollection that
	16
	ever-smoker smoking a hundred cigarettes a day.

17
	Mrs. Perrotto testified he never tried to quit
	17
	So those definitions were basically kind

	smoking prior to the early 1980s?

	of set arbitrarily, so this is just like the hundred

20
	was?

	21
	24 hours as a serious quit attempt, you, Dr. Hurt

23
	got a copy if you need it.

	explained a little bit, just like the definition of
	3
	Mr. Perrotto, right?

4
	classifying a person as a smoker who smoked 101
	4
	A    I recall that, yes.

5
	cigarettes in their lifetime.

	6
	worked for me, give it a try," right?

7
	"Well, the fact that he didn't quit for 24 hours
	7
	A    I think that's right.

8
	doesn't mean he wasn't addicted, right?"
	8
	Q    He gave Mr. Perrotto the hypnotist's card,

9
	And you said: "Right." Fair?
	9
	correct?

10
	A    I think that's correct.
	10
	A    Could have. I don't recall that.

11
	Q    But according to the Surgeon General in
	11
	Q    But Mr. Perrotto never told Mr. DeRosa

12
	the definition that you used, it does mean that he
	12
	that he actually went to see the hypnotist, did he?

13
	did not make a serious quit attempt, right?
	13
	A    I don't think there was any record of him

14

	14
	going to a hypnotist, no.

	16
	actually going to the hypnotist, right?

17
	through 18 ï¿½
	17
	A    I think that's correct.

18
	MR. GDANSKI: Judge, I think he answered
	18
	Q    So what we have is, we have the brother

19
	the question.
	19
	going to a hypnotist in 1979 and quitting smoking,

20
	THE COURT: Let him hold the deposition.
	20
	right?

21
	BY MR. COFER:
	21
	A    Well, I don't know how long that lasted,

22
	Q    Do you recall the Surgeon General having
	22
	but if he said he stopped smoking after that, then

23
	said that a serious quit attempt is one that lasts
	23
	that's what it says.

24
	over 24 hours?
	24
	Q    And then you have Mrs. Perrotto saying

25
	A   I don't recall which document that came
	25
	that she had a conversation with Mr. Perrotto when   jj

	Page   2288     \

1
	from or where it came from originally, no.

	she was pregnant about him going to a hypnotist,

2
	THE COURT: Mr. Gdanski, do you have an
	2
	right?

3
	objection?
	3
	A    I recall that, yes.

4
	MR. COFER: I'm just asking him the exact
	4
	Q    But no one knows whether he actually went  \

5
	question now.
	5
	to the hypnotist, correct?

6
	THE COURT: I'm sorry. Go ahead.
	6
	A    Not to my knowledge.

7
	BY MR. COFER:
	7
	Q    All we know is that he said he did, right?

8
	Q    And do you consider a 24-hour quit
	8
	A    He said it was recommended for him to do

9
	attempt ï¿½ I'm sorry.
	9
	that.

10
	Do you consider a serious quit attempt as
	10
	Q    To the extent that you're relying on what

11
	one that lasts over 24 hours?
	11
	Mr. Perrotto told Mrs. Perrotto, your opinions in

12
	MR. GDANSKI: I think this has all been
	12
	this case, are you assuming that Mr. Perrotto was

13
	asked and answered.
	13
	candid with her?

14
	MR. COFER: It has been asked a couple of
	14
	A   Up to a certain degree. I think there's

15
	times.
	15
	always a lot of denial and rationalization we talked   \

16
	THE COURT: Sustained.
	16
	about and minimizing some of the things. But she

17
	THE WITNESS: So-
	17
	did some observations that were pretty clear as far

18
	THE COURT: I sustained the objection.
	18
	as his time to first cigarette and those sorts of

19
	MR. COFER: You know what, good enough.
	19
	things.

20
	That's fine. Thank you.
	20
	Q    Based on your review of all the

21
	BY MR. COFER:
	21
	information, do you believe that Mr. Perrotto was

22
	Q    Let's talk about the hypnotist. Richard
	22
	candid with Mrs. Perrotto, or do you think he only

23
	DeRosa, Mrs. Perrotto's brother, quit smoking in
	23
	told her what he wanted her to hear ï¿½ what he

24
	1979 by going to a hypnotist, right?
	24
	thought she wanted to hear?

25
	A    I recall that, yes.
	25
	MR. GDANSKI: I object, overbroad.

10              A    I did.

11               Q    Well, you know that Mr. Perrotto was

12         married to Barbara Heppinstill, right?

2               Q    Correct.

3               A    I don't recall that, but if it's in the

4          deposition, that's what she said.

5               Q    It's at Volume 3, April 4, 2014, page 460,

6          lines 2 through 9. Do you want me to show you?

7               A   No. If you say it's there, it must be

8          there.

9               Q    The tmth is that when Mr. Perrotto first

11          you," he was already married and didn't tell her

10         they are based, right?

11                   MR. GDANSKI: I object. It's

14         BY MR. COFER:

15              Q    Mrs. Perrotto testified she did not see

16         Mr. Perrotto take any concrete action to quit

17         smoking between the time that Michael was born in

18         1982 and 1992 when he quit for good; right?

19              A   All I recall is that she talked about him

2 0        making numerous attempts to quit, and I don't know

21        the context as far as the years are concerned that

2 2        you're mentioning.

23            Q    Let me read this to you, and I will show

2 4        you if you want it. This is, for the record, from

2 5        Plaintiff Debra Perrotto's deposition, Volume 3,

2                   Question: "Well, that's what I'm trying

3         to get at. My recollection of your testimony is you

4         have no indication of any concrete action your

5         husband took to quit smoking after Michael was born

6         until he ultimately quit for good in September or

7         the fall of 1992, correct?"

8                   "ANSWER: Yeah, yes."

9                   Does that refresh your recollection that

1         want to make sure we're being fair.

2                   Was she asked whether he made any efforts

3         to quit smoking entirely during the time period when

4         Michael ï¿½ before he went to preschool, and did he

5         say: "Well, he always told me he tried."

6                   And was she asked: "Did you witness him

7         making any concrete actions to quit smoking while

8         Michael was an infant or toddler and before he went

9         to preschool?"

10                   And you know that she said, "No," right?

11              A    I think that's right.

12              Q    And then she was asked: "Well, how old

13         was Michael when he went to preschool?"

14                   And she said: "About four, three and a

15         half, four. Okay, that's'85 or'86."

16                   And then he said: "Okay. Well, then,

17         between ï¿½ if he didn't try to quit between the time

18         he was bom and preschool, did he try to quit

19         between preschool and when he got his lung cancer?" 2 0                 And she said: "No."

21                   Do you remember that?

22              A    I remember something like that.

2 3             Q    And then he said: "Okay. So then the

2 4        deal is, you have no evidence, you have no

2 5        recollection of him ever trying to quit between the

Page   2298

1         time your son was bom in '82 and when he was

2         diagnosed with cancer in '92?"

3                    And she said: "That's right." Right?

4              A    It must be.

5              Q    And I'll tell you why I went through all

6         that is because on Monday, Mr. Gdanski pointed out

7         some testimony from Mr. Perrotto's son, John, from

8         their first marriage. You remember that, those

9         questions and that testimony?

10              A    Yes.

11               Q    So what happened was, you had

12         Mrs. Perrotto say he never tried to quit from '82 to

13         '92, he never took any concrete action, right?

14              A    That's what she said.

15               Q    And then we had John Perrotto, the son

16         from his first marriage, say that when his dad

17         turned 50, in 1989, that his dad decided to get

18         healthy, so he joined the gym, quit smoking, started

19         working out, and to his knowledge, never went back 2 0        to smoking, right?

21             A    He said that.

2 2             Q    And he said that he talked to his dad, and

2 3        his dad told him he didn't have any trouble quitting

2 4        and that he felt good and that everything was great;

2 5        right?

1              A   I don't recall those exact words from

2         Mr. Perrotto's son's deposition.

3               Q    I've got pages of testimony. Was that

4         kind of the general tenor of his testimony, that his

5         dad quit, that he didn't have any trouble quitting,

6         and that to his knowledge, he never went back to

7          smoking?

8              A    It's the middle part I don't remember.

9         That he didn't have any trouble quitting, I don't

10         know that that's in there. He did say that he tried

11         to stop smoking at age 50 because he wanted to lose

12         weight, get in shape.

13                    He was asked the question: "Why do you

14         think that was?"

15                    He said, well, he thought it was kind of a

16         sentinel moment or a time to regather things

17         together. That's what I remember. I don't remember

18         the easiness of stopping it.

19               Q    Do you remember him saying he felt good, 2 0        he was exercising, he lost weight, he was feeling

21         good, never said he had any trouble quitting, do you

2 2        remember that?

2 3             A    I don't remember that sentence, no.

2 4             Q    But in any event, that testimony is

2 5        completely inconsistent with Debra Perrotto's

Page   2300

1         testimony that her husband took no concrete action

2         to quit smoking between '82 and '92, right?

3              A   It would seem to be that way, yes.

4               Q    I mean, they can't both be right.

5              A    Correct.

6              Q    Either he didn't do anything to quit

7         between '82 and '92, or he laid his cigarettes down

8         in '89 and '90 and he lost weight and got into

9         shape, right?

10               A    That would be correct.

11               Q    Who's right?

12               A    I don't know.

13               Q    Mrs. Perrotto testified that Mr. Perrotto

14          chewed nicotine gum, right?

15              A    She mentioned gum. I don't know that it's

16         ever been clarified whether it was nicotine gum or

17         not.

18               Q    Yeah, I was wondering that, too, because

19         you had a demonstrative that you put up that had all 2 0        the things ï¿½ those are my checkmarks, sorry.

21                  You said chewing gum. You didn't say

2 2        nicotine gum, right?

2 3             A    I think it was ï¿½ she talked about

2 4        nicotine gum, but I'm not sure we have evidence of

2 5        that. But we don't not have evidence of it either,

2
	Q    Well, actually, let's go through it,
	2
	A    Correct.

3
	because we kind of do not have evidence of it.
	3
	Q    And there's no evidence any doctor ever

4
	She said she believes he tried ï¿½ well,

	wrote Mr. Perrotto a prescription for nicotine gum,

	actually, she said it was nicotine replacement gum.

	is there?

6
	At page 510, lines 10 through 12.
	6
	A    I have not seen any medical records to

7
	"Do you remember it was a nicotine
	7
	that effect.

8
	replacement gum or just a regular gum?"
	8
	Q    And she testified that until he was

9
	"No, it was nicotine replacement gum."
	9
	diagnosed with lung cancer, no doctor ever advised

10
	A    Okay.
	10
	him to quit smoking, right?

11
	Q    And she said: "When did that happen?"
	11
	A    I don't recall that, but if you're reading

12
	"A little after I was pregnant."
	12
	it, you must be reading her deposition.

13
	Michael was born in '82, right?
	13
	Q    I will tell you, Volume 1, January 28,

14
	A    Correct.
	14
	2014.

15
	Q    And then Mrs. Perrotto said she thinks he
	15
	"Was there any doctor who advised him to

16
	got the gum over the counter at Walgreens. Do you
	16
	stop smoking before he was diagnosed with lung

17
	remember that?
	17
	cancer, do you know?"

18
	A    I remember something like that.
	18
	It's page 242, line 9.

19
	Q    Do you agree that the Center for Disease
	19
	"No, he was relatively a very healthy

20
	Control is a reliable authority for when
	20
	person.

	21
	"Okay. So to the best of your knowledge,

22
	became available?
	22
	that was the first time any doctor had said stop

23
	A    Yes.
	23
	smoking, is when he was diagnosed with lung cancer, jj

24
	Q    Let me show you, this is PMU17386, "US

	1
	Do you remember that?

2
	So you can see what that is.
	2
	A   I remember there was a long hiatus

3
	And here is a chart that tells when all
	3
	between ï¿½ my interpretation of that was he didn't

4
	this stuff came on the market.
	4
	see doctors very often.

5
	So first she said that she thought he
	5
	Q    Well, she testified that no doctor ever

6
	chewed gum about the time ï¿½ nicotine gum about the
	6
	told him to quit smoking, and he never asked a

7
	time she was pregnant, and she thought he got it at
	7
	doctor for help in quitting, right?

8
	Walgreens over the counter, right?
	8
	A   I think that's what she said.

9
	A    I think that's what she said, right.
	9
	Q    So if that's true, then there obviously

10
	Q    But we know that couldn't have happened
	10
	was no one to get a prescription from.

11
	because it wasn't available over the counter until
	11
	A    That's correct.

12
	April of 1996, right?
	12
	Q    So it's not clear whether he ever actually

13
	A    That's correct.
	13
	tried the nicotine gum, correct?

14
	Q    And he had stopped smoking four years
	14
	A    That's not clear to me, no.

15
	before then, correct?
	15
	Q    There was also some testimony about

16
	A    Yeah.
	16
	whether he used a nicotine patch, correct?

17
	Q    Well, actually stopped October of'92,
	17
	A    Correct.

18
	correct?
	18
	Q    But it wasn't available over the counter

19
	A   April of '96 was a few months before he
	19
	until August of 1996, and, of course, he had stopped

20
	died.
	20
	smoking four years before then, right?

21
	Q    And the gum wasn't even available by ï¿½ it
	21
	A    Correct. It was available by prescription

22
	was available by prescription in February of'84,
	22
	late December of 1991 and early 1992.

23
	correct?
	23
	Q    And, of course, Mrs. Perrotto said, again,

24
	A    That's correct.
	24
	that Mr. Perrotto made no concrete effort to quit

25
	Q    But he would have had to have a
	25
	smoking between '82 and when he was diagnosed, in   \

1         here, right, '92?

2              A    Yes.

3              Q    And also there is no record of any

4         physician ever prescribing a nicotine patch for

5         Mr. Perrotto, right?

6              A    Yeah, I think we heard earlier today that

7         we have a lot ofï¿½ a lot of records we had not seen

8         because they don't exist anymore.

9              Q    And Mrs. Perrotto said that he tried to

10         use the patch when she was pregnant, and there were

11         multiple times he tried to use it while she was

12         pregnant back here. And the patch hadn't been

13         invented yet, right?

14              A    It had been invented, but it had not been

15         really studied, no.

16              Q    Well, it wasn't even on the market until

17         '92.

18              A    Correct. December'91, January'92.

19              Q    But she was pregnant back in'82. 2 0             A    Correct.

21             Q    Okay. So there's no evidence that he

2 2        actually used the patch either, right?

23             A    No.

2 4             Q    Mr. Perrotto quit smoking in 1992 after he

2 5        was diagnosed with lung cancer, right?

Page   2306

1              A    That's correct.

2              Q    His doctors told him he had to stop,

3         correct?

4              A   Well, as I recall, it was after he had

5         received his chemotherapy and radiation therapy that

6         he was too sick to smoke.

7              Q    Did Mrs. Perrotto testify that he stopped

8         cold turkey at that point because, quote, "He said

9         he was going to die"?

10              A   Well, at one point she said he said to

11         her, "I'm a dead man," and there are other places

12         where she said he stopped smoking because he was too

13         sick to smoke.

14              Q    I mean, in fact, the testimony is

15         inconsistent about the circumstances about him

16         stopping smoking, right?

17              A    Well, at a time in your life when you have

18         this many things going on, it can be very confusing.

19              Q    And I understand that completely. I'm

2 0        just saying, in terms of trying to determine exactly

21        what happened, the evidence is inconsistent, but

2 2        what we do know is that sometime in the fall of

23        1992, Mr. Perrotto stopped smoking and never smoked

2 4        another cigarette the last four years or three and a

25        half years of his life, right?

1              A    It's my opinion he stopped smoking because

2         he was too sick to smoke.

3              Q    Well, and we talked about that, but he

4         wasn't too sick to drink beer.

5                   MR. GDANSKI: Objection -

6         BY MR. COFER:

7              Q    How would he be too sick to smoke?

8                   THE COURT: Mr. Gdanski, I'm sorry?

9                   MR. GDANSKI: I said it's been asked and

10              answered.

11                   THE COURT: Sustained.

12         BY MR. COFER:

13              Q    Well, how would he be too sick to smoke?

14              A    It's easy. He had radiation pneumonitis,

15         he was undergoing chemotherapy, he's in pain, he's

16         debilitated. He can't walk because he's dis ï¿½

17         those are the records from the physicians.

18                   So he wasn't a healthy man after he had

19         had his radiation therapy, and he furthermore wasn't

2 0        healthy after he had his pneumonectomy or lobectomy

21         either.

22                   So I've had patients who did not stop 2 3        smoking until ï¿½

2 4             Q    They die.

25             A    ï¿½ they say, "I'm too sick to smoke,"

Page   2308

1         right before they die. So that's the heavily

2          addicted smoker that we see very often.

3               Q    But he did lots of things between '92 and

4          '96, right? He drank beer, he went to ball games,

5         he went to New Jersey, he visited his family. I

6         mean, he wasn't bedridden by any stretch, was he?

7               A    He wasn't bedridden, but he was disabled.

8         He was unable to function in his previous capacity.

9               Q    But you see lots of people who are unable

10          to function in their previous capacity that continue

11          to smoke, right?

12               A    True.

13               Q    And he wasn't one of those guys, right?

14               A    He was in pain because of the radiation

15         pneumonitis, the chemotherapy, and all of that

16         rolled into how he reacted to that.

17               Q    Let's shift gears, and I want to talk

18          about filters and light cigarettes, okay?

19               A    Okay.

2 0             Q    We're trying to get you out of here at

21          4:00. You need a break or anything?

22                    THE COURT: Let's make sure the jurors are 2 3              okay. Can we keep going?

1                    MR. COFER: The Doctor has a schedule

2              we're trying to keep if we can.

3         BY MR. COFER:

4               Q    Okay. It's true, isn't it, Dr. Hurt, that

5         in the 1950s, there was a view among some doctors

6         and public health authorities that if the tar was

7         lowered, cigarettes would not be as harmful, right?

8              A    There was that view, but it was completely

9         wrong.

10               Q    And we are going to walk through that and

11         you will have the opportunity to offer your

12         opinions. Let's just kind of back up so we're all

13         on the same page.

14                    So the deal is, and I think you told the

15         jury this last week, that nicotine doesn't cause

16         cancer and other diseases, people smoke for

17         nicotine, and it's the tar and the gas phase

18         components that cause the disease, right?

19              A    It's the 7,000 chemicals and over 60 known 2 0        carcinogens that cause disease.

21             Q    But not the nicotine, right?

2 2             A    It's not the nicotine.

2 3             Q    Okay. So the deal is, people have

2 4        recommended if there was a way to get smokers the

2 5        nicotine they want or need, but if you could limit

Page   2310

1         the amount of bad stuff you're getting, the tar, the

2         carbon monoxide, that could reduce the risk, right?

3              A    There are people who have said that, yes.

4               Q    And the idea is dose-response, it's just

5         dose-response. And this goes back to a guy named

6         Paracelsus in the 16th century who said, "All things

7         are poison, the poison is in the dose," right?

8              A    I don't recall that.

9              Q    Okay. I'll ask Proctor about Paracelsus.

10                    But in any event, if you have a glass of

11         wine, you can enhance a meal. If you chug a bottle

12         of Tequila, you can die of acute alcohol toxicity,

13         right?

14              A    You can.

15               Q    So it's not just the exposure, it's the

16         dose as well, correct?

17              A    Dose and duration.

18               Q    So the thinking was: Okay, if people

19         smoke for nicotine, but the bad stuff is the tar, if

2 0        you can find a way to give people the nicotine that

21        they want or need, to reduce the tar you might

2 2        reduce the risk. That was the rationale, right? 2 3             A    A wrong rationale.

2 4             Q    Okay. And walk through that, but I just

2 5        want to get us on the same baseline. That was the

1         idea, the thinking behind it, right?

2              A    That was the idea.

3              Q    Okay. I don't know whether the jury has

4         heard about it yet, but they will hear about

5         Dr. Ernst Wynder, he was a big deal. He did the

6         mouse skin-painting study, and he did a lot of the

7         epidemiology, the epidemiological studies, right?

8              A    Correct.

9              Q    What Wynder basically did was he looked at

10         people who had cancer and then he determined whether

11         they were smokers or nonsmokers, and he found that

12         the majority of them were smokers; right?

13                   That's the example of a retrospective

14         epidemiological study, right?

15              A   You said a lot of stuff, and it was hard

16         to follow all of that. That was a longï¿½

17              Q    All right. Let me just backup. I will

18         strike all that.

19                   The bottom line is Wynder was a public 2 0        health authority who did a lot of research on

21         smoking and health, right?

22              A    He did.

2 3             Q    In a bunch of the early studies and widely

2 4        regarded as a pioneer in identifying smoking and

2 5        lung cancer, right?

Page   2312

1              A    He was one of them, yes.

2              Q    Okay. Back in 1957, Wynder ï¿½ and this is

3         PMU1051 - published a study, "Tobacco

4         Carcinogenesis." And tobacco carcinogenesis is

5         cancer-causing agents, right?

6              A    Right.

7              Q    Cancer-causing.

8                   And, basically, what Wynder said was:

9                   "Measures that can succeed in reducing tar

10         exposure, may include the following: More effective

11         filters. It seems feasible, to produce a filter

12         that removes 40 percent of the tar from a given

13         cigarette and still allow the cigarette to maintain

14         the satisfactory pressure drop and flavor.

15                   "Modification in the types of tobacco, so

16         that the blend used is as low as possible in tar and

17         nicotine.

18                   "Regulation of the size of the cigarette

19         so that the lowest amount of tar is yielded. These

2 0        measures, together with the moderation of smoking

21         habits, can effectively reduce the cancer risk of

22         smokers. It may be predicted that if the average

2 3        smoker were exposed to only one-half of the amount

2 4        of tobacco tar, to which the smoker regular-sized

2 5        cigarettes is now exposed, his cancer risk would be

27    (Pages   2309   to   2312)

1         significantly reduced. Any measure designed to thus

2         reduce man's exposure to tobacco tar, whether

3         through modifications of the tobacco or the

4         cigarette, or through more effective filtration, can

5         significantly contribute to the decrease in risk."

6                   Did I read that correctly?

7              A    As best I can tell, yes.

8              Q    Okay. And that's just an example. Here's

9         one smoking health pioneer saying if you reduce the

10         amount of tar in nicotine, whether it is changing

11         the blend or through filters, that's a good thing,

12         because you're going to reduce the exposure to the

13         smoker, right?

14              A    That's what he said.

15              Q    Okay. And there were others as well. In

16         the interest of time I won't go through them all,

17         but he made the recommendation to Congress, Time

18         Magazine reported on it, he had the American Cancer

19         Society had a poster in 1962 - this is PMU2195. 2 0                 "To smoke or not to smoke. American

21         Cancer Society in 1962. Filters: While the value

22         of smoke filtration is undetermined, most scientists 2 3        believe that a decrease in the intake of tar, either

2 4        by filtration or a reduction in smoking, reduces the

2 5        risk of lung cancer."

Page   2314

1                   Did I read that correctly?

2              A    You did.

3              Q    This is another example of public health

4         organizations, like the American Cancer Society,

5         saying, hey, reduce tar, that can be a good thing to

6         reduce risk, right?

7              A    That's what it said.

8              Q    Okay. And, again, in the interest of

9         time, there are lots of other ones, but I won't go

10         through that.

11                   Let's just move on. Well, actually, they

12         said: Doing these will not make smoking safe ï¿½ let

13         me show you this. This is actually from ï¿½ PMU49.

14         This is from the Department of Health, Education and

15         Welfare. Because this is an important point.

16                   "If you must smoke, five ways to reduce

17         the risk of smoking." They talk about choose a

18         cigarette with less tar and nicotine.

19                   Don't smoke your cigarette all the way 2 0        down.

21                 Take fewer draws, reduce your inhaling.

2 2                  Smoke fewer cigarettes a day.

2 3                 But then they said: "One final thought:

2 4        If you must smoke, by all means follow these simple

2 5        mles, but the simplest mle of all is to quit

1         completely. You may add years to your life and

2         enjoy them more." Right?

3              A    That's what it says.

4               Q    Okay. So basically what the message was

5         is you should quit smoking, but if you are not going

6         to quit, you should try and reduce the amount of tar

7         that you inhale, right?

8              A   That was the wrong message, but that was

9         the message.

10               Q    That was the message that the public

11         health community and others were communicating

12         throughout the '50s and '60s and '70s, even into the

13         '80s, right?

14               A    Well, it began to wane in the '80s when we

15         learned more about low-tar, low-nicotine cigarettes.

16               Q    Okay. There's actually epidemiological

17          studies report that people who smoke filtered

18          cigarettes get less lung cancer than people who

19         smoke unfiltered cigarettes, right?

2 0             A   I would have to see that to agree with

21        that.

2 2             Q    Okay. Let me show you. This is 20324,

2 3        The World Health Organization ï¿½

2 4                  MR. GDANSKI: I object. Lack of

1                   MR. COFER: 20324.

2                   MR. GDANSKI: Right. I got the document,

3              but I still object on lack of predicate.

4                   THE COURT: Sustained.

5         BY MR. COFER:

6              Q    What is the World Health Organization?

7              A   Well, it is just what it says, it is a

8         organization that has to do with the health in the

9         world. That's what it's called that.

10              Q    It is kind of like the Surgeon General to

11         the world, right?

12              A   Yeah. It has a lot more resources than

13         the Surgeon General does. The Surgeon General

14         really is not a very powerful office.

15              Q    Okay. So this ï¿½ actually, you say The

16         World Health Organization has more resources than

17         Surgeon General, right?

18              A    By orders of magnitude.

19              Q    Okay. And they have within it the

2 0        International Agency for Research on Cancer,

21         correct?

22              A    Correct.

23              Q    Let me show you a publication, and this is

2 4        from 2003 World Cancer Report from the International

2 5        Agency for Research on Cancer, published by The

1          well-advised to switch to cigarettes yielding less

2          tar and nicotine, provided they do not increase

3          their smoking or change their smoking in other ways.

4          But our new review raises new questions and suggests

5          an even more cautious approach to the issue.

6                     "Here are the basic findings: There is no

7          safe cigarette and no safe level of consumption.

8          Smoking cigarettes with lower yields of tar and

9          nicotine reduces the risk of lung cancer and to some

10          extent improves the smoker's chance for longer life,

11          provided there is no compensatory increase in the

12          amount smoked. However, the benefits are minimal in

13          comparison with giving up cigarettes entirely. The

14          single most effective way to reduce hazards of

15          smoking continues to be that of quitting entirely.

16                     "Smokers may increase the number of

17          cigarettes they smoke and inhale more deeply when

18          they switch to lower-yield cigarettes. Compensatory

19          behavior may negate any advantage of the lower-yield 2 0         product or even increase the health risk."

21                   And finally: "Cancer. Today's

2 2         filter-tipped, lower-tar and nicotine cigarettes

2 3         produce lower rates of lung cancer than do their

2 4         higher tar and nicotine predecessors. Nonetheless,

2 5         smokers of lower-tar and nicotine cigarettes have

Page   2326

1          much higher cancer incidence and mortality than do

2          nonsmokers.

3                     "Smokers of lower-tar and nicotine

4          cigarettes may tend to smoke larger numbers of

5          cigarettes, to inhale more deeply, to have higher

6          amounts of carboxyhemoglobin than predicted from

7          machine measurements, and they have higher than

8          predicted carbon monoxide in exhaled air."

9                     Did I read that correctly?

10               A    You did.

11                Q    Basically in '81 the Surgeon General is

12          saying, hey, people may compensate. If you

13          compensate, you can negate the benefits. The bottom

14          line is the epidemiology shows that low tar in

15          filtered cigarettes produces lower rates of lung

16          cancer than higher tar in unfiltered cigarettes,

17          right?

18               A    Well, up until that time.

19               Q    Okay. I want to talk briefly about the 2 0         FTC method.

21                     Okay, so you talked to the jury a little

22          bit about the FTC method, FTC smoking machine. You 2 3         remember that?

2 4              A    Yeah.

25              Q    And, basically, what you told the jury was

Electronically signed by Gina Rodriguez (201-182-126-9514)

Page   2327

1          there came a time that the FTC said we're going to

2          put tar and nicotine measures on cigarette packs,

3          and so we're going to come up with a way to do that,

4          right?

5               A    That's correct.

6               Q    And then they invited cigarette companies

7          and others to give their comments about their

8          proposal about how they were going to do it. And

9          the cigarette company, including some of the

10          defendants in this case, did that, right?

11               A    I think that's correct.

12                Q    And so what happened was the FTC came up

13          with the method, it was named after a guy named Ogg,

14          O-G-G, who is the guy that invented it. And he came

15          up with a machine where they would take

16          cigarettes ï¿½ they put a bunch of cigarettes in the

17          machine, and then they would take 3 5-millimeter

18          puffs off of cigarettes, and they would take one

19          puff a minute, correct?

2 0              A   I would have to go back and look at my

21          slide as far as how often it was.

22                Q    The bottom line is ï¿½

23               A   It may have been a puff every two minutes. 2 4         I can't remember exactly.

25              Q    Okay. Well, whether it was a minute or

Page   2328

1          two minutes, the bottom line is, they said, okay, we

2          are going to take a certain puff, at a certain time,

3          off a cigarette, and then collect whatever came

4          through into a Cambridge filter, correct?

5                A    That's correct.

6                Q    And then they were going to measure the

7          tar in nicotine, and they were going to report how

8          different brands performed under that testing

9          scenario, right?

10                A    That's correct.

11                Q    And so then they invited the cigarette

12          companies to say: Well, what do you think about

13          this?

14                     And the companies did. And here's

15          supplemental observations following November 30th,

16           1966 hearing.

17                     And the companies told the FTC before they

18          adopted the method: "The Ogg method does not

19          measure the volume of smoke or the particulate

2 0         matter" ï¿½ that's what "PM" stands for there, right?

21                A    Yes.

22                Q    "Or the particulate matter or nicotine" ï¿½ 2 3         and particulate matter is the tar, that's the

2 4         particle phase of cigarettes, right? 25              A    Correct.

1                    Did I read that correctly?

2              A    You did.

3              Q    The FTC, before it adopted its method,

4         clearly understood that the FTC method would not

5         tell any smoker the amount of tar and nicotine he or

6         she was getting right, Doctor?

7              A    That was what it said.

8               Q    Okay. Ammonia. You spent a lot of time

9         on ammonia, so let's talk a little bit about that.

10                    First of all, you talked about diammonium

11         phosphate among other things, right?

12              A    Correct.

13               Q    So diammonium phosphate is actually used

14         in cake mixes and baked goods, too, right?

15              A    Say that again.

16              Q    Diammonium phosphate is actually used in

17         cake mixes and baked goods, too, right?

18              A    I don't know what all it's used in.

19              Q Well, the Food and Drug Administration has 2 0         something called GRAS, or generally recognized as 21         safe, right, Doctor?

2 2             A    Generally recognized as safe for

2 3        ingestion.

2 4             Q    That's right. And to be fair, you don't

2 5        eat cigarettes, you smoke them, right?

Page   2334

1              A    Correct. You eat cake, you don't smoke

2         cake.

3              Q    You eat cake. Although cakes can't always

4         be good for you either, but that's another topic.

5                  And the GRAS list applies to food. And

6         ammonia compounds like diammonium phosphate are on

7         the FDA safe list, right?

8              A    They are on that GRAS list.

9              Q    If s been publically known that ammonia is

10         used in tobacco for a long, long time, right?

11              A    Well, not to the extent that we learned

12         after 1998.

13              Q    Since the 1960s, Philip Morris has had

14         patents about its use of ammonia in its products,

15         right?

16              A    It could have.

17              Q    And you told the jury that ammonia also

18         occurs naturally in the tobacco plant, correct?

19              A    It does in varying amounts.

2 0            Q    The purpose of using diammonium phosphate

21        in cakes and baked goods is that it causes the cake

2 2        to rise or pop up, and it also imparts a toasty

2 3        flavor, correct?

2 4            A    I don't know the purpose of it.

2 5            Q    Let's talk about reconstituted tobacco.

1         You told the jury what reconstituted tobacco is, is

2         you can take the debris, the stems, some of the

3         dust, some of the leftover leaves, you take all of

4         that tobacco material, not the leaves, not the

5         lamina, and you can put it all together, and then

6         you add hot water and you make a slurry, and then

7         you pull all the solubles, everything's absorbed in

8         water or liquid off, you make like a paper, right?

9              A   Either that or a band cast. There are two

10         different types of recon.

11              Q    Let's talk about the paper because it's

12         easier.

13              A    If s easier.

14              Q    And so what you do, then, you had over to

15         the right essentially the stuff that you pulled off

16         while you were in the process of turning it into

17         paper, correct?

18              A    Correct.

19              Q    And then you can add some of that back, 2 0        including the nicotine, to the reconstituted

21        tobacco. It allows you to control how much nicotine

2 2        and how much of what you took off you're putting

2 3        back in, right?

2 4             A    And you can add other substances to the

25        slurry, yes.

Page   2336

1              Q    You certainly could.

2              A    Certainly do. And that's...

3              Q    Well, we talked about that, too.

4                   So you have sheeted tobacco, and it's

5         reconstituted, and you can control, since you have

6         recon tobacco, basically what you put in it, right?

7              A    Correct. So recon makes up a fraction of

8         the total amount of the material in the cigarette.

9              Q    Exactly. And the tmth is, when you take

10         all the stuff off, reconstituted tobacco has less

11         nicotine in it than the materials from which it was

12         made, right?

13              A   Well, it has its ï¿½ before it goes through

14         that last process where you can add whatever you

15         want to to the slurry, it removes most of the

16         nicotine, yes.

17              Q    Okay. Now, the other thing ï¿½ so one

18         purpose of using ammonia compounds in reconstituted

19         tobacco is you told the jury it releases the natural 2 0        pectins in the tobacco that helps it stick together,

21         right?

22              A    That's one of the things that it does,

23         yes.

2 4             Q    And what a pectin is, is simply

2 5        polysaccharide that's found in all plants, correct?

2
	Q    And pectins act like glue, and they're
	2
	A   It filters out some of the tar phase. It

3
	used or added to things like jams and jelly, that's
	3
	doesn't filter out all of it.

4
	what makes it gooey, right?
	4
	Q    Not everything, not everything, but it

5
	A    I don't know about jams and jelly.
	5
	filters some of the tar through compaction theory

6
	Q    Now, another thing that ammonia can do is
	6
	and Brownian motion, basically, right?

7
	it can impart a toasty flavor to tobacco smoke. So
	7
	A    Correct.

8
	it can be a flavor characteristic as well, right?
	8
	Q    But some of it then comes ï¿½ but the gas

9
	A    Well, people talk about that and they talk
	9
	phase basically ï¿½ and frankly, it does get a little

10
	about the roasty, toasty taste. I really haven't
	10
	bit of gas phase, but for our purposes, most of the

11
	seen a lot of evidence of that ï¿½
	11
	gas phase comes from the cellulous acetate filter,

12
	Q    It's actually called the Maillard effect,
	12
	correct?

13
	it's recognized in science, right?
	13
	A    I think that's correct.

14
	A    I have heard of the Maillard effect.
	14
	Q    So when you have tobacco smoke, in a

15
	MR. GDANSKI: Let him finish answering the
	15
	conventional cigarette, the pH is between 6 and 6.5,

16
	question.
	16
	right?

17
	MR. COFER: I'm so sorry.
	17
	A   Well, that's what it is now, but that

18
	THE COURT: That's fine. Doctor, are you
	18
	wasn't the way it was before.

19
	finished with your response?
	19
	Q    Okay. So let's talk about what pH means.

20
	THE WITNESS: I don't know.
	20
	It goes back to eighth grade science. So

21
	MR. COFER: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to
	21
	essentially pH measures whether something is acidic 1

22
	cut you off. I'm just trying to get you home.
	22
	or whether it's basic, or alkaline, right?

23
	THE WITNESS: That's fine.
	23
	A    Correct.

24
	BY MR. COFER:
	24
	Q    It's a scale of 0 to 14, correct?

25
	Q    We were talking about the toasty effect,
	25
	A    Correct.


	Page   2338
	
	Page   2340     \

1
	and I said it's called the Maillard reaction,
	1
	Q    7 is the middle, and that's neutral,

2
	M-a-i-1-l-a-r-d, right?
	2
	that's water, right?

3
	A    That's what you said. I have heard of
	3
	A    Right.

4
	that, yes.
	4
	Q    That's 7. Everything below 7 is slightly

5
	Q    In any event, so you have ammonia used
	5
	acidic, things like orange juice are slightly

6
	for ï¿½ and we're going to talk about free nicotine
	6
	acidic, correct?

7
	next, but you can use it to release natural pectins;
	7
	A    Right.

8
	in addition, it has some flavor characteristics,
	8
	Q    Things above 7 become more alkaline, or

9
	right?
	9
	the other word is called base or basic. Milk is

10
	A   It has some flavoring characteristics.
	10
	more basic, it's north of 7, right?

11
	Q    But then you talked to the jury about the
	11
	A    Right.

12
	use of ammonia compounds to change the form of
	12
	Q    So in a typical cigarette, pH of 6 to 6.5,

13
	nicotine. You said essentially to make it more
	13
	97 to 99 percent of the nicotine is in the particle

14
	addictive, right?
	14
	phase, right?

15
	A    That's correct.
	15
	A   Well, it depends upon the offgassing that

16
	Q    So let's talk about that. So tobacco
	16
	takes place. We know that the offgassing does take

17
	smoke comes in two phases. There's the particle
	17
	place in the pH environment, so some of that that's

18
	phase, which is the tar, that's the phase that has
	18
	on the particles can be offgassed or become vapor.

19
	mass, right?
	19
	Q    Okay. And I'm going to talk about that.

20
	A    Right.
	20
	But I'm just saying that in a typical pH of 6 to

21
	Q    Then there's the gas phase, correct?
	21
	6.5, now, we're going to talk about what ammonia can ij

22
	A    That's correct.
	22
	do, is 97 to 99 percent of the nicotine is in what's

23
	Q    And so with the cellulose acetate filter,
	23
	called the particle phase?

24
	that filters out the tar phase, but by and large,
	24
	A    It's in the bound ï¿½ it's bound, partially

25
	the gas phase will go right through the filter,
	25
	bound, so it may or may not be in the particles.

1         tar/nicotine ratios of less than 10 is valuable and

2         should be conducted. In view of the manipulatory

3         potential of reinstituted sheet technology, such

4         cigarettes are feasible."

5                   What they're talking about is, okay, here

6         is one way we can do it. We can use recon. We can

7         take all the stuff off using recon, and then we just

8         add nicotine back, or we can find a way to make more

9         nicotine because you can manipulate recon, right?

10              A    You can.

11              Q    "The source of the nicotine was

12         questioned. Dr. Tso stated that the source could be

13         a high-nicotine tobacco variety."

14                    Some plants have more nicotine than

15         others, right?

16              A    That's correct.

17              Q    In fact, even a given plant, different

18         leaves at different positions on the stalk will have

19         more or less nicotine, correct?

2 0             A    The higher on the stalk, the more

21         nicotine.

22              Q    "The maximum nicotine content is

2 3        7 percent, and although such tobacco also produces a

2 4        great deal of tar, it could serve as a nicotine

2 5        source. The tar is not a problem if such tobacco is

Page   2346

1         stripped and suitable quantities of the removed

2         nicotine are added back to a modified tobacco

3         sheet."

4                    So what they're saying there is typically,

5         if you get high-nicotine tobacco, it's also high in

6         tar, right?

7                    Tar and nicotine typically travel

8         together?

9              A    They typically go together, yes.

10               Q    Yeah, tar and nicotine travel together.

11          See, that's the problem is, if you're reducing the

12         tar, you reduce the nicotine. So they're looking

13         for ways that they can decouple the tar and nicotine

14         and basically just get the nicotine.

15                    MR. GDANSKI: Is that a question or just a

16               statement to the jury?

2               A    They were talking about that, yes.

3               Q    One way to do it is manipulating using

4         reconstituted tobacco, right?

5               A    That's correct.

6               Q    Nicotine nature and delivery.

7                    "This was the pivotal issue discussed at

8         the meeting. Nicotine has the greatest

9         pharmacologic activity when it is in the free base

10          form. The base form is also the 'distillable' form

11          which readily transfers to cigarette smoke."

2         additional cigarettes for further study, i.e.,

3         different types and levels of nicotine salts and

4         different types and levels of extenders. It may

5         also be desirable to attempt to increase or decrease

6         the pH of the mainstream smoke at this decision

7         point."

8                    Right?

9              A    That's what it says.

10               Q    So again, this is the National Cancer

11         Institute Tobacco Working Group working with the

12          cigarette companies looking at using pH to get a

13         less hazardous cigarette by increasing the nicotine

14          and lowering the tar, right?

15              A    That's what they said, but they weren't

16         talking about the threshold dose of nicotine and how

17          free nicotine could ï¿½ could it be adjusted for

18         that.

19               Q    You mentioned nicotine-free cigarettes 2 0         last week. Right?

21             A    Yes.

2 2             Q    Philip Morris actually made nicotine-free

2 3        cigarettes, didn't they?

1         cigarette, right?

2              A    I think that's correct.

3              Q    They bought General Foods so they could

4         get access to Sanka and Sanka's decaffeination

5         process, correct?

6              A    They used the same process.

7               Q    And they spent $300 million to build a

8         plant so they could produce nicotine-free

9         cigarettes, right?

10              A    I don't know that.

11               Q    No one bought them, right?

12              A   No one bought them.

13               Q    Because they didn't have nicotine in them,

14         correct?

15              A    That's correct.

16              Q    You told the jury it would be a good thing

17         from a public health standpoint if you made

18         nicotine-free cigarettes, right?

19              A    Correct.

2 0             Q    This is PMU56872.

21                  The public health community went nuts when

2 2        Philip Morris introduced a nicotine-free cigarette,

2 3        right?

2 4             A    I don't know that they went nuts, but...

2 5             Q    Here's an article from AP: "Philip Morris

Page   2350

1         has undertaken a marketing campaign for

2         denicotinized cigarettes designed to mislead

3         consumers into believing these products are safer,

4         healthier, and less addictive, said the Coalition

5         for Smoking or Health.

6                   "The coalition, made up of the American

7         Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, and

8         the American Lung Association, said it wants to put

9         a halt to cigarettes promoted as denicotined before

10         they claim a niche in the tobacco market.

11                   "Matt Myers, staff director for the

12         coalition, said denicotinized cigarettes may be the

13         most hazardous tobacco product put on the market in

14         the last ten years. Consumers may compensate for

15         the low nicotine levels of the cigarettes by smoking

16         more often, exposing them to more carcinogens."

17         Right?

18              A    That's what it says.

19              Q    So not everybody shared your enthusiasm 2 0        for low-nicotine cigarettes when Philip Morris

21         actually put them on the market, right?

22              A    It's not low nicotine, it's almost the 2 3        absence of nicotine in the product.

2 4             Q    It was like 97 percent.

2 5             A    Yes, almost all of it.

1               Q    Okay. Hang on just a second. I'm going

2         to try to get us out of here.

3                    Just a couple of things. Since 2009, the

4         FDA has had regulatory authority over the cigarette

5         companies, right?

6              A    They have.

7                    MR. GDANSKI: I object.

8                    THE COURT: Overruled.

10               Q    Yesterday you showed ï¿½ last Friday, I

11          guess. I keep thinking last Friday was yesterday ï¿½

12         you showed the jury that Philip Morris actually on

13         its website discloses its ingredients brand by brand

14         now, right?

15              A   Correct. At least the ones that were

16         listed.

17               Q    And you know that the FDA since 2009 has

18         the power to ban any be ingredient or additive it

19         deems unsafe, right?

2              Q    The FDA has the power to ban ï¿½

3                   Thank you.

4                   They can't ban nicotine, they can lower

5         nicotine, but they can't ban nicotine, right?

6              A    They can't make it zero, correct.

7              Q    But forget nicotine, the FDA has the power

8         to ban any ingredient or additive it deems unsafe,

9         right?

10              A    They do.

11              Q    And while it wasn't disclosed brand by

12         brand, and certainly not on the website, it's also

13         true, this is October 12, 1985, all of the cigarette

14         companies have produced to the government a list of

15         all of the additives used in their cigarettes,

16         right?

17              A    They did, but they disclosed it to the

18         Health and Human Services secretary and it could not

19         be made public.

2 0             Q    I want to talk about your opinions,

21        medical opinions today. First let's talk about the

2 2        '92 lung cancer. You said that when they did the

2 3        needle biopsy, they had some trouble figuring out

2 4        what kind of cancer he had, right?

25             A    They said it was a non-small cell but

	Q    And they gave him chemo first, and they

2
	Q    Well, if you don't know, just tell me.
	2
	gave him radiation first and then they gave him

3
	But initially they thought it was small cell, right?
	3
	radiation later, right?

4
	A    I think that's correct.
	4
	A    Correct.

5
	Q    In fact, they started treating him for

	small cell, correct?
	6
	adenocarcinoma, right?

7
	A    They did.
	7
	A    They did.

8
	Q    And for treatment purpose, it is important
	8
	Q    Was there any '92 record or '93 record

9
	whether it is small cell or a non-small cell, right?
	9
	that described an adenocarcinoma as having papillary jj

10
	A    That's correct.
	10
	features?

11
	Q    That's because small cell is incredibly
	11
	A    I think the comparison was made later with

12
	aggressive and there's a presumption by the time
	12
	the brain metastasis and compared it to the one that

13
	it's diagnosed it's already spread throughout the

15
	A    That's correct.
	15
	Q    Isn't it true that there is no record that

16
	Q    So surgery is not an option with small
	16
	we've seen that was produced in '92 or '93 that

	17
	describes the chest tumor as having papillary

18
	A    That's correct.
	18
	features?

19
	Q    What happened is they sent that needle
	19
	A   I don't recall. I would have to go back

20
	biopsy to a couple other hospitals, Holy Cross and
	20
	and look.

21
	University of Virgina Medical Center, correct?
	21
	Q    Okay. So then what happened was, four

22
	A    I can't remember which ones.
	22
	years later, he ended up with a solitary mass to the

23

24
	you know what, it is not small cell, it looks like a
	24
	A    That's correct.

25
	large cell with neuroendocrine features, correct?

	A   I recall that.

	horse of a different color, because it is not small

	Q    They looked in his lung and they did not

	cell. And then when they looked at the cancer, they
	4
	see any evidence of tumor in the lung in 1996,

5
	did CAT scans, they saw nothing in the brain, liver
	5
	right?

6
	or bone, right?
	6
	A   Well, they ï¿½ to the best of their

7
	A    That's correct.
	7
	ability, they didn't do a thoracotomy at that time.

8
	Q    What they saw was just in the chest, in
	8
	Q    And the tumor in the brain was

9
	the hilar lymph nodes in the chest, correct?
	9
	adenocarcinoma with papillary features, right?

10
	A    I don't think that they saw hilar lymph
	10
	A    That's what it said.

11
	nodes involvement with the CT scan.
	11
	Q    Okay. Let's switch to the volvulus.

12
	Q    Well, it turned out there was. I don't

13
	know if they did or not.

	THE COURT: Can we turn off the phone,

	17
	constipation came after the volvulus?

	THE COURT: Counsel, sidebar.

5
	A    Yes.
	5
	A   According to the data that we have, yes.

6
	Q    Cigarettes with additives are addicting,

7

	7

	more addictive, it's more difficult for menthol

	A    My wife didn't encourage me to. She

	11
	signed us up for the smokers clinic.

	14
	MR. COFER: Give me one second.

15
	do you?
	15
	Doctor, that's all I have. Thank you very

16
	A    That's the only evidence we have as far as
	16
	much.

17
	the menthol cigarettes being different. They are
	17
	THE COURT: Thank you very much,

18
	all addictive, it's just a matter of gradation.
	18
	Mr. Cofer.

19
	Q   No one has ever found that one brand of

	Mr. Weaver.

20
	cigarettes is easier to quit smoking than another,
	20
	MR. WEAVER: Thank you, Your Honor.

	have they?

	THE COURT: Any of the jurors need a

22
	A   Not to my knowledge.
	22
	break? Oh, we have a couple. Hold on, Mr.

23
	Q    Cigarettes in the '30s were addictive,
	23
	Weaver. You can get set up. Let me give the

	right?

	jurors just a two-minute break to use the

	(The jury exited the courtroom at 3:44 p.m.)

2
	Q    Okay. You told the jury that if
	2
	MR. MAGUIRE: Assuming we're wrapping up \

3
	Mr. Perrotto would stop smoking before the age of
	3
	with this witness today. Axe you going to ask

4
	35, he would have had a normal life expectancy,
	4
	the jurors if they have any questions of this

5
	right?
	5
	witness?

6
	A    That's based on the data from the
	6
	THE COURT: Yes, I will. Absolutely.

7
	epidemiology studies that if you stop smoking early
	7
	MR. MAGUIRE: Thank you, Your Honor.

8
	enough you can expect to have a normal life

9
	expectancy.
	9
	(Go to Volume 17.)

10
	Q    But you told the jury specifically that
	10
	

11
	it's your opinion that if Mr. Perrotto would have
	11
	

12
	stopped smoking by age of 35, he would have had a
	12
	

13
	normal life expectancy, right?
	13
	

14
	A    I can't remember exactly what I said, but
	14
	

15
	that's ï¿½ that's the data that we commonly site,
	15
	

16
	yes.
	16
	

17
	Q    Mr. Perrotto would have turned 35 in 1974
	17
	

18
	and 1975, right?
	18
	

19
	A    Yes.
	19
	

20
	Q    So if he quit smoking in 1966, when the
	20
	

21
	first warning went on the pack, when he was 26 years
	21
	

22
	old, he would have had a normal life expectancy,
	22
	

23
	right?
	23
	

24
	A    He would have most likely had a normal
	24
	

25
	life expectancy.

	MR. WEAVER: May it please the Court.

	November 2, 1959? November 1959?

11
	BY MR. WEAVER:
	11
	A    Correct.

12
	Q    Dr. Hurt, good afternoon. I'm Kurt
	12
	Q    So that information about the polycyclic

13
	Weaver, and I represent the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
	13
	hydrocarbons was not closely held by R.J. Reynolds,

14
	Company. I'm going to try and multi-task here, so I
	14
	correct?

15
	hope you will bear with me.
	15
	A    Well, that information, I'm not sure if it

16
	Dr. Hurt, you remember talking with Mr.
	16
	came from RJ Reynolds to Reader's Digest.

17
	Gdanski about this document, 1959, by Dr. Rodgman,
	17
	Q    You are familiar with this, that Dr. ï¿½

	the "Optimum Composition of Tobacco and its Smoke"?
	18
	Mr. Gdanski ï¿½ I almost called him Dr. Gdanski, I am  l

	A   I do.

	find a way to eliminate the desires of smokers to
	2
	I don't mean any disrespect to the family.

3
	stop smoking."
	3
	Is that okay with you?

4
	And tell the jury what's under the
	4
	A    That's fine.

5
	Post-it.
	5
	Q    All right. Santo started smoking when he

6
	A   I would have to look.
	6
	was 13 or 14, which would have been about 1949 or ji

7
	Q    Really?
	7
	1950. Does that sound right?

8
	MR. GDANSKI: I object.
	8
	A    That's about right.

9
	Show it to him.
	9
	Q    Okay. Santo did not become a daily smoker  ji

10
	BY MR. WEAVER:
	10
	until a year later. Does that sound right?

11
	Q    "Three, provide other products away from
	11
	A   That's what I remembered, yes.

12
	conventional cigarettes which meet the same needs
	12
	Q    Santo's first brand of cigarettes was

13
	cigarettes now meet, but without the associated
	13
	Camel?

14
	negatives."
	14
	A    Correct.

15
	You didn't read that third paragraph to
	15
	Q    Santo said he smoked for about ten years.

16
	the jury, did you, sir?
	16
	So that would mean that Santo smoked Camel ji

17
	A   We did not.
	17
	cigarettes from about 1950 to '51 to 1960 or '61,

18
	Q    Okay. Let's talk about brands. And if we
	18
	does that sound right, based on your reading?

19
	can switch from the ELMO to Ms. Kelly, please.
	19
	A    Yes.

20
	She's going to help me with something.
	20
	Q    Now, Nicholas Perrotto, he was bom in

21
	I want to talk about the brands that you
	21
	November of 1939, correct?

22
	read in the depositions in this case. Your opinions
	22
	A    Correct.

23
	Friday were based on ten years of Camel's smoking
	23
	Q    You would agree that Santo testified that

24
	history; isn't that true, sir?
	24
	Nick did not start smoking a pack a day until

25
	A    That's what his brother, I think, said.
	25
	Nick Perrotto was 18 or 19 years old.

	Page   2377     ij

1
	Q    Okay. And today Mr. Gdanski asked you
	1
	A    I don't recall that, but if you ï¿½

2
	specifically if your opinion was based on the
	2
	Q    Pardon?

3
	cigarettes that Nick Perrotto smoked from age 13 to
	3
	A    I don't recall it, but if you have that,

4
	23.
	4
	that's fine.

5
	Do you recall that question?
	5
	Q    From Mr. Santo Perrotto's deposition at

6
	A    Yes, I think so.
	6
	lines 108, lines 8 to 16.

7
	Q    Okay. Dr. Hurt, you read the deposition
	7
	"Did there come a time when your brother

8
	of Santo Perrotto, the older brother of Nicholas
	8
	was smoking a pack a day?

9
	Perrotto, correct?
	9
	"Yeah.

10
	A    I did.

	"How old was he when he was smoking a pack  ij

11
	Q    Santo was bom November 20th of 1936.
	11
	a day?

12
	Does that sound right?
	12
	"Young.

13
	A    It could be.
	13
	"Like high school young or out of high

14
	Q    Does that sound ï¿½
	14
	school?"

15
	A    Sounds right.
	15
	"ANSWER:  18, 19."

16
	Q    Okay.
	16
	Does that sound familiar to you?

17
	MR. GDANSKI: If you can hand me a copy of
	17
	A   Vaguely.

18
	whatever ï¿½
	18
	Q    Okay. And Santo testified that he does

19
	MR. WEAVER: Absolutely.
	19
	not know how long Nick smoked Camels, correct?

20
	BY MR. WEAVER:
	20
	A    Someone said he smoked about ten years. I

21
	Q    Santo Perrotto was three years older than
	21
	thought Santo was one of those, but...

22
	Nick Perrotto, who was born in 1939, correct?
	22
	Q    Dr. Hurt, you don't know what amount of

23
	A    Yes.
	23
	Camels Nick Perrotto smoked; isn't that true?

24
	Q    Santo started smoking ï¿½ and for purposes
	24
	A    That's true.

25

4
	Q    You recall her testimony that she was born

	So they were together a little over 13

5
	on April 24, 1943?
	5
	years, correct?

6
	A   No, but that's probably when she was born.
	6
	A    Correct.

7

	Q    Barbara Heppinstill testified that

	9
	when they were having coffee together, correct?

10
	"ANSWER: 4/24/1943."
	10
	A    I don't recall that, but if you say so.

11
	Does that sound right?
	11
	Q    Page 200, lines 7 through 16.

12
	A    Sounds right.
	12
	"Do you recall anything at all when you

	Q    Okay. Mrs. Heppinstill testified that she
	13
	were married before you had children, anything at

14
	met Nick Perrotto when he was 15 or 16 years old.
	14
	all about Mr. Perrotto's daily routine?

15
	So she would have met Nick Perrotto when

	"We had to have coffee, he would have a

16
	it was 1958 or 1959, okay?
	16

17
	A    Correct, yeah.
	17
	off to, you know, whatever was going on."

18
	Q    Okay. Let's put that up there.
	18
	Does that refresh your recollection?

19
	And Barbara Heppinstill remembers that
	19
	MR. GDANSKI: No, where does it say there   ;

20
	Nick Perrotto, when they met, was not smoking Camel,
	20
	that that was the first one of the day? I

21
	correct?
	21
	object.

22
	A   I don't recall that.

	THE COURT: Overruled.

	Doctor?

12
	BY MR. WEAVER:
	12

	Since the first Surgeon General's report in 1964,

	MR. GDANSKI: You just crossed him. I'm

	Do you see that?

12
	showing him the testimony. Is that your

	13
	Q    And that's a ï¿½ is there any product in

	MR. WEAVER: That's the one we objected to

1                    THE COURT: Sure. Counsel sidebar.

2                    MR. GDANSKI: Til withdraw.

3                    THE COURT: Withdrawn? If s withdrawn.

4                    MR. MAGUIRE: May we still approach?

5                    THE COURT: Sure, of course, Mr. Maguire.

6                    (Thereupon, the following proceedings were

7         held at side bar:)

8                    MR. MAGUIRE: It was originally as

9              following up on the quits; it turned out to be

10               something completely different. Now what we're

11               doing is something that is completely outside

12               the scope. There was nothing on

13               cross-examination about the number of people

14               that died. This is now pure bolstering. This

15              was all stuff that was covered in direct

16              examination. And now he's using the Surgeon

17               General report to bolster that earlier

18               testimony on redirect. It's completely

19              improper.

2 0                  THE COURT: Response?

21                  MR. GDANSKI: They can ask - quitting -

2 2             dying is the flip side to quitting. Both sides

2 3             have different focuses, but...

2 4                  THE COURT: I understand, but the focus on

2 5             their side really was quitting; this is just

Page   2387

1              dying outright.

2                   MR. GDANSKI: No, the focus on the

3              cross-examination was both quitting and, you

4              know, people dying. How many people ï¿½ Dr.

5              Hurt talked about the fact that it doesn't

6              include the people that died from

7              tobacco-related diseases, but the numbers of

8              quit attempts don't include that. They're

9              skewed. That's exactly within the focus of

10              cross. And it is in evidence.

11                   MR. MAGUIRE: This is closing argument.

12              He made the point during cross about the number

13              of people who died. This is clearly about the

14              people who died. It was all covered in direct.

15                   MR. GDANSKI: I'm moving off of it.

16                   THE COURT: I am going to sustain the

17              objection for the record. All right.

18                   (Thereupon, the sidebar was concluded and the

19         following proceedings were held in open court:) 2 0        BY MR. GDANSKI:

21             Q    One of the things that Mr. Cofer asked you

2 2        about ï¿½ he knows a lot about science, right?

2 3             A    He does.

2 4             Q    At one point he was like, "I am not a

2 5        doctor." It looked like he might have been for a

Page   2388

1         second, right?

2                   So my question to you is: In 2014, did

3         the Surgeon General and its major conclusions come

4         out and just say, hey, here is the state of the art

5         in this country on what we believe to be the rise,

6         the cause of the rise in the adenocarcinoma lung

7         cancers which we know Nick Perrotto had?

8                   MR. MAGUIRE: Objection, bolstering.

9                   THE COURT: Sustained.

10         BY MR. GDANSKI:

11              Q    Dr. Hurt, do you see here what's here in

12         Chapter 6, Major Conclusion?

13                   MR. MAGUIRE: Objection, bolstering.

14                   THE COURT: Overruled. It's in evidence.

15         BY MR. GDANSKI:

16              Q    "The evidence is sufficient to conclude

17         that the risk of developing adenocarcinoma of the

18         lung" ï¿½ it's what Debbie's husband, Nick Perrotto,

19         had, right? 2 0             A    Yes.

21              Q    " ï¿½ from cigarette smoking has increased

22         since the 1960s. The evidence is sufficient to

2 3        conclude that the increased risk of adenocarcinoma

2 4        of the lung, in smokers, results from changes in the

2 5        design and composition of cigarettes since the

Page   2389

1         1950s."

2                   Right?

3              A    That's what it says.

4              Q    Anything more recent than this that speaks

5         to this issue?

6              A   No. We've been observing this for a long

7         time, that the percentage of lung cancers that are

8         adenocarcinoma has been going up.

9              Q    And you've made a nice amount of money

10         coming in to help and educate the jury in this case,

11         right?

12                   You get paid for your time, fair?

13              A    I do.

14              Q    Okay. And you charge what rate?

15              A    $700 an hour.

16              Q    And is that absolutely reasonable in light

17         of your expertise in this subject matter?

18              A    My friends think I'm crazy.

19              Q    Think it's too low?

2 0             A   No. One of them said, "I would rather

21         have three root canals a day than to do that."

22              Q    Right. It is hard work. You have to sit

2 3        through depositions, they depose you 300 pages, you

2 4        have to come here, you've got to be cross-examined,

2 5        and it is fair you get charged for it, right?

1         that ï¿½ when you lose control over a substance,

2         regardless of what that substance is, that's the

3         tipping point to becoming addicted; and so once you

4         lose control, choice is no longer relevant.

5              Q    And in 2010, the secretary of health puts

6         in the Surgeon General's report:

7                    "On the other hand, cigarette smoking

8         remains the chief preventable killer in America with

9         more than 40 million Americans caught in a web of

10         tobacco dependence." Right?

11                    That's the Surgeon General ï¿½ it's the

12          secretary of ï¿½ the Assistant Secretary for Health,

13         Howard Koh, in this country, right?

14              A    That's correct.

15               Q    Okay. How many smokers are out there in

16         this country? How many regular estimated daily

17          smokers do we know exist?

18              A    Well, it's basically the same number as it

19         was 50 years ago, it's over 40 million smokers

2 0        today. So the premise has gone down because the

5         Lancet, 1942, another British Medical Journal in

7         expect Nick Perrotto to be reading, British Medical

8         Journal articles?

9              A    No.

10              Q    Is that the kind of thing you would expect

11         any normal human being that has the opportunity to

12         make a decision based on information in this country

13         to be reading?

1         Nick Perrotto?

2              A   No. Except that he was addicted.

3              Q    Of course. Motives and Incentives of

4         Cigarette Smoke, that's a book by William Dunn,

5         right?

6              A    That's it.

7              Q    Okay. And Mr. Cofer showed you a book, he

8         had a book, I got a book. You see both of us care a

9         lot about these issues. So he bought the book and I

10         bought the book.

11                   MR. COFER: I object, lack of foundation.

16              A    Yes.

17              Q    And the idea on cross-examination was

18         that, "You know, this was a book, it was out there,

19         everybody knew what Dr. Dunn had to say," right? 2 0             A    That's correct.

21             Q    Did Philip Morris ever tell people that,

2 2        you know: "No doubt about it, it's the nicotine,

2 3        that's why people smoke."

	MR. GDANSKI: It's the author of the book

	about her asking her husband to switch to ultra

5
	not an expert. I'm not a handwriting expert.
	5
	safer and better for him?

6
	So this really is a moot point. Let's move on.
	6
	A    I recall that, yes.

7
	MR. GDANSKI: I can't show that?

	to smoke these because these are the ones that are

12
	by Dr. Dunn that says, "No doubt about it, it's

	better for you," right?

13
	nicotine"?
	13
	A   I could recall that, yes.

14
	THE COURT: It reads Dr. Dunn, but we
	14
	Q    And then Nick started doing that, that's

15
	don't know that it's Dr. Dunn.
	15
	what he did, right?

16
	MR. GDANSKI: Okay. I'll say--that's a
	16
	A    He did.

17
	fair deal.
	17
	Q    And you know what Monograph 13 is?

18
	MR. COFER: No, no, no. It is not a fair
	18
	A    Yes.

19
	deal. If we don't know, then there's no basis
	19
	Q    Okay. So the whole long discussion with

20
	to do it, there's no foundation. That's my
	20
	Mr. Cofer about whether or not light, low-tar light

8

11
	This is in 1993. "Nick can't walk up a

	12
	"Our action today ensures that tobacco

	to you is this, Dr. Hurt: Today, is there any way
	12
	this point it caused way too much attention to

13
	for the government to legally ban the use of
	13
	it. There's nothing prejudicial about it. And

14
	nicotine in cigarettes?
