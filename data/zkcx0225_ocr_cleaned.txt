4                       DIRECT EXAMINATION

5   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

6       Q    Good morning, Dr. Cummings.  Would you please

7   state your full name.

8       A    Kenneth Michael Cummings.

9       Q    Dr. Cummings, what is your current profession?

10       A    I'm a professor in the department of psychiatry

11   and behavioral sciences at the Medical University of

12   South Carolina.

13       Q    And where is that located, sir?

14       A    Charleston, South Carolina.

15       Q    Okay.  We're going to go through a little bit

16   of your experience and background this morning before we

17   start your testimony as it applies to this case, but

18   what I would like to do first is start with your

19   education, where you went to � where you attended

20   college, where you did your postgraduate studies, what

21   it was in, and that type thing.

22       A    Sure.  Okay.  Well, I started out actually at

23   Florida Southern College here for a semester, and then I

24   transferred to Miami University.  Miami, Ohio, the one

25   up in Oxford, Ohio, not down here, and I did my degree

1   in physical education and health education.  After that

2   I went to the University of Michigan where I did a

3   master's of public health and health behavior and health

4   education, and then I continued to do my Ph.D. at the

5   University of Michigan in the same area, public health

6   education, health behavior.

7             So that's the education that I've had.

8       Q    Okay.  After you received your doctorate at the

9   University of Michigan where did you go to work?

10       A    Well, I started out � actually as I was

11   finishing up my Ph.D. I was working at Wayne State

12   University in the department of community medicine

13   there, and then I was offered a job at Roswell Park

14   Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, and I move to

15   Buffalo in the early 80's, early part of '81, and I

16   stayed there until 2011.

17             So I sort of rose up the ranks from a junior

18   scientist to a senior research scientist there where I

19   directed their cancer prevention program.

20       Q    You said Roswell Park Cancer Center.  For those

21   who may not be familiar with it from this part of the

22   country, can you please tell us what the Roswell Park

23   Cancer Center is?

24       A    That's a designated � the National Cancer

25   Institute designates comprehensive cancer centers.

1   There's about 40 of them around the country.  Roswell

2   Park was one of the first designated cancer centers back

3   in 1971, and it basically � that designation requires

4   you to have excellence in research and treatment for

5   cancer.  So it's focussed on, you know, early detection,

6   prevention of cancer, as well as developing treatments

7   for cancer.

8       Q    From 1982 to 2011 what was your position at the

9   Roswell Park Cancer Center?

10       A    Well, I started out as a junior scientist in

11   the department of cancer prevention, and my area of

12   specialty was in health behavior, and I got involved in

13   doing smoking cessation programs, and set up the clinics

14   that operated at Roswell Park.

15             I continued to do that.  Of course it's a

16   research institution, so I was there to do research as

17   well, so a lot of my research focussed on why people

18   smoke, why they have difficulties quitting, methods for

19   helping people quit.

20             I was pretty successful at getting grants.  I

21   rows up the ranks, and, you know, in the latter part of

22   the 90's I was basically appointed as chair of the

23   Department of Health Behavior there, head of their

24   cancer prevention program, had about 200 people working

25   under me, M.D.'s, Ph.D.'s, master's.  We ran � I

1   created the New York State Smokers Quit Line, which

2   provided free � a toll free hotline for smokers to call

3   to get help.  I set that up in the late 90's, and survey

4   research center, tobacco testing lab.  So, you know, it

5   sort of follows along.

6             Then when I left in 2011 � my family had all

7   moved, my kids had settled in Charleston.  The Medical

8   University offered me a job, so I left the cold and went

9   to see the grandkids down in Charleston, and I've been

10   there for five years, where I've essentially tried to

11   replicate the same kinds of activities.

12             I have set up a hospital-based cessation

13   service for our patients.  Every patient that comes in

14   the hospital or emergency room is automatically offered

15   treatment services for smoking.  We follow them after

16   discharge and offer them basically access to medications

17   and followup support in a variety of ways.

18       Q    And while at Roswell Park did you completely

19   become the director of the tobacco cessation center?

20       A    Yes.  I set up the clinics.  They used to have

21   the Seven-day Adventist program come in once a year to

22   run clinics at Roswell when I first arrived there, and

23   so I established stop smoking clinics for patients and

24   operated those personally for 30 years.

25             So I probably have personally taken care of

1   about 10,000 or more smokers, running the clinics when I

2   was at Roswell, and then we set up the quit line to

3   basically make it easier.  We set that up for allowing

4   people across the state to access the services that we

5   had established.

6       Q    I just said a term for the first time.

7   Cessation.  Can you tell us what cessation means,

8   simply?

9       A    Yes.  You know, cessation is discontinuing the

10   behavior, in this case the behavior of smoking, which is

11   a struggle for most smokers because of nicotine

12   addiction.  And so developing treatments to help smokers

13   overcome their nicotine dependence.

14       Q    In addition to � and you mentioned that you

15   developed and headed up the stop � or the smokers quit

16   line for the state of New York.

17       A    That's right.

18       Q    In addition to assisting smokers trying to quit

19   smoking, have you also done research into cigarette

20   design, the qualities of cigarettes that make them

21   addictive, youth marketing, and other topics, all

22   related to cigarettes?

23       A    Yes.  I mean, I've done studies on why people

24   start smoking.  So that's primarily looking at, you

25   know, teenagers and why they take up smoking, and what

1   products they select, and the effects of marketing on

2   their decision making.

3             I've done studies on product design and how it

4   impacts the exposures that smokers get and why it's hard

5   to quit, so how the product is engineered to deliver

6   nicotine, how it's basically engineered to make it hard

7   to quit deliberately.  And so I have set up a tobacco

8   testing lab.

9             I think we're one of the few in the country

10   actually outside the cigarette industry where we started

11   to collect the products from all over the country,

12   actually all over the world, comparing the product

13   designs across different companies, different brands,

14   how the product brands changed year to year, and how

15   some of those design changes affected how people smoked.

16            And that lab is still in existence today.  I

17   set it up with funding from the National Cancer

18   Institute, really started in the mid 90's, and that

19   funding has continued.

2 0                           We just got renewed for funding.  We're now

21   expanding it to look at novel nicotine delivery devices,

22   electronic cigarettes, and so on.

23       Q    How many of your studies specifically related

24   to cigarettes and nicotine addiction have been published

25   in scientific and medical journals?

1       A    Well, my profession is publish or perish, so �

2   it's actually get grants or perish, but you publish the

3   findings from your studies.  So I've published about 420

4   peer-reviewed scientific articles, many chapters in

5   books, and that kind of thing as well.

6       Q    Let me ask you.  So in addition to articles

7   that have appeared in medical technical journals for

8   scientists and public health officials like yourself,

9   have you also published chapters in books related

10   specifically to cigarette design, nicotine addiction?

11       A    Yes.  I've been invited to do chapters

12   occasionally for books.  I've probably done about 30 of

13   those.  Those include monographs, you know, the National

14   Cancer Institute, the Surgeon General.  I've written

15   sections of Surgeon Generals' reports in the past.  I've

16   done chapters for encyclopedias on different aspects of

17   cigarette smoking, including cigarette design, tobacco

18   product marketing.

19       Q    Okay.  You mentioned receiving grants, and

20   we're going to talk a little bit more about some

21   specific studies you've done which were funded by the

22   government, but let me ask you just some examples of

23   grants.

24            What is the National Cancer Institute, or NCI?

25       A    The National Cancer Institute is part of our

1   National Institutes of Health, which funds health

2   research in the country, and the National Cancer

3   Institute is the part of the NIH that focuses on funding

4   cancer research.  It's the largest funding source for

5   research on developing treatments, early detection, and

6   prevention of cancer, and they're the ones that

7   designate the centers of excellence around the country.

8   I think here Moffitt is an NCI designated comprehensive

9   cancer center.

10       Q    Have you been appointed by various states

11   around the country to served as chair or co-chair on

12   their advisory task force for smoking and health issues?

13       A    Sure.  I serve on an advisory capacity for a

14   number of organizations.

15             The State of California, when they set up their

16   tobacco prevention program in the early 90's, they have

17   an external advisory group that comes in and advises

18   them about the program that they will have, how to

19   evaluate what's working, what's not working.  So I've

20   co-chaired that task force for � well, since the early

21   90's.  I think '92 is when I started it, and I'm still

22   the co-chair.  So they keep me around.

23             I do the same for the State of Louisiana.  Did

24   that for New York State when I was there as well.  They

25   had a coalition that was organized through the health

1   department with various health agencies in the state,

2   and I co-chaired that program for a number of years.

3   And I serve on the board of directors of the South

4   Carolina Tobacco Free Collaborative, which is a similar

5   type of organization that helps the state organize their

6   state tobacco control plan and evaluate how successful

7   that plan is in terms of its implementation.

8       Q    Are you also asked to serve as a consultant for

9   public health organizations like the American � the

10   American Cancer Society?

11       A    Sure.  I've served in various capacities

12   locally as well as nationally with the American Cancer

13   Society.  I chaired one of their review panels that give

14   out grants.  And they have a national review panel, and

15   I chaired that for a number of years.

16             I do the same thing for the National Cancer

17   Institute.  I'm a consultant to the World Health

18   Organization, to the Centers for Disease Control and

19   Prevention, their office on smoking and health.  So I

20   serve in a variety of advisory capacity.

21       Q    Let me ask you.  The jury has heard a couple

22   times now Surgeon General.  So let's just explain

23   briefly.  What is the Surgeon General of the United

24   States?

25       A    Well, he's basically the head of the U.S.

1   Public Health Service, which is the service charged with

2   protecting the public's health, and he's a political

3   appointee, so he's appointed by the president of the

4   United States.

5             So the Surgeon General has been active actually

6   since the 1950's, commenting on issues related to

7   smoking and health, probably well-known for their

8   reports that they first put out, the advisory report in

9   1964, and then some 36 reports that have come out since

10   1964 on the issue of smoking and health.

11       Q    Have you been asked by the Surgeon General to

12   serve in a capacity in relation to the reports that deal

13   with smoking and health?

14       A    Yes.

15       Q    How many Surgeon General reports have you been

16   involved with in your career related to smoking and

17   health?

18       A    I haven't counted them all, but the first one

19   that I was involved with was the 1988 report.  That was

20   the report on nicotine addiction, and I was invited at

21   that time to serve as a reviewer of a section of that

22   report, so a peer reviewer, where you get a section, you

23   read it, offer comments.

24             I've done that pretty much continuously since

25   that report came out.  So serving as a reviewer.  And

212-279-9424

1   then in 1989 I was invited to actually contribute a

2   section of the report.  So I wrote the section of the

3    '89 report on smoking cessation, and it was an

4   anniversary report, 25 years, so it was the history of

5   different stop smoking methods that had come out from

6   1964 up to 1989 when that report came out.

7             Then I've served in the capacity of advising

8   the Surgeon Generals about topics for reports that they

9   might put out.  Then I've served as an overall reviewer

10   of various reports.

11             The 2010 report, when they were finished

12   putting it together they sent it to four or five people

13   to offer top-line comments, and I've done that for a

14   number of reports.  I did it in 2010, 2014, and I

15   continue to serve in that capacity for the office, as

16   many other people do.

17       Q    Let me ask you.  I'm not going to go through

18   all of these, but just a couple awards.

19            Have you received awards throughout your career

20   for your service in public health?

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    Let me just ask you about one or two.  The 2009

23   Luther Terry Award For Outstanding Research Contribution

24   given by the American Cancer Society, did you receive

25   that award?

1       A    I did.

2       Q    And who was Luther Terry?  Why is the award

3   named after him?

4       A    Well, Luther Terry was the Surgeon General of

5   the United States in the early part of the 60's.  He was

6   the Surgeon General when they put out the 1964 advisory

7   report, and the American Cancer Society created an award

8   in his name.  It's given out every three years at the

9   World Conference on Smoking and Health, and I was very

10   honored to receive that award in 2009.

11       Q    And that was given out at the World Conference

12   for Smoking and Health?

13       A    Yes, the world conference.  That one was in

14   Mumbai, India, so that was quite an experience to go

15   there.  That's where they had the conference, and that's

16   when I received that award.

17       Q    And so, Dr. Cummings, is it fair to say that

18   your 40-plus year career since you graduated from

19   school, almost all of it has been devoted to public

20   health issues regarding cigarette addiction, cigarette

21   design, smoking cessation?

22            MR. WALKER:  Objection leading. 2 3                            THE COURT:  Overruled.

24       A    Yes, that's a fair characterization.

25       Q    Because of this length of time that you have

1   been doing research in this field have you been asked to |

2   serve as an expert witness in cases, in court cases?

3       A    Yes, I was � the first time I was asked was in |

4   1996, having to do with some cases here in Florida, the

5   original Engle case, for example, and then later the

6   cases in different states, including the state of

7   Florida.

8       Q    Have you been asked by states to serve as an

9   expert witness in official state cases?

10       A    Yes, I have.

11       Q    And we have asked you to serve as an expert

12   witness in this case.  Have we asked you to serve as an

13   expert witness in a few other cases too?

14       A    Yes, you have.

15       Q    And are we paying you for your time away from

16   the university?

17       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

18       Q    Are you still active at the university?  Do you |

19   still have a day job that you do other than testifying 2 0       as a expert?

21       A    I do.  I'll have a lot of e-mails as soon as I

22   off the stand waiting for me to respond to.  But, yes, I

23   have, you know, basically a regular position at the

24   medical university, as I mentioned, overseeing their

25   tobacco program, plus running their research program.  I

2   Cancer Center, which is the cancer center at the medical

3   university at South Carolina.

4       Q    Okay.  And we're going to spend the next day or

5   so here covering � hopefully we'll wrap up Monday,

6   but � we've got to wrap up because I know you have to

7   be somewhere.

8            Where do you have to be Tuesday?

9       A    Well, I've been invited to give a talk up in

10   Maine at the Tri-annual conference that the attorney

11   generals of the United States have on tobacco.  It's

12   every three years.  They bring in public health experts

13   to provide an update on trends in tobacco use, youth,

14   adults, new products.  I'll be talking about electronic

15   cigarettes, giving them an update.

16       Q    That's representatives from each attorney

17   general's office from all 50 states?

18       A    Yeah, all 50 states are there, so I think there

19   will be six or seven state attorney generals there and

20   their designee; in other words, somebody else in their

21   office that will be there, plus public health experts,

22   plus I think the representatives from the tobacco

23   companies also are invited to attend as well.

2 4       Q    Okay.  And, Dr. Cummings, we're going to be

25       talking about some issues today regarding John Price and

1   regarding the cigarette industry.

2             Let me ask you.  We've already heard some about

3   internal documents, or documents that were formerly

4   secret only to tobacco companies.

5             Can you just explain when these documents

6   started seeing the light of day, and then how you got

7   involved in studying them?

8       A    Sure.  Well, basically they began to see the

9   light of day in the mid to late 1990's, and there were

10   some agreements between state attorney generals and the

11   tobacco industry which released those documents, and I

12   worked closely with the state attorney general in New

13   York who received a large volume of the documents.

14             The Tobacco Institute and the Council for

15   Tobacco Research were originally founded or incorporated

16   in New York State, and there was an agreement, a side

17   agreement that released those documents to New York.

18   The state attorney general contacted me, knowing my work

19   on tobacco in New York, asked me if I wanted the

2 0       documents.  I didn't really know what the volume would

21   be.  I said of course.  This is an important source of

22   information.

23            And so over the next seven years truckloads of

24   documents appeared.  I ended up renting a warehouse

25   offsite from Roswell.  We had the basement of Roswell

1   Park.  16 million pages of documents in banker boxes

2   came on giant pallets.  I ended up getting some funding

3   from the National Cancer Institute, American Legacy

4   Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson, and other groups, that

5   supported digitizing these documents and creating a

6   virtual library.  Then other documents from each of the

7   defendants, each of the cigarette companies, also

8   appeared online.

9            Different searching mechanisms, both librarians

10   and experts in document management that I hired, a lot

11   smarter than I am, they figured out how to index it.  So

12   we actually created the indexing for all the documents.

13   I think now there are about 80 million pages of

14   material.  And that indexing � like you go into a

15   library, there are a lot of pages there.  You're not

16   required to read every page, but you should be able to

17   go to a card catalog and find the topics and get an idea

18   of what's in that library so you can find things.

19       Q    Was that an important part of � was that

20   important for public health researchers like yourself

21   and other scientists to be able to understand the

22   in-depth knowledge of the tobacco industry about some of

23   the issues we're going to be able to talk today, the

24   ability to search the documents?  I mean, is it possible

25   for anybody to read every single document?

1       A    Well, it's not possible to read 80 million

2   pages.  I read pretty quick, but that would be a little

3   bit of a task for anybody.

4             But with the indexing it made it possible to

5   actually search and develop topics so you could actually

6   find out an answer to basic questions, like when the

7   companies first knew about the risks of smoking, whether

8   they were truthful when they said they don't market to

9   children, whether they knew that their products were

10   addictive, when they knew, and how they engineered their

11   products in ways that make it hard to quit.  So the

12   index allows you to really study those questions

13   in-depth.

14            And so that's � yes, the government felt this

15   was very important.  In fact, the National Cancer

16   Institute dedicated resources to fund investigators to

17   do studies on these topics.  I received some of those

18   grants, and because of my knowledge and expertise, and

19   largely because the documents were turned over to me and

20   I was one of the first ones out of the box really to

21   look at this as a new source of data to try to educate

22   us about some of those questions, which were really

23   pressing questions about why the epidemic of tobacco-

24   related diseases had occurred in this country.  So it

25   was highly pertinent.

1       Q    When these documents first began to see the

2   light of day � and some of them are decades old; right?

3       A    Yeah.  Well, we didn't know what was in the

4   documents until we began to see them.  Then it became

5   eye opening.  And, you know, for somebody like myself

6   who had been doing research on why people smoke, and so

7   on, it really opened the door.  It was a new source of

8   data to either validate theories or invalidate theories

9   that we had had in the past, and to help advance, you

10   know, public health practice.  And it did.  It made a

11   big difference, and it continues to make a difference.

12             I'm still to this day, as other public health

13   scholars are, involved in looking at the documents.  I

14    just happened to be fortunate enough to be in the right

15   place at the right time, which is probably why I ended

16   up in this chair today, because I had, you know,

17   acquired unique knowledge and expertise in the actual

18   what the companies did, what they knew.

19       Q    And I believe we have a few pictures of the

20   Roswell Park document center, things like that.

21            Would that be helpful showing the jury extent

22   of what you've been doing with these documents?

23       A    Sure it would be.

24       Q    Okay.  So this is a Roswell Park tobacco

4       wall?  Oh, the TV's are working.

5       Q    Dr. Cummings, one thing I forgot to ask.  We

6   talked about these documents started coming out in the

7   mid to late 90's.

8            Were all these documents turned over

9   voluntarily, or did some come from other sources?

10       A    They were not turned over voluntarily at all,

11   and �

12       Q    Okay.  Let me stop you there.

13       A    Sure.

14       Q    Let's go through now, and are there still new

15   documents, new formerly secret tobacco documents that

16   are coming out today?

17       A    Sure.  When we started there, you know, when I

18   got the 16 million, plus there were another 30 million

19   or so, we had about 46 million, now we're up to 80

20   million.  So that shows you over time.

21            And there's a requirement that the companies,

22   as things are discovered, primarily through litigation,

23   have to be put up online.  And so that's the source.

24            We're always going back and updating the stuff

25   that we're doing in terms of our research.

1       Q    And I think we've got a slide.  You talked

2   briefly about the cigarette product while we were on

3   Roswell Park.

4             So tell me what the tobacco product testing lab

5   is.  This is what you set up at Roswell Park?

6       A    Right.  In the mid 90's I received a grant to

7   explore the defect of cigarette filters, filter fiber

8   fallout, and patents related to that, and public

9   perceptions about cigarette filters, and so on, and we

10   utilized a laboratory from a colleague of mine, John

11   Pauly, who was an immunologist at Roswell Park.

12            And that was okay for that grant, but we began,

13   because of that research, to get interested in actually

14   looking more in-depth at the product and how it was

15   engineered, you know, the blend of tobacco, whether it

16   stays the same year after year, whether it's tweaked and

17   modified, the additives that are used, and more on the

18   filter and engineering of the product.

19            And so in the early 2000's I convinced, you

20   know, my director at the hospital to give me space to

21   create a lab.  I hired people expert in biobehavioral

22   research to help run that lab.  I managed to get some

23   grant funding from the National Cancer Institute, which

24   began in 2004.

25            And this is just showing you the freezer.  This

1   is not actually the picture of the lab, it's just

2   showing you the freezer, because we actually buy the

3   tobacco products off the shelf.  We freeze them because

4   tobacco will dry out after a couple months and won't be

5   the same as it would be if a customer were going in to

6   buy it.

7            We have a very expensive piece of equipment

8   that, you know, unfreezes the product basically so it

9   would be as if it were purchased the day that you got it

10   off the shelf.

11            We have probably at this point 3- or 400,000

12   packs of cigarettes from some 23 different countries

13   around the world.  We buy the cigarettes as a protocol

14   for how to buy them, and we buy them on a regular basis

15   so we can look at changes in the design of these

16   products.  And then of course we do the research on not

17   only how they're constructed, the pH of product, the

18   filter, you know, efficiency of the product, the blend,

19   the chemistries, but also looking at � you know,

20   isolating some of those factors and how it affects how

21   people smoke the product and the exposures that they

22   get.  And this is helpful because essentially the

23   product is the independent variable in explaining why

24   it's hard to quit.

1   features of modern cigarettes later, but let me ask you,

2   since you just talked about this, for those who may not

3   smoke or don't know much about cigarettes, are

4   cigarettes just rolled up or chopped up tobacco?

5       A    No.

6       Q    Do we have a demonstrative or a video showing

7   the general process for making cigarettes that would be

8   helpful to show the jury how a cigarette is made?

9       A    Yes.  I think this was taken at Philip Morris,

10   their plant in Richmond back in the mid 90's, and it's

11   just a film of walking through the plant at Philip

12   Morris.

13             You can see the high speed.  It's all

14   automated.  They make cigarettes at a very rapid pace.

15       Q    And is it the same type of process for all the

16   major cigarette manufacturers, R.J. Reynolds, Lorrilard,

17   Philip Morris, et cetera?

18       A    Yes.

19            MR. PRYSOCK:  If we can shoe PT04518A.  And

20       we'll put this into evidence.

21             (Video played with no sound.)

22       Q    Okay.  What are we seeing here, Dr. Cummings?

23       A    Well, the first part of it is recon tobacco,

24   which is manmade tobacco.  So there are parts of the

25   tobacco plant like the stem and stalks when they remove

1   the leaves from the plant that are chopped up and

2   reconstituted into a tobacco sheet.  They extract

3   nicotine out of that material.

4       Q    What is this slurry coming out?

5       A    That's the tobacco.  It's actually put into a

6   slurry, and they put it out on drying trays, basically

7   to create a paper sheet.  It's the same process of

8   converting a tree into paper, tobacco wood, or wood pulp

9   made into paper.  So this is making the byproducts of

10   tobacco into paper.

11             In fact, cigarettes that do dry out on the

12   shelf are brought back to the plant and also

13   reconstituted.  So nothing is wasted in this process and

14   extracting the nicotine.  And they will reapply the

15   nicotine on the sheet so you get it in a uniform way

16   over that entire sheet, unlike a tobacco leaf, a natural

17   leaf, where the amount of nicotine in the leaf will vary

18   quite a bit from one part of the leaf to the next.

19             So by using reconstituted tobacco, which makes

20   up anywhere from 10 to 30 percent of the blend of the

21   cigarette, allows great precision and control in the

22   delivery of nicotine.

23             There are many additives that are also put in

24   the sheet that can affect the delivery of nicotine and

25   the inhaleability.

1       Q    We'll talk more about the additives and

2   chemicals a little bit later, but let me just ask you

3   since you touched on it.

4             So in making this reconstituted tobacco

5   nicotine is lost in the process; right?

6       A    That's right.  Well, it's actually extracted

7   through the process.

8       Q    What do they do?  How do they reapply; do they

9   spray the nicotine back into the sheets?

10            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor, leading and

11       asked and answered.

12             THE COURT:  Sustained.

13            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

14       Q    What � how do they � what do they do?  Do

15   they leave the nicotine out?

16       A    No, they capture it.  They call it �

17            MR. WALKER:  Same objection, Your Honor.

18             THE COURT:  Overruled.

19       A    They capture it.  It's called the rich brown

20   liguor.  Then they reapply that on the slurry.  They

21   actually have to paint up the sheet to give it the

22   appearance of tobacco, because much of the color from

23   the tobacco is also removed in the extraction process.

24             So they reapply the nicotine.  Some of that

25   nicotine is lost, because nicotine will dissipate in the

2             So there are methods for recapturing nicotine.

3   Sometimes they will do augmentation of nicotine to add

4   extra nicotine to the tobacco.

5       Q    Okay.  And so we're going to � let's keep

6   rolling here.  I got sidetracked.  Sorry.

7       A    So this is diammonium phosphate, DAP.  This is

8   just showing you some of the additives.  DAP is one of

9   the additives that's added in many of the blends to

10   reconstituted tobacco.  And diammonium phosphate affects

11   the harshness of the smoke, and also changes the pH of

12   the smoke in a way that affects nicotine, which �

13       Q    We're going to get into changes in pH.  I'm

14   sorry, Dr. Cummings.

15       A    Okay.  Sure.  Urea is another pH modifier

16   sometimes used in the design of different blends of

17   cigarettes.

18       Q    Have you seen documents where the cigarette

19   industry, including R.J. Reynolds and companies it's

20   responsible for, specifically discuss why they are

21   changing the pH in cigarettes?

22       A    Yes.

23       Q    Okay.  We'll talk more about that.  And what is

24   this we're looking at now?

25       A    So this is after they have taken up the recon

1   material, and now this is the sheets of tobacco which

2   are running down, and they will eventually chop this up

3   to blend with natural tobacco products � or tobacco

4   blends they use in their cigarettes.

5             1950 is when � in fact Reynolds was the first

6   company to introduce recon tobacco into commercial

7   cigarette.

8       Q    Recon is short for?

9       A    Manmade.

10       Q    Reconstituted?

11       A    Reconstituted tobacco.  You can actually drop

12   it in a glass of water and it will separate.  Recon

13   tobacco will sink to the bottom of the glass of water,

14   the natural tobacco will stay on the surface, and you

15   will see many of the coloring agents come off the recon

16   tobacco.  It changes the color of the water from a clear

17   color to basically an orange/brownish color.

18       Q    Okay.

19       A    You can see this is all automated.  Here is now

20   the chopped up tobacco.  They're blending it together,

21   and they're going to � you know, there are not a lot of

22   people there because it's almost a completely automated

23   process.  They make cigarettes at a rapid rate, you

24   know, thousands and thousands of cigarettes, you know,

25   essentially every minute, and they add the filter plug

1   to it, the paper.

2             There are also additives that are sprayed on

3   the paper to control the burn temperature and the

4   burning rate of the product, which affects the delivery

5   of the nicotine and other chemicals in the smoke.

6       Q    Okay.  So we have talked about documents.  Let

7   me address a couple things, and then we will get into

8   the bulk of your testimony, Dr. Cummings.

9            First of all, these documents that we're going

10   to show the jury today, during the next day and-a-half,

11   approximately a hundred or so, is that � is that a

12   small percentage of the total documents that were �

13   that have now seen the light of day that were formerly

14   secret?                                                                                                               |

15       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

16       Q    Is it possible for us to show anywhere close to |

17   the number?

18       A    No.  I mean, the pictures that I showed you of

19   the document room, which was the basement of Roswell

20   Park, by the way, would be probably five or six of these

21   courtrooms stacked one on top of the other banker boxes

22   floor to ceiling.  That was just the 16 million pages. 2 3       So there's no way to show every document.

24             But using the indexing system, you know, we

25   have looked very carefully for evidence contrary to

2   make it hard to quit because of nicotine addiction.

3       Q    The jury has heard a discussion about whether

4   we cherry picked � were there documents that were

5   cherry picked.

6            How many exhibits did we put on our exhibit

7   list just for this case?

8       A    Just for this case, about 12,000.

9            MR. WALKER:  Objection.  Lack of foundation.

10             THE COURT:  You're going to have to rephrase.

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

12       Q    Have you seen the plaintiff's exhibit list in

13   this case, Dr. Cummings?

14       A    I have.

15       Q    And how many exhibits are just listed on this

16   exhibit list just for this case?

17            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor, as to

18       relevance of what plaintiff's lawyers chose to put

19       on their exhibit list.

20            MR. PRYSOCK:  Your Honor, if I may just briefly

21       respond.

22             THE COURT:  Yes.  In fact, come to sidebar.

23             (Sidebar outside the hearing of the jury.)

24             THE COURT:  I mainly came to sidebar so I could

25       talk to them about the water.  I've been thinking

1       about the water.

2            What's your objection?  You don't want to know

3       how many exhibits they're going to have here?

4            MR. WALKER:  I don't see how it's relevant what |

5       they put on their exhibit list, records and all

6       that.

7             THE COURT:  See, I guess it was because you

8       brought it up in your opening statement.

9            MR. WALKER:  I didn't bring up what they put on f

10       their exhibit list.

11             THE COURT:  No, you �

12            MR. WALKER:  I brought up �

13             THE COURT:  Let me � let me � okay.

14            MR. WALKER:  What I brought up is what they're

15       going to use in his presentation.  I don't mind him

16       asking about that, but what's on their exhibit list

17       has nothing to do with it.

18             THE COURT:  I guess it's anticipatory, but I

19       thought I remembered you in your opening statement 2 0                yesterday say they � I don't know if you used the

21       term cherry pick, or some other word, as to the �

1             You know, it's kind of like I remember watching

2       as a lawyer a judge allowing a jury to see a

3       complaint, and to me that was not very good, because

4       a lot of stuff comes in.  Anyway �

10   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

11       Q    Dr. Cummings, are we going to be able to in a

12   day and-a-half get through all these documents on our

13   list?

14       A    No.

15       Q    How long would it take you sitting here and the

16   jury sitting here listening?

17       A    Based on my experience, it would probably � to

18   go through all of the documents on your list it would

19   probably take ten, twelve weeks.

20       Q    Okay.  Let me ask you something else that's

21   been brought out.

22             First of all, about youth marketing.  Have you

23   done specific studies on youth marketing, which is

24   marketing cigarettes, or aiming them towards kids?

25       A    Yes.  It's an area I studied for many decades,

1   early on studied brand preferences of young people

2   relative to adults, and those were studies I was doing

3   in the late 80's, early 90's.

4       Q    Let me ask you about a couple of those studies.

5            Were they published?  Were your findings

6   published in scientific and medical journals?

7       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

8       Q    Where teenagers get their cigarettes, the

9   survey of purchasing habits of 13- to 16-year olds in 12

10   U.S. communities, was that a study that you conducted?

11       A    Yes, it was.

12       Q    Discrepancies in cigarette brand sales and

13   adult market share, are new teen smokers filling the

14   gap, is that another study you did?

15       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

17        studies, Your Honor?

18            MR. PRYSOCK:  First one was 1992, second one

19       was 1997.                                                                                                  f 2 0            MR. WALKER:  Thank you.

21       Q    Comparison of recent trends and adolescent and

22   adult cigarette smoking behavior and brand preference,

23   1997.  Is that another study you conducted?

24       A    Yes.  Those were studies that were in those

25   twelve communities that I was responsible for in Utica

1   and Binghamton, New York.

2       Q    Are there others that you've done too?

3       A    Yes, many.  In fact, in the late 90's when the

4   internal business records became available one of the

5   grants that I wrote to the National Cancer Institute was

6   to look at their corporate documents to test the

7   question of whether there are statements that they don't

8   market to youth was true or false.

9       Q    Did you look at that � as part of that grant

10   that you received to study that, did you look in a

11   historical context as to whether R.J. Reynolds and the

12   other cigarette makers historically specifically

13   targeted and studied the smoking patterns of kids and

14   teens?                                                                                                                 |

15       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

16       Q    First of all, did they?

17       A    They did target youth, so their claim that they |

18   didn't was false a false claim, and, secondly �

19             THE COURT:  Just answer the question.

2 0       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

21       Q    I would like for you to assume that the jury

22   heard that there is no evidence of youth marketing

23   before the 1970's.

24             Is that accurate, Dr. Cummings? 2 5       A    No.  That would be inaccurate.

	Q
	And are there documents that support that?

2
	A
	Yes.                                             I

3
	Q
	Are there just a couple?

4
	A
	No, there are many.

5
	Q
	Okay.  And let's look � let's look at a few of i;

6
	those now, if we could, sir.
	
7
	
	The first one that I would like you to ask you

8
	about is
	� do you know a document created by Diane

9
	Burrows?
	

10
	A
	Sure .

11
	Q
	Which company did she work for?

12
	A
	R.J. Reynolds.

13
	Q
	Okay.  And Ms. Burrows at R.J. Reynolds � what

14
	year was
	this document that we're looking at here?  I

15
	believe
	it was a retrospective.

16
	A
	Right.  1984.  She was a market analyst for

17
	R.J. Rey
	nolds, and this document was shared at a high

18
	level of
	the company, and it's a look back over 50 years

19
	looking
	at opportunities, and the success of � the rise

20
	and fall
	of different brands in regards to attracting

21
	young pe
	ople.

22
	Q
	Going back 50 years would be � from 1984 would ij

23
	be when,
	Dr. Cummings?

24
	A
	Back into the mid 30's.

25
	Q
	Dr. Cummings, when was John Price born?

2       Q    What year � what year did John Price start

3   smoking cigarettes manufactured by R.J. Reynolds, or one

4   of the other companies?

5       A    Based on what's been represented to me it was

6   sometime in the late 1940's or early 1950's.  Sometime

7   between 1948 and '50.

8       Q    Which would have made him hold?

9       A    Either 12 to 14 years of age.

10       Q    Okay.  So let's pull up PT3400.  And this is a

11   document in evidence.

12            MR. PRYSOCK:  Your Honor, I'm sorry, the

13       plaintiff, at the conclusion of Dr. Cummings'

14       testimony will present all this evidence � or put

15       all this into evidence at once.  I think there's an

16       agreement with defense on that.

17            MR. WALKER:  There is, Your Honor.  There may

18       be some objections along the way, but in terms of

19       procedure I have no objection.

2 0                           THE COURT:  They have not been marked yet with

21       the clerk?

22            MR. PRYSOCK:  Correct.  We are going to just

2 3       submit them all at once.  We will give the clerk an

24        index with all the documents and binders for the

25        jury's review of all the documents.

1             THE COURT:  Thank you.

2            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

3       Q    Okay.  And this was 1984.  We talked about who

4   Diane Burrows was.  And the gentlemen in the listings on

5   the left, who are those people?

6       A    Well, Gerald Long was the president of R.J.

7   Reynolds at the time.  Martin Orlowsky was the head of

8   marketing for R.J. Reynolds at this time in 1984, and

9   Mr. Lees was in charge of new product development at

10   R.J. Reynolds.

11       Q    Younger adult smokers, Strategies and

12   Opportunities is the title of the document.

13            And what is up on the top on this document,

14   Your Honor � sorry � Dr. Cummings?

15       A    Haven't quite got that status.

16             It says secret, and then it's got a number, and

17   strategic research report.

18       Q    Okay.  The title says younger adult smokers.

19   Have you heard that term, YAS for younger adult smokers?

20   Have you seen that in other documents?

21       A    Yes, YAS, younger adult smoker, or FUBYAS,

22   first usual brand young adult smoker.  These were

23   acronyms that were widely used.  In fact, in the paper I

24   wrote on the documents we talk about some of the

25   terminology that's used.

1       Q    And what � it has the word adult in there.

2   Does that just include people over the age of 18 when

3   you see this code or this reference?

4       A    Well, you might think that, but it does not,

5   because when you go to the appendices and you look at

6   the information they're citing, the source of the

7   information on sales and so on, they're utilizing data

8   from the National Family Opinion Poll, which was a study

9   that included 14 and older.  Young people, their market

10   segmentation study, another study that included young

11   people, teens in the study, and they also even cite some

12   government reports and use the term replacement smoker,

13   which describes the fact that almost all teenage � or

14   almost all smoking behavior occurs in that window

15   between the ages of 12 and 24.

16             It's very rare to see somebody take up

17   smoking � and they were talking about the implications

18   in this document for �

19       Q    We'll look at that, Dr. Cummings.  Is this the 2 0       page � Younger Adults Important As Replacement Smokers

21   is the title of this page in this report.  And you used

22   the term there for the first time, replacement smokers.

23            Based upon your review of RJR's internal

24   documents, what is a replacement smoker?  What are they

25   replacing?

1       A    They're replacing the people who quit smoking,

2   adults, and those who die.  They need to replenish the

3   crop of smokers that come in with young people to remain

4   profitable.  And the companies and brands that don't

5   succeed in that regard eventually die off.

6       Q    And if we can look at that page we were talking

7   about, you reference the average of the data, the adult

8   use of tobacco source, and according to this R.J.

9   Reynolds document it references that � it's got age

10   groups, so I want to make sure we're clear.  Start by

11   age.  Start what by age?

12       A    Well, start by � this is regular smoking.  So

13   this is a retrospective study of adult smokers in the

14   United States, a government sponsored survey actually,

15   and these are men, and they're asking them at what age

16   did you start smoking regularly, and you can see age 12

17   it was about 9.9 percent, and then you can go down and

18   you can see, you know, by age 18 you're up to about

19   68.7, or a median regular smoking age of about 2 0        16.7 years among men.

21       Q    You've used the term regular smoker.  Does that

22   mean just sneaking one from mom or dad one time?

23       A    No, they're talking about regular smoking.

24   That's not first smoking experience.  So a lot of

25   people � young people, particularly in this era, would

1   have experimented with smoking, and didn't go on to

2   become a regular smoker.

3             So when they asked the question in the survey

4   it was asking about when did you first become a regular

5   smoker.

6       Q    All right.  So according to this, am I reading

7   this right, that by age 16 almost 43 percent of people

8   that smoked � by age 16, 43 percent of smokers are

9   already smoking?

10       A    Yeah.  I mean, the median is 16.7.  So half are

11   above and half are beyond that age of 16.7.  That's what

12   the median is telling you.

13            And if you look at it, almost all of the

14   smoking � regular smoking behavior has taken place by

15   the age of 24.

16       Q    Okay.  So let's go to another page.  And does

17   the author here, this report sent to the president,

18   discuss the historical context of youth smoking over the

19   last 50 years?                                                                                                j 2 0       A    It does.                                                                                          I

21       Q    Okay.  The importance of � there's that term

22   again, younger adult smokers.  We have already discussed | 2 3       that; right?

2 4       A    That's right.

1   factor in the growth and decline of every major brand

2   and company over the past 50 years.  They will continue

3   to be just as important to brand companies in the future

4   for two simple reasons, the renewal of the market stems

5   almost entirely from 18-year-old smokers.  No more than

6   5 percent of smokers start after age 24.  The brand

7   loyalty of 18-year-old smokers far outweighs any

8   tendency to switch with age.

9            Based upon your review, Dr. Cummings, is that

10   true, that over the last 50 years, from 1934 on, the

11   rise and fall of every major brand was as a direct

12   result of these replacement smokers?

13       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

14       Q    And again this is in 1984.  Looking back

15   50 years to 1934, do you actually � have you seen

16   documents actually where even before 1934 R.J. Reynolds

17   specifically talked about � I'm sorry.  One more part

18   to this report.

19            Younger adult smokers are the only source of

20   replacement smokers.  Less than one-third of smokers,

21   31 percent, start after age 18.  Only 5 percent of

22   smokers start after age 24.  If younger adults turn away |

23   from smoking the industry must decline, just as a

24   population which does not give birth will eventually 2 5       dwindle.

1             Is that a theme, Dr. Cummings, that you've seen |

2   in many documents from the tobacco industry, that if

3   they're unable to capture new smokers from the youth

4   market that their company will not survive?

5       A    Yes.  And this is a historical look back, so

6   they look at some of the popular brands that became the

7   best-selling brands like Pall Mall in the 40's and 50's,

8   that became a top-selling brand, and they do an analysis

9   of who was smoking Pall Mall and how it became a youth

10   brand.

11            We don't think of Pall Mall today that way, but

12   it certainly was regarded that way by Reynolds in the

13   4 0's and 50's.

14            And they do this also for Winston, which became

15   a popular brand for teens in the 50's and 60's, and they |

16   began to dwindle.  Marlboro they talk about.

17             So they actually go to the brands that really

18   picked up.  And it changed over time, which became the

19   in brands for teens.  And that was important, because if | 2 0       you were the in brand your company was well off.  It was

21   important to their sales.  It's part of their business

22   model.  They had to replenish.

23       Q    I got a little sidetracked.  I was asking you

24   about � the jury has heard there were no youth

25   marketing documents before the 70's.  And what � this

1   was a retrospective talking about the prior 50 years.

2             But have you actually seen documents from R.J.

5            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I object to the lead

6       in to the question.  No one said there were no

7       documents.  That statement he keeps making was not

8       made.

9             THE COURT:  Rephrase your question.

10            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

11       Q    Dr. Cummings, are there youth marketing

12   documents from R.J. Reynolds where they discuss

13   targeting high school students prior to the 70's?

14       A    Yes, there are many.  Certainly in the 20's you |

15   see letters to their salespeople about where they would

16   place their brands, particularly in regards to reaching

17   young people in prep schools, high school.

18       Q    We're going to talk about some more later.  I'm |

19   just trying to hit on a couple things I thought the jury |

20   has already heard.  The jury can leave it to their own

21   conclusion.

22             This is 19- � what year?

23       A    This is one from 1927.

24       Q    Again when was John Price born?

25       A    1936.                                                                                                |

1       Q    Okay.  PT4014, which will be in evidence, R.J.

2   Reynolds Tobacco Company, and that is a memo going out

3   to who?

4       A    This is from their sales � regional sales

5   manager to the sales force about getting their products

6   in stores and around where young people would see them.

7   Obviously it's September, early September, so school

8   days are here, and that means big tobacco business for

9   somebody.  Let's get it, and start after it right now,

10   and give every school a good working just as quick as

11   possible after it opens, doing trade building work in

12   accordance with the present and policies.  Line up the

13   leaders and the most popular students.  Get a good

14   distribution on our brands with the nearest dealers, put

15   up pasters, these are posters, put Camel and Prince

16   Albert displays.  In other words, get off to a good

17   start as quick as you can and keep up this work at

18   regular intervals.

19       Q    We're going to have another witness, Dr. Burns,

20   a medical doctor, who will talk in more detail about the

21   developing brain and nicotine.

22             But why � just very briefly, because I don't

23   want to go into all that, but why, according to the

24   tobacco companies, was it important to capture

25   adolescents while they're still developing and expose

1   them to nicotine?

2       A    Well, that's where smoking behavior begins, and

3   if you � you know, it's very rare to see somebody take

4   up smoking after the age of 25.  Brand loyalties are

5   established at that time.

6            And with regards to the biology, nicotine

7   addiction, when the brain gets exposed to an addictive

8   substance like nicotine it alters the brain, the brain

9   is still developing, and the earlier somebody starts

10   smoking, or starts being exposed to nicotine, the more

11   likely we find that they will have a hard time quitting

12   as an adult.  They become heavy smokers, and they tend

13   to be the ones that end up getting sick at the other

14   end.

15       Q    Before we leave this let's look at the next

16   document from around this time, PT4013.  This is a

17   similar document to the salespeople for R.J. Reynolds

18   Tobacco Company?

19       A    Yeah.  Here they're talking about summer

20   school, so this is in June.  You know, regular school is

21   over, summer school is starting.  Most all high schools,

22   prep schools, colleges, universities have finished their

23   spring term and summer schools are now getting underway.

24            Again, the regional sales director here is

25   giving a pep talk to the sales force:  Please get

1   started in this work at once.  Get your men intensely

2   interested in lining up these students for our brands,

3   both as consumers and boosters, and see to it that the

4   stores and stands near the schools have a good supply of

5   our products.

6       Q    Were those plans � have you seen over the

7   years where plans like that were in fact carried out, or

8   was it just discussion about the possibility?

9       A    No, they executed exactly what they talked

10   about.  There was nothing happening by accident.  It was

11   not an accident in this process.  It was carefully

12   researched, engineered in terms of the products and

13   marketing execution to target particular groups,

14   including young people.

15       Q    Let's look at one more document right now on

16   this, and then we're going to come back to more

17   documents on it later.  But one more I want to talk

18   about from the timeframe when John Price was growing up.

19            MR. WALKER:  Objection.  These are not from the

20       timeframe Mr. Price was growing up.  Object to the

21       question.

22             THE COURT:  Two things.  One is that's not what

23        I think he was trying to say, and on the other hand

24       you don't need to say it.  Just ask the question.

25            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir, Your Honor.

1             THE COURT:  Thank you.

2       Q    It will be PT1533 and then PT3570.

3            What was the William Etsy Company?

4       A    They were the advertising firm for R.J.

5   Reynolds Tobacco Company in the 1950's.

6       Q    And what did R.J. Reynolds have them do as part

7   of their � as part of this topic of youth marketing?

8       A    Well, they had their marketing department for

9   Reynolds.  Mr. Suggs had commissioned the Esty firm to

10   do surveys of high school and college students to find

11   out which brands of cigarettes the kids were buying, and

12   the prevalence of smoking.

13             So in '58 and '59 they did a fairly extensive

14   study of high school students, I think about 7500 of

15   them around the country.  This was done in the 50's.

16   They did it again in the 60's.  And we continue to find

17   these studies that they did over the years.

18       Q    And did they provide that information to R.J.

19   Reynolds at RJR's request?

20       A    Yes.  In fact, R.J. Reynolds � Mr. Suggs

21   actually directed them as to the questions they would

22   ask.

23       Q    If we pull up PT3570 � first let's pull up a

24   PT1533, Youth Research Institute, cigarette smoking

25   study on high school and college students.  Preference-

1   wise Camel and Winston are shown as holding their share

2   substantially constant, while Salem increased its share

3   especially among high school students.

4             Dr. Cummings, who makes Camel, Winston and

5   Salem?

6       A    R.J. Reynolds.

7       Q    And which of those brands, if any, do you

8   understand that John Price smoked in this timeframe?

9       A    I understand he smoked Winston cigarettes.

10       Q    And if we can look at the next document from

11   the William Esty Company in 1959, which is PT3570 that

12   will be in evidence, the Youth Research Institute study

13   regarding cigarette smoking among 7521 high school and

14   college students in 80 cities throughout the United

15   States, October through November 1959.

16            High school students total.  And what does it

17   say regarding the number of high school students who

18   were smoking in 1958 and '59, Dr. Cummings?

19       A    Well, in '58 it was 58 percent of high school

20   students reported smoking.  In '59 it was 56 percent.

21   So very high percentage.

22             It was a normal thing for people to smoke, and

23   a higher prevalence among boys than girls at this time.

24   You can see it goes up with age.  The freshmen and

25   sophomore that they surveyed was a little bit lower than

1   junior and senior high, but still very high prevalence.

2   This is the prevalence of smoking among these high

3   school students at that time.

4       Q    And is this people who had just smoked one

5   cigarette, or is this regular smokers?

6       A    These are basically asking do you smoke.  This

7   is very different than the way we ask the question have

8   you puffed on a cigarette once in the last 30 days,

9   which is the way we currently ask the question.  This is

10   asking kids whether they regularly smoke.

11       Q    I would like you to assume, Dr. Cummings, that

12   there will be evidence that by the age of 16 John Price

13   was smoking a pack of Kools a day.  Let me ask �

14            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I object to the

15       improper hypothetical.

16             THE COURT:  I'll have to have a sidebar on that

17       very quickly.

18             (Sidebar outside the hearing of the jury.)

19             THE COURT:  I don't know if that's going to be

20       evidence that's going to come in.

21             Is that evidence that's going to come in?

22            MR. WALKER:  No, Your Honor.  There is no

23       testimony as to when Mr. Price smoked Kool

24        cigarettes.  He said he smoked them, but he was not

25       able � best I recall he was not able to identify

Page 1173 when he smoked Kool cigarettes or any of the

cigarettes that he smoked, and there's no witness

who is going to give that testimony that I'm aware

of.

THE COURT:  That's what's important.

MR. PRYSOCK:  John Price gives the testimony that he was smoking a pack a day at age 16.  He was carrying around a pack, and he had Kool cigarettes.

If they believe that's not accurate �

THE COURT:  Well, give me the � is this the transcript?

MR. PRYSOCK:  I can come back to it, if you want.

THE COURT:  Yeah, because I don't want to spend a ton of time up here.  Y'all can do the research and we'll come back.

MR. PRYSOCK: So I don't run afoul. I'm going to ask, I would like you to assume he was smoking a pack of day at age 16. I won't refer to the brand, but assume a pack a day.

MR. WALKER:  I don't have problem with that.

(Following sidebar.)

THE COURT:  I want to keep things moving so I'm going to have them do some research so I can figure out how to rule later on.

9

strategy.

Project LF is a wider circumference non-menthol

cigarette targeted at younger adult male smokers,

primarily 13- to 24-year-old male Marlboro smokers.

Is that that younger adult smoker term again?

A    Yes.

Q    What do they describe that as?  What age?

A    Well, they're describing it as basically 13 to

24.

Q

Okay.  If we can continue from 1987, and this was a � what was this they were looking to do?

A    Well, they had engineered a product that would have a unique feature, in this case a wider circumference.  They were test marketing this product in different cities to see what the appeal would be in this target audience, which was valued.  So this is what they're describing in terms of their study, and they're looking at an index here of sales of their various different brands, Winston, Camel versus Marlboro in terms of reaching this target audience.

Q    And included in the target audience did they list what regions they were going to target?

A    Yes.

Q    And is Florida listed in those regions?

5   jury has heard in opening that everybody knew cigarettes

6   were harmful back in the 50's.

10       can bring that other thing at the same time.

14       please make certain Mr. Mitnik knows the same

15       thing � don't reference opening statements.  We're

3            MR. PRYSOCK:  I honestly thought it was

4       appropriate, Your Honor.  I understand the court,

5       and I won't do it again, but I need to clear this

6       up, because the jury is left with the misimpression

7       that he doesn't smoke Kools at age 16.

8            MR. WALKER:  I've withdrawn the objection.

9             THE COURT:  Ask the question.

10            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

11             (Following sidebar.)

12       Q    Dr. Cummings, let me go back to something I

13   asked a little bit earlier.

14             I would like for you to assume that John Price

15   was smoking a pack of Kools a day at the age of 16 in

16   1952.                                                                                                                    |

17            Which company makes Kool cigarettes?

18       A    Well, today it's R.J. Reynolds.  At the time it

19   was Brown & Williamson, but Reynolds acquired Brown & 2 0       Williamson.

21       Q    Is R.J. Reynolds responsible for Brown &

2 2       Williamson?

23            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  He's

24       asking him for a legal opinion. 2 5                            THE COURT:  Sustained.

1       Q    Is it a company that R.J. Reynolds took over?

2       A    Yes.

3       Q    Dr. Cummings, I would like to ask you about

4   knowledge in the 50's about harmful effects of

5   cigarettes, and we're going to talk more later about

6   what was happening at the time and the context of

7   things, but let me just ask you this right now.

8             Did the tobacco companies study consumer

9   perception about health risks of smoking over the

10   decades, including the 50's?

11       A    Yes, they did.

12       Q    Was it just a one time or a short thing, or was

13   it extensively done?

14       A    It was extensively done.

15       Q    Okay.  And I would like � and have you

16   reviewed those polls, Dr. Cummings, to get an

17   understanding of what the public knew back in the 50's?

18       A    Yes.  I reviewed the polls done by the tobacco

19   companies, as well as polls that were done by external

20   groups like Gallup, and so on.

21       Q    Okay.  And what is the Roper � the Roper

22   Company?

23       A    It's a major polling firm.  They were hired by

24   a cigarette company in the early 50 's, Philip Morris,

25   and later hired by the Tobacco Institute, which was an

1   organization that came about in 1958, funded by the �

2   all the cigarette manufacturers, and they did regular

3   polling for them for a number of decades.

4        Q    Okay.  And if we could pull up a poll.  This

5   will be PT4884 when it goes into evidence.  This is

6   September 1953.  And how old would John Price have been

7   in 1953?

8       A    Well, he was born in '36, so he would have

9   been, what, 14, 15, years old, something like that.

10        Q    How about 17?

11       A    17.

12        Q    Sorry I put you on the spot.

13       A    You did.

14        Q    All right.  So you've reviewed this poll,

15   haven't you?

16       A    I have.  It's a huge document.  It's just a

17   summary.  There are memos that relate to this as well,

18   but I have reviewed it.

19       Q    Okay.  Was this just a snap poll of a small

20   number of people?

21       A    No, this was a massive poll.  Over 10,000

22   households were surveyed.  They interviewed people in

23   those households and assessed smoking habits.  I think

24   58 percent of men were smoking, 36 percent of women,

25   47 percent overall.  And they asked a variety of

1   questions in 1953 about issues related to smoking and

2   health.  This is sort of the pre-survey for the

3   introduction of Marlboro cigarettes.

4       Q    Okay.  What harm, if any, do you think

5   cigarette smoking does you either mentally, physically,

6   or emotionally?

7             Have you seen this poll result?

8       A    Yes.  This is asked of the smokers, so the

9   47 percent who had indicated they were smokers, and it

10   was an open-ended question, and they asked people to

11   indicate what the health problems were.  I think the

12   most common response were none, but they asked about

13   other things as well that people gave in this open-ended

14   question.

15       Q    What percentage, Dr. Cummings, responded � in

16   1953 responded that they believed cigarette smoking may

17   cause cancer, cause cancer of the lips or lungs?

18       A    1 percent.

19       Q    What percentage of people thought that

20   cigarettes caused no harm whatsoever?

21       A    Well, in 1953 it was 40 percent.

22       Q    And we can look at some of the other harms:

23   Stained teeth, fingers, makes you dizzy, bad for teeth.

24   There are small percentages of those too; correct?

25       A    Yeah.  Throat irritation, get your wind.  Those

1   were the harms that people were talking about.  So when

2   you � there were polls done at this time asking whether f

3   there's any harm from smoking, you find that about

4   60 percent would say yes, but the harms were not cancer

5   or, you know, other serious illnesses.  They were really

6   minor things like throat irritation, get your wind, make

7   you dizzy, bad breath.

8       Q    When you hear a poll that says can cigarettes

9   � are cigarettes harmful, do you have to understand

10   what the public actually meant when they were saying

11   harmful?

12       A    Sure.  And some of the polls � for example,

13   the Gallup poll in '54 that asked that question did ask

14   the followup as to what the harms were.  I think in

15    '54 � so a year later � I think cancer was mentioned

16   by about 6 percent.

17             So it had gone up obviously from the Roper

18   period, but mostly it was the things that I mentioned,

19   you know, irritating to the throat, bad breath,

20   lightheaded, takes your wind.

21       Q    Let's look at one more if we can, PT3295A.

22   This is a little bit later on in time.

23            Who was this poll � who was this survey done

2 4        for?                                                                                                                             |

1   they repeated the poll that they had done in '53.  This

2   is a number of years later.  They asked similar

3   questions about smoking prevalence and the brands people

4   are smoking, and then again around the health causes, or |

5   health risks of smoking.

6       Q    Okay.  The trouble with cigarettes is that

7   they...

8            And then was the poll taken as to what somebody |

9   said they believed the trouble with cigarettes was?

10       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

11       Q    Physically harmful, 22 percent.

12            And then is there a breakdown of what people

13   meant by physically harmful?

14       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

15       Q    Okay.  Harmful to your lungs, wind, breathing,

16   could cause cancer.

17            What percentage of people in 1959 believed that

18   cigarette smoking was harmful to your lungs, wind,

19   breathing, or could cause cancer?

20       A    Well, you have 3 percent cause.  Or could cause

21   cancer I think is just 1 percent.

22       Q    Okay.  And another part of this poll:  Assuming |

23   a person does all of the following things, which one of

24   these activities do you think is most dangerous to life

25   of the things listed.

1   perception studies and beliefs, and how beliefs relate

2   to behavior, having heard something is, you know, really

3   just awareness of the topic.

4             That's not a belief.  That's just whether you

5   have heard something, read it in the news or seen it on

6   television, or whatever.  And I think regarding heard

7   smoking is � you know, is a health issue, I think most

8   people had heard of that in the 50's.

9            But believing that it caused something like

10   cancer is very different.  Then believing that it will

11   personally affect you is even really a further belief.

12   It's much lower.  And, of course, it's the personalized

13   belief that it's actually affecting your health that is

14   important in terms of changing behavior.

15       Q    Have you seen other examples and polls of this

16   big difference between having heard and believing

17   something?

18       A    Sure.  If you see the Gallup poll, I think in

19    '54 they asked about, you know, have you heard about

20   smoking as a cause of health problems.  I think that was

21   heard or read, I think it the way they worded it.

22   That's a very high percentage, around 90 percent.

23            But when you � actually in that same poll they

24   ask, do you believe cigarette smoking is one of the

25   causes of � not even the cause, but just one of the

1   causes of somebody getting lung cancer, and in that poll

2   if you look at pack-a-day smokers it was, I think,

3   29 percent.

4       Q    Have you seen other examples of heard versus

5   believe, is there another example of that as far as, you

6   know, in real life, you know, versus what people

7   actually believe?

8       A    Sure.  I mean, there are many examples.  I

9   think today global warming, for example.  People have

10   heard that topic.  Some people believe it, some people

11   don't believe it, and some people believe it's actually

12   affecting them and it's changing their behavior.  Maybe

13   they're going to move where they live, and so on.

14             So there's � UFO's is another example I think

15   people have used.  We have all heard stories about

16   UFO's.  So awareness of that would be very high.

17   Whether people believe it, that would be very low.

18             So in the 50's and 60's, I mean, the belief

19   about smoking as a real risk was very low, although

20   people, you know, were getting exposed to the

21   information environment, which was accelerating on the

22   issue of smoking and health at that time.

23       Q    Okay.  The next thing I would like to address

1            What is your understanding of the brands that

10       Q    Do you have an understanding of the brands Mr.

12       A    Yes, it was represented to me �

13             THE COURT:  Wait, wait.  What's the source?

14       Q    What is the source of this information?

17       heard on this?  I object to that.

22   hypothetically that John Price smoked the following

23   brands, Pall Malls � strike that � that he smoked

24   Kools, then Pall Malls, then Winstons.

1   those specific brands that follows trends of other

2   smokers in the United States from the 50's forward?

3            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  Improper

4       hypothetical.

5             THE COURT:  Overruled.

6       A    Yes.  I mean, there's substantial documentation

7   within the business records of the companies tracking

8   the leading brands of cigarettes, and in the 40's and

9   50's Pall Mall was a top-selling brand particularly

10   among young people.  Then Winston became the top-

11   selling cigarette in the U.S. in the late 50's and early

12   60 ' s, and actually into the 70's.

13       Q    And are there documents that discuss the

14   success of these brands as it ties to marketing?

15       A    Yes.  I mean, the Burrows documents that we saw

16   previously on attracting young people to smoke their

17   brands talks about the history of Pall Mall and Winston.

18   I think they may even mention Kool as well.  And there

19   are other documents as well that talk about the success

20   of these brands.

21             They were among the most heavily advertised and

22   successful brands in America.

23       Q    If we could look, this is back at PT3400.  This

24   section traces every brand which has risen to a 10

25   percent or higher share among 18-year-old smokers since

1   the 1930's.  There have only been six, but they include

2   the major brands of the last half century:  Pall Mall,

3   Winston, Marlboro, Kool, Salem and Newport.

4             So since the 30's were those the most

5   successful brands?

6       A    Yes, they were.

7       Q    Who manufactured or now is responsible for Pall

8   Malls, Kools and Marlboro � I'm sorry, strike that �

9   Pall Malls, Kools and Winstons?

10       A    Well, Winston actually I think was sold off

11   recently when they acquired Lorillard, as was Salem, but

12   during the time period that Mr. Price smoked it was R.J.

13   Reynolds and Brown & Williamson, which was acquired by

14   Reynolds.

15       Q    And what is significant about Winstons as far

16   as the timing of when Winstons came out?  First of all,

17   when did Winstons come out?

18       A    Winstons were introduced in March 1954.

19       Q    Okay.  And if � if Mr. Price switched to

20   Winstons around that timeframe in the late 50's, was

21   there a trend among Americans toward � away from that

22   � away from other cigarettes towards Winstons?

23            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  There's

24       no basis for that hypothetical.

25             THE COURT:  Restate it, please.

1       Q    What was the trend going on at the time in the

2   mid to late 50's as far as smokers and a switch from

3   certain types of cigarettes to other types of

4   cigarettes?

5       A    There was the transition from unfiltered to

6   filtered cigarettes.  So if you look at the data on the

7   percentage of the smoking population that smoked an

8   unfiltered cigarettes in the early 50's it was less than

9   2 percent.  That number was about 60 percent to the

10   filter market by the end of the 1950's.  So a huge

11   transition.

12            Winston was introduced as a filtered cigarette.

13   Marlboro remained as a filtered cigarette, also

14   introduced in 1954.  Kool early on was a nonfiltered

15   cigarette.  I believe it was in 1956 that they added a

16   filter to it.

17       Q    Does Winston make an unfiltered cigarette?

18       A    No.

19       Q    So if Mr. Price smoked Winston cigarettes,

20   would every one that he smoked have had a filter on it?

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    We're going to talk more about it later, but

23   just so we're clear.  Dr. Cummings, are filters any

24   safer than other cigarettes? 2 5       A    No.

1       Q    Are there internal documents where the tobacco

2   companies specifically discuss their knowledge that

3   filters weren't any safer?

4       A    Yes, they talk about it as an illusion.

5            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  The

6       question is ambiguous.  He's asking about tobacco

7        companies.

8             THE COURT:  Overruled.

9       Q    Go ahead, Doctor.

10       A    Yeah.  There's documents that talk about the

11   illusion of filtration.  More important than the fact of

12   filtration there are documents that talk about people

13   who went to filters did so with the belief that they

14   were getting less tar and nicotine, when in fact they

15   weren't.  In fact, in some cases they were getting more

16   tar and nicotine.

17       Q    Let me ask you.  Were filters portrayed as

18   being safer cigarettes?

19            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.

20             I'll withdraw the objection.

21       Q    How were filters portrayed?

22       A    Well, for Winston, for example, they talked

23   about it as their pure white filter, a new filter blend.

24   That was the marketing theme for Winston, and it became

25   the top-selling filtered cigarette in American.

1       Q    Dr. Cummings, have you done studies on consumer

2   expectations and understanding as to specific types of

3   cigarettes?

4       A    Yes.  Filters and non-filters specifically.

5   I've published several papers on that topic.

6       Q    To this day what do most smokers believe, and

7   non-smokers, about filtered cigarettes?

9       relevance of what smokers believe today about filter

10       cigarettes.

16            MR. WALKER:  I think it's irrelevant.  What

17       does it matter what people today think about filter

18       cigarettes?

19            MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, even today people still

22            MR. PRYSOCK:  It goes back to when he was

23       smoking them, that even today, with everything we

13   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

14       Q    Dr. Cummings, what do most smokers believe

15   still today about filters?

16       A    Believe that they are safer than a non-filter

17   cigarette.

18       Q    And going back to this document, PT3400:

19   Winston, the hit of the 1950's and 60's.  External

20   influences in the 1950's contributed to the Winston

21   opportunity.

22             Then we go on talking about all the modern

23   cigarette, and it discusses market importance in the

24   early 50's.

25            Rush Winston to market in March 1954 near the

1   crest of the health scare.  Winston was introduced on

2   TV, a fad that spread from 9 percent of all households

3   in 1950 to 87 percent by 1960.  Advertising dollars were

4   a key advantage for Winston over its filter competitors,

5   and the bulk of those dollars were used to leverage TV.

6   Younger adults and older smokers alike responded

7   promptly to Winston's positive proposition, Winston

8   tastes good.  Its point of difference from other filter

9   brands in the product efficiency non-filter smokers

10   might expect.

11             Dr. Cummings, was that, based on your review,

12   the trend also, people switching to Winston cigarettes?

13       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

14       Q    Let's look at one more, PT3872 as it regards

15   brands.  Copy study of cigarette advertising made by

16   J.W. Burgard, 1953.  And what is the Bates & Company?

17       A    They were the marketing and advertising company f

18   for Brown & Williamson, and they had produced a study to |

19   look at detail of the success of cigarette brands really |

20   from the early 20's up to 1953, their advertising themes

21   that they used, and the advertising dollars and how they |

22   were expended, so they could make conclusions about the

23   impact of advertising on consumer behavior.

24       Q    Okay.  And if we can look at PT3872.  The

25   cigarette industry dramatically demonstrates the force

1   of advertising in the United States.  We have millions

2   of individual purchases every day of the year, and every

3   consumer is presold, specifying his brand by name.  The

4   rise and fall of every brand of consequence has been

5   traced in detail, and their year to year success or

6   failure shown to be the direct result of consumer

7   advertising.

8             Dr. Cummings, is that � first of all, did I

9   read that correctly?

10       A    You did.

11       Q    Is that an accurate statement based upon your

12   study of the trends of cigarette smokers in the U.S.

13   over the last 50 years, as far as brands that they

14   chose?

15       A    Yes, it's an accurate statement certainly up to

16   1953, and you find other internal business records � I

17   think we saw the Burrows document talking about young

18   people taking up specific brands, but there are other

19   documents from all the companies that basically talk

20   about the success of their advertising being critical to

21   their sales, and that consumers relied on their

22   advertising to make their brand choices.  They weren't 2 3        random.

24       Q    And this last part:  The rise and fall of every

25   brand of consequence has been traced in detail and their

1   year-to-year success or failure shown to be the direct

2   result of consumer advertising, let me ask you, Dr.

3   Cummings, have you studied that too, why consumers say

4   they smoke a certain brand?

5       A    Yes, it's been a major part of the research not

6   only on why people smoke, but why they smoke what they

7   do smoke.

8       Q    Would it surprise you if somebody didn't say, I

9   smoked this brand specifically because I saw these ads?

10       A    No, that would not surprise me at all.  Most

11   consumers, with regards to almost any consumer purchase

12   they make, aren't linking it directly to an

13   advertisement unless it has to do with it's available

14   because it's cheaper.  You know, people will say, well,

15   I bought this product because it was less expensive.

16            But with regard to cigarette marketing, which

17   was mostly a lifestyle type of marketing, you know,

18   people didn't understand how their behavior was being

19   influenced.  It was really the mass of advertising.  As

20   they describe here, it was the amount of advertising,

21   actual dollars expended for particular brands that made

22   them successful, and how they targeted particular

23   consumer groups for particular groups.  There were two

24   main groups.  There was young people and there were the

25   health-concerned smokers.

1       Q    So despite somebody may not specifically say I

2   smoked because of that advertisement, do the trends and

3   the facts bear out that consumers smoke because of the

4   amount of advertising on a specific brand that a company

5   does?

6       A    Yes.

7       Q    And again, what were the three most heavily

8   advertised brands in the history of cigarettes over the

9   last century?

10       A    Marlboro, you know, Winston, and, you know,

11   probably Newport at this point.

12       Q    Over the last 50 years how about Pall Mall and

13   Kools?

14       A    Well, Pall Mall and Kool were heavily marketed

15   brands.  The industry itself between 1940 and 2005 spent

16   250 billion dollars in advertising.  It's the most

17   heavily advertised consumer product on the market, and

18   most every company had their flagship brands, and they

19   put their money behind their brand.

20       Q    What was that number again over the years?  Say

21   that again.

22       A    250 billion dollars expended between 1940 and

23   2005.  That's just advertising dollars.  That's paid

24   advertising dollars.  It doesn't include the research

25   and development to create that advertising, the

1   marketing studies they did behind the advertising.  That

2   was � that would be even additional resources.

3       Q    In the history of the world has there ever been

4   a consumer product during that timeframe that was

5   advertised as heavily as cigarettes?

6       A    Not that I'm aware of.  I mean, certainly in

7   the United States where we've looked at the advertising

8   expenditures year to year � this is one of the things

9   that became available once the internal business records

10   were available � cigarettes were clearly the most

11   heavily advertised consumer product.  More than cars,

12   more than certain food products or detergents.

13             So they were major players controlling

14   newspapers, magazines, billboards, television, radio,

15   dominating every part of the media.  So it was

16   inescapable for people.

17       Q    Let's put up quickly � are you familiar with

18   FTC reports, Dr. Cummings?

19       A    I am.

20       Q    FTC stands for what?

21       A    Federal Trade Commission.

22       Q    All right.  And are you familiar with the 1967

23   FTC report?

24       A    Yes.  Congress basically asked the FTC � gave

25   them regulatory authority and asked them to produce a

1   report on cigarette advertising, and also later testing

2   tar and nicotine values of cigarettes.

3             The first of those reports was 1967, and they

4   have continued ever since.

5       Q    Okay.  And if we can look at PT3870 briefly.

6   This was a report to congress; is that right?

7       A    This is the first one from the FTC.  I mean,

8   FTC did other things before this, but they had

9   regulatory authority beginning in the mid 60's, and this

10   was the first of their mandated reports that they put

11   out on cigarette advertising.

12       Q    Cigarette advertising reaches virtually all

13   Americans who can either read or understand the spoken

14   word.  So pervasive is cigarette advertising that it is

15   virtually impossible for Americans of almost any age to

16   avoid cigarette advertising.

17             Is that your understanding too of what was

18   going on at the time, based upon their internal

19   documents too?

20       A    Yes.  I mean, this is an accurate

21   characterization of what was going on at the time.  I

22   mean, they particularly focus in this report on TV

23   advertising, which in the 50's and 60's had become one

24   of the main ways that the companies communicated to

25   consumers about their brands.

1            And they talk about consumer choices of

2   filtered brands in particular, which had become the

3   dominant type of cigarettes smoked by the mid 60's, and

4   the massive amount of advertising.

5             There were only three channels.  There were

6   over 80 TV shows sponsored by cigarette companies on

7   those three channels, you know, anywhere from popular

8   comedies of the day to Saturday night at the movies, NFL |

9   football.  You could hardly � you could hardly avoid

10   it.

11            And they talk about the exposures that

12   different age groups got, particularly kids they were

13   concerned about at this time.

14       Q    At the time when this is done, in talking about

15   the pervasiveness of cigarette advertising, John Price

16   would have been an adult having smoked for � well,

17   however many years, but he would have been a 40-year-old |

18   adult at that time?

19       A    Correct.                                                                                          |

20       Q    Exposed to all this information from the

21   cigarette companies?  Strike that.

22            Would he have been exposed to the advertising 2 3       they're talking about?

1             THE COURT:  Overruled.

2       A    Yes, he was obviously exposed, because he was

3   making brand choices, smoking the most heavily

4   advertised brand in America, Winston.

5       Q    One more thing I want to hit on at the start

6   here.

7             Have you heard a reference before to the

8   Surgeon General of the United States calling smoking a

9   personal choice behavior?

10       A    I've seen that cherry picked out of Surgeon

11   General reports.  So you can find reference that.

12   That's not what the Surgeon General describes it today.

13       Q    And if that phrase was used in a report �

14   first of all, when was that around the timeframe the

15   Surgeon General � that that reference was used in a

16   Surgeon General report?

17       A    I've seen it in 1982, I think in regards to �

18   I think the comment personal choice behavior was you

19   couldn't randomize people to be smokers or non-smokers,

20   so you could then see what would happen 50 years down

21   the line in terms of diseases that people got, because

22   you can't randomize people to personal choice behaviors.

23             That was the context of that statement in 1982.

24       Q    Okay.  And in 1982 had the Surgeon General yet

25   done an entire � an entire Surgeon General report on

1
	nicotine addiction yet?

2
	A    No.  The first report on why people smoke was

3
	1988.

4
	Q    Is this a copy of that report?

5
	A    It is.

6
	Q    So this was after that reference to personal

7
	choice behavior?

8
	A    Correct.

9
	Q    This entire report, is this devoted -- every

10
	Surgeon General's office spent � and all the reviewers

11
	and contributors spent the entire report looking at

12
	nicotine addiction; is that right?

13
	MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I've not objected to

14
	every leading question, but that one is leading.

15
	MR. PRYSOCK:  I'll rephrase.

16
	Q    What was the purpose of this entire report and ;

17
	all the scientists and researchers that went into

18
	studying this report?

19
	A    To understand why people smoke.

20
	Q    So after this report is done in 1988 did the

21
	Surgeon General address this topic of personal choice

22
	behavior?

23
	A    Yes.                                           i

24
	Q    Let's see, if we can, what the Surgeon General

25
	said after it looked at nicotine addiction.  PT3289.

1   Two additional factors make smoking among young people a

2   preeminent public concern, the age of initiation of

3   smoking and nicotine addiction.  These two factors

4   refute the argument that smoking is a matter of free

5   choice.

6            Dr. Cummings, what is it about the age of

7   initiation, again just briefly you touched on it, but as

8   we harken back to that?

9       A    Well, most people are starting their smoking

10   during their teenage years.  They're not concerned about

11   long-term health consequences, or even smoking a week

12   later.  So they're not very informed, and not paying

13   attention really to the health consequences.

14            When you're a teenage you're worried about your

15   date on the weekend, rather than whether you're going to

16   be an addicted smoker.

17            And then once you get started smoking and

18   expose the developing brain to nicotine it's easy to get

19   hooked, and about a third of those who experiment do get

20   hooked and become the long-term smokers.  Then they

21   continue to smoke day in and day out because of nicotine

22   addiction.

23            Nobody chooses to get sick as a result of

24   smoking.  They keep smoking because of their addiction.

25       Q    Dr. Cummings, have you seen public statements

1   by the tobacco companies, including R.J. Reynolds, as

2   part of the conspiracy and fraud that we're going to be

3   talking about where they discuss personal choice

4   behaviors, smokers?

5            MR. WALKER:  Objection argumentative as framed,

6       Your Honor.

7             THE COURT:  Yeah, you're going to have to

8       rephrase it, but in addition to that I think it's

9       time to take a break.

10            MR. PRYSOCK:  I'm about to move on to another

11       topic.  I understand, Your Honor.  Just a couple

12       more questions.

13       Q    Dr. Cummings, is that a refrain that you have

14   heard publicly?

15             THE COURT:  Rephrase your question.

16            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

17       Q    Sir, what does personal choice behavior have to |

18   do with public statements by the tobacco industry?

19       A    The companies would tell people that it was a

20   free choice to smoke, and they would try to defend the

21   person's right to smoke while denying that their

22   products were addictive.

23       Q    Have you seen internal documents that discuss a |

24   different aspect of whether it's personal choice

25   behavior or addiction?

1       A    Yes, I have.

2       Q    If we could pull up PT2184.  First of all, this

3   is a document � who is Mr. Kloepfer and Mr. Knopick?

4       A    Mr. Kloepfer was vice president, second in

5   command at the Tobacco Institute in charge of their

6   public issues.  Mr. Knopick was the editor of a

7   publication, The Tobacco Observer, that the Tobacco

8   Institute put out, and they would basically try to track

9   stuff in the public domain, you know, the medical area,

10   science, and then report it out with their spin on it.

11            And here he is commenting on some statements

12   that have come out of the National Institutes on Drug

13   Abuse where the commissioner in 1980 had suggested that

14   cigarette smoking was a drug addiction due to nicotine,

15   and then he comments at the end of this on what the

16   lawyers had reminded him.

17       Q    And let me ask you.  Tobacco Institute.  We

18   have heard that � that's the first time we have heard

19   that term.  We're going to talk more about it, but just

20   briefly, was that the PR arm of the cigarette companies,

21   including R.J. Reynolds?

22       A    Yes, the Tobacco Institute was incorporated in

23   1958, and they essentially served as the spokespeople

24   for tobacco manufacturers, including R.J. Reynolds, on

25   issues related to smoking and health.  That was one of

1   their primary missions, and they did that from 1958

2   until they went out of business in 1998.

3       Q    Was this a formerly secret document, one of the

4   documents that was turned over much later?

5       A    Yes, this is one of the documents we got out of

6   the Tobacco Institute archive that got turned over to me

7   at Roswell Park.

8       Q    And if we can look at it now.

9            Attached please find the technical review of

10   the conference which led to Victor Cohn's surprise story

11   of 8/30 that the National Institute of Drug Abuse wants

12   addictive added to the cigarette warning.  In L188 we

13   quoted Pollins' predecessor, cigarette smoking is more

14   addictive than using heroin, hooking two-thirds of the

15   people who ever smoke.

16             The lawyers remind us, I'm told �

17            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I'm sorry.  I object

18       to this being displayed in this way.

19             THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm going to go ahead and

20       take a break now, and then I'll handle this while

21       we're taking a break.

22             It is 33 minutes after 10.  Please be back at

23       five minutes 'til 11.  In the meantime, remember

24       don't discuss this case with anyone, not even among

25       yourselves.  Thank you very much.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. WALKER:  They have altered the document in a way that I didn't request.

THE COURT:  What do you mean by alter?

MR. WALKER: It was redacted to say the lawyers in a very generic way. That's not what the document says. Somebody whited out what it actually says and typed in the lawyers over top of it.

Mr. Prysock asked me �

THE COURT:  That's fine, and I appreciate it, if we have changed the exhibit from what?

MR. WALKER:  There's a reason that sometimes that document is redacted, but Mr. Prysock asked me before he began his presentation whether I wanted the redaction that is sometimes made, and I said no. He said okay.

So I was surprised to see it come up in that fashion, because we had discussed it.

THE COURT:  Do we have an unredacted copy?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir, Your Honor, but here is the problem.  There is an all-cases order that they asked for be entered in this case that says law firm names be redacted.  They asked for that, Your Honor, pretrial.  We redacted it.

1            And, you know, to say, oh, I was surprised to

2        see that, that's how it's done in almost every

3       single case, including our exhibit.  When we gave it

4       to them it was the redacted version.

5             Here is the problem now, Your Honor.  If we

6       take it out now it's going to look like I was doing

7       that.

8             THE COURT:  Do you think the jury remembers

9       what you just had up on the wall?

10            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, yes, I think they do,

11       because he stood up and objected and highlighted it.

12            MR. WALKER:  I didn't highlight the phrase.  I

13        just said in the way it's being shown.

14             THE COURT:  I don't think so, and I'm paying

15       attention.  I'm reading as we go along.  I'm reading |

16       and listening and trying to do it all at one time.

17             Do you have the unredacted copy?

18            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

19             THE COURT:  If there has not been an agreement,

20       a stipulation as to that particular document in the

21       redacted form, then in that event I am happy for the

22       document to go in in an unredacted form.

23            MR. PRYSOCK:  But there has been an agreement,

24       because they asked for the all-cases order.  I'm

25       following the all-cases order that specifically

THE COURT:  Are there any other documents that you're concerned about, by the way?

MR. WALKER:  I don't think so.  Mr. Prysock asked me if I wanted the references to Shook Hardy in or out.  I said in.  I thought he was talking about this document.

If there's some other document he was asking me about, I don't know what it would be.

MR. PRYSOCK:  I was asking about another document, Your Honor.  It was one we discussed.

THE COURT:  Do you have this document unredacted?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.  I'll be happy to do other documents if they're now withdrawing �

THE COURT:  I'm not going to go through everything.  I'm just going to go on this particular document.

Let me just tell you something.  I've been doing this about 15 years, and I find when I start trying to do things beyond what's going on right here it gets really scrambled.

So if you have that document, while we're taking a break reload that document, and then just do what you were going to do with the document

	BY MR. PRYSOCK:

9
	Q     Ready, Dr. Cummings?

10
	A     Yes, I am.

11
	Q     Okay.  Doctor, let's go back to � we were talking ij

12
	about PT2184, and we were talking about the concept of

13
	addiction versus free choice.  And, again, just for

14
	orientation, this was a document that's formerly a secret

15
	document by � from who?

16
	A     This is Mr. Knopick to his boss, essentially

17
	William Kloepfer, who is second in charge of The Tobacco

18
	Institute.

19
	Q     And The Tobacco Institute was speaking on behalf

20
	of who?                                                      I

21
	A    Well, the defendant in this case as well as other

22
	cigarette manufacturers.  That's what funded The Tobacco

23
	Institute.

24
	Q     Okay.  And that was -- the manufacturers all split ji

	A
	It was based on cigarette sales.                  \

9
	
	MR. PRYSOCK:  All right.  Now, let's highlight it. \

10
	Q
	"Shook Hardy reminds us, I'm told, that the entire \

11
	matter
	of addiction is the post potent weapon a prosecuting

12
	attorney can have in a lung cancer cigarette case.  We can't i;
	
13
	defend
	continued smoking as free choice if the person was

14
	addicted."
	
15
	
	Dr. Cummings, first of all, did I read that

16
	right?
	

17
	A
	You did.

18
	Q
	And was this a formerly � this was a document     I

19
	that not was available to the public until it became
	
20
	available in 2000?
	
21
	A
	Yes.  I discovered it, you know, basically after

22
	we got
	The Tobacco Institute materials and then we're

23
	going -
	� digitizing it and that's when it was found.

1   time?

2       A     No.  Publicly, the cigarette companies denied;

3   Reynolds denied that cigarette smoking was addictive.

4       Q     And going back to what we were talking about, the

5   Surgeon General, based upon the study of nicotine addiction

6   in 1988, how it refutes the matter of free choice, is this

7   internal document from the tobacco industry consistent with

8   what the Surgeon General takes the position as far as

9   nicotine addiction?

10       A     Yes.  This document is consistent with what the

11   Surgeon General was saying eight years later, and this

12   internal business record is consistent with other internal

13   business records going back decades, where they talk about

14   their cigarettes being an addiction.

15       Q     And there's a reference to � it says "Shook Hardy

16   reminds us."  What is Shook Hardy?

17       A     Shook Hardy was the law firm that � you know, was

18   the legal counsel hired by the cigarette companies,

19   including R. J. Reynolds, for the � what they refer to as

20   the Council For Tobacco Research, which previously before

21   that -- before 1964 was called the "Tobacco Industry

22   Research Committee."  So they were the lawyers, outside

23   counsel, for the cigarette companies.

24       Q     And we'll come back to Shook Hardy later.

25       A     Sure.

1       Q     Okay.  Let me ask you:  Dr. Cummings, so I think

2   you mentioned it, but publicly, what has been the public

3   position � first of all, when did R. J. Reynolds admit

4   publicly that cigarette smoking is addictive?

5       A     It was after 2000, sometime in the early part of

6   two thousand � around 2004, I believe, when they were asked

7   if they had stipulations at the Department of Justice.

8       Q     Prior to that time, had R. J. Reynolds and the

9   other companies taken a very strong position as to whether

10   cigarettes are addictive?

11       A     Yes.  When they were asked, they said their

12   products were not addictive, and I found documentation of

13   that into the '70s, when they -- the consumers would write

14   down public testimony to Congress in the early 1980s and, of

15   course, testimony in the mid '90s, when the CEOs of the

16   cigarette companies testified in front of Congressman

17   Waxman's committee.

18       Q     Okay.  We've hit on a few highlights early on,

19   Dr. Cummings.  Now I'd like to go into some of the more

20   details of what you're going to discuss here today.

21             And what have we asked you to discuss in terms of

22   how things relate to John Price and the actions of the

23   cigarette industry?  Why have we brought you here today?

24       A     Well, I -- I was brought here to basically provide

25   a historical context to understand the actions of cigarette

1   companies during the time that John Price grew up and became

2   a smoker and continued to smoke until he � until he was

3   diagnosed and eventually died of COPD.

4       Q     In addition to how things relate to John Price,

5   Dr. Cummings, I'd like for you to assume that the plaintiff

6   in this case has the burden to prove reprehensibility of

7   conduct, are you prepared � on the part of the cigarette

8   companies.  Are you prepared to discuss the evidence that

9   you see in your review of the documents regarding their

10   conduct?

11             MR. WALKER:  Objection to the preamble to the

12       guestion, Your Honor.

13             THE COURT:  Okay.  Overruled.

14       A     Yes, I am.

15       Q     Okay.  We've -- we've talked about addiction

16   somewhat or a little bit, and we've looked at a couple of

17   documents.  But let me ask you, Dr. Cummings, just

18   briefly � and we've talked some about nicotine, but what is

19   it that makes cigarettes addictive, just as far as in terms

20   of the smoker and smoking behavior?

21       A     Well, the key ingredient is the nicotine.  It's

22   the addictive part of cigarettes and the ability to deliver

23   that nicotine in an efficient, rapid way so it affects the

24   brain.  So the relation to smoke is key because these � you

25   know, the lungs are a huge surface area, facilitates a rapid

1   absorption of nicotine.  So when you take a puff on a

2   cigarette, the nicotine is literally hitting in your brain

3   within about seven to ten seconds after the puff on a

4   cigarette.

5             A nicotine patch, not very addictive.  You put it

6   on.  It will give you nicotine, but it's slowly absorbed

7   through the lining of the skin in a controlled release and,

8   you know, takes about two hours to get the nicotine levels

9   up to sort of a steady state level with the nicotine patch.

10   Not very addictive.

11             So the key is inhalation and delivery of nicotine.

12       Q     In addition to nicotine, are there other things

13   about cigarettes that make them addictive?

14       A     Sure.  Some of the additives in the product and

15   the way the product is engineered, you know, mainly

16   influence inhalation and also form of nicotine.  Nicotine is

17   slightly acidic.  When you burn tobacco, it's slightly

18   acidic smoke, and by altering slightly the pH of the smoke

19   to make it more basic changes the form from bound nicotine

20   to its unbound form they refer to as "free nicotine."  And

21   that can give, you know, the person greater absorption of

22   nicotine in their bloodstream.

23       Q     And we saw that video earlier.

24             MR. WALKER:  I object to that answer on -- based

25       on Your Honor's pretrial ruling and would reguest �

5   of the jury as follows:)

6             THE COURT:  Go ahead.

7             MR. WALKER:  We discussed this before we began,

8       Your Honor.  The ruling is that Dr. Cummings is not

9       permitted to testify that any particular design of

10       cigarettes makes them more addictive.  The guestion that

11       Mr. Prysock asked specifically was whether there was

12       something about cigarettes that makes them more

13       addictive.  That was the guestion he asked.  And in

14       answer to that guestion, Dr. Cummings described a

15       particular design feature of cigarettes in answer to the

16       guestion of whether something makes them more addictive.

17       That is a violation of our �

23             THE COURT:  Okay.  I apologize.  I'm sorry.  I'm

bloodstream.

MR. WALKER:  That's the Q and A, Your Honor.  The question he specifically asked was about making cigarettes addictive and right at the end of his question and the answer is describing a design feature of cigarettes.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I � you know, I appreciate it. But I -- he did not identify a particular design, given this particular causation to addictiveness.

MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, he's describing � he's describing -- he's describing additives, Your Honor.  That � that's also separately set forth in the order about additives.  He's talking about altering the pH.

THE COURT:  I'm scrolling down.

I understand.  And it's my impression that he would be talking about these things generally but not taking a position that one � any one of these things is a � causes nicotine or cigarettes to be more addictive.

MR. WALKER:  But when he says it makes them addictive, that's the same thing as being addictive.

1             THE COURT:  Okay.  Your � your objection's

2       overruled.

3             MR. WALKER:  Okay.

4             (The sidebar conference was concluded and the

5   following proceedings were held in open court in the

6   presence of the jury:)

7   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

8       Q     Okay.  We've talked about how -- when

9   R. J. Reynolds admitted cigarette smoking was addictive.

10   Have you studied, Dr. Cummings, their internal documents

11   about how long R. J. Reynolds and the other cigarette

12   manufacturers knew that cigarette smoking was addictive?

13       A     Yes.

14       Q     And let's look at a few of those documents,

15   Dr. Cummings.  How long does that knowledge go back to as

16   far as when you start looking at the documents where you

17   can � strike that.

18             How � let's go back to some earlier documents.

19   Give me a time frame of when we're talking about.

20       A     You can find that -- evidence of the importance of

21   nicotine back into the '30s, the early patents for

22   extracting nicotine out of tobacco in the '20s, but they

23   talk about the importance of nicotine in the mid '30s.

24   American Tobacco I'm referring to, I'm thinking about.

25             And then in the '50s, they began to more directly

1   use the term "addiction" --

2       Q     Okay.

3       A     --in the original documents.

4       Q     Let's look at a document.  Are you familiar with a

5   document called the "Forwarding Memorandum"?

6       A     Yes, I am.

7       Q     Okay.  And that's PT2061.  What year is this

8   document, Dr. Cummings?

9       A     This is 1953, in the December period.  It's a

10   document written by Ed Dawkins, who was an employee at

11   Hill & Knowlton, which was the public relations firm hired

12   by the cigarette companies to represent them and speak on

13   their behalf.  And he's � Mr. Dawkins, in this particular

14   forwarding memo, is describing interviews that he's done

15   with the research directors of four of the major companies

16   that had happened in mid December and summarizing their

17   views on things, like why people smoke and their knowledge

18   of the health risks and so on.

19       Q     Okay.  And this � well, strike that.

20             Okay.  Let's look at the document, forwarding

21   memorandum, to the members of the planning committee.

22             In 1953, John Price would have been how old?

23       A     In 1953?

24       Q     Yes, sir.

25       A     I guess back to 17.

1       Q     17.  Okay.

2             "Notes on the four interviews with research

3   directors are given at some length.  One of the men said,

4   'It's fortunate for us that cigarettes are a habit they

5   can't break.'  Said another, 'Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful

6   if our company was the first to produce a cancer-free

7   cigarette, what we could do to the competition.'  Said

8   another, 'Suppose everybody smoked just one less' -- 'just

9   one cigarette less a day?  That would be maybe 40 billion a

10   year . ' "

11             And, Dr. Cummings, when we're talking about the

12   first part of this, what does this have to do with the

13   addiction?  Which part of this has to do with addiction?

14       A     Well, the �

15             MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor, calls for

16       speculation and there's a pretrial order about

17       interpretation of documents.

18             MR. PRYSOCK:  I'll rephrase it, Your Honor.

19   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

20       Q     Dr. Cummings, when it talks about research

21   directors, what does it mean, research directors?

22       A    Well, these were the head of the research and --

23   research departments of the cigarette companies so --

24       Q     At this time and over the decades after that, who

25   was in a better position to know about cigarettes and the

1   propensities of cigarettes, the manufacturers of cigarettes

2   or public health and other people?

3             MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  The

4       guestion's argumentative.

5             MR. PRYSOCK:  I'll withdraw it, Your Honor.

6   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

7       Q     Dr. Cummings, based upon your research, how

8   intently did the cigarette manufacturers study the

9   propensities of their product and the changes that they made

10   in their product?

11       A     They studied it carefully.  There were no changes

12   made to the products without careful assessment of how they

13   would affect the smoking behavior of their customers and

14   ultimately their profits.  So nothing happened by accident.

15   They were very intent on making sure they designed a product

16   that was addictive and would maintain nicotine addiction in

17   their smokers because that was tied to their profits.

18       Q     Okay.  Let's look at another document, if we can,

19   PT1945.  And before we pull that up, PT1945 � and this is

20   from 1962.  What was the Battelle Hippo?

21       A     Battelle was a contract lab.  They were in the

22   United States, but they also have this particular office

23   that was a contract, it was over in Switzerland.  And so

24   they were doing research, animal studies, human smoking

25   behavior studies.

1              And their focus � they were hired by

2   British American Tobacco, which was the owner of Brown &

3   Williamson.  So they were the parent company of Brown &

4   Williamson here in the United States.  And they were doing

5   studies of why people smoke and the role of nicotine in

6   smoking behavior.

7              And Hippo was talking about hippocampus, the

8   effect of nicotine in the brain.

9        Q     And you said Brown & Williamson.  B&W, is that

10   another word for Brown & Williamson?

11        A     Yes.

12        Q     Okay.  Which -- by the way, which brand did

13   Brown & Williamson make that was very popular in the '50s?

14        A     Kool was the popular brand that they made.  They

15   also made Viceroy.

16        Q     Okay.  If we can look at this document from 1962,

17   the effects of smoking, proposal for further research

18   contracts with Battelle.  "What we need to know above all

19   things is what constitutes the hold of smoking, that is, to

20   understand addiction."

21              Is that a word that was used internally by tobacco

22   companies when discussing the hold of cigarette smoking?

23        A     Yes.

24        Q     Is that a term they used externally when they were

25   discussing whether cigarette smoking was addictive?

1        A     No.  They denied that cigarette smoking was

2   addictive and that nicotine was addictive.

3        Q     "As a result of these various researches, we

4   now possess the knowledge that the effects of nicotine is

5   far more extensive than exists in public scientific

6   literature."

7              And that was the guestion earlier I was poorly

8   phrasing, trying to ask you.  Did � what does this discuss

9   as far as what they knew internally about their own products

10   versus what public health officials and other scientists

11   knew about nicotine addiction?

12        A     Well, one of their chief scientists is basically

13   commenting on these studies that they had contracted with

14   Battelle to do, in 1959 up until this document in 1962, that

15   they had more knowledge of why people smoked and

16   specifically the hold of nicotine addiction on smoking

17   behavior that was available in the published scientific

18   literature and that they used that information to their

19   benefit.  And they did.

20              MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  If we can look at the next

21        document, PT3615.

22        Q     And who is this � whose internal document was

23       this?

24                 A           This   is   Brown   &   Williamson   again.      This   is   a  memo

25       written  by  Addison  Yeaman.      He   was   the   chief   general   counsel

1   for Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company.  He was also the

2   chairperson of the � the committee that oversaw the Council

3   for Tobacco Research.

4       Q     And which company's responsible for Brown &

5   Williamson now?

6       A     This is R. J. Reynolds today.

7       Q     Okay.  Implications of Battelle Hippo -- sorry �

8   I and II and the Ted � Ted Griffith filter.  The Griffith

9   filter.  Sorry.

10       A     Right, yes.

11       Q     "Moreover, nicotine is addictive.  We are, then,

12   in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug

13   effective in the release of stress mechanisms.  But

14   cigarettes, we will assume the Surgeon General's committee

15   to say, despite the beneficent effect of nicotine, have

16   certain unattractive side effects.

17             "They cause or predispose to lung cancer.

18             "They contribute to certain cardiovascular

23   our obligations to determine their truth or falsity by

2   constituent of smoke is currently suspect, while delivering

3   full flavor and, incidentally, a nice jolt of nicotine.

4   And, if so, we are the first to be able to make and sustain

5   that claim, what price can't."

6             Did I read that correctly, first of all?

7       A     Yes.

8       Q     Okay.  There's a few things in there.  Let me talk

9   about � first of all, after the first sentence, "Moreover

10   nicotine is addictive, we are, then, in the business of

11   selling nicotine, an addictive drug effective in the release

12   of stress mechanisms."

13             Have you seen other documents where they

14   internally talk about our business is selling dosages of

15   nicotine?

16       A     Yes.  All of the companies have these internal

17   documents.  It was well understood within the companies that

18   that was the key design feature for the cigarettes.

19       Q     Okay.  Let me ask you about a reference to certain

20   unattractive side effects and the last one, "They may be

21   truly causative in emphysema."

22             At this time, was the cigarette � the

23    cigarette industry admitting that cigarette smoking caused 2 4        emphysema?

25       A     No.

1        Q     Were they publicly stating otherwise?

2        A     Yes.  They denied any health risks to their

3   product, including cancer, heart disease, emphysema.  And

4   they did that basically through The Tobacco Institute, the

5   Tobacco Industry Research Committee right up through 1998.

6   Never did those organizations acknowledge that cigarette

7   smoking was the cause of any serious disease.

8        Q     Right.  And that's what they were assuming the

9   Surgeon General's committee was going to claim.

10              What was going on at the time with the Surgeon

11   General's office?  What � what report was -- was going on?

12              MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I need to continue to

13        object to these preambles to guestions.

19   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

20        Q     Okay.  So if we go back, those were three things

21   that they believed who was going to claim?

22        A     The Surgeon General's committee, at that time, was

23   deliberating over the evidence that they were preparing for

24   their report.  So this memo was written in July of 1963,

25   July 17th.  And the Surgeon General's Report comes out in

1   early January.  Actually, it was supposed to come out the

2   end of November, but because of the assassination of

3   President Kennedy, the release of the report was delayed

4   about a month to six weeks before they issued it.

5       Q     Okay.  And what year is this?

6       A     1963.

7       Q     So I don't have to sit up here all day, is that

8   the quote from them internally?  "We are, then, in the

9   business of selling nicotine"?

10       A     "An addictive drug."

11       Q     "An addictive drug."  Okay.

12             Hopefully -- this is why I don't write things.

13   "We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an

14   addictive drug."

15             Correct?

16       A     Right.

17       Q     Okay.  1963.  And Dr. Cummings, when did -- well,

18   we'll come back to emphysema later.  But let me ask you

19   this:  What did John Price die of? 2 0       A     He died of emphysema.

21       Q     Okay.  This was in 1963.  At this time, did --

22   Brown & Williamson or any of the other cigarette companies,

23   including RJR, did they share their research -- or this

24   research regarding addiction with the Surgeon General?

25       A     No.  They were asked to share all their research

1   that would be relevant to the committee's deliberations, but

2   we know from other internal business records that they

3   withheld the Hippo reports, although they were shared

4   with -- within the industry.  The Hippo reports were shared

5   with R. J. Reynolds specifically.

6             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  And let's look at PT978.

7       Q     So you said that that � that study that we've

8   just talked about, Battelle Hippo, that was � was that

9   shared with the defendant in this case, R. J. Reynolds?

10       A     Yes.

11       Q     Okay.  Did the defendants, including

12   R. J. Reynolds in this case, have the opportunity?  Were

13   they invited by the Surgeon General to share what they knew

14   about their own products internally?

15       A     Yes.  They were all invited to share all relevant

16   research that they had, all conclusions that they had with

17   the Surgeon General's advisory committee.

18       Q     Okay.  And this document here is PT978.  "Finch

19   agrees submission of Battelle or Griffith developments to

20   Surgeon General undesirable, and we agree, continuance of

21   Battelle work useful but disturbed at its implications

22   regarding cardiovascular disorders."

23             And this is from � who is this from?

24       A     This is Addison Yeaman.  He's referring to his

25   boss, Mr. Finch, who was the president of Brown & Williamson

1   at the time.

2        Q     And so as a result of this discussion, did -- did

3   they supply the information to the Surgeon General?

4        A     No.  We know that they did not supply the Battelle

5   reports to the Surgeon General's advisory committee.

6        Q     Okay.

7        A     Or their conclusions about that report, which is

8   that cigarettes are addictive.

9              MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  If we can look at, next,

10        PT3678.

11        Q     And this is from what year, Dr. Cummings?

12        A     1966.  It's an internal Philip Morris market

13   survey.  They're looking at marketing of a health cigarette,

14   and it's shared with the head of research and development,

15   Helmut Wakeham.  It's authored by Myron Johnston.

16        Q     And by the way, the -- we're going to talk more

17   about the conspiracy later.  But what year did the

20   over the next 45 years until they've disbanded The Tobacco

21    Institute and the Council For Tobacco Research in 1998.

22        Q     Okay.  And that first meeting took place where in

23   1953?

24        A     Plaza Hotel.

25              It was called by the president of American

1   Tobacco.  And he sent a telegram to all of the heads of the

2   companies to come and meet and discuss how they could

3   address the crisis that had happened in 1953 with a drop in

4   their stock prices as a result of information coming out,

5   implicating their product was a cause of cancer.

6        Q     And we're going to get more into that.  But what I

7   want to ask you right now, because I don't think I tied this

8   in before, who was involved in the conspiracy, and who was

9   at that meeting, which companies?

10        A     Well, Philip Morris was at the meeting, American

11   Tobacco, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco, Brown &

12   Williamson Tobacco Company.

13        Q     So now let's look at this document, internal --

14              MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I have an objection to

15        this document, based on a ruling Your Honor made before

16        trial.

17              THE COURT:  Okay.

18              MR. PRYSOCK:  If � I think I know what the

19        objection � it may be better for me just to ask a

20        couple more guestions so we don't have to come up yet.

21        I won't show the document yet.

22              THE COURT:  Okay.

24                 Q           Dr.   Cummings,   as   part   of  the   conspiracy,   what   did

1   publicly about the addictive effects of smoking or the

2   smoking addiction?

3       A     Sure.  I mean, they created these two

4   organizations.  The Tobacco Industry Research Committee was

5   announced publicly in 1954 in the Frank Statement.  It was

6   located one floor behind -- below Hill & Knowlton, the

7   public relations firm that they had hired.  And they had a

8   communications committee that would put out information on

9   issues related to smoking and health, including addiction

10   and health risks and so on.

11             In 1958, the communications committee of the TIRC

12   was spun into the Tobacco Institute so they'd have a

13   separate organization that just did the public speaking on

14   issues related to smoking and health for the cigarette

15   companies.

16       Q     But it � I'm sorry.  As part of the conspiracy,

17   what did they conceal as far as nicotine goes?

18             MR. WALKER:  Objection, leading.

19             THE COURT:  Overruled.

20       A     They concealed that nicotine was an addictive drug

21   and was the reason that people smoked.  And they concealed

22   how they engineered their products to make their cigarettes

23   hard to guit.

24                 Q           Did  all   those   companies   at   that   Plaza  meeting  then

25        engage   in  a   conspiracy?     Did  they   all   --   strike   that.

1             What -- were they in unison about their position

2   publicly in denying the health � denying the addiction of

3   nicotine?

4       A     Yes.

5       Q     If one � and did they all know internally about

6   the � how addictive nicotine really was?

7       A     Well, we now know, looking back at their business

8   records, that they knew that their products were addictive

9   and that they engineered their products to cause and sustain

10   that addiction, and that was something that was concealed

11   from the American public until the conspiracy ended, and the

12   companies essentially finally came around to acknowledge

13   what they had known for decades.

14       Q     And did that conspiracy include � the concealment

15   of the addictive effects of nicotine, did it include

16   Philip Morris and R. J. Reynolds and Brown & Williamson?

17       A     Yes, it did.

18       Q     If one of those companies had come forward

19   publicly and announced what they knew internally, would the

20   conspiracy downplaying the addictive nature of nicotine �

21   would it have worked if one of them had told what they knew

22   internally?

23       A     No.  The conspiracy and the concealment would have

24   been uncovered, and that's exactly what happened with

25   Liggett & Myers in the late 1990s, finally came clean.  And

1   that's when the conspiracy ended.

2       Q     So as part of the conspiracy, what the companies,

3   including R. J. Reynolds and Philip Morris, knew internally,

4   was that part of the conspiracy?

5       A     Yes.

6             MR. PRYSOCK:  All right.  Now, if we can pull that

7       document up, PT --

8             MR. WALKER:  I still have the same objection,

9       although if I could � I'm not sure what he's intending

10       to show from this document.

11             THE COURT:  Come to sidebar and we'll handle that.

12             MR. WALKER:  Thank you.

13             Can I just confer with counsel for a moment?

14             THE COURT:  Yes.  That would be fine.

15             MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I have � I'll withdraw

16       my objection for the moment for what � what's going to

18             THE COURT:  Okay.

19   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

20       Q     Okay.  Let's look at PT3678 from Philip Morris,

21   1966.  "A cigarette that does not deliver nicotine cannot

22   satisfy the habituated smoker and cannot lead to habituation

23   and would, therefore, almost certainly fail.  Health claims

24   alone without flavor or nicotine cannot sell cigarettes.

25   Most smokers would rather guit than switch."

1             And, Dr. Cummings, is that your � strike that.

2             Let me ask you, would cigarette smokers without

3   nicotine � based upon your studies and behaviors, what

4   would be the likelihood people would continue to smoke if

5   the nicotine was left out of cigarettes?

6       A     Most people would stop smoking altogether.

7       Q     If the � if nicotine was left out of -- is that

8   consistent with what Philip Morris knew internally?

9       A     Yes.

10       Q     If the cigarette � if the nicotine was left out

11   of cigarettes, what is your opinion as to whether a

12   cigarette would be a choice cigarette versus a need

13   cigarette?

14             MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  It's

15       argumentative.

16             THE COURT:  Overruled.

17       A     If -- if they left the nicotine out, it would be a

18   choice for the smoker.  Leaving the nicotine in and

19   sufficient amount of nicotine to sustain addiction

20   constrains choice.  That's what addiction is.

21       Q     Okay.  If we could pull up � and have you seen

22   R. J. Reynolds discussing nicotine addiction going back

23   decades?

2       Q     RJR confidential research planning memorandum on

3   the nature of the tobacco business and the crucial role of

4   nicotine therein.

5             Is that -- have you seen this document before?

6       A     Yes.  This is authored by Claude Teague, who was

7   one of their senior scientists.  At this point in his

8   career, he's involved in new product development, and

9   he's talking about why people smoke and how to actually

10   research ways to deliver nicotine to smokers in an

11   efficient way.

12       Q     "In a sense, the tobacco industry may be thought

13   of as a specialized, highly ritualized and stylized segment

14   of the pharmaceutical industry.  Tobacco products uniguely

15   contain and deliver nicotine, a potent drug with a variety

16   of physiological effects.  Thus a tobacco product is, in

17   essence, a vehicle for delivery of nicotine designed to

18   deliver the nicotine in a generally acceptable and

19   attractive form.  Our industry is then based upon design,

20   manufacture and sale of attractive dosages" � "dosage forms

21   of nicotine.

22             "And our company's position in our industry is

23   determined by our ability to produce dosage forms of

24   nicotine, which more overall value, tangent" -- "tangible

25   or intangible, to the consumer than those of our

1   competitors."

2             Now, there's a lot there, Dr. Cummings, but let me

3   ask you a couple things.

4             One, in the first paragraph, it talks about

5   nicotine being a potent drug with a variety of physiological

6   effects.  At the time, were the tobacco companies publicly

7   admitting that it was a potent drug?

8       A     No.

9       Q     And it talks about physiological effects.

10   Physiological meaning what?

11       A     It has a biological effect on your system.  You

12   know, a drug addiction is a physiological condition or

13   disease and not a psychological problem.  So this isn't a

14   character flaw from somebody.  They're talking about, you

15   know, altering somebody's physiology, specifically the

16   brain, where nicotine has its effects.

17       Q     "Our industry is then based upon design,

18   manufacture and the sale of attractive dosage forms of

19   nicotine."

20             When you're talking about dosage forms of

21   nicotine, what does that refer to as far as how smokers �

22             MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  There's a

23       pretrial order.

24             MR. PRYSOCK:  I'll rephrase the guestion.

1        Q     When a smoker smokes a cigarette, how many dosages

2   of nicotine do they get?

3        A     On average, they're getting ten hits of nicotine.

4   That's on average, about ten puffs.  And each puff is a way

5   of dosing the nicotine.  And you -- you can adjust the

6   amount of nicotine by how hard or long you hold the puff in

7   your system and � and that's carefully studied.

8              So that's 10 per cigarette.  You know, 20

9   cigarettes a day, you're talking 200 administrations of the

10   drug nicotine.  If you smoke two packs a day, you're up to

11    400.  So that repeated exposure to an addictive substance is

12   what dominates why people literally smoke themselves into a

13   grave.

14        Q     Okay.  And so we looked at a couple documents

15   about what the cigarette industry knew going back then.

16   Have you seen documents where the cigarette industry is

17   discussing what its customers, like John Price, knew about

18   nicotine addiction?

19        A     Yes.

20              MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  Let's look at one of those,

21        if we could, PT2077.

22        Q     And this is a � again, you said Brown &

23   Williamson � B&W is Brown & Williamson; is that correct?

24        A     Right.  This is Brown & Williamson.  These are two

25   people in their marketing department.  They had done a

Veritext Reporting Company 212-2 7 9-9424                          www.veritext.com                          212-490-3 430

1   marketing study and looking at people's perceptions of

2   nicotine.  And they note that very few customers are aware

3   of the effects of nicotine, its addictive nature and that

4   nicotine is a poisonous � that's 1978.

5             And that's consistent with polls that were

6   available at this time, where they asked people about

7   whether cigarette smoking was a habit or an addiction.  Most

8   people did not claim it to be a habit -- or claim it to be

9   an addiction.  They called it a "habit."

10       Q     Habit meaning just what � something you're used

11   to doing?

12       A     Yeah, just � you get up in the morning, you brush

13   your teeth.  You know, a habit, I pick out a tie to wear.

14   This isn't a drug-reinforced behavior, where people are

15   smoking a cigarette first thing before they plunk their foot

16   on the floor.

17       Q     Let me ask you this:  Just in general, if you're

18   talking about any consumer, any smoker, who's smoking two to

19   three packs a day, Dr. Cummings, where does that rate on the

20   scale of smoking behavior?

21       A     Well, that would be defined as a highly addicted

22   smoker.  They call it a "heavy smoker."  The National Cancer

23   Institute funded a research project that I was principal

24   investigator of in the mid 1980s, called the "heavy smoker

25   trial," where they defined a heavy smoker as somebody

1   smoking 25 or more cigarettes.  And they were trying to

2   develop interventions to address that heavy smoker group

3   because that was the group that experienced so many more of

4   the diseases related to smoking.

5       Q     And how many cigarettes are in � two to three

6   packs is how many cigarettes?

7       A     Well, typically, most packs of cigarettes have 20

8   cigarettes, so if you're two to three packs, you're � you

9   know, 50 cigarettes a day.  That's a � that's an extreme

10   level.

11             I mean, if you look at how many people in the mid

12   '80s were heavy smokers, because we had to estimate that to

13   do our study, it was � it was about 8 percent of the

14   population.  So it was a minority of the overall smoking

15   population.  Most people were a pack or under.  So to get 25

16   or more, those were the extreme heavy smokers.

17       Q     Dr. Cummings, we've -- so we've talked about --

18   we've looked at a few documents about what the companies

19   knew about addiction.  By the way, are there other

20   documents?

21       A     There are a ton of documents on nicotine addiction

22   and � and many that also go into the details of engineering

23       the  product.

24                 Q           Okay.      And  have   you   also   seen  those   documents,

25       where   �  or  have  you   seen  documents  where   �  that  were

15   sending it to his boss, Dr. DiMarco, who had recently, at

16   this time in the early '80s, had been appointed as the head

17   of R&D at Reynolds.  And he's talking about the Richard

18   Nordine study.  Mr. Nordine was in the marketing department,

19   and they had done guite an extensive study of U.S.

20   population to look at trends and smoking behavior, consumer

21   attitudes, whether smokers guit, their ability to guit.  And

22   he comments on the indications of that study in this memo.

	Q     Okay.  Let's see what Dr. Teague wrote, if we can.

7
	"Some other things perhaps not so" -- "not guite

8
	so obvious need consideration.  Most of those who smoked for ji

9
	any significant time would like to stop."

10
	Is that true, based upon your studies of thousands \

11
	of smokers, Dr. Cummings?

12
	A     Yes, it is.

13
	Q     "Many but not most of those who would like to stop I

14
	smoking are unable to do so."

15
	Did I read that correctly, first of all?

16
	A     You did.

17
	Q     Oh, I'm sorry.

18
	A     "But not most."

19
	Q     Oh, I'm sorry.  "But not most of those who would

20
	like to stop smoking are able to do so."

21
	So we've got a couple double negatives.  What �

22
	restated, what does that mean, Dr. Cummings?

1             THE COURT:  Sustained.

2       Q     Okay.  Well, we can -- we can see it and see what

3   it says.

4             The � the � as far as your studies,

5   Dr. Cummings, what does that relate to as far as smokers and

6   their ability to guit smoking?

7       A     They reflect -- what my studies show and my

8   experience has been working with many thousands of smokers

9   is most smokers would like to stop.  Many have tried to stop

10   but most are unable to do so easily.  That reguires repeated

11   effort and struggle.

12             Most people don't understand why it's so hard to

13   guit, and they don't understand how the product has been

14   engineered.  And so it's a reflection of the fact that it's

15   hard to stop smoking once you get addicted.

16       Q     Okay.  And let's look at another document, if we

17   could, Dr. Cummings.  Have you seen also where the � these

18   companies discuss the business aspect of � of cigarette

19   smoking and addiction?

20       A     Yeah.  Dr. Teague goes on here to talk about the

21   entry and exit gates for the market, so the � their sales

22   are based on how many new people they're recruiting into the

23   market to replace those who guit and died, as well as their

24   ability to retain those who are smokers.

25             And he points out that we should be able to

1   maintain or increase the size of the total market by

2   influencing the entry and exit rates.  He says "However, we

3   cannot be comfortable selling a product which most of our

4   customers would stop using, if they could."

5             "That is to say, if the exit gate from our market

6   would" -- "should suddenly open, we could be out of business

7   almost overnight."

8             And it goes on to talk about some ineffective ways

9   that existed in the early '80s for quitting smoking, but he

10   said at some point, they may actually come up with a method

11   that all people will leave the market.  He said if � you

12   know, what are our options?  If and when that occurs, our

13   options include go out of business, find a way to eliminate

14   the desire of smokers to stop smoking and then provide other

15   products away from conventional cigarettes, which meet the

16   same needs cigarettes now meet without the associated

17   negatives, like emphysema, heart disease and cancer.

18       Q     Okay.  And have you seen other documents that

19   are consistent with this discussion of their business model

20   and what would happen if people, in large � in large

21   quantities, were able to stop -- or were able to quit

22        smoking?

23                                 MR.   WALKER:      Your  Honor,    I   have   to   object.      The

24                  question's   argumentative.      The   document   didn't   say

25                   "business   model."     He's  put   that   into   the   question.

3             MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

4   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

5       Q     Have you seen documents that discuss business

6   model and why and how nicotine addiction plays into that?

7       A     Yes.

8             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  Let's look at PT1809.

9       Q     Are you familiar with this document, Dr. Cummings?

10       A     Yes.  This is an internal Philip Morris document,

11   written by William Dunn, who is � Dr. Dunn was in charge of

12   their human behavioral research program at Philip Morris, to

13   his boss, Tom Osdene, who was, at the time, the head of R&D

14   at Philip Morris.  And he's talking about � essentially

15   talking about the role of their research program on human

16   smoking behavior and how that is important to the profits of

17   Philip Morris.

18       Q     "First, every undertaking has to have some

19   mission.  I would state our charter from Philip Morris in

20   this fashion:  Study the psychology of the smoker in search

21   of information that can increase corporate profits."

22             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  Let's go to the next.

23       Q     "There are some distinctive features about the

24   cigarette market.  We sell a product that is bought often

25   and used from 10 to 60 times a day, day in, day out.  We

2   habitual act."

3             You are familiar with Pavlov's dog --

4             MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I'm sorry.  I need to

5       make an objection, and I'd ask to be heard about this

6       document and the procedure that's being used here.

7             MR. PRYSOCK:  Take it down.

8             THE COURT:  Okay.  Come to sidebar.

9             Folks, while I'm doing this, I think we might need

10       to take a break to use the restroom so just about five

11       minutes.  So you can go on back to the jury room.  I'll

12       bring you right back in in about five minutes.

13             (Jury excused.)

14             (A sidebar conference was held outside the hearing

15   of the jury as follows:)

16             MR. WALKER:  You still want me up here?  We can

17       take it up after you come back, Your Honor.

18             THE COURT:  That's okay.  Let's get this done.

19             MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, there are two issues.

20             The first is there are a series of Philip Morris

21       documents that are being used that were identified in

22       pretrial hearings.  Your Honor's ruling at that time was

23       that you wanted to hear a foundation for each of those

24       documents.  They're being pulled up before I have a

25       chance to � before any -- they're being discussed

I would just ask, at least for Philip Morris documents, that they be identified and have a chance to pull them up first before they --

THE COURT:  Why don't you do � why don't you take the next few minutes and grab the next several documents you're going to pull up?  Because we're going to go to lunch at 12:15.

MR. WALKER:  Yes, sir, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Why don't you do that?

MR. PRYSOCK:  I thought I laid the foundation on the addiction aspect of this, the internal Philip Morris -- that's what I did a few minutes ago, but I can do it each time, if I need to.

Page 1255 never went to R. J. or any � R. J. Reynolds or any of

those people, right?

MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.  Essentially it's a hearsay objection because the statements he wants to show were not made in furtherance of a conspiracy.  This is someone's conceptual model that he's describing.

THE COURT:  Let me see.  I can't � I can't tell. Can we see it?

MR. WALKER:  It's a document �

THE COURT:  Can you put it on the wall?

MR. WALKER:  Sure.  They have it to show you.

So the � this is a Philip Morris internal document, and at the top it says "I'll try to describe the conceptual model that we are using."

And he's talking about it in the paragraph above. This is research that they're proposing to do internally at Philip Morris and in the future.  And he's just describing -- this isn't even research.  He's just describing the concept that he wants to use for the research that they're going to do.  And it's not distributed outside of the company.

So I don't see how that meets any kind of foundation reguirement for this case.

MR. PRYSOCK:  I think he meant you.

MR. MITNIK:  Oh, you don't want me out here?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Right.  It's an internal Philip Morris document, but what I was about to describe is why it's important because they, in unison, publicly denied � and this is what we talked about at the pretrial conference, Your Honor.  Your Honor picked up on this.  I have to show internally that the co-conspirators, not just one, not just R. J. Reynolds, but the co-conspirators all knew that nicotine was addictive.  And this is Philip Morris, who R. J. Reynolds publicly decided together, we're going to say nicotine is not addictive.  We're going to tell

So I have to show Philip Morris, also one of the co-conspirators, knew internally.  It wasn't just RJR. It was the co-conspirators too and what they knew internally.  That's the first part, Your Honor.

The second part, this hearsay argument, which I've never heard before, this is a statement of a co-conspirator.  Statements of co-conspirators are admissible.  It also goes to state of mind.  It's the state of mind of the head of research at Philip Morris at the time as to how addictive nicotine is.

And the next page talks about if we don't have nicotine in our products, our � it talks about the business model.  We would not stay in business.

This is Philip Morris's understanding internally, just before they go publicly, which I'm about to show, along with R. J. Reynolds together and the other heads and talk about it.

MR. WALKER:  Respectfully, Your Honor, it doesn't become � it doesn't fit the co-conspirator exception to hearsay just because Mr. Prysock says so.  The exception reguires that the statements to be admitted be made � the statements have to have been made in furtherance of the conspiracy.

Second, he's saying he has to prove that nicotine

Page 1258 is addictive.  They have a finding that they're going to

use for that purpose.  So I don't -- he's already shown

Philip Morris documents that talk about nicotine being

addictive.  What he wants from this document is wherever

this researcher is, not talking about research that's

been conducted or the results of some research program

but his -- he wants to attribute his concept comparing

smokers to rats and to Pavlov's dog, and he wants to

attribute that somehow to Reynolds, even though this

document didn't go to Reynolds or any companies that are

part of Reynolds.  And there's no documents like it that

have these statements, in any of the documents from

those companies.

MR. MITNIK:  Judge, I want to know �

thinking.

MR. MITNIK:  Your Honor, can I say one guick --

MR. MITNIK:  While they're digging, can I say �

it won't take 15 seconds.  It was what I said at the

hearing.  I just want to say it in my way, if I might.

Here's the point:  When all those gentlemen testified

before Congress, one them was a Philip Morris guy, who

says, "I too believe this is not addictive."

Page   1259 THE   COURT:      That's   what   Mr.   Prysock   �

MR. MITNIK:  This is what he had to say.

We had to then show each one wasn't telling the truth because -- and not just they weren't telling the truth but the extent of the depth of their belief to the contrary.  This is not just, hey, it's addictive.  It shows that Philip Morris individually, that company, thought not only is it addictive; it's extraordinarily addictive.  And then I turned around, in furtherance of the conspiracy along with others, and said this.

If we don't show each individual knew it wasn't true, he might have believed it was true when he stood up and said it.

MR. PRYSOCK:  And then this is the other part of what they say.  "Without the chemical compound, the cigarette market would collapse," the chemical compound being nicotine.

MR. WALKER:  They just showed a Philip Morris document that said that.  That was the one we had the fuss about and we came up.  They don't -- this is not something that they have � they're trying to tell you, we need this to show that Philip Morris knew nicotine was addictive.  We just went over a document like that. I had an objection.  I withdrew it.

THE COURT:  I understand.  And now I'm going to ask a guestion I thought the ladies were figuring out. And I don't mean to � I mean, I hope that's not offensive.

MS. WEIZENECKER:  No.

THE COURT:  Just that y'all were working together.

Has this been admitted against R. J. Reynolds without Philip Morris?

MS. WEIZENECKER:  I � I can look at that, Your Honor.

MR. WALKER:  It probably has somewhere been admitted, if I can save some time.

THE COURT:  I think it's been � okay.  Has it been rejected?

MR. WALKER:  Now, that I don't know the answer to, Your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. Why don't � you said you had ten minutes. Of course, now we've been doing this ten minutes.

MR. PRYSOCK: I've got this document. I've got the Waxman hearing and then I'm done with this topic, Your Honor.  But I need this to show what the Waxman

2        the addiction and Philip Morris and the depth of their

3        knowledge on things.

4              MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.  It has been

5        excluded in a case where Philip Morris was not a party,

6        the Dupre case.

7              THE COURT:  Where was that?

8              MR. WALKER:  I believe Dupre was Sarasota,

9        Your Honor.  This was in the last year or two.

10              THE COURT:  Okay.  And what happened here in

11        Jacksonville in Sermons?

12              MR. WALKER:  It probably � it was admitted,

13        Your Honor.

14              THE COURT:  And was Philip Morris still a party at

15        that stage?

16              MR. WALKER:  Philip Morris was a party throughout

17        the case, right up to Phase II.

18              THE COURT:  Okay.  Has it been admitted over

19        objection against R. J. Reynolds?

20              MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I � Ms. � I'm sure the

21        answer is yes.  I can try to confirm, if you want the

THE COURT:  You don't � you don't have that information.

MR. WALKER:  We have that it was admitted in Bowden, Allen and Sermons.  I know Philip Morris was in Sermons.

MR. SEIDEN:  They were in Bowden as well.

MR. WALKER:  And they can tell you whether they were in Allen.  I wasn't involved in Allen.  I don't know.

MR. MITNIK:  How about Allen?

MS. WEIZENECKER:  I don't have it.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me just tell you, I'm not going to hold off.  If you want to hold off on this and do the other and can come back to it later, I'm not going to keep the jury out any longer.  If you want to do the Waxman hearing now, then that's fine.

13       Q     Okay.  Dr. Cummings, just a couple more guestions

14   on addiction before lunch.  Have you seen internal

15   documents -- well, first of all, let me ask you this:  Can

16   or cannot R. J. Reynolds and the other tobacco companies

17   control the levels of nicotine in their cigarettes?

18       A     They can and they do.

19       Q     And are they able to make cigarettes with �

20   without nicotine in it or with incredibly low levels of

21   nicotine in it?

22       A     Yes.  There are extraction procedures, patents for

23   taking nicotine out of tobacco that date back to the '20s.

24   They can cross-breed tobacco plants and get very low levels

25   of nicotine or a hybrid �

Page 1265 Q     Can they grow it?  Can they grow tobacco without

nicotine or with very low levels of nicotine that would not

be addictive?

A     Yes, through their cross-hybridization and now with bioengineering, changing the DNA.  They can alter the DNA of the tobacco plant and grow it naturally out of the ground with virtually no nicotine in it.

Q     Okay.  And have you seen documents where they discuss varying � or varying the level of nicotine?

A     Yes.

Q     Including R. J. Reynolds?

A     Yes.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  If you could pull up PT1835.

Q     And this is 1971, Dr. Murray Senkus.  Who was Dr. Senkus at R. J. Reynolds?

A     Dr. Senkus was, at this time, the head of R&D, research and development, at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, and Mr. Laurene was -- Dr. Laurene was head of their chemistry unit there.

Q     As a result of discussions with Dr. Teague and other scientists, correct?

A     Correct.

Q           With   --   and  with   section  heads,   the   following  are

2              Did I read that correctly, first of all?

3        A     Yes.

4        Q     Dr. Cummings, who at R. J. Reynolds makes the

5   choice as to how much nicotine to put in the cigarettes that

6   they sell to their customers?

7        A     Oh, R. J. Reynolds.  The company makes that choice

8   and has always made that choice to control the level of

9   nicotine in their product and determine how long they will

10   go.

11              MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor, nonresponsive.

12              THE COURT:  Overruled.

13   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

14        Q     The � we've looked at the internal documents from

15   several of the companies.  And, again, are there many other

16   documents that discuss nicotine addiction internally and

17   what they knew?

18        A     Yes.

19        Q     What were the Waxman hearings?

20        A     1994, in April, the heads of the cigarette

21   companies were asked to appear before Congressman Waxman's

22   committee and give testimony about the health effects of

23   smoking.  And one of the topics that they were guestioned

24   about is whether cigarettes are addictive and nicotine as

25   being addictive.

1       Q     And that was United States Congress?

2       A     Yes.

3       Q     So even though I wrote it very poorly, 1963 was we

4   are then in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive

5   drug.

6       A     That's right.

7       Q     And that was the secret document, right?

8       A     That's right.

9       Q     And then we went through the other ones.  And

10   Waxman was in?

11       A     In 1994, April.

12       Q     And was the � were the Waxman hearings televised?

13   Was it publicized?

14       A     Most certainly got wide publicity.  I think it was

15   on C-SPAN or CNBC, one of those.  It was picked up and

16   covered on the news.

18   R. J. Reynolds testifying?

20   R. J. Reynolds and the other CEOs.

22   R. J. Reynolds?  I mean, was there anybody higher up at

23   R. J. Reynolds than him? 2 4       A     No.

16       Q     Dr. Cummings, is that a consistent position they

17   maintained publicly prior to that time and after that time

18   until they finally admitted it a decade or so later?

19       A     Yes, when Liggett & Myers � the CEO of Liggett &

20   Myers finally came out in 1997 and admitted that cigarettes

21   were addictive and caused cancer and emphysema and that they

22   had known it for decades, that began to change and ended the

23   conspiracy essentially.  And the other companies � I think

24   Philip Morris in October of 2000 -- finally admitted their

25   products were addictive, and it was a little later for

THE COURT:  Keep your seats.

Y'all ready?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir, Your Honor.  I'd like to go back to the document we were discussing before, PT1809.  That was the Philip Morris document.

THE COURT:  Okay.

MR. PRYSOCK:  The Court asked whether it had been admitted, and counsel said they weren't sure.

So we took the time during lunch, Your Honor, and this document in other trials where Philip Morris was not a defendant, it was admitted in the Evers case, which is a case Mr. Walker was lead counsel.  It was admitted in the Dion case, which is another case Mr. Walker � and that was � Philip Morris was not in that trial, Your Honor, the Dion case with Mr. Walker as counsel.  It was admitted in the McCabe case with Mr. Walker's partner as lead counsel with no Philip Morris in there.  It was also admitted in the Ward case without Philip Morris, the

THE COURT:  And the idea is to admit this for the purpose of showing the Philip Morris and � knows this stuff and their involvement in the conspiracy.

MR. PRYSOCK:  And their involvement in the conspiracy.

And they are saying the same things publicly as R. J. Reynolds.  And it wasn't just that R. J. Reynolds knew.  All of them knew and jointly were saying the same things publicly as co-conspirators.

And I have to show that the co-conspirators, RJR and the others that they all met up with and made this � and hatched this plan, as they call it, together, that they internally knew, each of them knew that it was addictive and the propensity, the depths of how addictive it was.

THE COURT:  Okay.  What did you want to say, Mr. Walker?

MR. WALKER:  I just want to say, Your Honor, I think when you asked the question I said it probably has been admitted.

THE COURT:  No, no.  Mr. Walker, I don't think you misled me one iota.  And I don't have any idea

MR. WALKER:  It seemed like there was an effort to call me out, and some of those cases were five years ago.

THE COURT:  I hope y'all understand this, and I'm sincere about this:  When people � I don't see any calling out, and I reject any calling out unless I see � unless the lawyer somehow demonstrates to me that they aren't being forthright in my courtroom, then I � then it's not � it's not persuasive at all.

MR. PRYSOCK:  And that was not my intent, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  And I know that.

MR. WALKER:  Understood, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  And so I just � but I do understand the heat of the battle, and I don't have any problem with that either.

MR. WALKER:  Yes, sir.  The only substantive response I wanted to say is the one I said before. The purpose for which Mr. Prysock says he has to have this document to show that Philip Morris knew something internally, he already showed another Philip Morris document literally right before this one that said the thing that he says he has to have

wasn't sent to Reynolds.

It's not like they did a study and he's reporting on the study or its � this is just someone describing the model that they were planning to use for future research.  And I think that's different than the one � than the one that they showed before that.

THE COURT:  And here's how I'm ruling:

You may do it if you lay the foundation so it's clear to the jury that it is Philip Morris, this is not R. J. Reynolds, and it never went to R. J. Reynolds.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  But for the purpose of the conspiracy, that's a different purpose.  And that's the reason it's being admitted.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Understood.

THE COURT:  Thank you.  Can the witness come to the witness stand.

And, Dr. Cummings, you heard what I just said, but I don't want you to volunteer it.  I want him to lay the foundation.

THE WITNESS:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

2   R. J. Reynolds � not R. J. Reynolds but internal

3   documents that were not R. J. Reynolds' or shared with

4   R. J. Reynolds, but co-conspirator documents where it is

5   discussed why nicotine addiction is so important in

6   their business model?

7       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

14       Q    Okay.  And the date of this document � and who |

15   was this document � which company?

16       A    This is Philip Morris in 1977.  It's a document

17   from Dr. Dunn to his boss, Dr. Osdene.  Dr. Dunn, who

18   basically ran the human behavioral program for Philip

19   Morris.

20       Q    Scientist?

21       A    He was a scientist, yes.

2            MR. PRYSOCK:  If you could go on.

3   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

4       Q    There is some distinctive features about the

5   cigarette market.  We sell a product that is bought

6   often and used from 10 to 60 times a day, day in, day

7   out.  We provide a product that is the essential

8   commodity of a habitual act.  You are familiar with

9   Pavlov's dog.  Present a dog food, he salivates.  Ring a

10   bell each time you present the food, and in due time you

11   can ring the bell without the food and he will salivate.

12   Put a hungry rat in a cage, put a lever in the cage,

13   make it so that a push on the lever delivers a pellet of

14   food.  In its random movements, the rat will push the

15   lever.  He'll get the pellet.  The rat will soon

16   associate lever pushing with the food pellet.  In time,

17   he will be rapidly pushing the lever for food.

18             Consider the smoker.  Smoking the cigarette �

19   smoking the cigarette is the lever press.  The effect of

20   that smoking act upon his person is the reward.  That

21   effect reinforces the smoking act.  He comes to push the

22   lever 10 to 60 times per day.  Our task is to understand

23   the reinforcing mechanism or process whereby the habit

24   is established and maintained.  Such is our model.

25   Conceptually simple on the surface, but the complexities

1   lurk in numbers beneath the surface.

2            What is the reinforcing mechanism that is being

3   discussed here in this document?

4       A    Well, they go on to talk about the chemical

5   compound.

6       Q    And what is the chemical compound?

7       A    Nicotine.

8            And they talk about what would happen if

9   nicotine were removed.

10       Q    Without the chemical compound, the cigarette

11   market would collapse, PM would collapse, and we'd all

12   lose our jobs and consulting fees.

13             Is that what you were referring to as far as

14   the discussion what the chemical compound was?

15       A    Yes, plus he outlines in this memo research

16   about the dose of the compound that needs to be

17   maintained and the study � the aspects of human

18   behavior.  And they're using operant conditioning, you

19   know, a modeling that's been used to explain human

20   behavior and how that can be applied understanding

21   smoking behavior.

22       Q    And this was a Philip Morris document, correct?

23       A    Yes.

24       Q    Okay.  Not one from RJR that was shared with 2 5        RJR?

1       A    No.  This is internal to Philip Morris.

2       Q    But at the time � this was � was this just

3   prior or a few years prior to the Waxman hearings where

4   we saw before lunch?

5       A    This is a number of years prior to that, about

6   almost 20 years.  This is 1977.  The Waxman hearings

7   were 1994.

8       Q    And is that � Philip Morris was present at

9   that hearing along with R. J. Reynolds; is that correct?

10   The Waxman hearing that we saw?

11       A    Correct.  Yes.

12       Q    Okay.  I'd like to move to a different subject

13   now, and let me ask you as you start this, Dr. Cummings,

14    just to get some statistics:

15             In the United States today, how many Americans

16   die each year as a result of cigarette smoking?

17       A    It's estimated at about a half a million �

18   yeah, half a million, 500,000 deaths a year, roughly.

19       Q    And since 1964, approximately how many

20   Americans have died as a result of exposure to cigarette

21   smoke from R. J. Reynolds and the other major tobacco

22   companies?

23       A    Over 20 million.

24       Q    Prior to � and if we go back in time, prior to

25   1900, how many cases of lung cancer had been reported

1   worldwide?

2       A    If we go back to the turn of the 20th century,

3   it was less than 200 cases.  So it was a rare disease

5   sales in this country and in other countries as well.

6       Q    Okay.  I'd like to talk about how we got from

7   there, less than 200 cases worldwide, to where we are

8   now, half a million �

9       A    Okay.                                                                                                |

10       Q    � a year.

11             First of all, why is our � have you heard of

12   the 20th century from 1900 until the end of the century,

13   2000 � have you heard that referred to as the cigarette

14   century?

15       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

16       Q    And why is it often referred to as the

17   cigarette century?  We're going to go into it, but just

18   a very brief synopsis.

19       A    Very few people smoked cigarettes at the

20   beginning of the 20th century.  It really took off with

21   the creation of the modern blended cigarette which

22   facilitated inhalation and created addiction.  That

23   really took off with the introduction of Camel

24   cigarettes in 1913, and then the other companies

25   followed with their brands blended in the same way, and

1   cigarette consumption rose.  About 10 to 15 years later

2   we started to see a rapid increase in lung cancer, and

3   other diseases as well, but predominantly lung cancer

4   because it's so closely linked to cigarette smoking.

5   And that epidemic has continued to this day really, but

6   has begun to dissipate as the prevalence of smoking

7   began to decline in men and women, and the patterns

8   follow, exactly mirror the cigarette consumption.

9       Q    So as we go back to the beginning and in the

10   years leading up to John Price's birth, why is that

11   important in context to understand why Mr. Price, as a

12   young person, chose to start smoking?

13            What's important about that in your testimony?

14       A    Well, it shows that � well, first of all,

15   cigarettes become normalized, a normal lifestyle

16   behavior that, you know, was an accepted kind of thing.

17   And his birth cohort, if you take men born in the same

18   year as he was, about 75 percent, you know, three out of

19   four, would have become smokers in their lifetime.

20            And so it was a normal thing, and the

21   consequences of that were predictable, you know, with

22   regards to the development of the diseases that are

23   linked to cigarette smoking, emphysema being one of

24   them, being a common one linked to cigarette smoking.

25       Q    Bear with me just a moment.

1            All right.  Before the rise of the modern

2   cigarette in this century, had tobacco been used for

3   hundreds of years?

4       A    Yes.  The predominant way tobacco was used

5   before the 20th century and into the earlier part of the

6   20th century was chewing tobacco, so oral tobacco that

7   you put in your mouth and chew or suck on, and cigars,

8   pipe tobacco, usually a single blend.  Pipe and cigar

9   tobacco that was used tended to be relatively harsh and

10   difficult to inhale, so it was predominantly related to

11   diseases of the mouth but not of the lung or other parts

12   of the body.

13             Cigarettes were available at that time.  They

14   were more of a novelty item.  You know, really it

15   wasn't � it wasn't until around the turn of the 20th

16   century they automated the making of cigarettes.  And so

17   in order to make cigarettes, you'd actually have to hand

18   roll them.  And, you know, they would have workers who

19   would hand roll the cigarettes, but it was labor

20   intensive and expensive to produce them.  And when they

21   automated the making of cigarettes using a machine to do

22   it, that transformed the industry.

23            And then the blending of the product, most of

24   the hand-rolled cigarettes were made of Turkish tobacco,

25   very low nicotine-content tobacco, and so it was not

1   particularly addictive.

2             Early tobacco predominantly used in cigars in

3   that era, high nicotine content, highly addictive if you

4   could inhale it, but because it was so harsh, it wasn't

5   inhaled.  So we really didn't have the persistent daily

6   use of cigarettes that's common even today with

7   cigarette use, which is the pattern of addiction that

8   you see.

9       Q    And prior to this rise of cigarettes in the

10   cigarette century, these other forms of tobacco �

11   pipes, cigars, things like that � did we have rampant

12   or epidemic proportion diseases from casual use of those

13   products?

14       A    Well, you had some diseases.  Early on you can

15   find references to oral cancer that's related to pipe

16   tobacco and cigar smoking.  The pipe smoking from the

17   tar on the end of the � the pipe usually on the lip.

18             You find some evidence of spreading

19   communicable disease because of spitting tobacco, so the

20   chewing tobacco, and you used to have spittoons.  And

21   because of that concern, in many parts of the country,

22   spitting tobacco wasn't banned but the � the public

23   spitting was banned because of the worry of spreading

24   disease.

25            But, you know, those were relatively minor to

1   what was to come with the introduction of the modern

2   cigarette, with Camel 1913.  You had Lucky Strike 1916.

3   Reformulation of � of other brands like Chesterfield

4   with the American blend of burley Turkish tobacco and

5   flue-cured tobacco, the bright tobacco that is heated in

6   the curing process that changed the character of the

7   smoke, making it inhalable.  And once you could get

8   rapid delivery of nicotine into the airways, you know

9   large surface areas I've described, the nicotine could

10   get to the brain in seven to ten seconds.

11             You put nicotine gum in your mouth, you're

12   talking 20 minutes to half an hour to get the nicotine

13   absorbed.  So it's not rapid reinforcement of an

14   addiction, which is what you get with cigarettes and

15   drugs.  That speed of delivery is a characteristic of

16   drugs that are highly � have a high-use liability.

17       Q    You mentioned the term inhalable or

18   inhalability.  What's different about a cigarette, the

19   modern cigarette that's been engineered as far as

20   inhalability versus a pipe or cigar?

21       A    Well, a cigar has a higher pH, same as pipe

22   tobacco.  And so the higher the pH � if it gets too

23   high, you get loads of nicotine in these products, but

24   if the pH is so high, it's harsh and almost impossible

25   to inhale unless you've been a cigarette smoker and then

1   you transfer your smoking behavior to these other

2   products.

3            But people who just smoke a cigar, they do it

4   occasionally, but they don't have to do it day in and

5   day out.  The same with pipe tobacco for the most part.

6   Whereas with cigarettes, designed the way they were with |

7   this blend, the American blend, the burley, bright

8   flue-cured tobacco and Turkish tobacco, and later the

9   addition of recon, was a highly addictive product.

10            And that's why a lot of soldiers in World War I

11   came back smoking cigarettes.  They gave up their pipes

12   and cigars and the cigarette epidemic really took off

13   from there � from there.  And then they went after

14   women in the 19 � late '20s and '30s, to recruit them

15   as a new group of smokers.  And that's why the disease

16   rates lag a little bit behind for women compared to men.

17            Actually, women have caught up to men in terms

18   of the rates � or close to men in terms of lung cancer

19   today.

2 0       Q    Okay.  So � and where you talk about these

21       factors that gave rise to the modern cigarette, I think

2 2       you hit on a couple.

2 3       A    Sure.                                                                                                f

1       A    Yeah.

2       Q    � the blending, and then we're going to talk

3   about World War I and the effect that had on America.

4             But so � but prior to then � had there been

5   references historically from, you know, people like John

6   Adams and Christopher Columbus and King James about

7   tobacco in those different forms that weren't inhalable?

8       A    Sure.  I mean, there are historical references

9   you can find.

10             I think they're contained in the 1988 Surgeon

11   General's Report.  If you look at sort of the history of

12   use of tobacco products, it covers that, with

13   Christopher Columbus talking about some of his men who

14   were at that point chewing tobacco or perhaps some of

15   then smoking it in a pipe, as they learned from the

16   Indians when they came to this country and first got

17   exposed to tobacco, reported, you know, the sort of

18   earlier references to nicotine withdrawal, similar

19   references in letters.

2 0                            I think John Adams was a cigar smoker and a

21   cigarette smoker, so . . .

22       Q    But were they talking about � when they were

23   referring to that, were they talking about the type of

24   engineered product that people used 20, 40, 60 times a

25   day like the modern cigarette?

1       A    No.  The modern cigarette is quite unique, and

2   it really tracks on to the epidemic of disease,

3   literally a man-made epidemic caused by inventing a

4   product that was addictive and engineering it and

5   perfecting its addictive potential.

6       Q    So at the beginning of the century, we had the

7   automation.  We had the ability to produce cigarettes at

8   a faster rate.

9       A    Right.

10       Q    And this new process of blending cigarettes.

11            And what is flue-curing?

12       A    Yeah.  Flue-curing was invented in the mid

13   1800s but really wasn't widely used until they started

14   to blend the bright tobacco.  They call it bright

15   tobacco because it's green, but they � when they heat

16   it, it's using heat as a way of drying out the tobacco

17   leaves, and it changes the leaves to the golden color

18   that you see in � in the tobacco.  And so that was

19   incorporated, the bright flue-cured tobacco.

20             They used to have barns, you can still see some

21   of these old barns where they used to dry out the

22   tobacco, they had a flue � you know, a fireplace on the

23   outside where they used wood, and then they'd have,

24   like, a chimney up the center of the barn, and that

25   would throw up heat.

1            And that was pretty much abandoned in the '50s.

2   They got much more sophisticated, using liquid propane

3   gas to heat up the barns.  They shut up the barns.  They

4   actually converted them actually to tin containers, like

5   almost a container that you would see on a truck, for

6   example.  And that created more heat, you know, reduced

7   the amount of time for curing which in the � in the

8   barns could take weeks and months.

9       Q    And what is one of the side effects of

10   flue-curing?  What happens as far as inhalability and

11   the ability to get the nicotine and the smoke into the

12   lungs?

13       A    Well, the flue-curing makes the smoke � it

14   changes the pH of the smoke so it makes it more

15   inhalable, sort of more palatable to inhale.  That's the

16   key ingredient.

17             One of the by-products of using a liquid

18   propane gas would be the generation of tobacco-specific

19   nitrosamines.  And flue-cured tobacco, at least in a

20   period of time, put off more of these nitrosamines,

21   which we've found were very potent lung carcinogens.

22       Q    Okay.  So what was it about � sorry.

23            What was it about World War I that really

24   heightened the � the � the use of cigarette smoking in

25   the United States for the first time on a widespread

1   basis?

2       A    Well, they had a lot of men that go over with

3   their cigars and chewing tobacco.  And, you know, they

4   didn't have airplanes they were flying them over the

5   Atlantic.  They were taken over in a ship.  And a lot of

6   that tobacco would get moldy on the long trip.

7            And so packaged in a cigarette, they, you know,

8   tended to be more portable and easily used by the

9   soldiers.

10            And nicotine will speed you up and make you

11   alert.  That's one of the effects.  It's a stimulate.

12   It also calms you down, so it has the effect of relaxing

13   you.  So if you're in war, you've got to be alert and

14   you've got to work through that time of boredom to stay

15   alert and calm you down.  So it was a perfect product.

16            And the men came back, they had been cigar and

17   chewing tobacco users, they came back as cigarette

18   smokers, and cigarette sales took off.

19            And the companies exploited this.  You saw the

20   different brands mentioned.  Lucky Strike, that was

21   introduced in 1916.  Chesterfield was reformulated from

22   a single blend to the American blend in 1918.  And those

23   three brands � Camel, Lucky Strike, and Chesterfield �

24   really dominated.  Then you saw brands like Pall Mall.

25   And every brand after that used the American blend.

5   smoking.

9   you could just explain what it means:  You said birth

10   cohort, C-O-H-O-R-T?

11       A    Yeah.  So what we do in epidemiology, part of

12   the work that I do is to look at how different groups in

13   the population have been affected to different

14   information environments.  The information environments

21   smoking prevalence rates were in that group, what the

11       Q    So this chart, the yellow line, what does that

12   represent as far � the bottom is the years, correct?

13       A    That's right.

14       Q    Okay.  Does this reflect what we've been

15   talking about, the cigarette century and the rise of the

16   modern cigarette?

17       A    Right.  On the left axis is millions of

18   cigarettes sold in the United States, and this is

19   looking at sales.  And you can see the � you know, it

20   basically peaked in the early 1980s.  1981 is when

21   cigarette consumption � even though prevalence began to |

22   drop a little bit before that time, because of the baby

23   boom generation, there were just more people around to

1            And you can look at this pattern and compare

2   that to the patterns of disease rates in the population

3   like lung cancer and COPD and you see a very strong

4   correlation.

5       Q    Okay.  And we're going to talk more about that.

6   But just if we � and since you mentioned it, if we

7   compare what happened to this lung cancer which was an

8   almost unheard of disease, as you've said.

9       A    Right.

10       Q    As we compare what happened to lung disease in

11   this century, this last century, did it � did it � did

12   it track this number?

13       A    It did.  What you find is a lag of about 10 to

14   15 years.  So you can see the red line there being the

15   male lung cancer deaths.  And so, you know, you have to

16   wait about 10, 15 years before, you know, of exposure.

17   So you have to have enough exposure to create the cancer

18   and � and then � and then that began the epidemic of

19   lung cancer that we saw in this country, which in males,

20   you know, peaked out in the mid '90 and follows a

21   downward trend.  It's lagging the decline in cigarette

22   consumption.

23       Q    Okay.  So we've talked about John Price's

24   cohort in the time when he was growing up.  How was �

1   society at the time.

2             How was the cigarette being portrayed in

3   society through movies, through advertisements, and

4   those types of things back in the 1940s going into the

5   1950s when Mr. Price was growing up?

6       A    Fun to do.  Everybody is doing it.  Athletes

7   are doing it.  Movie stars were doing it.  And there was

8   a lot of comarketing with movies and movie stars back in |

9   the '30s and '40s.  There were radio shows, which was

10   the predominant form of entertainment before television.

11   You'd have, you know, your baseball teams and so on

12   sponsored by cigarette companies � the Lucky Strike Hit

13   Parade on the radio � and so on.  Later on television.

14       Q    Are there a lot of examples in movies of

15   cigarettes?

16       A    Yes, tons.  Early on and then later you see

17   product placements in movies where they were paid to put

18   the placements, see comarketing of cigarette brands by

19   certain actors and actresses back in the '40s.

2 0       Q    Okay.  And have you brought a couple of

21       examples from the '40s when John was growing up? 2 2       A    Yes.                                                                                                  f

1       A    Many, yeah.

2       Q    Okay.  Let me ask you:  How about not just in

3   the movies but in the public environment in general, are

4   there examples of how prevalent � strike that.  It's

5   still leading.

6            Let me ask you this:  Were � were they

7   prevalent in the United States on billboards and

8   advertisements all around, where everyone including

9   young people like John Price, could see?

10       A    Yes.  They were in newspapers, magazines,

11   point-of-sale, billboards.  They were a part of taxis

12   and buses.  Transit ads were very popular for

13   cigarettes.

15   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

16       Q    And what is this we're looking at?

17       A    This is the giant ad in Times Square in

18   New York City for Camel cigarettes where they had

19   arranged to have smoke rings blowing out of the Camel.

20   There's a similar one in Chicago as well.

21       Q    Okay.  Now let's talk about some other examples

22   back then.

23            First of all, was it unusual for doctors and

24   nurses and other health care professionals to be smoking

25   back in this time?

1       A    No.  I mean, as I pointed out, in the early

2    '50s, you had 58 percent of men smoking, over half of

3   doctors smoked at that time.  It was common for doctors

4   to go to their medical meetings, and they'd have a booth

5   there, you know, passing out free samples of cigarettes

6   to doctors.

7             They used doctors and nurses and dentists and

8   pharmacists in advertising different brands of

9   cigarettes.  This was very common, particularly in �

10   well, back in the '30s, '40s, and into the '50s:

11            More doctors smoke our brand.

12             You saw that from an ad in the '30s for Lucky

13   Strike.

14             Camel had a series of ads in the '40s:

15            More doctors smoke Camel than any other brand.

19       Q    Is this � are these the only ads with examples

20   of doctors and nurses smoking cigarettes?

21       A    No.  There are many.  Literally boatloads of

22   these documents � or of these ads.  You can see these

23   are colored ads.  And a lot of the advertising in

24   magazines in the day were black and white, but the

25   cigarette ads often in the big magazines like Saturday

1   Evening Post and so on were of this type where they were

2   in color.

3       Q    So we've got:

4             I'm going to grow to a hundred years old.

5            More doctors smoke Camels than any other

6   cigarette.

7             How big was that advertising campaign?

8       A    It was � it was big and highly successful

9   according to the Reynolds internal business records.

10   The theme of marketing that doctors used their brands

11   was reassuring.  This is a campaign they ran in the late

12   1940s and into the early 1950s, so just as a lot of the

13   evidence was first coming out indicating cigarette

14   smoking was the cause of disease.

15       Q    And are there other examples of advertisements

16   portraying smoking as healthy, fun � well, healthy and

17   fun things to do like that?

18       A    Sure.  I mean, Pall Mall had, you know, their

19   campaign because Pall Mall was the longer unfiltered

20   cigarette, so they talked about the extra mildness you

21   get with Pall Mall because it's � it's filtered

22   naturally through the tobacco.  That was one of their

23   themes.

24            And then they talked about the fun of smoking.

25   That was one of the themes for Pall Mall in the late

9
	these ads to the T-zone.  Tell me what the T-zone was.

10
	A    Well, you know the T was for your throat, easy ;

11
	on your throat and good taste, so that was the � the

12
	theme.  And they were challenging people to take the

13
	30-day challenge, which was to turn in their pack and

14
	try Camels for 30 days.  And they were, you know,

15
	basically using that as a way to try to capture a share

1   and things like that?

2       A    Well, we see the introduction of television in

3   the early '50s, and the growth of television.  So you

4   went from � I think one of the documents, the FTC

5   documents, said only 9 percent of households had

6   television in 1950, but that changed rapidly in the

7   decade, where virtually everybody had a television.  And

8   that became the predominant way that cigarettes were

9   marketed, although they didn't stop marketing in the

10   other venues.  But they did, you know, spend a large

11   share of their � their advertising dollars on

12   television.

13       Q    And cigarette advertising, is it allowed on

14   television today?

15       A    No.  Cigarette advertising was banned �

16       Q    Okay.

17       A    � from television.

18       Q    But back � I'm sorry.

19            But back then, how prevalent was it, was

20   cigarette advertising?

21       A    Well, there was three channels, and they

22   sponsored 80 of the shows, so virtually every show on

23   television.  Most of the shows on TV had advertising for

24   cigarettes going on, and many of the shows themselves

25   had their stars of their show pitching the brands.  It

6   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

7       Q    Was Camel the first � the first hugely

8   successful brand coming into the '30s and '40s?

9       A    Yes.  Camel was, you know, one of the most

10   popular brands.  It was really Camel, Lucky Strike.

11   Those were the top selling brands.  By the early '40s,

12   Pall Mall was beginning to pick up its share of young

13   people and became the top-selling unfiltered cigarette

14   in the 19 � in the 1950s.

15       Q    And then we've talked about some of the other

16   brands, so I don't want to go back into that.

2   with her prom ticket, the cheerleader for Camels.

3             You know, and then reinforcing the notion that

4   it was easy on your throat, so less throat scratch with

5   Pall Mall.  Guard against the throat scratch because of

6   the extra mildness you get with the extra length of a

7   Pall Mall cigarette where the smoke is filtered

2       taste of fine, mellow tobacco.  And your food will

3       taste better too.

4             But why do these wonderful things happen when I

5       change to Philip Morris?

6            Because you'll be smoking the one cigarette

7       with a difference in manufacture, an important

8       difference that avoids a common cause of cigarette

9       irritation.

10             Day after day you'll be smoking these

11       cigarettes recommended by eminent nose and throat

12        specialists to patients who smoke.  The one

13       cigarette proved definitely milder than any other

14        leading brand.

15            Whether you've been smoking for ten months or

16       ten years, something wonderful happens.  You'll feel

17       better when you change to Philip Morris.

18             So remember:  Next time you buy cigarettes, be

19       sure you call for Philip Morris and feel something 2 0                wonderful happen to you.

3            Do you inhale?  Then you're better off smoking

4       Philip Morris.  And here's how you can prove it.

5             Light up a Philip Morris, take a puff, get a

6       good mouthful of smoke, and slowly let the smoke

7        come directly through your nose.

8            Now light up your present brand and do exactly

9       the same thing.  Take a puff, get a good mouthful of

10        smoke, and slowly let the smoke come directly

11       through your nose.

12             Notice any difference?

13             Yes.  The Philip Morris is so mild while my own

14       brand seems sort of harsh and burning.

15             That's irritation.  And remember, the

16       irritation you felt in your nose is the same

17        irritation that occurs in your throat every time you

18       inhale your own brand.

19             So for a more enjoyable smoke than you've ever

20       known before, smoke Philip Morris, the one cigarette

21       proved definitely less irritating, definitely milder

22       than any other leading brand.

23            Do you inhale?  Then you certainly should . . .

24             Call for Philip Morris.

25            America's finest cigarette.

2   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

3       Q    Okay.  So we've already talked about � we've

4   talked about inhale � inhalability in that commercial.

5            And that was a Philip Morris commercial by the

6   way, right?

7       A    That's correct.

8       Q    Okay.  But the � I compare that � I won't ask |

9   you about that � and the T-zone that was the

10   R. J. Reynolds one.

11            Was this a focus of the companies at the time,

12   including R. J. Reynolds, talking about its milder on

13   you � to consumers, it's milder on your throat, it's

14   milder in your mouth, these types of things?

15       A    Yes.  It addresses the one problem of smoking,

16   which is irritation.  So when you ask people questions

17   about the harm of smoking, they tell you back in this

18   day it's irritation.  That was the harm from smoking,

19   and they have brands that will solve that problem.

20   Camel was one of them that promoted itself as mild, or

21   Pall Mall �                                                                                                    j 2 2       Q    Okay.                                                                                                f

1            MR. PRYSOCK:  Sure.

2   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

3       Q    Dr. Cummings, what's the year of this ad?  Or

4   when was this advertising?

5       A    I believe this one is somewhere in the 194 6 to

6   1948 period.  It ran � you saw Johnny Roventini, the

7   little Philip Morris guy, call for Philip Morris.  He

8   appeared in movie theatres.  So this would be something

9   you would see in advance of the movie as an ad.  Like we

10   see products today for sodas and so on, they used to

11   have cigarette ads that ran the little clips before the

12   movie ran.

13       Q    And Mr. Price would have been approximately

14   eight to ten years old at that time � or I'm sorry �

15   10 to 12 years old at that time?

16       A    Correct.

17       Q    And you mentioned Johnny Roventini the � the

18   little gentleman, the bellhop:  Call for Philip Morris?

19       A    Yeah.                                                                                                f 2 0       Q    How popular � have you seen documents where

21   the tobacco industry is discussing how popular Johnny

22   Roventini was with young kids?

23       A    Very popular.  He would attract audiences who

24   would come.  They even had suggested he hand out treats

25   to the children and so on, including candy � I think

2       Q    Okay.  And we're talking about things in these

3   advertising � how � how does � how do these

4   advertisements � and we're going to look at one or two

5   more, but how do these advertisements from

6   R. J. Reynolds and from the other manufacturers � why

7   are these important to show as far as understanding back |

8   then social acceptability of smoking when John Price as

9   a young boy made the decision to start smoking?

10       A    Well, they help provide the information

11   environment.  And, you know, these were ads that were

12   appearing everywhere.  You can hardly avoid them.  It

13   made smoking appear as a normal lifestyle decision, a

14   socially acceptable behavior, not, you know, an

15   addictive behavior that would end up killing one out of

16   two of the long-term users.  This was not � this is

17    just, you know, making smoking appear normal.

18            And you could smoke anywhere.  You could smoke,

19   you know, in public buildings, in courthouses, in � on

20   airplanes, on trains and buses and the supermarket.

21   There were no restrictions on smoking back in the day.

11       Q    And was it � we've talked about this before.

12   I don't want to get back into it.  But was Pall Mall a

13   very heavily advised product as confirmed by their own

14   internal documents that was successful in getting people

15   for choose that brand?

16            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, leading.  It's

17       argumentative.  There's so much in that question

2   had been Lucky, but Lucky was declining and Pall Mall

4       Q    Did the � did the cigarette makers, including

5   R. J. Reynolds, use athletes and movie stars to promote

7       A    Yes, they did.

8       Q    At a time when Mr. Price was growing up?

9       A    Yeah.  Baseball players, football players, all

10   athletes � all different athletes.

11       Q    What's the significance of athletes, you know,

12   as far as social acceptability, showing athletes smoking |

13   cigarettes?

14       A    Well, they're role models.  Like it or not they |

15   are role models for young people, particularly young

16   boys.  And so � and they also, even for young men, give

17   the impression that if, you know, this professional

2   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

3       Q    And in that one � we see different ones, but

4   that was one Philip Morris, correct?

5       A    That's correct.

6       Q    What does that have to do with the information

7   environment in which John Price was growing up and

8   becoming an adult in?

9       A    If he's watching television, this is the kind

10   of thing he's going to see on TV, that it's normal,

11   acceptable to smoke.  That here are these stars, they

12   smoke.  Athletes are smoking.  Doctors are smoking.

13   Nothing wrong with it.

14       Q    We talked a little bit before about Winstons,

15   and you said Winston was � how successful � or how

16   heavily advertised were Winston cigarettes?

17       A    Well, they were � they became the most heavily

18   advertised brand.  They quickly replaced Camel as their

19   top-selling brand introduced in 1954.

20            And they really took advantage of television

21   marketing to market Winston cigarettes as a good-tasting

22   filtered cigarette.  Winston takes good like a cigarette

23   should was their jingle.

24             They talked about the � the new blend, the

25   filter blend, and the pure white filter on Winston.  And

2    "Flintstones" in the early '60s.  Later "The Beverly

3   Hillbillies" were sponsored by R. J. Reynolds and

4   Winston cigarettes.

5       Q    Was Winston a brand that Mr. Price switched to

6   once filters came out?

7       A    Yes.

10       Q    What year did Winstons come out?

11            MR. WALKER:  May I have a ruling?

12            MR. PRYSOCK:  I'll lay a foundation.  I'm

15   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

16       Q    What year did Winstons come out again?

17       A    1954.

18       Q    Okay.  Had Mr. Price been smoking before that

19   time?

20       A    Yes.

24       speaking objection, Your Honor.

11            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I took this witness's

13       and was not provided in terms of reliance materials

14        for this case, and I also asked him if he had any

15       opinions that were specific to Mr. Price.

16             I was told he had no opinions that were

17        specific to Mr. Price, which would include opinions

18       about when he smoked and when he started and so

19       forth.

2 0                           That was represented to me by counsel on the

21       phone, and I was told that he was only provided a

22        limited set of materials, which did not include his

23       interrogatories, did not include his deposition, and |

1       didn't have, the e-mail information which he was

2       given, and the deposition which he was not given.

3             So he � all of these questions about when did

4       he smoke Winston, that information was not provided

5       to him.  It was not even available.

6            MR. PRYSOCK:  Just a couple things, Your Honor. |

7             First of all � and I have the transcript over

8       here of the deposition, exactly where we

9       disclosed � Mr. Walker asked me what is he going to f

10       testify about, and I told him in the deposition.

11        I'll be happy to show that to the Court because I

12       have it out already.

13            But the other portion of this, Your Honor:  I

14       didn't think there was any dispute that he started

15       smoking at the age of 12.  It's in � it's coming in |

16       in the deposition testimony.  It's been designated.

17        It's all coming in that he started smoking at the

18       age of 10 to 12.

19             I frankly � I had no idea they were going to

20       dispute this.  That's okay if they do, but it is not

21       in dispute, which would mean he started smoking in 2 2                 19 � around 1948.

2 3                           THE COURT:  Yeah.  And I � by the way, I've

Page 1322 is if you assume he started smoking � I mean, it's

just common sense, if Winston didn't come out until

1954 and he started smoking around 1948 or 1950, he

had to switch to Winston to smoke Winston.

MR. WALKER:  Your Honor.

MR. PRYSOCK:  I mean . . .

MR. WALKER:  The fallacy of that is obvious. The suggestion that he smoked as soon as they came out in 1954 � he couldn't have smoked them before then, I agree.  But multiple times he has asked and implied, and it was said in opening, that he switched to Winston cigarettes when they came out. And he told the jury it was 1954.

This witness has no � the only information he has about Mr. Price at all �

THE COURT:  Okay.  But what is it � now, I've got � I've got all the history.  What is it you don't want to happen?

MR. WALKER:  He shouldn't be asked any questions about �

THE COURT:  Because you started off on your objection having to do with opinion.

MR. WALKER:  It's foundation.  He should not be asked questions about Mr. Price's smoking history because he has no foundation for any of them.  The

Mr. Price switch to Winstons filtered cigarettes?

MR. WALKER:  He doesn't have any foundation to answer that question.  The only information he has �

I mean, you can do it that way.  I mean, I don't � as long as it's going to be �

MR. WALKER:  But there's not going to be any basis in the record for him to just �

MR. PRYSOCK:  Correct.

MR. WALKER:  Even after his deposition is read, this witness was not supposed to give any testimony about Mr. Price other than in the form of a hypothetical.  That was what I understood from the deposition.

MR. PRYSOCK:  For the brands he smoked.

4            What year did Winstons come out?

5       A    1954.                                                                                                |

7   is that right?

8       A    Yes, it was.

9       Q    If you assumed that Mr. Price, doing the math,

10   started smoking at age 10 to 12, could he have smoked

11   Winstons before they came out and started being

14       Q    If you make that assumption that he began

15   smoking � started smoking at age 10 to 12, would

16   Mr. Price have had to have switched to filtered Winstons

17   at some later point, 1954 or later?

1       A    The year they started, you know, selling the

2   product, which was 1954, and it became their top seller.

3   And they spent most of their advertising dollars on

4   Winston.

5       Q    Over what time period did they spend that money

6   advertising?

7       A    It was their flagship brand for the next two

17       A    Well, that was a loud show.

18             "The Beverly Hillbillies" was a comedy showed

19   that aired in prime time in 1963.  It become the top

20   viewed television show on � on TV.  I think it started

21   in '63 and then continued to be the most popular show on |

2   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

3       Q    And, Dr. Cummings, what were the

4    "Flintstones" � what time did that show air, first of

5   all?

6       A    It �

7       Q    When it first came out?

8       A    I think it was 1960 and '61 is when it � it

9   first aired in 1960, I believe.  It was a prime time

10   show, sort of modeled after the adult "Honeymooners"

11   show, with Fred and Barney.

12            And so it, you know, premiered right after

13   "Matty's Funnies", so there were two cartoon shows that

14   appeared, and I think this is from the New York Times.

15             It eventually aired at 7:30 in the evening.

16       Q    And what was the lead in to the "Flintstones"?

17       A    "Matty's" Funny � "Funday Funnies."

18       Q    With "Caspar the Ghost" and �

19       A    Yeah, "Caspar the Ghost."

2 0       Q    Okay.  All right.  Let's look at the

21   "Flintstones" at PT570.

22             (A video clip was played and transcribed by the

23   court reporter to the best of her ability as follows:)

24             They sure work hard, don't they, Barney?

25             Yeah.  I hate to see them work so hard.

1             Yeah, me too.

2             Let's go around back where we can't see them.

3             Gee, we ought to do something, Fred.

4             Okay.  How's about taking a nap?

5             Hey, I got a better idea.  Let's take a Winston

6       break.

7             That's it.

8            Winston is the one filtered cigarette that

9       deliveries flavor 20 times a pack.  Winston's got

10       that filter blend.

11             Yeah, Fred.  Filter blend makes the big taste

12       of Winston, and only Winston has it up front where

13       it counts.

14             Here.  They added a pure white filter.  Winston

15       packs rich tobacco specially selected and specially

16       processed for good flavor in filtered smoke.

17             Yeah, Barney.  Winston tastes good like a

18       cigarette should.

19             "The Flintstones" have been brought to you by

20       Winston, America's best-selling, best-tasting

21        filtered cigarette.

22            Winstons taste good like a cigarette should.

1   did they � were they required � did they take the �

2   this portion of the advertising off?

3       A    Yeah, when it went to a Saturday morning

4   syndicated cartoon show, which was a few years later,

5   they took off the Winston sponsorship as well as � I

6   think Alka-Seltzer was the other company that was

1             (Sidebar was concluded and the following

2   further proceedings were held:)

3   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

4       Q    Dr. Cummings, we talked about the lead-in to �

5   to the "Flintstones" when it was at night, and the

6   "Casper" show and the other show.  Were �

7             Have you seen demographics as to whether not

8   just adults watching the "Flintstones" but were

9   teenagers also watching the "Flintstones" when it came

10   out at night when it was being advertised?

11       A    Yeah, teenagers and young children.  It was a

12   popular family activity.  And the data from, you know,

13   TV marketers, ABC in this case, they kept track of who

14   was watching the show and would sell that to

15   advertisers.

16       Q    Okay.  I'd like to move to another area now.

17   We're talking about during this time frame of John

18   Price's life and something else that happened that was a

19   significant time period as far as the conspiracy goes.

20            MR. PRYSOCK:  The � if we can pull up the

21       consumption chart again.  You need the number?

23       Q    Okay.  We've got the total cigarette

24   consumption chart that we saw earlier, and I'd like to

1   the � as it goes up, there's a major dip � if I can

2   come over here � there's a major dip right here in the

3   early 1950s � 1953; is that correct?

4       A    That's right.

5            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor; leading and

6       it's argumentative by inclusion of the world major.

7            MR. PRYSOCK:  I'll rephrase.

8             THE COURT:  Okay.

9   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

10       Q    As far as cigarette sales and consumption in

11   the United States, what happened in 1953?

12       A    Sales went down for the first time since the

13   Great Depression.

14       Q    And is that � where is the Great Depression

15   marked here?

16       A    That's reflected by the little dip between the

17   1930s and 1940s.

18       Q    Okay.  And then from that time � from the

19   1930s � and we've gone through the rise of cigarettes

20   earlier in the century, but from that time, the 1930s to

21   the early 1950s, how exponential � or what was the

22   growth like of cigarettes in the United States?

23       A    Every year the sales were better than the prior

24   year until 1953, when sales dropped for the first time.

25   And that was perceived as a crisis by the industry,

1   which precipitated their meeting at the Plaza Hotel.

2       Q    What was it that happened in 1953 � or what

3   study had just � or what studies had just come out at

4   the end of 1952 and 1953 that reflected this drop in

5   sales?

6       A    Well, there had been a few studies that had

7   come out in the 1950s.  And then in 1953, an important

8   study was published in this country in cancer research

9   where they had taken tar extracted from cigarettes,

10   exposed it onto the shaved skin of a mouse, and produced

11   cancerous tumors on the skin of the mouse that begin to

12   connect the dots between this rapid rise in lung cancer,

13   that correlated with cigarette use, some of the human

14   studies that had previously shown that people who smoked

15   were more likely to get lung cancer.  And so these

16   pictures of these mice with cancerous tumors that were

17   dose dependent � the more tar, the more tumors, the

18   bigger the tumors.

19            And that particular study in the scientific

20   Journal of Cancer Research in June of 1953 got picked up

21   in the popular press, a number of news press at the

22   time.  And then they did a spread in Life Magazine in

23   December of 1953.

24            And of course these studies were also getting

25   reported in medical meetings and getting covered by the

1   press as well.

2       Q    Okay.  And one thing that � okay.

3            Did that study receive a lot of publicity?  Or

4   did it make magazines and thing like that?

5       A    Yeah.  Life Magazine, and I think some of the

6   other magazines also picked it up as well.

7            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  And let's show the Life

8       Magazine, PT3013.

9   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

10       Q    And it's December 21st, 1953; is that correct?

11       A    That's right.

12       Q    Smoke gets in the news.

13            And is this the study � who is that on the

14   left, the gentleman in the lab coat there?

15       A    That's Dr. Graham.  This is the Wynder, Graham,

16   and Croninger study.  Dr. Croninger there in the lower

17   left part holding the beakers of tar that's been

18   extracted from the tobacco.  She did most of the

19   experimental work painting them onto the animals.

20   Dr. Wynder was the lead author on the paper.

21            And so this was an important study in this

22   country.  There actually had been many mouse-painting

23   experiments that had been done prior to that, but most

24   of them had been published in scientific journals

25   overseas, often in different languages.

1             But there was a cumulation of evidence coming

2   that smoking was the cause of cancer, and now they had

3   shown that there's something in the tar that was causing |

4   the tumors.

5       Q    What happened to tobacco cigarette companies'

6   stocks?                                                                                                               |

7       A    Once this information got reported in various

8   medical meetings, the stocks fell, and certainly

9   reflecting a decline in cigarette consumption that

10   occurred.

11            And that was � that was what precipitated the

12   meeting at the Plaza Hotel of the presidents of the

13   major cigarette companies.  That happened in early

14   December.

15       Q    Okay.                                                                                                f

16       A    In fact, on the same date of this news release

17   talking about the stock market fall.

18       Q    And this is the New York Times; is that

19   correct?  Just an article showing a reporting of the

20   tobacco stocks hit by cancer reports?

21       A    That's right.  And this was December 10th.

22   That was the day the telegram went out by Paul Hahn to

23   his cohorts in the other cigarette companies to have a

24   meeting at the Plaza Hotel.

25             That meeting took place on December 14th, where

1   they decided to hire Hill & Knowlton.  And then that's

2   how some of these affiliated organizations got created.

3   The Tobacco Industry Research Committee grew out of that

4   meeting, and then later the Tobacco Institute.

5       Q    Okay.  Let's show, if we can, PT3608.

6             This is all � this is February 1953, correct?

7       A    Right.  This is by Claude Teague.  He had

8   joined Reynolds in 1951 as a chemist.  And, you know,

9   they were � their research and development program was

10   a little smaller at that point, but he was the head of

11   their chemistry unit at the time.

12            And he was asked to prepare a report on the

13   relationship between cigarette smoking and cancer.  And

14   this is a literature review that he prepared and shared

15   with top executives at R. J. Reynolds.

16       Q    So the scientist � who did he share it with?

17       A    Well, I know it was shared with the law

18   department, and actually Henry Ramm, who was chief

19   general counsel at Reynolds, who said it was not to be

20   distributed.

21       Q    Okay.  And let's look at Dr. Teague's report.

22            And Dr. Teague references the bibliography,

23   scientific research that had been done before that time

24   by others, correct?

25       A    That's right.  He cites that in, you know,

1   something like 70 � 70 to 80 articles are cited in the

2   public literature, some of them in foreign language.

3   But he had pulled together this information, and in

4   three different areas:  Chemistry, so what was known

5   about the chemistry of carcinogens and specifically

6   carcinogens identified in tobacco smoke, which was, in

7   the early '50s, something that was just evolving because

8   the technology to isolate these chemicals was just

9   evolving.

10             He talked about the animal studies and had a

11   very detailed study of the animal studies.  About 30 of

12   those studies were summarized in the review.

13            And then the human clinical studies, which were

14   the studies of cancer patients versus controls, people

15   without cancer, where they asked them about their

16   smoking habits, and where they found several of these

17   studies were showing that almost all the lung cancer was

18   occurring in people who were heavy smokers.

19       Q    Okay.  And you said it was a survey of

20   literature, and let's compare now to back then.

21            Nowadays is it easy to access medical

22   literature from other facilities, other countries and

23   things where you see studies of different health topics?

24       A    Yes.  It's quite amazing what we can do today.

25   Even when I started it was a lot different, but today

1   you can go on the Internet.  All the published

2   literature is in various public libraries which are

3   online.  If they're in foreign language, you can do

4   translations.

5        Q    How does that relate to back then even for

6   scientists as far as trying to find other, you know,

7   survey of the literature and everything, interpreting

8   from other languages and things like that?

9       A    Very different.  You would have to go to the

10   library, hope that the relevant scientific publications

11   were in the library, find them on the shelf, take them

12   out, read them, and so on.  And so very different.

13             Of course, this was � really dates the

14   beginning of R. J. Reynolds creating a massive medical

15   library of the research on smoking and health, which

16   they did create, and actually that was maintained as

17   part of the conspiracy.  They had their -- they called

18   it the legal library.

19       Q    And let's look at Dr. Teague's conclusions.

20             And by the way, was this an internal document?

21       A    Yes, this is internal.  In fact, Henry Ramm

22   very explicitly told Dr. Teague not to distribute this 2 3        document.

24        Q    Okay.

1   smoking has led to the suspicion that tobacco smoking is

2   an important etiologic factor in the induction of

3   primary cancer of the lung.  Studies of clinical data

4   tend to confirm the relationship between heavy and

5   prolonged tobacco smoking and incidence of cancer of the

6   lung.

7             Extensive though inconclusive testing of the

8   tobacco substances on animals indicate the probable

9   presence of carcinogenic agents in those substances.

10            What are carcin � what does carcinogenic mean?

11       A    Cancer causing.

12       Q    And what does � it talked about etiologic

13   factor.  What is an etiologic factor?

14       A    Etiologic.

15       Q    Sorry.

16       A    It's a cause.

17       Q    Okay.

18       A    A causal factor.  An important causal factor in

19   the induction or cause of lung cancer.

20       Q    Okay.  And how many months was this before that

21   meeting at the Plaza Hotel?

22       A    Well, this was in February, so the meeting at

23   the Plaza Hotel was ten months later, in early December.

24   December 14th is when the actual first meeting of the

25   executives occurred, and then they met repeatedly in the

1   month of December as they hatched the conspiracy.

2       Q    Okay.  And let's talk about that meeting.

3            First of all, was it common back then for the

4   heads of the major cigarette companies in the United

5   States to meet like this?

6       A    No.

7       Q    Why not?

8       A    Well, I mean, they were competitors.  So

9   this � there was concern that this was an antitrust

10   violation.  In fact, they were so concerned, they did

11   contact the Department of Justice to let them know that

12   they were meeting.

13             In fact, it got out in early January that they

14   had been meeting at the Plaza Hotel.  And so they

15   communicated the fact that they had met and sent their

16   articles of incorporation for the newly formed

17   organization, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee,

18   to the Department of Justice, Judge Stanley Barnes, who

19   was the Assistant Attorney General of the United States.

20       Q    And that was � was that because of concerns

21   that would be raised about antitrust issues?

22       A    Yeah, because they had been in trouble before

23   on antitrust issues, price fixing.  Had � there had

24   been a charge brought.

9   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

10       Q    And so � but did they disclose what they

11   discussed at this meeting and the plan that was � that

12   came out of the meeting as far as their actions united

13   together and in what they did over the next 4 0-something |

14   years?                                                                                                                 |

15       A    Well, they disclosed the articles of

16   incorporate and the limits of what the organization was

17   to do.  They said the organization was to restrict

18   itself, its power, to the study of diseases,

19   particularly lung cancer related to cigarette smoking,

20   to confirm or refute that, and to share factual

21   information as a result of those studies.  And so that

22   was the limits of what they told the Department of 2 3        Justice.

2 4                           Now, when you go back and follow what they

25       actually did over the next 45 years, they did not limit

2   misleading information to the American public on what

3   they knew about the risks of smoking, the addictiveness

4   of their products.  And � and they concealed how they

10       asked.

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir, Your Honor.

12   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

13       Q    So we've seen February 1953 we had Dr. Teague's

14   conclusions.

15       A    Right.

16       Q    We've seen the Wynder studies come out in Life

17   Magazine towards the end � towards the end of the year.

18   And then we have this meeting by the tobacco companies,

19   what they're going to do as a result of what's been

20   happening publicly at the very end of the year, right?

21       A    That's right.

22       Q    Okay.  As a result of that meeting, did

23   R. J. Reynolds and the other manufacturers come out and

24   say, We agree there is proof that smoking causes lung

25   cancer or there's an indication that smoking causes lung f

1   cancer?

2       A    No.  They said there is no proof even though

3   Reynolds certainly knew there was some proof because

4   their own scientist had concluded there was some proof

5   that cigarette smoking was the cause of lung cancer.

6   But in their public statement, they said there's no

7   proof that cigarette smoking caused the � any harm to

8   human health.

9       Q    Okay.  And we looked at this document before,

10   but I just want to look � we looked at it briefly

11   before, the forwarding memorandum which came as a result

12   of this meeting at the Plaza Hotel, correct?

13       A    Okay.                                                                                                I

14       Q    And it's PT2 0 61.

15            And now just to put this in context � I read

16   the whole thing before when we were talking about

17   addiction, but as far as the health effects:

18             Boy, wouldn't it � boy, wouldn't it be

19   wonderful if our company was the first to produce a

20   cancer-free cigarette.

21            And that was a statement of � of who?

22       A    That's one of the research directors of the

23   manufacturers of cigarettes that participated in this

24   meeting.  They interviewed four of them.

25       Q    I think I probably wasn't clear before, and I

1   apologize.

2             This document right here, was this a public

3   document, these statements, or what was this?

4       A    This was an internal document to Hill &

5   Knowlton and to the planning committee.  So the planning

6   committee was the executives that Hill & Knowlton, the

7   public relations firm, and the executives from the

8   cigarette companies that planned out the response, which

9   began with The Frank Statement to smokers, which was a

10   newspaper ad that they ran in early January.

11       Q    Okay.  So going on in the forwarding

12   memorandum �

13            And is this the first documentation internally

14   where they lay out what the plan is going to be going

15   forward for the next however many decades?

16       A    Yes.  It's really the � I mean, there are some

17   minutes that talk about a pro cigarette response to this

18   information coming out against smoking, but they really

19   articulate what the goal is, which is to reassure

20   smokers that it was okay to keep smoking.

21       Q    But naturally that is something almost too

22   terrible � Oh.  This is the way the worlds end � I'm

23   sorry.  At the top � this is the way the world ends,

24   not in a bang but a whimper.  But naturally there is

1   men to realize even yet, though the very heads of the

2   great corporations themselves signalize the end of the

3   old days when they linked arms and walked together to

4   consult with us.

5             The heads of the great corporations.  Which

6   heads of the great corporations?

7       A    Those are the presidents of the major

8   manufacturers including R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris,

9   Brown & Williamson, American Tobacco.

10        Q    And when they linked arms and walked together,

11   it says to consult with us.  Who's us?

12       A    They're talking about Hill & Knowlton, the

13   public relations firm in New York City.

14        Q    Okay.  How big was Hill & Knowlton as far as a

15   public relations firm back then when they hired them?

16       A    Sure.  They were one of the best-known public

17   relations firms in the United States representing major

18   corporations, and they were hired by the cigarette

19   companies.

20        Q    Continuing on:

21             There is only one problem:  Confidence and how

22   to establish it, public assurance and how to create it,

23   in a perhaps long interim when scientific doubts must

24   remain.  And most important, how to free millions of

25   Americans from the guilty fear that is going to arise

1   deep to their biological depths regardless of any

2   pooh-poohing logic every time they light a cigarette.

3            And what are they talking about there,

4   Dr. Cummings?

5       A    You know, as smokers were getting exposed �

6   the consumers in general were getting exposed to this

7   information that there might be something wrong with

8   smoking, they wanted to reassure them that it was okay

9   to smoke.  And they hatched a plan, and they executed

10   that plan over 45 years to constantly reassure smokers

11   that it was okay to smoke.

12       Q    Okay.  One more from this.

13            And you mentioned before this is kind of where

14   they laid it out.  Did they follow this blueprint over

15   the next 40-something years?

16       A    They did.  And they talked about it at various

17   points in time, late 50s into the early '70s and then

18   later, about how it had been brilliantly conceived and

19   executed, not as a strategy for victory but to keep them

20   going, to create doubt in the public's mind.  So there

21   was a controversy.  So if you're an addicted smoker, you

22   need an excuse to keep lighting up.

23       Q    Was this a small-scale project where not a lot

24   of money was spent?

25       A    No.  This was a major endeavor.  As I said, it

1   went over 40 � 45 years, and they spent well over a

2   billion dollars to fund the research operation, most of

3   which had nothing to do with smoking and health, and

4   their public relations efforts through the Tobacco

5   Institute.  In fact, when they created the Tobacco

6   Institute, the funding for that went up ten times the

7   level of research funding that they had announced that

8   they were going to do in the early '50s.

9       Q    Okay.  Let's keep going with this memo.

10             The fact is, of course, that no one who has

11   been a heavy smoker is going to benefit himself now by

12   falling into a panic and eliminating the pleasure and

13   comfort of cigarettes.  He might as well just go on

14   enjoying his smoke in the interim, while research

15   pursues the facts, with full assurance that if any

16   cancer-causing agent is ever really found in tobacco,

17   the manufacturers will quickly find a way to eliminate

18   it.

19             Did they in fact carry out that plan?  And are

20   we going to show examples of how they attempted to

21   reassure smokers that nothing had been found yet?

22             THE COURT:  Rephrase your question.  That was 2 3       compound.

Page 1350 Q    Okay.  Dr. Cummings, first of all, did I read

that right?

A    You did.

Q    Okay.  Secondly, did they in fact carry out this plan to reassure smokers over the next several decades?

A    Yes, they did carry it out.

THE COURT:  Is this the same document? MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir. BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q    Is this the same document, Dr. Cummings?

A    Yes, it is.

Q    Okay.

So let the scientists do the worrying for us. That's their business.  And, meanwhile, let us go on eating and working and playing and smoking and relaxing and riding in automobiles and living a good life every

8   day.

You can count on the cigarette companies, who have obligated themselves to pour millions of dollars into cancer research, to take anything out of your cigarette that is a health hazard if our science ever really finds any such hazard in the wonderful tobacco leaf.

Did they execute that part of plan?

1       A    Yes.  They frequently went and gave public

2   statements:  If there's anything harmful found in

3   cigarettes, we can remove it.  But we haven't found

4   anything harmful yet.

5             And that was a constant thing that you see

6   stated from the '50s into the '60s into the '70s to

7   reassure smokers that it was okay to keep smoking

8   cigarettes.

9       Q    And what effect did that have on social

10   acceptability as far as continuing to smoke when this

11   counter message was going out from what public health

12   was trying to say?                                                                                      j

13       A    It maintained social acceptance of smoking and j

14   made it acceptable to smoke because it hadn't been

15   proven that anything was harmful.  And so that was the

16   purpose is to, you know, reestablish and maintain the

17   social acceptance.  Because once they lost that social

18   acceptance, smoking rates would decline -- as they have

19   since 2 0 00.

20        Q    What effect did this have on the behavior of

21   smokers as far as the need to try to quit?

22             MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  Which

2       Q    Dr. Cummings, have you studied the smoking

3   patterns of � of consumers, including RJR consumers,

4   from the 1950s going forward and the smoking rates?

5       A    Yes, I have.

6       Q    And what � what effect does assuring smokers

7   that they don't need to quit yet have on smokers

8   attempting to quit or even deciding whether they need to

9   attempt to quit?

10            MR. WALKER:  Same objection, Your Honor.  I

11        just don't know what smokers he's talking about.

12             THE COURT:  You mean cigarette smokers as

13       opposed to some other type?

14            MR. WALKER:  Well �

15            MR. PRYSOCK:  I apologize.

16   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

17       Q    I'll say cigarette smokers in particular,

18   Dr. Cummings.

19            MR. WALKER:  What cigarette smokers is he

20       asking about?

21             THE COURT:  Okay.  You can clear that up.

22             Overruled.

23       A    When you look at population trends and

24   quitting, clearly in the early � from the '50s through

25   the '60s, there was very little quitting actually

1   happening, and so they have been successful in that

2   decade, from 1954 up to the time of the release of the

3   Surgeon General's report, really, you know, discouraging |

4   anybody from giving up cigarettes.  And they described

5   it that way, as a successful campaign.

6            And then there was this battle back and forth

7   after the '64 report.  You know, had it been proven or

8   not proven?  We just don't know.  And, again, reassuring |

9   an addictive smoker to keep him smoking.  So it dulled

10   the quitting because when we compare that to where we

11   are today when the companies finally admitted that their |

12   products cause cancer, emphysema, was addictive, smoking |

13   rates are plummeting to record low levels.  Cigarette

14   consumptions have now fallen to levels where it was in

15   the 1930s.

16            And very few kids are taking up smoking,

17   thankfully.  So we're really seeing the benefits of when f

18   people got full and informed, accurate information what

19   it would do.

2 0       Q    Let me follow up on that:

21            When did R. J. Reynolds and the other tobacco

22   companies stop denying that it was a controversy and

23   that it's still unknown if smoking causes cancer and

24   other lung diseases like emphysema?

25       A    Liggett & Myers, 1997.  The other companies

1   after 2000.  It was actually October of 2000 for Philip

2   Morris when � they didn't make it sort of public.  They

3   changed their website.  And then it was a few years

4   later for R. J. Reynolds and Lorillard.

5       Q    So � so since that time, has there been

6   anybody out there putting out messages that science

7   still hasn't determined if cigarette smoking causes lung

8   diseases?  Or now is it a universal acceptance?

9       A    It's universally accepted.

10       Q    And what has happened to smoking rates since

11   they stopped denying it?

12       A    We are at the lowest level that we've been in

13   many, many decades.  I think the prevalence of adult

14   smoking, the last numbers that I saw last week was

15   around 15 percent.  And for youth the levels are

16   somewhere about 4 to 8 percent depending on which state

17   you're in.  But record low levels and still falling.

18       Q    So we've got � so we've talked about the

19   meeting and � and the plan, we've seen the blueprint,

20   what was the first thing they did as a result of this

21   meeting publicly to start the plan in action?

22       A    Well, they announced the formation of the

23   Tobacco Industry Research Committee, which was allegedly

24   this research organization that was going to look into

25   the allegations that cigarette smoking caused lung

1   cancer and other serious diseases.  They did that in a

2   full-page ad called The Frank Statement to smokers.  It

3   was published in over 400 newspapers, mainly in large

4   population centers so it would have broad reach.  It was

5   a paid ad, so they could control the message in the ad.

6   It was signed by all the manufacturers.

7       Q    And what � what is that statement called that

8   was taken?  And how many newspapers was this taken out

9   in?                                                                                                                        |

10       A    Over 4 00, about 44 0, I believe it was.

11       Q    And was this a small print thing in the

12   newspaper?

13       A    No.  They did a full-page ad in most

14   newspapers.  If they couldn't get the full page, they

15   took a three-quarter-page ad, so it was a big ad.

16       Q    How unusual was that for a corporation to do

17   that at any time?

18       A    Well, I mean, it's not unheard of certainly,

19   but, you know, it was a � it was a big deal and it

2 0       was � you know, it was a paid ad and it cost them a lot

21   of money and they talked about how to divvy it up, and

22   that's how they came up with the formula to contribute

23   to these organizations based on their cigarette sales.

2 4       Q    Okay.                                                                                                f

1   companies contributed more, and as companies got bigger,

2   they contributed more; as companies got smaller, they

3   contributed less.

4       Q    Let's look at the Frank Statement if we could.

5   PT307.

6            And you referenced this before.  Tobacco

7   Industry Research Committee.  Is that also known as TIRC |

8   when we're looking at some of the documents later, TIRC?

9       A    Yeah.  And in March of 1964, they changed their f

10   name.

11       Q    Why did they change their name from Tobacco

12   Industry Research Committee � what did they change it

13   to?                                                                                                                        |

14       A    The Council For Tobacco Research.  So they

15   wanted to drop the linkage to the tobacco industry, but

16   essentially it was the same organization.  It was run by |

17   the CEOs of the companies, their lawyers.  The law

18   committee really set the policy for these � for the

19   organization.  Any public statements were vetted by the

20   lawyers for the cigarette companies so they would speak

21   with a unified voice and ...

22       Q    But what was the public stated purpose of TIRC 2 3       which later became CTR?

24       A    To study the allegations that cigarette smoking f

25   caused lung cancer, and to provide factual information

1   to the American public about what they found.

2       Q    Okay.  So this is The Frank Statement.  It came

3   out � when did you say again?

4       A    This is January 4th of 1954, so they had the

5   meeting on the 14th, the 15th, the 24th of December, the

6   26th of December.  The 28th of December is when they

7   approved the final version of the ad.

8             So they did view this as a crisis.  They were

9   meeting repeatedly, and this was the final ad that came

10   out January 4th.

11       Q    Was this the first public statement after that

12   meeting where � where they actually started with the

13   public as far as what the blueprint was?

14       A    Yes.  As a unified voice.  And certainly the

15   companies themselves had put out individual statements

16   before this time denying the link between smoking and

17   disease, but this was the first one they did jointly.

18   And you see many of these joint statements coming out

19   over the next 45 years.

2 0       Q    Okay.  Let's read The Frank Statement:

21             There is no proof that cigarette smoking is one

22   of the causes �

23            And they're talking about causes of?

24       A    Causes of cancer specifically.  They're

25   referencing the mouse-painting experiments, I think, in

1   the first paragraph of this � or this ad.

2       Q    We accept an interest in people's health as a

3   basic responsibility paramount to every other

4   consideration in our business.

5            What does paramount mean?

6       A    Number one.  The top � the top priority.

7       Q    We believe the products we make are not

8   injurious to health.  We always have and always will

9   cooperate closely with those whose task it is to

10   safeguard the public health.

11            Whose task is it to safeguard the public

12   health?

13       A    Well, I mean, certainly the Surgeon General of

14   the United States, doctors, public health officials.

15   But the cigarette companies also have a responsibility

16   to act responsibly.

17       Q    And they say that:

18            We will cooperate closely � or we always have

19   and always will cooperate closely with � with those

20   whose task it is to safeguard the public health.

21            Are we going to show examples of whether they

22   cooperated closely going forward with those whose task

23   it is to safeguard the public health?

2 4       A    Sure.  We already have.  We showed how they did

25       not disclose their HIPPO documents in 1963 to the

1   Surgeon General's advisory committee.  That's just one

2   example.  We'll show others.

3       Q    Okay.  After The Frank Statement, did they �

4   did the cigarette companies start putting out other

5   information regarding research and whether cigarette

6   smoking was a cause of lung cancer?

7       A    Sure.  In fact, in one of the meetings at the

8   Plaza Hotel, it was brought out that one of the lawyers,

9   Tommy Ross for the American Tobacco Company, had written

10   a White Paper on smoking and health.  So this is before

11   any research had been done.

12             That White Paper was issued in April of 1954 by

13   TIRC, and it was essentially a layman's writing of

14   reassurance that many people were challenging the link

15   between cigarette smoking and diseases.  The first of

16   the so-called white papers.  They did this one in '54

17   and then they reinstituted them in 1968.  And every time

18   there was a Surgeon General's report, they would issue a

19   White Paper about a day before, you know, counteracting

20   what they knew was going to come out in those reports,

21   which was more evidence implicating their product is a

22   cause of serious illness.

23       Q    And who were these White Papers sent to?

24       A    They were sent to anybody that asked the

25   companies.  So if you as a consumer would ask, they

1   would send you a copy of the White Paper.

2             But mostly it was sent to opinion leaders.

3   These were editorial writers of newspapers, at

4   television stations, and so on.  And again intended to

5   get their voice out.  And, in fact, they did detailed

6   analyses of who would get their reassuring messages and

7   how successful they had been in sort of the turning of

8   tide that was mounting in the early '50s linking smoking

9   to disease.

10       Q    We talked a little bit before about filters,

11   but just to put it in context:  So the Wynder studies,

12   the mice-painting studies come out in late '53.  They

13   then meet at the end of '53, and then in '54 The Frank

14   Statement comes out.

15            What started happening with filtered cigarettes

16   at that time after the Wynder studies as far as

17   consumers and � and the brands they purchased?

18       A    Well, smokers went to filter brands.  So

19   anybody who was initiating smoking essentially went to

20   the filter brands that were coming out.  So Kent and

21   Viceroy had been early filter brands, 1952.  And they

22   picked up substantial market share.  And then Winston

23   came out.  Marlboro, Salem, Kool, you know, went from

24   nonfiltered to a filtered brand.

25             So those were the brands that tended to really

1   pick up the market share.

2             The only one that hung in there for a while was

3   Pall Mall, and Pall Mall, as I said, had picked up

4   market share in the late '40s and continued through the

5   end of the 1950s and then they dropped off.

6       Q    Okay.  Now, let's � as part of the

7   conspiracy � not just White Papers, but did � did

8   the � did TIRC have scientists go on TV and make

9   statements in public interviews about whether smoking

10   was a cause of lung cancer?

11       A    Yes.  And they had spokespeople up here on

12   television.  "See It Now," which was sort of like the

13   "60 Minutes" version of today except they probably got

14   wider viewership because there were only three channels

15   at the time.  Edward R. Murrow.  And they did a two-part

16   series in 1955, and they had representatives from TIRC.

17            Mr. Hartnett, who had signed The Frank

18   Statement as the president of Brown & Williamson, he

19   resigned as president of that company and became the

20   chairperson for the T � TIRC.  He appeared in that

21   show.

22            William � Dr. DuPuis from Philip Morris.  He

23   was the chair of the Industry Technical Research

24   Committee which was the research directors of the

25   companies.  He appeared on that show talking about

1   the � you know, the issue of we're studying smoke and

2   if we find anything bad, we'll take it out.

3       Q    Okay.  So let's � if � and do we have a clip

4   of that?

5       A    We do.                                                                                              |

6       Q    So let's see this in action.

7             Does this show the plan in action as to what

8   they laid out in the forwarding memorandum?

9       A    It does, part of it.  This is just a � you

10   know, the TV news.  They also put out publication "Smoke

11   Without Fear" and an article that they both wrote that

12   appeared in True magazine through White Papers and so

13   on.

14       Q    And you mentioned Edward R. Murrow.  How

15   popular was he at the time?  Was he what popular newsman |

16   at the time?

17       A    Yeah.  He was probably one of the most popular

18   newsmen; obviously a famous World War II correspondent.

19       Q    So in his show, did he do a show devoted to

20   cigarette smoking after the Wynder studies came out?

21       A    Two shows.  He did them back to back in the

22   spring of 1955.

2 3       Q    And in that show did he discuss the Wynder

24   studies and what had been found as far as rats and �

25   and the link to lung cancer?

1       A    Yeah.  He interviewed people on both sides of

2   it.  He interviewed Dr. Wynder.  He interviewed

3   Dr. Hammond from the American Cancer Society who had

4   done an early study on smoking and describes some of the

5   work that the Cancer Society was doing.  People from the

6   National Cancer Institute were interviewed, as well as

7   representatives from TIRC, as I mentioned.

8       Q    Okay.  And we're going to show one of the

9   interviews from the TIRC; is that correct?

10       A    Yeah.

11       Q    Is this part of the plan that was laid out at

17            As Dr. Little said earlier, all of the research

18       of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee is done

19       independent of the cigarette companies.

20       Nonetheless, each major cigarette producer has been

21       conducting its own experiments on this problem.

22             This is the Richmond laboratory of one of the

23       major producers.

Our primary objective is to analyze all the components of smoke.  Of course, we do a great deal of research on analysis and technology of tobacco itself, but even if we knew all of the components of tobacco, we still would not know the components of smoke.  And since smoke is what we sell, we feel � we emphasize this phase of the research.

After we have produced the smoke and separated it into factions, the next step is to identify these factions.  These are then identified either photographically or on the oscilloscope.

The oscilloscope is now demonstrating the means of identification of one of these smoke components.

Using these instruments, we have isolated and identified some three dozen components of smoke. Many more will be identified.

As we find these components, we'll publish the results of our work in technical journals which are available to any scientist in any part of the world. So far we've found none that give us any cause for concern.

If we do find any that we consider harmful, and so far we have not, we'll remove these from smoke and still retain the pleasure of your favorite

3   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

4       Q    Now, let's look at what was going on internally |

5   at the company at the time.

6            We've looked at one document.  I would like to

7   go to 1958, and this is � who is Mr. Rodgman or

8   Dr. Rodgman?

9       A    Well, he was an analytic chemist hired by

10   R. J. Reynolds.  I believe he started in '54, and he did |

11   studies of smoke chemistry.  Actually, he was quite an

12   accomplished scientist, developed some of the technology |

13   that was used to help isolate the chemicals in cigarette

14   smoke.  And so he was their chief analytic chemist for a |

15   number of decades.

16            MR. PRYSOCK:  And let's pull up PT2141.

17   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

18       Q    The Optimum Composition of Tobacco and Its

19   Smoke.                                                                                                                  |

20            And I said '58.  I misspoke.  It's '59,

21   correct?

2 2       A    Correct.                                                                                          |

2 3       Q    Okay.                                                                                                |

1   directed to Mr. Kenneth Hoover.  Was Mr. Hoover some

2   low-level person at R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company?

3       A    No.  He was the � he was his boss.  He was the

4   director of research and development at Reynolds at this

5   time.

6       Q    And what did Mr. Hoover later become?

7       A    I believe he later, you know, was on the board

8   of directors of R. J. Reynolds.

9       Q    Some 30-odd polycyclic hydrocarbons have since

10   been similarly characterized in these laboratories.

11   Cholanthrene, a potent carcinogen, is one of three not

12   yet reported by other investigators.

13            All right.  Even though I mangled that � maybe

14   you should have read it for me, but what are polycyclic

15   hydrocarbons?

16       A    Well, those are a class of chemicals that you

17   get when you burn organic material.  And some of the

18   particular type of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are

19   known to be potent carcinogens.  So when you isolate a

20   particular type of hydrocarbon and expose the animal,

21   you know, you can actually get different potencies for

22   causing cancer.

23             So they had identified 30.  And this is 1959,

24   so the technology is really advanced.  They've got 30 of

25   these identified in cigarette smoke, some of which had

1   been reported in the literature, not all.

2             So, you know, there were other scientists and

3   academic institutions doing studies and publishing their

4   results at the time, but these are potent carcinogens,

5   something you would not want in cigarette smoke at all

6   because it's a carcinogen.

7       Q    And by the way, when Mr. � I'm sorry � when

8   Dr. Rodgman was studying cigarette smoke, which brand?

9   Was he studying their own brands?

10       A    Yeah.  He studied their own brands as well as

11   their competitors.  But he studied Winston and Camel.

12   He compared the amount of these polycyclic aromatic

13   hydrocarbons in different brands.

14             In fact, the Winston blend, the filter blend

15   actually turned out to have twice as many, over two and

16   a half times more of the potent carcinogens, these

17   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  That was based on a

18   study that was done, I think, in 1956, right after

19   Winston came out, compared to the tobacco in Camel

20   cigarettes.  So the filtered cigarettes with their new

21   blend actually was more carcinogenic.

22             THE COURT:  I think everybody needs to stand

23       up.  I'm going to try to get us out early today.

24       We're not going to take a long break.  So everybody

25        just stand up and stretch.

6             (The following proceedings took place in open

7   court outside the presence of the venire:)

8            MR. WALKER:  I was just going to say before the

9        jury comes back in I have an objection to Dr.

10       Cummings' last answer I want to raise.  Whenever the

11       appropriate time is.

12             THE COURT:  It's as good as any.

13            MR. WALKER:  I didn't know if she was set up.

14        She is.                                                                                                       f

15             I believe Dr. Cummings violated, again, the

16       Court's order that we discussed at side bar earlier.

17        Just to review, the order precludes Dr. Cummings

18        from testifying that any particular design in making |

19       cigarettes more addictive or more harmful.  And he

20        just testified, it wasn't even response to a

21       question that Mr. Prysock asked, he simply

22       volunteered as part of his answer that the filter

23       blend used in Winston cigarettes made them twice as

24        carcinogenic as other cigarettes.  I'm looking at

25       his answer on the screen.

Page 1374 The question was simply:  "Was Dr. Rodgman

studying cigarette smoke, was he studying their own

brands?"

That's a yes or no.  Dr. Cummings inserts into the answer that:  "In fact, the Winston blend, the filtered blend actually turned out to have twice as many � over two and a half times more of the potent carcinogens" and then he goes on at the end of that answer to say that "cigarettes, with their new blend, that's a design feature, was more carcinogenic."

That's a violation of the Court's order and I renew my request for the curative instruction that we provided to Your Honor earlier.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, respectfully, Your Honor, it's not Dr. Cummings' opinion.  It's in the next document from R. J. Reynolds where they discussed that and I'm about to show it to the jury.  It's their document that says that.  Dr. Cummings just got ahead of me.

THE COURT: I'll look at the document and see if I should do anything.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Sure.

THE COURT:  Bring in the jury.

MR. MITNIK:  Judge, I have one thing.

11   satisfactory flavor to please the consumer and should

12   contain sufficient nicotine to supply the necessary

13   requirements of the smoker with respect to this

14   compound.  Since the recent sales figures for Camel and

15   Winston cigarettes, both highest in the industry for

16   several years in their respective categories, indicate

17   that the consumer is obviously well satisfied with the

18   flavor and physically � or physiological contribution

19   provided by these cigarettes.  The optimum composition

20   of cigarettes smoked can be narrowed still further.  And

21   it should yield nicotine in the smoke in an amount

22   ranging from 1.5 to 2.0 milligrams per cigarette."

23            And then the footnote there to start at the top

24   talking about zero levels says:  "We consider the zero

25   level to be impossible to achieve as long as the

What are they talking about?  A level of what?

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

And those cause what, again?

Cancer.

Let's see what else Dr. Rodgman told or �

wrote this to Dr. Hoover, correct?

A    Mr. Hoover.  Ken Hoover.  Head of R&D at R. J.

Reynolds.

Q    "The physiological requirements of the smoker

with respect to nicotine can be met by the application

of the optimum amount of nicotine to the extracted

tobacco."

THE COURT:  Is this the document you referenced

earlier?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.  Oh, no.  No, sir.  Not

yet.  I'm coming to that right now.

Q    And let's look at another document, Dr.

Cummings, which is dealing with Winstons.  4993.  PT

4993.  And what year was this?

A    This is 1956.

Q    Okay.  I got a little ahead of myself.  I'm

sorry.  So this one, in order � and this was to who

1       A    This is again to Ken Hoover from Murry Senkus

2   and it's referencing the studies that they had done to

3   isolate chemical compounds in different blends of R. J.

4   Reynolds cigarettes.

5       Q    "As reported previously, the composition of the

6   smoke from Winston cigarettes with and without 6-7 X,

7   differs markedly from the composition of smoke from

8   Camel cigarettes or from flue cured cigarettes insofar

9   as the total content of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons

10   is concerned.  It was found that the fat in wax content

11   of the Winston blends do not differ appreciably from the

12   Camel blends, although the polycyclic aromatic

13   hydrocarbon content of the smoke from Winston cigarettes

14   was 2.5 times that of the smoke from Camel cigarettes."

15            Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, again, is

16   cancer causing agents?

17       A    Yes.

18       Q    In the smoke?

19       A    Correct.

20       Q    And Camel is an unfiltered cigarette, correct?

21       A    That's right.

22       Q    And Winston was a cigarette that they stuck

23   filters on, they made with filters, correct?

24       A    That's true.

25       Q    And what are they saying about the risk, the

1   amount of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in an

2   unfiltered cigarette, the Camel, versus the filtered

3   cigarette that they had started marketing and selling

4   extensively?

5            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  It's a

6       compound question and the document speaks for

7        itself.

8             THE COURT:  It's definitely compound.

9            MR. PRYSOCK:  I'll break it up, Your Honor.

10       Trying to move along.  Okay.

11       Q    What do they say about their own product and

12   the difference between the unfiltered Camel versus the

13   filtered Winston?

14       A    The blend of the Winston cigarettes, there's 2

15   and a half times more of the polycyclic aromatic

16   hydrocarbons found in the Winston blend compared to the

17   Camel blend.

18       Q    And in the 1950s �

19            MR. WALKER:  I'm sorry to interrupt but at this 2 0       time I do need to renew my request for the

21       instruction I requested earlier.

22             THE COURT:  Bring me the instruction and let me

23        just see.  I'm not sure.  Please come.

24             (The following took place at the bench:)

1       give.  And the � I would never � I would never

2       give an instruction like this.  But that's been

3       suggested.  But I do appreciate having it prepared

4        in anticipation.

5             I do think it should be cleared up that what he

6       said earlier was based on what he read and not based |

7       on his research.

8            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

9             THE COURT:  Do you understand the distinction?

10            MR. PRYSOCK:  I do.

11             THE COURT:  And if it's not, then I don't want

12       him to do it.

13            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yeah.  Well, when the objection

14       was made a little bit earlier, Dr. Cummings wasn't

15       talking about the addictiveness of cigarettes.  The

16       polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are the � which I

17        still can't say � is the cancer causing effects.

18             THE COURT:  I understand.

19            MR. PRYSOCK:  That's undisputed.  There's no 2 0                dispute about that.

21             THE COURT:  I understand that.  He went into

22       detail to a question that didn't ask for it. 2 3                           MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

1            MR. PRYSOCK:  Right.

2             THE COURT:  And that increased something

3       instead of decreased something.

4            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

5             THE COURT:  And he was not using �

6            MR. PRYSOCK:  He wasn't using the document.

7            MR. WALKER:  He went beyond the document as

8       well.  He said it made those cigarettes more

9       carcinogenic.  The document doesn't even say that.

10             THE COURT:  Well, I think if you understand �

11        from what I've been told about all that polycyclic

12       blah blah stuff, hydrocarbon, that means that that's

13       what � that those are carcinogens and so I don't

14       take issue with that.  But I don't want him giving

15       opinions beyond � in these regards other than what

16       he � if he wants to say this is what he read and

17       using this from the material, fine.  But I want that

18       cleared up.  Let me tell you, if he says that it is

19       something that his research � I mean, some sort of

20       thing that he's done, I'm going to give some sort of |

21       curative instruction.

2 2                            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

7   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

8       Q    When we were talking a few minutes ago, when we

9   had the other document up and you indicated that � you

10   indicated something about the effect of adding filters

11   to Winstons and the net effect of the additional

12   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons as compared to

13   unfiltered cigarettes, was that based upon this document

14   that you knew was � that was coming next?

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    Okay.  Thank you, Dr. Cummings.  I would like

17   to go now to �

18            MR. PRYSOCK:  Which one was that?  Now, let's

19       go to PT 2125.  You know what?  Let's come back to

20       that.  We've been jumping around a little bit.

21       Q    But I would like to cover this and a couple

22   more things in the last few minutes we have so we can

23   wrap up this whole entire topic.

to America in 1958?

1

2       A    Yes.

3       Q    And what was BAT, B-A-T?

4       A    British American Tobacco.  They were the parent

5   company for Brown & Williamson here in the United

6   States.

7       Q    And what is significant about PT 3289 in the

8   historical context as far as, you know, you know, as far

9   as evidence that you take of knowledge of the tobacco

10   companies?

11       A    Well, it provides a date when � because these

12   three scientists came and they interviewed some of the

13   research directors at the cigarette companies.  They

14   went to academic researchers, The National Cancer

15   Institute, the Tobacco Industry Research Committee,

16   Scientific Advisory Board, the technical research

17   committee of the tobacco companies, again, made up of

18   primarily the research directors of the major

19   manufacturers, and they essentially did an assessment to

20   find out what they believed about whether cigarette

21   smoking caused lung cancer.

22            And they drew conclusions based on their survey

23   of all these individuals.  Over 40 individuals were

24   visited including a representative from Reynolds that

25   participated in a meeting, I think, of the Tobacco

1   Industry Research Committee.  Specifically Dr. Rodgman

2   attended that meeting on May 5.

3            And so it provides � do you want to know when

4   the companies all believe that cigarette smoking caused

5   lung cancer?  This document provides that.

6       Q    Is there any dispute about that historical

7   context that this document provides the proof that

8   they � all of them knew at that time?

9            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  Any

10       dispute with whom?

11             THE COURT:  Okay.

12   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

13       Q    Is there any dispute in your mind based upon

14   your review and study of all the records that at this

15   time this is conclusive proof that they all knew?

16       A    Yeah.  Based on all the people that they went

17   to interview, that includes people from within the major f

18   cigarette companies, R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris,

19   American Tobacco, Liggett Meyer Tobacco, all the major

20   manufacturers, as well as academic researchers,

21   scientists of the National Cancer Institute.  And they

22   said with one exception, Harry S. Green, he was a

23   pathologist at Yale University.

2 4                            "The individuals whom we met believed that

25       smoking causes lung cancer.  If by causation, we mean

1   any chain of events which leads finally to lung cancer

2   and which involves smoking as an indispensable link."

3             In the United States or in the USA only

4   Berkson, he was a statistician up at Mayo Clinic in

5   Minnesota, apparently is now prepared to doubt the

6   statistical evidence, although his reasoning is nowhere

7   thought to be sound.

8       Q    And this was 1958.  And when they say the

9   individuals they interviewed, did they interview the

10   scientists at the companies, including R. J. Reynolds?

11       A    Yeah.  There's an itinerary as part of this

12   document that shows the dates when they went and had the

13   visits, who they met with, the technical research

14   committee.  I don't know who was there but I have a

15   roster of who was at that meeting on May 5.  That's how

16   I determined that Dr. Rodgman was there.

17       Q    And is this document one that's always been

18   available or did it just become public in the last

19   decade or so?

20       A    This was an internal secret document not

21   available to anybody in the public domain until the

22   documents became public in the late 1990s.

23       Q    So they met in 1953, the Frank Statement came

24   out in 1954, the plan was developed.  This is 1958.  At

25   this point did the cigarette companies including R. J.

1   Reynolds stop the blueprint they had put into motion and

2   come forward and admit what they were discussing

3   internally?

4       A    No.  They double down.  They created the

5   Tobacco Institute in 1958.  And so, no, they didn't.

6   They actually invested more money in their public

7   relations effort to counter the claims that they

8   believed internally that their products caused cancer.

10   public statements.  Who was �

11             THE COURT:  While you're taking that moment, I

12       want to tell the jurors, this is for the whole

13       trial.  You're going to be coming back day in, day

14       out.  Especially after lunch.  I know what the

15       situation is.  But if you ever kind of feel like

16       you're getting noddy or, you know, drowsy or

17       anything, stand up and everything will circulate.

18       You won't bother anybody if you do that.

2 0       Q    Okay.  And do we have some examples of the

21   statements by the heads of these tobacco organizations?

22       A    Yes.

11   diseases.  That came out January 11, 1964.  It was a

Mr. Cullman, prominent in the New York theater and

civic affairs is a third generation member of a

tobacco family.

Mr. Cullman, their conclusions are pretty stark and pretty solid.  They say quite flatly the � they express the judgment that cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and to the overall death rate. Then they have the rate of 10 times as high for smokers in the case of lung cancer and rather higher in other cases.

Well, that's awful hard to define the word substantial.  I don't believe that most people that smoke will get lung cancer.  We are now in an era, as you know, of moderation.  We eat more carefully, we have cholesterol habits, we have drinking habits of lighter whiskey.  We have smoking habits, which, incidentally, today are changing the type of cigarettes from regular cigarettes to filters.  Now, I was surprised at the beginning of the conference when Dr. Terry is supposed to have said that there's very little evidence, if any, on the effect of filtered cigarettes.  So when we have today 60 percent of the business in the filter field compared

1       to 3 percent ten years ago, I think we need a little

2       more research.  I'm convinced that eventually they

3       will find some element through a filter or through

4        leaf growing or special type of seed of growing that

5       will eliminate the mysterious thing they are looking

6       for.  We want to be the detective just as much as

7       the Surgeon General and the AMA.  We'll cooperate in |

8       every way.                                                                                                |

9            Well, are you saying then, sir, that there is

10        something toxic about tobacco which are removable by |

11        filter?

12            Well, obviously a filter takes out certain tar

13       and nicotine.  I don't think the industry admits

14       there are any bad elements.  If there are bad

15       elements, through our laboratories, through the

16       Surgeon General, through the AMA, through acts of

17       God, luck, we hope we may find them.  And if they

18       are found, they will be removed.  But at this point

19       we do not know.

20             Does any of the research that the tobacco

21       industry has been engaged in refute any part of the

22        findings here or the conclusions as a whole?

23            Well, without reading the report, I couldn't

24       answer that to begin with.  I don't think the

25       tobacco industry as a whole agrees with the

BY MR. PRYSOCK:

Q    Dr. Cummings, are there a lot of examples of this, where the statements publicly are talking about we don't know or there's still a controversy?

A    Many, yes.

Q    Okay.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Let's pull up Face the Nation.

Q    Face the Nation was what at the time in 1971?

A    Like it is today.  It's a Sunday morning news show.  And they have people who are important in the news.  In 1971 when cigarette ads went off of television they had Joe Cullman, President of Philip Morris and the chairperson of the Tobacco Institute, you know, Executive Committee.  So he represented all the companies when he appeared on Face the Nation to talk about and answer questions about smoking and health. The news story was cigarette ads are coming off of television at that time.

Q    And he represented you said all the companies including R. J. Reynolds at that time?  He was specifically speaking for the cigarette companies including R. J. Reynolds?

A    Yeah.  The Tobacco Institute had an Executive

1   Committee made up of all the CEO's and they had a

2   chairperson they would vote in every year and in 1971 it

3   was Joe Cullman.

4            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  Let's play this.

5             (A video clip was played and transcribed by the

6       court reporter to the best of her ability as

7        follows:)

8             From CBS, Washington, in color, Face the

9       Nation, a spontaneous and unrehearsed news interview

10       with Joseph Cullman, III,  chairman and chief

11       executive officer of Phillip Morris, Incorporated

12       and chairman of the Executive Committee of the

13       Tobacco Institute.

14            We have no program that I know of to try to

15       help people to stop smoking.  We do talk to the

16       question of whether or not cigarettes are hazardous.

17       We do not believe that cigarettes are hazardous.  We

18       don't accept that.  Because when, as, and if any

19       ingredient in cigarette smoke is identified as being

20       injurious to human health, we are confident that we

21       can eliminate that ingredient.

22             Do you believe that cigarettes are safe?  Have

23       they been proved to be safe, Mr. Cullman?

24             I believe they have not been proved to be

25       unsafe.  I did read that report.  I conclude from

5   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

6       Q    And what does the report he was referring to

7   that had just come out regarding cigarette smoking

8   during pregnancy �

9       A    There had been a study that had come out of NIH f

10   talking about the fact that women who smoke during

11   pregnancy are more likely to have low birth weight

12   infants.

13       Q    Let's pull up one more and then we'll conclude

14   with one more document, Dr. Cummings.  Let's see.

15   1751-AA.                                                                                                             |

16            And as you're pulling that up, let me ask you,

17   what was Nightline?

18       A    Nightline, again, a news show, this appeared � |

19   this came on after the nightly news so at 11:30, I think |

20   Ted Koppel was the � early on, the host of that show.

21   And, again, they would have topics that they would cover |

22   as part of the Nightline series.  That usually ran at 2 3       11:30 in the evening on ABC.

24       Q    And who was Ed Horrigan, the gentleman pictured f

25   here facing us?

1       A    At the time he was the President of R. J.

2   Reynolds Tobacco Company, so he later became the

3   President of Liggett and Myers and he appeared on

4   Nightline talking about the open debate campaign that R.

5   J. Reynolds launched in 1984 as a way to talk to the

6   public about the controversy of cigarette smoking and

7   disease.

8       Q    Open debate about what?

9       A    Whether cigarette smoking caused any illness.

10       Q    Okay.  Was it an open debate at that time?

11       A    No.  It was a � it was not a debate.

12   Scientifically that had already been determined.  But it

13   was a public debate because the companies continued to

14   deny that smoking caused disease, so they kept the

15   controversy alive and this is one of the ways they did

16   it.

5             It is not known whether cigarettes cause

6       cancer.  It has not been causally established.

8       between cigarette smoking and emphysema?

9            Despite all the research to date there has been f

10       no causal link established.

11            No causal relationship between cigarette

12        smoking and heart disease.

13            No.  As a matter of fact, there are studies

14       that while we are accused of being associated with

15       heart disease, there have been studies conducted

16       over ten years that would say, again, that science

17        is still puzzled over these forces.

22   was caused � causes cancer?

2   person at Brown & Williamson attended this meeting.  I

3   think it was in South Hampton, United Kingdom.

4            And so they gave talks.  There was a series of

5   talks by each of the people participating primarily on

1       Q    And this document itself, which the jury will

2   have the full document, but since we're running out of

3   time, this document is discussing what as far as new

4   products?

5       A    Well, design of the cigarette with regards to

6   the importance of nicotine and the cigarette being a

7   delivery device for nicotine that has unique advantages,

8   speed of delivery of the drug, low cost for production,

9   and low dose.

10            And they comment on these factors being so

11   unique in terms of delivery of nicotine and how

12   beneficial it is to the companies and they have a

13   summary that discusses this.

14       Q    And the Brown & Williamson attendee was at this

15   conference, correct?

16       A    That's right.  This was by Collin Greg from

17   British American Tobacco.

19   highly, pharmalogically effective and cheap drug,

20   tobacco, which also confers flavor and manual and oral

1   any time around 1984 or when these things were being

2   discussed?

3       A    No, they did not.

4       Q    Did they continue to design nicotine with � or |

5   cigarettes with nicotine and continue to develop new

6   products with nicotine as they're talking about new

7   products here?

8       A    Yes.  They did.  Nicotine was the key design

9   feature and they made sure there was sufficient amount

10   in the product to keep somebody addicted.

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  Thank you, Your Honor.  It's a

12       good stop.

13             THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going

14       to take off for the weekend.  I would like to try to |

15       start at, again, like we did this morning at 8:30 or |

16       maybe even a little earlier possibly.  But please be

17       here at 8:15.

18             I know people are going to want to talk to you

19       about what you're doing here.  You can't talk to

20       them.  Do not do any research and do not talk to

21       anybody about this case, not even among yourselves.

22       You are excused. 2 3                             (Jury out.)

2 4                           MR. WALKER:  I have a motion, Your Honor.

2 5                            THE COURT:  Okay.

Page 1400 MR. WALKER:  I need to move for a mistrial.

Over our objections, Dr. Cummings was permitted, in

fact, at least once asked to opine before the jury

that the cigarette companies implemented designs to

make cigarettes addictive over and above the

addictive level that they have just from having

nicotine and he was also permitted over our

objection to opine that a design was implemented

that made Winston cigarettes more carcinogenic.

No curative instruction was given to the jury that they could not rely on any of that testimony for that purpose.  It's a violation of the order that was entered.  And we requested it twice.  We are now left with no ability to respond to that opinion now that it's been given.

We came into this trial with the understanding that we would not be debating the substance of whether or not any design made cigarettes addictive apart from nicotine, but whether any design made them more carcinogenic.  We have no ability to respond to that.  No curative instruction or even a limiting instruction was given.  We cannot now have a fair trial for the defense.

THE COURT:  Thank you very much.  I think it was clarified that what was being relied upon was

Page 1407 MR. SEIDEN:  We did, sir.  I'm happy to hand them

another copy and a copy for the Court.

Your Honor, if you will recall, at your -- one of your August pretrial conferences in this case, the Court pulled out its boilerplate sheet of final pretrial issues, which I know the Court's familiar with.

The first one on that says experts should not have any new opinions that haven't been disclosed.  The third one says something to the effect of no new material should be given to a witness since the deposition.

We had some discussion in the context of medical records and that's not at issue.  And everyone said, "That's it, no more."

And what we found out � do we have Dr. Cummings in the courtroom?

THE BAILIFF:  He was � he was sitting right there.

MR. SEIDEN:  What we found out � I think he's out.

What we found out during the first day of his testimony, first, at sidebar Mr. Mitnik told you Dr. Cummings now has an addiction opinion and defendants better not go there.  And we weren't planning to ask him whether he had an addiction opinion, but we're concerned that he's received additional case materials that would

In addition, he provided other testimony, for example, that showed he clearly had provided � been provided new materials since his deposition.  For instance, he put an year on when Mr. Price likely switched to Winston cigarettes, talked about the years he started smoking, said that he � Mr. � he testified � he volunteered Mr. Price �

THE COURT:  Wait outside, please.

MR. SEIDEN:  He volunteered that Mr. Price had died from emphysema.  And you'll recall he had details about the exhibit list, a document he hadn't seen.

Now, back at the conference, you started talking � you referenced the fact that people � litigants seek to have witnesses excluded for violation of that rule.  We're not asking for that.

What we'd like at this point in time is a disclosure from plaintiff.  We asked them yesterday. They didn't respond.  And I asked them this morning and they said it didn't happen.  But we'd like to understand what is the basis upon which Dr. Cummings was -- formed new opinions and what additional information has been disclosed to him since his deposition.

And we'd like a direction from the Court that Dr. Cummings shouldn't refer to any materials that -- in

2       deposition.  And we're not going to go there except to

3       follow up on that which he has already said in front of

4       the jury.

5             MR. MITNIK:  Just one thing because I said

6       something at the bench I want to correct.  At the bench,

7       I thought they were � in opening, they were implying

8       the negative, that because Dr. Cummings had no opinion

9       about addiction, he must think the man was not addicted,

10       which we had a motion in limine on.

11             In that back-and-forth, I said, if they go

12       there -- I don't remember my exact words, but if they go

13       there, he has opinions or has reviewed materials and he

14       wasn't there � I misspoke � from Mr. Prysock and I, I

15       had � was worried about that happening because

16       Mr. Prysock said something to me to me about, well, if

17       he has an opinion, he can give an opinion.  I presume he

18       reviewed materials.

19             Mr. Prysock told me this morning -- he goes, he's

20       not reviewed materials.  I was talking about if they go

21       there, I will give him a hypothetical.  So for the

22       record, on -- I'll leave the rest to them.  But on that

23       particular point, he has not reviewed the addiction

24       case-specific materials.  I misspoke.  I misunderstood.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Your Honor, Dr. Cummings hasn't reviewed anything new.  I don't know what this is � as far as the disease he had, that was in my initial discussion with Dr. Cummings about � about retaining him in this case.  The guy died of emphysema.  They don't dispute that.  It's in the stipulations. There's nothing new.  He's not talking about, you know, anything other than � than it was just what Mr. Price died of.

As far as the � this � I don't understand this argument about a switch to � when he switched to Winstons.  Dr. Cummings testified Winstons didn't come out until 1954.  I asked him if he assumed that he started smoking at age 12, which would have been 1948, he would have had to have switched to a filter at some point.  It's just common sense.  They weren't out before 1954.  And if he smoked Winstons, he would have had to switch to Winstons.  That's it.

He hasn't reviewed anything in addition, and we're not going to have any new opinions from him, if that's the concern.  And I've told them that.

MR. SEIDEN:  Your Honor, I appreciate what Mr. Prysock just said.  I would just like a clear � ask the Court for a clear representation from plaintiff's

deposition, which was the state of play at the time of

his deposition.

MR. PRYSOCK:  No, he hasn't.

MR. SEIDEN:  Okay.  If it continues to be an issue, we'll raise it with the Court.

But now we're in, not only in the evidence but our essential witness.  I don't know how much he missed, but I know if a juror said, can I go to the bathroom; I'11 be back in five, Your Honor wouldn't say, go ahead and we'll keep the testimony going, because you never know which piece of testimony is going to be essential.  And this is our key witness.  I don't know what he's missed. I don't know how we'd ever find out.

But we do know he was sleeping during the testimony of our witness.

The other thing, Judge, is it's distracting to the other jurors.  It was noticed that one of the other jurors sitting near him or more than one noticed him sleeping too and were taking some steps to do something about him themselves.  So I don't know whether it's nudging or -- (demonstrating) � or whatever.  I didn't personally see it.  Others on my team did.

And so the point is (a) I don't know what he's missed.  I don't know how we recapture.  And (b) it's becoming distracting to other jurors and it's not a one-time thing.  And this is a witness that we can't afford to miss any and we have alternates.  And I would like him removed.

And I know the natural thing is let's wait and see

Page 1413 and keep an eye on him.  The problem is if it's

distracting to other jurors and the unity of the jurors,

then it's a problem to be addressed now, and I'd like to

remove him now since we have alternates.

THE COURT:  Would defense like to be heard?

MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.  I think � I think the issue is premature.  I just will make a couple of observations.  At the moment in time where I noticed that that particular juror may have been struggling, there were a lot of people in the courtroom who were struggling to stay awake.  It's not worth trying to highlight it.

But I think we just reached a point in the testimony where things were starting to drag a little bit.  Everything that was described by Mr. Mitnik, I believe, occurred before the point in time where Your Honor gave the jury as a whole an instruction that essentially told them, look, if you need to stand up and stretch, whatever, let us know.  I just think it's premature.

But the juror had not had an opportunity to use the information that Your Honor gave him.  I'm not even sure he's the only juror who nodded off during that part of the presentation.  I just think it's premature.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I've got -- I've been observing

Page 1414 that juror and he didn't snore.  But � but when I said,

"Let's take a break; everybody stand up," he didn't

stand up.  I mean, he had to be pushed to wake him.  I

mean, he was asleep.  He wasn't nodding, which is

different than sleeping.

I'm going to -- I'm not going to disrupt anything right this minute.  I'm going to go ahead and proceed, but I will take it under consideration at the end of the day.  So bring that up.

MR. MITNIK:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Where's my bailiff?  I need to tell him what to do.

There you go.  Would you bring in the jury?  And bring out Dr. Cummings.

Officer, you here, new bailiff or �

20                  DIRECT EXAMINATION (CONTINUED)

21   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

22       Q           Sir, we left off Friday.  And one thing I want to

23   go back to that I actually just inadvertently forgot to

24   bring up on Friday, we were talking about documents and the

25   documents that you're showing here today.  Are there also

1   formerly internal company documents that discuss destroying

2   other documents that may not particularly be good for the

3   defendant?

4       A     Yes, there are.

5       Q     Okay.  And have we got a couple examples of those?

6       A     We do.

7             MR. PRYSOCK:  So first of all, if we could pull up

8       PT2181.

9       Q     And this is 1969.  And which company is this from?

10       A     This is R. J. Reynolds, a memo sent from Murray

11   Senkus, who was the vice president of research and

12   development, to Max Crohn, who was a lawyer in the legal

13   department at R. J. Reynolds.

14       Q     "We do not foresee any difficulty in the event a

15   decision is reached to remove certain reports from research

16   files.  Once it becomes clear that such action is necessary

17   for the successful defense of our present and future suits,

18   we will promptly remove all such reports from our files.

19             "As a rule, we invalidate about 15 reports each

20   year for various reasons.  The most common reasons for

21   invalidating a report and/or reguiring rewriting are

22   erroneous interpretation of data.  As an alternative to

23   invalidation, we can have the authors rewrite those sections

24   of the reports which appear objectionable."

25             And when they're talking about reports and -- and

1   findings, what -- what's going on at the time that they are

2   trying to invalidate or that they are concerned about, as

3   you read this document?

4             MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  It calls for

5       speculation as to what the author was concerned about,

6       pursuant to the pretrial order.

7             MR. PRYSOCK:  Dr. Cummings � I'll lay a

8       foundation, Your Honor.

9             THE COURT:  Okay.

10   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

11       Q     Dr. Cummings, have you reviewed other documents in

12   a historical context at the time as to what Dr. Senkus and

13   other scientists at RJR were looking at?

14       A     Yes.

15       Q     And what is that, sir?

16       A     Well, they were looking at �

17             MR. WALKER:  I'm sorry, Your Honor.  It's the same

18       objection.  If he has a document he wants � they want

19       to show, that's one thing, but there's a pretrial ruling

20       about interpreting what's meant by this document.

21             THE COURT:  The guestion didn't ask him to

22       interpret.  He just asked him what was going on at the

23       time.

24             And leave it to the historical.

25             THE WITNESS:  Sure.

1        A     The historical information indicates that Reynolds

2   had contracted to do mouse skin painting experiments,

3   comparing different types of tobacco, and they had the

4   results comparing their commercial tobacco versus what they

5   called "Sutton material," which was a synthetic material

6   that they had created as an alternative, which was much less

7   carcinogenic.

8        Q     Did they turn over those reports to the

9   government?

10        A     No, sir.  No, they did not.

11              MR. PRYSOCK:  Let's look at another document,

12        PT6338.

13        Q     And are you familiar with this document, sir?

14        A     Yes.  These are notes from Alan Rodgman, who was

15   the scientist at R. J. Reynolds who oversaw the work that

16   was being done up in Canada.  It was a contract lab run by

17   Dr. Chappel, so you see Dr. Chappel's name at the top.

18              And he's talking about what they need to do with

19   the Chappel records, which had demonstrated that their

20   commercial tobacco was about eight times more carcinogenic

21   than the Sutton material.

22        Q     And when you say "commercial tobacco," what �

23   what does that mean?

24        A     That means the tobacco that they were using in the

25   cigarettes that they were selling to consumers.

1
	Q     Okay.  And this says -- what does it say here,

2
	sir?  And, again, which company is this document from?

3
	A     This is R. J. Reynolds.  This is Dr. Rodgman.

4
	He's saying destroy -- destroyed reports and letters for

5
	legal reasons.  His only copy, leave it up to Chappel to

6
	destroy them.

7
	Q     Okay.  And that's � is it -- destroyed, is that

	A     Yes.                                               i

10
	Q     As in it had been done?

11
	A     Correct.                                           1

12
	Q     Okay.  And what time -- what time frame was

13
	this when this was done?

14
	A     Well, they had the -- the contract with IBT Labs

15
	up in Canada during 1969, 1970, and the project was shut

16
	down in 1970 essentially.

17
	Q     And what was R. J. Reynolds saying publicly at

18
	that time about whether cigarettes caused lung disease?

19
	A     They did not is what they said publicly, that

20
	cigarettes did not cause lung disease or any other

21
	disease.                                                   ii

22
	Q     And were Dr. Chappel's studies turned over to the

23
	government or public health officials?

24
	A     No.                                                i

1       Q     And have you seen this document before?

2       A     Yes.

3       Q     And this is from which company?

4       A     Again, this is R. J. Reynolds.  This is

5   Dr. Teague, Dr. Colby, who ran their research library at

6   R. J. Reynolds, and it's indicating "This is to inform you

7   that I have either returned to the library or destroyed all

8   formal reports and the like checked out to me."

9       Q     And what year was this?  I'm sorry.

10       A     This was November 6th, 1975.

11       Q     Based upon your review of these documents and the

12   internal workings of R. J. Reynolds, is it your opinion that

13   there are additional documents that we can't show the jury

14   because they were destroyed by R. J. Reynolds?

15       A     Yes.

16       Q     Okay.  I'd like to go back.  We talked, in the

17   1950s, about the mouse painting studies coming out and those

18   types of things, and then we had that consumption chart,

19   where there was a dip around 1953, 1954, when the LIFE

20   magazine article came out and those types of things.

21             Let me ask you, have you seen internal company

22   documents where they discussed what happened after they

23   launched the plan at the Plaza Hotel and the conspiracy

24   began?

25       A     Yes.  They talked about how successful their

1   public relations campaign had been in turning around public

2   attitudes about smoking and that sales had, in fact,

3   rebounded, and it had been an effective -- what they refer

4   to � "defensive operation."

5             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  And if we can pull up one of

6       those documents, PT1608.

7       Q     And which company is this document from?

8       A     This is from Ed Darr, who's the president of

9   R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, to his counterpart at

10   American Tobacco Company, Paul Hahn, who had called the

11   meeting at the Plaza Hotel.  Dr. -- or Mr. Darr is

12   complimenting Mr. Hahn on what a success it has been.

13       Q     And this � going back, just for reorientation,

14   that meeting was where they brought in Hill & Knowlton and

15   started the TIRC and TI and those types of things?

16       A     Correct.

17       Q     Okay.  And at that meeting � by the way, I don't

18   think I asked you before -- but did they bring in scientists

19   and public health officials at that meeting or just a PR

20   firm?

21       A     No, just a PR firm and the executives and

22   presidents of the companies.

23       Q     Okay.  "Dear Mr. Hahn, you took a bold and

24   courageous action in December of 1953 when you called for a

25   meeting of manufacturers and other industry groups to

1   discuss ways and means of presenting a united front against

2   the claims that were being made that cigarette smoking

3   causes lung cancer.  The formation of the Tobacco Industry

4   Research Committee was the result.

5             "There is absolutely no guestion in my mind that

6   if this committee had not been formed, the cigarette

7   industry by now would have been in a deplorable position.

8   Instead, a very fine job has been done in counteracting

9   unverified, unjustified and unsubstantiated claims of the

10   anti-cigarette fanatics.  In other words, the TIRC has been

11   a successful defensive operation."

12             And if you � if we look at the consumption chart,

13   Dr. Cummings, does that bear that out, that � that it was a

14   successful operation, defensively, in -- in getting people

15   back to smoking?

16       A     Yes.  I mean, cigarette sales guickly rebounded in

17   1954 and continued to increase up until the time that letter

18   was sent in late 1957 and actually continued to go up really

19   until the early part of 1964, when the Surgeon General's

20   Report came out, when there was another little dip.

21       Q     And we talked about that LIFE magazine article,

22   the big � the big article that came out when the mouse

23   painting studies came out.  There were other things too,

24   right?  The public health was trying to get out the word

25   about the dangers of smoking, not just that LIFE magazine

1   article, right?

2        A     Sure.  I mean, there were studies being done by

3   scientists and universities.  The American Cancer Society

4   had done a large prospectus study; in other words, where

5   they took individuals who were otherwise healthy smokers and

6   nonsmokers and then followed them forward to look at the

7   occurrence of disease.  And --

8        Q     And it was being reported in other things, like

9   Reader's Digest, correct?

10        A     Sure.  And it was getting reported in Reader's

11   Digest, Time, newspapers and so on.

12        Q     Okay.  Let's look at a couple examples of � of --

13   of public health trying to get the message out.

14              Now, Reader's Digest was one and over the years,

15   did they run more than one story about smoking and � and

16   its belief or Reader's Digest -- the belief that it caused

17   lung disease?

18        A     Yeah.  Reader's Digest, ran a number of

19   stories on � on smoking and health, I think dating back

20   into the 1920s.  Reader's Digest didn't take cigarette

21   advertising.

22        Q     Was that unigue for a magazine back then?

23        A     It was.

24                 Q           And  �  but   Reader's   Digest,   how  many   articles

25        appeared  over  that   40-   --   40-plus-year  time   frame?

1        A     Well, there were about -- well, as it says right

2   here, 36 stories appeared between 1924 and 1966.  That was

3   really a fraction of all the stories that were in Reader's

4   Digest magazines, but you can, you know, find 36 stories

5   that dealt with issues related to smoking and health, the

6   difficulties that people have stopping smoking and so on.

7   And they were often reporting on things that were in the

8   medical literature at the time.

9        Q     Was discussion about smoking or things about

10   smoking also making its way into some popular culture

11   things, like songs?

12        A     Yes.

13        Q     Okay.  And as far as �

14        A     You know, Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette, sort

15   of a joking way of talking about smoking.  That was a

16   popular song, I think, in the early � late '40s, early

17    '50s.

18        Q     How did a song like that interplay with what was

19   social acceptable -- socially acceptable back then versus,

20   you know, a true warning about cigarettes?

21        A     Well, made light of smoking, really.  It wasn't a

22   serious song about, you know, getting sick from smoking and

23   being addicted.  It was � made light of it and it fit in

24   with the context of smoking at the time, which was � was

25   perceived as a normal lifestyle decision to be made.  And,

1   you know, you could smoke anywhere and smoke your brains out

2   basically.

3       Q           Okay.  Let's play that song.  And who is this by?

4       A           Tex Williams.  I mean, there are -- a lot of

5   artists have done Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette, so

6   he's one that appeared on the radio they had in the interim.

7             (Video was played as follows:)

8             "UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Now, I'm a fellow with a

9       heart of gold, with the ways of a gentleman I've been

10       told, a kind of fellow that wouldn't even harm a flea.

11       But if me and a certain character met, the guy that

12       invented the cigarette, I'd murder that son of a gun in

13       the first degree.

14             "Now, that ain't that I don't smoke myself, and I

15       don't reckon they'll injure your health.  I've smoked

16       them all my life and I ain't dead yet.  But nicotine

17       slaves are all the same, at a pheasant party or a poker

18       game.  Everything's got to stop when they have that

19       cigarette.

20             "Smoke, smoke, smoke that cigarette.  Puff, puff,

21       puff and if you smoke yourself to death, tell St. Peter

22       at the Golden Gate that you hate to make him wait, but

23       you just got to have another cigarette."

24             (Video clip was stopped.) 25

1   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

2        Q     Okay.  Let me ask you, there's a reference in

3   that.  He says something to the effect � I'm paraphrasing

4   here, but it � it ain't because it hinders my health.  I

5   smoke and I am -- got hurt myself or something like that.

6   Are you familiar with that line?

7        A     Yes.

8        Q     Okay.  How is that � based upon your historical

9   study of the knowledge and belief of smokers at the time, in

10   this time frame, how does that interplay with that?

11        A     Well, it's fairly consistent with public beliefs,

12   as I think we talked about on Friday, which was in the early

13    '50s, nobody really believed that cigarette smoking was a

14   cause of cancer.  The perceptions of any harm related to

15   smoking were things like irritation in the throat, might get

16   your wind, stunt your growth.  Those were the concerns, not

17   serious health problems like cancer and emphysema.

18        Q     Okay.  Let's look at one more example of public

19   health trying to get the word out as these studies are

20   coming out and -- and, you know, what the tobacco company

21   knew internally but -- but what public health is trying to

22        do.

23                                 MR.   PRYSOCK:      If   we   can  pull   up   �

24                  Q            Who  was   Leroy  Burney?

25                  A           He  was   Surgeon   General   of  the   United   States.      I

1   believe this is a guote from 1957, where he was asked to

2   come before congressional hearings and was asked at those

3   hearings about what the Public Health Service was doing to

4   educate the public about the dangers of smoking.  The

5   U.S. Public Health Service � actually Dr. Burney, you know,

6   said that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer in 1957, as

7   did the joint committee.  That was the cancer organizations,

8   NIH.  It all came out with the joint report in 1957.

9             And as he said, "Our position is that we have

10   informed the public through the excellent coverage of the

11   press, radio and TV, we believe that this is as far as we

12   should go at this time until and when we have additional

13   information."

14             And so that's what he said in -- in that

15   congressional hearing when he was asked what they were

16   doing.

17       Q     And Dr. Heller is the director of the National

18   Cancer Institute at the time, correct?

19       A     That's right.

20       Q     And Dr. Heller said:  "Newspapers, radio and TV

21   and other media have done an excellent job covering this

22   problem and a very objective job.  We wish to proceed in an

23   orderly, dignified and proper manner in order to present the

24   facts as they become available to us to the public."

25             Let me ask you this:  At the time that these

2   what the tobacco industry was doing through supposedly

3   independent research, like Council For Tobacco Research,

4   et cetera?

7             THE COURT:  Sustained.

8   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

9       Q     Now, we've looked at a few examples of public

10   health trying to get the word out.  Despite what public

11   health was trying to do, were the companies discussing

12   internally how they were counteracting this public health

13   message?

14       A     Yes.

15       Q     And did they discuss the successfulness -- other

16   than that one document we've seen, are there other examples

17   where they've discussed how successful their campaign was in

18   tamping down the fears about smoking?

19       A     Yes.  Addison Yeaman, in 1963, talked about, in

20   the Battelle Hippo memo, that the TIRC had been a successful

21   public relations gesture, and there are other documents from

22   The Tobacco Institute, which was created in 1958 as a result

23   of that letter from Mr. Darr to Paul Hahn, where he said, we

24   need to create a separate organization to speak on our

25   behalf.  That's when The Tobacco Institute was formed, and

1   they talked frequently about the success of their efforts

2   over -- over many decades.

3       Q     And if you could, Dr. Cummings, are there examples

4   of how it continued to be ingrained in society and social

5   norms, smoking, into the '60s, even after some of these

6   things came out?

7       A     Yes.

8             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  If we could look at a couple

9       examples, PT6262.

10       Q     And this is � what is this, Dr. Cummings?

11       A     Well, this is LIFE magazine and they're talking

12   about the American space program, sort of the heros of the

13   day.  And these were the astronauts.  And they done a cover

14   story on them, and they featured the astronauts inside the

15   magazine, many of them who were smoking.

16       Q     Had � you know, in American culture, how � how

17   big or how popular were astronauts back at that time?

18       A     They were huge.  I mean, they were, you know, as I

19   said, the heros of the day.  They were risking their lives

20   and, you know, every time they shot off a rocket ship with

21   the astronauts going up in space, it was the focus of

22   American public attention.

23       Q     And what are we seeing here?  Is this a -- is this

24   from inside the magazine article?

25       A     Yes.  This is the inside and they're featuring,

1   you know, the lives of these astronauts.  And I think this

2   is the verbiage written, it's at least, you know, taking

3   time out for a cigarette.

4       Q     "After a tiring day, Donald Slayton and Virgil

5   Grissom take time out for a smoke."  Is that the caption

6   under � this is, like, a big photo spread.

7       A     That's right, again, reflecting how normal it was

8   to be a smoker.  I mean, even the best trained, most fit

9   Americans were smoking.

10       Q     And the astronauts were considered intelligent

11   people back then?

12       A     Yes, they were.

13             MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor, lack of

14       foundation.

15             THE COURT:  Okay.

16   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

17       Q     Was there criteria to get into the astronaut

18   program?

19       A     Yes.

20             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  And, in fact, let's look at

21       another example, PR397.

22       Q     And what do we have here?

23       A     Again, it's showing how common smoking was.  These

24   are just examples of athletes who were smoking.  You can see

25   Hank Aaron, Vince Lombardi on the sideline.  He was the

2   Stan Mikita, NHL champion Hall of Famer for the Chicago

4   after they'd lost Super Bowl I, smoking the cigarette.  Joe

5   DiMaggio, Yogi Berra.

6              Again, just a lot of the same people who were

7    featured in ads.  These are just depictions of them smoking

8   as a normal part of their lives.

9        Q     And the first Super Bowl, that was 1967; is that

10   right, when Dawson �

11        A     I believe it is.  It's mid '60s, I believe.  I'd

12   have to go back and check my Super Bowl trivia to know

13   exactly the date.

14        Q     Okay.  That's all right.

15              All right.  We talked some about advertising the

16   other day, and I want to touch on a couple things that we

17   didn't talk about.  And this � getting back to social norms

18   of advertising in America at the time, were there ads � was

19   a big, prominent feature in ads holiday themes for

20        cigarettes?

21                  A            Sure.

22                  Q            Okay.

23                  A            They  were.

24                                 MR.   PRYSOCK:      And  do  we   have   examples   of  those?

1       A     We see a number of ads for Christmas with the

2   holiday gift cartons, so it was common to give gifts of

3   cigarettes.  You can see, you know, Santa Claus.  These are

4   Reynolds' Camel ads.  There's Father's Day.  There's

5   Halloween.  Anytime there's an opportunity to give out

6   gifts, the cigarette � cigarette companies were there to

7   promote them as part of the holiday.

8             And, you know � and so it was very common to have

9   the gift cartons that you would give away.  As children, you

10   know, making ashtrays for Mom and Dad was common.

11       Q     Okay.  One thing I also think I forgot to cover on

12   Friday was use of cartoons, Sunday funnies and ads and

13   things like that.

14       A     Sure.

15       Q     Was that a popular thing to do back, you know, in

16   the '40s and '50s, when Mr. Price was growing up?

17       A     Actually, we find examples of cartoons in the

18   '30s, '40s and '50s, where there are cigarette brands �

19   Reynolds did this for Camel and Winston cigarettes in the

20   '50s and actually in the early '60s.

21             The comics were syndicated so there were companies

22   that would make up the comics and put them in your Sunday

23   paper, and you would read comics for Winston, Camel

24   cigarettes.  Just like a product placement in a movie or in

25   a television show, you actually had them built into the

1   comics.

2             And this is just some examples you'd see for Lucky

3   Strike.  There's Camel.  I think we've got a Winston one

4   there but Winston did it as well.

5       Q     And this � this composite, which is PT503E, does

6   this show examples of that from R. J. Reynolds?

7       A     Yes.

8             MR. PRYSOCK:  Oh, PT503C.  Sorry.

9   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

10       Q     All right.  Let's talk about another aspect of

11   this.  What are candy cigarettes, Dr. Cummings?

12       A     They're cigarettes made out of � or they're candy

13   made to look like a cigarette and very popular many decades

14   ago; less popular today.  But you can make them out of

15   sugar, and a little sugar would pop off if you, you know,

16   smoked it and actually have a little bit of � like it was

17   almost smoke coming out, but it was sugar off the end.

18       Q     And let's -- have you seen internal company

19   documents where they talk about other companies making candy

20   cigarettes?

21       A     That's right.  Yes, I have.

22       Q     And what � first of all, before we look at the

23   internal ones, let's look at an external one.  Were � were

24   the cigarette companies asked -- or was a cigarette company

25   asked if they � if they were involved in candy cigarettes

1   or if they allowed them?

2       A     Yes.  Because many of the candy cigarettes used

3   sort of takeoffs on the -- the names of the popular brands

4   at the time.  And so they were questioned by members of

5   Congress and public health authorities as to whether they

6   were allowing their trademarks to be used.

7             MR. PRYSOCK:  And let's � first, we can look at

8       PT1357.

9       Q     And this is to who?

10       A     This is to Governor Meyner, who was the former

11   governor of New Jersey, who was placed in charge of

12   enforcing the voluntary Cigarette Advertising Code, which

13   the cigarette industry put out in the '60s that basically

14   said that they wouldn't market candy products or anything

15   that would be appealing to youth.  They wouldn't use young

16   people in ads that depicted physical activity, for example,

2       Q     And what � when these candies were � or when

3   these cigarettes were produced, what are they talking about,

4   use of the label, that type of thing?

5       A     Well, they're talking about a trademark,

6   basically.  Raleigh had a distinct package and they were

7   replicating that.  Plus the name Ralette was sort of a

8   takeoff on Raleigh.

9             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  One more, PT1353.

10       Q     And this is � is this to another candy company?

11       A     Yeah.  This one is Lucky and Raleigh labels.

1   to use their brands in cigarettes?

2       A     This is inconsistent with what they told the

3   governor of New Jersey, with what they had, in fact, been

4   doing for -- for a decade.

5       Q     Okay.  All right.  We talked about a variety

13   filters and that type of thing.

18   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

19       Q     Dr. Cummings, in the '50s and '60s, what was the

20   theme of Winstons when they were becoming a successful

21   cigarette brand after coming out in 1954?

22       A     Great tasting cigarette in a filter, pure white

23   filter.  And so Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.

24   Those were the themes.  They talked about their filter

25   blend.  So in the '50s, they � to the late '50s, in

1   particular, they emphasized their pure white filter.

2        Q     Okay.  Let me ask you, up front, ahead of a modern

3   filter, was that a theme, modern filter, for Winston

4   cigarettes?

5        A     Yes.

6        Q     All right.  And we talked about filters already

7   and the benefit of filters, if any, correct?

8        A     Correct.

9        Q     Okay.  Let me ask you, another brand that

10   Mr. Price smoked, Pall Malls.  Guard against throat scratch,

11   how popular was that theme with Pall Mall advertising?

12        A     It was very popular.  The extra filtering,

13   naturally through the extra length of the Pall Mall

14   cigarette, that was the main selling theme.  You know, guard

15   against throat scratch, extra mildness, those were common

16   themes in Pall Mall advertising.

17        Q     Okay.  And let me ask you, another brand earlier

18   back or going back more �

19              MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I'm sorry.  If this ad is

20        displayed, may we have the year of the ad?

21        Q     Dr. Cummings, do you know the year of this ad?

22        A     Offhand, I believe it's in the 1940s, but I can't

23   give you the year. 2 4       Q     Okay.

Q But even if we don't know the exact year, sometime in the 1940s?

A     Yes.

Q     Okay.  This would have been when Mr. Price was a boy?

A     Right.

Q     Let me ask you, another brand, Kools.  And we talked a little bit about this.  But what � Kools was a brand Mr. Price smoked.  And what � what is a � what is the main feature of Kools or the main selling point of Kools in their advertising?

MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  It's vague as

to time frame.

Q     What has consistently been the theme of Kool cigarettes since they were introduced in the 1940s or 1950s?

A     Menthol.

Q     Okay.  And tell us what menthol does, Dr. Cummings, as it relates to the smoker.

A Cools the throat, anesthetizes the airways. So it numbs it so it's easier to take a bigger, deeper puff of the smoke as it � basically, it's masking the irritation of the smoke particles going into the airway.

Q     Have you seen documents where the cigarette

8        Q     Okay.  Strike that.

9              Dr. Cummings, based upon your own research and

10   studies of smokers, what is it about Kools that attracts

11   certain demographics?

12              MR. WALKER:  Same objection, Your Honor, as to the

13        time frame.

15   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

16        Q     Go ahead.

17        A     Based on my research that I've done on this topic

18   of flavor is particularly menthol, being the most prominent,

19   it basically is more attractive to young people who are

20   learning to smoke because it's easier to learn how to smoke

21   if you're masking the harsh irritation of inhaling hot smoke

22   that's irritating to your airways, which is why Kool,

23   Newport, other menthol brands are very popular among young

24   people.

1       that.  I don't know what the appropriate time would be

2       to take that up.

3             THE COURT:  Why don't we come to sidebar.

4             MR. WALKER:  Okay.

5             (A sidebar conference was held outside the hearing

6   of the jury as follows:)

7             MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, when we -- during

8       pretrial hearings, when we were discussing the evidence

9       at plaintiff's request, you ruled that no document could

10       be admitted unless there was -- a foundation was laid

11       for the document through a witness on the stand.

12       These -- these documents have not been -- there's been

13       no testimony about when those advertisements are from.

14       Many of them are undated.  So I don't think that's an

15       adequate foundation for them.

16             He said they've � they're over the decades.  He

17       hasn't discussed these ads with him, and he certainly

18       hasn't gone through each ad to explain whether it ran,

19       during what period of time it ran, if at all.

20             And so I object under the ruling that was � that

21       you made at plaintiff's request.

22             THE COURT:  Well, I think the reason I � that I

23       wanted to make certain that the � that their

24       authenticity was stipulated to was � was � was there

25       any objection to the authenticity of these documents?

Page 1444 MR. WALKER:  Well, here's the problem, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  That suggested no, first.

MR. WALKER:  No.  Sorry, Your Honor, no.  But we discussed that issue at the time you made the ruling. They reguested � because I said, we have self-authenticating documents that we want to put in, for which there would be no issue of authenticity.  They have not objected to the authenticity of our newspaper articles.  They couldn't � they're self-authenticating.

So if it's only an authentication issue, then we shouldn't need to use those with the ones � I understood Your Honor to be saying something beyond authenticity relating to a foundation.

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. WALKER: If it's only an authenticity issue, then that would apply to our evidence as well. Then I shouldn't need to use them with the witness.

MR. PRYSOCK:  The whole issue �

THE COURT:  Let me ask you a guestion.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Have you got some thought that there's an interpretation as to their documents, an additional foundation needs to be raised?

MR. PRYSOCK:  No, sir.

THE   COURT:      Other  than   relevance   and  authenticity.

witness who I can have an opportunity to cross examine.

They can't just stand up in their case and put in

documents.  That was the issue.  I mean, if I need to go

through each one of these -- but he's testified that

these are the types of ads, and these are the things in

the ads.  These are the ones that Mr. Price --

THE COURT:  Well, let me ask you a guestion.  And I � do you � do you want me to have him go through each one and ask him if that's a Kool ad?

MR. WALKER:  Here � here's what I want.  If he's going to be able to put those in because he's --there's no issue about the authenticity, I want to be able to put my documents in as to which there's no authenticity.

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. WALKER: What they reguested at the hearing was that the documents be identified with the witness one by one.

MR. WALKER:  Right.

3
	MR. WALKER:  Uh-huh.

4
	THE COURT:  And that was what I understood as a

18

19
	MR. WALKER:  These documents would be discussed

believe was being of concern, over objection, was, for

example, if somebody stood up and played the Perry Mason

ad --

MR. WALKER:  Right.

THE COURT:  � or, you know, there's several, just played them �

MR. WALKER:  Right.

THE COURT:  � would not -- with no soul saying, hey, this is a � you know, this came from Perry Mason --

MR. WALKER:  Uh-huh.

THE COURT:  � a popular TV � that would be objectionable, with somebody saying Perry Mason was popular, and this was shown on CBS 100 times or 1,000 times or whatever it was.

MR. WALKER:  Right.

THE COURT:  Then that would be admissible.

MR. WALKER:  So �

THE COURT:  And I think that was the distinction.

MR. WALKER:  As long as � as long as -- then that � the exhibits that I want to use, which I will discuss with the witness and are self-authenticating, if I can put those in without going through them one by one because they will have the opportunity on redirect,

opportunity to deal with those documents with the

witness?

THE COURT:  He's going to show your witness some documents.  Are you going to have a problem with that?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Not if he shows them and asks them questions about them.  That was the whole thing.  You have to put this -- them.

THE COURT:  You don't have � we don't have �

MR. WALKER:  I just want to be sure because what I want to do is show them as a group in the same way he has.  If he's later saying I have to go one by one, then he should have to go one by one through his.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Let me tell you, the only � the only other thing is � and I don't know how -- what y'all have agreed to -- obviously it's his case, as far as -- as far as it being marked or -- I've never quite understood why you have to wait until the other side --you've already laid it.

MR. PRYSOCK:  I don't have a problem with that, but he has to ask the witness about the document. Again, the whole issue was so we can --

THE COURT:  I understand.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

Page 1449 MR. WALKER:  Before you walk away, he has not

asked the witness about the majority of the ads that he

came up with.  All he did was say, are these exemplars

that he asked no guestions about.  I'm going to do the

exact same thing, Your Honor, and what I don't want to

have happen is �

THE COURT:  It's not going to happen, Mr. Walker.

MR. WALKER:  Okay.

THE COURT:  What I understood pretrial was the other type of situation --

MR. WALKER:  Very well, Judge.  Thank you.

MR. PRYSOCK:  But if he doesn't ask the witness � if he doesn't ask Dr. Cummings about a document, then I am going to object as it not coming in pursuant to the pretrial rule.  So it's up to you if you ask Dr. Cummings about --

1       you mean.

2             MR. PRYSOCK:  Based on the aforesaid, this is not

3       an issue because you made your ruling.  You said it

4       consistently up here and it's just up to the defense to

5       ask Dr. -- if they want to put ads in evidence,

6       self-authenticating, they simply need to ask the witness

7       about it, have it come in through that witness.

8             THE COURT:  Yeah.  But if he has a pile of things

9       like that that are a composite, he's not going to ask

10       him about each page.

11             MR. PRYSOCK:  But what � they're trying to turn

12       this into one composite.  There's 30 different subjects.

13       This is not a composite.  This is simply ads.

14             THE COURT:  Let me tell you something, if that's

15       going to be a problem, give that to Dr. Cummings.

16       Identify each one of those things.

MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I'm not looking for an exact date for each one, but if he's unable to say when a brand -- I do think there's a relevance problem because these ads �

THE COURT:  If that's your objection � if these ads � I am not going � I believe they're relevant based on the evidence that has come in and the tobacco litigation from Engle IV, if that's your objection. But � but I � I understand how you want to find out if -- if or when various things were released.

6   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

7       Q     Okay.  Dr. Cummings, the objection -- so let's go

8   through and -- which ad or what �

9             THE COURT:  Rephrase that.  I had an instruction

12   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

14   identify which company it's from and which -- which brand it

15   is?

16       A     Sure.  These are all R. J. Reynolds.  But Kool was

17   originally a product manufactured by Brown & Williamson and

18   it's now � was acguired by R. J. Reynolds.  So the first

19   set of ads are for Kool cigarettes.

20       Q     And what time frame would these ads have run?

21       A     '30s, '40s and '50s.

22       Q     Okay.

23       A     So the first ad is a Saturday Evening Post ad,

25   Kool cigarettes for 15 cents.

Page 1454 The next one is a Collier's National Weekly ad,

also for Kool.  There is no date on it, but it looks to be

the same period, late 1930s.

There is a series of ads that are, again, Willie

the penguin.  They're cartoons, like the cartoon-type.  It's

actually a cartoon like you see in the newspaper for Willie

the penguin.  There is no date on this particular ad,

although it -- it's clearly the unfiltered, the cork tip but

not filtered Kools, which were popular in the latter part of

the '30s and '40s and into the early '50s.

So the first one I'm looking at is the � the

cartoon.  There's another Willie the penguin cartoon.

Third, the one that's a cartoon, where you could write in,

get a coupon, that says "1951," offer of coupon on it.  So

one of the cartoon ones does give a date.

There's another �

Q    What was the date on that cartoon one?

A     1951.

Q     Okay.

A     There's another cartoon one for Kools, undated. Another one, cartoon.  Here's --

Q     How old would John Price have been in 1951?

A     Well, he was born in 1936, so, you know, what, 14, 15 years of age.

Q     Okay.

1       A     Here's another one.  That's Willie, where you

2   could get and order salt and pepper shakers.  They had

3   Willie and Millie.  So salt and pepper.  And that's also

4   1951.  "Send for your attractive, colorful Willie and Millie

5   salt and pepper shakers."

6       Q     Okay.  If there's a group of them for the Kools,

7   you can just say � if it's a group, if there's a certain

8   time frame, hopefully speed this along a little bit.

9       A     Sure.  Looking at the 1963 Kool ad, it's a green

10   ad, and this one is clearly different because it shows that

11   they've added a filter.  And the filter tip went on the Kool

12   cigarettes, I believe, in 1956.  But the actual date of this

13   particular ad at the bottom, where it says "Come up to Kool,

14   feel extra coolness in your throat," is 1963.

15             Then we're back to an undated one for Kool with

16   Willie the penguin with a cork tip.  So these obviously are

17   earlier, I would say the 1940s.

18             And there's a series there.  There's another one

19   that says "15 cents" with Willie the penguin, "The season's

20   best catch."  He's skiing in this particular cartoon ad �

21   or actually fishing, actually ice fishing in this one.  It's

22   15 cents so that would be the latter part of the 1930s

23   because that dates it.

24             Another one, 15 cents.

25             Another one for 15 cents with Willie the penguin.

1             Saturday Evening Post one, 1939, there's a date at

2   the top of that one.

3             Another 15 cents, the late '30s, another Saturday

4   Evening Post, 15 cent ad, so that would put it in the late

5   '30s.

6             Another Saturday Evening Post, Willie the penguin

7   ad, August 20th, 1938.

8             Another 15 cent Willie the penguin, catching a

9   football.

10             There's one that says:  "When your throat feels

11   dry as the desert, in between the others, smoke a Kool,

12   gives your throat a welcome change.  The mild menthol is

13   definitely refreshing."  That's in the 1940s.

14       Q     And how about the Pall Malls, if we go on to those

15   ads?  First of all, when -- when did Pall Mall rise to

16   popularity?  When was it -- and how popular was it?

17       A     Well, they came out with the extra length in the

18   late 1930s, but it really grew in the 1940s and early 1950s

19   and became one of the top-selling brands during that period

20   of the '40s and '50s.

21       Q     And we referenced, in the guard against throat

22   scratch, the theme there.  When was that theme a popular

23   theme for the Pall Mall ads and � the ones we have in

24   there?  What time frame?  What decade?

25       A     '40s and '50s.

3       A     Yes.  And some of them you can date.  There's a

4   World War II theme with two soldiers, a fighter jet during

5   World War II era.  So that would date the ad, although

6   there's no specific date, but I would say in the mid 1940s

7   or early '40s, around World War II.

8             There's a later ad because Pall Mall came out with

9   the filter version of its product in the 19- -- late 1960s.

10   I think it was '68.  And there's a filter version of Pall

11   Mall, so that would be in the late '60s.

12       Q     And then if we look at the Winston ads � now,

13   Winston, if we go a little bit later, when did Winston come

14   out again?

15       A     Winston came out in 19- � March of 1954, so all

16   their ads would be, you know, after 19- -- March of 1954.

17   So there's a 1962 ad and a horse race.  "Winston tastes good

18   like a cigarette should.  It's what's up front that counts.

19   Filter blend, up front, ahead of the modern filter.  Only

20   Winston gives you filter blend."  That's 1962.

21             You know, similar one, what's up front that

22   counts, in the same time period, early '60s.

23       Q     Okay.  And � and in some of the later ads,

24   towards the end of the Winston, is there a -- well, strike

25   that.

1              Let me ask you this:  What year did warning

2   labels, the little box at the bottom, go into cigarette

3   advertising?

4        A     Would have been '72.  So the warning labels went

5   on the cigarette pack but not in advertising actually until

6   1972.

7        Q     And do we have examples of those in there too?

8        A     You do.  I have one here from 1973.  That shows

9   the warning and then there's a � a note on it.

10              1980.  And you can date it because of the Surgeon

11   General's warning there, which said "The Surgeon General has

12   determined that cigarette smoking is dangerous to your

13   health."

14              And these ads basically say:  "When your taste

15   grows up, Winston out-tastes them all.  Only Winston's

16   sun-rich blend, the choicest, richest tobacco tastes as full

17   and satisfying," ad for Winston.  That's from 1980.

18              Winston tastes good like a cigarette should,

19   that's 1973.

20              There's one �

22   moment, Dr. Cummings, if we can, so we can move on.

10   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

11       Q     Okay.  We talked the other day some about youth

12   marketing, and we gave a couple of examples.  But just to be

13   clear, Dr. Cummings, are there many more examples of youth

14   marketing by R. J. Reynolds and the other cigarette

15   companies over decades of time?

16       A     Yes.

17       Q     All right.  And are there discussions as to

18   reasons why they marketed to kids going back -- when was the

19   first document we looked at?

20       A     Well, the first one we looked at was a 1984 market

21   analyst document that looked � did a 50-year look back on

22   the success of brands that had captured a share of the youth

23   market and how important that was to the profits of the

24   cigarette companies.  In other words, they had to capture

25   replacement smokers.  Otherwise, their profits would dry up

1   because the adults would either guit or die.

2        Q     Okay.  Well, let's move � just so there's no

3   guestion about it, let's move through these a little

4   guickly, if we can, move on to another topic.

5              MR. PRYSOCK:  But PT33108.

6        Q     Are you familiar with this document?

7        A     Yes.  This is the files of Brown & Williamson

8   Tobacco Company talking about, you know, young adult

9   smokers' lifestyle and attitudes.

10        Q     Okay.  Who's responsible for Brown & Williamson?

11        A     R. J. Reynolds.

12        Q     Okay.  The � and does this document give some

13   explanation as to why underage kids smoke or why � why kids

14   begin smoking?

15        A     Yes.

16        Q     Okay.  And this is � was this a public document,

17   or was this a secret document from Brown & Williamson?

18        A     This was secret, internal to the company, in their

19   marketing department.

20        Q     The purpose of this, "Young adult smoker

21   lifestyles and attitudes."  And we're going to talk about

22   that term again.  The purpose of this research was "to gain

23   insight into the perceptions, attitudes and behaviors of

24   younger, recently started smokers regarding initial product

25   usage, current smoking and health concerns."

1             And what time frame was this?

2       A     1970 � mid '70s, 1974.

3       Q     Okay.

4       A     Their advertising firm you can see above that,

5   Kenyon & Eckhardt, had been hired to do this work for them.

6       Q     Okay.  "Key findings.  Once becoming regular

7   smokers, young people still felt they were not addicted."

8             Based upon your research and studying the

9   behaviors of smokers yourself and your studies that have

10   been published, what is it � what is especially young

11   people's understanding of the addictive nature of cigarettes

12   when they begin and even after they've � they've become

13   regular smokers?

14       A     Many young people don't identify themselves as

15   smokers, even they � even though they may be doing it on a

16   fairly regular basis because they always believe that they

17   can guit and not terribly concerned about the health risks

18   of smoking either.

19       Q    Have you seen studies where people discussed --

20   young people are asked if they expect to be a smoker when

21   they get older and what they say?

22       A     Yeah.  Monitoring the future studies, which are

23   done by the University of Michigan, probably -- they go back

24   to the mid '70s.  And they ask teenage smokers, what are

25   the � what the � what is the likelihood that you would be

1   a smoker five years down the line?  And most young people

2   don't believe that they will be smokers, but when you

3   actually follow those individuals, particularly the ones

4   that had been smoking on a daily basis, almost all of them

5   are still smoking five years later.

6       Q     "Smoking by children and adults.  Those who start

7   to smoke at a comparatively early age, at 10 to 12 years, go

8   through a long period of experimenting with cigarettes

9   before taking up smoking seriously.  McKennell and Thomas,

10   in their social survey of adults' and adolescents' smoking

11   habits, 1967, show that at the age of 16, 57 percent of boys

12   and 63 percent of girls were smoking as many as one

13   cigarette a day.  It was during this period that the

14   foundations of smoking habits were laid.  Four out of five

15   young people who had smoked more than one cigarette

16   subseguently became regular smokers.

17             "Conversely, according to the survey, if a

18   youngster was still a nonsmoker at 20, he would be unlikely

19   to take up the habit."

20             Now, how does that correlate with other

21   documents you've seen internally that we've discussed about

22   crops of smokers and � and the need to market to specific

23       targets?

24                 A           It's   consistent,    certainly,   with  the   Burrows

25        document   that   had talked  about   the   fact   that   he  had  to  get

1   the smokers while they were young, that smoking initiation

2   occurs at a young age.  It was very rare for people to take

3   up smoking � I think Burrows said after the age of 24 and

4   here they said 20.

5       Q     "Addictive smoking.  The addicted" -- "the

6   addicted smoker smokes both for enjoyment and to reduce

7   unpleasant feelings.  He is always aware that he is not

8   smoking whenever this occurs.  And such awareness invariably

9   evokes distress.  The addicted smoker suffers whenever he is

10   without a cigarette.  He thinks that only a cigarette will

11   reduce his suffering and that there is no substitutes."

12             When they're talking about suffering,

13   Dr. Cummings, how does that -- what's the explanation of

14   that as far as withdrawals a smoker has, based upon your

15   research and studying smokers trying to guit?

16             MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  He's being

17       asked to interpret the author's meaning of the word in

18       this document.  There's a pretrial �

19             THE COURT:  Overruled.

20       A     Based on my research, it's � what happens is when

21   you have somebody who is addicted and they abstain from

22   smoking, they experience nicotine withdrawal, and they're --

23   feel a strong need to re-administer the nicotine, in other

24   words, have another cigarette to feel normal again.

25       Q     Okay.  Now, with the context of this document,

1   let's look at some other documents as to the actions of

2   the � have you seen other documents as to the actions of

3   the companies as to what they -- I'm sorry.

4             "Nicotine.  It has been said if it were not for

5   nicotine in tobacco smoke, people would be a little more

6   inclined to smoke cigarettes than they are to blow bubbles

7   or light sparklers.  As a novice acguires tolerance to the

8   irritation of the smoke over a period of two or three years,

9   he becomes conditioned to a high and regular intake of

10   nicotine."

11             How does irritation -- what -- how does that

12   interplay with what you talked about earlier, menthol in

13   cigarettes such as Kools?

14       A     Yeah.  I mean, the key is to get nicotine into the

15   airways, where you have a large surface area, rapidly

16   absorbed, gives you a guick hit, within 10 seconds or so.

17   And so smoke is irritating and so there are additives put in

18   the product.  Menthol is one of the additives that helps

19   reduce the irritation, makes it possible for the person to

20   administer the drug into the airways where it has its

21   effect.  And it hit the brain and altered the brain.

22             And once you develop tolerance to nicotine; in

23   other words, you need the nicotine in order to get the same

24   effect of the drug, which reflects the fact that you've

25   altered the brain by having new receptors grow in the brain,

1   you're basically feeding your brain nicotine.  Otherwise,

2   you go into withdrawal.

3       Q     Okay.  Let's look at � give you another document,

4   PT1233.

5             Who is Dr. Frank Colby?

6       A     He was in R&D, research and development.  He was

7   one of the senior scientists.  He ran the library for all

8   the studies that were done by Reynolds, but he was a senior

9   R&D scientist for Reynolds for many decades.

10       Q     And what date is this document?

11       A     1973.

12       Q     Okay.  "Cigarette concept to assure RJR a larger

13   segment of the youth market.  My suggestion covers all these

14   conditions.  It is basically to go back as much as possible,

15   probably at least halfway, towards the old filter

16   cigarettes, i.e., the cigarette of the 1950s."

17             The reasons why, one of them, "They deliver more

18   'enjoyment' or 'kicks' (nicotine) .

19             As far as tar and nicotine in smoke are concerned,

20   I believe it should be possible to achieve the desired

21   effect by going to a tar level of today's Pall Mall,

22   non-filter type, of about 29 milligrams of tar and 1.8

23   milligrams of nicotine.  Still with an old style filter, any

24   desired additional nicotine kick could be easily obtained

25   through pH regulation."

1             We're going to talk more about pH regulation in a

2   little bit.

3             But let me ask you this � the title of this

4   document was "Cigarette concept to assure RJR a larger

5   segment of the youth market."

6             Did they, in fact, come out with a

7   reformulated brand and -- and roll this out after this

8   memo came out?

9       A     They did.  Not Winston, however.  They

10   reformulated Camel in '74, launched it nationally in '75.

11   That was a reformulated blend for Camel.

12             And then they reformulated Winston in '79 to add a

13   pH modifier, ammonia, to the product.

14             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  Let's look at PT1040.

15       Q     "Research planning memorandum, some thoughts about

16   new brands of cigarettes for the youth market."  And this is

17   marked "confidential"?

18       A     Right.

20       A     Claude Teague.

21       Q     And Dr. Teague was what?

22       A     He was a chemist but at this point in his career,

23   he had risen up to be in charge of new product development

24   for R. J. Reynolds.  I think when he wrote this in 1973, he

25   was the assistant to the R&D director.

1       Q     "At the outset, it should be said that we are

2   presently, I believe, unfairly, constrained from directly

3   promoting cigarettes to the youth market.

4             "Realistically if our company is to survive and

5   prosper over the long-term, we must get our share of the

6   youth market.  Thus we need new brands designed to be

7   particularly attractive to the young smoker.

8             "For the pre-smoker and learner, the physical

9   effects of smoking are largely unknown, unneeded, or

10   actually guite pleasant or awkward" � "actually guite

11   unpleasant or awkward.  The expected or derived

12   psychological effects are largely responsible for

13   influencing the pre-smoker to try smoking and provide

14   sufficient motivation during the learning period to keep the

15   learner going, despite the physical unpleasantness and

16   awkwardness of the period.

17             "In contrast, once the learning period is over,

18   the physical effects become an overriding importance and

19   desirability to the confirmed smoker and the psychological

20   effects, except the tension-relieving effect, largely wane

21   in importance or disappear."

22             Okay.  A lot there.  But let me ask you, when

23   they're talking about the pre-smoker or the learning

24   smoker and the unpleasant response, how did adding

25   menthol to brands back in the 1940s and 1950s interact

1   with that?

2       A     Well, I talked about adding flavoring agents,

3   including menthol, being a predominant one.  And it's a

4   design feature that would attract the novice, the never

5   smoker, as well as the smoker who's experimenting with

6   cigarettes so they can overcome that experimentation and get

7   to the confirmed period, when the nicotine takes over to be

8   the overriding feature of why they continue to smoke.

9       Q     And that second paragraph, "The physical" � "Once

10   the learn period is over, the physical effects become of

11   overriding importance."

12             What physical effects do you see in smokers once

13   they become more than just learning smokers?

14       A     The physical effects is the need for nicotine and

15   their nicotine addiction.  That's what they're talking

16   about.  In fact, they describe it right in that table, I

17   think, that goes along with the memo.

18             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  And if we can look, PT1265.

19       Q     Again, which company is this?

20             MR. PRYSOCK:  Oh, I'm sorry.  This is still that

21       last document.

22       Q     "Effects expected or derived from cigarette

23   smoking."

24             Is this what you were talking about, the response

25   from nicotine?

1       A     Right.  They divide it up into physiological and

2   psychological, and you can see they score this as either a

3   positive effect that gets a plus sign.  If it's a neutral

4   effect or none, gets a zero.  And if it's a negative effect,

5   it's actually negative in terms of promoting smoking and

6   gets a negative.

7             So you can see in terms of the physiological

8   effects, cigarettes that -- you know, for nicotine, it's

9   unknown to the pre-smoker because they never smoked so it's

10   a zero.  It's a double negative for the experimenter, the

11   learner, because it's actually adversative.  Nicotine is

12   slightly irritating.  And for the smoker, we can see, gets

13   three plus signs.

14             And you can compare it to other physiological

15   reasons, and clearly nicotine is the overriding factor why

16   somebody who's a confirmed smoker keeps smoking, whereas

17   when you look at the psychological reasons, things like

18   self-image, experimentation, you know, things like

19   identification with valued persons, daring, sophistication,

20   free to choose, you get, you know, plus signs for the

21   pre-smoker and learner in the negative because you're not

22   free to choose once you're addicted.

23       Q     And this is � this is an internal RJR document?

24       A     Yes.  This is from Claude Teague, who's in charge

25   of new product development.  He's assistant to the R&D

1   director at this time, high-level executive at

2   R. J. Reynolds.  And this is what he was writing in 1973

3   about how to design cigarettes to capture a share of the

4   youth market.

5       Q     And according to Dr. Teague, in this document,

6   once a person becomes a regular smoker, there � the

7   free-to-choose aspect of it is a negative, is gone?

8       A     That's right.

9             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  If we could look up PT1265.

10       Q     And what was the William Esty Company?

11       A     This is the advertising firm for R. J. Reynolds.

12   They had done the surveys of youth in the 1950s, and here

13   they are again in the 1970s, talking about the NFO, the

14   national family opinion poll, which was Reynolds' national

15   tracking survey to assess who was smoking their brands

16   and � and competitor brands as well.

17       Q     And is this the only time that R. J. Reynolds

18   carefully studied which brands youth were smoking?

19       A     No, not at all.  I mean, this was constantly very

20   carefully tracked.  The Burrows document, that '84 document,

21   actually cites the NFO Camel studies and shows the overall

22   market share for different brands and then the market share

23   among the critical underage segment of the market, the

24   youth, you know, market, which was, I think, 14 to 24, as

25   it's defined here.

1       Q     And the top five brands account for 78.7 of the

2   total 14-to-20 market.

3       A     14 to 20 is what they're referring to, yes.

4       Q     And that's � one of those top five brands, that

5   includes Kools, correct?

6       A     Yes.  Kool, in the early '70s, was a very popular

7   brand.

8       Q     How about going back to the 1950s?

9       A     It was.  You know, menthol, became a very popular

10   brand because it was a starter product for a lot of young

11   people.

12             MR. PRYSOCK:  All right.  Let's go to PT1641.

13       Q     This is still from that same document we were just

14   talking about, PT1265.

15             "Many manufacturers have studied the 14-to-20

16   market in hopes of uncovering the secret of the instant

17   popularity some brands enjoy to the almost complete

18   exclusion of others, as shown above.  Creating a fad in this

19   market can be a great bonanza."

20             If -- if a company � based upon your research of

21   popularity of brands, if a company captures the youth

22   market, what happens to the success of that brand?

23       A    It grows because brand loyalties are established

24   at a young age.  So that brand stays popular for, you know,

25   a decade or more, and that's enormously important to the

1   companies.  It's critical to their business model to capture

2   a share of what they refer to as the replacement smoker

3   market.

4        Q     All right.  And we � when we looked at that Diane

5   Burrows document on Friday, retrospective of the last

6   50 years, the term was in there, "young adult smokers,"

7   right?

8        A     That's right.

9        Q     All right.  And in that document, they don't --

10   they don't specifically say youth.  They say "young adult"

11   and then they refer to studies going back to 12 years old,

12   right?

13              MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.

14              MR. PRYSOCK:  Strike that.  He's right.  My

15        apologies, Your Honor.

16   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

17        Q     In that document, do they use the term "YAS,"

18   young adult smokers?

19        A     They do.

20        Q     Okay.  Have you seen other documents where they

21   discuss what they mean by young adult smokers?

22        A     Yes.

23        Q     All right.

24                 A           I   mean,   NFO   is   down  to   age   14,   as   you   can   see

2        Q     And this is � is this -- whose � which company

3   is this document from � we're looking at now, which is

4   PT1641?

5        A     This is R. J. Reynolds.  This is to the board of

6   directors of R. J. Reynolds from Mr. Tucker, who was the

7   head of advertising at the time.  And he's laying out their

8   marketing plans for the upcoming year, in 1975.  The meeting

9   is September of 1974 in Hilton Head, where they held their

10   meeting of the board of directors.

11        Q     "First, let's look at the growing importance of

12   the young adult in the cigarette market.  In the 1960s, this

13   young adult market, the 14-to-24 age group represented

14   21 percent of the population.  As seen by this chart, they

15   will represent 27 percent of the population in 1975.  They

16   represent tomorrow's cigarette business.  As this 14-to-24

17   age group matures, they will account for a key share of the

18   total cigarette volume for at least the next 25 years."

19              And, Dr. Cummings, this market they're referring

20   to �

21              MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, first of all, is there

22        anything else?

23        Q     Did they, in fact, introduce the new product as --

24   after this meeting, designed to capture that part?

25        A     Yeah.  I mean, Camel cigarettes was reformulated,

1   as I mentioned, introduced under the Meet-the-Turk campaign.

2   So Camel had been a brand that had aged guite a bit.  They

3   put filters on Camels, and in the mid '70s, they reinvented

4   Camel, targeting young males predominantly.

5              And so that began at this meeting in 1974, when

6   they announced to the board of directors who that was going

7   to be targeting.

8        Q     Okay.

9              MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  Well, let's pull up another

10        document, talking about this young adult smoker, what

11        we're referring to, PT 1950.

12        Q     And this is a � says "1975"?

13        A     Yes.  This is the internal Brown & Williamson

14   document and their marketing department, Mr. Pittman, who

15   was in charge of their public affairs area, their marketing

16   department and talking about changing the words that they're

17   using in some of their documents at that time.

18        Q     "From time to time, when describing market

19   categories and target audiences, we use references such as

20    'young smokers,' 'young market,' 'youth market,' et cetera.

21   These terms do not accurately describe what we were talking

22        about.

23                               "In  the   future,   when   describing  the   low  age   end  of

24        the   cigarette  business,   please  use  the  term   'young  adult

1   members of your department that these terms should be used

2   in all written materials in the future."

3             And did you start -- when you looked at the youth

4   marketing documents, do you start to see this term become

5   more and more used after -- after this time frame?

6       A     Yes.  You find similar kinds of internal

7   memorandum for the other companies as well.  And they use

8   code terms, like FUBYAS, first usual brand, young adult

9   smoker, because it's really key to be the first brand that a

10   young person is buying.

11             MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  And let's look at another

12       example of what they're referring to, PT3220.

13       Q     And this is that same time frame?

14       A     Yes, it is.

15       Q     All right.  Which company is this?

16       A     This is Reynolds.

17       Q     "Primary goal, 1975 and ensuing years, is to

18   reestablish RJR's share of growth in the domestic cigarette

19   industry, increase our young adult franchise.  14-to-24 age

20   group in 1960 was 21 percent of the population, in 1975,

21   will be 27 percent.  As they mature, will account for a key

22   share of the cigarette volume for the next 25 years."

23             Is -- Dr. Cummings, in your experience, is a

24   14-year-old a young adult?

3             MR. PRYSOCK:  PT 1237.

4       Q     What year is this?

5       A     It's 1980.

6       Q     And, again, which company is this?

7       A     This is Reynolds.

8       Q     And -- and who was -- well, who are the

9   gentlemen -- gentleman writing this is who?

10       A     This is from Gerald Long, who I believe is the

11   president of the company, to Edward Horrigan, who was, I

12   think, in charge of marketing at that time, vice president.

13   He later becomes the president of R. J. Reynolds.

14       Q     That's Mr. Horrigan?

15       A     Yes.

16       Q     Okay.  We're going to keep that name in mind.

17             "MDD report on teenage smokers, 14 to 17.

20   share.  This latest report indicates that Philip Morris's

21   corporate share has increased by about 4 points.  However,

22   Marlboro remains the same at 52.

23             "Importantly, the report further indicates that

1   aid in some way in reducing or correcting these trends."

2             So at this time, what was happening as far as

3   R. J. Reynolds 14- to 17-year-old market share?

4       A     Well, they were losing to Philip Morris.

5   Philip Morris had dominated part of the market in the '70s

6   and they were concerned about it.  And they started

7   reformulating their products, including Winston.  Winston

8   was reformulated with the addition of elongation to the

9   manmade reconstituted tobacco.  That had been done earlier

10   with Camel in the mid '70s.

11       Q     And were there -- in this time frame, 1980 -- in

12   the 1980s, did they engage in various planned activities in

13   reducing � to aid in reducing or correcting this trend of

14   losing some 14- to 17-year-olds?

15       A     Yes.  They directed their marketing activities by

16   not only reformulating their brands, but they put new

17   emphasis on trying to attract new smokers to their brands,

18   young people, with, you know, marketing campaigns that were

19   directed, sponsorship of, you know, sporting events, like

20   soccer tournaments or soccer � professional soccer, I

21   think, in the early '80s.  They had NASCAR, of course, motor

22   track racing, you know, various kinds of coupons and

23   promotions that were done, massive amounts of billboard

24   advertising, particularly placed in communities that would

25   attract young people.

2       Q     Was R. J. Reynolds the only one that was engaged

3   in these activities to try to -- of � of making sure the

4   base of their � that their brands were specific to

5   teenagers?

6       A     No.  I mean, all the companies knew that it was

7   critical to the success of their business model to capture a

8   share of the young market.

9       Q     And who was this document from?

10       A     This is Lorillard, I believe 1978.  They were

11   talking about the growth of Newport menthol cigarettes,

12   which had grown rapidly and who they were really attracting

13   with their sales.  And this is the region, I believe, in the

14   New Brunswick area, New Jersey.

15       Q     And this PT is 2003.  "The base of our business is

16   the high school student."

17             And who is responsible for Lorillard?

18       A     R. J. Reynolds acguired Lorillard.

3   unified voice to The Tobacco Institute and would ask about

4   whether they market to young people or studied the smoking

5   habits of young people.  They said they do not.

6       Q     Okay.  And who is Anne Browder?

7       A     Anne Browder was a Tobacco Institute, you know,

8   public relations specialist.  And she would often appear on

9   local and national television and radio shows when asked to

10   give the tobacco industry's position on issues related to

11   smoking and health.

12       Q     When Ms. Browder -- and we're about to see a clip

13   here.  When she was speaking on behalf of the TI -- or The

14   Tobacco Institute, also known as TI, was she speaking for

15   R. J. Reynolds?

16       A     Yes.

17       Q     Was the TI their official public � was it the TI

18   organization that officially made public statements on

19   behalf of R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, Lorillard and

20   Philip Morris?

21       A     Yes.

22       Q     And who paid for The Tobacco Institute?  Who

23   funded The Tobacco Institute?

24       A     It was the cigarette manufacturers so

4       PT1683Q.

5       Q     Is this Ms. Browder?

6       A     Yes.  This is 1983.

7       Q     Okay.  1983?

8       A     October 1983, Anne Browder was � appeared on the

9   show 20/20, and, in fact, representatives from the cigarette

10   companies had been asked to appear and answer questions

11   about marketing their products to young people and ask --

12   answer questions about issues related to smoking and health.

13   And the companies appointed Anne Browder to speak on their

14   behalf.

21       talk to the Tobacco Institute.  The institute said Anne

22       Browder would speak for them.

don't know.

"UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  How can you say it might not be harmful, yet most of the people who die of lung cancer smoke?  I mean, how can you not be aware of that?

"MS. BROWDER:  Well, the fact that people die on a daily basis, some of them are smokers and some of them are non-smokers.  But further, it's challenging that cigarette smoking isn't about custom, that one should not even consider until they've reached the age of maturity.

"UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  What's maturity?

"MS. BROWDER:  Anywhere around the age of 21.  The cigarette manufacturers are not interested in obtaining new business from teenagers in our society.

"UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  How can you stay in business if you can't hook the kids?

"MS. BROWDER:  We've been in business very well, thank you, for some time now without attempting to hook kids.  We do everything possible to discourage teenage smoking.

24   placement in movies like Superman II?

25       A           Yeah.  I've seen the documentation that indicates

1   that Philip Morris paid for that product placement in a

2   movie, Superman II.

3       Q     How about other movies?

4       A     Yeah.  All the -- you know, many of the cigarette

5   manufacturers, certainly Reynolds, has done product

6   placements in movies.  So Brown & Williamson, I think they

7   hired Sylvester Stallone.  They placed products in five of

8   the films that he helped produce.

9       Q     How did he � how did they pay him for that?  Do

10   you remember?

11       A     Well, with Sylvester Stallone, the documents

12   indicate that he was paid in cash or gifts.  So they didn't

13   want checks, I guess.

14       Q     Is this the only time the tobacco industry has

15   made public statements about whether they market to kids?

16       A     No.  They made comments frequently and repeatedly

17   that they don't market to kids.  That's what their public

18   position has always been.

19             MR. PRYSOCK:  And if we can pull up one more,

22   those documents from him.  But who is Ed Horrigan?  Who was

23   he at the time he made this statement?

24       A     Well, this is � I think the 20/20 � or no.  This

3              "MR. KOPPEL:  Should we not be leading our

4        children in the direction of not smoking?

5              "MR. HORRIGAN:  Yes.  In fact, as part of that

6        last thing, yes.  The cigarette industry's position is

7        that young people should not smoke.  Now, as long as it

8        is an open guestion � and I say an open guestion and as

9        long as science continues independent research to get at

10        the answers, then we believe that people should wait

11        until they are, let's say, young adults and make that

12        informed decision.

1       A     Yes.  R. J. Reynolds, when they took over Newport

2   and launched, you know, couponing � you're not allowed to

3   do free samples anymore, but they're handing out coupons so

4   you can turn it in for $1 and buy a pack.  They have the two

5   18-wheeler vans that show up at rock concerts and youth

7   and people can turn them in and get, you know, their

Page 1488 MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, if � I was about to ask the

next guestion which will establish the relevance.

Camel Crush has targeted to young people, in the design

of it and how it's smoked.  And that's -- that's all I'm

going to ask him about.  It's continuing course of

conduct.

MR. WALKER:  It didn't exist during Mr. Price's lifetime.  If it's relevant at all in this trial, it'll be in the second phase.

THE COURT:  And why isn't he correct about that?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Because it goes to the reprehensibility, the continuing course of conduct. We've had this argument multiple times.  The Court has ruled multiple times on it.  It is simply a matter, they're still doing it today.

It goes towards the need for deterrence and punishment, which is a Phase I decision by the jury. Then in Phase II will be the amount as it specifically relates to that conduct.

MR. WALKER:  Actually, the standard jury instruction does not permit them to go beyond the conduct that harmed Mr. Price or at a minimum, the type of conduct that harmed Mr. Price.  They have not establish either of those for Camel Crush and they can't.

Page   1489 THE   COURT:      Objection's   sustained.

I'm � I want to talk real quickly about the composite exhibit that was reviewed by Dr. Cummings. What's your continued objection?

MR. WALKER:  So when we were at sidebar, I raised an objection that he hadn't laid a foundation for those documents by describing the time period for them.  Then he -- he addressed that for some of what's in the notebook.  I haven't seen the notebook.  But he addressed it for most � I guess some part for Kool, some part of Pall Mall and some part of Winston.

I believe that they have other advertisements for other brands that were probably never discussed at any point in Dr. Cummings' presentation, and I don't think that a foundation has been laid for those, even under the ruling that Your Honor made at sidebar.

THE COURT:  Okay.  It's � it's admissible.  And it can be marked at the appropriate time.

MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  We'll be in recess.  Thank you.

MR. MITNIK:  Just � just so I make the record, our juror was dozing again.

THE COURT:  I � I was going to bring that up.  He

10        audio of video clip(s) to the best of my ability.

11        However, oftentimes, the audio from the video clips

17        people hearing different things.

18             As such, I will do my best to transcribe this

THE BAILIFF:  I just have a suggestion.

THE COURT:  No, I'm just going to do it that way.  That way it doesn't bring up anything with the jury and everything, and then he'll just know not to come back.

THE BAILIFF:  Remember when you seated them, you didn't tell them you were seating them in order of so and so.  Why don't we just dismiss him at the end as an alternate?

THE COURT: I understand. But what I'm going to do, I'm going to want to, just this evening, if you'll just call him.  He'll be the third one.

What's his name?

MR. WALKER:  Douglas, Maurice Douglas.

Yeah, he was sleeping again, and, you know, I don't know why, but there's no question.

18   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

19       Q    Sir, we've talked some about the 1964 Surgeon

20   General Report.

21             First of all, how did it come about that the

22   Surgeon General of the United States was asked in the

23   early 1960s to look into the question of � of smoking

24   and lung disease?

25       A    Well, the way it came about was John F.

1   Kennedy, President Kennedy, had been asked in a news

2   conference about a similar report that had come out from

3   England, the Royal College of Physicians report on

4   smoking and health which came out in the spring of 1962.

5   And in a press event, I think it was in May of '62, a

6   reporter asked him about what the president's thoughts

7   were about this new report indicating cigarette smoking

8   was a cause of lung cancer and what the United States

9   was doing about it, and he � he punted the question.

10   He basically said, I don't know about the report.

11            And two weeks later, Luther Terry, who was

12   Surgeon General, announced the formation of the advisory

13   committee that then deliberated and eventually came out

14   with the report in 1964.

15       Q    And was President Kennedy a cigarette smoker?

16       A    He was.

17       Q    How about his wife?

18       A    I don't know about his wife.  Sorry.

19       Q    Okay.  That's all right.

20             So prior to the � the 1964 report coming out

21   where they looked at the issue of smoking and whether it

22   caused lung disease, did the � did the Surgeon General

23   ask the cigarette makers, the people who made the

24   product, did they ask them to turn over their internal

25   research about what they knew?

1       A    Yes.  I mean, there was � I mean, obviously it

2   was a big deal that there was going to be an advisory

3   committee.  In fact, the companies were able to work

4   with the government to make sure that they would have a

5   committee that was completely neutral on the issue.

6            And all the companies were asked to turn over

7   all relevant research internally, any kinds of

8   conclusions, findings, that would be relevant to the

9   committee's deliberation in advance of the report coming

10   out.  Those came out, I think, in the spring � those

11   letters to the companies, in the spring of 1963.

12       Q    Okay.  And in response, did the companies give

13   some information to the government?

14       A    They did.  You know, there was some information

15   that was presented and other information we now know

16   that was withheld.

17       Q    Okay.  And let's look at a couple of things

18   that were not presented.

19            MR. PRYSOCK:  First of all, if we could pull up

20       PT3681.

21   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

22       Q    This is Philip Morris, and you've seen this

23   document before.  Who is � I assume you've seen this

24   document before. 2 5       A    I have.

1       Q    And who was Dr. Wakeham?

2       A    He was the �

3            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I have an objection to

4       this document.  This is one of the category that we

5       addressed previously of Philip Morris documents.

6             THE COURT:  Come to sidebar.

7             (Sidebar was held outside the hearing of the

8   jury:)

9            MR. WALKER:  � purpose that they want to use

10       it for are not statements made in furtherance of the

11       conspiracy, Your Honor's ruling pretrial was to

12       defer it to trial pending a foundation.  This

13       document, I don't think, was distributed to Reynolds

14       or any of the companies that Reynolds was

15       responsible for, and so that's why I have the

16       objection.  I think for all of these documents, I

17       made the reguest previously that they not just be

18       put up on the screen before a foundation was laid

19       and I have a chance to object to it.

2 0                           THE COURT:  How many of the non-Reynolds or

21       Reynolds �

22            MR. PRYSOCK:  There's only just a couple.  And

23        I will make sure I'll give them a chance to make

24        sure.  But I � you know, I was about to lay the

25       foundation.  The Court's already ruled on this.

1       This is a co-conspirator.  I have to show what the

2       other co-conspirator's knowledge was because they

3       together agreed to suppress this information.  So I

4       have to show that they each knew it because, if one

5       had told it, then the conspiracy wouldn't work.

6            MR. WALKER:  The last document where this issue

7        came up, Your Honor, you did allow the document but

8       you required it to be made clear that the document

9       was not distributed to Reynolds.  And that may well

10       be your ruling again here, but I need to be able to

11       object before the document is shown.

12             THE COURT:  I gotcha.  That's fair.  In fact,

13       if you've got some of these documents, show it to

14       him in advance before you put it up.

15            MR. PRYSOCK:  I'll do it, Your Honor.

16             THE COURT:  But on that, I do want to establish f

17       we aren't going to wait for, you know, hours and

18       hours that this � there's no evidence that it was

19       distributed to R. J. Reynolds. 2 0                            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

21            MR. WALKER:  Thank you, Your Honor.

2             Is this which company?

3       A    Philip Morris.

4       Q    Was Philip Morris one of the co-conspirators

5   along with R. J. Reynolds in suppressing what they knew

6   internally about the health effects of smoking?

7       A    Yes.

8       Q    Okay.  And is this an internal Philip Morris

9   document?

10       A    Yes, it is.

11       Q    So why are we looking at this as far as an

12   internal document of Philip Morris if it's not an

13   R. J. Reynolds document as far as what collectively they

14   knew?

15       A    Well, for two reasons.  One, it's consistent

16   with the findings from Dr. Rodgman, a document that we

17   had shown in 1959 that is a Reynolds document where

18   Dr. Rodgman concluded they couldn't remove all the

19   carcinogens from cigarettes as long as it burned at a

20   hot temperature, which of course cigarettes do.  When

21   you light it and you're puffing on it, it's well over

22   700 degrees centigrade.

23            And, secondly, because the companies

24   collectively through the Tobacco Institute, through

25   other statements of the Tobacco Industry Research

1   Committee, repeatedly made the statement:  If there's

2   anything harmful in cigarettes, we can remove it.

3            And these two documents indicate � the one in

4    '59, now another one from Philip Morris, will show that

5   they knew that they could not take all of the harmful

6   chemicals out of the product.

7       Q    And Philip Morris through the TI, after this

8   document, did they publicly state:  If there is anything |

9   wrong, we will take it out?

10       A    Yes.  That was a statement that was made almost

11   over 45 years that the conspiracy went on.

12             THE COURT:  Dr. Cummings, it's my understanding |

13       this last document, however, was not distributed to

14       R. J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, Lorillard, or

15       any of those; is that correct?

1   just one company had disclosed this information

2   publicly, what would have happened to the conspiracy?

3       A    It would have fallen apart.  I mean, if one of

4   the companies said, No, we can't remove all the harmful

5   chemicals and make cigarettes safe, then the cat would

6   have been out of the bag.  And none of them did that.

10       Q    Dr. Wakeham, a scientist, again, at Philip

11   Morris?

12       A    Not just a scientist.  He was head of R&D at

13   this time.

14       Q    Okay.                                                                                                f

18   also identified as carcinogens.

20       A    Chemicals that cause cancer.

21       Q    Okay.  And is this a complete list of all the

22   chemicals that cause cancer in cigarettes?

23       A    No.  This is a partial list that had been

24   identified from published literature.  And they put plus

25   signs next to the chemicals based on the potency of the

1   chemical causing tumors in animals, which was the

2   methodology for assessing whether a chemical was a

3   carcinogen or not.

4       Q    All right.  And a couple of these �

5   benzo(a)pyrene � I can say that one, so benzo(a)pyrene,

6   the head of research and development at Philip Morris in

7   1961, what did he say about that one as far as the

8   potency of causing cancerous tumors?

9       A    Based on the evidence at the time, you know,

10   there was actually � it describes a rating scale for

11   these plus signs.  Obviously highly potent because it

12   gets three or four plus signs.

13            But these are all carcinogens identified and

14   isolated in cigarette smoke, so you're seeing over time

15   they're getting better at the isolation of the

16   chemicals.  Today it's 9,000 chemicals in every puff of

17   a cigarette.

18       Q    All right.

2             Present filtration does not permit selective

3   filtration of a particulate smoke.

4            And � well, let's hold that and I'll ask the

5   question in a moment.  Okay?

6            Okay.  When they're talking about filtration

7   and particulates, what are they talking about?

8       A    Well �                                                                                           |

9       Q    What do particulates mean?

10       A    Yeah.  Particulates are tar.  And they're

11   talking about the specific carcinogens that are found in |

12   the tar.  The particulates that you get, the by-products

13   when you light a cigarette and burn the matter and push

14   the � pull the smoke through the � through the tobacco |

15   and then through the filter, you're still getting

16   particulates coming out the other end and you're

17   inhaling those then.

18             They can't remove through selective filtration

19   specific chemicals to reduce the carcinogens in tobacco

20   because there are too many of them.  There are

21   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  They identify a whole

22   series of other chemicals including heavy metals,

23   arsenic, for example, cadmium identified in tobacco

24   smoke, as well as other chemical compounds besides the

25   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

1       Q    Okay.  Now, let's look over what they � let's

2   look at what they did turn over to the Surgeon General

3   just prior to the 1964 report.

4            MR. PRYSOCK:  If we can look at PT2817.

5   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

6       Q    And this is 1963, and who is it to?

7       A    This is James Hundley.  Dr. Hundley was the

8   assistant Surgeon General.  He was the one that had sent

9   out the invitations to the companies to, you know, share

10   their data.

11            And this is the cover letter from Philip Morris

12   with their submission to the committee.

13       Q    Okay.

14             From a review of the large amassed published

15   literature, we have prepared and submit herewith a

16   compendium of chemical constituents in tobacco and

17   smoke?

18             So did they submit what was already available

19   publicly?

20       A    Yes.

21       Q    So � and then � and then we just saw

22   Dr. Wakeham, what he's saying internally, now let's read

23   on:

24             None of the chemicals/substances listed

25   therein, to our knowledge, have been found by scientific

3             It is possible, of course, to modify the

6            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I'm sorry to

7        interrupt, but I have to ask, again, these

8       preambles:  We just saw Dr. Wakeham, what he's

9       saying internally.  Let's read on.

10             I have to object to that and ask that that be

11       discontinued.

12             THE COURT:  You're talking about the way the

13       question was phrased?

14            MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.

15             THE COURT:  No, I understand.

16            MR. WALKER:  Thank you.

1   was a Philip Morris document, 1961.

2       Q    All right.  And then we have this one to the

4             It is possible, of course, to modify the

5   chemical composition of cigarette smoke by the use of

6   filters.

7             Is that consistent � what they told the

8   Surgeon General, is that consistent with what their head

9   of research and development told them internally?

10       A    No.  It's inconsistent with what they knew

11   internally, that they couldn't remove all the harmful

12   chemicals in the cigarette smoke.

13       Q    Okay.  And then in the top part here on this

14   display, we have what he said internally, which is:

15            Present technology does not permit selective

16   filtration of particulate smoke.

20   this is from that prior document with Dr. Wakeham:

1   through other respiratory complications.  A number of

2   experts have predicted that the cigarette industry

3   ultimately may be in greater trouble in this area than

4   in the lung cancer field.

5            What was happening to emphysema as far as �

6   we've looked at the lung cancer curves.  When did

7   emphysema start rising dramatically in the United

8   States?                                                                                                               |

9       A    It corresponds to the rise in � in � in lung

10   cancer deaths, actually, in this country, but people

11   often will live a longer time with emphysema and so you

12   don't see the mortality effects so directly as you do

13   with lung cancer.  Because when you're diagnosed with

14   lung cancer, the life-expectancy is so short, whereas

15   with emphysema, somebody may live for a decade or more

16   with that disease even though it's highly debilitating.

17       Q    Was there any discussion by the tobacco

18   companies publicly about emphysema, the industry being

19   in greater trouble in the area of emphysema than lung 2 0        cancer?

21       A    Not publicly.  Publicly they reassured the

22   public that there was no evidence that cigarette smoking |

23   was harmful to health or caused any � was proven to

24   cause any harm to human health.  That was their position f

1   1990s.  They didn't change that position.  Reynolds did

2   not change that position until after 2000.

3       Q    Okay.  So after this, though, the Surgeon

4   General report did come out.  And when was that?

5       A    January 11th, 1964.

6       Q    And was it a � was it a big deal at the time?

7       A    Yes.

8       Q    In the news?  It was on all the news?

9       A    It got covered � I think we showed a clip of

10   Howard Cullman appearing on CBS.  And all the major

11   networks, ABC, CBS, NBC, ran special shows reporting the

12   results of the Surgeon General's report.

13       Q    So after the � after the Surgeon Generals

14   report comes out in 1964, the members of the conspiracy,

15   R. J. Reynolds, Philip Morris, Lorillard, Brown &

16   Williamson, and the others, at that point did they

17   publicly admit the Surgeon General is correct; it � we

18   do know internally that cigarette smoking causes lung

19   diseases?

2 0       A    No.

21            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  This has

1       Q    Okay.  Did they at least � did they stop

5            Did they stop putting out their

6   counter-message at this point that it wasn't � did they |

7   at least not say anything more about it?

8       A    No.  They doubled down on the messaging that

9   they had been putting out, which was denying the risks,

10   and spent more money, actually, to get that message out.

11       Q    So after the '64 Surgeon General report came

12   out, have you seen what were formerly secret documents

13   where they discuss the effect and what they were going

14   to do?

19       Q    And what's significant about this date?  What 2 0       had just happened?

21       A    Well, this is just a couple weeks after the

22   Surgeon General's report has come out, and George

23   Weissman, who's on the communications committee of the

1   committee of the Tobacco Institute, and they're talking

2   about, you know, what the effect of the report had been

3   and what they need to be doing in terms of public

4   relations going forward.

5       Q    Some of my thoughts regarding the recent

6   release of the Surgeon General's report:

7            While the propaganda blast was tremendous and

8   the penetration of public opinion very widespread, I

10   severe, nor did it have the emotional depth I might have

11   feared.

12             The restraint and unity of the industry has

13   been very effective in this period.  The opponents have

14   had their inning.  The industry has demonstrated its

15   seriousness and responsibility in saying we would study

16   the report.

17            And based upon reading this entire document and

18   what had just happened at this time, who is the opponent

19   that he's referring to?

20       A    The Surgeon General.

21       Q    If we go back to the Frank Statement, which was

22   the first public statement by the cigarette industry in

23   1954 after the TIRC was formed, what did they say

24   publicly they were going to do regarding public health

25   and working with them?

3            And the question I was going to ask you about

4   that is is this a continued theme by the companies,

5   including R. J. Reynolds, that it's just a matter of

6   free choice and it has nothing to do with addiction,

7   continued smoking?

8       A    Well, publicly �

9            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor, as to the

10       word "theme."  This is just an internal document.  I

11       don't know what theme he's referring to.

12            MR. PRYSOCK:  I �

19   publicly that cigarettes are not addictive, it's just a

20   matter of personal choice?

21       A    Yes.  That was their public position.

22       Q    And have you seen internal documents where they |

23   discuss what they really are � they discuss behind the

5   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

6       Q    And who are these gentlemen?

7       A    Well, Mr. Blalock is in the marketing and

8   public relations arm of Brown & Williamson, and Ernie

9   Pebbles is the chief general counsel.  He's replaced

10   Addison Yeaman as chief general counsel of Brown &

11   Williamson.

12        Q    And who is responsible for Brown & Williamson?

13       A    R. J. Reynolds.

14        Q    Addiction:  To some extent the argument

15   revolving around free choice is being negated on the

16   grounds of addiction.  The threat is that this argument

17   will increase significantly and lead to further

18   restrictions on product specifications and greater

19   danger in litigation.

20             Is that consistent with what he was saying

21   earlier and what the other gentleman was saying earlier

22   about it being just a matter of choice and not

23   addiction?

2 4       A    No.

2       A    Right.  This was internal to the � to the

3   company, not shared with the public.

4       Q    All right.  So after the Surgeon General report

5   of 1964, what happened to cigarette sales around that

6   time, you know, briefly?

7       A    For two months, in January and February,

8   cigarette sales actually were reduced.  And then they

9   rebounded again, and cigarette sales went up for the

10   remainder of the year and the following year.

11       Q    And is there � have you seen documents where

12   they discuss the fact � or what was happening with

13   cigarette smokers and new smokers?

14       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

18       Q    All right.  So 1966 you said sales continued

2   packs.

3       Q    And you said cautionary.  Why do you call it a

4   cautionary label?

5       A    Because that's what it was.  It said:

6            Caution:  Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to

7   your health.

8       Q    Who was responsible for getting the word "may"

10       A    Well, the actual �

12             THE COURT:  Overruled.

13       A    Yeah.  The actual language for the law that was

14   passed by Congress was written by the lawyers for the

15   cigarette companies.  They met the Monday after the

16   Surgeon General's report had come out, so on January

17   13th.  They drafted the legislation that was adopted,

18   and they did that for purposes of mitigating warnings

19   coming out from states.  So � and they made a less 2 0       impactful warning.

21       Q    Based upon your own research, Dr. Cummings,

22   with people with addiction, how does a � watering down

23   a message with things like may compare to a strong,

24   consistent message when we're dealing with a

9            MR. PRYSOCK:  On what a psychological crutch

10       is?  As far as addicted smokers, he studied them.

11       He studied their behavior �

12             THE COURT:  I understand, but you're asking him |

13       to give an opinion as to the effect of � is his

14       background psychology?

15            MR. PRYSOCK:  No.  It's a variety of things,

16       epidemiology � he's also gotten multiple grants to

17        study smoking behaviors and addiction.  And I can go |

18       through all of that, but he is clearly � there is

19       no objection to him being qualified on this aspect, 2 0                 I think.

21             But so the question, Your Honor, is how does

22       giving a person who is addicted a mixed message

23       about whether something � versus a clear and

24        consistent message.  I mean, this is the crux of the

9       Q    We were talking about the caution labels that

10   came on in 1966.

11             That following year, are there studies that

12   were done and reports that were done to show whether the

13   caution label had any effect on � on deterring people

14   from continuing to smoke?

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    And are you familiar with the FTC report from

17   1967?

18       A    I am.

19       Q    And the FTC report � I think you talked about

20   it a little bit before, but just � what was that again,

21   FTC?

22       A    Federal Trade Commission.  And they were

23   required by Congress to put out a report on cigarette

24   advertising and also talk about the effects of educating

25   the public about the risks of smoking, including the new

1   warning labels which they did in the '67 report.

2            MR. PRYSOCK:  All right.  And if we can look at

3       that PT3870 from 1967.

4   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

5       Q    The effectiveness of cigarette labeling.

6            And is that the cautionary label that went on

7   cigarettes?

8       A    Yes, it is.

9       Q    On the side of the pack, right?

10       A    Correct.

11       Q    There is virtually no evidence that the warning

12   statement on cigarette packages has had any significant

13   effect.

14             One finds that in 1966 more cigarettes were

15   sold than ever before.  Even during January and February

16   1966, the first two months that the warnings appeared on

17   cigarette packages, cigarette sales were higher than

18   they had been during the same months of the preceding

19   year.

20             Thus, cigarette sales have continued to

21   increase each year except for 1964, when they declined

22   by 10.7 billion or about 2 percent.

23            As noted above, the decline in 1964 is probably

24   due to the publicity that accompanied the publication of

25   the report of the Surgeon General's advisory committee.

1             In 1965 sales continued their upward swing by

2    jumping 16 billion, about 3.1 percent, and in 1966 they

3   reached a new all-time high of 539 billion units.

4             Now, they're talking about a new all-time high.

5   They mean in the history of cigarette sales?

6       A    Yes.

7       Q    So the � that was the year after the warning

8   labels went on packs?

9       A    Correct.

10       Q    And do they also discuss what they attribute

11   that to now, due in part to the cumulative effect of

12   cigarette advertising over the years, advertising that

13   shows cigarette smoking to be an enjoyable and

14   pleasurable activity, et cetera �

15            Actually, I believe we talked about this

16   yesterday?

17             But what do they attribute � let me ask you

18   this:  At this time how � how pervasive was cigarette

19   advertising in the country?

20       A    It was like wallpaper:  You couldn't escape it.

21   It was virtually everywhere in every form of media.  If

22   you were walking, seeing, reading, you were getting

23   exposed to cigarette advertising. 2 4       Q    And we talked about:

1   Americans who can either read or understand the spoken

2   word.  So pervasive is cigarette advertising, it is

3   virtually impossible for Americans of almost any age to

4   avoid cigarette advertising.

5             Is that what you were just talking about?

6       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

7       Q    Okay.  We've talked about the position the

8   companies were taking publicly at this time as being at

9   odds with the Surgeon General.

10             Have you seen documents where internally they

11   discuss concerns about that public position?

12       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

16   speaking on behalf � or the Tobacco Institute was the

17   industry's � what was the Tobacco Institute?

18       A    Well, they were their trade association, but

19   they also spoke on issues related to smoking and health

20   on behalf of their members, the cigarette manufacturers.

21       Q    All right.

22       A    And this is a memo from William Kloepfer, vice

1       Q    And was this a document that was only

2   discovered years later?

3       A    Yes.  This is one of the internal documents

4   that got turned over to me when the Tobacco Institute

5   internal documents came to Roswell Park.

6       Q    Our basic position in the cigarette controversy

7   is subject to the charge and may be subject to a finding

8   that we are making false or misleading statements to

9   promote the sale of cigarettes.

10             Cigarette controversy � was there a

11   controversy at that time as to whether cigarette � at

12   least in the public health eyes as to whether or not

13   cigarette smoking was causing lung disease?

14       A    There was no controversy even within the

15   companies internally.  As you saw, they all agreed that

16   cigarette smoking caused lung cancer in 1958.

17       Q    And where did this controversy that he's

18   referring to come about?

19       A    Well, they're really the public relations, the

20   public stance that the companies had put out that said

21   that cigarette smoking hadn't been proven to cause any

22   harm to human health.  And then the Surgeon General and

23   others involved in public health clearly knew otherwise

24   and were trying to educate the public that it was quite

25   harmful to smoke.

1        Q    Despite this concern as voiced in this

2   memorandum, did the companies continue to promote that

3   controversy publicly?

4       A    Yes.  Primarily through the Tobacco Institute,

5   which was their arm putting out this false controversy

6   about the -- you know, that it wasn't proven that

7   cigarette smoking caused any harm.

8             MR. PRYSOCK:  If we can look at PT2050.

9   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

10        Q    For nearly 20 years this industry has employed

11   a single strategy to defend itself on three major

12   fronts:  litigation, politics and public opinion.

13             And what year is this document?

14       A    1972.

15        Q    Okay.  And he's talking about for nearly 20

16   years.  What does that go back to?

17       A    That goes back to the establishment of the

18   controversy -- you know, the conspiracy hatched at the

19   Plaza Hotel.

20        Q    And who are these gentlemen?  I forgot to ask

21   you.

22       A    Fred Panzer is the vice president at the

1   Institute.  So it's two high-level people within the

2   Tobacco Institute.

3       Q    And this is marked confidential; is that right?

4       A    That's right.

5       Q    While the strategy was brilliantly conceived

6   and executed over the years, helping us win important

7   battles, it is only fair to say that it is not, nor was

8   it intended to be, a vehicle for victory.  On the

9   contrary, it has always been a holding strategy

10   consisting of creating doubt about the health charge

11   without actually denying it.

12             Based upon your review of the documents, how

13   did they go about creating doubt?

14       A    Well, they created doubt by essentially denying

15   that the evidence had proven that cigarette smoking was

16   a cause to harm, reassuring smokers that they were doing

17   research into the allegations that cigarette smoking was

18   harmful to health when, in fact, most of that research

19   had nothing to do with smoking and health whatsoever.

20   And, you know, this constant drumbeat of having their

21   paid public relations people � like Anne Browder we saw

22   appear on local and national shows, putting out White

23   Papers which they reestablished in 1968 and would issue

24   the day before the Surgeon General's report, you know,

25   then denying that cigarette smoking was harmful.

1             It was a massive public relations campaign that

2   cost the companies collectively over a billion dollars.

3       Q    Did you say B?

4       A    Yeah, a billion dollars is what they spent.  I

5   have all the budgets for TIRC and the Tobacco Institute,

6   and you add them up, it's over a billion dollars.

7       Q    And you mentioned research, and we've talked �

8   we've heard a couple times about CTR, the � Council For

9   Tobacco Research; is that right?

10       A    That's right.

11       Q    All right.  And how � how was that vehicle �

12            And, first of all, the name had been changed,

13   right?

14       A    Right.  In March of 1964, they did a name

15   change, and the Tobacco Industry Research Committee was

16   renamed the Council For Tobacco Research.  It was the

17   same organization, same structure, with the executives

18   from the companies as the executive committee, and the

19   chief general counsels that ran the law committee for

20   both TIRC and the Tobacco Institute, they were

21   identical.  So they vetted every word that came out.

22       Q    And did they fund some research from supposedly

23   independent scientists?

24       A    They did.  Some of the research was quite good.

25   Basic science research.  I think they even funded, you

1   know, academic institutions here in Florida, Nobel Prize

2   winners.  But it did not have to do with the issue of

3   whether cigarette smoking was a cause of human disease,

4   which is what they told the Department of Justice in

5   1954 would be the only focus of that organization and

6   that they would provide factual information to the

7   American public.  That was the limits of power when they

8   incorporated the organization and told the Department of

9   Justice exactly what the organization was about.

12   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

13       Q    Are you familiar with this document?

14       A    Yeah.  This is an internal Brown & Williamson

15   document, again in the � I think 1969 period.  They're

16   talking about smoking and health issues and how to

17   counteract the massive information that's coming out

18   from the public health community on the dangers of

19   smoking.

2 0       Q    And let's see . . .

21             Doubt is our product, since it is the best

22   means of competing with the body of fact that exists in

23   the mind of general public.  It is also the means of

1   establishing or creating a controversy?

2       A    Yes.  That was the purpose as was described in

3   the forwarding memo that reassures smokers in 1953, you

4   know, when they sort of hatched the scheme, and that was

5   the continuing effort that they described.  This one is

6   1969, the TI one creating doubt.  That was 1972.

15   about their plan for keeping people smoking?

16       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

17       Q    Same time frame.  Again, who is this?

18       A    This is from Mr. Thompson at Hill & Knowlton.

19   He's writing to William Kloepfer at the Tobacco

20   Institute, vice president of the Tobacco Institute,

21   about a health news letter that they would � the

22   smoking and health newsletter that they sent out to

23   editorial boards, to hospitals, medical doctors,

24   essentially all challenging evidence linking cigarette

25   smoking and disease.

1             He's talking about the criteria for identifying

2   things that would appear in this � this news public �

3   monthly public news publication they put out.

4       Q    The most important type of story is that which

5   casts doubt on the cause-and-effect theory of disease

6   and smoking.

7             Thus, the headline should carefully call out

8   the point controversy, contradiction, other factors,

9   unknowns.

10            Are those consistent themes from

11   representatives of the tobacco industry in that time

12   frame and going forward:  there's controversy, there's

13   contradiction in the science, other factors cause lung

14   disease, and it's unknown?

15       A    Correct.  That's what you see in these

16   newsletters which were really just compiling anything

17   that would challenge the link between smoking and

18   disease.  And they would blow it up and try to give it a

19   megaphone.

20             So that was the message that people were

21   getting.  And they would try to reach opinion leaders,

22   like doctors and editorial writers, with that message so

23   they would carry it forward to the public.

24       Q    And let me talk about the Council For Tobacco

25   Research funding people and scientists.

1             Have you seen documents where they internally

2   discuss what they were doing as far as funding science?

3       A    Yes.  They � well, they said it was going to

4   be � publicly they said it was to be independent

5   scientists selected and reviewed by an esteemed

6   scientific advisory board, which they had.  They set up

7   an advisory board and so on.

8             But they also funded a category of studies or

9   projects called special projects which were selected by

10   the lawyers for the cigarette companies basically to

11   create a science that would contradict the evidence

12   coming out implicating cigarette smoking was a cause of

13   disease.  And those weren't vetted by scientists.  They

14   were selected by the lawyers.

15       Q    And let me ask you about that as far as how

16   that worked with the conspiracy.

17            At some point later on, have you seen polls

18   where people were asked who would they trust most as far |

19   as opinions � opinions about smoking and health?

2 0       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

21       Q    And then towards the bottom of that list, at

22   some point later on in time, was it � it was tobacco

23   company executives were towards the bottom of that list,

2 4        correct?                                                                                                                 f

1   funded the scientists through special projects, because

2   then they would give them the megaphone, so it wasn't

3   appearing to come from the cigarette companies.  It

4   appeared to be coming from leading scientists, which

5   they knew would have more credibility in terms of the

6   public.  Obviously the public was sceptical about a �

7   you know, the cigarette company's � what they had to

8   say.  So they created their own spokespeople through the

9   funding of special projects.

10       Q    Have you seen internally where they even talk

11   about this, the real purpose of CTR?

12       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

13       Q    And now just to be clear, publicly what were

14   they saying the purpose of CTR was?

15       A    To study the allegations that cigarette smoking |

16   caused disease and to provide factual information to the

17   American public.

1   present, as well as chief general counsel from American

2   Tobacco and Brown & Williamson, as well as some

3   scientists.  I think this memo is written by

4   Mr. Seligman, the notes of the meeting.  He's from

5   Philip Morris.

6       Q    All right.  At the outset, Arnold Henson

7   reminded all participants of the meeting that there

8   should be no written record of what transpired issued

9   for distribution.

10             CTR began as an organization called Tobacco

11   Industry Research Council, TIRC.  It was set up as an

12   industry shield in 1954.

13             Is there anything in The Frank Statement or

14   anything where they're talking publicly about CTR where

15   they say it was set up as a shield?

16       A    No, not publicly.

17       Q    CTR has helped our legal counsel by giving

18   advice and technical information which was needed at

19   court trials.  CTR has supplied spokesmen for the

20   industry at congressional hearings.  The monies spent at

21   CTR provides a base for introduction of witnesses.

22             Bill Shinn feels that special projects are the

23   best way that monies are spent.  On these projects, CTR

24   has acted as a front.

1   anywhere publicly where they talk about CTR being a

2   front?

3       A    No.

4       Q    Publicly did they call it independent science

5   by independent scientists?

6       A    Publicly they said it was independent.  They

7   did talk about the fact that many of the scientists that

8   they were funding were on their payroll and those were

9   the people that appeared in the White Papers that they

10   put out.

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  All right.  One more, PT1544.

15       Q    And 1978.  Who is it from?  Or . . .

16       A    This is Ernie Pepples to various folks within

17   Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company, essentially at the

18   same time period talking about the role of CTR and their

19   funding of CTR.

20       Q    Originally CTR was organized as a public

21   relations effort.  The industry told the world CTR would

22   look at diseases which were being associated with

23   smoking.  There was even a suggestion by our political

24   spokesmen that, if a harmful element turned up, the

25   industry would try to root it out.

4            Who is Jensen?  What was his background or what

5   did he do?

6       A    Well, Jensen was one of the special project

7   scientists funded by the cigarette companies and was

8   used to � you know, for doing congressional hearings

9   for them.

10       Q    Shook Hardy pro- � and congressional hearings

11   where they talked about the continuing controversy of

12   smoking and health?

13       A    That's correct.

14       Q    And that the causes of disease weren't known?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    Shook Hardy proposes to give them $40,000, not

17   for specific research � he's currently working on a

18   vaccine for human pathaloma � or with an eye to

19   publication but solely in order to maintain a good

20   relationship with him and secure his continued help in

21   making contact with other scientists.

1   Jensen money to keep him happy and that there is no

2   immediate value to his research.

3             Have you seen other documents where the

4   scientists who were, at least publicly, saying there's

5   no cause between smoking � the link between smoking and |

6   health is not proven, where privately they were being

7   given money for research unrelated to smoking and

8   health?

9       A    Yes.  All the funding from special projects,

10   all the grants that were given out by CTR came to

11   Roswell Park, were digitized by me.  So yes, I've seen

12   many scientists and ones who were in the White Papers

13   quoted by the industry denying the risk, 95 percent of

14   them were on the payroll of the industry.

15       Q    And it's mentioned Shook Hardy.  What is Shook

16   Hardy?  Is that a law firm?

17       A    That was the law firm that oversaw the Council

18   For Tobacco Research and were hired by the defendants.

19       Q    Okay.  So let's look publicly in this time

2 0       frame.  We've looked at the '50s and the '60s and the

21   early '7 0s.

22             Okay.  I'm sorry.  I wasn't finished with this 2 3       document.

24             In my over-cautious view, the Jensen issue

25   raises a larger question:  Whether CTR special projects

1   funds and after such activities were moved out of CTR,

2    joint industry funds administered through Shook Hardy

3   were used to purchase favorable judicial or legislative

4   testimony, thereby perpetrating a fraud on the public.

5   Admittedly, this notion of fraud was unknown to the

6   common law, but if we assume the other side of the

7   looking glass, perhaps it is cause for concern.

8             Is this consistent with that earlier internal

9   document where at least someone is expressing a concern

10   that they may be perpetrating a fraud?

11       A    Yes.

12       Q    All right.  So I'm going to say let's � did

13   this public � these public statements about cigarette

14   smoking and health continue by the tobacco company in

15   the 1970s on a massive scale, as far as putting out this

16   message that it wasn't proven and there was still an

17   unknown etiology for lung disease?

18       A    Yes.  The budget of the Tobacco Institute went

19   up tenfold over the Council For Tobacco Research.  So

20   most of the money was put into this public relations

21   effort that really ramped up after the Surgeon General's

22   report first came out.

23       Q    All right.  Let's look at some examples, if we

24   could.

3   firm's strategy.  They win while, quote, losing.

4   Defending the weed.

5             If our product is harmful, says James Bowling,

6   vice president of Philip Morris, we'll stop making it.

7   We now know enough that we can take anything out of

8   product, but we don't know what ingredients to take out.

9             In 1920 it was accepted as a scientific fact

10   that smoking caused TB.  It was later found out that

11   they had no connection after some states even outlawed

12   smoking.

13            We don't know if smoking is harmful to health,

14   and we think somebody ought to find out.

15            Alternative causes of lung cancer.

16            What are some of the other alternative causes

17   the tobacco industry pointed to as to what was causing

18   this rise in lung cancer instead of � instead of

19   smoking?

20       A    What month you were born, certainly air

21   pollution, occupational causes.  But they had some

22   pretty weird ones they came up with.  Exposure to pet

23   waste was one of the things that they mentioned.  I

24   think bird waste, actually.  Completely untrue but it

25   was mentioned.

whereas people who live in rural communities have a

much lower incidence of lung cancer.

There are substances in the air in every city in the United States � and I suspect in every city in the world � which are known to produce cancer.

This becomes especially interesting when we recall, as Dr. William Ober has pointed out, that the vast majority of cigarette smokers don't get lung cancer, while animals who obviously don't smoke at all, do.

Dr. Herbert L. Ratcliff has noted a significant increase in the frequency of lung cancer in water fowl, especially in two species of ducks at the Philadelphia Zoo located in a typical city air pollution area.

Many persons attribute the purported rise of lung cancer to cigarette smoking.  Others, Dr. Langston, for example, question this assumption.

Cancer (indiscernible) is also related to smoking.  Yet, its incidence has remained rather constant.  It has not increased.  And, yet, everyone is talking about their marked rise in the instance of lung cancer.  If they are both caused by the same agent, why is it that one is assumed, quote,

2        remained quite stable?  This doesn't � it is not

3       consistent with either being caused by smoking.

4             I cannot point to anything that I would

5       consider the cause of cancer of the lung, but the

6       behavior of the disease does not support the idea of

7        cigarettes being the causal agent in the production

8       of this disease.

16             I think we have a great deal to learn, and I

17       think far too many people have rushed to a premature

18        judgment based upon very inadequate evidence,

19       chiefly because of the tremendous emotional need to

20       oversimplify and to make things easy and palatable

2   Dr. Langston, Dr. Levine � all disputing that cigarette

3   smoking caused lung disease, correct?

4       A    Correct.

5       Q    Is this what you were talking about earlier as

6   far as the appearance of independent scientists giving

7   this information being more powerful than even if the

8   tobacco industry themselves were saying it?

9       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

10       Q    Is this a consistent theme of what CTR did

11   behind the scenes when it was acting as a front and a

12   shield?

13       A    Yes.  Primarily through their special projects

14   program.

15       Q    There are other videos like this too?  Similar

16   ones where they're giving information?

17       A    Yes, and the videos were widely distributed and |

18   shown in schools, you know, the Kiwanis, the Elks Club,

19   the animal clubs as I call them.  So � and they kept

20   track of the millions of Americans that got exposed to

21   their message, and this was a consistent message that

22   they put out through a variety of means.  The films are 2 3        just one example.

5            MR. PRYSOCK:  All right.  Let's look at a

6       couple.  PT1277.

7            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I object, and I would

8       ask to be heard about this, what they're doing.

9             THE COURT:  Come to sidebar.

10             (Sidebar was held outside the hearing of the

11   jury:)

12            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, my recollection is

13       that, in the context of letters like these,

14       Your Honor ruled that they were supposed to redact

15       the fact that it was sent to a school because what

16       they wanted from these documents were the positions

17       that were being sent out to individuals in the

18       public.  But the references to it going to a school,

19       I recall Your Honor ordering that that had to be

20       redacted.

21             THE COURT:  I don't � I don't remember.  But

22        I'll tell you, why don't you just go to something

23       else.  Come back to this one, and over at lunch you

24        can figure out if I did that.

1       ruling was.  And the ruling was it was a 1993 one

2       that you said let's go ahead and redact that out

3       because it was much later in time.  These you

4       allowed in.  These were not � these were not ruled

5       on as objectionable.

6             THE COURT:  Okay.  When was the ruling?

7            MR. PRYSOCK:  It was � I mean, I can �

8             THE COURT:  There were dozens and dozens of

9       rulings so far.  And I understand that y'all keep

10       track of them and you should.

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  Right.  And I think Mr. Walker

12       has kept track up with them because he's the one who |

13       brought it up, so let's ask him what the ruling was.

14             THE COURT:  Well, no �

15            MR. WALKER:  I'm happy to look for it,

16       Your Honor.  I don't recall Your Honor drawing a

17       distinction between a document like this from 1990

18       versus another year.  These are all after he's

19       reached adulthood, so I think Your Honor's ruling 2 0                would apply to all of them. I don't know why you 21                would have made that ruling for one but not the

2 2                 others.

2 3                           THE COURT:  No.  I definitely �

2 4                           MR. WALKER:  You allowed the document.  I'm

25                sorry.  I'm talking.

1             THE COURT:  All right.  I know that there have

2       been situations where I've allowed things that came

3       afterwards because of the particular situation there

4       and if I look at each one of them separately.  But

15       Q    Sir, what was Project Truth?

16       A    It was a public relations program launched by

17   the Tobacco Institute in the early 1970s.  So, you know,

18   they did some public service ads.  They had what they

19   called the Truth Squad, which was their paid public 2 0       relations people who would go around the country.  I

21       think Anne Browder was part of that, but there were many |

2 2        others.

23             So that was � it was really hatched in the

24   late '60s as a way of counteracting the health effects

25   of smoking.  And they used the TV ads they created to

2            MR. PRYSOCK:  All right.  And if we can look at f

3       one of those.  PT526.

4             (A video clip was played and transcribed by the

5   court reporter to the best of her ability as follows:)

6            Here in Washington, a lot goes on that you

7       never hear about.  Take the controversy about

8       cigarettes.  In the 91st Congress, a house committee

9       heard testimony from leading experts on smoking and

10       health.

11             The record shows that many of the country's

12       most respected doctors openly challenged

13       anticigarette claims.

14            A California doctor said:  As a scientist, I

15       find no persuasive evidence that cigarette smoking

16       causes lung cancer.

17            A New York doctor told Congress:  To claim

18       there is now sufficient scientific evidence to

19       establish that cigarette smoking causes disease is,

20       in my opinion, unjustified.

21             There is another side to the cigarette

22        controversy.  It's all here in this White Paper. 2 3                 Send for it.

1       Q    And at the end of that, that gentleman

2   references a �

3            First of all, what was the date � what was the

4   year of this?

5       A    This came out as a public service ad.  It ran

6   in 1971.  So when cigarette ads were required to go off

7   broadcast, they started running these public service

8   ads.

9       Q    Okay.  And you mentioned the White Paper.  Tell

10   us what White Papers are and how that was used by the

11   tobacco industry?

12       A    Well, the tobacco industry White Papers were

13   like a Q and A type of document written in laymen's

14   language to answer questions.  So they would pose, you

15   know:  Does smoking cause lung cancer?  And then they'd

16   give the industry's response.

17            And they put out these White Papers on an

18   annual basis.  The first one was '54.  That was widely

19   distributed by Hill & Knowlton for the cigarette 2 0        companies.

21            And then they reestablished the White Papers in

22   1968, and they were issued every year between 1968 and

23   1984, I believe.

24            And then the open controversy campaign kicked

25   in from Reynolds.

1       Q    And that's � we have a demonstrative of that,

2   PER003.  This is going back to '54, and then we have

3   them in 1978, 1979, and 1984.

4             Is this what you're talking about, these White

5   Papers?

6       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

7       Q    Were they widely distributed?

8       A    They were.  They � they would send them to,

9   you know, editorial news people.  I would � sometimes

10   when I was asked to go in and talk about a study when I

11   was at Roswell Park up in Buffalo, it would appear on

12   television or the radio.

13             It was very common for the person doing the

14   interview to have these White Papers right there.

15   Sometimes they would actually have a representative from |

16   the Tobacco Institute that would appear on the show as

17   well.                                                                                                                    |

1            And this is in what year?  1979?

2       A    Yeah.  1979 was important because the Surgeon

3   General had put out their 15th anniversary report, a

4   very thick Surgeon General's report that was issued in

5    '79.  And the industry essentially ran a preemptive

13             Is that also � is emphysema a type of chronic

18             The confusion about COPD is reflected in the

19   contradictory pronouncements by various public health

21   pamphlets proclaim that cigarette smoking is the main if |

22   not only cause of COPD, other more candid PHS statements

3       A    Yes.

4       Q    And the reaction of others at R. J. Reynolds?

5       A    Quite upset if they were deviating from the

6   basic position that it was unproven.

7            MR. PRYSOCK:  All right.  Let's look at PT1913.

8   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

9       Q    And have you seen this document before from

10   1982?

11       A    Yes.  This is from Wayne Juchatz to his boss

12   Sam Witt, who was the chief general counsel at

13   R. J. Reynolds.  And they had done an interview with the

14   new vice president for research and development,

15   Dr. DiMarco, and they're commenting about the content of

16   that interview and some things that came up that gave

17   them concern.

18       Q    I explained our legal concerns about the

19   admission � admission, implicit in the words less

20   mutagenic or safer, that our existing products are

21   mutagenic or unsafe.

22            What does mutagenic means?

23       A    Mutagenic means that the exposure to the

24   chemicals caused DNA damage to the cells, which is the

25   first process in the development of cancer.

1       Q    He seemed to understand our concern but refused

2   to accept it as a rationale for not doing what he felt

3   we had an obligation to do as a responsible

4   manufacturer.

5             I stated that one of the elements of our legal

6   defense was that there was no dose-response relationship

7   between cigarette consumption and lung cancer and that

8   what he was saying seemed to contradict this position.

9            He responded that what he was saying was in

10   direct contradiction to this position and that most of

11   the scientists who testified in our behalf on this issue

12   in the past or who had taken this position in the

13   medical literature would no longer support it.

14             He also said, although I can't recall his exact

15   words, that our medical/scientific witnesses will say

16   whatever we want them to say, clearly implying, if not

17   stating, that they lacked credibility and integrity.

18            Now, talking about the medical/scientific

19   witnesses, is that � when we're talking about CTR, we

20   were talking about medical scientific witnesses,

21   correct?

22       A    Correct.

23       Q    One of the documents we talked about earlier �

5   they actually discussed how successful they were in

7            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, may I have a

8       continuing objection to this line of guestioning

9       about lobbying?

21       increasing complexity of life in the tobacco

23             The institute was still developing when the

24        industry was rocked by the Surgeon General's report

25       alleging a link between lung cancer and smoking.

Page 1562 Separating fact from fiction became one of the

institute's most important duties, a function by

which most Americans know the Tobacco Institute as

aggressive advocate of tobacco interests.

That brings us to the here and now.  You may take for granted a great many aspects of the Tobacco Institute if you knew of them at all.  Most organizations would feel disadvantaged with such a low profile.  But this is entirely appropriate to our work since most of what we do takes place outside of the public and the rest of the industry even though our concerns are very much those of the public and the industry.

Most of the Tobacco Institute's work is with people who represent the public's interest. Washington, Capitol Hill, the senior senator from Kentucky is Walter D. Huddleston, a democrat who entered the Senate in 1972.

We work very closely with the Tobacco Institute and have ever since I've been in the United States Senate.  It is without a doubt one of the leading associations as far as being able to inform the members of Congress very accurately and very timely about the implications of various legislative suggestions and also help initiate legislative

1       initiatives that will improve the situation as far

2       as the tobacco industry is concerned.

3            We enjoy working with them.  We have a good

4        relationship with them.  We know that we can trust

5       them.  They do not make any attempt to mislead me or

6       any other member of the Congress, and consequently

7       they have the confidence of the members, and I think |

8       this is very important.

11       Q    Sir, we've talked about the controversy and

12   this continuing controversy of smoking and health.  And

13   who was solely responsible for this issue of whether

14   smoking � whether smoking causes diseases like lung

15   disease and emphysema over the last � or since 1958?

16             THE COURT:  Rephrase that, please.

17            MR. WALKER:  Thank you.

18   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

19       Q    This controversy we keep referring to over

2 0       smoking and health, was it real or was it made up in the

21   last � or since the 1960s forward?

22       A    It was a false controversy.  It was made up, 2 3       and it was made up by the cigarette companies and

24   perpetuated by their affiliated organization, the

25   Tobacco Institute and the Council For Tobacco Research.

1       Q    And when was the Tobacco Institute officially

2   disbanded?  When did these things happen such that the

3   controversy � that mixed message was no longer able to

4   be put out?  What year?

5       A    1998.

6       Q    And in the last 15 or so years since the

7   controversy ended, what has happened to smoking rates in

8   the United States?

9       A    Cigarette prevalence is at its lowest rate I

10   think it's been since the early 1930s.  Cigarette

11   consumption has fallen.  Very few young people are

12   taking up smoking today compared to what it was 20 years

13   ago.

14       Q    And we've looked at that consumption chart �

15            MR. PRYSOCK:  If we can pull that up, the

16       consumption chart.

18       Q    Have you studied epidemiology for most of your

19   career, Dr. Cummings?

20       A    I taught epidemiology graduate students for 25

21   years.

22       Q    And epidemiology is what?

23       A    To study disease patterns in human populations

24   to try to understand what causes those diseases and to

25   try to mitigate them.

1       Q    The � on the right side of this graph, the

2   downward trend finally in lung cancer since about 2000,

3   is that reflective of the decreased rates of smoking?

4       A    Yes.  This is in men.  So smoking prevalence

5   went up first in men because they took it up in large

6   numbers right around World War I and thereafter, and

7   women were a little bit delayed.  And smoking

8   prevalences dropped dramatically among men in this

9   country and is continuing to fall.  And we see a similar f

10   decline in diseases like lung cancer, and hopefully

11   we'll see COPD � although COPD is a disease that people

12   live with for a long time.  And so �

13       Q    This red line is the number of deaths caused in |

14   the United States by cigarette smoking just � just �

15   well, what is it exactly?

16       A    Yes.  It's � you know, it's deaths � of male

17   lung cancer deaths.

18       Q    Okay.                                                                                                |

19       A    So this is expressed per 100,000 in the

2 0       population.  You can see it doesn't even get counted

21   before 1930 because it was pretty rare but rapidly

22   increased during the 20th century.  In men it peaked in

23   the early '90s and then has begun to fall and continues

24   to fall as cigarette consumptions declines.

2 5       Q    And how many Americans have died as a result of |

9   happened in 1954?  The formation of what?

10       A    That was the formation of the conspiracy of the

12   TIRC and later TI and perpetuated that organization over |

13   the next 45 years.

14       Q    Based upon your experience in epidemiology, if

15   1954 � if the smoking rates had declined to what they

16   are now instead of continuing to go up over the entire

17   length of the controversy, how many millions of people

18   would not have lost their lives?

6            Have y'all figured out what it was that you

7       were going to find, some sort of transcript?  You

8        forgot?

9            MR. PRYSOCK:  No.  But I'm going on now so it

10       doesn't matter.  We're running out of time.

14            Ms. Freeman, are all the jurors here?

16       will check again.

17            MR. PRYSOCK:  Your Honor, we do have an issue

18       we wanted to bring up with the Camel Crush, the

19       question about Camel Crush that I was asking earlier |

20       and defense objected.  If we could just be heard on

21       that briefly.

22             THE COURT:  You can be heard.  I will hear you. | 2 3                           MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.  Well, Ms. Humphries is

2 4                going to make the legal argument, but so we're clear f

Page 1573 good job of explaining it, but Camel Crush is a

cigarette.  It's not something different like Snus,

or something like that.  It is a cigarette product.

I mean, it's a cigarette.  It's the same type of

thing � in that Claude Teague memo, an R.J.

Reynolds document from 1973 that we showed the jury

talked about a new novel filter for a cigarette to

entice youth to smoke.  And that Camel Crush, which

they have come out with now, is that type of

cigarette.  It's actually got a bead in it, a

menthol bead, that you push the filter and it

releases the menthol, which we've also talked about

menthol.

So the reason we want to put it in, Your Honor, is it's just a continuing course of conduct of marketing to kids, which clearly Mr. Price started smoking back then.  It is the same type of conduct and it goes to the reprehensibility, and it's continuing today.  And it also specifically � go ahead.

I'm sorry.  I'm getting into her legal argument.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Your Honor, it's an argument that's been made many times, and also the First District has affirmed.  In our decision in Townsend,

Page 1574 which the First District reviewed, they addressed

this very argument.

THE COURT:  Having to do with Camel Crush?

MS. HUMPHRIES:  No, Your Honor, it had to do with the same category of evidence.  The evidence is youth marketing, marketing to the youth of America.

And one of the reasons why �

THE COURT:  You've put on a half a day of youth marketing.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Right.  This is one example of it.

THE COURT:  The Townsend thing talks about things that occurred recently.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Yes.  That's why he asked me to address this point.  So I actually have with me RJR's brief.  This is exactly what they argued, that when you're getting to late in time in the 90's, and all, that the jury shouldn't be hearing about that. And in fact, what the Florida � what the First District held, and the Florida Supreme Court denied review of that decision, is that evidence is actually relevant for punitive damages because it shows that the defendant continued doing the same sorts of things for decades and decades.

So when you're talking about this kind of stuff

Page 1575 in the 90's � and I can quote to you from the

decision.

THE COURT:  From Townsend.  I would like that.

MR. WALKER:  I don't know if you want me to wait, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'm putting the cart before the horse.  It's your objection.  Go ahead.

MR. WALKER:  Well, I wasn't sure if she had finished.

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. WALKER:  Addressing Townsend.  Townsend would not have addressed the issue that Your Honor is facing, which at this moment it isn't whether it might be admissible at some point in the case.

The objection that I made was that if it's admissible it would be admissible in the second phase of trial.  That's when the evidence is put in.

Ms. Humphries made some references to what was going on in the 90's.  That's not nothing to do with Camel Crush.  Camel Crush did not exist in the 1990's.  It wasn't on the market until 2008.  So it's a Phase 2 issue, and Townsend is not going to tell you otherwise, because that wasn't even an issue on appeal that I'm aware of, and it certainly wasn't an issue addressed by the opinion.

Page 1576 THE COURT:  Ms. Humphries, did Townsend � was

that evidence allowed in?

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  In Phase 1 or Phase 2?

MS. HUMPHRIES:  In Phase 1.  And this is the same argument � I have their briefs with me.  It's the same argument they made to the First District.

THE COURT:  Well, read to me where it came in in Phase 1.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  One second, Your Honor, if you don't mind.

Your Honor, I was just reminded, and it's an important point, when you read the language in Townsend I'm going to read to you, what really happened was the jury was told to consider this for the Phase 1 question.

When we talk about that we mean �

THE COURT:  I understand.  Go ahead.

MS. HUMPHRIES: The same exact scenario, I want to let you know, happened in Allen, also went to the First District.

THE COURT:  Allen hasn't been affirmed.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  Yes.

THE COURT:  It has?  When did Allen get affirmed?

extent that Allen 1, if you remember, only �

THE COURT:  Oh, do I remember.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  And at the very outset of the opinion it says that we reject there the same arguments.

THE COURT:  Oh, I understand.  They rejected everything, including the remittitur part.  They didn't even write on that, or they decided they weren't going to write on it.

I'm not going to be influenced by Allen.

MS. HUMPHRIES:  All right.  The point is, one thing that counsel might say to you is that an unusual fact in Townsend is that the two questions were tried together, so there was no separate phase that the jury came back for determining the amount.

That does not impact what the holding says. What the holding says is when the jury considered reprehensibility, the Phase 1 question, the jury was given an express instruction that it can consider all of the evidence, specifically including evidence of youth marketing going long after.

And what the court said is � here is one part of it.  It addresses it quite a bit � R.J. Reynolds also contends that the punitive damage award was

1       based on improper considerations, including a lot of |

2       things, youth marketing, not seen or relied upon by

3       Mr. Townsend and argument of counsel.

4             The court goes on � the First District goes

5       on � and here is our point to you � harm to non-

6       parties caused by the conduct that harmed the

7       plaintiff is admissible and relevant to show the

8       extent of reprehensibility of the defendant's

9       conduct.

10             They go on to say �

11             THE COURT:  You say in Townsend they didn't

12       have Phase 1 and Phase 2?

13            MS. HUMPHRIES:  They had it bundled, and they

14       had an instruction to the jury saying when you

15       consider all of this evidence it's only on the

16       Phase 1 question, was the conduct reprehensible

17       enough to warrant punitives.

18             THE COURT:  Okay.  I'm going to sustain the

19       objection without prejudice to do it if we go to 2 0                 Phase 2.

21                           MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

2 4                 problems �

1            Are you familiar with the Fairness Doctrine?

2       A    Yes.

3       Q    And if can you briefly describe what it was and

4   what the timeframe was of the Fairness Doctrine.

5       A    Sure.  The Fairness Doctrine was a part of our

6   law when basically the public airways, television,

7   radio, and so on, it requires equal time for opposing

8   points of view to be on the air.  So as it relates to

9   cigarette use in the late 1960's, actually mid 1960's,

10   the Federal Communications Commission, which oversaw the

11   Fairness Doctrine, was petitioned to provide equal time

12   on television and radio for public health messages about

13   smoking to counteract all of the cigarette ads that were

14   on television at the time.

15       Q    And public health was given that opportunity;

16   correct?

17       A    That was debated, and the FCC ruled that there

18   was a legitimate basis for enforcing the Fairness

19   Doctrine for this particular issue, and, yes, the

20   broadcast radio and television stations were required to

21   give equal time, although as it turned out, when you go

22   back and look at it there were about four cigarette ads

23   for every one antismoking ad.  But it was really the

24   first time the public got exposed in any large way to

25   the health messages about smoking and health.

1       Q    Okay.  Even though it was still 4 to 1 ratio,

2    just that one � the one that they were able to get out,

3   there was some powerful PSA's that went out at the time;

4   correct?

5       A    Yes.  Each of the health voluntary

6   organizations, lung, heart, and cancer, were asked to

7   provide ads, and they did, and some of the ads were very

8   powerful.

9            William Tallman, who had been Perry Mason's

10   sidekick, the district attorney who always lost to him

11   in those cases, was diagnosed with lung cancer, and he

12   did an ad for the American Cancer Society called Don't

13   Be a Loser, because he didn't want to lose his family.

14             Of course he lost all those cases, but then he

15   talks about not wanting to lose the battle to lung

16   cancer because of his smoking.

17       Q    If we can, let's look at that PSA.  And these

18   PSA's were a good thing; right?  I mean, this was �

19   could have a demonstrative affect on people and smoking

20   rates?

21       A    It was a very good thing.

3       after all of us.  And that's me, Bill Tallman, with

4       a friend of mine you might recognize.  You know, I

5       didn't really mind losing all those courtroom

6       battles, but I'm in a battle right now I don't want

7       to lose at all, because if I lose it means losing my

8       wife and those kids you just met.  I have lung

9       cancer.  Take some advice about smoking and losing

10        from someone who has been doing both for years.  If

11       you don't smoke, don't start.  If you do smoke,

12       quit.  Don't be a loser.

13             (Video concluded.)

14       Q    Dr. Cummings, that theme that it's not just the

15   smokers, but the smoker's family that's affected, that

16   had a powerful affect on people and it resonated; right?

17       A    Yes.  The Heart Association did a PSA, Like

18   Father Like Son, which showed a father walking with his

19   young child, sitting down under a tree, and the child

20   throwing the stones and doing � imitating his father,

21   and then the father sits down under the tree and pulls

22   out the pack of cigarettes and places them down, and the

23   child puts his hand on the pack of cigarettes, again

24   communicating the message like father like son.

25             You know, they were a little corny, but they

1   were actually very powerful about getting the message

2   across about, you know, what smoking does and how

3   harmful it is.

4       Q    And if we look at � we will pull it up in a

5   moment, we don't have to pull it up yet, but consumption

6   of cigarettes at the time, during that '68 to '70

7   timeframe when the Fairness Doctrine was in effect

8   cigarette sales actually dropped for a little bit?

9       A    Yes, during the Fairness Doctrine period, which

10   really ran from '67, because they argued about it in

11    '66, but they finally got the broadcast stations to give

12   them time to air these commercials in '67, '68, '69, and

13   then cigarette ads went off of television in '71, and

14   then the Fairness Doctrine ads went off the air.

15             Cigarette sales were actually going down as

16   people really for the first time were getting exposed

17   every night when they were watching TV, not just to

18   cigarette ads, but now to the counter message about the

19   dangers of smoking.

20       Q    Even those a lot of these PSA's ran really late

21   at night, or whenever, they still had a demonstrable

22   affect; correct?

23       A    That's correct.

1            MR. PRYSOCK:  That's all right.

2       Q    Did the tobacco industry make public comments

3   about these PSA's?

4       A    Yes.

5       Q    If we can look at one, PT5458.

6            Anti Cigarette TV Ads Called False/Misleading

7   By Tobacco Official.  The antismoking commercials of

8   radio and television include false and misleading

9   statements, an official of the tobacco industry charged

10   here today.  The tobacco people have remained silent a

11   little too long, John Landry said in an interview before

12   his speech at noon before the Cleveland Advertising

13   Club.  He is vice president and group director of

14   marketing for tobacco products of Philip Morris, Inc.

15            And, Dr. Cummings, I think you at least alluded

16   to it, but as this was having a demonstrable affect on

17   people and smoking rates in the country what happened to

18   the Fairness Doctrine?

19       A    Well, it went away basically as it applied to

20   cigarettes when cigarette advertising went off of

21   broadcast TV and radio.  That happened in '71.

22       Q    And did � so did cigarette companies, did they

23   voluntarily go off the air then?

24       A    No.  Congress mandated them to go off the air.

25   They passed the Cigarette Labeling Act in '69 and

1   updated the warnings that went on the packs, required

2   warnings to go on print ads starting in '72, and banned

3   broadcast cigarette advertising.

4       Q    And have you seen documents where they

5   retrospectively � R.J. Reynolds retrospectively

6   discusses the Fairness Doctrine and how they shifted

7   things after that?

8       A    Yes.  They shifted their advertising

9   expenditures into other forms of advertising:  NASCAR

10   racing, product placements in movies, massive amounts of

11   billboard.  There were specialty magazines coming out

12   for different target audiences, you know, women, men,

13   African Americans, and so on.  So you saw many of those

14   publications being loaded up with cigarette ads.

15       Q    If we can look at PT5848, 1982.  And this is

16   Diane Burrows � or is this Diane Burrows again?

17       A    Yes.

18       Q    If we can look:  The Fairness Doctrine was also

19   found to have an important negative effect during its

20   first year, accounting for a 3 percentage point drop in

21   12 to 17 incidence.

22             12 to 17 incidence.  What does that mean?

23       A    Well, the number of new smokers taking up

24   smoking.  Young people.

25       Q    Is that ages?

1       A    Yeah, we're looking at the rate.  The incidence

2   rate of new smokers year to year among this 12 to

3   17-year-old group actually dropped during this period of

4   time.

5       Q    But showed diminishing returns during its

6   second and third year.  Cigarette advertising on TV was

7   found to particularly offset the doctrine effect.

8            And while the Fairness Doctrine and this PSA

9   were running was cigarette advertising still running on

10   TV at the time?

11            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I'm sorry to

12        interrupt.  He misread the document.  The word is

13       actually partially.

14            MR. PRYSOCK:  It's right there for everybody,

15       but if I did, I apologize.

16       Q    Cigarette advertising on TV was found to

17   partially offset the doctrine's effects.

18            Was that true, that ads were still running?

19       A    Yes.

20       Q    Thus the absence of TV advertising after 1970

21   was implicitly a negative effect, but the absence of the

22   fairness was a larger implicit positive.

23            Positive being what?

24       A    Positive �

1             THE COURT:  Sustained.

2       Q    Was the absence � as a public health official,

3   Dr. Cummings, was the absence of the Fairness Doctrine a

4   positive?

5       A    No, it was not a positive.  Cigarette sales

6   rebounded after the Fairness Doctrine ads went off the

7   air and the companies doubled down on their other

8   marketing, where they spent their marketing dollars.

9       Q    And what are we looking at here?  It's part of

10   that Burrows document.  Demonstrative.  I'm sorry.  This

11   is demonstrative PT2606.

12       A    Correct.  This is FTC data, and it's looking at

13   expenditures for cigarette advertising on radio,

14   newspaper, magazines, direct point of sale, billboards,

15   and other, and just showing you millions of dollars

16   spent during that time period.

17             So you can see when the Fairness Doctrine comes

18   in in '71 there's a drop from what it had been in 1970,

19   but it then begins to rebound.  And actually if you

20   follow this out it actually continues to go up year

21   after year.  By 1980 it was a billion a year.

22       Q    Along with that PSA public health officials

23   were still trying to get out the message to counteract

24   the controversy; correct?

25       A    Sure.

1       Q    In fact, who is Dr. Horn?

2       A    Daniel Horn.  He was the director of the

3   National Clearinghouse on Smoking and Health, which was

4   the organization set up actually by congress in 1965 to

5   put out the Surgeon General's reports on smoking and

6   health, and they also did public education around

7   smoking and health.

8       Q    Did Dr. Horn have a public statement about

9   telling people about the dangers of smoking, at least

10   what public health was trying to do, shouting it from

11   rooftops?

12       A    Yes.  I think he made the statement they were

13   doing everything possible to tell people about the

14   dangers of smoking, and he also said it was very

15   difficult, because addicted smokers tend to be resistant

16   to that message.

17       Q    And did he know internally what the tobacco

18   companies were doing as far as CTR, TI, TIRC, and those

19   documents, were they available to him at the time?

20            MR. WALKER:  Objection.  Calls for speculation. |

21             THE COURT:  Sustained.

22       Q    Were those documents where they discussed what

23   they were doing internally and what their plan was, were

24   those available to people like Dr. Horn at the time?

25       A    No.                                                                                                     |

1       Q    I would like to � I would like to talk to you

2   briefly about cigarette design.

3             Have you studied the design of cigarettes as

4   part of your research at Roswell Park Cancer Institute?

5       A    At Roswell and now at the Medical University,

6   yes.  I've done many studies on cigarette design and how |

7   it influences how people smoke, the exposures they get,

8   and their disease risk.

9       Q    Have you also seen the internal documents of

10   the company where they discuss design changes they're

11   making, and their intent in making those design changes?

12       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

13       Q    Are there features of � design features of the

14   cigarette that affect how nicotine is inhaled and

15   ingested in the body?

16       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

17       Q    And just so we're clear, is nicotine a random

18   thing that occurs in cigarettes as far as the levels of

19   nicotine and the amounts?

2 0       A    No, it's not.  It doesn't happen by accident.

21   It's precisely controlled by the manufacturer.

22       Q    If we could look at PT1552, please.  Is this

23   Brown & Williamson?

24       A    Correct.  This is Dr. Griffis, who was the head f

25   of research and development at Brown & Williamson,

Veritext Reporting Company 212-2 7 9-9424                        www.veritext.com                        212-490-3 430

1   writing to his boss over in England, the British

2   American Tobacco Company, talking about their ability to

3   control nicotine and sugar levels in cigarettes that

4   they sell.  This is 1963.

5       Q    Okay.  And nicotine is by far the most

6   characteristic single constituent in tobacco, and the

7   known physiological effects are positively correlated to

8   smoker response.  Certainly our own sales pattern during

9   this period has been positively correlated with the

10   nicotine level of the tobacco in our products.

11   Certainly the nicotine level of B&W cigarettes, given

12   the above table, was not obtained by accident.  It may

13   be well to remind you, however, that we have a research

14   program in progress to obtain, by genetic means, any

15   level of nicotine desired.  I think that we can say even

16   now that we can regulate fairly and precisely the

17   nicotine and sugar levels to almost any desired level

18   management might require.  Of this I am confident.

19             Is this consistent with other documents you've

20   seen from not just Brown & Williamson, but R.J. Reynolds

21   and the other, where they can precisely maintain

22   whatever level of nicotine they want in their

23   cigarettes?

24       A    Yes.

25       Q    Is there anything requiring them to put

1   nicotine, or put high levels of nicotine in their

2   cigarettes?  Are they required to do that?

3       A    No, they can take the nicotine out.  There are

4   patents that go back to the 20's about extracting

5   nicotine from their product.

6            You can breed tobacco to be high, medium, or

7   low levels of nicotine.  So there's nothing that's

8   preventing them from reducing dramatically the nicotine

9   levels in their products so it would be nonaddictive.

10       Q    Previously we looked at � well, I don't know

11   if we have looked at some of the additives.  Let me

12   start again.

13            Are there internal documents where they discuss

14   adding different chemicals to their cigarettes and

15   studying the effect on animals?

16            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I'm sorry to

17        interrupt, but under the rule of completeness there

18       was a passage that wasn't read from the last

19       document, and I would ask that it be read at this

20       time.  It's on the very first page.

21            MR. PRYSOCK:  Sure.  Absolutely.

22            MR. WALKER:  Go to the first page, the sentence

23       beginning, I should emphasize, midway in the first

24       paragraph, second to last sentence:  I should

4             Thank you Your Honor.

5       Q    Then it goes on:  At any rate, you have my

6   permission to use any of the information herein

7   contained.

8             Dr. Cummings, this document that discusses

9   precise levels of nicotine, and they go through and

10   analyze different levels in different cigarettes, is

11   that only � is that only theory and just one person's

12   opinion, or is it consistent throughout their documents?

13       A    No, it's consistent throughout their documents.

14       Q    Okay.  I was asking you about additives, and if |

15   we can look at PT3389.  1989.

16            Enhancement of nicotine binding to nicotinic

17   receptors by nicotine levulinate and levulinic acid.

18            Whose company is this; which document?

19       A    R.J. Reynolds.

20       Q    Okay.  And this is 1989.  The group is � who

21   is the group that's doing this research?

22       A    This is their biochemical and biobehavioral R&D

1   particular additive in animal behavior.

2       Q    Okay.  And it talks about nicotinic receptors.

3            What are nicotinic receptors?

4       A    These are the receptors in the brain where

5   nicotine will bind in the brain and cause the release of

6   certain neurohormones like dopamine, and other hormones

7   that give you the effect.  Dopamine is a stimulant.

8   It' s sort of known as the reward chemical in drug

9   addiction.

10            And so they're looking at ways to potentiate

11   the effect of these hormones in the brain by use of

12   additives, in this case levulinic acid, and seeing

13   whether they would bind more, have a greater affinity to

14   bind to these receptors in the brain.

15            And so these were studies that Reynolds had

16   done with animals.  They did them in-house as well as

17   they had contract labs outside of Reynolds that did some

18   of this work, and they would expose the animals to a

19   certain amount of nicotine, constant level of nicotine,

20   then add in the levulinic acid to see what the effect

21   would be on the binding in the brain.

22             So they would sacrifice the animal, chop off

23   the head, dissect the brain, then look at the binding in

24   the brain.  So very sophisticated animal studies on

25   nicotine effects in the brain.

1       Q    Do certain additives affect how the tobacco is

2   inhaled in the lungs?

3       A    Yes.  There are over 600 additives that are

4   used in cigarettes, manufacture of cigarettes.  Not in

5   every brand, but in total about 600 different additives,

6   and they have different effects, some of which

7   facilitate inhalation of smoke.  Propylene glycol,

8   glycerin being one.  Ammonia actually affects

9   inhalation.  So diammonium phosphate is another one that

10   affects inhalation.

11       Q    What is diammonium phosphate?

12       A    It's an ammonia-based compound that � I think

13   we saw in the manufacturing video DAP, diammonium

14   phosphate � that changes the pH of the smoke, and the

15   pH of the smoke can affect the character, the harshness,

16   as well as the binding, you know, the form of nicotine

17   that you get.

18             So it creates more free nicotine, or unbound

19   nicotine, so you get more rapid absorption of nicotine

20   in the bloodstream.

21       Q    And some of these additives, things like brown

22   sugar, honey, things like that, what is the effect of

23   those when they are added, as far as affecting harshness

24   and ability to inhale?

25       A    Well, they in part � some of them in part

1   taste � obviously the sweetness tends to be preferred,

2   but they also can affect the inhaleability of the smoke

3   as well.  So it has some harshness-reducing effects,

4   making it easier to inhale the tobacco, you know, the

5   burn particulates that you get.

6             If you just take untreated tobacco and light it

7   up it will choke you.  So it's heavily treated in

8   sugars, or whatever things that are added, as well as

9   some of these other things that affect the inhaleability

10   of the smoke.

11       Q    What happens to sugar when it's combusted or

12   lit up?

13       A    Well, you do get some byproducts.  Obviously if

14   you've ever burned sugar you sort of get that carmelized

15   burnt smell.  But it can generate carcinogens actually.

16       Q    You mentioned diammonium phosphate.

17            Are there internal documents from these

18   companies where they specifically discuss adding ammonia

19   to cigarettes and the effect, according to them, that it

20   has on the pH of the cigarette?

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    Okay.  If we can look at a couple of those.

23   PT1635.

24            Are you familiar with this document from 1991?

25       A    Yes, this is a Brown & Williamson document, and

1   it's talking about some of the additives that are common

2   in not only their brands, but their competitor's brands.

3       Q    All right.  If we can look at a couple pages.

4            What ammonia does.  Cigarette smoke ammonia is

5   entirely different.  It effectively scavenges those

6   smoke compounds that lead to harshness.  It can liberate

7   free nicotine from the blend, which is associated with

8   increases in impact and satisfaction reported by

9   smokers.  PM uses RT in most but not all domestic

10   brands, both menthol and non-menthol.  R.J. Reynolds

11   uses RT in some brands, most notably Winstons.  They

12   appear to directly ammoniate their paper recon sheet

13   using gaseous ammonia.

14             Going back to that last part, they appear to

15   ammoniate the recon sheet.  We talked about that Friday,

16   I think, but that is reconstituted tobacco that comes

17   out in a sheet where they spray the things on it?

18       A    They actually � you know, it's made out of the

19   scraps.  They take the nicotine out, they take the color

20   out, they make it into a paper sheet, and they reapply

21   nicotine, and they can also apply other chemicals,

22   ammonia being one of the common ones that's added to the

23   tobacco to effect the delivery of nicotine and also

24   effect the inhaleability of the smoke.

2 5       Q    Okay.  And ammonia as an ameliorant.  What

1   ammonia does is that it reacts with some of the known

2   irritants in smoke and converts them into new compounds

3   which are not irritants.  Ammonia, when added to the

4   tobacco blend reacts with the indigenous nicotine salts

5   and liberates free nicotine.  As a result of such change

6   the ratio of extractable nicotine can bound nicotine and

7   the smoke may be altered in favor of extractable

8   nicotine.  As we know, extractable nicotine contributes

9   to impact in cigarette smoke, and this is how ammonia

10   can act as an impact booster.

11             Okay.  Impact booster.  Now, what are we

12   talking about as far as free nicotine versus bound

13   nicotine as it relates to those nicotinic receptors and

14   addiction?

15       A    Well, bound nicotine is less rapidly absorbed

16   in the bloodstream, so it's a drug that's less � it has

17   a slower speed of delivery.  It's not going to be as

18   reenforcing.

19             So if you can speed up the absorption of the

20   nicotine so it hits the brain rapidly, like within

21   seconds, which is what happens with cigarette smoke, it

22   makes it highly addictive.

23            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  There was

24       a pretrial ruling that was addressed in part of my

25       motion on Friday.

Page 1598 THE COURT:  Tell you what I want to do.  I want

to have a sidebar anyway because I want everybody to

stand up and let the blood circulate after lunch.

(Sidebar outside of the hearing of the jury.)

THE COURT:  What.

MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, now for the third or fourth time � I made my objections last week � the witness has just identified a specific design feature and testified that that design feature makes cigarettes highly addictive.  I believe that that is a violation of Your Honor's order that was entered, and essentially tracking the order that was entered in Lee County, that prohibits Dr. Cummings from testifying that any specific design increased the addictive or harmful nature of cigarettes.

This is the third time he's done it.

THE COURT:  What do you want to say?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Your Honor, I was asking him the question in the context of their own words in this document, and the next couple documents we are about to show, their own words as to what the intent was. And that's what I started this with intent, and I highlighted intent, what was their intent.  And that's what he's talking about, and this document and the next couple show exactly what we're talking

Page 1599 about, that they did it because they believed it

would make them more addictive, there would be more

free nicotine to bind to the nicotine receptors.

We're not running anywhere close to that ruling.  That's why I'm specifically couching these questions like that.

The ruling in Lee County was that he can discuss in a historical context what they were doing an intending to do.  He can't say now that I believe this one particular design �

THE COURT:  Let me see.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Sure.  And I will be happy to clarify it because we have got a couple more of these documents.

THE COURT:  I'm finally getting to where I'm supposed to read.  I'm trying to see what the problem is.  I apologize, but �

MR. WALKER:  I can't tell if you've reached the question.

THE COURT:  I'm before you objected.  It says if you speed up the absorption in nicotine so it hits the brain, which is what happens with cigarette smoke, it makes it highly addictive.

MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.  That is very different from what Mr. Prysock just represented

Page 1600 what the witness said.  He didn't say the companies

believed that.  He stated it as a fact, as an

opinion that he holds in this case that that design

feature makes cigarettes more addictive, makes them

highly addictive.

And that's � this dance we're doing where there's an assertion that it's about what they intended, and he never � and he's not saying that, he's saying it as a fact that made it highly addictive.

The request I made on Friday at a minimum was for a limiting instruction so the jury can be expressly told that they may not consider that testimony for the purpose of concluding that these design features made cigarettes more addictive or more harmful.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Do you want to be heard?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, Your Honor, just briefly.  I started this with have you �

THE COURT:  I understand your question.  It's what he said that he's objecting to.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, he's taking one little phrase that was used in the answer.  I will clarify this.  It's in these documents.  It's not his opinion specifically, it's in these documents.

THE COURT:  Does it say that?

MR. PRYSOCK:  I don't know if it says exactly highly addictive.  It says it makes it more � that one document we just looked at is talking about more of an impact, more of an impact booster because it's bound to the nicotine receptors usually.  I will clarify.

testimony about designs used in some cigarettes.

Prior to the � prior to trial the court determined

that Dr. Cummings was not qualified to offer expert

opinions on whether any cigarette design led to an

increase in addiction, and ruled that Dr. Cummings

should not attempt to offer any such testimony

during this trial.  Accordingly, the testimony you

just heard was not offered to suggest that any

specific design feature of cigarettes other than

nicotine itself caused an increase in addiction or

health risk associated with cigarettes, or led to an

increase in the addiction or health problems of any

one plaintiff.  You may not consider such testimony

for that purpose � for those purposes.

And, you know, going into what my pretrial rulings were and what the qualifications are, and all that sort of thing, I'm just � but I am going to give some of this.  Just give me a few minutes and I'm going to instruct the jury.  Thank you.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Your Honor, one more thing, because I was at this hearing.  I know this hearing � I mean, it was over days of testimony.

The ruling is not that he can't say because of design changes cigarettes are more addictive now.

1       Q    Okay.  The ratio of extractable nicotine to

2   bound nicotine in the smoke may be altered in favor of

3   extractable nicotine.  As we know, extractable nicotine

4   contributes to impact in cigarette smoke, and this is

5   how ammonia can act as an impact booster.

6            Extractable nicotine being what, according to

21       Q    Okay.  And this is talking about still within

22   an old-style filter.  Any desire for additional nicotine

23   kick could be easily obtained through pH regulation. 2 4                           What does adding ammonia have to do with pH 25       regulation, according to their own documents?

1       A    It changes the smoke from slightly acidic to

2   more basic, creating more free nicotine.

3       Q    Okay.  So smoke that is more � that changes

4   from acidic, how does that change, according to your own

5   studies, the harshness of the smoke and the ability to

6   get in deep in the lungs?

7       A    Well, you have � if it's too basic it's very

8   harsh.  That's what cigars are.  They're above 8 on the

9   pH scale, which goes from 0 to 14.  If it's too acidic

10   it's not easily inhaled.  So you have to hit the right

11   spot in between.

12             Smoke, without adding chemicals like ammonia,

13   will be slightly acidic, around 5.6, 5.8 on the pH

14   scale, and by adding ammonia or other pH modifiers,

15   because there are others, you can basically change the

16   pH so it's above 6, where more of the nicotine is in its

17   free form.

18       Q    Free form meaning the unbound form that

19   attaches more easily to nicotinic receptors, according

20   to their documents?

1       A    R.J. Reynolds.

2       Q    Implications and activities arising from

3   correlation of smoke pH with nicotine impact, other

4   smoke qualities and cigarette sales.

5            What year is this?

6       A    1973.  Claude Teague is the author.

7       Q    All evidence indicates that the relatively high

8   smoke pH, high alkalinity, shown by Marlboro and other

9   Philip Morris brands, and Kool, is deliberate and

10   controlled.  This has raised questions as to the affect

11   of higher smoke pH on nicotine impact and smoke quality,

12   hence market performance and how the higher smoke pH

13   might be accomplished.  In essence, a cigarette is a

14   system for delivery of nicotine to the smoker in

15   attractive useful form.  At normal smoke pH, at or below

16   about 6.0, essentially all of the smoke nicotine is

17   chemically combined with acidic substances.

18            And then it goes on to talk about:  As the

19   smoke pH increases above about 6.0 an increasing

20   proportion of the total smoke nicotine occurs in free

21   form, which is volatile, rapidly absorbed by the smoker,

22   and believed to be instantly perceived as nicotine kick.

23             Is that what you were talking about when you

24   were talking about changing the pH?

25       A    Yes.

1       Q    Marlboro and Kool � methods which may be used

2   to increase smoke pH and/or nicotine kick include

3   increasing the amount of strong burley in the blend,

4   reduction of casing sugar, use of alkaline additives,

5   usually ammonia compounds to the blend, addition of

6   nicotine to the blend, removal of acids to the blend,

7   special filter systems, high filtration dilution

8   systems.  Methods 1 through 3 in combination represent

9   the Philip Morris approach and are under active

10   investigation.

11            Are these all types of ways to change,

12   according to what they said, the pH in cigarettes

13   affecting the nicotine kick?

14       A    Yes.

15       Q    Last one, PT1834.  Again this company, is this

16   R.J. Reynolds?

17       A    It is.

18       Q    1980.  And this is a formerly secret document?

19       A    Internal business record. 2 0       Q    And Allen Rodgman was �

21       A    He was chief of chemistry at R.J. Reynolds in

22   their research & development unit.

23       Q    If we can look at this.  Okay.  Philip Morris'

24   experience in nicotine technology dates back to pre

25   1968.  We suspect Philip Morris' development of nicotine

1   technology has been closely correlated with its findings

2   from behavioral consumer perception studies.

3   Admittedly, R.J. Reynolds' R&D has been playing catchup

4   in this nicotine technology area.  If the Winston B is

5   any indication, we have caught up to the currently used

6   PM system.  How far pH has progressed in new nicotine

7   technology we are not sure, but the Cambridge and other

8   findings suggest that PM is still much involved in

9   developing new nicotine technology.  We're diligently

10   seeking to determine what PM and Lorillard are doing in

11   this area, plus pursuing some projects in the nicotine

12   area of our own.

13            Dr. Cummings, did in fact R.J. Reynolds start

14   adding ammonia to Winston cigarettes?

15       A    Yes.  That started in 1979 when they added

16   ammonia as an additive to the reconstituted tobacco, the

17   manmade tobacco in Winston.

18       Q    If we can briefly talk about some other design

19   features of cigarettes.

20            What are vent holes in cigarettes, sir?

21       A    In the filter-tipped cigarettes vent holes are

22   the little laser vents that they put inside the filter

23   so when you draw the smoke through the tobacco and

24   through the filter some of the smoke will escape out of

25   the vent hole.  It also allows cooling air to circulate,

1   so it lowers the temperature, reduces the resistance to

2   draw, making it easier for the smoker to take a bigger

3   puff off of the cigarette, and draw it deeper into the

4   airways.

5             So very common to add filter ventilation in

6   cigarettes to lower the tar and nicotine numbers that

7   you get on a standard smoking machine, because it would

8   dilute the amount of tar that would come out into the

9   Cambridge filter that would trap the particulate matter.

10   They weigh that.  That's how they get the tar.

11       Q    Are most consumers aware that the tiny vent

12   holes are there?  Can you see them with the naked eye?

13       A    Most people � the studies that I've done and

14   the studies that I'm familiar with that other people

15   have done, including in the internal business records of

16   the companies, are that people are not aware of the

17   filter vents, unless it's a super ultra light cigarette,

18   which you can really � can't really hide the vents.

19            But most of the ventilation is unknown.  It's

20   easily covered.  And because people take a bigger,

21   deeper puff they actually get much higher particulate

22   levels in their body than they would get on a machine.

23       Q    You said there's that cooling effect on the

24   smoke.  What does that do as far as the ability to get

25   it deeper in the lungs when those vent holes get some

1   air?

2       A    Well, by making the smoke less hot it basically

3   makes it easier to inhale the smoke, so it's not as

4   irritating, although adding oxygen to the smoke actually

5   changes the mutagenicity of the tar.

6       Q    If you rip a cigarette apart and hold the paper

7   up to the light can you see the tiny vent holes at that

8   point?

9       A    Yeah.  In most cigarettes you can't see the

10   filter vents.  A way to do it is you dissect the

11   cigarette, you take the filter, the tipping paper off,

12   and if you hold them up to a light or put a flashlight

13   underneath it or put it under a microscope with a light

14   underneath it the vent holes magically appear.

15             In most regular cigarettes today, full-flavored

16   cigarettes, you get about a single row of vent holes,

17   usually on the order of about 10 to 20 percent

18   ventilation.  For the light cigarettes, or what they �

19   now I guess they use color coding, like golds and so on,

20   those usually have maybe two rows of filter vents, and

21   the ventilation holes are slightly larger.

22       Q    Do Winston cigarettes have vent holes in them?

23       A    They didn't always, but over time, like most of

24   the regular brands, the full strength brands, they also

25   added filter venting to Winston.

1       Q    All riqht.  You mentioned before I think when

2   we started this that you had done some work for the

3   American Cancer Society; is that correct?

4       A    Correct.

5       Q    And you talked about the New York stop smokinq

6   line that you established.

7             Let me ask you.  What was Smart Move?  What was

8   that pamphlet?

9       A    It' s a stop smokinq self help quide that I

10   developed for the Cancer Society in the late 80's that

11   they use.  So if you call the Cancer Society and want

12   help in quit smokinq they send you a pamphlet in the

13   mail.  It was desiqned to fit in a leqal size � you

14   know, reqular size business envelope.  So pretty small.

15             It's just a little pamphlet, and it basically

16   provided motivation to people to try to make a quit

17   attempt and follow throuqh with it.

18       Q    And in that pamphlet you had three questions

19   for people as to whether they were ready to try to quit

20   smokinq.  What were the three questions?

21       A    Well, are you motivated?  Are you ready to

22   make � do you want to quit smokinq?  Are you willing to

23   make some changes in your daily routine?  Because you

24   have to change your routine.  Are you willing to put up

25   with some discomfort after you quit?  Because of the

1   withdrawal that comes.

2             Those were the three questions right in the

3   beginning of the guide.  It said, if you answer yes to

4   these questions then you're ready to make a quit

5   attempt, you can be successful, is what it says, because

6   the first step is trying to quit.

7       Q    And so does that mean that anybody who answers

8   those three questions could just put down cigarettes and

9   walk away?

10       A    No, not at all.  That would be a

11   misinterpretation if somebody thought that.  If you

12   answer � it was a readiness test, to see if you're

13   ready to make a quit attempt.  The guide then is broken

14   up into why you should stop smoking, talking about risks

15   and benefits of smoking, making changes to your routine,

16   setting a plan.  That was the second part of the guide.

17   And then dealing with nicotine addiction and nicotine

18   withdrawal and relapse, which is � we talk about in the

19   guide, because most people who quit end up relapsing

20   back to smoking again.

21       Q    That Smart Move pamphlet that came out was in

22   the 80 ' s; is that right?

23       A    Yeah.  I wrote it for them in 1987.  I think

24   they first printed it in '88, and then reprinted it

25   again.  It basically went on for about a decade or so.

1       Q    Based on your experience with smokers, what is

2   the success rate for a smoker on a quit attempt?  When

3   someone says I'm going to try to quit and makes an

4   honest effort to quit, what is their success rate in

5   quitting smoking cigarettes on any given attempt?

6       A    Usually under 5 percent.  So of 100 people who

7   try only about 5 are successful in quitting, my

8   experience if they do nothing.  If they go to a class,

9   use patches, gum, you know, use the whole shebang, you

10   can increase the odds, but it's still there.  Success

11   rates at a year following people are only about 20 to 30

12   percent.

13             So you can increase the odds of quitting with

14   some of the medications that are now available, but most

15   people still end up relapsing.

16       Q    You talked about medication.  Chantix is a

17   nowadays medication that's available.

19   the most cutting edge �

22       A    Yeah, even with the most � you know, like,

23   Chantix, which is prescription medication now, out in

24   2006, the quit rates are about 20, 30 percent.

1       A    No, it came out in 2006.

2       Q    When did patches come out, nicotine patches by

3   prescription, where you had to qet it from a doctor?

4       A    December '92, I believe.

5       Q    Okay.  Now, over the last 50 years there have

6   been a lot of people who have been able to quit smokinq.

7   Is that fair?

8       A    Sure.  On averaqe you qet about 2 percent quit

9   rates every year.  You know, 2 percentaqe points of

10   smokers who become former smokers.

11       Q    And that's over the last 50 years or so?

12       A    Yeah.  If you accumulate that over time it

13   becomes millions and millions of Americans who have quit

14   smokinq.

15       Q    But on any individual year how many are

16   successful in doinq that?

17       A    If you're quittinq unassisted it's 5 percent or

18   less.  If you use some quit aids, which are more recent,

19   actually their availability, it qoes up slightly, but

20   still the majority of people quit end up relapsing back

21   to smoking again.

22       Q    2 percent means about how many people a year?

23   About a million a year?

24       A    Something like that, yes.

1       A    Yes.  Because you're talking about a large

2   number of smokers that you would have of millions, like

3   60, 70 million smokers in this country.  So knocking

4   that done 2 percent a year is about a million, 2 million

5   people.

6       Q    Dr. Cummings, we have talked about a lot of

7   different things here, but what I would like to ask as

8   we wrap up here is, when we talked about things going

9   back to the 30's all the way through the 90's and even

10   to today, when we talked about things that were

11   happening in the 40's and 50's and 60's, why is this

12   evidence important to understanding what would have been

13   going on in the life of someone who was born in 1936 to

14   understand the context?

15       A    Somebody born in that period really grew up at

16   the time when it was normal and acceptable to smoke, and

17   when the industry really acted in a conspiratorial way

18   to conceal the truth about smoking.

19             So they would be right in the � they would be

20   affected by those actions that I talked about in my

21   testimony.

22            MR. WALKER:  Objection, Your Honor.  No

23       foundation as to the effect of what he talked about

24       on any individual smoker.  And I move to strike.

1       answered the actual question.

2            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

3       Q    When you combine the controversy that was

4   created by the tobacco companies, combine that with what

5   you know about nicotine and addiction, how does that

6   affect the rational of someone in not trying to stop or

7   not being able to stop smoking?

8            MR. WALKER:  Same objection, Your Honor.  The

9       effect on the rational of someone is not an

10       appropriate question.

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  I'm talking about � just to be

12        clear �

13             THE COURT:  Well, then rephrase your question.

14            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

15       Q    Based upon your studies, Dr. Cummings,

16   behaviors of smokers in general, how does creating doubt

17   interact with a person who is addicted to nicotine as

18   far as the ability to quit smoking?

19            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I have the same

20       objection.  The foundation has not been laid for

21       that type of causation opinion, and I don't think he

22        can give that.

2 3                            THE COURT:  Overruled.

24       A    Basically the addictiveness makes it hard for

25   somebody to stop, and combining that with the campaign

1   of doubt and controversy that went on basically gave

2   people an excuse to keep smoking and not even try to

3   quit.

4       Q    Based upon your review of the internal

5   documents of the defendants, were they aware, including

6   R.J. Reynolds, that because of the controversy they

7   created that millions of smokers didn't even try to stop

8   smoking for decades?

9       A    Yes, they were, and they talked about them in

10   their internal documents, specifically targeting heavy

11   smokers for the controversy.

12            MR. PRYSOCK:  Thank you, Dr. Cummings.  That's

13       all the questions I have.

14             THE COURT:  Okay.  Well, we will take a break,

15       and it is 22 after.  Please be back at a quarter of

16       3.  Remember do not discuss this case with anybody

17       or among yourselves.

18             (The jury withdrew to the jury room.)

19             (Short break.)

2 0                            THE COURT:  Go ahead.

21            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, the first issue is the

22       plaintiff's pretrial had moved � actually filed a

23       motion in limine to preclude us from questioning the

24       witness about statistics relating to smoking

25       cessation and quitting.  There was some back and

Page 1619 forth in the hearing about whether we had to do a

proffer, and that discussion continued into opening

statements.

I just want to address it now, because I think there's been a waiver of that argument.  Mr. Prysock �

THE COURT: That was � if that was a position taken, he clearly asked this witness about attempts and the ability to quit.

MR. WALKER:  I agree.  I just want to make sure when I get into that I'm not violating an order.

The second issue, Your Honor, by our count Mr. Prysock and Dr. Cummings together have used almost ten hours of time and about 70, 75 different exhibits, and I believe that for me to fairly address those topics and those exhibits I need about 5 to 6 hours of cross, and it's going to be almost 3 o'clock when we start.

I'm raising it for two reasons.  One, I don't think it's fair for to me, to our side, even to the jury, to keep the jurors here until 8, 9 o'clock at night just for my cross.  That doesn't even address redirect.

Second, I don't even think that Dr. Cummings � and maybe at the appropriate time we can ask him.

1       He testified last week that he has to be on a plane

2       at some point today.  I'm not even sure that he has

3       the ability to stay here the lenqth of time that

4       would be required to complete his testimony today.

5       So I would make the request that we not try to

6       squeeze in my cross, whatever redirect that they may |

7       have in however much time there is between now and

8       Dr. Cumminqs' fliqht, stop at a time when we would

9       normally stop and require Dr. Cumminqs to come back

10       and complete my cross and whatever is left.

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  If the cross is qoinq, and there

12        is still leqitimate cross qoinq, I don't have a

13       problem.  I think he can come back Friday and we can |

14        finish him then, if that's necessary.  I suqqest we

15       do as much as we can, see how lonq it's qoinq.

16             I think I told the court he does have to fly

17       out toniqht for the AG � the conference of all the

18       AG's.

19             THE COURT:  He testified to that.  But when � 2 0                what time is his fliqht?

21            MR. PRYSOCK:  7:30, but it's a straiqht shot to f

22       the airport.

23             THE COURT:  It's not a straiqht shot at 5:30.

2 4                           MR. PRYSOCK:  I didn't mean that.  I mean he's

25                leavinq directly from here to the airport.

examination that he will probably have to come back.

I would like to confirm with him.

Where is he?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Outside.  I've already asked him. He can come back Friday.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.  Let me make sure. (Off the record.) (The trial continues in Volume 21.)

21
	what would have been important to know, I guess, in

1   into this case that the smoker at issue in this case was

2   named John Price, right?

3       A    That's right.

4       Q    And you probably knew by the time that you got

5   to the witness stand last Friday that you were going to

6   be the first witness in this case about John Price,

7   right?

8       A    I did discover that.

9       Q    Okay.  And because you know that, you know that

10   you are at least in this moment the only witness who has

11   yet testified in this case about John Price, right?

12       A    Correct.

13       Q    And you've been testifying as I just mentioned

14   since Friday morning, right?

15       A    In this case, yes.

16       Q    Okay.  Sure.  I don't mean generally.  I want

17   to talk to some things that have happened before you got

18   to the witness stand in this case.  You understand that

19   you were disclosed in this case as a generic witness, 2 0        right?

21       A    Yes, I do.

22       Q    And you were hired to give generic testimony in |

23   this case, right?

2 4       A    Correct.                                                                                          f

1   Price was born, maybe when he passed away and a little

2   bit of information about the brands that he smoked, your

3   testimony by and large has been what we might call

4   generic, right?

5       A    Yes.

6       Q    Essentially, the testimony that you gave in

7   this case is the same kind of testimony that you always

8   tell when you testify in these types of cases regardless

9   of the facts of the individual case; is that right?

10       A    Well, in some of the individual cases I give

11   case specific testimony but as to the generic issues,

12   it's the same testimony that I give in every case.

13       Q    Okay.  So you're hired to be generic.  You're

14   disclosed to give generic testimony, and then at some

15   point before we got here in this trial, I had an

16   opportunity to take your deposition, right?

17       A    That's right.

18       Q    And a deposition as the jurors have heard is

19   basically where you and I and Ms. Prentice's lawyers are

20   in a room or maybe in this case over the telephone and

21   questions are asked of you about what you're going to

22   talk about in the case; is that right?

23       A    That's true.

24       Q    Okay.  And at your deposition I asked you what

25   materials, if any, you had received that were specific

3       Q    And you gave me at that time Mr. Price's one

4   page death certificate, right?

5       A    That's right.

6       Q    And you used his one page death certificate to

7   know the year that he was born, right?

8       A    That's correct.

9       Q    And also at your deposition when I asked you

10   for materials that you had received specific to John

11   Price, you gave me this sheet of paper called Price Case

12   Interrogatories Summary, right?

13       A    Correct.

14       Q    And that's a document that you received from

15   Ms. Prentice's lawyers, right?

16       A    Yes.

17       Q    And it basically has two or three paragraphs on

18   it, right?

19       A    Correct.

20       Q    One of the paragraphs is a portion of Mr.

21   Price's, John Price's, Interrogatories that he signed in

22   the case before he passed, right?

23       A    That's my understanding.

24       Q    But not all of them, not all of his

25   interrogatory answers.

1       A    That is true.

2       Q    And you didn't ask the lawyers for a copy of

3   the full set of Mr. Price's signed and sworn

4   interrogatory answers, did you?

5       A    I did not.

6       Q    Then there's another paragraph with exactly one

7   sentence that provides some information about what was

8   said in Mr. Price's deposition, his sworn testimony,

9   right?

10       A    That's right.

11       Q    And that's all the information that you

12   received about Mr. Price's deposition, right?

13       A    That is correct.

14       Q    And you didn't receive or ask for a copy of

15   what John Price's actual sworn testimony was in this

16   case, did you?

17       A    No, I did not.

18       Q    And many of the guestions that you answered

19   about John Price in this trial in front of this jury

20   were in response to hypotheticals put to you by Mr.

21   Prysock where he asked you to assume certain things

22   about John Price.  Do you remember that?

23       A    That is correct.

24       Q    All right.  Now, before I move on, I just want

25   to make sure.  These two pieces of paper that I just

1   asked you about, this, and maybe another email from

2   plaintiff's counsel about Mr. Price having COPD, that's

3   the sum total of information that you received in this

4   case about John Price.

5       A    That's true.

6       Q    All right.  You talked about a lot of different

7   topics in your testimony so far.  I'm going to follow-up |

8   with you about them.  As we move through them I'll ask

9   you some questions relating to your ability to apply

10   what you've said to Mr. Price, okay?

11       A    Okay.                                                                                                |

12       Q    All right.  First of all, you talked about the

13   information environment that you believe John Price grew |

14   up in, right?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    Okay.  And you talked about that in terms of

17   the information in the environment about what was known

18   during Mr. Price's lifetime about, for example, the

19   health risks of cigarette smoking and the addictive

20   nature of cigarettes, right?

21       A    True.                                                                                                f

22       Q    I want to be clear.  You were not given or even |

23   told about any portion of Mr. Price's deposition where

24   he described what people like his mother told him about

25   the health risks of cigarette smoking, were you?

1       A    I was not given that information.

2       Q    All right.  And you were not given the portion

3   of his deposition or even told about his sworn testimony

4   where he describes what he told his children about the

5   health risks of cigarette smoking, were you?

6       A    No.

7       Q    All right.  Well, let me follow-up with what

8   you talked about then.  You would agree that cigarette

9   smoking has been one of the most studied causes of

10   disease in human history, right?

11       A    I would agree with that.

12       Q    No other issue has received more attention from

13   the Surgeon General, for example, than cigarette

14   smoking, has it?

15       A    I would agree with that.

16       Q    In fact, you would agree that the dangers of

17   cigarette smoking have been discussed by the media in

18   this country for over 100 years.  True?

19       A    True.

2 0       Q    All right.  I want to show you some examples

21   and follow-up about your testimony about the information

22   environment that Mr. Price was born into.  You're

23   familiar with the Florida Health Notes, right?

1       Q    That's a reference to tobacco being addictive

2   from over 110 years ago, right?

3       A    The worst form of tobacco addiction.  And then

4   they get context for that which is why I mentioned the

5   full �

6            MR. PRYSOCK:  And, if we could read that next

7       paragraph that Dr. Cummings is referring to under

8       rule of completeness.

9            MR. WALKER:  Sure.

10       Q    I've been asked to read some more of what we

11   just read.  Will you bear with me?

12       A    Yes.

13       Q    Tell me if you're familiar with this.  Tell me

14   if it sounds like what you remember.  "Today the

15   cigarette is looked upon by all smokers as the very

16   worst form of tobacco addiction.  It is so cheap, it is

17   so generally inhaled, it is often so loaded with drugs

18   and so many times made from cigar stumps and street

19   scrapings, that there is every argument against its use. 2 0       Reverend James L. Hammond tells what he saw in a San

21   Francisco opium den in a room not more than 20 feet

22   square down three stories underground dimly lighted and

23   dingy, where the air was so foul it almost overcame you

24   as you stood in the entrance.  I found 12 Chinamen busy

25   at work sitting flat on the floor.  In the midst of

1   indescribable filth they were rolling cigarettes for the

2   American boys to smoke.  There was a great pile of

3   material in one corner of the room and we struck a

4   match, stooped down to examine it.  We found it was

5   cigar stumps and tobacco mixed with the vilest sewer

6   excretions."

7            And there's a dash and it says "the healthy

8   hole."

9            MR. WALKER:  Is that what you wanted me to

10       read?

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes.

12   BY MR. WALKER:

13       Q    All right.  Back to my question.  Does anything

14   I just read change the fact that 110 years ago tobacco

15   is being described as the � cigarettes as the very

16   worst form of tobacco addiction?

17       A    Sure.  They're talking, what you read, I would

18   say, the full context, is mixing it with other drugs in

19   an opium den.  Yeah, it's describing it as a filthy,

20   disgusting thing.

21       Q    I didn't ask you about the part about filthy or

22   disgusting.  My question is, cigarette smoking is

23   described as a tobacco addiction, right?

24       A    Well, it is described that way.  I don't

25   dispute what is written there.  But the concern at the

1   time in context was that the cigarettes were leading

2   young men, young boys into other forms of drug addiction f

3   including heroin addiction.

4       Q    All right.  And what we just read is also

5   describing something about the inhalability of

6   cigarettes, right?

7       A    That's right.

8       Q    And you know from your research that that was

9   something, this inhalability of cigarettes that you

10   talked about on direct, is something that's been

11   discussed going back to the late 1880s, right?

12       A    Sure.                                                                                                |

1            MR. WALKER:  May we pull that up, please?

2       Q    All right.  This is the page that Mr. Prysock

3   was just looking at that I just referenced.  Page 356.

4   These are remarks that were given in the document from

5   1887.  I want to call your attention to this part of it.

6   The deleterious effects of tobacco on the throat and

7   nose.  And do you see where it says there in 1887:

8   "Cigarette smoke is especially injurious because the

9   smoke is so universally inhaled causing pharyngitis,

10   laryngitis, and chronic irritation to the nose, not to

11   mention the injury it may occasion to trachea and

12   lungs."

13            Do you see that?

14       A    I do.                                                                                                |

15       Q    That's a recognition in 1887 that inhaled

16   tobacco could be especially injurious including to the

17   lungs, right?

18       A    I don't dispute that that is what is written

19   there.  I dispute the fact that that was well accepted 2 0       in the medical field at that time.

21       Q    You're disputing something I haven't asked you

22   about.  All I'm asking you is, in 1887, we know from

23   this periodical I just read from, that cigarette smoking |

24   is talked about being especially injurious because it's

25   inhalable and especially injurious to the lungs, right?

13       A    Yes, I've seen this one.

14       Q    "Public decided for no smoking.  There have

15   always been quite a number of very decent people who

16   could not understand why they should be forced to sit in

17   the stench of coffin nails, et cetera, simply because a

18   minority of smokers assumed the right to pollute the air

19   in this way."

20             Did I read that right?

21       A    You did.  This is in regards to the law, I

22   think, that was passed in Kansas City.

23       Q    What I really want to ask you about is this

24   reference to coffin nails.  Coffin nails is a reference

25   to cigarettes, right?

	A
	Yes.                                          i

2
	Q
	Over 100 years ago, right?

3
	A
	Yes.                                             I

4
	Q
	And the idea of that term coffin nails, you

5
	know from the history, is that a cigarette is another
	
6
	nail in
	your coffin, right?

7
	A
	Yes.                                             1

8
	Q
	And another slang term that came into use

9
	around
	the 1900s, which I won't dig out the reference,

10
	is the
	term cancer stick, right?

11
	A
	Correct.

12
	Q
	That's another term, a slang term that was

13
	being used to refer to cigarettes as far back as 100
	
14
	years a
	go.

15
	A
	Yeah.  It wasn't that common but you can find

16
	reference to it back then.
	
17
	Q
	All right.  So we stopped and looked at this

18
	1912 Fl
	orida Health Notes publication from the State

19
	Board o
	f Health but you're familiar with the reference

20
	to coff
	in nails in The Three Stooges movie from 1938,

21
	right?
	

22
	A
	Yes.                                             1

23
	Q
	Let's have a look at that clip so the jury will

24
	know what we were just talking about.
	
25
	A
	Sure .

2             (A video clip was played and transcribed by the

3       court reporter to the best of her ability as

4        follows:)

5            Oh, boy I hope I win this context.  It's a good

6       time.  It's time for the cigarette program.  That

7        concludes the musical portion of our program and now

8       ladies and gentlemen the winner of the coffin nails

9       cigarette contest.  The first prize of $50,000 goes

10       to Mr. Curley Howard of 1122 Livingston Terrace, New

11       York City.  Who did you say?  Curley Howard.

12       Thanks, toots.  Gentlemen, this registered letter

13        just arrived.  I thought it might be important.

14        It's the prize money.  What's happened here?  My

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q    Any excuse to play The Three Stooges.  But that

19   one at least uses that same term, coffin nails, and

20   that's part of what makes that humorous, right, the

21   reference to the Coffin Nails Cigarette Company?

22       A    Yes.  I think it is humorous.

23       Q    And that was from 1938, right?

24       A    Yes.

25       Q    All right.  Now, I want to stick with this time

1   period of the 1920s and the 1930s because you were asked

2   a lot of questions about what was known and what was

3   said about cigarette smoking, about tobacco being

4   addictive, being a drug, before 1936 when Mr. Price was

5   born.  Do you remember those questions?

6       A    Yes.

7       Q    Okay.  You're familiar with and in fact have

8   answered questions previously about textbooks from the

9   late 1920s, school textbooks, textbooks used in schools

10   talking about that very subject, right?

11       A    Yes.

12            MR. WALKER:  Can I have the Elmo, please?

13       Q    Let me show you one.  This one's called Science

14   and the Way to Health.  Do you see that?

15       A    I do.

16       Q    And the copyright date, I'll zoom in, is 1929.

17   Do you see that?

18       A    I do.

19       Q    And then in case there was any doubt that this

20   is a text used in schools, this volume introduces the

21   pupil to the "spirit of science in relation to healthful

22   living."

23            Do you see that?

24       A    Yes.

25       Q    Okay.  I want to show you on page 318 what's in

1   this 1929 school book about tobacco.  "Studies by

2   scientists show that tobacco contains a powerful

3   narcotic poison called nicotine."

4             Do you see that?

5       A    Yes.

6       Q    And then down below:  "Everybody agrees that

7   when used to excess tobacco is a vicious drug."

8             Do you see that?

9       A    Yes.

10       Q    And I haven't read everything in between but

11   there are references, for example, to the use of tobacco

12   causing rapid heart action, shortness of breath, and so

13   on, right?

14       A    Yes.  And the difference of opinion in the

15   field.

16       Q    Well, let me read the sentence that you just

17   referenced.

18       A    Sure.

19       Q    So we can have the whole sentence.  "Studies by

20   scientists show that tobacco contains a powerful

21   narcotic poison called nicotine.  There is a wide

22   difference of opinion among users of tobacco as to its

23   effect.  But there seems to be no evidence that a sound,

24   healthy person who has not formed the tobacco habit can

25   do better mental or physical work by using it.  The

1   evidence shows that the use of tobacco tends to cause

2   rapid heart action, shortness of breath, and palpitation

3   of the heart.  Physicians sometimes refer to certain

4   abnormal conditions of the heart as tobacco heart.

5   Tobacco heart sometimes causes death when the smoker is

6   put under severe physical strain or when there is an

7   acute disease like typhoid or pneumonia.  Surgeons

8   sometimes notice that tobacco users fail to rally after

9   an operation as a non-user would under light conditions.

10   The free use of tobacco sometimes causes increased blood

11   pressure, sleeplessness, and irritation of the nose and

12   throat.  Only one insurance company has published its

13   experience on tobacco users.  The New England Mutual

14   made a study covering 180,000 policy holders for a

15   period of 60 years.  This study shows that those who did

16   not use tobacco had a lower death rate.  In spite of the

17   enthusiastic comments of some tobacco users there is no

18   evidence that the use of this drug ever advances

19   healthful living.  Everybody agrees that when used to

20   excess, tobacco is a vicious drug."

21             Did I read that right?

22       A    You did.

23       Q    All right.  So this school book for pupils in

24   1929 before all those internal documents that you

25   showed, is referring to tobacco as a powerful narcotic

1   poison, right?

2       A    It is a poison.  Central nervous system poison.

3       Q    And a vicious drug, true?

4       A    We now know it's a vicious drug.  But that's

5   not the perception that you would find, that most people

6   had or reflected in the vast majority of textbooks if

7   they were even to mention cigarettes.

8       Q    I've not asked you about any of that.  All I'm

9   asking you is, in 1929, this school book is talking

10   about tobacco use, I'm sorry, tobacco containing a

11   powerful narcotic poison that's a vicious drug, right?

12       A    Yes.

13       Q    All right.  Let's keep moving forward in time.

14   You talked a little bit about Reader's Digest as one of

15   the magazines that was popular in America, right?

16       A    I did.

17       Q    And in particular in the 1930s, 40s, and 50s,

18   Reader's Digest was in fact the number one publication

19   in America, correct? 2 0       A    Right.

21       Q    Reader's Digest literally went into hundreds

22   and thousands of households across America.

23       A    That is true.

24       Q    Reader's Digest first published an article

25   describing smoking as a cause of cancer in 1924, right?

1       A    That's right.

2       Q    You're familiar with that article called I Quit

3   Smoking or Cooper's Last Stand � actually, sorry.  Let

4   me ask you about a different article.  Before we look at

5   the 1924 article, I want to ask you if you're familiar

6   with the later Reader's Digest article from April of

7   1964 about Cooper's Last Stand.

8       A    Yes.

9       Q    Okay.

10            MR. WALKER:  Let's pull that one up.

11       Q    And while this is on the screen, let me remind

12   or ask you if your testimony about Reader's Digest, you

13   had a slide about Reader's Digest where you said there

14   were only 36, only 36 was on your slide, only 36

15   articles about smoking and health in Reader's Digest,

16   right?

17       A    Between 1924 and 1966.

18       Q    Okay.  But you've seen this article from 1964

19   talking about the impact of those 36 articles, right?

20       A    Sure.

21       Q    And this is what it said:  "Since November 1924

22   the Reader's Digest has published 36 articles on smoking

23   and health.  The American Cancer Society has termed

24   Reader's Digest a profound influence in creating public

25   awareness of the risks involved in smoking."

	Right?

2
	A
	Yes.

3
	Q
	And in fact, the Surgeon General has also

4
	recognized that Reader's Digest articles had an impact
	
5
	on what
	Americans knew about the dangers of smoking,

6
	right?
	

7
	A
	They did.  I think it was mentioned in the '89

8
	Surgeon
	General's Report in the context.  It was one of

9
	the few
	publications in America that didn't take

10

	e ads .

11
	Q
	Let's move forward in time to 1935.  You're

12
	familiar
	with the article on giving up smoking, right?

13
	A
	Yes.

14
	Q
	All right.  This was an article from Reader's

15
	Digest.
	We haven't pulled it up yet.  But this is an

16
	article
	from Reader's Digest that, again, refers to

17
	nicotine
	as a drug, right?

18
	A
	Correct.

19
	Q
	There were articles in Reader's Digest

20
	referrin
	g to nicotine as a drug and reporting that

21
	people could actually be addicted to nicotine, right?
	
22
	A
	True .

23
	Q
	Let's look at this article.  1935 on giving up

24
	smoking.
	"Surely you, a rational being, are not going

25
	to admit
	yourself a slave to this � this drug."

3        Q    And the drug they're talking about is

4   cigarettes, right?

5       A    Correct.

6       Q    And they're talking about a smoker or somebody j

7   who's using cigarettes actually being a slave to

8   cigarettes, right?

9       A    That's right.

10        Q    In 1935.

11       A    Yeah.  I think this individual is recounting

12   his difficulty giving up cigarettes and going back and

13   forth between cigarettes and a pipe.

14        Q    All right.  Let's take a look at that then.

15   Let's have the next slide.  "Of course it is perfectly

16   easy to give up smoking.  One would not like to think

17   that one has become such a slave to tobacco that one

18   cannot do without it � a drug which weakens the heart,

19   damages the nerves, gives you cancer, and catarrh, and

20   so on.  The difficulty to my mind is not so much giving j

21   up smoking as going on giving it up."

22             Right?

2 3       A    That's right.

24        Q    Let's move to 1938.  So You're Going to Stop

	smoking
	as an addiction, that an individual is wrestling ji

	MR. WALKER:  Can we pull that up, please?

7
	Q
	"Sooner or later, nearly every cigarette smoker ij

8
	discovers that he is not smoking by choice but by habit,

1       A    That's right.

2       Q    All right.  Let's take a look then at 1940.  I

3   Quit Smoking, or Cooper's Last Stand.  This is from July

4   of 1940.  You're familiar with that one, right?

5       A    Correct.

6            MR. WALKER:  Can we pull that up?

7       Q    "For more than 40 years, I had sucked up

8   nicotine like a filling station sponge."

9            Right?

10       A    Correct.

11       Q    All right.

12       A    They reprinted this again in 1964.

13       Q    This and some of the other documents that we

14   looked at show that 80, 90, 100 years ago people were

15   talking about the fact that nicotine is in cigarettes,

16   right?

17       A    Yes.

18       Q    And at least in this � this is an example

19   among others of a person saying that they're smoking for

20   nicotine, right?

21       A    It says I've been smoking for 40 years and I

22   have sucked up nicotine like a filling station sponge."

23       Q    Let's look at the next year.  Nicotine

24   Knock-Out or the Slow Count, this time from 1941.  This

25   is an article by Gene Tunney, right?

1       A   Yes.

2       Q    Gene Tunney was a former heavyweight champion

3   of the world, correct?

4       A    Correct.

5       Q    You spoke on your direct examination about how

6   famous athletes sometimes were used at various points in

7   time to sell different products, right?

8       A    That's right.

9       Q    This is an example of a then famous athlete

10   talking about cigarette smoking, right?

11       A    Correct.  He's talking actually about Joe Louis

12   who was the heavy weight champion.  Gene Tunney, this

13   is � actually I think it's July � or December 7, 1941

14   where this article appears and of course he's in the

15   Navy in charge of their physical fitness program during

16   World War II and he's commenting how he could take on

17   Joe Louis then and knock him out because Joe Louis is a

18   smoker.

19       Q    Let's take a look at the passage that you were

20   just talking about.

21       A    Sure.

22       Q    Or actually a different passage.  This is on

23   page 21, please.  Okay.  "Heavy smoking has a positive

24   and demonstrably bad affect on longevity, physical and

25   nervous energy, and general health.  With every puff,

	heavy smokers shorten their own lives."
	
2
	
	Right?

3
	A
	Correct.

4
	Q
	That's what was in Reader's Digest in 1941?

5
	A
	Yes.  I think he was citing Dr. Raymond Pearl's

6
	research
	

7
	Q
	And he goes on to talk about nicotine, doesn't

8
	he?
	

9
	A
	He does.

10
	
	MR. WALKER:  Can we pull that up?

11
	Q
	"The cause of most of the trouble is, of

12
	course,
	nicotine.  No one has ever denied that nicotine

13
	is poison."
	
14
	
	There's another reference is there, nicotine

15
	being a
	poison, right?

16
	A
	Correct.  It's an insecticide.

17
	Q
	And this is now, what, 75 years ago?

18
	A
	Correct.

19
	Q
	Okay.  Let's look at the next � let's move to

20
	the bott
	om of the page.  Okay.  "This powerful poison is

21
	the source of all the 'pleasure' derived from smoking.
	
22
	It touch
	es on the mechanism by which the adrenal glands

1       Q    He's talking essentially about the effect of

2   nicotine in the body and he's doing it at least 20 years

3   before some of the documents you showed the jury, right?

4       A    True.

5       Q    All right.  Let's move further into the

6   forties.  You talked about a song called Smoke, Smoke,

7   Smoke That Cigarette, and you showed some kind of video

8   of it, right?

9       A    Right.

10       Q    It's almost like an early music video for Smoke

11   That Cigarette?

12       A    I guess.  Sure.

13       Q    Okay.

14       A    I think it was 1949.

15       Q    Right.  Certainly before MTV and VH1 and all

16   that, right?

17       A    That's true.  Before my time.

18       Q    Okay.  I'll accept your representation on that.

19   By the way, on Smoke, Smoke, Smoke That Cigarette, were

20   you provided a portion of Mr. Price's deposition or were

21   you told about it where John Price was asked about that

22   song?

2 3       A    No.

24       Q    Okay.  You said that this song was popular in

25   the 1940s and fifties but in fact it was made and remade

1   many times over the years and continued to be popular,

2   right?

3       A    Yeah.  I think I said that as well.

4       Q    Okay.  I want to show you a compilation that I

5   know you've seen before of some of the people who remade

6   the song over the years.

7       A    Sure.

8            MR. WALKER:  Do we have that ready?

9             (A video clip was played and transcribed by the

10       court reporter to the best of her ability as

11        follows:)

12             Now I'm a fellow with a heart of gold.  And the

13       ways of a gentleman, I wouldn't even harm a flea.

14       But if me and a certain character met the guy that

15       invented that cigarette, I'd murder that son of a

16       gun in the first degree.  It ain't because I don't

17        smoke myself, and I don't smoke.  They can be

18       killed.  I smoked them all my life and I ain't dead

19       yet.  But them nicotine slaves, they're all the

20        same.  And (inaudible) Parker Alabama, everything's

21       gotta stop while I have a cigarette.  Smoke, Smoke,

22        Smoke That Cigarette.  Puff, puff, puff, and if you

23       smoke yourself to death.  Tell St. Peter at the

24       golden gate that you hate to make him wait but you

25        just got to have an another cigarette.

2   BY MR. WALKER:

3       Q    All right.  Let's move to 1950.  You're

4   familiar with the Reader's Digest article, How Harmful

5   Are Cigarettes, right?

6       A    Correct.

7       Q    And by the way, before we show this, one of the

8   internal documents, you called them internal, secret,

9   whatever it was, from the 1970s was talking about the

10   role of nicotine and smoking, right?

11       A    Yes.

12       Q    Did you talk about that?

13       A    Uh-huh.

14       Q    But you know that as early as 1950 in this

15   article that we're about to look at, it's being publicly

16   discussed that nicotine is the essential ingredient in

17   smoking, right?

18       A    Yes.

19       Q    Let's pull that up.  This one's called How

20   Harmful Are Cigarettes.  Reader's Digest.  The most

21   popular magazine in America, January, 1950, correct? 2 2       A    Right.

23       Q    Let's pull up what's said about nicotine in

24   1950.  "Nicotine is the essential ingredient of tobacco.

25   It is what makes tobacco tobacco and not just another

1   weed."

2             Right?

3       A    You read that correctly.

4        Q    This is Reader's Digest saying back in 1950

5   that nicotine is one of the essential reasons that

6   people smoke.

7       A    No.  It says it's the essential ingredient in

8   tobacco.  And it distinguishes tobacco from other

9   plants.

10        Q    Haven't you testified previously that this

11   document informed the public in January of 1950 that

12   nicotine is the essential ingredient in, I guess, in

13   tobacco, right?

14       A    Yeah.  I don't dispute that that's written.

15        Q    That was the only distinction that you were

16   making is -- I said smoking and this says tobacco.

17   Right?

18       A    I'm not sure what you were trying to quote me

19   as having said in the past.  This document really is

20   trying to educate people about the early studies coming j

21   out about the danger of the smoking.

22             MR. PRYSOCK:  For the rule of completeness, if f

23       we could read the next paragraph.  The next three

24        sentences put it in context.  It's right up there. 2 5       When one smokes --

BY MR. WALKER:

1

2       Q    All right.  "When one smokes, most of the

3   nicotine escapes into the air.  About a third gets into

4   the mouth where a little is absorbed.  Of what goes into

5   the lungs, perhaps a fifth is absorbed.  The effect of

6   smoking a cigar is equal to that of four or five

7   cigarettes.  A pipe gives one (inaudible) about a

8   cigar."

9            MR. WALKER:  Is that what you wanted me to

10       read?

11       Q    Having read that, it's still true that in 1950,

12   the public had this information, this was not a secret

13   in 1950, that nicotine was the essential ingredient in

14   tobacco, right?

15       A    It was not a secret is that nicotine was in

16   tobacco.

17       Q    All right.  Let's move to 1952.  This one's

18   called Cancer By the Carton.  You're familiar with this

19   one, right?

2 0       A    I am.

21       Q    This one's actually a pretty famous well-known

22   article from Reader's Digest in the series, right?

23       A    Sure.

24       Q    And that title, Cancer By the Carton, the idea

25   is that when you're buying a carton of cigarettes you're

3       Q    That's a graphic, easy to understand title of

4   this particular article.

5       A    It's an accurate title.

6       Q    All right.  Now, this period in the 1950s,

7   that's the period of time when there was extensive media |

8   coverage about the potential harms associated with using |

9   cigarettes, right?

10       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

11       Q    Studies were being done, epidemiological

12   studies, it's the era of the 1950s when you have the

13   mouse painting studies and those were all being

14   publicized in the 1950s, right?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    And they were publicized perhaps first in

17   medical journals but then they made their way into

18   newspapers and magazines, like Reader's Digest.

19       A    Just like today.

20       Q    Newsweek was one of those popular magazines in

21   the 1950s that had that coverage, right?

2 2       A    Yes.                                                                                                  f

1       A    You would have to show me the article but I'm

2   familiar with the information environment in general in

3   this period.

4       Q    This is the one about the Wynder Graham

5   studies.

6       A    Yes.                                                                                                  1

8   smokes, the greater are his chances of being afflicted

9   with lung cancer."

10             Right?

11       A    Correct.

12       Q    That information was not a secret.  It was

13   right there in Newsweek magazine in 1950.

14       A    True.  It's talking about Dr. Wynder Graham's

15   case control study that was published in January.

16       Q    By the way, this reporting about the more a

17   person smokes, the greater are his chances of getting

18   lung cancer, that's about 15 or 16 years before there's

19   any type of label on cigarettes, right?

2 0       A    True.                                                                                                I

21       Q    Let's take a look at coverage of another study

22   from TIME magazine.  You're familiar with the coverage

23   of the ACS, American Cancer Society study from 1951?

1       A    Correct.

2       Q    Do you see that?

3       A    Yes.

4       Q    And we started talking about Newsweek.  Now

5   we're looking at TIME magazine.  That was another one of

6   the most popular news magazines in the 1950s, right?

7       A    Yes, it was.

8       Q    And it was reporting on what the American

9   Cancer Society's head statistician, the person who's in

10   charge of statistics, told the American Medical

11   Association, right?

12       A    Yes.  This is the Hammond, Horn study Clyde

13   Hammond there on the left smoking his pipe, along with

14   Daniel Horn also smoking a pipe.  And I can't see who

15   the other gentleman is.  But they're talking about the

16   presentation at the American Medical Association meeting

17   of their prospective study that they released early

18   findings at that meeting.

19       Q    And the findings that were being released about

20   smoking are described as show stopping, right?

21       A    Yeah.  While they're confirmatory, the

22   retrospective studies, but this is one of the first

23   prospective studies, certainly in the United States,

24   that had shown and confirm that cigarette smoking was

25   related to a higher risk of lung cancer, heart disease.

1            MR. WALKER:  Can we have the next slide please?

2       Q    Here's what it says:  "A last minute added

3   attraction staged by a performer who previously had been

4   most unwilling to get into the act stole the show at the

5   AMA convention.  The star, the American Cancer Society's

6   statistician Edward Cuyler Hammond, his show-stopping

7   material:  Figures proving that heavy cigarette smokers

8   die younger than non-smokers � mainly from heart

9   disease and cancer, note any cancer of the lung."

10             Did I read that correctly?

11       A    You did.

12       Q    And let's see.  TIME magazine didn't stop with

13   this one article.  They actually had a whole series of

14   articles entitled Smoking and Cancer that ran from 1950

15   through 1959, right?

16       A    They did.  I'm not sure if they ran from 1950.

17   But certainly from '54 to the end of the decade, I

18   believe, they did run.

19       Q    Let's look at the example from 1957.  Following

20   up on the American Cancer Study this time with a graph,

21   right, showing the results?

22       A    Right.  They published the results.  The one

23   was a presentation.  Now they've actually published the

24   findings in a medical journal and they have this graph

25   that shows the higher rates of pulmonary disease cancer,

1   and heart disease from smoker, from smoking.

2       Q    "Death rates from all causes combined are 68

3   percent higher for cigarette smokers than for

4   non-smokers.  The rates raise with the number of

5   cigarettes smoked daily."

6            Publicly available information in one of the

7   more popular news magazines of the day, right?

8       A    Sure.                                                                                                |

9       Q    I think you mentioned � I'm not sure if you

10   showed the LIFE magazine spread about the Wynder Graham

11   and Probinger study.  Did you show that one?

12       A    I think we did.  The Canasta pajamas where they |

13   had the pictures of the mice and mouse painting

14   experiment, yes, we did.

15       Q    I won't show it again.  But that study

16   obviously received a lot of publicity in that time

17   frame, 1953, '54, right?

18       A    Actually it was December 1953 and it was

19   picking up on Dr. Wynder Graham, Chroninger's paper and

20   cancer research that came out earlier in June of that

21   year.                                                                                                                    |

22       Q    The LIFE magazine one was in December but there

23   was also coverage in TIME magazine, Newsweek, and

24   Reader's Digest as well, right?

25       A    That is correct.  And actually the New York

1   Times.  I think we showed one of the medical meetings

2   where the stock prices had fallen but they were talking

3   about presentations by Dr. Wynder and others talking

4   about the risks of smoking.

5       Q    You talked about the Frank Statement.  I'm

6   moving forward in time.  January, 1954, right?

7       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

8       Q    And you're aware that the Surgeon General has

9   reported that when the Frank Statement was published in

10   January of 1954, it actually caused an increase in the

11   belief that smoking was dangerous.  Right?

12       A    I'm not sure of the Surgeon General has

13   concluded that but they do talk about a poll that was

14   done shortly after the Frank Statement came out that did |

15   show an increase.  In fact, it went from about 1 percent

16   saying cigarette smoking caused lung cancer in 1953 to,

17   I think a Gallup poll that indicates 6 percent of

18   smokers believe that, so it did go up.

19       Q    You mentioned Gallup polls.  Let's look at a

20   Gallup poll from 1954 after the Frank Statement and

21   after the mouse studies were being publicized.  Gallup

22   certainly is one of the most, if not the most famous

23   polling organizations in the country, right?

2 4       A    Sure.                                                                                                f

1   public awareness, about smoking, whether smoking was

2   harmful, whether smoking caused cancer and so on over

3   time, right?

4       A    They did.

5       Q    Okay.  Some of them simply asked whether the

6   respondents believed that cigarette smoking was harmful,

7   right?

8       A    Yes.

9       Q    All right.  And other polls asked questions

10   about what people had heard or read about cigarette

11   smoking, right?

12       A    That is true.  Actually the Gallup poll did

13   both of those.  They asked about whether people had

14   heard or read, whether they believed it was harmful and

15   then they did a detailed assessment of what they meant

16   if they said it was harmful.  That's where the 6 percent

17   lung cancer figure comes from in that '54 poll.

18       Q    You've gone a little bit past where I am right

19   now.  My question is there were polls done about what

20   people had heard or read like the things that were being

21   reported in the media, right?

22       A    That is true.

23       Q    And then there were other polls, sometimes the

24   same poll that talked about what people reported that

25   they believed about the health risks of smoking, right?

1       A    True.  They often were, as I pointed out,

2   contained in the same poll.

3       Q    Let's take a look first at what people had

4   heard or read in 1954 on this topic.  You're familiar

5   with the Gallup poll on that subject, right?

6       A    Yes.  90 percent had heard or read that �

7   something about the effects of smoking and cause of lung |

8   cancer.

9       Q    So you've almost got it memorized.  I don't.

10   The question was:  "Have you heard or read anything

11   recently to the effect that cigarette smoking may be a

12   cause of cancer of the lung?"

13            And 90 percent answered yes to that question,

14   right?

15       A    Yes.  They had heard or read something about

16   it.  In other words, people were getting exposed to the

17   information environment that was out there.

18       Q    Some of the same exposure in articles in

19   Reader's Digest, TIME, Newsweek, that we just looked at, 2 0        right?

21       A    Yes.  White Papers, the Frank Statement itself

22   appeared in over 400 papers so that would be something 2 3       that people probably saw.

24       Q    Same year, a belief poll from 1954 asking:  "Do f

25   you think cigarette smoking is harmful, or not?"

1             You're familiar with that poll, right?

2       A    That was also Gallup.  I think it said 60

3   percent.  70 percent.

4       Q    "Do you think cigarette smoking is harmful, or

5   not? "

6            Almost three-quarters of Americans in 1954

7   answered yes to that question, right?

8       A    Correct.  And then they do the follow-up asking |

9   about the specific harms.

10       Q    That's more than ten years before warning

11   labels went on the packages, right?

12       A    That is true.

13       Q    You showed, continuing in the 1950s you talked

14   about a television show called See it Now.

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    And that was with Edward R. Morrow, right?

17       A    That's right.  And he also had an assistant who |

18   did some of the interviewing.

19       Q    Okay.  Certainly Mr. Morrow was a very

20   respected journalist and a very well known one, right?

21       A    Yes, he was.

22       Q    And I think you pointed out in your direct

23   examination that the See it Now program actually ran two |

24   different episodes on the question of smoking and health f 2 5       in 1955, right?

1       A   Yes.

2       Q    You showed a couple of clips or at least one

3   clip from a tobacco spokesperson from that show.

4       A    I think Dr. Dupuis.

5       Q    Dr. Dupuis.  Okay.  But a person watching that

6   show would have seen members of the public health

7   community also appearing on the program, right?

8       A    Yes.  I believe Cuyler Hammond appeared,

9   Dr. Wynder appeared on that show.  They had

10   representatives from the National Cancer Institute on

11   the show.  They had Tim Heartnet from the TIRC who

12   appeared on the show.  Clarence Copefield who was

13   assigned to the advisory board director.

14       Q    I didn't ask you to list them all because we

15   won't be able to show the whole two-hour episode.  But

16   let's start with the first one you mentioned.

17            MR. WALKER:  Can we pull that up and show that

18       clip?

19             (A video clip was played and transcribed by the

20       court reporter to the best of her ability as

21        follows:)

1       Cancer Society began an extended study of the

2        smoking habits of American men.  Here is Dr. Hammond |

3       reporting on the results of the first two years.

4             It is now established in my opinion beyond a

5       reasonable doubt that cigarette smoking greatly

6       increases the probability of developing lung cancer.

7             In my opinion, people could be warned of the

8       dangers and they are being warned.  What they didn't

9       want to do, whether they were to smoke or not, is

10       their own business.

12   BY MR. WALKER:

13       Q    Dr. Cummings, you didn't show that clip in your |

14   direct examination, did you?

15       A    No.                                                                                                     |

18   would be happy for folks to see both shows.  They were

19   great.  They provided historical context of the debate. 2 0       Q    What you chose to show was just what the

21   tobacco company spokesperson said on the show, right?

22       A    We did show Dr. Dupuis who represented the

23   other companies because he was the head of the technical

24   research committee of the research of the companies when f

25   he said that if they ever found anything harmful which

3       A    � we would take it out �

4       Q    Dr. Cummings, you already showed that.  My

5   guestion to you is, you only showed the tobacco

6   spokesperson on the show, right?

7       A    That's true.

8       Q    If you were being fair to both sides about this

9   show, you would have shown both sides of the issue on

10   the show, correct?

12             THE COURT:  I can't hear you.

19       guestion is about how to fairly present this issue. 2 0                            THE COURT:  Sustained.

21   BY MR. WALKER:

22       Q    If you were trying to show the jury both sides

1   community said, true?

2             MR. PRYSOCK:  Same objection, Your Honor.

3             THE WITNESS:  True.

4             THE COURT:  Sustained.

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6       Q    Dr. Cummings, if I hadn't stood up and just

7   showed you what Dr. Hammond said on that show, the jury

8   would never have seen that, would they, from you?

9       A    I'm not sure what they're planning to use with

10   the other witnesses.

11        Q    Talking about in your testimony.

12       A    In my testimony, I have no problem.  We did

13   provide both sides of the issue.  We presented what

14   Dr. Burney was saying at the time in 1957, John Heller.

15   So I think it would be a mischaracterization of my

16   testimony and I would dispute, I think the way you're

17   trying to frame this, that I'm trying to present a bias

18   presentation.  That is not true at all.

19       Q    Because you would agree that the jury should

20   see both sides of the issue, right?

21       A    I have no problem with them seeing this.

22             MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection, Your Honor.  This is

23        the third time I've had to object.  The Court

24        sustained this.  It's an improper line of

25        questioning.

Honor.

THE COURT:  You can be heard at side bar.

MR. WALKER:  Thank you.

(The following took place at the bench:)

MR. WALKER:  Here's the issue, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  We'll start all over.  I would like to be responsive for the record.

MR. WALKER:  My issue, with this line of questioning, is that it reveals the bias of the witness.  He is a serial witness who routinely testifies that he plays a part in what the � of the presentation that's put together and consistently you'll see this as we go through the examination. He presents a misleading, one-sided presentation of the evidence and he will agree that he participated in the presentation of this issue.  It goes to his bias .

THE COURT:  Okay.  And I don't mind you doing whatever is necessary to demonstrate his bias.  I think that's totally appropriate.  I don't think it's appropriate for you to � I think � and the way you show the bias is that you showed that one side was presented from the same TV show in this particular instance but not the other side.  And

Page 1673 that it was in the same TV show.  But to say � to

then attempt for him to say, oh, yes, I am biased,

or words to that effect, I think is an inappropriate

method for cross-examination.

MR. WALKER:  May I ask a question?

THE COURT:  As soon as I finish.

MR. WALKER:  Yes, sir.  I'm sorry.

THE COURT:  You establish bias by showing that it was one-sided when both sides were available. That is putting on evidence and putting on facts. When you're going now to ask him an opinion about whether or not he is biased and it becomes very argumentative and it would be � and it's inappropriate in my opinion for it to be a subject of cross-examination.  And we can do this with every single witness.  But I think it's established that this was a TV show and only one side of the issue was presented.  I also know that a great deal of evidence, even though this man may have assisted in putting together the evidence, because I think that's what people do with witnesses, is sit down and try to figure it out, is controlled by what the lawyers decide is going to be asked and we aren't trying the lawyers in this case.

But I do think that you have � you established

Page 1674 a bias without trying to have him concede that he

agrees.

MR. WALKER:  I understand your ruling.  My question, which is separate from that, is Your Honor precluding me from eliciting the witness's admission that he deliberately showed one side and not the other side?  The difference between what I'm trying to show isn't just that he didn't show it but that it was deliberate on his part, him specifically, based on admissions he has given in other cases, and I think what Your Honor is telling me is that I'm not allowed to elicit from him that the omission of the other side of the story was intentional on his part.  I think that's what you're telling me.  And I just want to be sure that's clear for the record and I won't do it again if that's Your Honor's ruling.

THE COURT:  I don't think it's appropriate cross-examination to � I think to demonstrate bias is appropriate.  To get the person to agree that you've established a bias with them and that kind of questioning going on, it becomes argumentative and it's inappropriate.  If you want to proffer this witness as to what you're trying to get at right now, I'll consider the proffer.  But that's the reason I'm sustaining his objection.

1            MR. WALKER:  I would like to do a proffer.

2             THE COURT:  Sure.

3            MR. PRYSOCK:  And, just so it's clear, my other

4       problem with this is using the terms like

5       deliberate.  If you were going to be fair to this

19   questions.  The jury is not here.  I want to ask you

20   about your role in the creation and finalization of the

21   presentation that you went through with Mr. Prysock,

22   okay?

2 3       A    Okay.

1   you by plaintiff's counsel, was it?

2       A    That is true.

3        Q    You played a part in deciding � in the

4   selection process of deciding what materials, what

5   videos, what clips, what passages and so forth you

6   thought should be shown in your direct examination and

7   which passages perhaps shouldn't; is that true?

8       A    That is true.

9       Q    And �

10       A    Not entirely, but true to a large extent.

11        Q    What do you mean not entirely?  Did you play a

12   part in that process, or not?

13       A    Well, yes, I did.

14        Q    Okay.  So, for example, you've been in other

15   trials where this clip that you played on direct with

16   Mr. Prysock was played, right?

17       A    True.

18        Q    And you've been in other trials where then on

19   cross-examination the other part of the episode that I

20   played was shown, right?

21       A    Actually, I think the last trial I did, I

22   showed both.  I showed the Hammond clip.  I think I

23   showed the Wynder clip.  I showed the Heartnet clip.  I

24   showed the Dupuis clip because there was more time,

25   actually, available.

1       Q    So whatever the reasoning was in that case

2   versus this case, in some cases you've shown more than

3   was shown in this case.

4       A    That is true at trial.  My understanding is,

5   the full shows are put in as evidence.

6       Q    I'm not asking about that.  I'm asking about in

7   terms of what was shown.  And whether the part that I

8   showed gets shown or not is something that you influence

9   as the expert in the case, right?

10       A    No.

11       Q    Okay.  Your opinion about whether that part of

12   the clip should be shown carries no weight in the

13   process of putting together your presentation?

14       A    You would have to ask the attorneys what weight

15   it carries.  But certainly I talk about the topics.

16   They know the topics that I have researched and studied

17   and am an expert in, you know, giving testimony about.

18       Q    Did you make a decision, yes or no, about

19   whether to play the clip that I just showed you?

20            MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection.  Asked and answered.

21            MR. WALKER:  I have not asked the question,

22       Your Honor.

23             THE COURT:  Overruled.  We're conducting a

2   BY MR. WALKER:

3       Q    As to other passages and documents that we'll

4   look at, portions of videos, did you make any decisions

5   about what would and would not be shown?

6       A    The other clips you saw?

7            MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection.  This is work product

8       at this point deciding which things we're going to

9       play and not play.

10            MR. WALKER:  I've not asked anything about what

11       the lawyers wanted to do, Your Honor.

12             THE COURT:  Overruled.  I'm going to take the

13       proffer.

14             THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  Generally, these are the

15       materials that exist that I've provided to the

16       attorneys based on my research.

questions about -- I don't even mind you asking him

up until the time, did you make the decision, which

I doubt you will want to, but it's up to you, did

you make the decision as to not to put on something

else and you said no.

MR. WALKER:  Understood.

THE COURT:  But after that, I think it has become argumentative.  And your proffer was different than what was objected to and sustained earlier when you were talking about -- eliciting testimony to have this witness describe himself as biased.  I think that you showed both sides that --as it relates to him assisting and coming up with which materials.

But I don't think it's appropriate for him to do an argument over whether or not he considers himself biased or not.

3             THE COURT:  Well, I just want to put it in

4        context of what I was sustaining as far as an

5       objection so I went beyond what was on the table as

6       the proffer.

7            MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.

8             THE COURT:  And maybe we aren't communicating.

9            MR. WALKER:  Well, I understand what you're

10        saying about what's been spoken so far.  The reason

11        I'm pausing is because this witness routinely admits

12       that he has a bias, that he's rooting for one side

13       to win over the other side, and I didn't take Your

14       Honor to be saying I can't ask those questions.

15             THE COURT:  No.  But questions to try to have

16       him say I'm a tricky guy, I'm not � that becomes

17       very � I think it becomes very argumentative at

18       best.                                                                                                           |

19            MR. WALKER:  Very well, Your Honor.

2 0                           THE COURT:  And would be inappropriate

21       cross-examination.  I think you established what you |

22       want to by demonstrating that there are things that 2 3                are put in and things that are not put in.

24            MR. WALKER:  I think I understand the rules at

25       this point, Your Honor.  Thank you.

4   BY MR. WALKER:

5       Q    Dr. Cummings, right before we broke, you were

6   talking about some statements from Surgeon General

7   Burney and Dr. Heller.  I want to bring those up since

8   you mentioned them.

9            MR. WALKER:  May we have the first one, please?

10       Q    This is the first one that you were talking

11   about from Surgeon General Burney, right?

12       A    That's correct.

13       Q    "Our position is that we have informed the

14   public through the excellent coverage of the press,

15   radio, and TV."

16            And then the other was from Dr. Heller from the

17   National Cancer Institute, right?

18       A    Right.  This was at the congressional hearing

19   of �

20       Q    And the statement here from 1956:  "Newspapers,

21   radio, TV and other media have done an excellent job

22   covering this problem in a very objective job.  This is

23   an exceedingly valuable way of informing the public."

1   we've just been looking at, right?

2       A    Actually they were asking a question from

3   Congressmen that says what are you doing to educate the

4   public, and they were asked, this was their response.

5       Q    And the newspaper, radio, TV and other media

6   coverage would include the newspaper, magazine articles

7   and some of the things that were on TV that we looked

8   at, right?

9       A    Sure.  And, of course, they were being often

10   interviewed and asked about � to comment on the

11   research that was coming out at this time.

12       Q    You showed some clips from movies.  We're still

13   in the 1950s.  I want to show an example.  You're

14   familiar with From Here to Eternity.

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    That was with Frank Sinatra, right?

17       A    Correct.

18       Q    And that's a clip where he's using the word

19   nail as a reference to coffin nail, right?

20       A    Actually, I think he's using it in reference to

21   a cigarette, give me another nail.

22       Q    Well, okay.  But it's a reference to coffin

23   nail which is referring to cigarettes, right?

24       A    Sure.

3            Right?

4       A    That's correct.

5       Q    You've seen articles like that all over the

6   country, right?

7       A    Sure.

8            MR. PRYSOCK:  Do we have the full articles of

9       these?

10            MS. HUMPHRIES:  I gave them to you.

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  I'm sorry, counsel.  If you could

12       hold on just a second.  Are you introducing the full

13       article?

14            MR. WALKER:  I'm not introducing anything.  I'm

15        just asking the questions.

16            MR. PRYSOCK:  Okay.

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q    All right.  You said a couple of times �

19   before we leave the 1950s, you were asked questions a 2 0       number of times about tobacco companies denying that

21   cigarette smoking was addictive.  Isn't it true that

22   you're not aware of R. J. Reynolds ever making a

23   statement to the general public in the 1950s where they

24   denied that cigarette smoking was addictive?  That's

25   true, isn't it?

1       A    I'm not aware of R. J. Reynolds in the 1950s

2   making any statement about nicotine addiction period.

3        Q    Let me try that one again and see if you can

4   answer this question with a yes or a no.  Is it true,

5   Dr. Cummings, that you're not aware of R. J. Reynolds

6   Tobacco Company ever making a statement to the general

7   public in the 1950s where they denied that cigarette

8   smoking was addictive?

9       A    Yes.  For the reason that I indicated, which

10   is, I'm not familiar with them making any statement on

11   the topic of nicotine addiction period publicly.

12    Internally, very different.

13        Q    All right.  You're familiar with a book called

14   Tobacco:  Experimental and Clinical Studies by Larson,

15   Haag, and Silvette, right?

16       A    I am.

17        Q    And that book �

18             MR. WALKER:  I think we have a copy here.

19       Q    This is the book that's called, in some

20   circles, the green monster, right?

21       A    Correct.

22        Q    And it's called the green monster partly

23   because this is a long title, green monster is shorter,

24   right?

25       A    That's right.

1       Q    And because it's green, right?

2       A    Actually, I think it's a title that attorneys

3   have given the document, is my recollection of it.

4       Q    Wherever it comes from, you know what the green |

5   monster is, right?

6       A    Sure.  I've seen the green monster.  I've seen

7   the blue one, the yellow one, and the orange one because

8   they came out with different versions up until the

9   seventies.

10       Q    Well, the color part is obvious.  The one

11   reason it's called a monster is because it's thick and

12   heavy, right?

13       A    True.                                                                                                I

14       Q    Here's what I want to ask you about that.  That

15   book contains or reports on more than 6,000 articles on

16   experimental and clinical smoking and health studies,

17   right?

18       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

19       Q    Published in 1961?

2 0       A    Correct.                                                                                          I

21       Q    And it was funded by the TIRC, or the Tobacco

22   Industry Research Committee that you talked about with

23   Mr. Prysock at least in part, right?

24       A    Well, it was published, in other words, the

25   printing of it was paid for by the TIRC, actually the

Veritext Reporting Company 212-2 7 9-9424                        www.veritext.com                        212-490-3 430

1   funding for it was from the American Tobacco Company

2   because they had funded Mr. Larson or Dr. Larson and

3   Dr. Haag.

4       Q    This was a � this book was a key research tool

5   for the Surgeon General's committee that produced the

6   1964 Surgeon General's Report, right?

7       A    That is true.  They comment on the report in

8   the Surgeon General's Report saying they relied on this

9   source for articles published prior to 1958 and then

10   they relied on the National Library of Medicine for more

11   recent publications.

12       Q    And you continue to see that in later Surgeon

13   General's Reports referring to later versions of what

14   I've been calling the green monster, right?

15       A    True.  Up to 1975, I think, is when they

16   stopped printing them.

17       Q    All right.  We're talking about TIRC, that was

18   a subject you talked about with Mr. Prysock.  TIRC

19   funded research on nicotine and whether it was

20   addictive, didn't it?

21       A    They did.

22       Q    And the results of some of that research were

23   actually published in the literature, right?

24       A    Yes.  I've seen them.

25       Q    For example, you're familiar with the article

2
	was publ
	ished in the American Journal of Psychiatry in

3
	1962, 1963, right?
	
4
	A
	Correct.

5
	
	MR. WALKER:  Do we have that?  Can we pull up

6
	that
	article?

7
	Q
	Okay.  This is the article we were just talking ij

8
	about, right?
	
9
	A
	Yes, it is.

10
	Q
	And it was funded in part by TIRC, right?

11
	A
	That's right.

12
	Q
	It was also funded in part by the American

13
	Cancer S
	ociety, wasn't it?

14
	A
	Well, not necessarily this particular study but

15
	they're
	talking about the funding for the two scientists

16
	who wrot
	e the article.

17
	Q
	I see.

18
	A
	Right.  So they had funding from various

19
	sources.
	TIRC was one of them.  The cancer society was

20
	another.
	There might even be a third one in there.

21
	Q
	And this article that we'll take a look at

22
	actually
	has been cited by the Surgeon General, right?

23
	A
	Yes, it has.  Many times actually.

24
	Q
	So in the conclusion section of this, this was

25

1       A    Yeah.  It's not like a newspaper article or

2   something.  It was in the scientific journal.

3       Q    "Summary and conclusions:  The second

4   conclusion:  "Heavy cigarette smokers thus appear to be

5   true addicts showing not only social habituation but

6   mild physiologic withdrawal effects."

7             Right?

8       A    True.                                                                                                f

10   document that never made the light of day until sometime

11   in the nineties, is it?

12       A    No.  It is not.

13       Q    Okay.  All right.  You talked about � let's

14   move forward.  That was 1963, right?

15       A    '62, '63.

16       Q    '62, '63.  In 1964, the Surgeon General comes

17   out with the Surgeon General's Report that you talked

18   about, right?

19       A    Correct.                                                                                          |

20       Q    One of the conclusions of that report was that

21   cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer in men, 2 2        right?

2 3       A    Correct.                                                                                          1

13   of cigarette smoking in causing cancer of the lungs."

14             Right?

15       A    Correct.

17   over the country.  It was front page news right here in

5       Q    Same thing, this 1964 Surgeon General's Report

6   made a big splash in the magazine media, too, right?

7       A    It did.

8            MR. WALKER:  Can we have that one, please?

8             (A video clip was played and transcribed by the

11             This is a CBS News Extra on smoking and health.

12       The findings of the Surgeon General's committee.

13            Almost from the moment that cigarettes were

14        introduced, they were attacked.  But the attacks

15       took a new turn ten years ago and culminated in

16       today's report by the Surgeon General's committee.

17       This in summary is what the committee says.

18       Cigarette smoking is a major cause of lung cancer in

19       men and data on women smokers points the same way.

20       Cigarette smoking is a significant cause of cancer

21       of the larynx and probably the most important cause

22       of chronic bronchitis.  Cigarette smoking may be

23       related to other lung diseases.  Male smokers have a

24       much higher death rate from heart disease.  Although

25       it's not proven that smoking is the cause.

Page 1694 On the question of filters, the committee said

there is no evidence that they do any good.  But it

didn't exclude the possibility that an effective

filter might be developed.

In short, the committee says if you smoke cigarettes, you increase your chances of dying early.  The sooner you start, the more you smoke, the more you inhale, the worse your chances are. The Surgeon General's committee presented its report at a news conference in Washington.

After long and exhaustive deliberations the committee has reached the overall judgment that cigarette smoking is a health hazard of sufficient importance to the United States to warrant remedial action.  This overall judgment was supported by many converging lines of evidence as well as by data indicating that cigarette smoking is related to higher death rates in a number of disease categories.

More specifically, the committee states on page 61 of the report, and I quote:  "In view of the continuing and mounting evidence from many sources, it is the judgment of the committee that cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and to the overall death

1       rate.

2             There is no question but what smoking has meant

3       a great deal to a great many people.  An old smoker

4       never forgets how he started.  And through the

5       lifetimes of a lot of us, cigarettes have been an

6       intimate and reassuring companion.  The familiar

7        slogans, the familiar packages have been a part of

8       our lives.  It's like being told that an old friend

9       has all along been betraying you.  In a case like

10       that, you give the old friend every possible chance

11       before you finally decide to believe what you have

12       been told and maybe even then you give him a chance

13       to reform.

14             In this time of our country it comes down to

15       you, whether you like it or not.  No one is going to

16       forbid an adult to smoke and it is now quite clear

17       no one is going to tell him it's good for him

18       either.  The decision is his.  The decision and the

19       health that may depend on it on it.  This is Harry

20       Reasoner.  Good night.

1   contend show that filtered cigarettes don't do any good,

2   right?

3       A    I did.

4       Q    And during the clip that we just saw with Harry

5   Reasoner on CBS news, that clip was from 50 years ago,

6   right?

7       A    That's true.

8       Q    And in that clip with Harry Reasoner from 50

9   years ago, in addition to reporting on the Surgeon

10   General findings, he references the findings that

11   filters � that there's no evidence that filters do any

12   good, right?

13       A    That was the finding of the Surgeon General's

14   advisory committee.

15       Q    And he presented that finding on national

16   television news, right?

17       A    He presented it accurately because they did not

18   have evidence at that point.  Filters were really a

19   novelty that had been introduced in the fifties and so

20   there hadn't been sufficient time to know whether

21   filters would make a difference or not.

22       Q    My question is, in 1964, when that aired, it

23   was no secret that there was no evidence that filters

24   did any good because Harry Reasoner just said it on TV.

25       A    Wrong.  It was a big secret to the American

1   public who bought into filters and switched in large

2   numbers from non filtered to filtered cigarettes because

3   they believe that the filter offered a benefit by

4   removing something from the cigarette that may be

5   harmful.  Sort of hedging your bets.

6       Q    Right.

7       A    And that's exactly what the internal business

8   marketing documents of the company showed for the

9   marketing of cigarettes.

10       Q    You talked about that in your testimony.  But

11   you did remind me of something.  You said the American

12   public believed and then you started using the word

13   they.  I just want to be clear.  You haven't been

14   provided any of John Price's testimony talking about

15   whether he was influenced by filters or thought they

16   were safer for him.

17       A    I haven't been presented with his testimony.

18       Q    Okay.  All right.  We were in the 1960s now.

19   We haven't looked at a movie yet from the 1960.  You're

20   familiar with Sweet Bird of Youth from 1962, right?

21       A    Sorry.  That's a new one on me.

22       Q    Paul Newman and Geraldine Page?

2 3       A    I don't deny it.  There were many movies

24   obviously.  Bye-Bye, Birdie, for example.  That was one

25   I'm familiar with.

1   of the jam.

2       Q    I can see that you remember it.

3       A    I think I saw it the other night.

4       Q    In all seriousness, three clips from the

5   sixties, one referencing cancer, one referencing

6   cigarettes being bad for the chest, and the last one

7   here about nicotine, right?

9       Q    Okay.  And if we go back to newspapers in the

10   1960s, it wouldn't surprise you that we can find more

11   examples from Utica, New York, of coverage of the risks

12   of cigarette smoking in the news?

13       A    Yes.  I'm familiar with Utica, New York, and

14   coverage in the newspaper both pro and con.

15       Q    Utica Observer-Dispatch, Detour to Early Death,

16   Smoking Death Rate, Increase Length in Report, all in

17   the 1960s, do you see that?

18       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

19       Q    That's consistent with coverage you've seen in

20   other places, too, right?

21       A    Typically when you see these full articles

22   you'll get the statement talking about usually a

23   research finding or a government report that has come

24   out and then the position from the companies if you look f

25   at the full article.

1       Q    Interesting question.  Usually the position

2   from the companies in most of these articles is not in

3   the headline, true?

4       A    I've seen it both ways.

5       Q    I'm not asking you if you've seen it.  I'm

6   talking about in most cases, it's not in the headline.

7   The headlines are like what we see here, right?

8       A    Again, I've seen headlines both ways.  To be

9   honest with you.  I've seen those that have been framed

10   through the Tobacco Institute �

11       Q    Dr. Cummings �

12       A    � you can see the headlines and I've seen �

13       Q    Dr. Cummings, I want you to try to focus on

14   what I'm asking you.  I'm not asking you whether it's

15   ever happened.  I'm asking you in this newspaper

16   coverage about the studies linking an increased death

17   rate to smoking, that's typically what goes into the

18   headline, right?

19       A    I've seen it both ways is the way I answered

20   the question.  I haven't quantified one versus the

21   other.

22       Q    If there was some statement later in the

23   article towards the end, for example, where some tobacco

24   company responded to it, that's a possibility, right?

25       A    Sure.

1       Q    And in this case, though, you haven't been told |

2   or provided any information from John Price's deposition f

3   to know whether he primarily was looking at headlines or |

4   whether he was reading deep into the article where he

5   might find a tobacco response.

6       A    No.  I didn't review his testimony.

7       Q    Let's talk about warning labels.  You told the

8   jury about the labels that were placed on cigarette

9   packages starting in January 1966, right?

10       A    Right.

11       Q    And that was:  "Caution, cigarette smoking may

12   be hazardous to your health," right?

13       A    Correct.

14       Q    With respect to that warning that went on the

15   packages in 1966, you have not been provided and you

16   have not been told anything about what John Price's

17   testimony was with respect to that warning; is that

18   right?

19       A    That is right.

2 0       Q    I believe you mentioned and maybe even showed

21   at least one public service announcement, right?

22       A    Right.  I think we showed William Talin, public | 2 3       service announcement.

24       Q    That's just one of many different public

25   service announcements that aired in the 1960s, right?

1       A    That's true.

2       Q    Some of the public service announcements that

3   ran after the warnings came out actually talked about

4   warnings, right?  You've seen the American Cancer

5   Society clip about warnings?

6       A    Yes.  I think they were highlighting the new

1
	A
	I do.

2
	Q
	Then it says:  "Tompkins Theory.  In this

3
	theory smoking is seen as an aide to handling human
	
4
	emotions
	It stresses the importance of positive as

5
	well as
	of negative emotions."

6
	
	And it goes on to describe what Tompkins

7
	believes
	, right?

8
	A
	Correct.

9
	Q
	And that's referring to Silvan Tompkins, isn't

10
	it?
	

11
	A
	Correct.

12
	Q
	And can you agree with me that what comes

13
	after, under the categories of Tompkins Theory is not
	
14
	the theory of someone at Brown & Williamson, but is
	
15
	simply a
	paraphrasing and explanation of a theory put

16
	forth by
	this Silvan Tompkins; is that right?

17
	A
	Correct.  It's a review or summary of

18
	literature that he had published on why people smoke.
	
19
	Q
	Including this language here about addictive

20
	smoking
	and referring to addictive smokers, right?

21
	A
	Correct.

22
	Q
	What year was this document?

23
	A
	I believe it's 1974, '75, something in that

24
	area.

1   document from 1966.

2            MR. WALKER:  And, this is a self authenticating

3       document, AGX 001764.

4       Q    Public Health Reports.  See that?  March, 1966?

5       A    I do.

6       Q    Public Health Reports.  And this is put out by 7

8       A    U.S. Public Health Service.

9       Q    The U.S. Public Health Service.  The same

10   government agency that puts out the Surgeon General

11   reports.

12       A    That is true.

13       Q    Let's look inside this 1966 document.  By the

14   way, this document that's put out by the U.S. Public

15   Health Service is not an internal, secret document that

16   was not released to the public until sometime in the

17   1990s, is it?

18       A    True.  It's a scientific journal.  I've

19   published in it several times.

20       Q    In this scientific public journal, it says:

21   "The key to understanding smoking behavior is found in

22   affect, said Dr. Silvan Tompkins of the Center for

23   Research and Cognition and Affect, City University of 2 4       New York."

25                           That's the same Silvan Tompkins we were just

1   talking about, right?

2       A    Yes, it is.

3       Q    All right.  And in this document, Dr. Tompkins'

4   theory is explained.  There's a lead-in paragraph

5   talking about smoking also can be learned to relieve any

6   negative affect, invoke any positive affect.  Do you see

7   that?

8       A    I do.

9       Q    And then instead of A, B, C and D, in this

10   document we have 1, 2, 3, and 4, right?

11       A    That's right.

12       Q    And the fourth item, like the fourth item in

13   this document, 1974, in 1966, the fourth item is talking

14   about addictive smoking, right?

15       A    That's right.

16       Q    Same as the '74 document that you said was

17   internal and secret to B&W.

18       A    The document was internal to B&W and, yes, it

19   appears that their advertising firm has extracted

20   Dr. Tompkins' theory about why people smoke, correct.

21       Q    In this publicly available document from the

22   U.S. Health Service, the same information is provided:

23   "The psychologically addicted person is always aware of

24   not smoking when he is not."

25            Do you see that?

2
	Q
	That's the same as what you read from this

	document
	:  "He is always aware that he is not smoking

4
	whenever
	this occurs."

5
	
	Basically the same information,, right?

6
	A
	Yes.  Basically the same.

	Q
	Here it says:  "The addicted person suffers

8
	whenever
	he is without a cigarette."

9
	
	Right?

10
	A
	That's right.

11
	Q
	That's similar to the question you were asked

12
	about here:  "The addicted smoker suffers whenever he is
	
13
	without a cigarette."
	
14
	
	Right?

15
	A
	That's right.

	Q
	Why didn't you tell � let me ask you a

17
	different question.  Do you agree with me that you did
	
18
	not show
	the jury this same information from Silvan

19
	Tompkins
	that was in a publicly available document eight

20
	years be.
	core this secret one that you showed the jury?

21
	A
	No.  What I showed you was the internal

22
	business
	record from Brown & Williamson where they had

23
	reviewed
	a variety of theories and explanations for why

24
	people smoke.  They conducted focus groups with young
	
25
	people for their marketing purposes.  And they provided

2   Tobacco Company.

3       Q    Did you know about this document from 1966?

4       A    Yes.  I'm familiar with the Dr. Tompkins' work

5   and D. Daniel Horn's, whose theory was also discussed in

6   the document.

7       Q    Whose decision was it to show this document but

8   not this document?

9            MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection.  Improper question.

10             THE COURT:  Sustained.

11            MR. WALKER:  I believe that was � this was

12       discussed earlier.

13       Q    I'll ask you a different question.

14             THE COURT:  If you can phrase it the way you

15       did it on the proffer, that's a different deal.

16            MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.

17       Q    Whose decision was it not to show this

18   document?

19       A    It was no decision not to show any documents.

20   I chose to select documents from the tobacco

21   manufacturers and what they were studying and they said

22   they were not studying young people publicly when in

23   fact they were looking in detail at the reasons why

24   young people smoke.

Page 1712 That's the purpose of this document.

I have not said anything to you about young

That's what the document was about. You showed a document that made statements about addicted smokers, right? Yes.

8       Q    And you did it in the context of what you said

9   was a secret, internal company document that wasn't

10   released to the public until the nineties, true?

11       A    That is true.

12       Q    And in fact, the same statements that you

13   showed the jury from that supposedly secret document had

14   been made publicly eight years earlier in something put

15   out by the U.S. Public Health Service, true?

16            MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection, Your Honor.  That

17       misstates the direct testimony of the other portions

19             THE COURT:  Overruled. 2 0   BY MR. WALKER:

21       Q    I'm asking, is that true?

22       A    It is true that they highlighted the Tompkins

23   work.  That was not hidden.  It was a literature review

24   as well as focus groups that was conducted by Brown &

1   figuring out why young people smoke.  And that was

2   something that they did conceal because they said they

3   didn't study the smoking habits of young people.

4       Q    Dr. Cummings, let me show you another �

5            MR. WALKER:  This is � I have a copy for you.

6       This is another self authenticating publication.

7       Q    We were talking about magazines, right?

8       A    Sure.                                                                                                |

9       Q    I'll show you the magazine Mademoiselle.  See

10   that at the time?  I tried to highlight it.

11       A    Got it.

12       Q    And then down at the bottom, that's October 7,

13   1969.  Do you see that?

14       A    I do.                                                                                                |

15       Q    That's still five years before the secret

16   document you showed on direct, right?

17       A    Correct.

18       Q    Okay.  Look inside this document, Mademoiselle.

19   We see yet another reference to Dr. Silvan Tompkins, 2 0        right?

21       A    We do.                                                                                              |

22       Q    And maybe if I pull it out it'll be easier to

23   read.  It describes Dr. Silvan Tompkins as the man

2 4       everyone quotes when they're getting down to smoking.

2 5       Do you see that?

1       A   Yes.

2       Q    And that's what the 1974 document was doing.

3   It was just quoting this Silvan Tompkins in the passage

4   you read.

5       A    From that passage I would agree.  But other

6   portions of the document, no.  It was original research

7   from focus groups with young people.

8       Q    Once again, this time we have bullets.  We

9   don't have the A, B, C or D, or the 1, 2, 3.  However

10   it's organized, once again there's a section called the

11   addictive smoker, right?

12       A    That's right.

13       Q    Did you know about this article when you showed

14   that one from 1974?

15       A    I'm certainly familiar with Dr. Tompkins' work.

16       Q    Did you know that Dr. Tompkins' work including

17   the addicted smoker, the statements you showed from the

18   other document, had been published not just in medical

19   journals like ones you said you publish in, but in the

20   lay press, ordinary magazines?

21       A    I wasn't familiar with Mademoiselle and his

22   being cited there but that does not surprise me that he

23   was cited there.

24       Q    In any event, this is at least two more

25   examples of references to smoking being addicting in

1   1966 and 1969, right?

2       A    Yes.  Among other theories of why people smoke.

3       Q    All right.  Let's talk about 1968.  You

4   mentioned this briefly.  I just want to follow-up.  You

5   were talking about Daniel Horn.  And you said that he

6   made a statement but he didn't quote the statement.  I

7   want to make sure we're clear.  Daniel Horn was a very

8   well respected public health figure, right?

9       A    Sure.

10       Q    He was in 1968, at least, he was director of a

11   national clearinghouse on smoking and health?

12       A    True.

13       Q    And he was an expert doctor in the field of

14   smoking and health, wasn't he?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    All right.

17            MR. WALKER:  Let's pull up the one that shows

18       the full quote that you alluded to on direct.

19       Q    This is it, isn't it?  "You could stand on a

20   roof top and shout 'smoking is dangerous' at the top of

21   your lungs and you would not be telling anyone anything

22   they did not already know."

23             Is that right?

24       A    Yes.

1
	about Daniel Horn and this quote, you left out the part

2
	where he said "would not be telling anyone anything they ii

3
	did not already know," right?

4
	A    Not intentionally, believe me.

5
	Q    Let me ask you a question I asked you about the

6
	fifties before I leave the sixties.

7
	A    Okay.                                            ;

8
	Q    And that is this.  And if you could answer this

9
	with a yes or no, please do.  As far as you know, in all

10
	the 80 million pages of documents you talked about that

11
	you reviewed, you are not aware of R. J. Reynolds

12
	Tobacco Company ever making a statement to the general

13
	public in the 1960s where they denied that cigarette

14
	smoking was addictive, are you?

15
	A    I am not aware.  So that would be yes.  Because

16
	I'm not aware of any statements they made on that topic.

17
	Q    Let's move into the 1970s.

18
	A    Publicly.  Internally, something very

19
	different.

20
	Q    1970s.  The newspaper coverage in the Utica,

21
	New York area continues.

22
	MR. WALKER:  Do we have that?

1   changes, right?

2       A    That's true.

3       Q    And it becomes �

4            MR. WALKER:  Can we have it, please, so I don't |

5       read it wrong?

6       Q    "The Surgeon General has determined that

7   cigarette smoking is dangerous to your health."

8             Right?

9       A    That's right.

10       Q    And that's the warning that would remain on

11   cigarette packages for the next 15 years, right?

12       A    True.                                                                                                |

13       Q    Now, we talked about Gallup polling.  We looked |

14   at it from the 1950s.  And when we talked about it

15   earlier we talked about how Gallup continued to do these

16   polls over time, right?

17       A    That's right.

18       Q    And you're aware that in 1977 the Gallup

19   organization did a poll where they asked some of the

20   questions like, do you think cigarette smoking is

21   harmful to your health, right? 2 2       A    That's right.

23       Q    Now, a poll that asked if you think that

24   cigarette smoking is or is not harmful to your health,

25   that's a belief poll, right?

1       A    Yeah.  It's very general.  And so it would be

2   important to ask what that means to you.

3            MR. WALKER:  Let's pull up the results of that

4       poll from 1977, please.

5       Q    All right.  This is a poll � some of the polls

6   have a general figure and then there's a break out where

7   they just ask smokers, right?

8       A    That's true.

9       Q    Okay.                                                                                                |

10       A    Or sometimes they'll break out both smokers and |

11   non-smokers.

12       Q    Right.  These are the figures, do you agree,

13   from the Gallup poll from 1977 about smokers' responses

14   to the question, do you think that cigarette smoking is

15   or is not harmful to your health?

16            And 83 percent of cigarette smokers in 1977

17   said that they believed that cigarette smoking is

18   harmful to health, true?

19       A    True.                                                                                                |

20       Q    This is around the same time period as those

21   White Papers that you talked about today, right, late

22   1970s?                                                                                                                 |

23       A    Actually the White Papers started in '54 and

24   were reissued in '68 and every year between '68 and '84.

25       Q    Did you show White Papers today from the late

	seventies?

2
	A    I think we did.  I think we showed the 1979

3
	White Paper.

4
	Q    And that one would have been from same time

5
	period as this poll is conducted approximately, right?

6
	A    Roughly, yeah, two years.

7
	Q    By the way, on the subject of the White Papers,

8
	you showed a White Paper that contained a position on

9
	COPD, whether cigarette smoking caused COPD, right?

10
	A    That's right.

11
	Q    You weren't told or given any materials,

12
	including Mr. Price's actual Interrogatory Responses,

13
	were you, that indicate what Mr. Price thought about

14
	what caused his father's death.

15
	A    No.                                              i

16
	Q    All right.  In the 1970s, picking up with the

17
	movies, that was the year Superman was released, the

18
	first one, correct?

19
	A    Correct.

20
	Q    1978?                                            I

21
	A    Correct.

22
	Q    You showed a video with Ann Browder where there

23
	was a little bit of a clip and some questions about

24
	Superman movies, right?

25
	A    She was asked about that particular movie as

2   showing various other examples of product placements and

3   movies and sports sponsorship, sampling sponsorship of

4   concerts and so on.

5       Q    You're familiar with the scene in Superman that

6   talks about the risks of cigarette smoking, right?

7       A    Not in Superman 2.  Superman 2 was the movie

8   they showed the 13 clips.

9       Q    I'm asking you about Superman in 1978.  You're

10   familiar with the scene that talks about the risks of

11   cigarette smoking.

12       A    Superman 2 was the movie released in '78.  And

13   that did not talk about the health risks of smoking.

14   Lois Lane smoked in the movie.  There were 13

15   representations of Marlboro, every cab had Marlboro on

16   the side of it, every billboard was a Marlboro

17   billboard, the truck was a Marlboro truck �

18       Q    Dr. Cummings, you keep going back to that.  I'm

19   not asking you about that.  I want you to try to stay

20   focused on what I'm asking you.  I'm asking you about

21   the Superman movie where there's a scene talking about

22   the risks of smoking.  You're familiar with that scene,

23   aren't you?

24       A    Sure.  Superman 1, I think Superman flies in to

25   see Lois Lane and does his x-ray vision and says, you

2
	looks at her lungs and says, you're okay so far,

3
	something along those lines.

4
	Q    I don't mean to suggest that you can't do

5
	Superman justice but if we have the clip let's go ahead

6
	and show it.

	Ms. Lane, I've been thinking, you know, there

12
	must be a lot of questions about me that people in

14
	Of course, yes.

	You really shouldn't smoke, you know, Ms. Lane.

1             There must be a lot of questions about me that

8            MR. WALKER:  Thank you.

9       Q    All right.  So at this time a reference to lung

10   cancer in connection with smoking, right?

11       A    Correct.

12       Q    All right.  Same question now in the 1970s,

13   true or false.  In spite of the 80 million pages of

14   documents that you reviewed and talked about in this

15   case, you are not aware of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco

16   Company ever making a statement to the general public in

17   the 1970s in which they denied that cigarette smoking

18   with as addictive.  That's true, isn't it?

19       A    No.  That's not true.  I've seen responses to

20   consumers who wrote in to R. J. Reynolds denying that

21   their products were addictive.

22       Q    Okay.  Let's me follow-up on what you just

23   said.  You're talking about where some consumer looks up

24   R. J. Reynolds' address, writes a letter to the company,

25   right?

1       A    That's right.

2       Q    And then the company in response to that letter f

3   sends a letter back to whoever that consumer is, right?

4       A    Well, sometimes they do.  Sometimes there's

5   memos discussing how to respond as was the case in the

6   seventies that I'm thinking about.

7       Q    Okay.                                                                                                f

8       A    And then sometimes they refer those off to the

9   Tobacco Institute to respond to.  That shows the

10   relationship between the companies and the Tobacco

11   Institute.

12       Q    You told us earlier in the case that you got

13   this wonderful card catalog for all the documents,

14   right?

15       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

16       Q    You developed this indexing system where you

17   can go in and find basically a needle in the haystack,

18   if you know what you're looking for, in the documents,

19   right?

20            MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection, Your Honor.  That's

21       argumentative.

2 4                           MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.  Thank you.  I'll f

1       Q    You've got this indexing system where you can

2   go in and you can look for something specific, right?

3       A    Yes.  Constantly being updated and refined.

4       Q    Okay.  In the 80 million pages of documents

5   that you have at your disposal, indexed and cataloged,

6   did you find any evidence that John Price wrote a letter

7   to R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for any reason?

8       A    No.  I haven't looked for John Price.

9       Q    Well, you knew you were coming to testify in

10   this case about John Price, right?

11       A    Yes.

12       Q    Okay.  Have you ever seen, in the 80 million

13   pages of documents that you have at your disposal,

14   cataloged and indexed, any evidence that R. J. Reynolds

15   Tobacco Company sent a letter to John Price talking

16   about the health risks of cigarette smoking or whether

17   they're addictive?

18       A    I have not seen such a letter.  Because I

19   haven't looked.

20       Q    Okay.  So I want to set aside letters sent to

21   specific individuals, okay?  I'm asking now about a

22   statement made to the general public.  Is it true or

23   false that R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company never, as far

24   as you're aware, made a statement to the general public

25   in the 1970s where they denied that cigarette smoking

1   was addictive?  Is that true?

2       A    I'm not aware of � I think what you're

3   referring to, outside these consumer responses of

4   anything in the seventies.

5       Q    All right.  In 1985, the press coverage of the

6   health risks of cigarette smoking continues around the

7   country, right?

8       A    Correct.

9       Q    Including here in Florida in the 1980s.

10            MR. WALKER:  Can we have that, please?

11       Q    These are some examples from the Florida Times

12   Union, 10 commandments to prevent cancer, a stop smoking

13   class, Jacksonville Navy base to see new smoking rules

14   and so forth.  In this period in the 1980s you begin to

15   see more coverage, not just of the link between

16   cigarette smoking and illness, but articles talking

17   about classes or other things that people can do to quit

18   smoking, right?

19       A    Yes.  Not a whole lot but there were some.

2 0       Q    And the Great American Smoke-Out is an example

21   of a program that was put in place designed to get

22   people to put down cigarettes, right?

23       A    Right.  One day out of the year.  I think it

24   began in 1976.  And The Cancer Society would ask smokers

25   to try to quit for a day in order to try to stay smoke

1   free for the rest of their life.

2       Q    And then in 1985 the warnings on the packages

3   changed again, right?

4       A    That's right.

5       Q    The warnings on the packages changed again.

6       A    They did.

7            MR. WALKER:  Can you pull that up, please?

8       Q    And one of the warnings now from 1985 is

9   "Surgeon General's warning:  Quitting smoking now

10   greatly reduces serious risk to your health."

11             Right?

12       A    Correct.

13       Q    And that warning label about quitting smoking

14   now reducing risk to health, that's been there for the

15   last 30 years, right?

16       A    Correct.

17       Q    Another one of the warnings that was in

18   rotation starting in 1985 talks about how smoking causes

19   lung cancer, right?

20       A    Lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may

21   complicate pregnancy.

22       Q    All right.  We looked at some public service

23   announcements in other decades in the 1980.  I want to

24   follow-up.  You talked about how athletes were used to

25   advertise different products over the years, right?

1       A   Yes.

2       Q    Athletes were also used in the 1980s in public

3   service announcements trying to encourage people to quit

4   smoking, right?

5       A    Yes.

6       Q    Let's look at an example of that with Eric

7   Dickerson.

8             (A video clip was played and transcribed by the

9       court reporter to the best of her ability as

11             I'm Eric Dickerson.  I'm going to show you

12        something that can save your life.  Say these

13       footballs are your lungs.  Every time you smoke you

14        can damage your lungs with every puff.  Day after

15       day, year after year, your lungs get more and more

16       damaged until finally they may not breathe at all.

17       Your lungs could end up useless.  So don't smoke.

18       Keep your lungs full of clean, flesh air.  Take care

3
	A
	Yes.  Even to this day.

4
	Q
	Let's look at the one from 1987 on the same

5
	question
	we looked at for 1977.  Whether cigarette

6
	smoking
	is harmful to health from 1987 and this is the

7
	response
	of smokers.  87 percent, almost 9 out of 10

8
	smokers,
	in 1987 believed that cigarette smoking was

9
	harmful
	to health, right?

10
	A
	True .

11
	Q
	Not an awareness poll, a belief poll.

12
	A
	True .

13
	Q
	All right.  Let's move forward a few years to

14
	1990.
	

15
	
	MR. WALKER:  Do we have that?

16
	Q
	Similar question asked.  You're familiar with

17
	this one
	Do you think cigarette smoking is or is not

18
	harmful
	to your health?  That's a belief poll, right?

19
	A
	Correct.

20
	Q
	96 percent of Americans responded that

21
	cigarett
	es and cigarette smoking, I should say, is

22
	harmful
	to health; is that right?

23
	A
	That's right.  Although this doesn't include

24
	the separation for smokers versus non-smokers.
	
25
	Q
	When you say this doesn't include it, you're

1   probably talking about my slide.  But you know that the

2   poll simply didn't ask about smokers that year, right?

3       A    No.  They did.  I believe they did in 1990 so

4   you could separate out responses of smokers and

5   non-smokers.

6       Q    You think they separated out smokers in 1990?

7       A    I would have to go look at the Gallup polls.  I

8   may be wrong.  I thought they did in virtually every

9   year.

10       Q    You don't yet have them memorized, right?

11       A    There is a summary report by one of the Gallup

12   people and it summarizes their belief polls and how they

13   are used.

14       Q    Give me just a moment.

15            MR. WALKER:  May I have the Elmo, please?

16       Q    All right.  Gallup poll public opinion, 1990.

17   This is the one that we're both talking about.

18       A    Yes.  Right.  True.

19       Q    Okay.  And here's the question, "do you think

20   that cigarette smoking is or is not harmful to your

21   health?"

2 2                             Right?

2 3       A    That's right.

24       Q    And the figure is 96 percent, right?

25       A    Yeah.  I don't dispute the fact that you put up

1   the information from the slide.  But I think they can

2   break it out.

3       Q    Just a moment.  Typically you would see the

4   break out among smokers underneath there, right?

5       A    No.  You know, again, these are summaries and

6   so the answer would be no.  Sometimes you actually have

7   the poll and the Gallup makes the polls widely available

8   so you can sort the answers for smokers and non-smokers.

9       Q    Okay.  You don't have an idea in your mind of

10   what percentage of smokers you believe responded to a

11   poll saying that they thought that cigarette smoking was

12   harmful to health.

13       A    It would be the majority.  But it would be

14   lower for smokers than it is for the never smokers.

15   Because that's what you tend to find in these belief

16   polls.  And when you look at particularly heavy smokers,

17   a pack or more per day, you still see an even lower

18   percentage.  And some of their polls do break that out.

19   But not all of them.  But the raw data are there to go

20   back and break it out.

21            And my experience with Gallup polls is they

22   almost always are tracking smoking behavior so they have

23   the data to break it out.  But I don't have it

24   memorized.  I didn't do that analysis myself.

25       Q    Okay.  In any event, we looked at it in 1987

5   percent of smokers, right?

6       A    True.  Slightly different question but true.

7       Q    You have not been told or provided any

8   information about what John Price had to say about when

9   he first, according to him, believed that cigarette

13   written on this paper over here, you've got � this was

14   created � I guess this is Mr. Prysock's handwriting,

15   but it's got John Price at the top, right?

16       A    That's right.

17       Q    And then the only fact below it that's actually |

18   about John Price is when he was born, right?

19       A    Right.

2 0       Q    And then there's a document that's singled out

21       here from 1963?

2 2       A    That's right.

23       Q    And then there's this thing here about 1994 and |

3       Q    Okay.  I want you to assume that John Price

4   testified that he quit smokinq in 1993, okay?

5       A    Okay.

6       Q    That would mean that he quit smokinq before

7   those hearinqs in Waxman in 1994, riqht?

8       A    I would aqree that 1993 comes before 1994.

9       Q    You showed a clip of the Waxman hearinqs but it

10   was actually a much lonqer proceedinq, riqht?

11       A    Yeah.  It was all day.  I think the executives

12   qave prepared statements in the morninq and then

13   answered questions from the committee durinq the day on

14   a ranqe of topics.  Addiction was one we showed.  But

15   they also were asked questions about their positions of

1             (At the bench off the record.)

2   BY MR. WALKER:

3       Q    All right.  We were talking about the Waxman

4   hearings.  And I was going to ask you if one of the

5   prepared statements that you were referencing was one by

6   Jim Johnston, the then Chief Executive Officer of R. J.

7   Reynolds.

8       A    Correct.                                                                                          1

9       Q    And I don't believe you showed any portion of

10   his prepared statement in your direct examination, did

11   you?                                                                                                                      |

12       A    No.  Just his response to the question on

13   addiction.

14       Q    And that was the one where he gets cut off,

15   right?

16       A    That's right.  He said it doesn't need the

17   classic definition of addiction.

18       Q    Let's take a look at the portion of his

19   prepared remarks on this subject where he doesn't get 2 0        cut off.

21            MR. WALKER:  Will you play that, please?

Chief Executive Officer of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco

Company.

I think the sub committee should also be aware that Dr. Kessler's definition of addiction would classify most coffee, cola, and tea drinkers as addicts, caffeine addicts.  Many people experience a strong urge for a cup of coffee each morning.  And there is a well documented physical withdrawal syndrome associated with the consumption of coffee and caffeinated soft drinks.

Nonetheless, I seriously doubt that the American public would say that these characteristics put caffeine in the same class as addictive drugs such as cocaine and heroin.  During the past several years there have been a wide variety of attempts to convince the American public that cigarettes are addictive and that some public officials have even gone so far as to put cigarettes in the same class as cocaine and heroin.  You don't need to be a trained scientist to see this isn't true.  All you need to do is ask and honestly answer two simple questions:  First, would you rather board a plane with a pilot who just smoked a cigarette or one with a pilot who just had a couple of beers or snorted

1       cocaine or shot heroin or popped some pills; second,

2        if cigarettes were addictive, could almost 43

3       million Americans have quit smoking almost all of

4       them on their own without any outside help?

5             The answers are obvious and that is precisely

6       my point.  Cigarettes are clearly not in the same

7        class as addictive, mind altering drugs like heroin

8       and cocaine.  I agree that for some people cigarette

9       smoking is habit forming.  In the same way that

10       other pleasurable activities such as watching TV,

11       eating your favorite foods, sometimes overeating

12       your favorite foods, and drinking coffee can be

13       habit forming.  And, yes, some smokers find it

14       difficult to quit, but there is nothing about

15       cigarette smoking that prevents a person from

16       clearly thinking and making reasonable decisions

17        including the decision to quit.

18             (Videotape ends.)

2 0       Q    Dr. Cummings, the part that we just � part of

21   what Jim Johnston was pushing back on was the comparison |

22   of cigarette smoking to cocaine and heroin.  That was

23   part of what he was pushing back on, right, in that 2 4        clip.

25       A    Yes.  He's pushing back on whether cigarettes

2   substances.

3       Q    He never said that quitting smoking was easy,

4   did he?

5       A    No, he didn't say that.

6       Q    He never denied that quitting smoking could be

7   hard, did he?

8       A    No.  He said for some people it could be hard.

9       Q    In fact, you're not aware of any statement at

10   any time where someone from R. J. Reynolds Tobacco

11   Company denied that it could be hard to quit smoking.

12       A    Yes, I am.  The Tobacco Institute right after

13   the Surgeon General's Report publicly stated that the

14    '88 report had mischaracterized smoking as an addiction.

15   It was a scare tactic.  And they used some of the same

16   comparisons and analogies that Mr. Johnston did.

17       Q    That wasn't my question, Dr. Cummings.  My

18   question to you was, you're not aware of any statement

19   at any time where someone from R. J. Reynolds Tobacco 2 0       Company denied that it was hard to quit smoking, are

21   you?                                                                                                                      |

22       A    I think they denied that it was addictive, 2 3       which is the same thing.

2 4       Q    Dr. Cummings, that's not what I'm asking you,

25       okay?  I want you to try to answer my question as I've

	d it.  Are you not able to do that?

2
	A
	No.  I believe I answered the question and I

3
	would
	answer it the same way.  When they said it wasn't

	it's h

1       Q    Now, before we wrap up for the day, I want to

2   be sure about one thing.  You've not been given any

3   information about what quitting smoking was like for

4   John Price, have you?

5       A    As I've said many times today, I didn't review

6   any information about John Price other than his death

8   the brands he smoked.

10   these two documents.  I get it.  I'm asking you a little

11   bit broader than that.  Not just what you reviewed.  I

12   know this is what you reviewed.  You haven't even been

13   told any information about Mr. Price's testimony about

14   what his quitting experience was, have you?

15            MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection, Your Honor.  And we

16       may need side bar on this because I believe the door

17       has now been opened based upon this questioning.

and they said, okay, we won't have Dr. Cummings talk

about Mr. Price's addiction.  However, I said, now,

but one thing, though, they can't then ask him, you

don't have any opinions about whether Mr. Price was

addicted.  And the Court specifically said, yeah,

that would be improper.  They're blocking them.  So

to now go into and ask, you don't know anything

about whether he was addicted or not, you don't have

any facts about that �

MR. MITNIK:  We weren't told �

THE COURT:  I don't need two people.

MR. WALKER:  If I might, two points.  One, Dr. Cummings was disclosed as a generic witness with no addiction opinion about Mr. Price long before we filed any motion.  This repeated assertion that they pulled something back in response to a motion is simply false.

Second, the question that Mr. Prysock said he objected to is not a question that I asked.  I've not asked him anything about addiction.

THE COURT:  No.  But it would be implication as they tried to hide something from Dr. Cummings.  I know that may not be your intention but that's the implication that since he doesn't know anything

MR. WALKER:  Your Honor �

THE COURT:  Here's the �

MR. WALKER:  I haven't finished my line of questioning.  They're anticipating me going some place I'm not even going.

THE COURT:  If the objection to this � every time when you ask him again about John Price and what he knows and doesn't know about John Price, is asked and answered.  I will sustain that objection. I'll sustain it every time from here on through that I can think of if that type of question is asked because that's what was established � you established it very well at the very beginning other than those � if you have something from his death certificate, from that summary of something having to do with Interrogatories and that small summary of something having to do with depositions.  That's what I'm recalling.

But an asked and answered objection would be sustained.

MR. WALKER:  Very well, Your Honor.  I understand.

1             (Bench conference concluded.)

2   BY MR. WALKER:

3       Q    Okay.  Dr. Cummings, let's go back to the piece

4   of papers of what you were told for this case.  Whether

5   it's from something you were told, whether it's from

6   these two paragraphs you were given about Mr. Price, or

7   whether it's from this death certificate, you have no

8   basis to know whether John Price's experience quitting

9   is anything like what people experience when they're

10   trying to get off cocaine or heroin, do you?

11       A    I certainly do in terms of knowing � I think

12   I've been told that he was a heavy smoker to a long

13   duration and I've worked with many people like that and

14   I certainly understand the basis for the conclusion as

15   to why nicotine is as addictive as heroin and cocaine.

16   They're talking about the behavioral effects in terms of

17   relapse and also the effects in the brand.

18       Q    Dr. Cummings, I know it's getting late in the

19   day.  That's not the question I asked you.  The question

20   I asked you relates to quitting.  Just quitting.  Okay?

21       A    Okay.

22       Q    There's nothing in this two paragraph document

23   that they gave you or this death certificate �

24            MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection, Your Honor.  Asked and

25       answered.

1            MR. WALKER:  It wasn't answered, Your Honor.

2             THE COURT:  You haven't asked the question yet.

3            MR. WALKER:  It really wasn't answered.

4       Q    All right.  You know what I'm going to ask you

5   but I'll do it again.  This two-page document you got

6   from plaintiff's counsel, this death certificate,

7   there's no information in these two documents that would

8   give you a basis to compare John Price's experience

9   quitting with the experience a heroin addict or a

10   cocaine addict would have getting off those substances.

11       A    And I answered no.  There is that information

12   in the interrogatory that talked about him being a heavy

13   long term smoker for 59 years, I believe.

14       Q    In the interrogatory.

15       A    Yes.

16            MR. WALKER:  Can I have the Elmo, please?

17       Q    All right.

18       A    Period of 59 years.  That's what I was

19   referring to.

20       Q    We're going to come to that.  So my question

21   was whether or not there was something in the record

22   that would allow you to compare John Price's experience

23   quitting with the experience of a heroin or cocaine

24   addict quitting and you said this document.  Let's look 2 5        at it.

12
	Q    If John Price's testimony is that he quit

13
	smoking in 1993, and you accepted this information about

14
	him having been a smoker for 59 years, would you tell

15
	the jury at what age Mr. Price started smoking based on

16
	that?

	A    I would have to go back and look at his death

	MR. WALKER:  Can you all see it?

5

6
	THE COURT:  Mr. Walker, please angle it so I

8
	MR. WALKER:  Of course, Your Honor.

	THE COURT:  Thank you.  Just angle it just a

10
	little.  That's good.  I can see it.

11
	MR. WALKER:  All right.

12
	Q    Let's try this again.  It really is the end of

13
	the day.  1993.  I've asked you to assume that his

14
	testimony will be that he quit in this year.

5   these days but 3, treat like that 13, minus 9, you get a

6   4, right?

7       A    Right.

8       Q    Good so far.  All right.  Then I'm going to do

9   it old school.  The 9 becomes an 8.

10       A    Right.

11       Q    Right?  Okay.  I know some of this has changed.

12   Or that's what I keep hearing from my kids.  8 minus 5

13   is 3, right?

14       A    Right.

15       Q    I'm blocking.  I'm trying not to block.  And

16   then we just carry down the 1 and the 9, right?

17       A    Correct.

18       Q    Okay.  Now, here's my question.  Is it even

19   possible based on the information you have that Mr.

20   Price could have started smoking in 1934?

21       A    No.                                                                                                     |

MR. WALKER:  I have no further questions for today.

THE COURT:  Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to tell you this.  Dr. Cummings will not be here tomorrow.  But he is not finished testifying.  There will be more testimony from Dr. Cummings later.  But we're trying to accommodate his schedule and other people's schedules.  So it'll just be taking � there will be more cross-examination.  There will be some redirect examination later on.  In any event, I just wanted to let you know that.  I would like for you to � who's your next witness?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Dr. David Burns, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Okay.  I would like for you to be here tomorrow morning at about the same time you were today.  I would like to try to start right at 8:30 in the morning.  And remember, don't discuss this case with anyone, not even among yourselves. You're excused.

THE COURT:  Is there anything that y'all can think of that you're going to want me to rule on in the morning for some reason?

6       said those are not going to be admitted in this case

7       and they're on their disclosure.

8            MR. PRYSOCK:  I think the ruling was a little

9       bit different than that.  It's just that if the door f

10       is open or if a foundation is laid, we have listed

11       them �

12             THE COURT:  Did I sign an order?

13            MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.

14             THE COURT:  It will be easy enough for me to

15       read the order.

16            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

17             THE COURT:  I'll just look at the order.

18            MR. WALKER:  May I read it into the record,

19       Your Honor?  Defendant's motion is granted as to the

20       2010, 2012, and 2014 Surgeon General reports.

21       Unless defendant takes a position of such that they

22        can be used for purposes of cross-examination with

opening the door, it means that would include

THE COURT:  We aren't going to do it tomorrow. If that's my order, just follow my order.  It will be simple enough.

MR. MITNIK:  Okay.

MR. WALKER:  Thank you, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Thank you.

MR. PRYSOCK:  They're not going to bring anybody so if they open the door with them �

MR. MITNIK: I have no intent to do it on direct. If I believe they've opened the door, redirect to me is akin to your ruling �

THE COURT:  He's talking about having something that I rule on in the morning which would mean that it would be something that you intend to put on during the direct examination sometime tomorrow.  If I have ruled that way, follow my order.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

MR. MITNIK:  I will not do anything without approaching the bench and it would be on redirect only.

	Q    I want to continue to follow-up on the

	testimony you gave, I guess it was Monday?

23
	A    It was Monday.

1   testimony that you gave about the 1953, 1954 time frame.

2       A    Okay.

3       Q    In particular, the events leading up to and

4    just beyond the meeting that you described at the Plaza

5   Hotel.

6            MR. WALKER:  Can I have the Elmo, please?

7       Q    First, I want to see if we can clear something

8   up.  You showed the jury a memo that was written by

9   Claude Teague in 1953.  Do you remember that?

10       A    That was a report.

11       Q    You showed his report.  That was the one where

12   you showed the bibliography at the back where Claude

13   Teague had gone to the library and cited various journal

14   articles and so forth that he referenced in the memo

15   about smoking and health, right?

16       A    Correct.  78 citations, I believe.

17       Q    78 citations.  Not one of them were any

18   original research that Claude Teague had done.

19       A    That's correct.  It was a review of the

20   scientific literature.

21       Q    And not just Claude Teague, as you say, he

22   wasn't relying on � we relied on for his report, right?

23       A    That's correct.

24       Q    Now, here's the thing.  You told the jury, I

25   wrote it down, in your direct examination that in 1953

1   when Dr. league wrote this report, you said that he was

2   the head of the chemistry unit at the time.  Do you

3   remember saying that?

4       A    I don't recall saying that.  He was hired, I

5   think he said he was a chemist and I've seen the

6   organizational charts.  I think it was a relatively

7   small R&D program at that point and he was, like, third

8   in line in that program at that time in history.

9       Q    He was very what?

10       A    He was about third in line in that Research and

11   Development program at that time.

12       Q    Well, let's be clear.  So regardless of what I

13   thought you said, you agree with me that Dr. league in

14   1953, when he wrote that memo, was not the head of the

15   chemistry unit at R. J. Reynolds.

16       A    I don't think they had a chemistry unit at that

17   time.  He was hired as a chemist because they were

18   developing that element of their program.  And later �

19   because there are organizational charts I've seen, he

20   certainly rose up the ranks and was one of the senior

21   executives in charge of Research and Development at

22   Reynolds, among other positions that he had.

23       Q    You mentioned about him rising up the ranks.

24   You're familiar with Claude league's resume'.

25       A    Sure.

	Q
	Among the documents that you reviewed and

2
	indexed,
	right?

3
	A
	That's right.

4
	Q
	Let's take a look at that.  Do you see that

5
	this is
	the internal resume' from R. J. Reynolds of

6
	Claude T
	eague?

7
	A
	That's right.

8
	Q
	And I want to turn to the second page

9
	indicating his work experience.  Okay.  And you see that
	
10
	the firs
	t work experience he has indicating when he

11
	started
	at R. J. Reynolds was in 1951, right?

12
	A
	That's right.

13
	Q
	And his position at that time was research

14
	chemist,
	right?

15
	A
	That's right.

16
	Q
	And that was his position from 1951 all the way l

17
	until 1960, right?
	
18
	A
	That's right.

19
	Q
	Research chemist.

20
	A
	That's right.

21
	Q
	Okay.                                            i

22
	A
	There are organizational charts in other

23
	document
	s that I've seen that indicate who reported to

24
	him, for
	example, Dr. Rodgman reported to him.

	In 1953 that would then have been two years

1   after Mr. Teague was hired at R. J. Reynolds, right?

2       A    That's correct.

3       Q    And he was in his twenties at the time he wrote

4   the memo that you talked about?

5       A    Yes.

6       Q    By the way, this was the memo that you say

7   shows that at least R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company knew

8   in 1953 that cigarette smoking caused cancer; is that

9   your position?

10       A    No.  It's my position that the memo speaks for

11   the � or the report speaks for itself that one of the

12   conclusions in the report is that the human clinical

13   studies that had been done up to that point had

14   implicated heavy smoking as a cause of primary cancer of

15   the lung and that the animal studies that had been done

16   while they were inconclusive generally were consistent

17   with the finding that cigarette smoking or the tar

18   extracted from cigarettes would cause tumors in the

19   animals and that the chemistry that was evolving at that

20   time in history up to 1953 had suggested there were

21   likely carcinogens in tobacco smoke and he commented on

22   one investigator having identified benzopyrene so that's

23   what the findings and his conclusions stated.

24       Q    All of those conclusions, all of those

25   findings, all of those comments, those were the

1   comments, were findings and conclusions of an entry

2   level research chemist who was in his twenties when he

3   wrote it; is that right?

4       A    Well, you can describe him as an entry level.

5   He wasn't a relatively new employee, he was two years

6   in.  He was a Ph.D. chemist.  And that report, as I had

7   indicated, was shared with the law department in, I

8   think, Mr. Henry Ram, chief general counsel of R. J.

9   Reynolds.

10       Q    Talking about who you said it was shared with,

11   I'm interested in the author of the report.

12       A    Sure.

13       Q    And you've agreed with me he was in his

14   twenties, he was a relatively new chemist.  This was his

15   second job in life, wasn't it?

16       A    After the military he had one other position

17   and then � yes, it was his second job, the job that he

18   stayed with for his professional career.

19       Q    At the time that he wrote this memo in 1953,

20   Claude Teague had no experience in cancer research.

21       A    That's true.

22       Q    All right.  And let's be clear about one thing

23   before I move away from Claude Teague, in 1953, that

24   when he wrote that memo that you're relying on, he most

25   certainly was not running R. J. Reynolds Tobacco

1   Company, was he?

2       A    No.  He wasn't running the company.  There

3   were, I think Ed Darr was the President, Henry Ram was

4   the chief general counsel.  They were the ones running

5   the company.

6       Q    The President of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

7   was Ed Darr, right?

8       A    That's right.

9       Q    Claude Teague would never go on to become

10   President of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.

11       A    That's true.

12       Q    All right.  Let's take a look at the Frank

13   Statement that you showed the jury.  This is it, right?

14       A    Yes, it is.

15       Q    At the bottom of the Frank Statement there are

16   � it says sponsors.  These are basically the people who

17   signed the Frank Statement, right?

18       A    Correct.

19       Q    And this was the full page ad that you talked

20   about that ran after the meeting at the Plaza Hotel.

21       A    Yes.  January 4, I believe.

22       Q    And so the person who actually signed this

23   document on behalf of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company was

24   not Claude Teague, but it was Ed Darr that you

25   mentioned, right?

1       A    That's right.

2       Q    And another important figure leading to this

3   full page ad that ran, of course, was Paul Hahn, right?

4       A    That's right.

5       Q    And he wasn't some research chemist at the

6   American Tobacco Company, he was the President, right?

7       A    Correct.                                                                                          |

8       Q    Okay.  Now, you've seen documents describing

9   what the Presidents of these companies were reported to

10   have believed about the issues addressed in the Frank

11   Statement, right?

12       A    Yeah.  The minutes, I believe, from the meeting |

13   on December 14 at the Plaza Hotel and also on the 15th,

14   I think, the original minutes were from the tobacco

15   companies, then they agreed to hire Hill & Knowlton and

16   I believe there's some minutes from the 15th from John

17   Hill and his associates when they met with the

18   executives from the public relations firm.

19       Q    And those are minutes that you didn't show the

20   jury in your direct examination, did you?

21       A    I did not.

2 2       Q    Okay.                                                                                                f

2 3       A    I don't have any problems with showing them.

24       Q    Even before the meeting at the Plaza Hotel,

25   you're aware of the telegram that Paul Hahn, that we

1   just looked at, sent calling them together, the

2   Presidents, for this meeting, right?

3       A    Yes.  December 10.

4       Q    All right.  Now, this is the December 10

5   telegram you were just talking about, right?

6       A    That's right.

7       Q    This is before the meeting at the Plaza Hotel,

8   before the January Frank Statement, right?

9       A    That's right.

10       Q    And this, this telegram, this is another one of |

11   those documents that you were describing that were

12   previously secret that didn't become public until

13   sometime in the 1990s; is that right?

14       A    True.  Although I mentioned that the meetings

15   at the Plaza Hotel had gotten some press coverage.  That

16   was in early January.

17       Q    I'm just talking about this specific document.

18       A    Sure.                                                                                                f

19       Q    This is one of those secret, internal documents 2 0       you were talking about that didn't become public until

21   sometime in the nineties.

22       A    I'm not sure about this particular document.

23   But certainly the minutes, and there were the meetings

24   on the 14th, the 15th, the 24th, 26th, the 28th of

25   December all leading up to the culmination of �

1       Q    So this is the telegram from Paul Hahn �

2       A    Right.

3       Q    � President of American Tobacco that would

4   later sign the Frank Statement, right?

5       A    That's right.

6       Q    Let's see how he describes the purpose of the

7   meeting and the charges that have been made against

8   smoking.

9       A    Okay.                                                                                                |

10       Q    "In view of the highly publicized claims of

11   certain medical men not sponsored by any duly accredited |

12   scientific medical organization charging serious danger

13   to health from smoking, I suggest for your consideration |

14   a meeting of the heads of all those cigarette companies

15   that have manifested active interest in scientific

16   research and are therefore informed as to the true

17   facts."

18             Did I read that right?

19       A    You did.

20       Q    And this is the telegram that Paul Hahn is

21   sending to Ed Darr and others, right?

22       A    Yes.  The heads of the other cigarette

23   companies.  I think they're all named at the bottom.

24       Q    This wasn't a press release. 2 5       A    No.  It was a telegram.

Veritext Reporting Company 212-2 7 9-9424                        www.veritext.com                        212-490-3 430

1       Q    This wasn't a statement that was intended to be

2   communicated to the public.

3       A    As far as I know, it was not.

4       Q    Okay.  And Paul Hahn is describing the charges

5   of "serious danger to health as being made by certain

6   medical men not sponsored by any duly accredited

7   scientific medical organization."

8             Do you see that?

9       A    Yes.

10       Q    And then this same non-public document from

11   Paul Hahn he's talking about calling together the heads

12   of the cigarette companies who have manifested an active

13   interest in scientific research and are informed as to

14   the true facts, right?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    And then he says:  "The objective of this

17   meeting at the Plaza Hotel would be an industry response

18   to these charges exposing their lack of scientific

19   foundation."

20             Do you see that?

21       A    I do.

22       Q    There's no place in this document where Paul

23   Hahn in calling this meeting says, the cat's out of the

24   bag, the public has learned that cigarette smoking is

25   harmful and we need to come together and hatch a

1   conspiracy to trick the public?

2       A    No.  Not in this telegram.

3       Q    This telegram suggests that Paul Hahn believed

4   that the charges of serious danger to health from

5   smoking lacked a scientific foundation.  Right?

6       A    That's what he says.  Said � actually what he

7   says, "the objective would be an industry response to

8   these charges exposing their lack of scientific

9   foundation.  The method would be such as the meeting

10   might determine including use of advertising media."

11       Q    That's the how, right?  The method is talking

12   about how.  But the objective is to expose what Paul

13   Hahn wrote, at least, were charges that lacked a

14   scientific foundation, right?

15       A    Well, that was � I mean, the telegram speaks

16   for itself.

17       Q    You haven't showed the jury any document that

18   suggests that Paul Hahn didn't truly believe that these

19   charges lacked a scientific foundation, have you?

20            MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection, Your Honor.  May we

21       approach briefly.

22             THE COURT:  Really?

2 3                           MR.   PRYSOCK:      Just   very  briefly.

2       before?

3            MR. PRYSOCK:  That would be a good idea.

4             THE COURT:  Just remind me.  I may forget.

5            MR. MITNIK:  I may, too.  But I'll try.  Judge, |

6       I was whispering the objection.  As I understand �

7       what � remember when I was up with Dr. Burns and I

8       was pointing out what they hadn't pointed out?

9             THE COURT:  Yes.

10            MR. MITNIK:  You said you can ask questions but

11       not � this is now being about the same pattern of

12       they didn't show �

13             THE COURT:  Neither side.  But � and I

14       understand that objection.  I heard that.  I heard

15       that earlier whether you went to the � there was

16       some reference to a document that had not been shown |

17       to the jury.  However, I don't mind if you preface

18       it with something like, okay, I've got another

19       document, this isn't a document that we've already

20        seen, so the people know this isn't a document that

21       we've already seen.

22             Now, if in the questioning it becomes one of

23       those things and you didn't tell the jury this, you

24       didn't tell the jury that, like they were doing

25       yesterday that I stopped, I don't want that either.

2            MR. WALKER:  May I ask a question?

3             THE COURT:  Okay.

4            MR. WALKER:  I thought what you said was, Mr.

5       Walker said this, now please respond to it.  I think

6       I'm entitled to call the jury's attention to the

7        selection bias of what Dr. Cummings has decided to

8        show, I thought.

9             THE COURT:  No, no, no.  I don't have a problem f

10       with you pointing out that this is not a document

11       that they had � that the jury's already seen

12       presented by Mr. Cummings.  I have no problem with

13       that.                                                                                                           |

14            MR. WALKER:  Okay.

15             THE COURT:  I do have a problem if we ever

16       start trying the lawyers.

17            MR. WALKER:  That's why I didn't say anything

18       about the lawyers.

19             THE COURT:  And he says �

20            MR. MITNIK:  He would show this one that

21       implicates us.  That's different than what you said

22       he can do.  I don't quarrel with what you said.

2 3                           THE COURT:  I don't quarrel with him saying

2 4                this is not a document that you've shown the jury.

MR. MITNIK:  We didn't object to that.

THE COURT:  Good.

MR. MITNIK:  The thing that they were preventing us from doing whenever we went to explain the meaning of a document,, they objected, they're spending all this time, isn't that what they meant?

THE COURT:  Well, now, they get to cross-examine.  You don't get to cross-examine on direct.

MR. MITNIK:  I understand.  But you're still asking him to interpret the meaning of a document.

MR. PRYSOCK:  They filed a Motion in Limine preventing us from having the witness talk about the meaning and intent of documents and the Court granted those.

THE COURT:  So what has come up, that's a problem?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Did he mean this or did he say this, I'm just saying, we'll object if it comes up.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Good, thank you.

MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, may I say one thing before � I know we have realtime transcripts and over and over during this trial I have been accused of saying things that the realtime shows I didn't say.

1             THE COURT:  And let me ask you a question.  I

2       think over and over in this trial I have over and

3       over said I haven't seen anything bad or untoward by

4       the lawyers.

5            MR. WALKER:  I didn't mean to go there, Your

6       Honor.  I'm just suggesting that we have realtime

7       transcripts.  I don't think assertion should be made

8       about what questions were asked or not asked without

9       a good faith basis in the realtime transcript that

10       we have.  So I would just �

11            MR. MITNIK:  I can assure Your Honor I don't

12       ever say anything without a good faith basis.

14   BY MR. WALKER:

15       Q    Okay.  Dr. Cummings, picking up where we were,

16   I want to be clear, this document that we're looking at

17   is not a document that we saw during your direct

18   examination; is that right?

19       A    I'm not sure whether we did or not.  I think I

20   mentioned there had been a telegram.

21       Q    Okay.  I can't remember if you answered my last

22   question.  Do you have a document from Paul Hahn where

23   he's describing the charge against smoking as something

24   other than a charge lacking scientific foundation?

25       A    We have the telegram and, you know, it says

1
	what it says.

2
	Q    Okay.  Let's look at one of the memos you were

3
	just describing.  During your direct examination we saw

4
	a document from one of the other meetings involving

5
	research directors, right?

6
	A    The forwarding memo.

7
	Q    The forwarding memo.

8
	A    Right.

9
	Q    And in that document there were some statements

10
	in quotes, boy, wouldn't it be great if we could do

11
	this, I forget what they all were.

12
	A    They were �                                     1

13
	Q    I'm not asking you �

14
	A    � excerpts of the Medical Directors.

15
	Q    Okay.  And those statements that were reported

16
	there, it didn't say who said what, did it?

17
	A    No, it did not.

18
	Q    But in any event we know that whoever said

19
	those things, they were not the Presidents of the

20
	companies, right?

21
	A    No.  They are actually talking about the heads

22
	of the research � R&D programs for four of the

23
	companies.  That's actually referenced in one of the

24
	minutes, I think the December 15th minutes, where Mr.

25
	Hill, or whoever wrote those notes, is commenting on the

1   fact that Hill & Knowlton had interviewed three of the

2   heads of the R&D programs for each of the companies and

3   was scheduled that afternoon, so on December 15 to

4   interview the fourth person.

5            And then we have the forwarding memo that is

6   describing the responses from those interviews that were

7   conducted.

8       Q    You said whoever it was that wrote that memo.

9       A    Yeah.

10       Q    Is there some uncertainty about the author of

11   the memo?

12       A    No.  It's from Hill & Knowlton.

13       Q    I'm talking about a person.  What human being

14   wrote that memo?

15       A    I would have to go look at the note to indicate

16   which executive at Hill & Knowlton.

17       Q    Okay.  So some unnamed executive at Hill &

18   Knowlton �

19       A    I could, if I saw the initials on the memo, if

20   you want to show it to me � it would just refresh my

21   memory.  It was in the archives of John Hill at the

22   University of Wisconsin where I got the John Hill papers

23   that include all this information.

24       Q    You talked about that on direct.

25       A    Sure.

1       Q    So that memo that we saw in your direct

2   examination was not reporting the beliefs of the people

3   who signed the Frank Statement; is that right, Paul Hahn |

4   and Ed Darr?

5       A    No.  It was the medical directors from the �

6   or not the medical directors, the research and � R&D

7   directors for each of the companies.

8       Q    So let's talk about one of the other documents

9   from those meetings that you know about because you told f

10   us about it.  This is the one from December 15, 1953.

11       A    That's right.

12       Q    Background material on the cigarette industry

13   client, right?

14       A    Right.

15       Q    And this particular document is a document that

16   we did not see during your direct examination; is that

17   right?

18       A    That's right.  I described the fact that they

19   had these meetings and there were minutes and in fact I

2 0        just did a moment ago and this is one of the minutes.  I

21   think it's Mr. Thompson who wrote these minutes.

22       Q    "The following information was given us by the

23   Presidents of the leading tobacco companies at the hotel

24   plaza this morning."

2 5                            Do you see that?

1       A    Right.  Yes.

2       Q    And then down here it says:  "The group was

3   called together by Mr. Paul Harm, President of the

4   American Tobacco Company."

5            Right?

6       A    That's right.

7       Q    And then it goes on to talk about the Chief

8   Executive Officers and it lists these companies, right?

9       A    That's right.  Points out Liggett and Myers did

10   not participate.

11       Q    And in this document from the meeting with the

12   Presidents it says:  "The industry is strongly convinced

13   that there is no sound scientific basis for the charges

14   that have been made."

15            Do you see that?

16       A    I do.

17       Q    "They believe" � and when it says they, that's

18   referring back to the Presidents, right?

19       A    That's right.

20            MR. PRYSOCK:  You know, I apologize, Mr.

21       Walker.  Objection.  This is contrary to the Engle

22        findings.  This line of questioning that's

23       attempting to be done here. 2 4                            THE COURT: Overruled. 2 5       BY MR. WALKER:

1       Q    "They believe that the more sensational

2   acquisitions in the recent papers were premature and in

3   some cases represent publicity issued in the hopes of

4   attracting funds and support for further research."

5            Did I read that right?

6       A    You did.

7       Q    And that is consistent with the document that

8   we just saw from Paul Hahn talking about the charges

9   having a lack of scientific foundation, right?

10       A    Sure.

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  And we have a � I haven't gotten

21   Presidents of the tobacco companies believed about

22   whether there was a sound scientific basis for the

23   charges that were made during this time period? 2 4       A    Yes, he have.

	First of all, let's be clear, this is July 30,

2
	1957.
	

3
	A
	That's right.

	Q
	Just shortly after the Frank Statement, right?

	A number of years just before they created the

1   done in counteracting unverified, unjustified, and

2   unsubstantiated claims of the anti-cigarette fanatics."

3            Do you see that?

5       Q    That language there is consistent with the

6   language we just saw in the internal memorandum from

7   December 15 saying that the Presidents of the companies

8   were strongly convinced there was no sound scientific

9   basis for the charges that were made, true?

10       A    That's right.  That was a consistent public

11   position by R. J. Reynolds and the other conspirators

12   for 45 years.

13       Q    Well, this document was not a public document.

14   This wasn't sent to the general public, was it?

15       A    No, it was not.

16       Q    This one a private communication from one

17   President, in this case, R. J. Reynolds, to another

18   President, Paul Hahn, that was not meant for public

19   consumption, right?

2 0       A    That's true.

21       Q    Is this one of those secret, internal documents

22   that didn't come to light until the 1990s?

2 3       A    It was.                                                                                            1

1   Reynolds at the time is privately talking about the

2   unverified, unjustified and unsubstantiated claims of

3   the anti-cigarette fanatics, right?

4       A    Yes.  He called the TIRC a successful defense

5   of operation.

6       Q    The document does not say that we have done a

7   very fine job of obscuring what we all know, which is

8   that cigarette smoking causes cancer and death.  It

9   doesn't say that, right?

10       A    No.  It says what it says.

11        Q    And we certainly haven't seen in this case any

12   document where Ed Darr, the President of Reynolds, who

13   signed the Frank Statement, indicates that he believed

14   that the charges against cigarette smoking were

15   verified, justified or substantiated in this time

16   period.

17       A    No.  All public statements from Ed Darr were

18   that -- hadn't been proving that cigarette smoking

19   caused any human disease.  That was the consistent

20   position of R. J. Reynolds, you know, up until 2000.

21        Q    That position, that public position that you

22    just described of Ed Darr, is consistent with this

23   position that's being expressed privately to Paul Hahn,

24   true?

25       A    Well, I don't dispute the fact that the �

1   those words are used in this letter to Paul Hahn

2   communicating the success of TIRC and what he states, so

3   I don't dispute the fact that he says a very fine job

4   has been done in counteracting unverified, unjustified,

5   unsubstantiated claims of the anti-cigarette fanatics.

6   In other words, TIRC has been a successful defense of

7   operation.

8       Q    Right.  Let's go to the next paragraph:  "It

9   now appears, however, that the tobacco industry should

10   go on the offensive in bringing the truth about

11   cigarette smoking to the public.  The only way to

12   destroy a lie is to correct it with the truth and

13   certainly we have plenty of material to use to

14   accomplish this."

15            Do you see that?

16       A    Yes.

17       Q    All right.  He's not saying we should go lie to

18   the public and obscure the truth.  That is not found

19   anywhere in this document, is it?

20       A    No.  When he talks about the creation of a

21   public relations organization, he didn't name it, the

22   Tobacco Institute, but that's created a few months later

23   after this letter.

24       Q    What the President of R. J. Reynolds is talking

25   about is bringing the truth from his point of view to

1   the cigarette � about cigarette smoking to the public

2   and to correct what Ed Darr is describing as a lie with

3   the truth from his point of view about that, right?

4       A    That's what he says.

5       Q    Now, before I move on to another subject, I

6   want to see if you can answer the following question yes

7   or no.  You admit that you have a significant bias

8   against the tobacco companies, correct?

9       A    What I have said is I have an acquired bias

10   based on what I have learned from my research �

11       Q    Dr. Cummings �

12       A    � my experience working with smokers and, yes,

13   I think your client has acted in a reckless and

14   irregardless way.

15       Q    I'm sorry.  If you can answer this question

16   with a yes or no.  If you can't, tell me you can't.  You

17   admit that you have a significant bias against the

18   tobacco companies, correct?

19       A    Yes.  Given the �

20            MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection.  Asked and answered.

21             THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Given the explanation I

22        just gave. 2 3       BY MR. WALKER:

24       Q    When you testify as you are today, you want the

25   plaintiff in the case to win, right?

1       A    I believe it's justified based on my research,

2   experience, and training in the field.

3       Q    Your answer is yes, when you testify, you want

4   the plaintiff in the case to win, right?

5       A    Yes.  I believe it's justified.

6       Q    In fact, you have agreed that in cases like

7   this, when you testify, you're rooting for the plaintiff

8   to win.

9       A    When I have been asked that question, yes.

10       Q    And in this case, you are rooting for the

11   plaintiff in this case to win, right?

12       A    I'm rooting for justice.

13       Q    Are you rooting for the plaintiff in this case

14   to win, or not?

15       A    I believe that would be justice.

16       Q    In the past five years alone, you have made a

17   little more than 1.2 million dollars testifying for the

18   plaintiffs you want to win, right?

19       A    I've never been asked by defendants but, yes, I 2 0       have earned that amount of money.

21       Q    And you've said in the past that testifying for

22   pay against cigarette companies has become almost a

23   second job for you.

24       A    I don't think I ever said for pay, but I have

25   commented, when I was asked, it was like a second job

1   because it has been a time � a large time commitment

2   for me, particularly in the last five years.

3       Q    Well, you seem to be quibbling with the part

4   where I said for pay.  Isn't it true that your work with |

5   plaintiff's lawyers provided a majority of your income

6   from all sources in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014?

7       A    I have said that in those years, that's true.

8   I've been testifying since 1996, however, and many of

9   those cases I did pro bono thinking this would be done.

10       Q    Since the beginning of 2010 alone, you've

11   testified live in 90 other trials to 90 other juries,

12   right?

13       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

14       Q    And none of those were pro bono.

15       A    No.                                                                                                     |

16       Q    Let's pull up a demonstrative that we put

17   together that I want to ask you about.  We put together

18   just your testimony from January 2013 to August 2016.

19   We've listed your testimony whether it was in trial or 2 0       given in a deposition.  The jury's heard about what

21       depositions are.

2 2       A    Sure.                                                                                                f

23       Q    And you can see this information that you spent

24   191 days, that's about six months, during that period if f

25   you put it all together �

2
	Q    � testifying for plaintiffs suing tobacco

4
	A    Right.  This includes weekends because

5
	depositions are � typically I try to schedule on

6
	weekends as well as evening hours so it doesn't

7
	interfere with my day job.

9
	talked about and the jury has heard about.

10
	A    Okay.                                           ;

19
	A    All right.

20
	Q    You started off or at some point in your

21
	presentation you showed this document from 1928, right?

22
	A    That's correct.

23
	Q    And you know from the information that you have

24
	provided, that is about eight years, yeah, about eight

25
	years before Mr. Price was born, right?

	A
	That's right.

2
	Q
	This document that I'm showing here is another

3
	document
	we saw during your direct examination, right?

4
	A
	That's right.

5
	Q
	And this one's from 1927.  That one would be

6
	about nine years before Mr. Price was even born, right?
	
7
	A
	That's right.

8
	Q
	Now, you told me when we started on whatever

9
	day it was, I guess it was Monday �
	
10
	A
	No.  It was Friday, actually.

11
	Q
	Friday.  Okay.  Thank you.  You told me that

12
	you knew
	when you came to testify you were testifying in

13
	a case about John Price, right?
	
14
	A
	Yes.                                             1

15
	Q
	And you were provided the information about

16
	what Joh]
	i Price's birthday was, right?

17
	A
	I received his death certificate so date of

18
	birth an<
	i date of death.

19
	Q
	Okay.  These documents that you showed in your

20
	presentation you knew predated Mr. Price's birth, right?
	
21
	A
	Yes, I did.

22
	Q
	You show these documents almost every time you

23
	testify,
	right?

24
	A
	I do.

1   right?

2       A    Yes.  Usually I'm talking about the information f

3   environment and the actions of the defendants, in this

4   case, R. J. Reynolds, and so I think they're relevant to |

5   describe the actions of R. J. Reynolds.

6       Q    You told the jury that you started off, you had j

7   access to 16 million pages of documents, right?

8       A    8.                                                                                                       |

9       Q    You started off, I thought about 16 million and f

10   then you said you �

11       A    Oh, I started with 16, I'm sorry.

12       Q    Started with 16, that's all right, and then at

13   some point it got up to 40 million, right?

14       A    Yeah.  Well, 16 million hard copies arrived on

15   my doorstep that I digitized.  There were approximately

16   30 million at the time when we started that went up on

17   two websites for each of the companies and we used � I

18   had some very good IT people who spidered off those

19   documents so we could create a common searching

20   mechanism, the index, as you will, and that created

21   about 40 million pages and over time it's now up to 80

22   million pages of material.

23       Q    So before you took the stand in this case, you

24   told me it was Friday, I'm still working through it �

1   answering questions.

2       Q    Now it's coming together.  I got it.

3       A    Sorry.

4       Q    That's okay.  Before you took the stand on

5   Friday, you had at your disposal an indexed set of 80

6   million pages of documents, right?

7       A    That's true.

8       Q    And during your direct examination, we did not

9   see a single document from Mr. Price's lifetime where a

10   tobacco company was saying, was talking about going to

11   prep schools, colleges, universities or summer schools;

12   is that true?

13       A    That would be untrue.

14       Q    You believe that you showed a document from Mr.

15   Price's lifetime talking about going on to high schools,

16   prep schools, colleges during his lifetime?

17       A    Yeah.  They surveyed high school and junior

18   high school students, college students.  I think that

19   was in a 1959 report from their advertising firm,

20   William Estey Company, and they � I think that was for

21   two years of the study.  I didn't show the similar

22   report for 1964 or the NFO surveys that was done, which

23   included teenagers, and there are many internal

24   documents that talk about their marketing strategies

25   which included �

1       Q    We're going to look at those in a moment.  So

2   let me follow-up with what you just said about surveys.

3   The one we saw in your direct examination was from 1959?

4       A    Yeah.  It was a '59 document reporting two

5   years of the survey, '58, '59.

6       Q    How old was Mr. Price in 1958 and 1959?

7       A    He would have been 22 or 23.

8       Q    Was there any indication that 22 or 23-year-old |

9   John Price was in high school in 1959 or 1959?

10       A    No.                                                                                                     |

11       Q    Did you show any document involving the

12   surveying of high school students at the time when Mr.

13   Price was in high school?

14       A    I don't believe we did.  There was a 1953 Roper |

15   poll that included 15 year olds.  That was � we did

16   show �                                                                                                               |

17       Q    Now, let me get back to my questions of these

18   documents.  These documents aren't taking about polls or |

19   surveys, are they?

20       A    No.  This is actually setting up the trade

21   building around schools.

22       Q    So that's what I want to ask you about.  Do you |

23   remember your presentation on your direct examination,

24   coming into court with access to an indexed group of 80

25   million pages of the documents, did we see a single

1   document indicating that during the time of Mr. Price's

2   minority someone was going on to high schools, colleges,

3   or universities for trade building?

4       A    I don't believe we did.

5       Q    Did we see a single document from Mr. Price's

6   lifetime from 1936 all the way up into the new

7   millennium, did we see a single document that indicated

8   that Reynolds was going on to high schools, colleges or

9   universities doing any sort of trade building activity?

10       A    Yes, we did.  I would say the 20/20, 1983

11   report by John Stossell, which provides an in-depth look

12   of things that Reynolds was doing to make their products

13   attractive to young people at that time, rock concerts,

14   sponsorship of soccer, and movie placements and so on.

15       Q    I'm so sorry, Dr. Cummings.  I'm not asking you

16   about rock concerts, okay?  You showed these documents

17   talking about going on to schools.

18       A    Uh-huh.

19       Q    Did you show the jury a single document during

20   Mr. Price's lifetime where someone is telling people to

21   go to prep schools, colleges, or universities to � I

22   don't know what this � hand out cigarettes, trade

23   bills, whatever it is?

24       A    Well, again, the 20/20 show shows the sampling

25   of free samples of product to underage individuals.

1   That was 1983.  I'm just trying to recall.  There are

2   many documents.

3       Q    You think the 20/20 episode showed people going

4   on to the campus of prep schools, colleges, or

5   universities?

6       A    No.  It was outside the Talking Heads �

7       Q    Well, that's �

8       A    � and David Bowie concerts that they were

9   handing out the samples.

10       Q    All right.  I won't keep doing this.  I'll just

11   try one last time.

12       A    Sure.

13       Q    This will be the last time.  I'm talking about

14   these two documents you showed from before Mr. Price was

15   born, talking about going on to high schools, colleges,

16   and universities.

17       A    Right.

18       Q    Do you understand?

19       A    I do.

20       Q    I'm sorry.  Just one moment, I'm not asking you

21   about rock concerts or 20/20 episodes.  Did we see

22   during your direct examination a single document from

23   Mr. Price's lifetime talking about going on to a high

24   school, prep school, college, University, summer school

25   to trade build?  Yes or no?

7       Q    So, so far we've seen two documents, the one we

8   saw on your direct that says 13 to 24 �

9       A    Right.

10       Q    � and the one from the month before that says

11   18 to 34, right, that we didn't see until now; is that

12   right?

13            MR. PRYSOCK:  Do you have an extra copy of the

14       other one, the one from �

15            MR. WALKER:  Of your exhibit that you already

16       used?                                                                                                           1

18            MR. WALKER:  I don't know that I do.

19            MR. PRYSOCK:  What's the date on it? 2 0                           MR. WALKER:  You can have it.

21       Q    So far we've seen the one that we saw in direct

22   that said 13, right?

2 3       A    That's right.

24       Q    And then in cross we've just seen the one from

25   the month before that says 18, right?

Page 2425 A    Right.  Marketing strategy.

Q    And you knew about both of them.

A    Sure.  There's many documents, actually.  I think these were test market strategies and then they finally introduced the wide circuit of Camel cigarettes as part of the Joe Camel brand varieties that came out.

Q    Tell me if you've seen this document from October 23.  This is right after the document that you showed.  Project LF, October 23, 1987.  Do you see that?

A    Yep, I do.

Q    Target, 18 to 34 males with primary emphasis on the 18 to 24 group.  Right?

That's what this document says.

Okay.  Now �

Q right?

A    Sure.  There are many.  There are hundreds of pages on project LF and a variety of the other Camel varieties that came out in that era.

Q    Hundreds of pages of documents �

A    Thousands probably, I'm underestimating.

1       A    That's right.

2       Q    September, the one I showed, October, the one

3   you showed in the middle, and this one right after it

4   also in October.

5       A    That's true.

6       Q    And the only one of the hundreds or thousands

7   or whatever it is that you say they are on this project

8   LF, the only one that we saw during your direct

9   examination was the one that said 13.

10       A    Yes.  That's the only one we showed on my

11   direct.

12       Q    Let me show you another document you showed on

13   this topic.  This is PT 1950.  Remember that we saw this

14   document in your direct examination?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    I want to go back to it.  This is 1975.  This

17   is Brown & Williamson document, right?

18       A    That's right.

19       Q    All right.  And it's from a Mr. Pittman. 2 0       A    That's right.

21       Q    You won't know the answer but no relation to

22   our juror Pittman.

23       A    I wouldn't know the answer to that question. 2 4       Q    You don't know but we can agree it's no

25       relation.  It says:  "From time to time when describing

1       A    That's what it says.

2       Q    And then it says to use � to include the word

3   adult when they're talking about what they are talking

4   about, right?

5       A    It says in the future when describing the low

6   age end of the cigarette business.

7       Q    Right.

8       A    "Please use the term young adult smoker or

9   young adult smoking market."  That's what it says.

10       Q    Right.  And an 18-year old smoker would be on

11   the low age end of the adult smoking market; is that

12   true?

13       A    Well, I would actually describe the low age end

14   of the market as it's described in the internal business

15   records at this time.

16       Q    We're going to get to that.

18       Q    Do you think 14 and 15 year olds are adults?

19       A    No.  I do not.  But I would describe them as 2 0       the low end of the market based on what I know about

21   smoke patterns.

22       Q    Back to my question.  Would you agree with me

23   that the low age end of the adult smoking market would 2 4        be 18?

	We'll find it for you.  Here it is.

2
	Q
	All right.  As you all know, the objectives of

3
	RJR's marketing activities are to convince existing
	
4
	smokers
	to select our brands rather than our

5
	competit

6
	A
	That's right.

7
	Q
	"More to the point, it is not" -- and not is

8
	underlined, right?
	
9
	A
	It is underlined.

10
	Q
	"Not our business to motivate people to start

11
	smoking,
	particularly minors.  To smoke or not to smoke

12
	is a personal decision which we do not try to

	Do you see that?

15
	A
	I do.

	Q
	Now, let me ask you about this document.  At

19
	Q
	This was an internal Reynolds document, right?

20
	A
	It was.

	Then one of the group of documents you've been

22
	calling

1       A    That's right.  Until they became available on

2   the websites.

3        Q    This is one of those documents that didn't

4   become available until the 1990s.

5       A    Late nineties, yes.

6       Q    It wasn't destroyed.  It's available to us to

7   see now, right?

8       A   Well, part of the document has been altered or

9   redacted but, yes, you can see the part that's not

11        Q    It's on your reliance list, you just said.

12       A    It is.

13        Q    You knew about it before you came to trial.

14       A    I did.

15        Q    And it's a private communication within the

16   company talking about what the company's position is

17   about whether the company's business is to motivate

18   people to start smoking.

19       A    Actually, the subject of the memo is Younger

21        Q    Okay.  You don't agree that this document is

22   addressing the question of whether it's Reynolds

23   business to motivate people to start smoking,

24   particularly minors?

1       Q    Okay.  Then in the next paragraph it says:

2    "Given this policy it is important that we do not do

3   anything that would leave the false impression that our

4   real intentions are otherwise."

5            Right?

6       A    Yes.

7       Q    Let's look at another one.  This is an RJR

8   confidential document, right?

9       A    Yes.

10       Q    Plaintiff's Exhibit 1479, copy has been handed

11   to Mr. Prysock.

12       A    Okay.

13       Q    And this is another one of those internal,

14   secret documents that didn't come available until the

15   nineties and wasn't destroyed as part of your 80 million

16   pages that you have indexed and knew about before you

17   came to trial.  That's like eight questions.  It's not

18   proper but I'm trying to move things along.  Do you

19   agree with all of that?

20       A    I agree that this was not available to the

21   public.  It didn't become available until 1999.

22       Q    Was it internal?

23       A    Yes.

4       Q    Did you know about it �

5       A    I'm not sure when this went up.  I would have

6   to go check the website because there's � different

8   came available.

16   if it helps you remember this document.  Oh, just to be

17   clear, this document is one we certainly didn't see

18   during your direct examination.

20   from Mr. Hall but I just would have to see the document

9             Did I read that correctly?

10       A    You did.

11        Q    "It is not designed to be used as a tool for

12   developing marketing strategies for this population

13   group."

14             Did I read that correctly?

16       Q    Did we see, hear, or even hear about this

17   information during your direct examination?

18       A    Yes, we did.  I think I testified that the

19   company's publicly told members of Congress and anybody

20   else who asked that they don't study the smoking habits

21   of young people and they don't target young people with

22   their marketing in any way.  And that was a consistent

23   position so this would be contrary to this consistent

24   public statement.

1   secret document where Reynolds is privately saying it is

2   not designed to be used as a tool for developing

3   marketing strategies for this population group?

4       A    I don't dispute the fact that it says that.

5   And they're studying the smoking habits of 14 to 17 year |

6   olds �                                                                                                               |

7       Q    Dr. Cummings �

8       A    � if I didn't comment on �

9       Q    I'm not sure where you're looking but I want to f

10   ask you about this.  All right?  My question is, did you |

11   tell � did we hear during your direct examination that

12   Reynolds' private, internal secret documents indicated

13   that while the behavior of 14 to 17 year olds was

14   analyzed to forecast future trends, it is not designed

15   to be used as a tool for developing marketing strategies

16   for this population group?

17       A    I don't know whether we stated that.  I don't

18   dispute it, that it's written there.

19       Q    All right.  How about this one?  This is a

2 0       document that we did see during your direct examination,

21       right?

2 2       A    Yes.                                                                                                  f

24   opportunities, 1984, Diane Burrows," right?

1       Q    By the way, this is another internal, secret

2   document that didn't become available until the 1990s,

3   right?

4       A    That's true.

5       Q    This is not a document that was sent � that

6   was created to communicate anything at all to the

7   general public about what Reynolds was doing.

8       A    No.  It was � the purpose is clearly outlined.

9       Q    All right.  A few things here.  First, one of

10   the parts of this document that you talked about, and

11   even mentioned a few moments ago, is this passage right

12   here, right?

13       A    Yes.

14       Q    "Younger adult smokers have been the critical

15   factor in the growth and decline of every major brand

16   and company over the last 50 years," right?

17       A    That's right.

18       Q    And it's talking about younger adult smokers?

19       A    Yes.

20       Q    And according to you in this document, younger

21   adult smokers means under 18.

22       A    Yeah.  You can go to, I think it's on page 7 or

23   8, there's a chapter 1, and they refer to Appendix B,

24   when they define the term and I think that's where they

25   showed the age of starting smoking under the title

1   replacement smoker.

2       Q    We're going to � I'm going to follow-up with

3   you about that in a moment.

4       A    Okay.

5       Q    I just want to make sure that's still your

6   position.  Right now I want to ask you about this

7   paragraph.

8       A    Sure.

9       Q    "Younger adult smokers have been the critical

10   factor in the growth and decline of every major brand

11   and company over the last 50 years.  They will continue

12   to be just as important to brands/companies in the

13   future."

14             Right?

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    And this is the passage that you say shows that

17   the companies you call the lookback.  According to you,

18   this says that in the prior 50 years the growth and

19   decline of every major brand was due to the marketing to

20   underage smokers; is that right?

21       A    Well, not just because of this particular

22   statement.  I'm talking about my knowledge of the entire

23   document where they do the lookback and they talk about

24   successful brands, starting with Camel, Lucky Strike,

25   and Chesterfield in the thirties, the forties and into

2
	brands in the fifties, the sixties, the seventies up in

3
	to 1984.  And they actually give a description of each

4
	of the brands �

	Q    We're going to look at that.

6
	A    Okay, so �                                      ;

7
	Q    Right now, my question is, do you now agree

8
	with me that this statement talking about the last 50

9
	years doesn't refer to anything having to do with

10
	marketing to underage people?

11

12
	Q    It simply �

13
	A    I disagree with that.

14
	Q    It simply doesn't say that, does it?

15
	A    Well, they're looking for strategies and

16
	opportunities.

17
	Q    Does it say that the growth and decline of

18
	every major brand was due to marketing to people under

19
	the age of 18; yes or no?

20
	A    Yes.                                               ;

21
	Q    You think that's in this paragraph.

	A    No.  I'm talking about the entire document, the

23
	appendices that they have, Appendix B, the NFO �

marketing on the uptake and the success of those brands

at different time periods, which is were I answered yes

to your question on the marketing.

Q    Okay.  I'll only ask you one last time then

I'11 move on.

Sure .

carefully. BY MR. WALKER:

Q    I'm talking about this one paragraph.  These two sentences, okay?

A    Okay.

Q    Can you now agree with me that these two sentences do not say that the growth and decline of every major brand and company was due to marketing cigarettes to people under the age of 18?  That information is not there, is it?

A    Not in those two sentences.

3
	A
	Okay.                                            I

4
	Q
	But right here on this first page, it says,

5
	"this is
	intended to assist RJR in optimizing its

6
	strategic position with respect to younger adult smokers
	
7
	18 to 24

	Yes.                                             i

9
	Q
	Can you agree with me that that's defining

10
	younger
	adult smokers as people age 18 to 24?

11
	A
	Yes.                                             \

12
	Q
	Later in the document, even just under the

13
	passage
	we just looked at, they're talking about 18 year ii

14
	old smok
	ers, right?

15
	A
	Yeah.  They � just 18 year old smokers.

16
	Q
	Here they're talking about 18 year old smokers,

17
	right?
	

18
	A
	Right, 18 year old smokers far outweigh any

19
	switch with age.

	Q
	"The annual influx of 18 year old smokers

21
	provides

	right?

23
	A
	Correct.  With a little asterisk there.

2
	A    Yeah.  Rather than switchers, 19 to 24.

3
	Q    Sure.  Rather than people who are 19 to 24.

4
	A    That's right.

5
	Q    Okay.  Now, you would agree with me, would you

6
	not, that if we were to look through this document, we

7
	would find somewhere in the neighborhood of 200

8
	references to younger adult smokers as being age 18 and

9
	over.

10
	A    Yes.  I would agree with you.  I think that was

11
	the task I went through in one of my depositions.  I

12
	counted them up.

13
	Q    I want to show you something.  This is a

14
	Plaintiff's Exhibit, 3400, and at the bottom of each

15
	page you see there's a Bates number.  You're familiar

16
	with that, right?

17
	A    I am.

18
	Q    And that tells you the one that goes 0002, that

19
	tells you that's the second page of this document,

1   talking about and that you talked about on direct.  All

2   right.  This is the chart that you were talking about

3   that's in the back of the document, right?

4       A    Well, this is the appendix.  I think it's

5   referenced in the first chapter when they talk about

6   young adult smokers.

7        Q    The appendix at the back is the place where

8   there are -- there's information provided about

9   underage, right?

10       A    This is one of the places.  There's some

11   others.

12        Q    This is the one that we saw during your direct

13   examination.  Right?

14       A    Yes, it is.

15        Q    And it's on page 65 of this document, right?

16       A    That's right.  It's about an 84 page document,

17    I believe.

18        Q    84 pages.  And this isn't data that Reynolds

19   collected.  The source for this data is:  "HEW data

20   reported in adult use of tobacco, 1970 to 1975."

21             True?

22       A    True.  I think I explained that earlier.

23        Q    HEW is Health, Education & Welfare, right?

24       A    That's right.  It's a government survey.

1   the results of which were publicly available and

2   reported in this appendix.

3       A    True.

4       Q    And you said � what was the page you said that

5   cites to that?

6       A    If you hand me the document I would be happy to

7   show you.  I don't have it here nor all the pages

8   memorized.  Page 2.  And it's Bates 10.

9       Q    Thank you.  I was going to ask you �

10       A    And then there are some additional ones when

11   you look at, for example, on page 9, Bates 18, and then

12   there's some other ones that are talking about the

13   specific brands.  They give some charts.

14       Q    Okay.  Bates 10, right?

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    Okay.  Appendix B, right?

17       A    Right.

18       Q    And the information that's being pulled from

19   the appendix is about people, the percentage of people

20   who start smoking after age 18, right?

21       A    Well, it does.  That whole paragraph actually

22   is relevant.

23       Q    And then the other that is right that's being

24   pulled from the appendix is the part about smokers who

25   start after age 24, right?

1       A    Yes.  And it talks about if, you know, "young

2   adults turn away from smoking, the industry must

3   decline, just as a population which does not give birth

4   will eventually dwindle.  In such an environment a

5   positive RJR sales trend would require disproportionate

6   share, gains, price increase, depressed volume."

7       Q    Smokers who start after the age of 18, would

8   you agree are young adult smokers?

9       A    Sure.

10       Q    Smokers who start after age 24, are they young

11   adult smokers?

12       A    No.  I think we would call them adult smokers.

13       Q    On that same page that you're talking about,

14   younger adults is defined as 18 to 24, right?

15       A    That's right.

16       Q    All right.  Talking about smoking past age 25,

17   right?

18       A    That's right.

19       Q    Smokers age 18 to 24, again, right? 2 0       A    That's right.

21       Q    18 year old smokers, later on the same page,

22   right?

23       A    Yeah.  They use that term, 18 year old smokers,

24   many times and then they show trends for the over 18 or

1   versus the 18 group.  And my research has shown that the

2   18 group is the group of smokers that are below 18, up

3   to 18.

4       Q    Dr. Cummings, I'm not asking you about your

5   research.  I'm asking you about this internal document

6   that we saw on your direct.

7       A    I'm referring to my research on this internal

8   document and so that's what I was referring to and �

9   such as the MDS and SDS surveys, the NFO's that were

10   done.  Those were also in the appendices of this

11   document.

12       Q    You know from your research that to get to the

13   page that has the appendix that we saw on your direct

14   examination, you've got to get through some 60 pages of

15   this memo, right?

16       A    That's right.

17       Q    You've got to get past the memo itself and look

18   at the appendix, right?

19       A    Yeah.  You want to.

20       Q    And you've got to pass hundreds of references

21   to 18 to 24, right?

22       A    Yes.  Plus do other research on the studies

23   that were the basis for the material in the appendices

24   which are the data that they're referencing in the 2 5        study.

1       Q    And because you said that you have done

2   research on this document, you know it inside and out,

3   right?

4       A    I do.

5       Q    You know about this language in the

6   introduction.

7       A    I do.

8       Q    By the way, before I read it, did we see this

9   page, this information here during your direct

10   examination?

11       A    No.  We didn't show this particular page but my

12   assumption was the entire document would be available.

13       Q    All 80 pages.

14       A    All 84, I'm hoping.

15       Q    And you didn't think it was important to

16   highlight this page?

17       A    I think I � I didn't think it was important

18   because � I can explain.  Because the public position

19   of the company has always been that they don't market to

20   youth and they just restate that in this document.

21       Q    Dr. Cummings, I'm sorry, I thought we

22   established, do you still agree with me, this document

23   sets forth the company's � this is a private document,

24   right?

25       A    Yes, it is.

1       Q    Okay.  Let's see what Reynolds was saying

2   privately about this.  "RJR's consistent policy is that

3   smoking is a matter of free, informed, adult choice,

4   which the company does not seek to influence.  However,

5   in order to plan our business, we must consider the

6   effects those choices may have on the future of the

7   industry.  Furthermore, if we are to compete

8   effectively, we must recognize the imperative to know

9   and meet the wants of those who are 18 and have already

10   elected to smoke, as well as those of older smokers."

11             Right?

12       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

13       Q    Then down below it says:  "This report is

14   intended to provide additional learning on younger adult

15   smokers aged 18 to 24 to assist RJR in optimizing its

16   strategic position with respect to this smoker group."

17             Right?

18       A    Correct.                                                                                          f

19       Q    All right.  Now, you said a few minutes ago

20   that there are charts in this document, which are

21   talking about what some of the successful brands were in |

22   various points in time, right? 2 3       A    That's right.

24       Q    And one of those brands that's looked at is

25   Kool cigarettes, right?

1       A   Yes.

2       Q    For example, there's this section on successful

3   first brand strategies of the past and then it goes

4   through a number of different ones until eventually you

5   reach the paragraph or the section, if you will, talking

6   about Kool cigarettes, right?

7       A    That's right.

8       Q    Okay.  And there's a chart.  You mentioned

9   there were charts.

10       A    Right.

11       Q    There's this chart on the next page that charts

12   out the share of the overall market?

13       A    That's right.

14       Q    For Kool cigarettes over time, right?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    And it plots out the share of the market for 18

17   year old smokers specifically over time, right?

18       A    The under 18 group, the SDS, I think it's

19   referenced in the charts.

20       Q    You think it's under 18.

21       A    Yeah.  I mean, I've looked at the FDA studies

22   that they've done, that Reynolds did.  This is one of

23   their segmentation studies where they looked at

24   different segments of the market.

25       Q    I'm so sorry, Dr. Cummings, I don't mean to ask

1   you about any other document other than this one we saw

2   in your direct.

3       A    I'm referring to that one.

4       Q    Okay.  Now, I thought I heard you say on

5   direct, and I want you to correct me if I'm wrong, that

6   Kool cigarettes was a popular brand among youth in the

7   1950s.                                                                                                                  |

8       A    No.  I'll correct you if I'm wrong.  It

9   actually grew in popularity and became a youth brand in

10   the seventies.  It did have a share but it wasn't as

11   strong, relative to the overall share for Kool in the

12   youth market really until the late sixties, early

13   seventies and then it was one of the top selling brands

14   among teenagers at that time.

15       Q    Okay.  So it would be incorrect to say that

16   Kool brand cigarettes were popular among youth smokers

17   in the 1950s.

18       A    It wasn't among the most popular brands.  It

19   didn't have excess share relative to its total share

20   unlike, for example, Pall Mall.  I think I had mentioned |

21   Winston in the fifties and sixties.

22       Q    Here's what I'm asking.  I would like you to

23   assume that the jury has heard and will hear evidence

24   that Mr. Price smoked Kool cigarettes from 1952 to 1954.

2 5       A    Okay.                                                                                                f

1       Q    Are you telling this jury that from 1952 to

2   1954 Kool brand cigarettes were popular among 18 year

3   old smokers or even under 18, if that's your

4   interpretation of the chart?

5       A    Well, it's under 18 actually.  It's up to age

6   18.  That is my interpretation of the chart.  But, no,

7   Kool was a growing brand, but it wasn't excessively

8   popular among teens.  Some teenagers did smoke it but it

9   wasn't among the most popular teenager brands at the

10   time.  I could tell you what those brands were, they

11   were Lucky Strike and Camel and Pall Mall in the early

12   fifties.

13       Q    And because you haven't looked at the

14   depositions, you don't know whether Mr. Price smokes any |

15   of those three brands in this time period of �

16       A    I don't.

17       Q    Okay.  All right.  So here's what I want to do.

18   This is �                                                                                                        |

19            MR. WALKER:  Can I have the Elmo just one 2 0       second?

21       Q    This is the chart that you and I have been

22   talking about, right?

2 3       A    Uh-huh.  Right.

24       Q    It's a little hard to read.  I've blown it up.

2 5                           MR. WALKER:  Can I have that, please?

	THE WITNESS:  It's the dash line.

2
	Q
	This is the dash line we were just looking at,

3
	right?
	

4
	A
	Yes.                                             \

5
	Q
	And at the top it indicates that the solid line

6
	was the
	overall market share of Kool cigarettes, right?

7
	A
	That's right.

8
	Q
	And then as you were just trying to tell me,

9
	the das
	hed line here?

10
	A
	Yep.

11
	Q
	That's the line that indicates the share of the

12
	market.
	Here it says 18 year old, right?

13
	A
	It does.  Although if you look at the footnote

14
	to the
	chart it's those SDS studies which are in the

15
	reference to the document which is under 18.
	
16
	Q
	So your testimony is that where it says 18 year l

17
	old share, it really means under 18.
	
18
	A
	It's all smokers up to age 18.

19
	Q
	Okay.  Let's talk about all smokers up to age

20
	18.

	Okay.                                            i

	Q
	Do you see on the left side of the graph there

	are the

24

	I do.

25

	Each tick is a 2 percent up to 10 percent and

1   then up to 20; do you see that?

2       A    I do.

3       Q    And then across the bottom you can see the

4   years, right?  This is what we talked about, it charts

5   the market share over the year.

6       A    That's right.

7       Q    And looks like it charts 1930, which is not

8   written, and then there's 1940, and then there's 1950.

9       A    That's right.

10       Q    And then 1960, right?

11       A    Correct.

12       Q    So to make it easier for the jury, we've drawn

13   a line highlighting the portions that are 1952 to 1953.

14   Do you see that?

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    Isn't it true, Dr. Cummings, that from this

17   chart, in the document that we saw with the jury during

18   your direct examination, the data indicates that the

19   total 18 year old market share, or the total market

20   share up to 18, for those years, was under 2 percent?

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    And not only was Kool not a popular brand

23   amongst 18 year old smokers or even people under age 18,

24   the best it could capture during those years was

25   somewhere less than 2 percent; is that right?

12       up first.

13             THE WITNESS:  Do I need to step out?

14             MR. PRYSOCK:  Yeah, probably just step out for a

15       second.  Thank you.

22       those cannot be disputed.

23             The � the defense just spent the last 30 to 45

contradictory to the Engle findings, Your Honor.  And

this jury's left with the misimpression that, well,

maybe there wasn't a conspiracy.  Maybe there wasn't

fraud.  Maybe there wasn't concealment.

We would simply ask that the Court instruct the jury that the Engle findings are not to be disputed and that if he's a class member, those findings apply.

THE COURT:  I can assure you �

MR. PRYSOCK:  And � and read the findings.

THE COURT:  � when I instruct the jury on the law that they will apply.  I cannot imagine that the Engle findings will not be a part of the instructions.  I'm not going to � I'm not saying it's curative.  And I definitely believe then when you bring in certain documents, they have every right to show other parts of documents or documents that are similar in nature.  So I just don't have a problem with that.

MR. PRYSOCK:  And I understand that, Your Honor. The problem � the problem becomes �

MR. PRYSOCK:  Right.  And � and that's the purpose of a curative instruction, Your Honor, is when something runs afoul of that and we're in a two-week trial --

THE COURT:  I don't think it's run afoul.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Mr. Walker's going to be in questioning for the next several hours, and this jury's now left with the misimpression, over that time period, until closing or until the jury instructions.

THE COURT:  No.  Because you're going to get redirect.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, I can't ask him about the Engle findings and, you know, all those matters of law with Dr. Cummings.  I mean, the jury's going to be sitting here all afternoon and tomorrow and until Mon-� until Tuesday probably, with the misimpression that, well, maybe they didn't commit conspiracy.  Maybe they didn't commit fraud.

And that's exactly why we read them the instructions in the beginning.  But we need a curative. I've never seen someone do what is being done here as far as disputing the actual Engle findings, which they are not allowed to do.

THE COURT:  Your -- your request is denied.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Hold on.  I'm sorry.

THE COURT:  Got another thing?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.  One other thing, Your Honor.  In this case, before trial, the defense filed a motion to preclude us from attacking the way the case was being defended.  We had a hearing on it.  We said we weren't to do that, and we haven't done that, Your Honor.

The defense has spent the better part of this � of this cross examination attacking how the plaintiff is prosecuting the case, insinuating that we are only doing certain documents, that we didn't bring documents, that we didn't put up documents.  They have now opened the door, Your Honor, for us to be able to talk about the way that the defense is being presented in this case by doing that.  It was their motion.  We agreed to it.

THE COURT:  I don't know what you're talking about.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Every other guestion to Dr. Cummings, "And you didn't show the jury this in direct."  This � instead of saying, you didn't show it, he's now saying, "This wasn't shown to you on direct."

But that's not proper.

THE COURT:  How � how did the jury know that

being placed so that they know that this is a document

that wasn't shown in direct?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Because �

THE COURT:  I don't think that the implication that you're -- that you see there is the way it's been done, other than -- now, sometimes Dr. Cummings -- it ends up happening several times because Dr. Cummings doesn't just say "yes."

But the fact is I � I � I suspect that the jury doesn't memorize every document that they've already seen.  The documents look fairly similar and I think that when he points out that this is something that they've never seen, that -- that that's useful for that particular purpose.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Judge, the � it's being done to insinuate that we're hiding the ball.  That's exactly what it's being done for, and that is the impression that the jury's left with.

THE COURT:  I �

MR. PRYSOCK:  Whichever terms he couches it in, that is the impression that the jury's left with.  If they're going to do that, then their motion that they asked for, they've opened the door on that, and we will do the same thing.

Anyway, that's my ruling.

MR. MITNIK:  Can � can I just ask for clarification on that?

THE COURT:  No.  It's my ruling.

MR. MITNIK:  It's not � I'm not asking you to re-rule.  I just want you -- it seems the distinction you're making, so I know � because going forward, I don't want to run afoul of what you're saying.

It -- it would be okay to say the defense in this case is doing this and this, don't mention the lawyers. That's the point.

THE COURT:  No.  I don't think so.  It's going to be a situation-by-situation basis.  If -- if the defense shows some sort of document and they � and then you showed some other document, I don't have any problem

2       alerted that it's not a document that they've seen.

3             MR. MITNIK:  Is it appropriate for them to suggest

1        Q     Okay.  Before the break, we finished our

2   discussion about Kool cigarettes, or we finished what I

3   wanted to ask you about Kool in the early 1950s.

4              I'd like you to assume that before the age of 18,

5   Mr. Price smoked Wings brand cigarettes.

6              That was on that list that you got from

7   plaintiff's counsel, right?

8        A     Correct.

9        Q     All right.  And the document that we were just

10   looking at that talks about -- that shows the market shares,

11   it does not identify Wings brand cigarettes as a youth brand

12   or as a brand that was popular with people under the age of

13   18 at any point in time, does it?

14        A     That '84 document does not.

15        Q     Okay.  All right.

16              MR. WALKER:  Can I have the ELMO?

17        Q     So once again, because it's been a few days since

18   we saw this, this is the information that you had for this

19   case about the brands that Mr. Price smoked, right?

20        A     That's right.

21        Q     And you had this information before you took the

22        stand  obviously.

23                 A           I   did.

24                 Q           Okay.      Can  you   agree   with  me   that   Raleigh  brand

25        cigarettes   does   not   appear  anywhere   on  this   list?

	showed -- I think there were two or three of

	arettes or something of that nature, right?

7

	Yes, Addison Yeaman, from Brown & Williamson.

	Okay.  And that was -- those documents about

9
	Raleigh b
	rand cigarettes being used for Ralettes, again,

10
	that's a
	cigarette that as far as you know, Mr. Price never

	smoked, Raleigh?

	True, yeah.

	that were
	made by R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company that

	All right.  In 1950, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco

1       Q     The CDC reported that cigarettes -- cigarette

2   smoking rates among high school students have dropped to the

3   lowest levels since the national youth risk behavior survey

4   began back in 1991, right?

5       A     Correct.

6       Q     According to the CDC, the smoking rate amongst

7   teenagers is now at 15.7 percent, right?

8       A     Yeah, past 30-day use, I think that is.

9   Actually � yeah, past 30-day use.

10       Q     Any smoking within the past 30 days, right?

11       A     Yes.

12       Q     If you're looking at daily smoking, the number �

13   the percentage is even lower than 15.7 percent, correct?

14       A     Yes, absolutely, way lower.

20       Q     And the health objective from the CDC in the

21   Health -- Healthy People 2020 report was to reduce

22   adolescent cigarette use to 16 percent or less, right?

23       A     That's right.

1       A     Correct.

2       Q     And, in fact, the CDC's statistics show that that

3   objective was actually met in 2013, seven years earlier,

11   reliable institution, and you're familiar with the

12   Monitoring the Future studies that Michigan puts out,

13   right?

14       A     Yes.  Michigan's very reliable.  I went there to

15   do my graduate work there, and I know the investigators who

16   run the Monitoring the Future studies.  Goes back to the

17   mid '70s.

18       Q     And that report, Monitoring the Future, said about

19   teen smoking that since 19- -- the 1996, 1997 time frame,

20   the rates of current � again, any smoking in the past 30

21   days -- "Cigarette smoking for youth has fallen by nearly

22   80 percent amongst 8th graders, 70 percent amongst

23   10th graders and over 50 percent amongst 12th graders."

1        Q     I think you showed something or mentioned

2    something from James Bowling at PM?

3        A     I did.  I think he was quoted in the article The

4   Wall Street Journal, "Defending the Weed."  I think that's

5   the title of the article.

6        Q     Now, we saw during your direct examination

7   certainly that those statements were being made over time.

8   But isn't it true that increasingly over time, the American

9   people became incredibly skeptical of the statements that

10   they heard from tobacco industry representatives, like the

11   people we just named?

12        A     Yes.

13        Q     Going back to the 1950s, in fact, the American

14   public was very skeptical of the claims made by people

15   representing the industry, right?

16        A     Sure.

17        Q     Let's look at some examples of that.  Let's look

18   at one first from Reader's Digest in 1962, please.

1    'old data without new research findings,' but the statement

2   sounded weaker and more pathetic than ever."

3              Did I read that right?

4        A     You did.

5        Q     That is a statement of skepticism about what

6   people in the tobacco industry were saying publicly about

7   the health risks of smoking, right?

8        A     Your common rejoinder had � had been proven, that

9   smoking caused harm.

10        Q     All right.  You're familiar with the Roper polling

11   organization, right?

12        A     I am.

13        Q     And you know that there have been Roper polls

14   going back to the 1950s, asking the public, who would they

15   be most apt to believe regarding information on lung cancer

16   and cigarette smoking, right?

17        A     Yes.

18        Q     And even before the 1962 article, we � we looked

19   at, there was a Roper poll in 1959 in which the question was

20   asked, who would you be most apt to believe if one of these

21   organizations said, there was no connection whatsoever

22   between lung cancer and cigarette smoking, right?

23        A     Yes.

1       Q     These are the results of that study, are they

2   not?

3       A     Yes, they are.

4       Q     "Who would you be most apt to believe if one of

5   these organizations said, there was no connection whatsoever

6   between lung cancer and cigarette smoking?"

7             And at the very bottom, only 3 percent of those

8   who responded mentioned the Tobacco Industry Research

9   Council or the TIRC that you talked about on direct; is that

10   right?

11       A     Yes.

12       Q     Ten years later or so, in 1968, a similar Roper

13   survey was done to try to figure out � to look at this

14   question of who the American people felt were among the most

15   reliable sources of information on this, right?

16       A     Yes.  I'm familiar with that.  I think they

17   extended the choices that were given to respond.

18             MR. WALKER:  Let's pull that one up.

20   reliable sources of information on smoking and health?"

21             And only 5 percent responded that the tobacco

22   companies were among the most reliable sources of

23   information on smoking and health, right?

24       A     That's right.

1   survey was done on a similar topic, right?

2       A     Correct.

3       Q     "Here is a list of different kinds of

4   organizations.  Would you look down this list and tell me

5   which one or two you would consider to be the most reliable

6   sources of information on smoking and health?"

7             You have organizations like the American Cancer

8   Society, independent research laboratories and so forth, but

9   for the tobacco companies, only 3 percent said that the

10   tobacco companies were among the most reliable sources of

11   information on smoking and health, right?

12       A     That's what the poll said, yes.

13       Q     All right.  In 1972, Roper did another survey,

14   right?

15       A     They did.

16             MR. WALKER:  By the way, could we pull that up,

17       please?

18       Q     This is during the same period of time that the

19   statements, press releases, television appearances by

20   tobacco company presidents, TI representatives and so

21   forth � this is the same time period in the '60s and '70s,

22   right? -- when those things were going on.

23       A     Right, like the white papers, where they would

25   industry.  I mentioned the special projects and how they �

1   how they had funded those scientists but that was unknown.

2   So they were � they knew they had a credibility problem,

3   which is why they executed that strategy.

4        Q     All right.  Let's take a look at the poll from

5   1972.  "Here's a list of six different kinds of

6   organizations.  Would you look down this list and tell me

7   which one or two you would consider the most reliable

8   sources of information on smoking and health?"

9              Only 4 percent said the tobacco companies,

10   right?

11        A     That's right.

12        Q     96 percent of the people who answered this poll

13   did not indicate that the tobacco companies were among the

14   most reliable sources on smoking and health, right?

15        A     That is true.

16        Q     Let's move forward to 1980.  1980 was the year of

17   that "need to know" video that you showed, right?

18        A     No.  That was the early '70s.

19        Q     All right.  Didn't you show a TI video, the one

20   with all the '70s music, that -- that was from TI?

21        A     I did.  And I think that was the "need to know."

22   That was the early '70s.  I think in the 1980s, we showed

23   the video of William Dwyer � 2 4       Q     Okay.

25       A     -- at the Mayflower hotel, issuing the white paper

1   and basically � or it was actually '79.  But then there was

2   a report in 1980, talking about how they successfully

3   preempted the �

4       Q     Yeah.

5       A     -- the Surgeon General's Report.

6       Q     So I got my dates mixed up.

7       A     Sure.

8       Q     The "need to know" video was in the '70s, during

9   the time of the polls we just looked at.

10       A     Right, early '70s.

11       Q     And this poll from 1980 was just after the Bill

12   Dwyer video that you showed.

13       A     That's right.

14       Q     Okay.  So the year after the Bill Dwyer video, the

15   poll is done again.  "Which one or two listed organizations

16   are considered the most reliable sources of information on

17   smoking and health?"

18             Bill Dwyer's with The Tobacco Institute?

19       A     That is true.

20       Q     And only 5 percent of people polled said The

21   Tobacco Institute was among the list of reliable sources of

22   information and � right?  Is that correct?

23       A     That is correct.

24       Q     And only 3 percent said the tobacco companies,

25   right?

And they continued this poll the next year, right,

MR. WALKER:  Can we have that, please?

Okay.  Well, let's talk about the � the 1982 poll

At some point, the Roper Organization starts to

8   include in their poll some information about the data that

9   they collected, right?

10       A     Correct.  These were polls that they'd done for

11   The Tobacco Institute.

12       Q     And on Page 35, at the top of the page there, it

13   starts talking about the -- the polling data.  And it says:

14   "The image of the tobacco industry has declined sharply from

15   the 1980 reading.  Starting in 1968, when cigarette

16   manufacturers were making a decidedly positive impression on

17   the public, the trend sloped downward until 1976, when the

18   balance turned negative.  In this report, favorable ratings

19   are at an all-time low, with unfavorable ratings nearly

20   twice as high as favorable ratings."

21             Did I read that right?

22       A     Yes.

23       Q     And it's indicating there that by 1982, 62 percent

24   of respondents had an unfavorable impression of the tobacco

25   industry, right?

1       A     61, I believe it is.

2       Q     61 percent.

3       A     Yeah, that or the congress.  But, yes.

4             MR. WALKER:  All right.  Can we have the next

5       passage?

6       Q     By the way, this poll and this report from 1982,

7   that's the year after Mr. Price turned 45, isn't it?

8       A     I think that would be true.

9       Q     Okay.  "To place public attitudes toward the

10   tobacco industry in context, we have asked respondents their

11   impression of how interested a few major industries are in

12   the safety and welfare of the people who use their products

13   or services.  This year's study shows that the tobacco

14   industry still" � I'm sorry � "This year's study shows the

15   tobacco industry still virtually tied with the liguor

16   industry for last place and both down four points from two

17   years ago and at a record low."

18             Did I read that right?

19       A     You did.

20             MR. WALKER:  All right.  Let's go then to Page 38

21       of the same document, I think it is.

22       Q     Continuing on.  "Since the beginning of these

23   studies for The Tobacco Institute, respondents have been

24   asked what they think the tobacco industry itself believes

25   about the case against cigarettes, that they know it's true

5   63 percent, from 53 percent in 1980."

6             Did I read that right?

7       A     You did.

8       Q     All right.  That means that the year after

9   Mr. Price turned 45, this study indicates that 63 percent of

10   Americans responded that they believe the tobacco

11   industry � sorry -- the tobacco industry itself believes

12   the case against cigarettes but won't admit it.

17   BY MR. WALKER:

18       Q     "Nonsmokers continue to be highly critical of

19   tobacco industry motives, and for the first time, a majority

20   of smokers say the industry knows it's true."

21             So let me follow up with you about that.

22       A     Sure.

23       Q     At this point in time, when Mr. Price is 45 years

24   old, even smokers, the majority of smokers, are saying that

2

	That's true.  It had gone over 50 percent for the

3

	Q

5
	
	MR. WALKER:  You can take that down.

6
	Q
	I won't show it again but the next year after

7
	that, in
	1983, that was the year of the interview that

8
	you've shown with Anne Browder and John Stossel, right?
	
9
	A
	Yes.  That was October of 1983, that � that 20/20 \

10
	clip.
	

11
	Q
	And that's the video, on 20/20, where John Stossel ij

	A
	That's right.

	Q
	And he says to her, "How can you say that

16
	cigarettes are not harmful," in a sort of sarcastic,
	
17

1   sponsor out of the goodness of their hearts, right?

2        A     Yes.

3        Q     And he responds to that with sarcasm too, right?

4        A     Yes, responded to her answer, if that's -- I think

5   she said that that's her belief.  That's � that's why they

6   were sponsoring them.

7        Q     All right.  Okay.  I want to move to a related

8   topic.  We've looked at the polling data.  I believe you

9   said on � in your direct testimony that you believe the

10   conspiracy was successful, and you said -- one of the things

11   that you said was that it dulled quitting, right?

12        A     Yeah.  I said � actually what I said is the

13   internal business records, over time, describe the success

14   of the conspiracy, that it had been a successful defensive

15   operation.

16        Q     We looked at that document earlier, right?

17        A    It had been a successful front and shield and

18   that -- that it had been a brilliantly received and executed

19   strategy to create doubt in the public's mind about the

20   health charges related to smoking without denying it.

21        Q     All right.  So let me ask you this.  We just

22   looked at the polling data on that.

23        A     Okay.

24                 Q           I   want   to   talk  to  you  now  about   the   number  of

1   testified there was this battle back and forth after the

2   1964 Surgeon General's Report.  Okay?

3       A     Sure.

4       Q     And isn't it true that after the Surgeon General's

5   Report in 1964 and the labels went on cigarette packages in

6   1966, in that four-year period, from 1966 to 1970,

7   13 million smokers quit smoking, right?

8       A     True.

9       Q     That's more than 3 million smokers a year.

10       A     Yes.

11       Q     And that is when the largest number of people in

12   history had ever quit smoking over a four-year period,

13   right?

14       A     Yes.  Due to the fairness doctrine, the

15   anti-smoking ads that appeared on television, as a result of

16   that ruling that there had to be an anti-smoking ad placed

17   when they had cigarette ads on prime time.

18       Q     And we looked at some of those public service

19   announcements on Monday. 2 0       A     Right.

21       Q     My question is:  This four-year period, from 1966

22   to 1970, when 13 million smokers quit, that is, according to

23   you, the height of the conspiracy, isn't it?

24       A     Well, the conspiracy, went on for 45 years.  There

25   was no break in the public position, concealing what they

1   knew about the health risks of smoking, nicotine addiction,

2   how the products were engineered, their marketing to youth.

3   That went on, you know, really from the beginning of the

4   Plaza � meetings at the Plaza Hotel in late 1953 and didn't

5   end until 1998.  Never did The Tobacco Institute or CTR ever

6   acknowledge that cigarette smoking was the cause of any harm

7   to human health or that they marketed to kids or any of the

8   other things.

9        Q     So you agree with me that from 1966 to 1970, when

10    13 million Americans guit smoking, the conspiracy that you

11   talked about was in full swing.

12        A     Sure.

13        Q     And if we were to look at a bigger slice, from

14    1964 to 1979, the number of smokers who had guit smoking

15   over that 15-year period has been reported on by the Surgeon

16   General, right?

17        A     Right.  I think they said it was up to 30 million,

18   cumulative, so you � you were getting about 2 million

19   people guitting a year, but out of a total large number of

20   existing smokers.  But --

21        Q     When those 30 million Americans were guitting

22   smoking between 1964 and 1979, the Council For Tobacco

23   Research was in business, right?

24        A     That is true.

25                 Q           Cigarettes   were   still  being  advertised,    right?

1        A     Well, of course, it had changed at that time, but,

2   yes, they were -- directed their marketing and advertising

3   into other venues than television and radio.

4        Q     The Tobacco Institute was in full swing?

5        A     Yes, sir.

6        Q     CTR and TI were making public statements during

7   that time period?

8        A     TI mainly, less for CTR.

9        Q     Including some of the statements you showed,

10   right?

11        A     That's true.

12        Q     Representatives from the tobacco companies

13   themselves made public statements, right?

14        A     They did.

15        Q     And � and the Surgeon General and other members

16   of the public health community were making statements as

17   well, right?

18        A     Yes.  Probably best known was C. Everett Koop in

19   the '80s.

20        Q     And during that period from 1964 to 1979, when all

21   of those things were going on that you talked about, the

22   Surgeon General described that that was an area of

23   unprecedented guitting, right?

24        A     Yes.

1       A     Sure.

2       Q     I'm going to follow up with you about that.  And I

3   want to start by asking you about this question of

4   additives, the things that are used in the manufacture of

5   cigarettes other than tobacco itself.  Okay?

6       A     Sure.

7       Q     Isn't it true that since 1985 tobacco companies

8   have been required to submit to the federal government a

9   list of the ingredients used in the manufacture of

10   commercially available cigarettes?

11       A     True.  But not by brand.  Just a specific list.

12       Q     Since those disclosures began, the companies

13   disclosed to the Department of Health and Human Services

14   that certain additives were present in tobacco � right? �

15   in cigarettes.

16       A    Well, that would be a slight overexaggeration.

17   There � the law actually says the list can only be shared

18   with four people in the federal government.  And I think the

19   head of the Department of Health and Human Services was one

20   of those individuals.  But the list was required by law to

21   be kept under key and not to be divulged.

22       Q    That's the same department of the federal

23   government that the Surgeon General is part of, right?

25   Health and Human Services, and then it � it -- it did have

1   various other � it moved around, the Office on Smoking and

2   Health.  It's now under the auspices of the Center for

3   Disease Control.

4       Q     And the substances that you talked about, like

5   ammonia, diammonium phosphate, the other things that you

6   talked about, are added in the manufacture of some brands.

7   After 19- -- after this period when these disclosures

8   began, those would have been included in the disclosures,

9   right?

10       A     Yes, sir.

11       Q     And the federal government, in response to those

12   submissions, never once told the companies that they needed

13   to remove or stop using any of those additives � and I'm

14   just going to cut it off and � at 1993 -- did they?

15       A     I don't know.

16       Q     As far as you know, you � you've never been made

17   aware of that.

18       A     As far as I know, I've never been � I'm not aware

19   of anything.

20       Q     All right.  You talked about reconstituted

21   tobacco, right?

22       A     Yes.

23       Q     And you even showed a video of � of the

24   manufacturing process that showed some � that showed the

25   recon procedures, right?

1       A     That's right.

2       Q     Now, I want to put this in the context.

3   Reconstituted tobacco only makes up, depending on the brand

4   and the year, 10 to 30 percent of the tobacco blend in

5   commercially sold cigarettes?

6       A     Yeah.  And there are blends -- there are brands

7   that don't contain any recon.

8       Q     And you were not asked, for this case, to take a

9   list of cigarette brands that Mr. Price smoked and the years

10   he smoked them and to try to analyze them individually for

11   the amount of reconstituted tobacco that was used in those

12   brands in those years, did you?

13       A     No, I was not.

14       Q     The reconstituted tobacco process actually removes

15   nicotine in the sense that what goes back onto the sheet at

16   the end of the process has less nicotine than what comes

17   off; is that true?

18       A     Well, it removes all the nicotine.  And then they

19   reapply it.  So the decision to reapply it and to what

20   levels is -- is really up to the manufacturer.  And as I �

21   I think I mentioned to the jury, some -- in that process,

22   nicotine � some of it will dissipate in the air.

23             So if you take out nicotine, extract it and only

24   use the extracted nicotine to reapply back on the sheet,

25   you'll end up with less nicotine than you started with.

1       Q     Okay.  And this reconstituted tobacco process,

2   that was actual � we won't take the time to show it, but

3   you'll agree with me that that was written up in the

4   Reader's Digest way back in 1957.

5       A     Yes.  I -- I would agree that it's been

6   mentioned -- I think it was first commercialized in Camel in

7   1950, and the patents for recon tobacco go back -- go back a

8   few decades before that.

9       Q     The Surgeon General has commented and reviewed

10   information relating to reconstituted tobacco sheet over the

11   years, right?

12       A     They have.

13       Q     And one of the things that the Surgeon General's

14   Report said about reconstituted tobacco is that

15   reconstituted tobacco sheet in animal experiments had less

16   biological activity than other smoke, right?

17       A     Based on the experiments that were cited, I think

18   you're talking about the '81 Surgeon General Report.

19       Q     I am.

20       A     And I'm familiar with those experiments that are

21   mentioned there.  And so it depends on what � what � you

22   know, what the recon is made out of it and how much it will

23   cause or not cause tumors.

24             But in those experiments with the recon that they

25   tested and reported on, you're � you're absolutely correct.

1   They were less carcinogenic in animal mouse painting

2   experiments than natural tobacco.

3       Q     Less carcinogenic means a lower propensity to

4   cause cancer.

5       A     In animals, yes, mouse painting experiments, which

6   was the way of defining a carcinogen.

7       Q     All right.  You are familiar with the meeting

8   minutes from May 5th, 1976, where the National Cancer

9   Institute was looking at different ways to potentially

10   create a less hazardous cigarette?

11       A     Well, I'm familiar with the Tobacco Working Group,

12   and I think these are minutes from that.  And I believe the

13   industry was approached to supply, you know, cigarettes

14   and � and cigarettes with different amounts of recon and

15   different methods for producing the recon that could be

16   tested in experiments that were being done by academic

17   researchers at that time as part of the Tobacco Working

18   Group.

19       Q     Let's take a look at that document.

20             MR. WALKER:  Can we pull that up, please?

21       Q     National Cancer Institute, smoking and health

22   program, high nicotine/tar, low-tar cigarettes, minutes of

23   meeting, May 5th, 1976.  And I want to turn to � what

24   page is it?

	All right.  "Feasibility and desirability."

2
	Do you see that?                                   ij

3
	A     Yes.                                                 ;

4
	Q     And it says:  "It was the consensus of the group

5
	that an effort to produce and test cigarettes with

6
	tar/nicotine ratios of less than 10 is valuable and should

7
	be conducted.  In view of the manipulatory potential of

8
	reconstituted sheet technology, such cigarettes are

9
	feasible."

10
	Do you see that?                                   \

	Q     All right.  So that's the National Cancer

13
	Institute, talking about one way that you might manipulate

14
	nicotine to get a less hazardous cigarette is to use

15
	reconstituted tobacco, right?

	Q     All right.  You talked in your direct examination

1   was the pivotal issue discussed at the meeting.  Nicotine

2   has the greatest pharmacologic activity when it is in the

3   freebase form.  The base form is also the 'distillable'

4   form, which readily transfers to cigarette smoke."

5             This is similar to what you were describing in

6   your direct examination � right? � about pH levels in

7   nicotine.

8       A     Sure.  Actually, I think it was R. J. Reynolds

9   describing it.

10       Q     "It was suggested that the form of the nicotine

11   could be critical (a) in an efficiency of transfer to smoke

12   as base nicotine with minimal transformation to 'tar' and

13    (b) physiological impact which depends on the base

14   salt/nicotine ratio in the smoke aerosol."

15             Did I read that right?

16       A     You did.

17       Q     Again, this isn't an internal secret tobacco

18   company document, is it?

19        A     No.  This is minutes from the Tobacco Working 2 0        Group.

21       Q     All right.  And one of the theories that they were

22   looking at as part of this search for a less hazardous

23   cigarette was that if you could convert the nicotine from

24   its bound form in the particle phase, you could get it in

25   the gas phase or free form.  This is what they're talking

1   about.  You could deliver the nicotine to the smoker without

2   dragging the tar that causes cancer; is that right?

3       A     Well, that's what they're talking about, but

4   almost all the nicotine is transferred in the particulate

5   form, and really that form, if it has a higher gauge, you

6   get more absorption of that nicotine, not just dashes of

7   nicotine.

8       Q     Essentially, what they're talking about is using

9   what -- what was � is using this information about the pH

10   of smoke and nicotine to try to come up with a less

11   hazardous cigarette, right?

12       A     That was the purpose of the Tobacco Working

13   Group.

14       Q     All right.  On this issue of pH, you have seen

15   the document from 1996 that's authored by Leslie Lewis

16   at R. J. Reynolds?

17       A     Yes, I have.

18       Q     Okay.  And �

19             MR. WALKER:  Can I have the ELMO, just for a

20       moment, please?

21       Q     The author is Leslie Lewis �

22             MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection, Your Honor.  May we

23       approach?

1   of the jury as follows:)

2             MR. PRYSOCK:  Your Honor, this is a document that

3       was used for litigation -- this was during the State of

4       Minnesota � when they sued the tobacco industry.  What

5       happened was RJR's law firm � the law firms went back,

6       and they actually invalidated a report from

7       1970-something.  They had it declared invalid while the

8       litigation was going on.

9             So in � for purposes of that litigation, so I'm

10       just alerting counsel that if they're going to use this

11       document, I'm going to have Dr. Cummings explain that

12       this was during the ongoing State of Minnesota

13       litigation and what � what the real story is behind

14       this.  They can't use this document and then not allow

15       us to explain that.

16             THE COURT:  What is the document?

17             MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, if I might, they showed

18       the jury an internal document from 1973 suggesting that

19       the companies were trying to manipulate the pH levels in

20       smoke to increase sales.

21             THE COURT:  Uh-huh.

22             MR. WALKER:  It was basically a hypothesis that if

23        you change the pH, maybe that will increase sales. 2 4                                 THE COURT:  Uh-huh.

25                                 MR. WALKER:  In 1996, Leslie Lewis, who isn't � I

Page 2499 don't think Mr. Prysock meant to suggest this.  He was a

scientist at R. J. Reynolds.  He wasn't outside of the

company.  He actually went back and tested the

hypothesis that was in the document that they showed

from 1973.  And he tracked, in the pack, the pH levels

of various brands over time, starting in the '70s and

moving forward, and he tracked the market shares of

those products.  And he basically showed that that

hypothesis over time was proved to be incorrect.

And I've asked Dr. Cummings about this before. I � every document that they've shown was also used in litigation, so I'm not really � I am not sure what the point of that is.

But what you see when you look at this document is that the pH levels that -- that they said, in 1973, the companies wanted to manipulate and drive up are actually going down.  The entire period after 1973, they're going down.

And so this is responsive to � to that.  I don't know about invalidation.  This doesn't say anything about evaluating a report.  I'm not sure what opinion he wants to elicit.  I don't think it's been disclosed.

THE COURT:  What would �

legal and regulatory responses.  It says it right there

on the document.  I don't have any problem with him

pointing that out.

I'm not sure if the suggestion is that he � there's some need to describe Minnesota litigation.  I'm not sure that I follow that.  It says right on the document, it was done for legal and regulatory responses.

MR. PRYSOCK:  We have other documents that discuss why or who asked this person to go back and do that. And it was legal counsel who told them, go back and do this as a result of the pending litigation.  Now, we want you to go back and look at the study and prove it didn't work.  I'm just telling you �

THE COURT:  I'm not going to have it.

MR. PRYSOCK:  And this � this notion that we didn't disclose it in his --

THE COURT:  I'm not -- I'm not having a problem with that.  I --

MR. PRYSOCK:  So the timing of this was the Minnesota litigation was pending.  That document that we produced from 1973, when there was no litigation pending, would � was � was in play in that Minnesota litigation.

1              MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor, I will.

2              (The sidebar conference was concluded and the

3   following proceedings were held in open court in the

4   presence of the jury:)

5   BY MR. WALKER:

6        Q     All right.  Is this still on your � is your

7   screen working?

8        A     Yes.

9        Q     Okay.  So we were looking at this document.

10   Leslie Lewis was a scientist at Reynolds, right?

11        A     Yes.

12        Q     And in 1996, he's essentially looking at � he's

13   reviewing internal reports regarding cigarette smoke pH and

14   sales trends, right?

15        A     Correct.

16        Q     Now, in your direct examination testimony, you

17   showed a document from 1973 that was written by Claude

18   Teague, right?

19        A     Correct.

20        Q     And in that document, Claude Teague is essentially

21   looking at popular brands of the day, right?

22        A     Right.  He looked at some of the Reynolds brands

23    as well as their competitors, and they looked at the smoke 2 4        pH.

25       Q     And he's trying to � he's looking at -- to see if

1   there's a correlation between smoke pH and essentially sales

2   or the popularity --

3       A     They did.

4       Q     --of the brand.

5       A     They found a correlation, a positive correlation,

6   in that time period, in the '60s and early '70s, when they

7   did that report.  And that's what they were talking about in

8   that time period.

9       Q     Okay.  And when you showed that document, you

10   suggested -- and correct me if I'm wrong � you suggested to

11   the jury that there was an interest or an effort at

12   R. J. Reynolds to then alter the pH level of smoke to try --

13   to increase it, to increase sales, right?

14       A     Well, they had many methods.  I think there were

15   seven methods that Dr. Teague talked about in his memo for

16   altering smoke pH.  And some of the methods, their

17   competitors had used.  I think they were talking

18   specifically about Philip Morris.  And some of that � those

19   methods, like the ammoniation, were later adopted, well, in

20   the next year for Camel cigarettes and then in 1979 with

21   Winston, adding ammoniation or diammonium phosphate to the

22   reconstituted tobacco.

23       Q     Thank you for that.

24             I want to be clear.  The suggestion you were

25   making by using that document is that Reynolds was

1   interested in increasing the pH of smoke over time with the

2   idea that that would increase the sales of their cigarette

3   products, right?

4        A     That was � yes.  That was not my statement.

5   That's what the document says.

6        Q     This document by Leslie Lewis looks back over the

7   time period from 1973 of the Teague document that you showed

8   up through the 1990s, right?

9        A     Right.  It's after that time period.  So they're

10   looking � picking up from '73 onward, where they don't

11   really see a correlation because, in fact, all the companies

12   pretty much had followed the methods that had been developed

13   in the '60s by Philip Morris and Brown & Williamson, also

14   American Tobacco, with the ammoniation.  And so you don't

15   see much of a correlation afterwards because there's

16   not that differentiation between the brands in the

17   ammoniation process.

18        Q     You've gotten way ahead of me.  Okay?  What I'm --

19   what I'm asking you is from the time period of the 1973 memo

20   until this 1996 document, what Leslie Lewis is doing is he's

21   charting what happened -- what actually happened with pH

22   levels in the smoke of different brands over that time

23   period, right?

24        A     Yes, he is.

25                 Q           And  he's   also   charting  what   happened  with  the

2
	A
	Correct.

3
	Q
	Okay.  And it says that at the top of this

4
	document,
	he's in the product development department,

	right?
	

6
	A
	That's right.

	And the program, it says "247/legal and regulatory \

	A
	Right.

10

	Okay.  In the back of this document � I won't go

11
	through i
	t all.  I just want to show you for the Reynolds

13
	
	All right.  Let's see, the line � so they've

14
	different

15
	A
	That's right.

	Q
	And the line that has the little sguare is market

17
	share.
	

18
	A
	Correct.

	Q
	And the line that has the � I guess that's a

	diamond.
	

21
	A
	Correct.

22
	Q
	Is the smoke pH, right?

23
	A
	That's right.

24
	Q
	Okay.  And so the -- the memo that you showed from ji

	Claude Teague was in 1973, right?

	A     Correct.                                           ij

2
	Q     And he was talking -- he was basically talking

3
	about there -- there was a possibility of getting some

4
	increased market share as you -- if you rose the smoke pH

5
	over six, right?

6
	A    Well, what they -- what he talked about was that

7
	there was a correlation between -- a positive correlation

8
	between the smoke pH above six, slightly above six, not too

9
	high but slightly above six, and sales.  And that was

10
	particularly true for popular brands, I think, Marlboro,

11
	Kool.  They looked at Winston and a couple of other brands,

12
	I believe.

13
	Q     Winston, Marlboro � I'll just ask you about

14
	Winston, Marlboro �

15
	A     Sure.                                              \

16
	Q     -- and Kool.

17
	So on the left side here, they've got the smoke

18
	pH, right?

19
	A     Yeah.                                              ;

20
	Q     And this is where it starts in 1973, at the time

21
	of that that document that you showed.  It's already at

22
	somewhere between 6.1 and 6.2.

23
	A     That's right.

24
	Q     Right?

25

1       Q     And then the chart shows -- I'll let the jury

2   decide for themselves.  The chart then shows whether the pH

3   then goes up or goes down or moves around to these different

4   points, right?

5       A     Sure.

6       Q     And then this line at the top, that's showing the

7   market share, and you can see whether market share after

8   1973 went up, went down or remained steady, right?

9       A     That's right.  Of course, they need to note that

10   this is also for the multi-port filter, so that's important

11   because that alters the smoke pH.  It's a unigue filter.

12       Q     How about this one for Salem?

13       A     Sure.

14       Q     1973, right?

15       A     Yeah.

16       Q     Smoke pH starts off -- at the time of the Teague

17   document, it's already right around 6.2, right?

18       A     That's right.

19       Q     And using the information in � in this

20   document, you can see whether or not smoke pH was

21   increased over the years after that memo, whether it was

22   decreased or whether it moved around over time and

23   ultimately went down, right?

24       A     Sure, yes.

1
	
	All right.  Let's see.  Let's look at Vantage.

2
	That was on your list of cigarettes that Mr. Price smoked
	
3
	at some
	point, right?

4
	A
	Yes, it was.                                       ji

	Q
	And in this one, the pH line is this one, right?

6
	A
	Uh-huh.

7
	Q
	And let's see.  This one starts in 1977, which is

8
	a few years after the Teague document, and it takes a dive
	
9
	and levels out below six, right?
	
10
	A
	That's right.

11
	Q
	Just one moment.

12
	
	All right.  Now, let's look at one last one.

13
	A
	Okay.                                              ;

14
	Q
	This is the one for Kool cigarettes, right?

15
	A
	Okay.                                              \

16
	Q
	Now, I asked you to assume earlier that

17
	Mr. Price's testimony is that he smoked Kool from 1952 to
	
18
	1954.  Do you remember that?
	
19
	A
	Yes.                                               I

20
	Q
	So all of the � if that's true, all of this data

21
	on this
	chart would be about 20 years after he stopped

22
	smoking
	Kool, right?

23
	A
	Yes.                                               ;

	pH would increase market share, the pH line is this

1   one with the sguares, right?

2       A     No.  That's market share.

3       Q     Oh, you're right.  The pH is the one with the

4   diamonds.

5       A     That's correct.

6       Q     And so from 1973, it's at 6.6 or so.  The very

7   next year, it drops, right?

8       A     That's correct.

9       Q     Remains steady for a year or two, goes back up.

10       A     Right.

11       Q     Drops down to � down to right about six?

12       A     Correct.

13       Q     And then levels out, right?

14       A     Correct.

15       Q     But over that entire time period, regardless of

16   whether the pH was going down or the pH was going up, the

17   market share was steadily declining; is that right?

18       A     That's true.

19       Q     Okay.  This data about what was happening with the

20   pH level in smoke in some of these brands that we've been

21   talking about, we didn't see a document showing pH level �

22   what actually happened after the 1990 -- 1973 � boy, I got

23   all tongue-tied there.  Let me start over.

24             In your direct examination, after you showed the

1   examination, did we see a document that showed what happened

2   to pH levels after that over time?

3        A     No.  I think I had mentioned the addition of

4   ammoniation but we didn't show a document.  I'd be happy to

5   show you the '83 document on Winston, if you'd like.

6        Q     During your direct examination, after you showed

7   the 1973 document --

8        A     Uh-huh.

9        Q     -- talking about this issue --

10        A     Yeah.

11        Q     -- did we see � did you -- did we see in your

12   direct examination, a document that charted the market share

13   of Winston cigarettes after that time?

14        A     I think we did.  The Burrows document actually

15   includes market share data, as I'm recalling, up to 1984

16   for Winston cigarettes.  We didn't show the chart but it is

17   in that document.  I'm just recalling off the top of my

18   head.

19              And there were some other documents that

20   were presented as well, primarily in regards to youth

21   update of smoking, but also a report on market share for

22   Winston.

23                 Q           This   is   the   only   document   that   we've   seen   so   far

24        that   actually   looks   at   what   was   happening  to  pH   levels   of

25        smoke   and market   share   and  charts   it   year  by  year   after  the

1   1973 Teague document that we saw in your direct examination;

2   is that right?

3       A     That is true.

4       Q     As you pointed out, before I even got to it,

5   whether we're looking at Kool cigarettes or Winston

6   cigarettes or � I think Salem was the other one that we

7   looked at, there is no upward -- consistent upward trend of

8   pH levels in smoke, is there?

9       A     No.  There's a -- actually a fairly consistent

10   downward trend, which relates to the addition of changes in

11   the filter, particularly filter bending.

12       Q     And there's no --

13       A     Which is one of the methods to manipulate pH.

14       Q     And there's no correlation between the trend of

15   the pH levels in the smoke of these brands and the market

16   share?

17       A     Well, I mean, you could say the trend, but it's

18   in the opposite direction of what Dr. Teague had talked

19   about in � from the '60s and early '70s because there

20   definitely was a positive relationship.  But that

21   relationship was null to negative actually after 1973, as

22   you've pointed out.

23       Q     Let me just cut to the chase, Dr. Cummings.  Isn't

24   it true that all commercial cigarettes, cigarettes with

25   filters, cigarettes without filters, they're all � they �

Page 2513 they all can cause cancer?

A     If you smoke enough of them.

Q    Menthol cigarettes can cause cancer?

A     Again, if you smoke enough of them.  It's all dependent on the dose.

Q    Cigarettes with additives with can cause cancer, and cigarettes with no additives can cause cancer.

A     That's true.

Q     All commercial cigarettes sold in the United States are addictive �

A     No, that's not �

Q     � to your way of thinking.

A     That's not been true.  Historically, there have been some brands that have been introduced over time that had very low levels of nicotine and there are studies � studies I've done and others have done have shown that when you get below a certain level of nicotine, it has a very low of use liability and will not sustain smoking.

And, of course, with other cigarettes out on the market, people go to the other � go back to the other cigarettes.

But it's not true that all commercial brands have -- contained, you know, high levels of nicotine

or

Q          You're   saying  that   at   different   points   in

1   time, there have been cigarettes with lower levels of

2   nicotine �

3        A     Yeah.

4        Q     -- cigarettes that are more traditional,

5   conventional cigarettes with higher levels of nicotine,

6   right?

7        A     That's right.

8        Q     And consumers, over the years, have shown a

9   preference for the cigarettes that are more traditional,

10   conventional cigarettes, right?

11        A     Yeah.  I think that smokers will stay with a

12   product that beats the nicotine addiction.

13        Q     Whether they are filtered or unfiltered, all

14   commercial cigarettes available in the United States can be

15   addictive.

16        A     No.  Again, there are these very low nicotine

17   cigarettes.  There's technology that's existed -- existed

18    for decades that has been commercialized.  So that would be

19   a no.

20        Q     Any indication in the information you were

21   provided that Mr. Price even once tried whatever cigarettes

22   you're talking about that you have in mind that you say are

23   not addictive?

24        A     No, sir.

25                 Q           Cigarettes   with  additives   and  cigarettes   without

1   additives can be addictive, right?

2       A     Yes, as long as they have nicotine in them and

3   sufficient amounts of nicotine that can be extracted.

4       Q     None of the cigarettes that were commercially

5   available on the market during Mr. Price's lifetime was any

6   safer than the others.

7       A    Well, I would disagree with that because the

8   cigarettes that I'm familiar with that had very low levels

9   of nicotine in the studies that we've done, people will stop

10   smoking them.

11       Q     What's the name �

12       A     And so, therefore, it will be a safer cigarette

13   because it will allow them to freely choose to stop smoking,

14   as most smokers would do.

15       Q    What's the brand of the name of the cigarettes

16   you're talking about?

17       A     Well, Quest was a brand that Liggett &

18   Myers marketed.  There was an earlier version called

19   "Next" that was test-marketed in three cities in the U.S.

20   in the late '80s, using a different methodology for

21   lowering nicotine.  There's a product called "Spectrum"

22   today and a product sold overseas, which is the Spectrum

23       product   �

24                 Q           I   don't   want   to   ask  you,   Doctor   �

25                 A           --   called  Athic    [phonetic],   a  type   of   cigarette

2
	Q     -- about what's sold overseas.                    \

3
	Can � can Quest cigarettes cause cancer?

4
	A     If you smoke enough of them.

5
	Q     Can they cause emphysema?                          \

6
	A     Again, it's all dependent on smoking enough of

7
	them.

	Q     What was the other one you said?                   I

11
	A     Yeah.  And they also were sold under � in the     ij

12
	test markets, Merit DeNic and I think Benson & Hedges

13
	DeNic.

14
	Q     If you took any one of the cigarette products that ji

15
	you were provided the list about that Mr. Price smoked and

16
	you took the filtered cigarettes and made them unfiltered

17
	but you left everything else the same, they'd still be

18
	addictive; they could still probably � still potentially

19
	cause emphysema, right?

20
	A     As long as they have enough nicotine in them.

17       people hearing different things.

THE COURT:  Did he take me at my word to get here at a quarter of 3:00?

THE BAILIFF:  I told them when we went outside before we even left.  I said, you know he don't mean at that literally.  He just said that.  He mean to 2:00.

16            A JUROR:  We told Mr. Lawrence.

21                                        CROSS EXAMINATION (Cont'd) 2 2   BY MR. WALKER:

23       Q    Hello again, Dr. Cummings.

24       A    Good afternoon.

25       Q    Let's see.  Just finishing up on the pH of

1   smoke issue.  One more question.

2            Would you agree with me that a high pH is one

3   reason why cigars are hard to inhale?

4       A    Yes.  Large cigars � not the small ones, but

5   the large cigars tend to have a pH above 8.  And when

6   you get too high or you get too low on the pH scale, it

7   affects inhalability.  So that's why large cigars tend

8   to � the smoke tends to be held mainly in the mouth.

9       Q    All right.  We talked earlier a little bit

10   about Claude Teague.  I want to ask you about a

11   different Reynolds scientist that � who's name showed

12   up in some of the documents we've seen, and that's

13   Dr. Alan Rodgman.  Okay?

14       A    Sure.

15       Q    Reynolds hired Allen Rodgman as an analytic

16   chemist in 1954?

17       A    Right.  In the summer of '54, I believe.

18       Q    And you showed at least one document, maybe

19   more, that were written by Dr. Rodgman back in the '50s,

20   I think?

21       A    Correct.

22       Q    You agree that Dr. Rodgman was a good chemist

23   and a good scientist, right?

24       A    Yes.  He was an analytic chemist, and he was

25   quite talented.  He developed some of the technology at

1   the time, gas chromatography, that was used in isolating

2   different chemicals from tobacco smoke.

3       Q    And you would agree that Dr. Rodgman at

4   Reynolds helped to advance the science in terms of

5   identifying the constituents of smoke?

6       A    Yes.  Through the method I just mentioned �

7       Q    Right.

8       A    � the development of this gas chromatography.

9       Q    Would you agree that scientists at Reynolds

10   actually discovered over half of the compounds that have

11   been found in cigarette smoke?

12       A    You know, I don't know.  I've seen his book,

13   and Dr. Perfetti, who I think did the � did the updated

14   edition after Dr. Rodgman passed away, where they made

15   that claim.  So I don't dispute it.  I mean, Reynolds

16   did focus, particularly in that early period with

17   Dr. Rodgman, in identifying many of the chemical

18   constituents in cigarette smoke.

19       Q    And Dr. Rodgman over the years, for example,

20   gave speeches about what was in cigarette smoke, right?

21       A    Not many public ones, but he did � I think

22   I've been shown a 1968 talk that he gave to the American

23   Chemistry Society.

24       Q    That was the one I was going to ask you about.

25            MR. WALKER:  Can we pull that up, please.

1   some of the results of research conducted on the

2   composition of tobacco smoke.

3            Right?

4       A    That's right.

5            MR. WALKER:  And if we could go to the next

6       page.

7   BY MR. WALKER:

8       Q    During the past two decades, the number of

9   identified components in tobacco smoke has increased at

10   a tremendous rate because of the efforts of research

11   personnel both within and outside of the tobacco

12   industry.

13            Right?

14       A    Yes.

15       Q    And then during his presentation, perhaps

16   because it was being given to the chemical society, he

17   actually drew pictures of some of the compounds that had

18   been identified in smoke?

19       A    That's right.

2 0                           MR. WALKER:  Can we show an example of that?

21   BY MR. WALKER:

22       Q    And this is � I'm no chemist, but these are

23   drawings of some of the chemical compounds, in this case

24   pentacyclic hydrocarbons found in tobacco smoke, right?

25       A    Yeah.  That's a class of hydrocarbons, and

1   benzo(a)pyrene is highlighted there.

2       Q    All right.

3            MR. WALKER:  Can you zoom on that for a second?

4       Can you zoom in on the second line, the far one

5       right there, you see it says cholanthrene?

6            Okay.  Thank you.

7   BY MR. WALKER:

8       Q    That's one of the compounds that I think you

9   mentioned in one of the earlier documents that you

10   showed, right?

11       A    Yes.  The 1959 one where Reynolds had

12   identified that particular chemical constituent,

13   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.  But that was one that

14   had not yet been presented in the scientific literature,

15   I think is what is mentioned in that 1959 memo to Ken

16   Hoover, the director of R&D.

17       Q    Certainly by this time Dr. Rodgman is actually

18   giving a speech about it, right?

19       A    Yeah.  A decade later, yeah.  That's true.

20            MR. WALKER:  All right.  You can take that

21       down.

2 2       BY MR. WALKER:

23       Q    I want to talk now about some of the other

24   organizations that you mentioned.

1   Committee, right?

2       A    That's right.

3        Q    You said it later became the Council For

4   Tobacco Research?

5       A    Yeah.  Same organization.  They just changed

6   their name in March of 1964.

7        Q    And this was the organization that you talked

8   about in terms of funding research, and it was

9   announced -- the formation of it was announced in The

10   Frank Statement, right?

11       A    Correct.

12        Q    You would agree that a great -- a lot of the

13   TIRC- or CTR-funded research was excellent, right?

14       A    Yes.

15        Q    TIRC and CTR funded top scientists from around

16   the country, right?

17       A    They did.  They funded scientists here at

18   universities in Florida.  I think over the years they

19   funded, you know, some of the top scientists in the �

20   in the world � ten Nobel Prize winners -- although

21   their research, when you look at what they did, had

22   nothing to do with studying the relationship between

23   smoking and disease, which reflected the fact that much

24   of that research that was funded was excellent research

25   but just didn't have to do with what they told the

1   Department of Justice in 1954 they would be doing.

2        Q    Let me try to catch up with � you said a lot

3   there.

4             You mentioned, I think, that some of the

5   scientists who received CTR funding went on to be

6   awarded the Nobel Prize?

7       A    Yeah.  I think there was ten of them.

8        Q    These are the ten that you were just referring f

9   to, right?

10       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

11        Q    Okay.  And I think you also said that CTR

12   funded grants to researchers at research institutes all

13   over the United States, all over the world, right?

14       A    That is true.

15        Q    Including individuals in institutions here in

16   Florida, you mentioned, right?

17       A    That's right.

18             MR. WALKER:  Can we pull up the demonstrative.

19   BY MR. WALKER:

20        Q    Including all of these institutions, they all

21   received research funds or research grants from CTR or

22        TIRC,    right?

23                  A         Yes,   over   that   45-year   history.

24                  Q         All   in   all,   TIRC/CTR   funded  about   a   half   a

25        billion   dollars   in   research;   is   that   right?

1       A    I would say that's about right.

2       Q    And most of the articles that resulted from

3   TIRC- or-CTR-funded research were published in

4   peer-reviewed journals, right?

5       A    True.  About 6,000 of them, as I recall.

6       Q    Now, you � you said that some or many or � I

7   forget what adjective you used.  You said many of the

8   articles that were the result of TIRC- or CTR-funded

9   research, according to you, didn't have anything to do

10   with smoking and health?

11       A    Yeah.  There's two sources for that.  I would

12   be happy to explain the basis for it.

13       Q    Well, let me ask you for now:  Can you agree

14   that, over the years, the Surgeon General reports on

15   smoking and health have actually cited somewhere between

16   6- and 700 articles that were the result of CTR-funded

17   research?

18       A    Yes.  That was one source.  600 out of 6,000 is

19   about 10 percent, and about 10 percent of the research 2 0       actually did have to do with smoking and health;

21   90 percent did not.

22       Q    And you would agree that CTR, through the

23   scientific advisory board, funded research products �

24   research projects that actually produced results that

25   were inconsistent with or contrary to the positions the

	right?

3
	A
	Some of it did, yes.  Absolutely.

4
	Q
	All right.  I want to get back to Reynolds.

5
	
	You're familiar with design issues.  You're

6
	familiar
	with something that Reynolds made called

7
	Premier?

9
	Q
	Before I ask you about Premier, let's get the

10
	basics.
	

11
	
	A traditional cigarette burns tobacco when it's

12
	lit, right?
	
13
	A
	That's right.

14
	Q
	And the tar and the nicotine that we talked

15
	about that the jury has heard about, that's created when ij
	
16
	tobacco
	is burned?

17
	A
	Tobacco or the fake man-made tobacco they put

18
	in.
	

19
	Q
	The bad compounds, like the ones that were

20
	referenced in Dr. Rodgman's speech, those come from the
	
21
	incomple
	te combustion of organic material, not just

22
	tobacco,
	right?

23
	A
	That's true.  And also the pesticides and so on l

24
	that are
	sprayed on the tobacco leaves.

25
	Q
	All right.  By farmers?

1       A    By the farmers.  There's also the additives

2   that are put on, and many of those additives, which are

3   safe as general additives for food, but when you burn

4   those additives, they generate some toxic chemicals.

5       Q    And we talked about the additives earlier when

6   we were talking about the Department of Health and � is

7   it HH?

8       A    Health and Human Services.

9       Q    Health and Human Services.  Thank you.

10       A    Yeah.                                                                                                f

11       Q    So this Premier product that I want to ask you

12   about, that was a product that heated tobacco instead of |

13   burning it, right?

14       A    Yes, that is true.

15       Q    That's a product that was marketed by Reynolds

16   beginning in 1988, true?

17       A    In two test markets, St. Louis and Tucson,

18   Arizona.

19       Q    And until Reynolds did it, no one had actually

20   tried to commercially market a cigarette like Premier

21   that heated tobacco instead of burning it?

22       A    To my knowledge, that's correct.

23       Q    And certainly at the time that the Premier

24   cigarette was marketed by Reynolds, there were

25   scientists who believed that tobacco-heating products as

1   opposed to burning were safer than tobacco-burning

2   cigarettes, right?

3       A    Yes.  I mean, essentially, if you could

4   separate nicotine from the tar, you would have a safer

5   product.

6       Q    And that was one of the goals of the Premier

7   cigarette was to find a product that would reduce the

8   carcinogens in cigarette smoke, right?

9       A    Well, actually the stated goal, I mean in terms

10   of their advertising, was you got a cleaner smoke.  I

11   think at the time they were talking about in your house.

12   I remember the ads for it that talked about you didn't

13   get the � the windows and the curtains stained.

14       Q    Well, what I'm really asking about right now

15   are the design objectives.

16            One of the goals of the Premier cigarette was

17   to come up with a product that would reduce carcinogens

18   in cigarette smoke, right?

19       A    Well, that was one of the � the things they

20   talked about in their monograph that they published.

21       Q    And you've testified before that Premier

22   cigarette, this idea of heating tobacco instead of

23   burning it, that was a good idea?

24       A    Yes, I have said that.  There are some defects

25   in Premier that I could talk about, but the general idea

1   of separating nicotine delivery from tar is a good one.

2       Q    All right.  And later, after the Premier

3   cigarette, Reynolds developed a cigarette called

4   Eclipse?

5       A    Yeah.  I called it Son of Premier.  I actually

6   wrote an article of that title.

7       Q    Son of Premier?

8       A    Yeah, Son of Premier, because it's the next

9   generation.

10            Now, that did burn a little bit of tobacco

11   because they found one of the problems with Premier,

12   besides the fiberglass that was used in the carbon heat

13   source at the other end of the product, didn't light up

14   so easily.  So they impregnated the carbon with tobacco

15   and also imparted a little bit of taste.  Because in

16   Premier you just had the metal tube with the

17   glycerine-laced nicotine beads that were inside, and

18   that created the nicotine vapor.  And with Eclipse, they

19   used recon tobacco with precise dosing of nicotine, and

20   when you heated the carbon heat source, you got a little

21   bit of taste but a lot � you got some higher levels of

22   these other chemicals as a result.

23            But it was the next generation.  It came out

24   about six, seven years after Premier.

25       Q    So the son of Premier, as you called it, the

1   Eclipse cigarette, if you looked at the constituents of

2   the smoke from the Eclipse cigarette, it delivered

3   vastly lower quantities of smoke constituents,

4   especially the harmful ones, than conventional

5   cigarettes, right?

6       A    Yeah.  Conventional cigarettes, that's true.

7   But actually higher levels of the toxins compared to the

8   original Premier.

9       Q    And the research that was done about the

10   Premier cigarettes and the constituents of its smoke,

11   the studies of the constituents of Eclipse smoke, that

12   research was published by Reynolds in books, right?

13       A    The Premier was published as a monograph that,

14   you know, you could write and get.  I have a copy of it.

15       Q    The jury's heard that term before, monograph.

16   Basically a big book, right?

17       A    Yeah.

18       Q    And �

19       A    That was true for Premier but not for Eclipse.

20   Eclipse, most of the stuff was found in patents.  That's

21   why when I wrote the article, it was a review of the

22   patents.  And, of course, they were actually

23   test-marketing Eclipse, although it didn't have that

24   name, in Buffalo, which is how I learned about it � 2 5       Q    Right.

1       A    � and then Reynolds learned of our research on

2   their product and invited us � or invited me and one

3   other scientist to meet with them at Reynolds because,

4   you know, of my knowledge of cigarette design and work

5   in that field.

6       Q    Bottom line, you believe that both the Premier

7   and the Eclipse cigarettes are safer compared to

8   conventional burning cigarettes?

9       A    Absolutely.  Conventional cigarettes kill one

10   out of two long-term users.  These would be certainly

11   advances beyond that.

12       Q    All right.  We talked early � we've been

13   talking about some of these different figures from your

14   testimony � Claude Teague, Alan Rodgman.  I want to ask

15   you a few more questions about some of those people.

16            Let's start with Claude Teague.

17             He's no longer at Reynolds?

18       A    True.  He's deceased.

19       Q    He's passed away? 2 0       A    Uh-huh.

21       Q    Alan Rodgman.  We were just talking about him.

22   He's no longer at Reynolds?

23       A    That's true.  He retired from Reynolds about a

24   decade and a half ago and then recently passed away.

25       Q    Okay.  What about James Johnston, the jury saw

1   in the congressional testimony?  He's no longer at

2   Reynolds, is he?

3       A    Yeah.  When he testified, shortly after, he

4   left R. J. Reynolds.  He went to Krispy Kreme, I

5   believe.

6       Q    Why did you bring up Krispy Kreme?  You put

7   that in my head.

8       A    They've got good donuts.  Not so good for you,

9   though.

10       Q    All right.  Let's see.  The jury � I think one

11   of the documents that you showed had a reference to

12   Robert Heimann.  At one point in time he was the

13   president of the American Tobacco Company, right?

14       A    That is true.

15       Q    And he's not associated with any tobacco

16   company now?

17       A    No.  He � I think at the time he gave a

18   deposition in '86 he was retired.  Former chief

19   executive of American Tobacco, and he had retired in the

20   early '80s.  I think 1980 or '81, as I recall.  And he

21   has now passed away as well.

22       Q    All right.  The CTR that I was just asking you

23   questions about, that no longer exists?

24       A    Out of business in 1998.  Shut their doors.

1       Q    TI, the Tobacco Institute that I asked you

2   about in connection with some of those polls that we

3   looked at, no longer exists?

4       A    Out of business in 1998.

5       Q    Okay.  All right.  I want to follow up with

6   you.  You talked � when you were providing your

7   qualifications, you talked about some of the work that

8   you've done over the years.  I want to follow up with

9   you about the work that you did in your smoking clinic

10   at Roswell Park.

11       A    Sure.

12       Q    It's � it's correct, isn't it, that you never

13   told anyone who came to your smoking clinic at Roswell

14   Park that it would be impossible for them to quit, have

15   you?

16       A    That is true.

17       Q    When cigarette smokers came to your clinic

18   there, you told them that the success rate for quitting,

19   for people who really want to quit and stick with it, is

20   100 percent, right?

21       A    Yes.  Trying to motivate them and also, you

22   know, tell them, you know, that they're going to have to

23   be persistent in doing it.

24       Q    You've testified in the past that anyone can

25   quit smoking if they make their mind up to do it, right?

1       A    True.  Make a quit attempt.  Whether they are

2   successful in staying off, abstaining, in the long term,

3   I have testified many times, because of my experience,

4   is some people do literally smoke themselves into a

5   grave and cannot quit.

6       Q    All right.  And you understand that Mr. �

7            Well, let me � let me ask you:  You testified

8   about a brochure.  I think it was called "Smart Move"?

9       A    Yes.  That's the brochure I wrote for the

10   Cancer Society in 1987, I believe it was.

11       Q    All right.  Before I ask you about that one, I

12   want to ask you about a different one called "Clearing

13   the Air."  You're familiar with that one from the

14   National Cancer Institute, right?

15       A    Yes.

16       Q    All right.  And the United States Department of

17   Health and Human Services that we talked about earlier,

18   they're charged with providing information to the public

19   about smoking and other subjects, right?

20       A    Yes, they are.

21       Q    I want to pull up that "You Can Quit Smoking"

22   guide that we were just talking about.

23             It's from June of 2000, right?

It says there:

Studies suggest that everyone can quit smoking.

Do you see that?

Yes.

All right.  Let's look now at the "Smart Move"

guide that you talked about on direct.

8       A    Okay.

9            MR. WALKER:  Can you pull that up.

10   BY MR. WALKER:

11       Q    This is something � I think you explained �

12   you prepared this for the American Cancer Society as

13   guidance for people who want to quit smoking; is that �

14   that fair?

15       A    It's a self-help guide to motivate people.  You

16   have a little readiness test that we did to see if

17   people were ready to make a quit attempt, try to

18   motivate them, and then guide them, just like the

19   "Clearing the Air" guide which came out with, I think,

20   the U.S. practice guidelines on treating nicotine

21   dependence.

22       Q    So let's take a look at the readiness test you

23   were just talking about.

24             Do you have what it takes to stop smoking?

25             This is what you were just referring to, right?

1       A    That's riqht.

2            MR. WALKER:  Okay.  Can we get the part that

3       covered � oh, okay.  There you go.

4   BY MR. WALKER:

5       Q    So the first question in terms of is someone

6   ready to make a quit attempt, as you just said:  Do you

7   want to stop smoking?

8             Right?

9       A    Yeah.  All these are a test of whether somebody f

10   is ready to make a quit attempt.

11       Q    Okay.  Do you want to quit smoking? is the

12   first question?

13       A    That's right.

14       Q    Second question � and there's a yes and a no

15   there because some people don't, right?

16       A    Some people are not ready at a given time to

17   quit.  That's true.

18       Q    Second question:  Are you willing to make some

19   changes in your daily routine? 2 0                            Right?

21       A    That's right.

22       Q    There's a yes and a no there because some 2 3       people might not be ready to do that, right?

2 4       A    That's right.  And I would point out these

25       three questions relate to the three sections of the

Veritext Reporting Company 212-2 7 9-9424                        www.veritext.com                        212-490-3 430

1   guide.  So the first section is really on, you know, why

2   you should quit smoking, health effects, the benefits.

3   The second section, developing a plan, changing your

4   routine.  That's discussed there, which was number 2.

5   And then the third section is on, you know, maintaining

6   abstinence and avoiding relapse, which is very common.

7   It talks about nicotine addiction.  It talks about

8   picking yourself back up if you happen to relapse.  So

9   that's the third question.  Putting up with some

10   temporary discomfort after you quit.

11       Q    Oh, you're referring to three:  Are you willing

12   to put up with some uneasy moments after stopping?

13            Right?

14       A    Yeah.  We're talking about nicotine withdrawal.

15       Q    Okay.  And some people may not be ready to do

16   that, right?

17       A    That is true.

18       Q    But you provide there:

19             If you can answer yes to all three questions �

20   you want to stop; you're willing to make the change to

21   your behavior, your daily routine; and you're willing to

22   put up with some uneasy moments after you stop � you

23   can stop smoking. 2 4                             Right?

2 5       A    That's what the guide says.  And as I've

1   explained to you many times and many times have been

2   asked about the guide, that's � really you're ready to

3   make a quit attempt and then go to the other part of the

4   brochure.

5             It doesn't tell you � in fact, if you go to

6   the section on relapse, it talks about the fact that

7   most people are going to have to quit many times in

8   order to be successful.

9       Q    Sure.  Most people, as you said, one try may

10   not be enough.  They may have to try a few times to be

11   successful, right?

12       A    That's true.

13       Q    And the information is in your guide?

14       A    Encouraging people to get the appropriate

15   treatment so their odds of success are enhanced.

16       Q    But before you make multiple attempts, you

17   agree that the individual smoker has to decide whether

18   or not to continue to smoke, right?

19       A    Sure.  As long as they have adequate

20   information and they would know fully all the

21   implications of their decision, I � you know, I think

22   you could then put it on the person.

23            But that was not the case, as we've seen over

24   the decades.  People viewed it as a controversy.

1   question to you, sir, is the individual smoker is the

2   one that has to make the decision to quit?

3       A    True.

4       Q    Okay.

5       A    Once they've gotten hooked, that's true.

6       Q    And certainly if someone doesn't try to quit,

7   they're not going to quit?

8       A    Obviously.

9       Q    That's obvious, right?

10       A    Yeah.

11       Q    Okay.  Perhaps, at least � perhaps similarly,

12   obviously, you have to want to quit in order to quit,

13   right?

14       A    Sure.

15       Q    Maybe this one can be less obvious, but I want

16   to ask you:  Some smokers enjoy smoking and don't want

17   to quit, true?

18       A    That is true.  The enjoyment usually comes from

19   the nicotine and their nicotine addiction, so it's very

20   common for smokers to talk about enjoying smoking or

21   feeling satisfied when they smoke.  And when they

22   abstain even for a brief period, like going to sleep at

23   night and then got to have that cigarette first thing in

24   the morning, they feel better.

1   You were responding about the enjoyment.

2       A    Uh-huh.

3       Q    Some smokers enjoy smoking � and this is the

4   part I want to follow up with � and don't want to quit,

5   right?

6       A    Almost all addicted smokers will say that they

7   enjoy smoking.  And, yes, there � at certain times

8   there are some smokers who say they don't want to quit.

9   Although my experience is that virtually all smokers at

10   some time in their life say they want to stop smoking

11   as � as � as evident from � I think your client has

12   said if the exit gate is ever opened, you know, most of

13   our customers would leave us if they could.

14       Q    And, again, none of the information that you

15   were provided indicates what Mr. Price said about

16   whether he wanted to quit smoking before he finally did?

17       A    That is true.  I didn't review any of the

18   case-specific material in this other than the few items

19   that you shared earlier, which was the death certificate

20   and the brief excerpts of the interrogatories.

8   whether RJR marketed to kids, and you were shown some

1   their advertising campaigns were directed at them, and

2   there was correspondence from various political leaders,

3   members of Congress and so on, to the industry asking

4   them to stop it.

5       Q    Okay.  And that � and that Burrows document

6   that talked about the last 50 years as to what they were

7   doing, is there anything in that document that said

8   except for the time that John Price was a minor?

9       A    No.

10       Q    Let's look at �

11            MR. PRYSOCK:  If you can pull that 1980.

12   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

13       Q    1980.  July 22, 1980, Ed Horrigan.

14            And he became what in a few years?

15       A    President of R. J. Reynolds.

16       Q    And he's writing this in 1980:

17            MDD report on teenage smokers 14 to 17.  Philip

18   Morris had a total share of 59 among 14- to 17-year-old

19   smokers, and, specifically, Marlboro had a 52 share.

20             Importantly, the report further indicates that

21   RJR continues to gradually decline.

22             Hopefully, our various planned activities that

23   will be implemented this fall will aid in some way in

24   reducing or correcting these trends.

25             Is there anything in there about adult smokers?

1   We only market to adults and we don't want people �

2   underage smoking, and we're not going to market to

3   people under age?

4       A    No.

5            MR. PRYSOCK:  Let's pull up that 1987.

6   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

7       Q    1987.  Project LF, Potential Year One Marketing

8   Strategy.

9            Project LF is a wider circumference, nonmenthol

10   cigarette targeted at younger adult male smokers �

11   here's that younger adult.

12            And that was after that memo saying call them

13   younger adults, correct?

14       A    Correct.

15       Q    Primarily 13- to 24-year-old Marlboro smokers.

16            And you were shown another document from around

17   this time that said 18- to 30 � 34, but that was

18   actually when they brought people in and questioned

19   them.  That was actually a focus group, right?

20       A    That's correct.

21       Q    Now, they couldn't publicly bring in 13 year

22   olds and do focus groups about 13 year olds, could they?

23       A    That is correct.

24       Q    All right.  But nothing in this document from

1   they're developing that for.  That doesn't say, We're

2    just going after 18 and above, right?

3       A    That's correct.

4       Q    Did they, in fact, develop Project LF, a wider

5   circumference, nonmenthol cigarette?

6       A    Yes, they did.

7       Q    And what was their marketing campaign around

8   that � huge marketing campaign around that cigarette?

9       A    That was part of the Joe Camel marketing

10   campaign.  It was one of the brands in the � in this

11   period of time, the brand variance of Camel, Camel

12   Lights, Camel Wides, that were marketed predominantly to

13   teenage boys.

14       Q    Was Joe Camel a cartoon?  The advertising was

15   cartoon ads?

16       A    Yes.  A suave character, smooth moves, smooth

17   character.  You know, being suave.  And heavily marketed

18   in magazines that targeted teenagers like Rolling Stone.

19       Q    And what happened to that Joe Camel advertising 2 0        campaign?

21       A    Well, there was quite an outcry about it, and

22   eventually Reynolds stopped � discontinued it and it

23   was � they agreed to stop it because it was, in fact,

24   picking up a tremendous market share of the, you know,

25   14- to 18-year-old market.

4   getting a lot of 13 to 24 year olds?

14            And that's what was said in those documents,

15   right?

16       A    That's right.

17       Q    Have you also seen evidence from people that

18   worked at RJR that admitted they were marketing to kids?

19       A    Yeah.  I've seen actually clips that were done 2 0       of interviews with people who worked within the

21   cigarette companies, and Reynolds specifically,

22   salespeople, who after they left the company, talked 2 3       about exactly what Reynolds was up to.

4             THE COURT:  What does disclosure list mean?

5            MR. WALKER:  We have a 24-hour disclosure rule

14        statement of a person, who did not work at the

MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.  In the rules, periodicals, magazines, and such, those are self-authenticating.  That's not what this is.

But the bigger problem is hearsay, Your Honor. Mr. Prysock � if you accept everything he just said �

THE COURT:  Well, let me ask you a question. When you say hearsay, are these folks going to be saying that somebody at Reynolds told them something?  Is that what you're talking about?

MR. WALKER:  No.  The hearsay is the video itself.

9             This is 20/20.  On the ABC news magazine,

10       20/20, tonight, kids under 21, America's youngsters,

11       are they the new target for cigarette manufacturers?

12        Spokesmen for the industry say no, but cigarette

13       advertising is everywhere � sporting events, rock

14       and jazz concerts, billboards, magazines, and

15       giveaways.

16            For almost 30 years, the research and the

17       warnings on the many harmful effects of cigarette

18        smoking have multiplied.  But, where in 1954 the

19       number of cigarettes sold was 387 billion, this

20       year's estimate is 617 billion.  Now, one fact that

21       may clarify this odd progression of events is that

22       more money is spent for promoting cigarettes than

23       for any other product, and some of this promotion

24        seems aimed at children.

8            Winston tastes good like a cigarette should.

9             The growing evidence that these products were

10       killing people eventually led to their ban from

11       broadcasting.  The tobacco companies, however, still

12        claim that the health hazards haven't been proven.

Even though they say they're not convinced that cigarettes kill, tobacco companies say they voluntarily cancelled their radio and TV ads before Congress banned them.

We feel very strongly that cigarette smoking is an adult custom that one should not even consider until they've each the age of maturity.

What's maturity?

Anyone over the age of 21.

But studies show that 80 percent of all smokers started before they were 21.

The cigarette manufacturers are not interested in obtaining new business from teenagers in our society.

But how can you stay in business if you can't hook the kids?

We've been in business very well, thank you, for some time now without attempting to hook kids. We do everything possible to discourage teenage smoking.

Do they?

Sponsor a tennis tournament that's covered on

television.

And in baseball stadiums, when someone hits a home run, some brand of cigarette gets on TV.  Games like this one have about 40,000 viewers under 21.

When we went to a Team America soccer game, what impressed us is how thorough cigarette sponsorship can be.  You can't go anywhere without seeing Winston.  The ticket takers wear Winston hats.  Once you're inside, you're greeted by young women who give Winstons away.

Even the lady selling programs wears Winstons.

Reynolds Tobacco says the audience here is predominantly adult, but there are lots of kids at soccer games.

The North American Soccer League says soccer is the fastest growing support among teenagers.  Some of the kids here wear their free Winston hats to help keep the sun out of your eyes as you watch the cheerleaders.

Why not?

You just said you don't want to expose kids.

That is not the same.  That is not encouraging anyone to smoke, John.

If the purpose of it isn't to sell cigarettes, why do they sponsor it?  Out of the goodness of their heart?

I would imagine that's part of the reason why they sponsor it, because if they're approached by various people for sponsorship and �

The tobacco companies have been doing a lot of this lately.  Their code says:  We will not give cigarettes away in any public place within two blocks of any center of youth activity.

But here they're passing them out in front of a David Bowie concert.  It's here.

Cigarettes were also passed out at concerts given by the Talking Heads and the Animals.

You pass out free cigarettes at these concerts? I don't see you passing out free cigarettes at Frank Sinatra concerts.

There are many, many adults at those concerts.

Promoters of the concerts say 40 to 60 percent of the audience is under 21.

The Tobacco Code also says:  Don't give cigarettes to anyone under 21.

But we asked a 16 year old to try to get some.

violate the sampling code.

We tried to ask the samplers about all of this, but they said they've been told not to talk to the media.

Sorry.

This videotape made last winter by the Chicago Lung Association shows young people being given Bright cigarettes.  16-year-old Joe was given a pack.

So was Paulette.  She's 18.  And Chris; he's 19.  Seven of nine young people who asked for cigarettes got them.

The Chicago Lung Association sent people out. Kids got them.

I cannot address that.  I can tell you what the sampling code is for cigarette manufacturers, and the sampling companies are sworn to adhere by that code.

But they don't obey it.

They are supposed to obey it.

The Kool ad was shown at this theater in Newton, Massachusetts, right before a performance of "Snow White."  Brown & Williamson says that was a mistake.  It should only run before R and PG films.

Of course, PG means the cigarette ad could run with kids' pictures like "Star Wars" and "Superman."

Even if movie advertising were banned, there would still be cigarettes in movies popular with kids.  These pictures are of "Superman II." Marlboro, made by Philip Morris, is shown at least 13 times.

I asked the Tobacco Institute why Marlboros were shown so often in "Superman II."

Do you think cigarette manufacturers had something to do with that?

Yeah, I think that �

Cigarette manufacturers don't make movies.

But what do you think?  That the moviemaker just showed Marlboro on his own?

Perhaps the moviemaker was a Marlboro smoker.

I think the cigarette manufacturers have the right to advertise their product.  I think they have the right to sponsor a variety of events, as they do.  I don't think it's illegal, so why not.

THE COURT:  Stop.

Now, there were some questions about � there were some questions by the defense about what this lady, whose picture just went off the wall, had said, and I don't recall all of the questions, but I do recall on cross-examination there was some questions about what she had said about the marketing to children.

But I � I can't allow what I saw to be shown to the jury.  It just wouldn't be � it would � I don't know if it's been shown before, but if it's been shown before, maybe there was no objection or maybe it was under a different type of situation when there was no argument about it.

MR. PRYSOCK:  The entire report was on prevalence of youth smoking.  There is an entire chapter, Your Honor, on youth marketing.

The defense has suggested, through cross-examination of Dr. Cummings, that he is out on an island or something and he is making this up because of his bias about them youth marketing.  The entire Surgeon General's report and the findings of the report � and this is a governmental report.

The only reason the Court said that this part wasn't admissible is you said, After Engle, unless they opened the door.  They've now opened the door. The prior Surgeon General reports have come in.

Not only are they making this assertion that is directly refuted by this governmental report � which, by the way, RJR has adopted as an adoptive admission because they reference it on their website.

But in addition to that, they brought in the 2014 CDC report on cross-examination of Dr. Cummings.

Now, they knew the Court's ruling, 2007, regarding governmental reports and Surgeon General reports.  They chose, Your Honor, to bring in and

THE COURT:  Right.

MR. WALKER:  After extensive argument, Your Honor allowed in all � all of the other government reports.  The only ones you excluded, and you specifically identified them in your order, were the 2010, 2012, and 2014 Surgeon General reports.

And your order said that if they could be used at all � this is what you said at the hearing � it would be on cross-examination if a foundation was laid for that.

And you'll see Your Honor put that in the order:  Unless defendant takes the position such that they can be used for purposes of cross-examination.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And let me just tell you, and I � and I am � I appreciate the difference between cross- and direct examination.

Did you, in your cross-examination, use some sort of report from 2014?  Some sort of government report?

MR. WALKER:  That's correct, Your Honor.

And the other was a University of Michigan study.

I didn't show where �

THE COURT:  Can y'all believe that that's my signature?

MR. WALKER:  I don't have a basis for comparison, Your Honor.  I assume so.

9            MR. WALKER:  Well, first of all, the 2012

10       Surgeon General's Report is probably about a

11       thousand pages long.

12             THE COURT:  Well, we're not going to do a

13       thousand pages.

15       they contend �

16             THE COURT:  Well, here's what I'll do then.

17       How about bringing Dr. Cummings in.  I would like

18       you to proffer the 2012.

19            MR. PRYSOCK:  Sure.

2 0                           THE COURT:  Okay.  Dr. Cummings, we're going to |

21       do a proffer here.  And I � I believe at some stage

22       you've probably had a proffer outside of the jury.

23             It's for two purposes.  One is to preserve a

24        record.  The other is to determine whether or not

25       certain testimony can be used.

8   activities of R. J. Reynolds and the other cigarette

10       A    Well, one of the major � they had five major

11   conclusions, and conclusion number 3 says:

5            And I previously read to you the major summary

6       of the report that said the evidence is sufficient

3             Is that correct?

4       A    That is correct.

5       Q    And was that � is that consistent with what

6   your work was on the Surgeon General?  And is that � is

7   the Surgeon General's report part of the foundation upon

8   which you have been relying on and upon which you were

16            MR. PRYSOCK:  The next one, Your Honor, is one

17       you may recall from the pretrial.  There was a �

18       there were letters to schools from R. J. Reynolds,

19       from the marketing department of R. J. Reynolds,

20       discussing:  The � the � the � the cause of lung

The Court ruled at that time that � well, you can put it in there � you can put it out because that's a public statement by RJR, but now that they are taking the position that they didn't market to kids, Your Honor, we simply want to introduce the letters to show that they were sending materials to children, fifth grade, from 1963 or 1968, all the way into the 1990s.

And we have several of those letters, and the Court � and we just simply want to put them in now with the school on it, the address on it and who it was addressed to.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And those � there's a pretrial order limiting that?

MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.

MR. PRYSOCK:  What you said at the time is you said, Well, this is public statements by RJR, but just take off the school or that it was sent to a school.  That was �

THE COURT:  Is that some sort of agreement that y'all had that I would do and you asked me to sign it?  Or is that something you argued before me? Because for some reason it isn't � it isn't tickling my brain.

THE COURT:  Well, I don't recall making the statement that you just made.  I'm not saying I didn't, but I just don't recall.

MR. WALKER:  It's not tickling your brain because � well, I won't try to speculate on it.

You were shown a letter that was sent in 1990, I think it was, to the principal of a school in Willow Ridge, New York.  And it was in response to a guestion about � something about whether they labeled � put �

Well, this is it right here.  Maybe seeing it will help you recall.

It was sent to the principal of Willow Ridge school in response to letters.

THE COURT:  I remember that letter now, yes.

MR. WALKER:  And so Your Honor's ruling was, to the extent that they wanted to use this as a public statement, they could, but if they wanted to imply something about it being given to fifth grade students, that that � that you sustained my objection to that and you said that the � the

12             THE COURT:  Okay.

13            MR. PRYSOCK:  Well, Your Honor, relying on the

14        ruling is one thing.  Using the ruling to your

15       advantage as a sword and then blasting Dr. Cummings

really don't have much support for it.  And it

covered youth marketing, not just during John

Price's lifetime.  Their cross was youth marketing,

across the border, we don't do it.

To not be able to show part of the foundation for his conclusions but to criticize what documents we have shown him as being not very much really hamstrings him.  And it's unfair to cross about the lack of documents when there are more documents and they're blocking the other documents.

THE COURT:  Well �

MR. PRYSOCK:  And this is the other one.

MR. MITNIK:  And there's one more, while we're on it.

MR. PRYSOCK:  There is a whole series of these letters, but these are the two we're going to introduce.  And it's the same thing in 1963 -- and in 1968.  Correct.

THE COURT:  And what was the ruling on this one?

MR. PRYSOCK:  I don't think the Court ruled on this one.

MR. WALKER:  I'm not sure this one was even presented.

Oh, right here.  There we go.

I apologize.  We were scrambling all lunchtime.

Your Honor, we're filing this request for judicial notice.  It's the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 regarding the findings of Congress in promulgating this Act.  And there's case law.  It's very clear.  And I can give the Court the case law that discusses findings, as part of the congressional Act, are part of the Act and therefore under 90.201, Laws of the United States.

THE COURT:  Okay.  Mr. Walker, I'm going to go back to you.

MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  They gave me two letters from two students.  The one up there right now, it says JABM on the bottom left.

What is your objection to that?

MR. WALKER:  My objection is the one we discussed pretrial, that this is a letter that purports to have been sent to a school in Tacoma, Washington, in connection with fourth graders.

It has no connection to this case. Mr. Price never lived anywhere near Tacoma, Washington. And in 1963 he was almost 30 years old.

I don't object, which was essentially Your Honor's ruling before trial, if they want to show portions of it that are simply a setting forth the position of the company.  That was the ruling I came into this trial knowing.

I didn't want that ruling.  I wanted it excluded entirely.  Your Honor's ruling was that the

And so that's where I am still.

THE COURT:  Are you ready?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

Both these were admitted in Sermons.  And they made a big deal about you don't have anything after 1929 talking about RJR and going to high schools and schools other than that document in 1929.

We have other documents that we'd like to show them, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Go ahead.

MR. WALKER:  That's not what I said, Your Honor.  What I said was there is � Dr. Cummings agreed with me.  So he couldn't � the answer to that couldn't be this document.  He agreed that he's never seen a document where someone at

This document is not responsive to that at all or Dr. Cummings would have said so. So I don't see how that has to do with it.

He's mentioned other documents and � I don't want to speak past the point of it being useful.

The � the last thing that he mentioned, I think, relates to the piece of paper he handed me about five minutes ago.  Something about judicial notice.  I don't even know what that is.  I don't know what case law was being referred to.  I'm not prepared �

THE COURT:  Well, if I do anything because of judicial notice, that can be done in the morning as well as this evening.  So that's � that's � that's simple enough.  We don't have to take judicial notice through a witness.  Okay.

That's � like so many things, Your Honor hasn't � Your Honor's rulings, Judge Daniel, Judge Beverly they don't � they're not perfectly matched.  And on this case you said that these � this type of letter could be admitted with redactions.

And so my understanding coming into this trial was that that was going to be the ruling that would apply in this case.  Nothing new has happened.

And it was � there was never a question � there was never a suggestion that I was going to come into court and say, Yes, R. J. Reynolds marketed to teens.  I've never done that.

12             I would have � Mr. Prysock intends to ask

13       that � that:  Have you done studies on youth

14       marketing?  And were they on your own or were they

15       in connection with the Surgeon General?

16            Yes.                                                                                                  |

17            Were your conclusions in the study consistent

18       with what you told the jury?

19             That's not putting the Surgeon General up, but 2 0                 it's his own study.

21             I presume he can talk about that?

22             THE COURT:  Why wouldn't he be allowed to talk

23       about that, Mr. Walker?

24            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I'm not sure what's

25       being proposed now.  He's already given his opinions

go the next step and say the Surgeon General agrees

with me, I think that's bolstering.  If that's

what's being proposed �

THE COURT: Did he, in the original direct, go through his own findings and his own opinions based on his research?

MR. MITNIK:  He gave on his � that's what they've been cross-examining and we're on redirect, yes, sir.

I don't know � he didn't reference the study; I don't believe.  I honestly don't remember.

But my point is when you've been crossed-examined to indicate �

THE COURT:  Let me tell you something:  I agree that � I don't mind, after two days of testimony, if it's appropriately done, to ask this person about whether or not he has done research on his own and �

MR. MITNIK:  As I said it.

THE COURT: I am not going to allow him to be bolstered by the Surgeon General's report. That's not going to happen.

MR. MITNIK:  And I think I hear you.  I want to make sure.

General's report.

MR. MITNIK:  Okay.  In other words, when he says have you studied that, we would or would not be allowed to say:  And was that for the Surgeon General?

THE COURT:  Or words to that effect at all.

MR. MITNIK:  You're saying don't?

THE COURT:  Correct.

MR. MITNIK:  Okay.  That's why I asked because I would have misunderstood.

MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I thought we were finished.  I was just handed a document by Mr. Prysock.  There's some additional documents they want to put in that we haven't yet discussed.

THE COURT:  Is it the document that you brought up earlier that they don't �

MR. WALKER:  I don't � I don't know what this is, Your Honor.  It was just handed to me.  Maybe Mr. Prysock can explain.

MR. PRYSOCK:  This document is a memo from the lawyers, and we'll redact the lawyers � or which firm it is because it happens to be Jones Day.  But so we'll � the pretrial ruling was we should redact law firms.  They didn't want us to redact Shook Hardy, but we will redact Jones Day.

But what it specifically discusses is Dr. Rodgman � there was an implication, or there was actually a statement, that we are showing just drafts of documents.

One of the key documents, Your Honor, is � and you heard a lot of questions about Alan Rodgman, a chemist at R. J. Reynolds.

He's one of the first ones to discuss, in 1959 or 1962:  Evidence accumulated to indict cigarette smoking as a health hazard is overwhelming.  The evidence challenging such an indictment is scant.

This � the only version of this document that exists is a draft.  And the � the insinuation by � the argument to the jury is that we're just showing things that were drafts that were never necessarily shown to higher-ups or anything like that.

This � this memorandum from the law firm

Page 2610 indicates � what it indicates, Your Honor, and I

can show the Court, is that he actually � Rodgman

and smoking health report.

Rodgman recounted an incident which occurred in 1962 or '63 when Hoover confiscated two drafts of R JT ' s written � of this � written by Rodgman dealing with his recommendations on what RJT should be doing in the smoking and health area.  Rodgman said that Hoover called him into his office and essentially threatened to fire him if he ever wrote reports like that again.

So the insinuation that, well, that's just a draft.  We don't know whatever happened, the reason why is because they grabbed the other copies.  It's in their own internal documents.  This is a document that is on their website now, where they discuss what �

THE COURT:  What is the date of that document?

MR. PRYSOCK:  What's the what?

THE COURT:  The date of the document?

MR. PRYSOCK:  1985.

THE COURT:  You want to be heard?

MR. PRYSOCK:  And if you � I was just going to say, if you recall, they put in that 1996 document that it talked about how, in 1973, that earlier one

Page 2611 was not really true.  So this is a 1985 one which

discusses why there's only a draft of the document

from 1962 in their files.

MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, when we were at sidebar, I said that I hoped, since we have realtime, that there would be some attention given by all of us to what actually was and wasn't said.

I've not cross-examined Dr. Cummings about anything being a draft.  Not a single document.

The document that he claims this responds to, the 195 9 Rodgman document, I didn't show it.  I didn't ask him a single question about it except that, when we showed the speech from 1969, I said that there was a reference to the chemical that was in that document.

The word draft � I don't think the word draft has come out of my mouth today or at any time this week at all.  Certainly not since Dr. Cummings has taken the stand.

THE COURT:  So what's the point?

MR. WALKER:  So he's argued to you that this is somehow relevant for something about a draft.  I don't see how that's possible because I haven't raised an issue about anything being a draft. That's number one.

This document was not on their presumptive exhibit list, which is why you are hearing about it for the very first time in the middle of Dr. Cummings's cross-examination.

4:00 p.m.

(The trial continues from Volume 32.)

THE COURT:  Anything else?  I'm going to bring in the jury.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir, Your Honor.  That document I showed you, there was another purpose of that document.  This was from the law firm in 1985, and it discusses Rodgman Smoking and Health Report, which is in evidence, and they asked Dr. Cummings about that report, whether it went to the higher-ups.  He was a low-level chemist at the time; just started with the company.

This document, this RJR document on their website says Rodgman, the chemist who they said just started working there and was low level, recounted an incident which occurred in 1962 or 1963, and the title of this is Rodgman Smoking and Health Report. That document has already been admitted.  When Hoover confiscated two drafts of RDM's written by Rodgman dealing with recommendations on what � I'm reading the wrong part.  It's the Teague part.  I apologize.

MR. MITNIK:  You've ruled on that part.  It's

Page 2621 the Teague part.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Same exact argument, Your Honor, the Teague one from '53.  They said Dr. Teague had just started with the company, you may recall, his second job out of school.

In approximately 1953 Dr. Claude Teague reviewed the smoking and health literature and was surprised by the volume of material which indicted cigarette smoking.  Dr. Teague prepared a report in which he concluded that there was significant literature of which RJRT must be aware, and he recommended that RJRT monitor and respond to this literature.

According to Dr. Teague the law department advised this report should not be circulated. Although copies of this report still exist, he believes that Henry Ram advised that the report be collected and destroyed.

This goes right to what they were asking Dr. Cummings about:  Well, there's no proof that this was ever given or circulated to the president that signed that Frank statement, or anything like this.

This tells in R.J. Reynolds' own words, their counsel's own words, why it wasn't given to the president of the company.

Page 2622 MR. WALKER:  Your Honor has ruled on this.  Do

you want me to �

THE COURT:  Yeah, I do want you to.  This is different.

MR. WALKER:  Very well, Your Honor.  First of all you need to know who wrote this.  You haven't heard.  So when we were doing the Koop document they objected because it wasn't set forth who wrote the document.

That document is an internal privileged document that some lawyer wrote at Jones Day as a part of ongoing litigation.  It's privileged.  The privilege has never been waived.

It would be like if I somehow got my hands on a letter or a memo that Mr. Prysock wrote, Morgan & Morgan, and I came � evaluating some issue in the case, and I came in and said, Judge, we want to use what the lawyers said, the lawyers thoughts and work product in ongoing litigation marked privileged confidential attorney/client work product, and I want to try to use that to prove a point in litigation.  That's not appropriate.

It's the same problem with the document in terms of its disclosure.  That's why it's never been admitted.  And it's privileged.

MR. WALKER:  I think that document was either written by or written for one of my partners.  It's no more admissible now �

MR. PRYSOCK:  I'm not going to use that one.

MR. WALKER:  � than it would be if they found a memo I wrote last week to my partner.  It's not admissible.

THE COURT:  Anything else?

MR. PRYSOCK:  No, sir.

THE COURT:  Okay.  This document is not admissible, and that's PT01996.

Are we ready?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

THE COURT:  Please bring in the jury.

Who do I blame all this delay on to the jury? I'm going to tell them it's not my fault.  I'm just going to say it's not my fault.

MR. WALKER:  Well, Your Honor �

MR. MITNIK:  It's all right with me if you say it's their fault.

MR. WALKER:  Mr. Mitnik is ever gracious.

MR. MITNIK:  You can blame it on Booth.  I'm kidding.

THE BAILIFF:  Jurors entering the courtroom.

(The jury returned to the courtroom, was seated in the jury box, and the following further proceedings were had.)

THE COURT:  Wait a minute.  Look at this.  I think this was on purpose.  Y'all had nothing else to do back there but to figure out something.

Let me digress.  On behalf of the lawyers and everybody, all the parties, and on behalf of the court, honestly the whole time you were not here it's not like anybody was doing other things.  We were working the entire time.  We probably saved much more time by doing that outside your presence than it would have taken to do the various things in your presence.

Anyway, I want to reinforce and say to you again we never intend to waste your time, and I do apologize for the long delay.

And we will go forward at this time, Mr. Prysock.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Thank you, Your Honor.

2                  REDIRECT EXAMINATION (cont.)

3   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

4       Q    Sir, you were asked questions about schools,

5   and we had those older documents about going to schools.

6            Do you remember that?

7       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

8       Q    Have you seen other documents where R.J.

9   Reynolds � not just cigarettes, but R.J. Reynolds

10   specifically was corresponding with schools about issues

11   on smoking and health?

12       A    Yes.  These were in their letters from

13   materials that I've seen from Reynolds.  Thousands of

14   them actually.

15       Q    The first one is PT10 � I'm sorry � PT1252,

16   and this is May 1 � I know what it looks like.  What's

17   the actual date on this?

18       A    May 1, 1968, because they reference the Council

19   for Tobacco Research.  It looks like '63, but CTR was

20   renamed in 1964.  Remember it was TIRC, then went to

21   CTR.

2 2       Q    Who did J.B. Mann work for?

23       A    Public relations at R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

2 4        Company.

25                Q         Actually   an   employee   of   R.J.   Reynolds?

1       A   Yes.

2       Q    Fourth graders, Room 22 Geiger School, Tacoma,

3   Washington.

4             Dear Students, thank you for thinking of us in

5   connection with your school research project.  As you

6   know, opinions regarding smoking and health are by no

7   mean uniform.  Our feeling has always been that smoking

8   is a pastime for adults, and that young people should

9   not smoke.  Despite many years of extensive research,

10   medical science has been unable to establish that

11   smoking has a direct causal link with any human disease.

12   We are firmly of the opinion, however, that definite

13   answers to the many unanswered smoking and health

14   questions, and the true causes of human diseases, can be

15   determined only by scientific research.  Our company

16   intends, therefore, to continue to support such research

17   until the truth is known.

18            And I think we have seen this, but is that a

19   consistent theme that they maintained not just to

20   adults, but to youth also?

21       A    Yes.

22       Q    All right.  Is this the only time � is this

23   the only letter like this, or are there a series of

24   them?

25       A    No.  It's essentially a form letter, so there

1   are many of these that were sent, because Reynolds would |

2   get reguests from customers, as well as from school

3   teachers, or from students, and this is what they would

4   send out along with a pamphlet.  They had various

5   pamphlets they would enclose with the material.

6       Q    Have you seen other letters more recent than

7   this?                                                                                                                   |

8       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

9       Q    If we can pull up the next one, PT1433A,

10   January 11, 1990.  Principal, Willow Ridge School,

11   Amherst, New York.

12             Dear Sir or Madam, a number of your fifth grade

13   students have written R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company

14   commenting that they do not feel our company should

15   allow the use of our brand names on children's toys and

16   candy cigarettes.  Correct?

17       A    Correct.

18       Q    And these entire documents are being admitted

19   into evidence.  We're introducing the whole documents; 2 0        correct?

21       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

22       Q    The jury can read them.

23            Despite all the research going on the simple

24   and unfortunate fact is that scientists do not know the

25   cause or causes of the chronic diseases reported to be

1   associated with smoking.  The answers to many of the

2   unanswered controversies surrounding smoking and the

3   fundamental causes of the diseases often statistically

4   associated with smoking we believe can only be

5   determined through much more scientific research.  Our

6   company intends, therefore, to continue to support such

7   research in a continuing search for answers.  We would

8   appreciate your passing this information along to your

9   students.  You may also be interested in the enclosed

10   publications presenting the position of our company and

11   the tobacco industry on the issue of youth smoking.

12            What were the materials that they would include

13   in these letters when they were sending these out?

14       A    Well, they have a pamphlet that would give,

15   like the white papers, a Q and A on the industry's

16   position about issues related to smoking and health.  So

17   it was the same public statements.

18       Q    Okay.  And those white papers include things

19   about independent scientists research and things like �

20   that were actually working for CTR?

21       A    Yeah.  I mean, we didn't know that those

22   scientists who they quoted in those documents at the

23   time those documents appeared in fact had been on the

24   payroll for the cigarette companies.  However, that

25   became evident when I was able to look at the special

1   project accounts and match up the names of the

2   scientists that they kept quoting over and over again as

3   questioning the link between smoking and disease had

4   actually been hired by the lawyers, selected by the

5   lawyers, and funded to serve � to basically, you know,

6   serve as spokespersons.  I think they served as

7   witnesses in cases for the industry, and they also were

8   quoted over and over again in these white papers.  They

9   appeared in TI materials, they would appear at

10   congressional hearings.

11       Q    Okay.  And the other one we looked at was 1968;

12   right?  And this was much later in time; correct?

13       A    Yes.

14       Q    How did this letter � how did this letter come

15   about in 1990?  Are you familiar with it?

16       A    Yeah, I'm familiar with this letter in

17   particular because I had spoken to the fifth grade

18   classes.  I did for about 20 years when I was up in

19   Buffalo.  This is a suburb of Buffalo, New York, and I

20   was invited into the school to talk to the fifth graders

21   every year, and as I typically would do, I would ask the

22   teachers what the students were learning at the time,

23   and they told me they were learning how to write

24   letters, and I said, oh, they ought to write letters to

25   the cigarette companies and ask them why they use �

1   allow their logos on toys and candy products.  I did my

2   talk on smoking, that was in November, and the school

3   nurse who invited me in contacted me shortly after the

4   principal had received this letter and was surprised

5   about it.  You know, I had it in my file for years.  And

6   then when the internal business records were found, like

7   the earlier one you showed in 1968, virtually the same

8   statement was made over 22 years to people who were

9   writing the companies, including school children, that

10   it still wasn't known whether cigarette smoking caused

11   disease, and over that 22 years there had been many

12   Surgeon General reports, massive extra information, yet

13   this is what was being represented to the children.

14       Q    And let me ask.  You were shown a document.

15   Counsel showed you a document that talked about younger

16   adult smokers terminology.  Do you recall this?  And the

17   subject of this was actually younger adult smokers

18   terminology.

19       A    That's right.

20       Q    It says:  As you all know, the objectives of

21   R.J. Reynolds' marketing practices are to convince

22   existing smokers...

23             Then it says:  It's not our business to

24   motivate people to start smoking, particularly minors.

25            And again this was at the time when things were

6       Q    What was going on at that time as far as

7   public � or as far as governmental looking into the

8   activities of the cigarette industry?

9       A    Well, the government � as I mentioned earlier,

10   the government had actually contacted the companies and

11   were asking them about some of their marketing practices

12   which appeared to be targeted at young people, and so

13   that was at a time of heightened concern.  There were

14   communications from various government officials to the

15   companies.

16            And then now we know when we go back and look

17   internally at their business records they were changing

18   the terminology that they were using in their � in

19   their marketing studies.

2 0       Q    And this document was one that had to be turned

21   over much later in time; correct?

22       A    This was after 1999.

23       Q    And the document was shown to you on cross

24   examination.  It's got a big block that says, privileged

25   material redacted; correct?

1       A    Yes.  That's why � it's always been that way

2   on their website, and so that's why I sort of made the

3   comment that it would be nice to know what's under the

4   redacted part, because that was redacted by Reynolds.

5       Q    So as far as you know, is there any version

6   available anywhere which shows what was redacted?

7       A    I'm sure there is, but I don't � I've not seen |

8   it.                                                                                                                        |

9            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I move to strike the

10       last comment.  It's speculation.

11             THE COURT:  And that motion is granted.

12             Ladies and gentlemen, please do not consider

13       the last sentence about whether that exists

14        somewhere.  Thank you.

15       Q    You were asked about whether youth rates have

16   started declining now under current regulation.  Let me

17   ask you a couple things about that.

18             First of all, in your studies, and their

19   documents � we can pull up the document, Sensitivity 2 0       Price Index.

21             Have you seen which category of individuals �

22   hang on a second.

23             Have you seen which category of individuals are

24   most affected by price increases on cigarettes?

25       A    Yes, teenagers, those who have less disposable

income.

1

2       Q    And what has happened to cigarette prices over

3   the last few years as these � as these youth rates have

4   started to decline?

5       A    Well, as smoking rates and cigarette

6   consumption has gone down cigarette companies have

7   raised their price to maintain profitability.

8       Q    Despite that how many kids in the United States

9   start smoking every day?

10       A    The estimate is about 3000 a day start � you

11   know, will experiment with smoking.  Not all of them go

12   on to become regular smokers fortunately.

13       Q    What percentage of those several thousand do

14   become regular smokers?

15       A    It's about a third.  About a third of those who

16   experiment with smoking will go on and become, you know,

17   persistent regular daily smokers and smoke into their

18   adult years.

19       Q    And that number you gave me today � how many

20   did you say it is every day start?

21       A    About 30 0 0 a day.

22       Q    And that's every single day in the United

23   States.  That's high school and junior high kids?

1             THE COURT:  Sustained.

2       Q    What definition is that of the kids � when you |

3   say kids that start every day, what age groups?

4       A    The low end � age end of the market, which is

5   under 18.

6       Q    Okay.  Let's move on to a different subject.

7   We're going to go kind of quickly on a few of these.

8             I think you were asked about Kool cigarettes

9   and the 1950's at a time when Mr. Price was smoking.  Do f

10   you recall those?

11       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

12       Q    Was Kool cigarette a heavily advertised brand

13   by the company that R.J. Reynolds is now responsible for |

14   in the 5 0's?

15       A    It was � it wasn't as heavily advertised as

16   other brands, but certainly it was an important brand

17   for Brown & Williamson.

18       Q    And was part of their marketing of Kools the

19   Willie the Penguin, the cartoon that we talked about 2 0       previously?

21       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

22       Q    Back in the 50's when Mr. Price was a boy were

23   cigarettes available � could you get cigarettes out of 2 4       vending machines?

2 5       A    Yes.                                                                                                  f

1       Q    How common were vending machines?  And when did

2   vending machines stop being common in the United States?

3       A    Well, vending machines were very common in the

4   United States really up until after 2000 when the price

5   went up on cigarettes, you know, where you had to start

6   putting dollar bills in instead of just coins.  They

7   became less popular, and then in many places they were

8   banned, and then I believe in 1998 I think there was an

9   agreement to end the vending machine business except in

10   certain locations.

11             You can still find vending machines I think in

12   adult venues such as bars and gentlemen clubs, those

13   kinds of things.

14       Q    What's the significance � let me go back to

15   that.  Let me ask you about some of the brands.

16            We have talked about the major brands Mr. Price

17   smoked, but there's also � the jury has been shown

18   every brand that he ever smoked at any point in his

19   life, so let me just ask you to identify the maker of

20   each brand.  Hopefully we can get through this.

21       A    Sure.

22       Q    Just for clarification.  Kool.

23       A    That's Brown & Williamson, now R.J. Reynolds.

24       Q    And R.J. Reynolds is responsible for Brown &

25   Williamson, so any time I say Brown & Williamson that's

1       A    Research and development.

2       Q    Okay.  That's the same as scientific director,

3   or that's the person in charge of R&D?

4       A    Yes, generally it was somebody with a

5   scientific background.

6       Q    So back then, and going forward even, a company

7   like R.J. Reynolds had scientists who would study the

8   actual product and who determined scientifically what

9   was going on with the product; right?

10       A    That's right.

11       Q    Then they would report to the president of the

12   company what they were hired to do, which is determine

13   things about their product; right?

14       A    Yes.

15       Q    And then the president of the company �

16            MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, I'm sorry, I don't

17       want to have to object every time, but these are all

19             THE COURT:  Rephrase.

20            MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

21       Q    Who would they report that information to?

22       A    Well, typically the R&D director would report

23   directly to the president of the company.  That's what

24   the organizational structures show.

25       Q    So with that information from the people they

1   hired to do the research on their own products, the

2   scientists who'd had education in how to do that, who

3   would then ultimately make the decision, once they had

4   that information, on what to do about their public

5   position on smoking and health?

6       A    Ultimately it was up to the president of the

7   company.

8       Q    And that � the president of the company, the

9   president of R.J. Reynolds, could make the decision

10   either way on what as the head of the company he wanted

11   the company to do?

12       A    That's true.

13       Q    All right.  So look at the scientific

14   directors � and you were shown the Frank Statement, and

15   it was signed by the heads of the companies; right?

16       A    That's right.

17       Q    The gentle who were ultimately the decision

18   makers.  And this is � is this December of 1953, right

19   before they made that decision?

20       A    Correct.  This is following that meeting on

21   December 15th.  They reference in that minutes � I

22   think we showed part of the minutes, I don't think we

23   saw that part where they said they had interviewed three

24   of the research directors of the cigarette companies,

25   and they were scheduling one more to be interviewed.

1            And then this forwarding memo was created,

2   which is summarizing the views of � from those

3   interviews that had been conducted to provide

4   information actually internally to Hill & Knowlton,

5   because they had just � their new client, the cigarette

6   companies, they needed information about the companies

7   and the views of the leaders of those companies.

8       Q    Okay.  And so this is one of the scientific

9   directors saying:  Boy, wouldn't it be wonderful if our

10   company was the first to produce a cancer free

11   cigarette.  Right?

12       A    That's right.

13       Q    Okay.  And one of those scientists at R.J.

14   Reynolds that you were asked about before, Allen

15   Rodgman � you were asked about Dr. Rodgman at a time

16   when he had just recently been hired by the company.

17             Do you recall those questions?

18       A    Yeah.  He was � I think I was asked about when

19   he was hired, and that was summer of '54.  Then the

20   studies that he produced, he was hired basically to keep

21   track of the smoking and health issues.  And we showed,

22   I think the document you've got, to the jury probably

23   last Friday.

24       Q    Okay.  And so in this � you said he was hired

25   when?

1       A    He was hired in the summer of '54.

2       Q    Okay.  Let's look at '62 after he had been

3   there for, what, eight years.

4       A    Right.

5       Q    And you've seen this document; correct?

6       A    I have.

7       Q    The Smoking and Health Problem, a Critical and

8   Objective Appraisal, PT3709A.

9            MR. WALKER:  May I have a copy, Your Honor?

10            MR. PRYSOCK:  Can you pull that up?

11       Q    What does he say?  This document will be in

12   evidence.  The jury can read it.  What does he say?

13       A    He's summarizing the evidence, and he

14   essentially does what Dr. Teague had done in 1953.  He

15   is reviewing the published literature, as well,

16   different than Dr. Teague, internal R.J. Reynolds

17   studies are also cited.  But the summary is, based on

18   all that evidence the evidence is overwhelming indicting

19   cigarette smoking as a cause of cancer, and the evidence

20   against that position was scant, was his conclusion.

21       Q    Is this document � this is in the form that

22   became available in the late 90's, or whenever it is, in

23   2000?

24       A    Yeah.  This was internal to the company, didn't

25   see the light of day until the late 90's when the

3        Q    Are you familiar with � based upon other

4   documents, with what happened to this document, copies

5   of this document, or what he was instructed to do?

6       A    Yes.  This document � I am familiar with what

7   was done with this document, and, you know, that he

8   had � it had been given to his boss, Ken Hoover, the

9   head of R&D, and his boss was not too happy with the

10   document, and that's why you only find drafts of the

11   document, because he told them to destroy them.

12        Q    You were shown See It Now, which was a -- when

13   the health scare happened and when -- right around the

14   time 1953 or '54, do you recall that?

20   version in, which is PTD1682, so the jury will be able

21   to see the full version, but let me ask you.  You were

22   asked about Edward R. Murrow, and the question was, was

23   he one of the leading newspaper men at the time?

24       A    Yeah, he was a famous World War II war

25   correspondent, and then he was a newscaster and did the

1   show See It Now, which covered topics of day, sort of

2   like 60 Minutes does today.

3       Q    And he did an in-depth show on the smoking and

4   health controversy; correct?

5       A    Two of them.

6       Q    Not just one, but two of them?

7       A    That's right.

8       Q    Full-length shows just on that issue; correct?

9       A    Correct.

10       Q    And he interviewed people, public health

11   people, and he also interviewed the tobacco industry

12   people, and their version � or their � did he

13   interview both �

18             (Sidebar without the reporter.)

19       Q    Okay.  So Edward R. Murrow, who did he

20   interview as part of those two long episodes?

21       A    Well, he interviewed people like Dr. Wynder,

22   who had done the mouse painting experiments and had

23   published the human clinical studies.  He interviewed

24   E. Cuyler Hammond, who was the statistician from the

25   American Cancer Society.  He interviewed people from the

1   National Cancer Institute, the head of the AMA, American

2   Medical Association.  He interviewed Robert DuPuy, who

3   was the chairman of the TIRC, technical research

4   committee.  He was also the R&D director at Philip

5   Morris.  I think Ed Hartnett, who was formerly the

6   president of Brown & Williamson, signed the Frank

7   Statement.  He was the chairman of the TIRC.  Dr.

8   Little, Clarence Cook Little I think was interviewed as

9   part of the show.  I might have left somebody �

10       Q    Was Edward R. Murrow a smoker?

11       A    Yes, he was a heavy smoker.

12       Q    What did he ultimately die of?

13       A    Lung cancer.

14            MR. WALKER:  Objection.  Relevance as to what a

15       newscaster passed away from.

16             THE COURT:  Sustained.

17       Q    Did Edward R. Murrow publicly discuss � after

18   doing these interviews of these people and conducting

19   these entire shows about the issue of smoking and

20   health, did he later discuss whether he, himself,

21   continued to smoke or was able to quit smoking?

22            MR. WALKER:  Objection.  Relevance as to

23       whether Edward R. Murrow was able to quit smoking.

it's a self-authenticating document.  It's regarding

Mr. Murrow.

MR. WALKER:  I haven't seen it, Your Honor.  I don't know.

(Document tendered.)

MR. WALKER:  I object.

THE COURT:  Come to sidebar. (Sidebar outside the hearing of the jury.)

THE COURT:  Why is it relevant if a newsman died of cancer, or that he thinks it was hard for him to quit smoking, as opposed to any other testimony?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Because it's relevant.  It's not relevant regarding anybody.  It's relevant because they made a big deal.  They showed this clip of him and the show.  They made a big deal about he was a leading newsman at the time, everybody was watching this.  It's a public statement he made later on regarding the issue of smoking.  It goes to the knowledge �

THE COURT:  What was the clip that you showed?

MR. WALKER:  Neither one of us showed a clip of Edward R. Murrow, Your Honor.  It was Edward R. Murrow's television show.  Neither of us showed a

people that Dr. Cummings just discussed, but not

Edward R. Murrow.

MR. PRYSOCK: He asked guestions about Edward R. Murrow and whether it was a popular show at the time .

THE COURT:  What does that have to do � I understand � let me tell you something.  This has come up in front of me before, Edward R. Murrow died, you know, and all that sort of thing.  But where does Edward R. Murrow come up in context of him as opposed to anybody else right now?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Because they have been talking about what the public knew, what the public was aware of, what the public � as far as addiction they put up all kind of documents, public documents, newspaper articles about addiction.

THE COURT:  Edward R. Murrow wasn't on anybody's payroll.

MR. PRYSOCK:  They put up � they were putting up newspaper articles from Utica and from other places around the country that say, you know, the tobacco � the health scare.  It had nothing to do with anything.  It was hearsay in that.

9   BY MR. PRYSOCK:

10       Q    You were asked about Wing cigarettes.  What was

11   one of the main characteristics of Wings as far as the

12   pricing of Wings back in the late 40 's, at a time when

13   the evidence is that Mr. Price smoked them?

14       A    It was a little less expensive.

15       Q    Okay.  You were asked questions about pH

16   levels.

17             Do you recall those questions?

18       A    Yes.

19       Q    We showed documents about those. 2 0       A    Right.

21       Q    Now, to be clear, raising the pH to a specified

22   amount does what, according to their own internal

23   documents?

24       A    Well, when you go slightly above 6 it changes

25   the form of nicotine from its bound form to its unbound

1   form chemically, so you get what they call free

2   nicotine.  It's like freebasing.  You're getting, you

3   know, more effective the drug because it gets more

4   rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream where it can have

5   its, you know, reinforcing effect.

6       Q    And just so it's clear, are you saying that if

7   they keep raising the pH level, keep going up and up

8   it's going to make things more addictive?

9       A    Well, no �

10            MR. WALKER:  Objection.

11       A    � I'm not saying that, because if you get too

12   high �

13            MR. WALKER:  Objection.  There's a pretrial

14        ruling that precludes that question and answer, Your

15       Honor.  This is the one I had the motion on last

16       week.

17             THE COURT:  Overruled.

18       Q    So according to their documents, if you raise

19   it and keep raising it does it just keep accentuating

20   the addictive effects?

21       A    No.

22       Q    What were you explaining as far as the level of

23   pH that they were looking for and that they were � and

24   whether they were � whether it was random or precisely

25   controlled?

1       A    We know it's precisely controlled because they

2   measured it and tracked it very precisely, and

3   engineered it, and tracked their competitors brands

4   around it as well.

5            But you had to have a level that was slightly

6   above 6, so you got this free form.  But if you went too

7   high, like into the 7, or particularly above 8, you get

8   so much nicotine rapidly, it's irritating and

9   overwhelming and unpleasant experience, which is, you

10   know, in other words, impossible to inhale, which is why

11   cigars at approximately 8 on a pH scale is not an

12   inhaleable product.  So people who only smoke large

13   cigars tend not to get respiratory diseases like COPD or

14   lung cancer.  They do tend to get oral cancer if they

15   smoke enough, but they tend not to smoke enough of

16   cigars because the high pH reduces the delivery of

17   nicotine into the airways, the large surface area for

18   rapid absorption hitting the brain; tends not to create

19   an addictive pattern of use, which is why people who

20   smoke large cigars do so occasionally, but they don't

21   have to do it on a persistent daily basis.

22            And so that's the explanation of smoke pH.  Too

23   high is not good if you want an addictive pattern, and

24   too low is not good because that is too acidic.  So you

25   can look at additives at both ends.  Those that modify

1   pH to be more basic and also to be more acidic, and you

2   can see those on the list of additives the companies

3   use.

4        Q    And is there any reason why?  I mean, do they

5   have to raise the pH from the tobacco when they add

6   ammonia and things like that?  Is there any requirement

7   that they do that?

8       A    No.

9       Q    You were asked some questions about polls, and

10   you were shown a few graphs or demonstratives.  Let me

11   ask about a couple others.  If we can pull up PT3686.

12             Before people will be convinced that cigarette

13   smoking is harmful to health, the tobacco industry

14   itself has to say that smoking is harmful to health.

15             Have you seen this poll before?

16       A    Yeah.

17        Q    Okay.  And at the top it says:  Never, ever,

18   former, current.  And what does that mean?

19       A    Well, never is somebody who has never smoked.

20   They have never gotten to a hundred cigarettes in their

21   lifetime.  An ever smoker is somebody who had smoked a

22   hundred cigarettes in their lifetime, but doesn't smoke

23   now.  A former smoker is one who went over the hundred

24   and quit.  Then the current is the person who is

25   currently smoking.

1       Q    Okay.  So under strongly agree, this is � this

2   is after the Surgeon General report had come out;

3   correct?

4       A    Correct.

5       Q    So under the question of before people will be

6   convinced that cigarette smoking is harmful to health

7   the tobacco industry itself has to say that smoking is

8   harmful to health.

9            Of current smokers, of the males it was

10   54 percent � or 55 percent agreed with that, and of

11   females over 60 percent.  Is that right?  Am I reading

12   that right?

13       A    Strongly and mildly agree with that, yes.

14       Q    Agree strongly or mildly; correct?

15       A    Correct.

16       Q    Okay.  And you were shown polls about � later

17   on about the belief of the tobacco industry, or who do

18   you believe the most.  Do you recall those?

19       A    Yes.

20       Q    Okay.  And so the tobacco industry was listed

21   up there.  Now � and that was towards the bottom of the

22   scale; right?  I don't want to pull it up right now

23   unless we have it handy.  I don't want to take the time.

24       A    It usually was the tobacco industry in last

25   place, and The Tobacco Institute was next to last.

1       Q    And then what was way over here on the other

2   side much higher up about independent scientists?

3       A    Well, there were independent scientists, the

4   American Medical Association I think was mentioned,

5   American Cancer Society.

6       Q    When those polls were done, as far as

7   independent scientists and those people, of the

8   surveyors of the people being polled they said

9   independent scientists they would believe at a high

10   rate, was this at a time when CTR and the tobacco

11   companies � well, what were they doing at the time as

12   far as putting the word out from other third parties?

13       A    Well, they � as I mentioned, through special

14   projects they went out � their lawyers went out and

15   found scientists who questioned the link between smoking

16   and disease, they put them on the payroll, they would

17   basically quote their studies, and interview them, and

18   include them in their materials.  So it gave the

19   appearance that there were independent studies

20   challenging the link between smoking and health.

21             I think I showed a Tobacco Institute Project

22   Truth video where the guy was, you know, coming down

23   reading the white paper where he said, independent

24   scientists challenge the link between smoking and

25   disease.

1            Well, all those independent scientists weren't

2   so independent.  They were being paid for by law firms

3   of the cigarette companies.

4       Q    And internally what did they call that strategy |

5   of using third parties who appeared to be independent?

6   What did they call that, themselves internally when they |

7   were discussing it?

8       A    I'm not sure what you're referring to.

9       Q    What did they say about whether that was a

10   successful strategy or not?

11       A    They talked about it being a brilliantly

12   conceived and executed strategy that had been

13   effectively used to create doubt in the public's mind

14   that there was a controversy.  They applauded themselves

15   for doing it.

6       Q    All right.  Who is it from and to?

7       A    This is from the outside counsel to Brown &

8   Williamson.  So it's to the top � well, one of the top

9   lawyers in the law department at Brown & Williamson, and f

10   they're talking about in May of 1963, after the

11   companies had been asked to turn over information on

12   their research to the Surgeon General's advisory

13   committee, how to respond to that request that they had

14   got.

15       Q    Pursuant to my telephone conversation with you

16   and Jim Ravlin on Friday and my conversation with you

17   today, please find enclosed the substance of a proposed

18   letter to the Surgeon General's advisory committee on

19   smoking and health.  I am of the further opinion that

20   any description in the letter to the committee �

21            And the committee was who?

22       A    The Surgeon General advisory committee.

1   as to be irksome to the reader.  I repeat, it is

2   unfortunate that Brown & Williamson must submit

3   anything, but this approach seems to me to be the most

4   innocuous of the alternatives.

5            And you were asked about the Green Monster and

6   whether they turned over information to the Surgeon

7   General.  Did they turn over anything from their

8   internal secret � or what they were looking at

9   internally as far as information that had not already

10   been publicly published from other people and

11   everything?

12       A    We know now that they did not turn over their

13   conclusions that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer

14   that they had arrived at in 1958.  That was part of

15   Brown & Williamson.  We know that they did not turn over

16   their research on nicotine that they had done from 1959

17   to 1963, project HIPPO, which was the conclusion that

18   nicotine was addictive and they were in the business of

19   selling nicotine, an addictive drug.  And they also in

20   that � they didn't send their conclusion that the TIRC

21   was a public relations gesture.  That was something else

22   that Brown & Williamson had concluded prior to the

23   submission to the advisory counsel.  They didn't tell

24   the advisory counsel that.

12   it is axiomatic that it is best to submit the least

13   scientific material possible consonant with the

14   objective of not irritating the committee.

15             Is that what you were talking about, what they

16   did turn over versus what they didn't turn over?

THE COURT:  Take a look at it and tell me if you still have an objection.

MR. WALKER:  I do have an objection.

THE COURT:  Come to sidebar.

(Sidebar outside the hearing of the jury.)

MR. WALKER:  My objection is hearsay, Your Honor.  I thought he was describing a document that was sent from the tobacco companies to the American Cancer Society.  This is the other way around.  This is a letter from the American Cancer Society by William B. Lewis.  I don't know what his qualifications are to make any of these statements, or what the foundation for it is.  It's like the person who wrote the Koop letter, and it can't be a statement of a coconspirator because it's the American Cancer Society.  I don't know what the basis for the hearsay exception is for this.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Exactly.  It was to the president of the Tobacco Institute from the American Cancer Society, and it was asking them to stop promoting that scientific research hadn't yet established whether smoking and health � whether the smoking

or whether they stopped at the time.  This is not

hearsay.  It is � this is in their files, by the

way, and this was on our exhibit list, and this �

well, I'll leave it at that, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  It wasn't secret if it was in their files, in as much as from the American Cancer Society.  I don't mind you asking if there is evidence that the American Cancer Society wrote them asking them to cease and desist.  I do mind if you go through � because then I don't know � I don't think that � that's for the purpose that you're talking about.

But to publish this letter would serve the purpose of being offered for the truth of the matter, and I'm going to �

MR. PRYSOCK:  It's absolutely not offered for that, Your Honor.  And I apologize �

1   with them in 1971, whether they asked the cigarette

2   industry to scale back on the advertising or stop trying

3   to promote that smoking and health controversy because

4   it was affecting their ability to get out the message in

5   those PSA's?

6       A    Yes.

7       Q    What was the tobacco industry's response?  Did

8   they do what the American Cancer Society asked?

9       A    No, they did just the opposite.  They ramped up

10   their activities to continue to deny that cigarette

11   smoking was harmful, the budgets for The Tobacco

12   Institute increased, where they hired more public

4   what did they study regarding smoking and health issues,

individual trial.

I don't think it's relevant. I think it's hearsay. I have no idea how it relates to what we're talking about here.

This document is essentially just the document that's being talked about in that case, and this too is hearsay.  It's not a company document, it's not drafted by anyone who was alleged to be a coconspirator, and they're intending to use it for the truth.  It's not an ancient document.  It doesn't qualify or meet any hearsay exception.

THE COURT:  Is this a Gallup poll result?

MR. PRYSOCK:  This is the Gallup company, which this is their official position on the tobacco industry's use of their polling, which they use extensively and have talked about use of their polling to indicate whether people really knew that smoking was harmful.

THE COURT:  The entire cross examination took hours.  I know it wasn't � but you did have � I thought you did �

MR. WALKER:  I used Roper polls primarily.

THE COURT:  Did you use Gallup polls?

MR. WALKER:  I think I used Gallup polls � was that with Cummings?  I used some early Gallup polls from the 50 ' s.  Belief polls.

THE COURT:  Okay.  And this is what?

MR. PRYSOCK:  This is the Gallup corporation's official position in 1998 regarding their use � the tobacco industry using polls such as theirs to indicate:  It would be incorrect to say that common knowledge about the connection between smoking and lung cancer existed prior to 1960 when less than a majority of the public said they believed this is the cause.

This is the company that once they found out what the tobacco industry was using their polling for, what they're saying about it.

As you can see, what it's talking about is according to Dr. Ford � that is a witness who testified in some trial in 1996 or '97, who did not testify in this trial, and there won't be any testimony from a Dr. Ford.  So the criticism about common knowledge is talking about how Lacy Ford defined common knowledge and how he used the polls, and has nothing to do with what we have been talking about.

THE COURT:  Let me just tell you something.  If you want, I will spend a long time going over all these documents that we're going to have objections to, and I'll resume with this witness in the morning.  I'm not trying to be �

MR. PRYSOCK:  I can't, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  I'm not trying to be a problem for you.  Don't take it that way.  It's not.  But the fact is we can't just � how is the world � I don't

If you had a poll I know how I could admit it, but this is a statement by a third party that's not a party evaluating this stuff.

MR. PRYSOCK:  I don't have an option.  I have to get Dr. Cummings off tonight, so that's fine.

I'm going to deal with this one now.  This is a Philip Morris document from 1990, so we don't have to rush back up here again.  Some Additional Thoughts is the name of the document.  Dr. Cummings is familiar with the document.

I know what the argument is going to be, is that, well, this is a Philip Morris document, it's not ours.  But the reason we want to introduce this document, Your Honor, there's a page � here it is: This is the industry's ultimate public relation sham.

This is their own internal document, and they're talking about the industry, the coconspirators.

This is the industry's ultimate public relation sham.  Our position continues to mislead the public with a wink.

THE COURT:  Who is that by?

MR. PRYSOCK:  This is Philip Morris, one of the

MR. WALKER:  It's unsigned, Your Honor.  That should be the answer to your guestion.  There is no signature.

THE COURT:  Well, if Dr. Cummings can identify it, and � can he identify who did it?

MR. PRYSOCK:  He can identify it as an internal Philip Morris document.

MR. WALKER:  Your Honor, this � I don't think � this certainly wasn't on their disclosure for Cummings.  I don't think this was on their presumptive exhibit list that we prepared for for this trial.  I doubt this has ever been admitted.  I would like an opportunity to check and be heard on it.

I'm not prepared to respond to this piece of evidence that was not identified to us last month on their presumptive list or on their short list for Dr. Cummings.  I don't know what's in there.

MR. PRYSOCK:  It's been admitted in our cases, Your Honor, with R.J. Reynolds present.

MR. WALKER:  I would like the chance to review for our own purposes.

THE COURT:  Go take a review.  I'll take a recess.

THE COURT:  I know they are.

MR. PRYSOCK:  I don't have much left.  Not now anyway.

I'll redact some of the other pages.  I just want that paragraph.  They can just look at that paragraph.

THE COURT:  How do you identify it as a Philip Morris document?

MR. PRYSOCK:  He identifies as a Philip Morris document.  I lay the foundation with him.

THE COURT:  Was this provided to counsel?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, it was a pretrial exhibit. We gave them all our exhibits, Your Honor.  This has been admitted before in one of our cases.

THE COURT:  I was just told by counsel that he was not provided this.

MR. PRYSOCK:  That's not correct, Your Honor. What he was saying is it was not on the presumptive list.  The presumptive list, as I said time and time again because I knew this would happen, the presumptive list was not the end-all-be-all list.

other documents depending on how things go on cross

examination, because I knew this would start

happening.

MR. WALKER:  That's not my issue.  My issue is when he says it's on our exhibit list, which I think earlier they represented was 12,000 documents, I did not come to trial prepared to address 12,000 documents, when we had pretrial hearings on the 200-or-so that were presumptive.

So if this had been on their disclosure for Dr. Cummings I would have pulled it off the big list and been prepared to address it.

MR. PRYSOCK:  I just want this paragraph.  You can look at that paragraph, just the one paragraph.

THE COURT: You're so uptight, but I understand it.  I truly do.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Your Honor, it's frustrating because I just spent seven hours with them doing the exact same thing.

I'm sorry, Your Honor.  It is on the presumptive list, even though it was represented to you that it wasn't.

I'm sorry.  It was actually overruled.  PT5837.

9       lays a foundation that Philip Morris is a

11       you just told me that it was on the presumptive

18            MR. WALKER:  One additional issue, Your Honor.

19       The best I can find out so far is that where this 2 0                was admitted it was admitted with redactions.

21             This paragraph he wants to read is talking

22       about litigation, what plaintiffs have to prove in

23       the case, the problems with a litigation position.

12       Q    Doctor, you were asked about whether you are

13   paid for your time now, and you mentioned a word, you

14   said when you did the Engle case, when you testified in

15   that case pro bono, what does pro bono mean?

16       A    I did it on my own time and didn't charge

17   anything.

18       Q    And when you did the Engle case pro bono did

19   you think that would be the end of your � of testifying |

20   in litigation?

21       A    Yes, I did.  I testified twice in that case

22   over the 18-month period of that case.

2 3       Q    You were asked about the money that you have

24       been paid, and you were shown a list of the cases.

2   deposition and doing cross examinations like they were

3   doing of you the last seven hours or so?

4       A    Yes.

5       Q    Have they done that repeatedly in those cases?

6       A    Yes.

7       Q    And asked you questions, the same types of

8   questions that you were being asked today?

9       A    True.

10       Q    What's the longest deposition you've had to

11   give to defense when they're asking questions the entire

12   time?

13       A    Well, probably 16, 17 hours of deposition.  I

14   recall going to 2 in the morning at one point.

15       Q    Where they're asking you questions the same

16   time � where they're asking you the same types of

17   questions?

18       A    Yes.

19       Q    And you asked to be paid for that time when

20   they're asking you all these questions?

21       A    I did, although my rate went up.  They seem not

22   to want as much time when I charged them more money.

23       Q    And do you get all the money for your time that

24   you charge?

11   foundation.

16       What Dr. Cummings does with his money and with

17        indigent patients is not relevant.

18             THE COURT:  The relevance has to do with the

19       cross examination having to do with what he gets

20       paid, and this is followup of that, not how he

21        spends his money.  He says it's paid directly to the

8       Q    Does it say that in the first sentence of the

17   spokesmen, legislative positions, and litigation.  And

18   that's essentially what they talk about in this

19   document.

20       Q    All right.  If we can pull up PT5837.  And is

21   that what you just discussed:  Some Additional Thoughts.

22   Philip Morris wants to reevaluate its historic position

23   on smoking and health in three different venues:  Public

24   statements which its executive and spokes men make,

25   legislative, and litigation.  The overriding admonition

1   is that nothing said can adversely affect our litigation

2   position.  Is that correct?

3       A    Correct.

4       Q    Okay.  Then they discuss the industry in this

5   document, and what the industry has been doing over

6   these last decades that we have been talking about for

7   the last day and-a-half?

8            MR. WALKER:  Objection leading.

9             THE COURT:  Overruled.

10       A    Yes.

11       Q    All right.  If we can go to that page.

12             For purposes of the litigation the industry is

13   not willing to concede anything.  In the litigation

14   venue we will require plaintiffs to prove causation both

15   legally and scientifically.  The problems with this

16   position are obvious.  It sounds duplicative.  On the

17   one hand, in order to get more favorable legislation or

18   create a better environment for ourselves we take one

19   position, on the other we intend to play hardball with

20   the victims of the cigarette smoking when they press

21   their claims in the courtroom.  This is the industry's

22   ultimate public relations sham.  Our position continues

23   to mislead the public, with a wink.

24             Dr. Cummings, in 1994, or any time prior to

25   that, did the industry admit publicly that they were

1   misleading � that their position continues to mislead

2   the public, with a wink?

3       A    No.

4       Q    Okay.  Last two things and I'm done.  Just to

5   make sure we get these in for review later.

6             The 1990 Surgeon General report.  Is there a

7   discussion about public awareness of the health effects

8   of smoking even in 1990?

9       A    Yes.

10       Q    If we can look at that.  Okay.  Public

11   awareness of the health effects of smoking has increased

12   substantially throughout the years.  Nevertheless,

13   important gaps in public knowledge still exist.  Some

14   smokers may have failed to quit because of the lack of

15   appreciation of the health hazards of smoking and the

16   benefits of quitting.

17             In the 1987 national health interview survey of

18   cancer epidemiology and control, respondents were asked

19   whether smoking increases the risk of various diseases,

20   lung cancer � and they list other ones, including

21   emphysema � and whether smoking cessation reduces the

22   risk.  30 to 40 percent of smokers either did not

23   believe that smoking increases these risks, or did not

24   believe that cessation reduces these risks.  These

25   proportions correspond to 15 to 20 million smokers in

1   the United States.  Clearly our efforts to educate the

2   public on the health hazards of smoking and the benefits

3   of quitting are not yet complete.

4             Is that consistent with what you have seen?

5   And at the time you were working in epidemiology and

6   trying to get people to quit smoking; correct?

7       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

8       Q    Even in 1090 or '87 a significant amount of

9   people, 30 to 40 percent of smokers, 15 to 20 million

10   people, did not believe that smoking caused disease?

11       A    Correct.  Specifically serious diseases like

12   cancer, emphysema, heart disease.

13       Q    And was this � this was done within a few

14   years, or a couple years of this memo we just talked

15   about?

16       A    Correct.

17       Q    Where it was talking about their position to

18   the public and what they were doing?

19       A    Yes.                                                                                                  | 2 0            MR. PRYSOCK:  Thank you, Dr. Cummings.  That's

THE COURT:  I understand.  I hate to keep you folks here, but we're going to have to take a recess for about 20 minutes, and hopefully then if you take 20 minutes we will be completed by 6.  That will give you an opportunity to call home, or do whatever you need to do.  We'll be taking a recess for about 20 minutes.

	RECROSS EXAMINATION

2
	BY MR.
	WALKER:

3
	Q
	Dr. Cummings, let me ask you about this last

4
	docume
	nt that you were shown that just says Some

5
	Additional Thoughts.  That's the one you were talking
	
6
	about
	a few minutes ago; right?

7
	A
	Yes, sir.

8
	Q
	Now, you've been on the stand here � this is

9
	your third day testifying; right?
	
10
	A
	That's correct.

11
	Q
	You came into court, you raised your right

12
	hand,
	you sworn to tell the truth; right?

13
	A
	That's right.

14
	Q
	You marched up and sat in that witness stand;

15
	right?
	

16
	A
	We all saw it.

17
	Q
	And both sides were able to ask you questions

18
	about
	the opinions that you gave in this case?

19
	A
	Correct.

20
	Q
	Both sides were able to try to show the

21
	strengths or weaknesses in the opinions that you gave;
	
22
	right?
	

23
	A
	Sure .

24
	Q
	While you were sitting there testifying you

25
	talkec
	about your credentials; right?

	I was asked about them, yes.

	Q
	The jury has had a chance to evaluate your

	demeanor
	in answering questions; right?

	THE COURT:  Sustained.

	Q
	This document that you showed the jury, who

7
	wrote it
	?                                                 1

8
	A
	I'm not sure who the author was.

9
	Q
	Was it a man or a woman?

10
	A
	I'm not sure who the author was.

11
	Q
	What was the author's position at Philip

12
	Morris?
	

13
	A
	I don't know.

14
	Q
	What was the author's experience that they

15
	used, if
	any, to say whatever is written in this

16
	document
	?                                                 1

17
	A
	I don't know.

18
	Q
	All right.  Let me ask you about this one.  You ji

19
	read a p
	srtion of this area at the top; right?

20
	A
	Correct.

21
	Q
	This is a White and Case document; right?

22
	A
	That's correct.

23
	Q
	I want to read this part at the bottom that I

24
	don't th
	ink was read in the questions you just answered.

1   going to submit to the Surgeon General's committee;

2   right?

3       A    That's correct.

4       Q    At the end it talks about Reynolds, and says:

5   Reynolds handling of the matter is of course simplified

6   by its being in a position to deliver a considerable

7   amount of published matter.  Right?

8       A    Correct.

9       Q    Let's look at this document that you showed.

10   This was a Rodgman document that you just went over;

11   right?

12       A    That's right.

13       Q    And you read � or you described this first

14   part here at the top that's underlined; right?

15       A    I did.  Actually, I don't think we showed the

16   document.  I just was asked what it showed.

17       Q    It was on the screen for a moment, but you

18   described this first sentence; right?

19       A    Right.

2 0       Q    Obviously the amount of evidence accumulated to

21   indict cigarette smoke as a health hazard is

22   overwhelming.  The evidence challenging such an

23   indictment is scant.  Right? 2 4       A    That's right.

25       Q    The document continues on:  However, the

1   evidence from epidemiological, pathological, biological,

2   and chemical studies supporting the proposition that

3   lung cancer is caused by or associated with cigarette

4   smoke is paralleled by similar evidence supporting the

5   proposition that lung cancer is caused by or associated

6   with air pollutants.  In some instances the evidence

7   seems to be stronger in support of cigarette smoke as a

8   causative or associated factor.  In other instances the

9   evidence seems to be stronger in support of air

10   pollutants as a causative or associated factor.  Right?

11       A    Yes.

12       Q    Okay.

13       A    In order to understand that you need to read

14   the next paragraph.

15       Q    Let's take a look at this document that you

16   showed.  It's getting late in the day.

17             You showed this document from 1963.  Remember

18   showing this one?

19             THE COURT:  Don't talk right now.  Thank you.

20       Q    From 1963; right?

21       A    No, 1968, sir.  It references the Council for

22   Tobacco Research in the next paragraph down, and that

23   organization with that name did not exist until

24   March 1964.

2
	A
	
	I think that was explained to the jury.  Yes.

3
	Q
	
	Okay.  All right.  Now, this was a letter that

4
	was se
	nt
	in response to something that was sent to the

5
	company;
		right?

6
	A
	
	Correct.

7
	Q
	
	And it's then going out to fourth graders at

8
	this Gei
		ger school in Tacoma, Washington; right?

9
	A
	
	That's right.

10
	Q
	
	How old was Mr. Price in 1968?

11
	A
	
	He would have been 27 or so.

12
	Q
	
	32; right?

13
	A
	
	Yeah.  32.

14
	Q
	
	You certainly weren't suggesting that Mr. Price

15
	was a
	fourth grader at Geiger school in Tacoma,
	
16
	Washir
	igt
	on, were you?

17
	A
	
	No, I wasn't.

18
	Q
	
	All right.  So this letter that was sent to

19
	other
	pe
	ople in Tacoma, Washington told these fourth

20
	graders
		that the company's feeling has always been that

21
	smokir
	ig
	is a pastime for adults.  Is that right?

22
	A
	
	Yes.                                             1

23
	Q
	
	And that young people should not smoke; right?

24
	A
	
	It does say that.

	You agree with that sentence, don't you, that

	A
	
	I agree that was the public position of R.J.

		;

4
	Q
	
	Do you agree that young people should not

5
	smoke7
	
	

6
	A
	
	No one should smoke.

7
	Q
	
	All right.  Whether or not adults choose to

8
	smoke
	is
	of course a matter of individual preference;

	rights
	
	

10
	A
	
	That's what it says.

11
	Q
	
	You showed this document from 1990, the one

12
	that went to Amherst, New York.  See that?
		
13
	A
	
	Yes.                                             |

14
	Q
	
	That one was from 1990; right?

15
	A
	
	Correct.

16
	Q
	
	Mr. Price would have been 54 years old in 1990;

17
	rights
	
	

18
	A
	
	That's true.

19
	Q
	
	And certainly you don't believe that Mr. Price

20
	was a
	54-
	-year-old fifth grade student in Amherst, New

21

2       Q    And again it says:  R.J. Reynolds Tobacco

7       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

8       Q    That's consistent with the letters that R.J.

9   Reynolds was sending not to the public, but to various

10   confectionaries, vending machine companies, and video

11   game makers; right?

12       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

13       Q    And then it goes on:  The tobacco industry

14   considers smoking to be a custom for those adults who

15   derive pleasure from it.  See that?

16       A    I do.                                                                                                |

17       Q    We believe that whether to smoke or not is a

18   decision that should be freely made by individuals who

19   have reached the age of mature judgment. 2 0                            Do you see that?

21       A    I do.                                                                                                |

22       Q    All right.  This is not a document that was

23   telling fifth grade students that they should smoke, is

2 4        it?                                                                                                                                 |

2 5       A    No, it wasn't.

1       Q    And it's not a document that shows that anybody

2   went on to any school campus to hand out cigarettes, is

3   it?

4       A    No.

5       Q    The same is true for the last one with fourth

6   graders.  That document was telling fourth graders that

7   smoking is for adults; right?

8       A    It did say that.

9       Q    All right.  Now, you said that you played �

10   you talked a little bit about the role that you played

11   in the creation � that led to the creation of this 1990

12   letter; right?

13       A    No, I didn't.  That letter is a form letter, I

14   think is what I explained to the jury, because I found

15   many versions of that letter within the files of

16   Reynolds.  So I didn't create the letter.

17             I described that I had gone to the school and I

18   had asked the teachers what the students were learning,

19   and I had mentioned to the teacher that they might want

20   to have the students write to the companies.

21       Q    Let me stop you right there and ask you about

22   that.

23             You were the one who encouraged the students to

24   write the company in the first place; is that right?

25       A    I didn't encourage the students.  I mentioned

1   it to the teacher, and the teacher obviously followed

2   up.  I didn't know what the students had done, but I got

3   the call from the school nurse when the letter was

4   received, and that's how I ended up getting a copy.

5       Q    It was your suggestion to begin with; right?

6       A    Sure.  Yes.

7       Q    And Reynolds did not respond directly to the

8   students even though you had asked the students � or

9   you � it was your suggestion.  Reynolds didn't respond

10   to the students, did it?

11       A    No.  They responded � the letter was addressed

12   to the principal of the Willow Ridge elementary school.

13       Q    And it was up to the principal of that school

14   to decide whether or not that letter would be shared

15   with any of the students; right?

16       A    Correct.

17       Q    And in fact, at that time in '90 when this

18   letter that you showed the jury was sent you know that

19   it was not shared with any of the students; right? 2 0       A    That's true.

21       Q    It did come to later be shared with the

22   students when you shared it with them.  Isn't that

23   right?

24       A    Correct.  When we � the other public documents

25   became available we had a press event in western New

1   York where the children held up the letters that had

2   been written to school children basically telling the

3   American public, and anybody who would read or receive

4   those letters that the companies denied that cigarette

5   smoking was a cause of harm to human health, which was a |

6   lie.

7       Q    You suggested that letters be written to the

8   company?

9       A    Yes.                                                                                                  |

10       Q    Letters were sent to the principal who did not

11   share it with the students; right?

12       A    That's correct.

13       Q    You shared it with the students; correct?

14       A    After 2000.  I think the press event was held.

15   We had David Gerlitz, who had been the former ad model

16   for Winston cigarettes appear.

17       Q    Dr. Cummings, yes or no.  You shared it with

18   students; right?

19       A    I did after 2 0 00.

2 0       Q    And now you use it in your testimony when you

21   come to trial when you're making the money that we heard |

22   about earlier; right?

23       A    That's not what generated the letter, but, yes,

24   I think the letter is relevant to the position that

25   Reynolds had and they took with all segments of the

	i
	including telling students what their position

2
	was re
	lated to smoking and health.
	
3
	Q
	
	Let me ask you this, Dr. Cummings.  Both of the

4
	letters
		we looked at talk about cigarette smoking being

5
	an inc
	ividual choice; right?
	
6
	A
	
	That's right.

7
	Q
	
	And surely you would agree that cigarette

8
	smokin
	g
	is in fact and individualized smoking behavior;

9
	right?
	
	

10
	A
	
	I don't know what you mean by that.

11
	Q
	
	The behavior varies from individual to

12
	indivi
	du
	al; right?

13
	A
	
	Sure .

14
	Q
	
	A person � two sisters, for example, could be

15
	offere
	d
	cigarettes, the same cigarette packs; right?

16
	A
	
	Okay.                                            \

17
	Q
	
	And one sister could smoke the cigarette, get

18
	sick,
	an
	d decide to never smoke again; right?

19
	
	
	MR. PRYSOCK:  Objection.  Outside the scope.

20
	
	
	THE COURT:  Overruled.

21
	Q
	
	Is that correct?

22
	A
	
	Sure .

23
	Q
	
	The other sister, smoking a very similar

24

1       A    That's right.

2       Q    And even amongst people who are smokers � you

3   could have two brothers, one brother who is a smoker,

4   smoking the same cigarettes with nicotine that can cause

5   disease, might decide that he wants to keep smoking;

6   right?

7       A    Well, most people in my experience who keep

8   smoking do so because they're addicted to nicotine.

9       Q    That wasn't my question.  My question is, two

10   people who are smoking cigarettes, one might decide to

11   try to quit for his own reasons; right?

12       A    Right.

13       Q    Like meeting someone new who doesn't want him

14   to smoke; right?

15       A    Sure.

16       Q    The other one could decide to continue smoking

17   and say he doesn't want to quit smoking; right?

18       A    Sure.

19       Q    And you wouldn't be in any position to tell any

20   cigarette smoker who smokes and says he or she doesn't

21   want to quit, you wouldn't be in any position to call

22   into question that statement that they don't want to

23   quit, would you?

24       A    In a hypothetical like that that's true.

1   the questions you were asked about brands.

2             You went through � you were asked about a

3   bunch of them.  You left a few out from the list that

4   the jury saw.  On your list you know that Mr. Price

5   smoked Marlboro cigarettes; right?

6       A    True.

7        Q    Who made those?

8       A    Philip Morris.

9       Q    What about Wing cigarettes; who made those?

10       A    R.J. Reynolds.  Brown & Williamson originally,

11   and Reynolds has assumed legal responsibility for Brown

12   & Williamson.

13        Q    Chesterfield.  Who made those?

14       A    Liggett & Myers.

15        Q    Parliament?

16       A    Philip Morris.

17        Q    L&M?

18       A    Liggett & Myers.

19       Q    Now, when we talked about Kool we were able to

20   use a document and look at a chart and see how popular

21   Kool cigarettes were from '52 to '54; right?

22       A    Correct.

23        Q    For any of the brands that you went over with

24   Mr. Prysock:  Winston, Pall Mall, Kent, Camel, Lucky

25   Strike, Old Gold, Doral, Tareyton, Viceroy, Vantage,

1   Salem, Philip Morris, or the ones I just asked you

2   about, Marlboro, Wings, Chesterfield, Parliament, L&M,

3   you don't know how heavily any of those brands were

4   advertised during the years that Mr. Price smoked them,

5   do you?

6       A    That's incorrect.

7       Q    You know how heavily they were advertised in

8   the years Mr. Price smoked them?

9       A    Sure.  Yeah, there's the NCI monograph.  I

10   think it's Monograph 13 or 19, I believe that's on �

11   that came out in 2008 or 2009, has the advertising

12   expenditures for popular brands.  I'm not sure they have

13   every one of the brands you mentioned, but they have

14   them year to year for many of the brands.

15       Q    How heavily advertised were L&M cigarettes the

16   years Mr. Price smoked them?

17       A    L&M.  During � I don't know what years he

18   smoked them.  I don't have those details.

19       Q    How heavily advertised were Parliament

20   cigarettes during the years Mr. Price smoked them?

21       A    I don't have those years.  I didn't review the

22   case-specific material, as you know.

23       Q    How heavily advertised were the Old Gold

24   cigarettes that Mr. Price smoked when he smoked them?

25       A    I don't know the years, so it would be

1   dependent on the years.

2       Q    Let me ask you.  For all the brands you went

3   through, you do not know how heavily advertised any of

4   them were during the years that Mr. Price smoked them,

5   do you?

6       A    Well, I know that he wouldn't have smoked

7   Winston until after March '54, because it didn't exist.

8   So I've seen the advertising expenditures for Winston

9   cigarettes from that date forward.

10       Q    You don't know how popular any of those brands

11   were during the years that Mr. Price smoked them?

12       A    I know that Winston � and there's a chart

13   actually in that same document that you showed for Kool

14   that shows the market share for Winston cigarettes, and

15   they also comment on the success of the marketing for

16   that between 1954 and 1984.

17       Q    But the truth is you have no idea when Mr.

18   Price smoked Winstons, do you?

19       A    It would have to be after '54, but I don't have

20   any other details than that.  That's just based on my

21   knowledge of when Winston was introduced by your client.

22       Q    Last question, or nearly last question.

23             You have no idea what the pH levels were of the

24   smoke in the cigarettes that Mr. Price smoked during the

25   years that he smoked them, do you?

MR. WALKER:  Yes, Your Honor.

Your Honor, it's � I need to move for a mistrial.  Over our objection you permitted plaintiff's counsel to read the portion of a document that suggested that there is a sham and a misleading of the public through claims made in the courtroom, in particular, claims that are holding plaintiffs to their burden of proving causation.

I raised that issue at sidebar.  You accepted the arguments of plaintiff's counsel that this should be included.

This document has only ever been admitted, as far as I'm aware, in Duval with a redaction, and the redaction was the portion that Mr. Prysock read,

Page 2700 which right after the sentence about pressing claims

in the courtroom it says, this is the industry's

ultimate public relations sham.  Our position, i.e.,

our position in the courtroom, continues to mislead

the public, with a wink.

That was required to be redacted in the Allen trial, Allen 2 two years ago, and to allow them to suggest that there was some conspiracy to mislead the public through litigation, through holding plaintiffs to their burden of proving causation, which is what it says at the beginning, has deprived us of the ability to have a fair trial, Your Honor.

THE COURT:  Response.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir, briefly, Your Honor. It has been admitted in other cases, in addition to that, without that redaction.  But additionally, Your Honor, for the reasons we discussed at the bench, this document was specifically discussed and argued at the pretrial.  At that time I asked � they said they may have redactions of portions of the documents.  And, by the way, this isn't later on, this is exactly � this is at page 479 of the pretrial transcript.  Exactly after this document was identified they said � Mr. Walker said that he hoped you would at least entertain redactions of the

Page 2701 portion of those documents that the court had just

ruled on, and I said:  For the record, if they can

let me know what they would like redacted prior to,

and you said prior to the start of the trial, and

they said yes.  Then you said otherwise you've

waived it.  And Mr. Walker said very well, Your

Honor.

So they were on notice that any redactions they wanted specifically related to this document they needed to tell us about before trial.  They did not. They were on notice that they would waive it.  They have waived it.

All that aside, Your Honor.  This document doesn't just � it's not talking about a specific litigation.  It's talking about the industry's position in regards to their public position on smoking and health and how that interplays with their position in litigation.  Not a specific case, Your Honor.

But as the court has seen over the last several days, there are many, many documents that talk about a big part of the reason the industry was taking the position they were publicly regarding smoking and health is because of two things.  One, it was being dictated by litigation strategies, and, two, it was

Page 2702 something that they decided we need to keep this

publicly, this statement, for the reasons our

attorneys are dictating our policy decisions on

smoking and health that they are saying publicly.

So to somehow interject or say now, well, it's got the word litigation in it, therefore it can't be used, even if they haven't waived it already, Your Honor, it is � it is intertwined in such a way, their position, in litigation and public policy on smoking and health that there is no way to separate it, Your Honor.

And it should not be separated, because as their own documents discuss their lawyers are the ones dictating how they view smoking and health, including which independent scientists to hire to do research and things like that.

THE COURT:  Let me ask you a question.  That document came from where?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Philip Morris.

THE COURT:  How was it obtained?

MR. PRYSOCK: They had to produce it. It's on their website. It's part of the documents they had to produce.

THE COURT: They had to produce it pursuant to what?

pursuant to either court order or part of the Master

Settlement Agreement.

All of these documents that we have talked about internally, except for the ones that were leaked out by a paralegal, smuggled out from the Brown & Williamson law firms, but most were pursuant to either agreements in litigation or forced to be produced as part of litigation, and then they had to put out on their websites, as that one is.

THE COURT:  That's where that one comes from?

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes, sir.

MR. WALKER:  If I might, Your Honor?

THE COURT:  Yes.

MR. WALKER:  We're now having turnabout, because a day or two ago I argued with transcript cites, e-mails, and all the rest that the document we were seeking to use, to which Mr. Prysock was objecting, or Mr. Mitnik was objecting, had never been objected to before, when Your Honor asked the question point blank whether there were objections. And I said, Your Honor, you set up this procedure so that we could avoid having these arguments at trial. You asked if they had objections to our documents. They did not articulate an objection to it.  They

You rejected that argument, but you've accepted that argument now that they are saying that we should have redacted something.  Well, it can't �

THE COURT:  I'm not accepting that one way or the other.  It is not redacted.  And that document was, although plenty � not plenty, several were disallowed, that document was specifically allowed in response to the cross examination of this particular witness.

MR. WALKER:  Not this one.

MR. PRYSOCK:  Yes.

THE COURT:  Yeah.

MR. WALKER:  There was no cross about pressing claims in the courtroom.  This is talking about in the courtroom.  The discussion that we had about being responsive to other things wasn't about this document.

Their only argument to permit this document was that we supposedly waived something, when just a few days earlier they argued that failing to object early was not a waiver.

Just so Your Honor is aware, this document, which is a Philip Morris document, has not ever been admitted anywhere in the state where Philip Morris

2             I objected to foundation.  Mr. Prysock didn't

3        even ask the questions, so I asked, and it became

4        clear that Dr. Cummings has literally no idea what

5        human being wrote this.  Mr. Prysock was talking

6        about outside counsel.  There's not even been a

7        basis to say this was written by outside counsel.

8        There's no information about who wrote this, or

9        when, or what their credentials were, or on whose

10        authority they were speaking, none of that.  It is

11        simply a document that they've been allowed to put

12        in front of the jury to say that Philip Morris in

13        the litigation venue requiring plaintiffs to prove

14        causation legally was pressing claims in the

15        courtroom, and that that position misleads the

16        public and is a public relations sham.

17             That is the part that they read.  Now we �

18        there certainly was no waiver as to the objections

19        to foundation.  We have always objected to the

20        foundation of Philip Morris documents.  I objected

21        at sidebar.  You said they could try to raise an

22        issue of foundation.  I objected that he hadn't

23        established the author, the date, the place, or �

24        I'm sorry � the date of the document, or that it

25        was circulated to anyone.

Page 2710 statement � you may recall you kept asking me about

Philip Morris prior to trial and whether Philip

Morris was still a defendant because they still

were, and you kept asking me at each pretrial if

they were gone.

We entered into a stipulation.  The reason they weren't yet is because we were waiting for the signed stipulation back.  We got the signed stipulation back signed by R.J. Reynolds.  And this is why it was important to get this back, because the stipulation that they signed reads as part of our settlement:  Te remaining defendant, which is R.J. Reynolds, stipulates that any smoking by decedent of any cigarettes manufactured by Philip Morris USA was minimal and did not directly and in natural and in continuous sequence produce or contribute substantially to producing any injury sustained by decedent, if any, that was caused by smoking cigarettes.

So I'm just asking that the court read that.

THE COURT:  I'm not going to read it tomorrow. Let me ask you this question.  Why can't that be added to the list of stipulations that I'm going to do in the final instructions?

to think about it.

THE COURT:  Think about it and talk to me about it tomorrow.  I'd much rather read a stipulation then than to read a stipulation in the middle of a trial.

MR. WALKER:  I may very well agree to that, Your Honor.

MR. PRYSOCK:  And the reason is because there's been a lot of questions about Philip Morris made that, not R.J. Reynolds.

THE COURT:  Let me just tell you.  If it's read as a stipulation at the end of the trial I don't want there to be any implication that there was somehow some sort of misleading about that during the trial by defense counsel.

MR. PRYSOCK:  I'm not going do that.

THE COURT:  That's fine.

MR. PRYSOCK:  As long as it's clarified to the jury.

THE COURT:  If it is in the stipulation that I read to the jury I think that's � and they're going to take that to the back room, I think that's about as clear as I can possibly be.
